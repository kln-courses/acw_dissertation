This article examines two early twentieth-century South African poems, Roy Campbell's The Flaming Terrapin (1924) and Herbert Dhlomo's Valley of a Thousand Hills: A Poem (1942), arguing that both can be identified as 'brief epic', a form crucial to modernism. While both are post-Romantic, the two poets engage with the form in different ways: Dhlomo's is Wordsworthian, while Campbell's tends to the neo-Miltonic and is part of early modernism's re-discovery of myth. As regards the communal energy of epic, Dhlomo's poem is national in its implications, while Campbell's is mundane and individualistic. Yet the co-incidence of form and mode, as well as the poets' historical contiguity, suggest that both may be read as contributing to South African literature as a coherent order. Modernity and South African Epic The theory and practice of epic in the black South African imaginary and in oral performance is controversial. The genre overlaps with oral historical narrative but is clearly distinguished from it. Praise poetry achieves the heroic dimensions of epic but subsumes narrative in allusion, while epic tends to submit eulogy to the demands of a single unifying narrative. In at least one line of argument, epic is not indigenous to South Africa: rather, 'eulogy is primary (in the sense of original) in Africa and epic secondary, the product of cultural contact with Islamic or European civilizations'. Hence black literary epic has only developed as a result of contact 'with a Western system of education',1 but has found a wide range of manifestations in English in, for example, the work of Plaatje, Kunene, Madingoane and Serote. Perhaps one reason for the comparative paucity, as some scholars understand it, of epic poetry in Southern Africa is that indigenous black history has not, to a sufficient degree, generated the imperial or state-making energy that can drive the epic poet. Shaka is probably the first figure to spring to mind as 'epic hero' for many South Africans. White South African writing in English has not contributed substantially to the tradition: although there is an imperial and jingoistic epic strain in South African settler writing in English, from G.W.

Epic is not only a verse form and the poet can be his or her own hero, from Dante's re-writing of the epic as a personal spiritual quest to Wordsworth's account of 'the growth of a poet's mind'. In this article I examine two long poems by South African writers. Literary epics on the scale of Paradise Lost are rare, but Paradise Regained as a 'brief epic' offers a canonical model for modernity and I suggest that both Roy Campbell's The Flaming Terrapin (1924) and Herbert Dhlomo's Valley of a Thousand Hills (1942), two poems crucial to the modernist turn in South African writing, are of this form. In 1925, The Flaming Terrapin was formally admitted to an emergent canon when Manfred Nathan wrote, in South African Literature, that the publication of Campbell's 'poem of genuine inspiration and much promise' enabled him to close his chapter on poetry 'on a note of hope, inspired by the promise of youth ... the beauty of his verse (even if it betrays inexperience and occasional blemishes) bids fair for the future of South African poetry'.3 Roy Campbell (1901-1957) has been a central, if controversial, figure in South African English literature ever since The Flaming Terrapin's publication. Herbert Dhlomo (1903-1956) was Campbell's very close contemporary. Both were born and educated in Natal, and both, as poets, looked back to, and forward from, Romanticism. There may have been a common starting-point in school-day encounters with Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats: Campbell at the Durban High School and Dhlomo at the Amanzimtoti Training Institute (Adams [missionary] College). These common debts are traceable throughout the works of both writers. Dhlomo continued his education independently, in the Carnegie Library in Germiston and in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, whereas Campbell continued his in private reading in Oxford, developing his poetic voice in contact with the symbolist descendants of Romanticism and the French tradition from Hugo to Rimbaud. When he first arrived in England in 1919, Campbell's nickname was 'Zulu'; he maintained a real, if sentimental, interest in African culture, and may even have been influenced by black South African writers like Plaatje.4 In later life, he could write privately of the Zulu with sympathy5 and respect,6 while being critical of white complacency and 2 Stow's two epics are: 'The Settlers', a long poem in manuscript in the National Library in Cape Town, and The Native Races of South Africa: A History of the Intrusion of the Hottentots and the Bantu into the Hunting Grounds of the Bushmen, the Aborigines of the Country, G.M.

Voss, 'Roy Campbell's "The Zulu Girl": Context and Tradition of a South African Poem', English in Africa, 15,2 (October 1988), pp. 1 -11, where I argue that Campbell probably knew and used Sol Plaatje's Native Life in South Africa (1916). 5 A sympathetic identification with the Zulu - also present, together with settler apprehension, in 'The Zulu Girl' - is suggested by 'Si Kulu LezTsiswe' [Great Must be this People], under which title Campbell translated some lines 'from the Zulu War-Song during the 1906 Rebellion'. See MS in Killie Campbell Collections, University of KwaZulu-Natal, KCM 25943, File No. RCB 13. Campbell probably made his translation from the Zulu text transcribed by James Stuart in A History of the Zulu Rebellion of 1906 and of Dinuzulu 's Arrest, Trial and Expatriation (London, Macmillan, 1913), p. 117. (Thanks to Jeff Guy for this reference.) 6 See Johannesburg Public Library, Strange Collection, 5 Pam 572(653) Cam (1926), for notes Campbell prepared on the Zulu for Anna von Schubert, where he writes of their triumphant sense of humour and their art of conversation, 'always indulged in as a rite or ceremony ... I have heard conversations among young Zulus which were comparable in delicacy to some of the Idylls of Theocritus'. He also quotes some superstitions, legends and jokes. See also R.

In the last decade of their lives, the two poets' work appeared together in Macnab and Gulston's South African Poetry: A New Anthology (1948), edited and printed in Durban.8 Dhlomo's earliest poems were welcomed by Jordan Ngubane as 'a new phase in the development of Zulu literature',9 and Dhlomo is the subject of an exemplary biography, The New African, by Tim Couzens, but I am not sure that, as a poet, Dhlomo has been as unequivocally admitted to South African (English) literature as has Roy Campbell. There is no Dhlomo, for example, in Michael Chapman's The New Century of South African Poetry, although Dhlomo's work is read with sympathy and insight in the same author's Southern African Literatures.10 In this article I have in mind the unity of South African literature, as an order, like the new South Africa (and equally imaginary), to which all may have access, and I approach the topic in a comparison of two poems by Campbell and Dhlomo: The Flaming Terrapin (1923) and Valley of a Thousand Hills: A Poem (1941). This gap of nearly 20 years means that Campbell was a very young man when his poem was published, whereas Dhlomo was nearly 40 when he published his major poetic work, which can be read as a kind of summation of his oeuvre, as The Flaming Terrapin became for Campbell a kind of manifesto.11 Campbell's poem was written in the immediate aftermath of the First World War, Dhlomo's in the first years of the Second. Each poem embodies both its historical moment and its author's ambition. The point of this comparison is that the two poems are of the same kind: they enter literature's order of words in the same genre, the 'brief epic', which is an important form for modernism.12 David Attwell13 has recently examined the shift from lyric to epic in the work of the Soweto Poets, especially Mongane Serote. In Serote this is a formal progression from 7 In 1926 in a letter from Natal to his friend and patron C.J. Sibbett in Cape Town (National Library of South Africa, Cape Town, MSB 1(1-112), Box No. 1, Correspondence: Letter no. 28:1), Campbell writes of 'my book on the native mind' as if such a volume is soon to appear. (Plaatje uses the phrase 'the back of the native mind' in the preface to Mhudi of 1930 [Johannesburg, Quagga, 1975, p. i] but the phrase seems to have been common in South African debate during the 1920s and 1930s.) Campbell describes his book, which he has sent to Sir James Frazer and L?vy-Bruhl, as a scientific treatise, concerned only with psychology. He is critical of British colonisation, as opposed to Roman, and of white South African attitudes and policies: the complacent assumption that whites hold all the economic and political initiative, the artificial restriction and retardation of blacks, and the fact that so few whites 'can speak a single native language ... The obvious thing is to reform native education'. Despite all this, Campbell still uses the term 'nigger' and refers to Britain as 'home'. Another letter to Sibbett, also of 1926, suggests that 'The Pitso' (Sotho for 'a traditional gathering or conference': Dictionary of South African English, [Cape Town, Oxford University Press, 1998] may have been an early version of, or name for, The Wayzgoose. 8 But published in London by C.A.

Chapman, Southern African Literatures (Johannesburg, Ad. Donker, 1996) and The New Century of South African Poetry (Johannesburg and Cape Town, Ad. Donker, 2002). 11 Yet Valley of a Thousand Hills is amongst Dhlomo's earliest published poems: H.I.E. Dhlomo, Collected Works, ed. N.W. Visser and T. Couzens (Johannesburg, Ravan, 1985), p. 290. 12 My theoretical framework relies heavily on Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism [1957] (New York, Atheneum, 1968) and Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake [1957] (Boston, Beacon, 1967). I quote The Flaming Terrapin from Volume I of Campbell's Collected Works, and Valley of a Thousand Hills from the first edition (Durban, Knox, 1942), with some reference to the Collected Works. 13 Rewriting Modernity: Studies in Black South African Literary History (Scottsville, University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2005).</page><page sequence="4">452 Journal of Southern African Studies the 'overheard utterance' of even the modernist lyric 'towards attempts to speak in a representative voice, with selfhood re-contextualised through political struggle and national formation', in longer works of allegorical or symbolic narrative. The moment is historical, a response to and participation in the political energy of the years leading up to the Soweto revolt. But the shift from minor (lyric/pastoral) to major (epic) is an archetypal trajectory of the poetic career, the assumption of a communal and public voice for longer, more encyclopaedic forms. Valley of a Thousand Hills: A Poem makes H.I.E. Dhlomo in this respect a predecessor of Serote. Citing Bakhtin's privileging of the novel over epic as the medium of the present, Attwell observes that the Soweto Poetry's attempt 'to associate epic discourse with the ongoing production of modernity' may issue in 'an epic of futurity'}5 Dhlomo's poem is just such an attempt and issues in just such a vision. This apocalyptic strain, the presentation of history under the guise of prophecy, is a feature of epic: the politics of the 1940s meant that Dhlomo's poem had to be prophetic. My argument here is that both The Flaming Terrapin and Valley of a Thousand Hills are re-inscriptions of modernity, but Dhlomo's is a national epic, while Campbell's is mundane, an attempt to transcend or avoid the national. Campbell and The Flaming Terrapin The critical consensus on The Flaming Terrapin is reflected by Armando Pajalich, one of the few critics to give the poem detailed attention: it is both a 'great poem' and a 'hybrid pastiche'. It generates a 'rich and luxurious density' but delivers a 'banal morale [for 'moral'?] in conformity with Romantic tradition'.16 D.J. Opperman, probably Campbell's most profound South African reader, found the creative principle of Campbell's verse in 'drif en oordrywing' (passion and exaggeration) but noted: Deur die drif en oordrywing, deur die dinamiese spel aan die oppervlakte van die vers, die oorlading van beeide wat 'n mens oorrompel, die klankmomentum wat 'n mens meevoer, komjy skaars agter hoe min denke en diepte, hoe intellektueel skraal hierdie verskuns is.11 (Because of the passion and exaggeration, the dynamic play on the surface of the verse, the overload of images which takes the reader by storm, the momentum of sound which carries us along, one hardly notices how little thought and depth there is, how intellectually meagre this poetry is.) David Wright called it a 'long and rambling poem ... a hyperbolic conglomerate of Byron, Shelley and Keats ... Its rhythms and imagery seem turgid and confused: there is a noticeable repetitiousness of effect'.18 A review in The Adelphi acknowledged Campbell's 14 Attwell, Rewriting, p. 144, quoting Frye, Anatomy, p. 249. Frye' s definition of the poetry of personal utterance itself derives from J.S. Mill, Dissertations and Discussions (1859) (London, Routledge; New York, Dutton, 1905), p. 101. Mill devised it not to distinguish between one kind of poetry and another, but between poetry and eloquence: 'Poetry and eloquence are both alike expression or utterance of feeling. But if we may be excused the antithesis, we should say that eloquence is heard, poetry is overheard'. Mill's is a post-Romantic dichotomy. Attwell, Rewriting, p. 145, argues further that 'The lyric poem has as its origin in early modernity the sonnet, which is quintessentially the performance of the individualist, the exhibitionist, the courtier, the lover'. But the Renaissance sonnet is an eminently 'eloquent' (rhetorical) form and mode, not completely distinguished in Mill's aphorism. 15 Attwell, Rewriting, pp. 159, 167. 16 A.

Everything and nothing'.19 Campbell described his poem as a 'symbolic vision of the salvation of civilization' .20 And Armando Pajalich offers a number of suggestions for the meta-theme of the poem: 'the exhilaration felt before artistic creation and creation in general ... the possibility of writing again in the grand style of tradition ... That poetry was neither dead nor destined to remain arid and nerveless, and that there was indeed a way out of the Modernists' fear of romantic bombast and decorativism'.21 Campbell's own more positive version of this is his acknowledgement of the influence on The Flaming Terrapin of the 'very beautiful Zulu language, a little on the bombastic side and highly adorned'.22 David Wright's most pointed recognition is that The Flaming Terrapin has a narrative. Taken together with The Adelphi reviewer's encyclopaedic observation of 'what the poem is about. Everything and nothing ... ', the narrative enables us to identify the form of the poem as epic, in this case 'brief epic' or 'miniature epic', which, Northrop Frye observed, becomes in modern times, 'a very common form: the later poems of Eliot, of Edith Sitwell, and many cantos of Pound belong to it'.23 The Flaming Terrapin was first published in 1924: in the decade of The Waste Land, Ulysses and Yeats' Later Poems (1922), of Mein Kampf and Kangaroo (1923), of the first publication of Billy Budd (1924). Its era is the Jazz Age, the age of Josephine Baker and Roger Fry, and Campbell's narrative is itself part of the spoils of modernism's re-discovery of myth, European and exotic: Native American, for example. In one creation story, of the Iroquois, 'the Great Tortoise carried America, the Great island, or Mother Earth on his shell'.24 In another, the earth, made of mud or clay from primal waters, is sometimes 'formed on the turtle's back'. In a flood-myth 'The hero ... is a beneficent animal, the Great Turtle'.25 The turtle features among the avatars of Vishnu. In traditions of the east, the poet told his parents, the tortoise was a talisman for 'strength, longevity, endurance and courage' and an emblem of the universe, 'the dome representing the heavens and the body ... the earth'.26 Campbell yokes such stories to the Genesis account, and he may also have had other resources to draw on: the Mesopotamian story of Gilgamesh or an African myth.27 Campbell's creature is 'flaming' in the sense of fiery, brilliant, profane, but also 'flamboyant', a term that distinguishes one of the American species of terrapin. The Flaming Terrapin is in six (a factor of the epic number 12) parts. Part One opens, in a way that recalls The Prelude, on an image of creativity, here of the stirrings of 'Maternal Earth', which breeds 'wild harmonies of song' so that 'every stone that lines my lonely way [... ] Seems on the point of rising up to sing'. In a brief Eliotesque moment ('"Life is a dusty corridor" I say, "Shut at both ends'"), the poet recalls how often he has lost 'this fervent mood', to which he is recalled by the voice of 'Old Ocean'. The poet claims his power to see 'This sudden strength which catches up men's souls', appearing to him 'in its true self as 19 Quoted in Ad.

The Terrapin is the very energy of life itself, whose voice has roused dust to thought and been the calling of heroes, from Bellerophon, The dandy of the prairies', to Samson and, on the eve of the Flood, this was the voice that called Noah to his 'fierce exertion'. Part Two continues the poem's central narrative of the flood. As Noah and his sons fell trees and shape the timbers of the Ark, the Phoenix rises, 'a signal of alarm ... To the scared nations', who flee, with 'savage tribesmen' and 'Cannibal kings' before the deluge. Night falls and the Ark is launched. Noah lodges his anchor in the shell of the surfacing Terrapin, 'the joyous pilot' who hauls the Ark 'free From the dead earth to dare the living sea'. The Ark's voyage is partly fantastic, partly plottable, always symbolic: 'fiery Coloradoes ... unimagined Congoes ... Down the black Amazon ... Round the spiked islands' and 'where the Cyclops herds the mastodon'. The course seems to be westward across the Atlantic, southward down the east coast of South America and 'Round the stark Horn', at which point the Ark runs into hurricanes, while the sailors, on whom the poet calls in vain, 'lie and dream', passing beneath the Southern Cross, 'through the shadows of the Southern floe' and by 'The wild Antarctic lights'. ('Noah's Dove' is a constellation of the southern sky, and 'Noah's Ark' one formation of the Aurora Australis.) The Ark continues to drift, through the gloom of the weather and the confusion of its crew, until it reaches, in Part Three, 'A nameless cape', which may be the Cape of Storms, but is also within earshot of Erebus and Lofodens, at a point from which are audible the groans of 'The souls of Nations', over-run by Anarchy. At this nadir of the action the sailors, inspired by 'their stormy pilot' the Terrapin, rouse themselves 'To mend the swamping havoc of the Rood'. In a passage which may reflect Campbell's sense of Europe ravaged by war, the 'sooty Fiend' has infected the 'drowning earth' with Mediocrity, Plutocracy, Patriotism, Contentment and Corruption. Amphion, the figure of poetry itself, has become 'A merry piper', in the service of war and industry, but the poet calls on 'Youth of the world' to witness the Ark rolling home. In the invocation to Part Four, which recalls the opening of Book VII of Paradise Lost, Campbell sees 'The Kraken, Time' and makes his claim to 'prophetic visions'. In the name of his 'Muse of the Berg', he calls on those who have been 'Nourished on sunlight' to 'Salute ... the advent of the Ark!' Having successfully negotiated 'the syrens', the Ark is greeted by new signals, 'the rolling whales' and the Albatross appearing with the dawn, when Leviathan rises from the deep to prophesy doom to Corruption and the triumph of Noah and his sons. The Ark lands on 'the far, the promised shore' and the Terrapin sets off 'Over far continents', replacing havoc with spring as he proceeds, toppling the Devil and the damned. The dead rise and the dawn of a new age breaks. Part Five is given to re-creation, the release of the animals from the Ark: creation re visioned in African terms. The connection between earth and heaven is re-established by the descent of 'The topsy-turvy horsemen [... ] The angel cowboys'. Recalling aspects of Books VII and XI of Paradise Lost, the restoration of the earth is signalled in Part Six by the appearance of 'The Rainbow' at which moment 'the Earth meets the Sun', whose union re-generates the world. The Terrapin sounds, sending his vigour through all creation, seen again in African terms, up to its apogee, Man. The natural cycle resumes. Noah stands 'High on the top of Ararat, alone', gazing 'Over far Edens', but he is 'the axle of the wheel, the pole Round which the galaxies and systems roll', and in a lyrical coda the poet identifies himself with Noah: Pass world: I am the dreamer that remains, The Man, clear-cut against the last horizon.</page><page sequence="7">Campbell, Dhlomo and the 'Brief Epic' 455 While it may still be true that 'Campbell's poem does not primarily build up a story', this summary shows that it does have a narrative line, awkwardly proportioned perhaps, but clearly readable, with at least sufficient coherence to bear out Campbell's few expository hints at its theme: the civilisation of which he felt himself to be a part, cut back by war and corrupted by complacency, is to be revived by its outriders: the north by the south, the old by the young, the central by the peripheral, the industrial by the pastoral, the mechanical by the equestrian. Rowland Smith acknowledges the 'mythical plot', which Campbell regarded as integral to the whole poem, and 'the bold confidence of the regenerative moral', but seems to accept the view of the Times Literary Supplement review which he quotes: 'a piecing together of diverse fragments sustained by a loose general argument' of 'na?ve inconsequence'. This is to argue from an issue-centred aesthetic, to miss the point of Campbell's effort. The originality of Campbell's poem is distinct from its novelty: it was simply not trying to do what the TLS was implicitly comparing it with. Campbell wrote to his parents that he had 'tried to develop its moral issues in a clearer manner and to get them into direct rhythm with the progress of the poem'. That last phrase is crucial: 'the progress of the poem' develops a momentum of its own, only partly related to even Campbell's own expository intentions: ... with the deluge as symbolizing the war and its subsequent hopelessness, I have represented in the Noah family, the survival of the fittest, and tried to describe the manner in which they won through the terrors of the storm and eventually colonized the earth. The Terrapin is the symbol for masculine energy.29 Campbell was often to return to this rhetoric, but The Flaming Terrapin does not bear it out: 'the progress of the poem' does not deliver Noah's story as 'the survival of the fittest', his achievement as the colonisation of the earth, or the Terrapin as 'the symbol for masculine energy'. Once Campbell commits himself to his mythic narrative, he takes on the 'cyclic vision in poetry ... the true epic ... a drama of creation, struggle, redemption and restoration'.30 Misread, for content, this will often yield a banal morality or 'naive inconsequence' : however, 'Literature may have life, reality, experience, nature, imaginative truth, social conditions, or what you will for its content', but literature itself is not made out of these things. Poetry can only be made out of other poems'.31 Perhaps it was Campbell's own na?vet?, his own inconsequence, his alienation from the issues that consumed his contemporaries, that enabled him to engage with 'the greatness of the theme itself'.32 Moreover, Campbell adds to the intellectual resonance of his poem a colouring that is both characteristic of the poet and very much of its time. Deriving from Lucretius and Nietzsche, this is the creative evolution and revolutionary materialism espoused by John Davidson, a poet much admired by Campbell.33 The Flaming Terrapin is a brief epic, rather than merely a long poem, and designed to instruct what the poet understands to be his community in its own traditions 'presented in terms of "Giant forms", beings at once human and divine, who are called ... "heroes" in the historical' context,34 to which Campbell assimilates Noah, the Angel Cowboys, Shaka and, implicitly, himself. Campbell later wrote that in The Flaming Terrapin could be read 'the backwash' of his sea voyage from South Africa to Britain and 'the chunks of ore stolen from 28 Pajalich, 'The Influence of Vorticism', pp. 22-3. 29 R.

(I soon bought them all back.)'. As a brief epic, the form of The Flaming Terrapin is that of Paradise Regained, but its narrative substance comes from Books XI and XII of Paradise Lost, with some reference to Book VII. The last two of the six visions of Book XI tell the story of the Flood, Noah and the Rainbow, but Milton's lineage of embodiments of 'that Just Man', from Abdiel to Christ, is replaced by Campbell's sequence of pioneers, cowboys and dandies. Similarly, Campbell's restoration of Nature and dismissal of Nations gives a secular, but comparable, trajectory to the narrative: Milton's Book XII moves from the dispossession, by Nimrod, of 'Concord and law of Nature from the Earth' through the law of Nations, to the evangelisation of the Nations by the Apostles, who 'speak all tongues'. This is a first impulse of Campbell's trans-national allegiance to what he was to call the Equestrian Nation, comparable to Derek Walcott's creed, 'my only nation is imagination'. Campbell was in Oxford for the year of the brief boom which followed the First World War, and his ideology makes an interesting contrast with that of Vera Brittain, his slightly older contemporary, one of the editors of Oxford Poetry 1919, in which Campbell published two poems. When 'Gigue Macabre', one of the South African's first published poems appeared, in the Oxford Chronicle in January 1920, it was paired with Brittain's 'The Lost Years', a bitter and disillusioned retrospect on the First World War, during which she had seen service as a nurse in France. She returned to Oxford after the war, with a suspicion, as she wrote in Testament of Youth, that her 'generation had been deceived, its young courage cynically exploited, its idealism betrayed'. Coming to terms with an initial 'sense of isolation in an alien peace-time world', Brittain applied herself to understanding the disaster, and how she and her contemporaries had been 'used, hypnotized and slaughtered'. Campbell had not served in the war, but in The Flaming Terrapin (and 'Hialmar' from Adamastor) he expressed a comparable sense of a generation betrayed, and like Brittain he was to search for the means and the moment of renewal. With Brittain, Campbell seems to have shared another hard lesson of the war. Having grown up with the belief that 'life was individual, one's own affair', Brittain came to acknowledge 'the terrible truth ... that no life is really private, or isolated, or self-sufficient'. Her response was to follow the faint but encouraging idea that 'people will count only in so far as they realise their background and help to create and to change it', which she sought to do by 'association with the group that accepted internationalism as a creed'.36 Brittain went on to support the League of Nations, which Campbell rejected, re-asserting individualism, fashioning himself as isolato, and embracing the imaginative internationalism of the gipsy, the dandy, the vaquero. Like a Blake prophecy, The Flaming Terrapin is 'an imaginative mechanism designed to fight the machine age',37 as in its appropriation of industrial imagery to the Terrapin itself. Its land- and seascape of heights, depths and expanses, of verticals and horizontals, is a modernist grid re-vitalised and re-populated with the surviving possibilities of the created world. Perhaps in Campbell's youthful, and still pagan, epic project, 'to Restore what the Ancients call'd the Golden Age' (in Blake's words) or to find that 'Paradise, and groves Elysian, Fortunate Fields' are 'A simple produce of the common day' (in Wordsworth's), there is something individually African: ... the divergence of views as to what constitutes heaven and/or paradise between the African and the European is related to the social attitudes towards the earth. One regards the earth as a 35 Campbell, Collected Works, ffl, p. 287. 36 V.

Campbell, explicitly engaging with the great archetypes of flood and Eden, returned to the continuous narrative form of the epic at a time when the post-Romantic poets of modernism were packing their encyclopaedic charge into 'the central episodic theme ... of the pure but transient moment, Rimbaud's Illuminations, Joyce's epiphany, the Augenblick of modern German thought, and the kind of non-didactic revelation implied in such terms as symbolisme and imagism' ,39 Yet the narrative is an accumulation of embedded epiphanies, including the more conventional epic moments of invocation and apostrophe, given connective tissue by the repetition of 'soul', 'mind' and 'thought'. The Flaming Terrapin attempts to be both continuous and encyclopaedic, and bears no trace of 'the ironic mode ... rationalized by critical theories of the essential discontinuity of poetry'.40 Within a decade of the earliest Cantos and The Waste Land, Campbell eschewed the radical technique of poetry that is both encyclopaedic and discontinuous, and held on to his metronome. The Flaming Terrapin, as is to be expected of a young man's poem, is full of echoes, newly-discovered tricks, and memories. Campbell's m?tonymie use of plural toponyms ('Coloradoes', 'Congoes') recalls Rimbaud's 'd'incroyables Florides' in Le Bateau Ivre, the echo of which is strong in Part Two, where Campbell has 'panthers' eyes', 'phosphorescent flowers' and 'gleaming serpents', rehearsing 'des phosphores chanteurs', 'panth?res' and 'les serpents g?ants'. The vigour of Campbell's Terrapin is conjured by Rimbaud's 'o future vigeur'.41 Behind this more recent discovery of the French poet, Campbell sensed in The Flaming Terrapin that backwash of his voyage to Britain: perhaps the 'spiked islands' recalled 'Going round Agulhas (or the Needles) to the Cape itself ... thrilled by the rugged grandeur and wildness of the scene, and by the size of the waves'.42 And further back still, perhaps the reading of Purves's South African Book of English Verse inspired the Terrapin's 'pillared temple', 'the brazen anvil of his head' and 'brazen shell', which may go back to details of the whale in two stanzas (xxxi and xxxii) of The Progress of the Soul, where Donne has 'his brazen fins' and 'His ribs are pillars'. Campbell's Leviathan in Part Four is like Robert Bridges' 'The Iron Swimmer'. The unsectarian theology of the baboons in The Flaming Terrapin, who inhabit 'the dim cathedral of the peak' and are 'mitred with the moon', but are also 'The gaunt muezzins of the mountain-tops', derives from Campbell's own Bongwi, but also inherits something from Bret Harte's 'The dim Sierras far uplifting Their minarets of snow'.43 Identifying The Flaming Terrapin as 'epic' seems contradictory. However, although the poet was barely 23 years old when his poem was published, it is as true of Campbell as of any poet that 'The moment in which the epic poet finally chooses his subject is the crisis of his life, as Dante and Milton at least show very clearly; and his choice, once made, almost precludes the idea of ever finding another'.44 Campbell made his choice early and thus in a reversal of the conventional poetic career, the episodes of his early epic seem to reappear as lyrics in his later work.

Dhlomo and Valley of a Thousand Hills Although Dhlomo's lyric mode and topographical focus suggest the form of a 'major ode', Tim Couzens argues that Valley of a Thousand Hills 'is one of the major poetic epics in South African literature' and that the poet 'specifically links his poem to the epic', clearly expressing the philosophical and political position Dhlomo had reached, but not fully comprehensible without reference to his personal life. Couzens' comparison with Hart Crane's The Bridge suggests something of Dhlomo's South African modernism.45 The significance of the title of Dhlomo's poem lies only partly in a place on the map - the Valley of the Umgeni which runs from north-west to south-east, north-east of the road between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. In fact, the place is not invoked with great exactitude. Like the title of Campbell's poem it is symbolic - but its symbolism is social and political rather than mundane and philosophical. As Dhlomo writes in Section VI: This beauty's not my own! My home is not My home! I am an outcast in my land. Psychological dislocation finds literary expression in pastoral form, but in political terms carries revolutionary implications. Although both are post-Romantic epic instances, in Northrop Frye's terms Campbell's poem tends more towards the 'fictional', involving 'internal characters apart from the author and his audience', and Dhlomo's to the 'thematic' in which 'internal characters are subordinated to an argument maintained by the author'.46 Dhlomo's narrative is thus more elusive than Campbell's but is nonetheless there. The division of Valley of a Thousand Hills into prologue, seven parts and epilogue does not make a conventional epic numeration. The 'Prologue' in lyric quatrains opens evoking the names of Zululand, the poet's 'dear Fatherland', but identified with the past - the first person mentioned in the poem is Shaka, whose men 'Sang, wrought and fell'. The poet claims epic (Homeric) status for his 'matter': ... we Plumed Trojan Black Bulls, claim a name! For Shaka, now our Jove, more than Sung classic names achieved. In this alignment, who are the Greeks, whose horse is not to be trusted, and who are to be feared although they proffer gifts? Names are invoked for more than the savour of their sound. 'Mfolozi Black ... Mahlabathini'47 and Umkhambathini are precisely locative, but also evoke topography and vegetation. Tnkandhla, Nongoma and Ulundi' recall battles of 1906, 1888 and 1879, in a conspectus of political history that will return to energise the poem. Shaka, identified with the supreme god of the Romans, Troy's descendants, becomes a 'Giant form', an epic hero, 45 Couzens, The New African, pp. 220, 222. 46 Frye, Fearful Symmetry, pp. 365, 367. 47 Couzens, The New African, p. 42, notes that Dhlomo 'wrote that his father "came from" Mahlabathini'. (I thank Adrian Koopman for generous help with Zulu names, beliefs and customs.)</page><page sequence="11">Campbell, Dhlomo and the 'Brief Epic' 459 the status accorded him in Campbell's poem. But Dhlomo identifies also with the wider African past, Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana; with Hannibal, the third-century BC Carthaginian general (and near-conqueror of Rome), and James Aggrey, the twentieth-century West African educationalist and reformer. The poet is aware of this past but cannot articulate or express it - his vision is without co ordinates: 'I see them all, but see not where they be!' The prologue is in fact a prayer for poetic and prophetic power, and in Part I the speaker identifies himself as a poet, calling on abstract values, places and spirits: Give me the words, the depth, the holiness This magic sight to hold imprison, sing. The Valley is invoked as an unreal visionary 'earth-heaven' ; in a sequence of individual lyrics, the poet calls on the pantheon of Zulu gods and heroes. Nomkubulwana, addressed as Nkosazana, is the only daughter of God, the primal symbol of creation,48 a source of energy around whom much of the poem's anguish will revolve, and from whom its resolution will emerge. Mvelinqanga is the supreme creator and Nkulunkulu the first and greatest. The identifying historical names include both 'Mbopha', the head-domestic (induna), who betrayed Shaka to Dingane, his brother, assassin and successor. The roll-call culminates in the chorus of 'Imilozi Voices',49 the creative imagery of which is echoed in the evocation of the messenger of the Gods, Chakijana, who often appeared as Hlakanyana, and whose name was adopted as the praise name of Sekabekhuluma, 'strategist of the Bambatha rebellion'.50 Chakijana is also the architect of 'these mazy slopes'. But the valley is still a retreat from history since perhaps Chakijana too has administered the 'ubukwebezana herb', which robs men of their memory.51 Nonetheless, the beauty of the created world is contrasted with 'Our human arts' of the present: Commercial pantomime, a reaping field For swollen pundits ... crude and dumb before This artless Art, this form-defying form! The natural created world is the Land of the singer and the poet (Praise)! Land of the artist God-enthroned (Praise it)! Land of ancestral Afric's Spirits (Sing)! Land of bold warriors, sages black (Sing it)! In this exchange, which resembles call-and-response of praise-singer and people, this is 'the dear land that gave me birth' and the section continues with an evocation of the past, which praises its strength and distinctive features, but recognises its limitations, 48 Kunene, Anthem, p. xxvi. 49 'ImilozV refers to the whistling sounds made by the 'abalozV, the whistling spirits who hover in the thatch of the huts of certain diviners.

Despite the 'charmed peacefulness' there is 'no rest, Beginning, end or death, but constant birth'. Dhlomo presents tribal values and orders as mute, if they are orientated only towards the past: in a line of characteristically enigmatic syntax, Dhlomo sums up the impotence of a culture directed only towards its own past: 'These visioned lands music dissolves!'. As the section ends, the poet hears a bird whose song, recalling Keats's nightingale as if it were pictured on the Grecian urn, hints at a vision of renewal. In Part II, the vehicle of the poet's inspiration is no longer the bird or the Valley itself, but 'the arum-lily' of his 'native streams', which seems to stand also for love or the beloved. While the poet is painfully separated from purity, love and nature, from any sense of wholeness and unity, Part III returns to the Valley; 'the place where I saw light' is invoked as an image of 'Spiritual purity', from which the poet is now alienated. As in Part II, this 'Love' is a source of both joy and pain. The poet is in a contradictory state of mind; driven, like Wordsworth in the opening of The Prelude ('Was it for this...?') to question the purpose of his origins, he nonetheless sounds the first note of protest and resistance in the poem: I of this world, men of this world, oppose, Betray and fight! With lies, dishonour strike! The poet's pain continues into Part IV, which opens with 'The devil strange in me' raising a fit of self-questioning and self-loathing, threatening cynical rejection of the poetic role: there follows an equally painful lyrical sequence addressed to the 'Lord'. But then comes a crucial moment (at the mid-point of the poem) in which an unidentified voice calls the poet back: Awake! Arise! And see the beauty of The Valley of the Thousand Hills - and live! In a quaintly comic passage, Dhlomo seeks to name the voice: bird, mountain, ant, snail, root of tree, snake, hare? The silent music of the Valley eventually leads him back to the deeper silence of the self, where he hears 'Philosophy of poets gone', inviting the poet into an artistic and creative community whose visionary ethos will 'Appear immoral in immoral spheres'. Ironically, this conventional self-identification with the bardic and prophetic tradition is juxtaposed with a masculinist image of women, which may register the intrusion of Dhlomo's marital difficulties into his epic vision: Frail woman robs me of my poesy! Pure woman shoots my poesy to stars! Release from these painful emotions of shame and frustration comes only in paradoxical transcendence: In space and time, I stood beyond both space And time! Part V recalls the poet to the continuum of history: evoking the Zulu past, in a different spirit from its image in Part I, as a philosophical and ethical critique of the capitalist present of Dhlomo's South Africa in the 1940s, partly by metaphorically figuring the productivity of 'The Tribal State' as mining. The idealised image describes the social form as 'paradise [... ] Republic true! [...] Democracy', as co-operative rather than 'Commercial'; the state is the people's slave rather than their lord, in a land not of 'classes, castes' but of 'guardians, warriors and the rest'. This order is reflected in the sequence of songs that concludes Part V,</page><page sequence="13">Campbell, Dhlomo and the 'Brief Epic' 461 in which the various voices of tribal society, child, youth and age, are heard individually and in harmony. This vision of the past enables the poet to face 'The Present State', as Part VI is called in the Collected Works. Here, the poet sees 'tortured visions of The race': from the worship of 'Wealth and Power and Blood' he sees 'a future tragic with Greed's ways'. Three voices of 'this dark present' answer the three songs of 'the Tribal state'. The first issues in 'A groaning wail', which laments the passing of the 'native Soul'. The second voice (perhaps the T of the poet), 'Unsatisfied with tones all calm with hope', speaks in 'more poignant music' of alienation and loss of freedom, ending on a clear note of protest and resistance: My country's not my own, - so will I fight! My mind is made: I will yet strike for Right. In this context 'strike' is a loaded word: the African Mineworkers' Union was founded in 1941, in the midst of Johannesburg bus boycotts, which lasted throughout the years of the Second World War. The third voice is 'still discontent' and speaks in dignity and sweetness, yet its 'screech of parlance modern, blunt and sharp!' turns the prediction of the previous voice (T will yet strike for right') into an injunction 'Let's rise and strike for right', so that the section ends with a call to instant action, which has regained 'the native Soul' in a contemporary ideological idiom. Section VII offers a vision in which 'Ancestral Spirits rise' and spring returns, in the burgeoning of seed and bird: this 'ever-blooming Soul' is 'our Soul' and generates a prophetic vision of peace, in which the Valley itself sings 'Song of the Dawn'. The poet identifies the creative principle with his own mother and thus takes his place in the succession of bards and warriors. In the Epilogue the poet prays for re-creation - 'Create again!' - leaving to the Creator the realisation of his vision: 'The Beauty that this day my eyes have seen'. Couzens observes justly that this conclusion echoes Julia Ward Howe's 'Battle Hymn of the Republic', but, for the Christian Dhlomo it must also have recalled the Nunc Dimitas: '... mine eyes have seen thy salvation'.52 This account of the sequence of Valley of a Thousand Hills suggests that its model is Wordsworth rather than Milton, embodying the imagination in memory and vision rather than narrative. Yet this 'long autobiographical poem' manages 'a fine mixture of personal pain and the misery around',53 and in other ways achieves the encyclopaedic function that 'epic' would require. In the manner of the praise-singer, Dhlomo invokes historical figures as epic heroes, without figuring them in narrative, but seeks other ways in which to give voice to a multiplicity of interests, reflected not only in the lyric sequences, but in the prosodie variety of the poem. Tim Couzens gives a moving account of the personal crisis that led up to Dhlomo's writing of the Valley of a Thousand Hills: the loss of his job at the Carnegie Library, the break-up of his marriage and the move from Johannesburg to Durban.54 This was accompanied by a growing resentment of the powerlessness to which the South African order seemed to reduce him, and so many like him. Dhlomo's shift from 'liberal' to 'radical' was achieved in the context of the accelerating militancy of black resistance. The narrative of Dhlomo's poem is like that of 'Tintern Abbey' or The Prelude. In response to a crisis, both emotional and social, the poet returns from the ironic and unsympathetic world of modernity to the locus amoenus of his 'native vale'. There he 52 Couzens, The New African, p. 222. Here again there may be a parallel with Campbell, who wrote to his Presbyterian parents: 'The whole moral of the poem is contained in Christ's words' and quoted Matthew 3:10 and 5:13. (See Pearce, Bloomsbury, p. 50.) Campbell is attempting to reconcile Social Darwinist implications with the Christianity of his youth (and middle age). 53 Ibid., p. 221 54 Ibid., pp. 197-216</page><page sequence="14">462 Journal of Southern African Studies receives refreshment and renewal, re-connecting with the archetypes of his inspiration, and achieving the re-creation that is his poem. Valley of a Thousand Hills thus incorporates both a Wordsworthian narrative of individual growth and a Blakean moment of illumination.55 But the poem itself has re-aligned the archetypes, who have become not simply Zulu, but African; not tribal but national. And Dhlomo has inscribed himself into the lineage of heroes, which begins with Shaka, by identifying himself as poet with the 'miners': But who are these who toil and sweat in song? Who bent and thin rise high like giant forms? Not slaves are these nor blind. They stoop thought-bent! Rare diggers they! W^ho toil without a lord; Their overseer but the wealth they seek. They mine for ore surpassing all gold hoards; They set a tree to feed those yet unborn... Who mines the past the future makes secure. The poet will 'dig the Past' to connect with those who 'Forever strove and struck, themselves to wrench From domination foreign', figures from the tribal past aligned with those who 'rise and strike for right', the workers, with whom the poet identifies, even as he does with the 'band Of bards of old'.56 This means that, imaginatively at least, Dhlomo has found, for the personal distress of marital break-up, emotional disorder and virtual homelessness, an economic, social and political re-orientation. Like The Flaming Terrapin, Valley of a Thousand Hills begins and ends with the individual poet and his inspiration. Whereas Campbell claims to answer the call of 'Old Ocean', Dhlomo responds to 'men and places' which he knows and has named but which speak to him 'out of Eternity'. Remembering that one is a poem of youth and the other of maturity, we can see an exemplary contrast in their two modes of self-figuration: Campbell claimed to have found his role early in life: 'I became a d?racin? once and for all though I have never been a r?volt? and have always lived stirrup-high above the ground'.57 In The Flaming Terrapin he takes the persona of the cowboy in a Romantic self-dramatisation as isolato, while Dhlomo attempts both to express the difficult emotions of bourgeois economic life and to identify with a popular consciousness, figuring the proletariat significantly as 'miners'. Both poets reveal a gendered, masculinist imagination, a feature in which European and African attitudes seem to converge. In the context of Dhlomo's life and work as a whole, Valley of a Thousand Hills occupies a crucial place. In 1936, he had published The Girl Who Killed to Save (Nongqause the Liberator), a tragic interpretation of the Xhosa cattle-killing of 1856, which argues, nonetheless, and in the view of Dhlomo's editors, perhaps naively, 'that progress is a good thing, that even the Cattle-Killing was beneficial since it destroyed tribalism and brought people into a modern age'.58 While it is possible to read this play as something other than 'a piece of mission literature produced for and published by a mission press',59 one can accept that Valley of a Thousand Hills reflects Dhlomo's disillusionment with 'progress' and his espousal of a prouder and more independent view of black culture, an attitude that may align him with Black Consciousness, and which registers in the difference between the poem's two images of the tribal past, in Parts I and V. This change is more pronounced in the version of the poem in Collected Works than in the 1942 version. In Part I, Dhlomo develops the image 55 Dhlomo closely fits Frye's bill for the 'Romantic poet'.

Nkulunkulu allows uMlingi's creatures to stand, but makes the Africans a distinct people and compensates men with the gift of ubuntu.60 The image of the tribal past is further qualified in Part IV: 'Cattle - the curse and power of tribal life'. And the politics of Part VI is radicalised: 'We'll strike and take! if others will not give!' Coleridge contrasted the alternatives open to the epic poet in a way that seems to anticipate Campbell and Dhlomo: In my judgment, an epic poem must either be national or mundane. As to Arthur, you could not by any means make a poem on him national to Englishmen. Milton saw this, and with a judgment at least equal to his genius, took a mundane theme - one common to all mankind. His Adam and Eve are all men and women inclusively.61 It is a question whether a national epic was possible for any South African poet, in 1924 or 1942, but given the polarities, Campbell moved towards the mundane and Dhlomo towards the national. Even in this respect these two poets represent two types of the South African writer, the diasporado (to coin a term) and the indig?ne. Both poets come late in their traditions (or tradition), and if we can argue for the emergence of a South African tradition, we could say that each has to deal, Dhlomo more explicitly perhaps than Campbell, with his relation to the society of his time. And Dhlomo seems also more conscious of the implications of his work for his cultural tradition, finding a more prominent place in his vision for his personal situation.62 However, insofar as the post-Romantic provides a context for these poets, 'Nature', the created world, means something real and particular, something ecological, to both, an idea developed by B.W. Vilakazi.63 Whereas the critical consensus on The Flaming Terrapin suggests that form overwhelms content, the reverse is true for Valley of a Thousand Hills, criticism of which tends to express admiration for its sentiments and embarrassment for its diction. Michael Chapman finds that 'sub-romantic clich?s', the commonplaces of Romantic poetic diction, sit awkwardly alongside Dhlomo's calls to action, so that the poem's 'other-worldliness', which settles 'for the consolations of the anthropomorphic vision' seems to exclude Dhlomo from modernism.64 Couzens and Visser outline the 'constraints and influences which often made [Dhlomo's] language seem stilted, artificial, even pompous'.65 Seeking admission to an English-speaking audience, Dhlomo was hampered by elitist literary attitudes and the canonisation of Romantic and Victorian anthology pieces in mission education. This all suggests that Dhlomo took over not only his langue but also his parole ready-made. Dhlomo does occasionally use what sounds like outdated vocabulary and word order, as in these lines from the Prologue: To hear but your sweet sound is music grand! I see them all, but see not where they be! 60 Dhlomo, Collected Works, pp. 297-8. 'Mlingi' may be a personification rather than a specific person: from the verb 'ukulinga: to perform magic, to do tricks', hence 'magician, conjuror ... certainly someone who can make strange things happen' (Adrian Koopman, personal correspondence). The epilogue's prayer for re-creation avoids uMlingi's blasphemous challenge. 61 S.T.

Perhaps there is always something both anthropomorphic and otherworldly in metaphor. We should read Dhlomo for what he includes, not what he excludes, since Dhlomo achieved what his editors call 'a peculiar verbal style'66 partly by incorporating into the action of his poem an engagement with poetic diction itself, in a way that recalls Campbell. The effect is that Dhlomo's best poetic effects are often achievements of perspective which for some readers may recall Blake: in Part IV A snail jogs quiet by, all peaceful, mute... In peace and sloth a dappled snake parades Its beauty fierce ... was it my ancestor? The Flaming Terrapin makes recurrent use of the exotic reaches of English vocabulary. The cowboy and caballero theme rounds up 'bronco', 'flitches', 'lassos', 'mesa', 'pan', 'papooses', 'rowelled'. From Campbell's wider reading come, for example, 'gurly', 'lupanar', 'nenuphar'. In Part Three, as the stallions of Anarchy pass, 'the gurly sea grew black'. In the ballad of 'Sir Patrick Spens', which John Purves included in The South African Book of English Verse, 'gurly grew the sea'.67 Campbell describes the Horn in Part Two as 'the lupanar of Death', which may recall the 'Tombeaux et lupanars' of Baudelaire's 'Les Deux Bonnes Soeurs\6S Campbell's 'reflected stars That floated there like huge white nenuphars' in Part Four echoes a rhyme from Oliver Wendell Holmes: 'The stream with ... clustering nenuphars Sprinkling its mirrored blue like golden-chaliced stars'.69 Dhlomo's rarer vocabulary is more limited, but comparable and distinctive. This poet finds himself cramped by the 'inefficiency, inaptitude' (IV: 190) of others, the latter suggesting inept, but also unfit, unready, unskilful, unhandy. The implication is of a functional attitude to poetry as a craft pursued in the service of a practicable cause. In traditional society, as described in Part V, 'Fair Hospitage rules king in every home'. The faintly anachronistic term is apt in its suggestion of the office of guest, and the practice of hospitality and lodging. In the Youth Group song life 'kicks This viscid glitter' of love: the embarrassment and frustration of adolescent sexuality. In Part VI '.. .domination foreign' is described as 'shameful gadge', which may be a misprint or derived from Browning for an instrument of torture (OED) or even an ironic abbreviation of 'gadget'. The Collected Works has the more readily readable 'badge'. In the 1942 addition to Part V, Dhlomo used the plausible formation (coinage?) 'lucient': 'Sweet are these dales, These lucient vales!'. The Collected Works has 'luscious'. Dhlomo's dictionary searching-out of the dynamic English word-hoard is different then from Campbell's global modernism: Campbell accepts the meaning with the word, Dhlomo submits the word to his own meanings. In the concluding vision of Valley of a Thousand Hills, which brings together 'Ancestral Spirits', nature, history and individual in 'our soul', there is a line that seems to sum up all the complexities of reading Dhlomo: And verdant plants fingure their way to the crests! 'Verdant' in the sense of a colour may have come to Dhlomo via Spenser, Milton, Cowley, Wesley Cowper or Moore; in the sense of inexperienced or innocent from Byron: both senses apply to the new growth of the spring. 'Fingure' may be Dhlomo's use of a substantive 66 Dhlomo, Collected Works, p. xiv. 67 Purves, The South African Book, p. 76. 68 C. Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du Mal, A. Adam (ed.)

Like Campbell nearly 20 years earlier, but more pragmatically, Dhlomo realised that genuine renewal involves a detachment of consciousness from the stream of history: the 'constant birth' of the past does not offer the re-creation which must follow both flood and revolution. Tradition lives! It lives when and because it is evolutionary. It lives when men and women are free to add to or reject from it. Merely to go back to the past is not tradition. It is death. Past, present and future are not separate.70 During the 1940s, Dhlomo published critical and polemical essays which bear out the more radical political alignment of Valley of a Thousand Hills. 'Masses and the Artist' is the poet's revolutionary appeal to and identification with his people: 'The Masses must share in ... the good things of life ... a partnership in the ownership of production'. And Dhlomo uses a striking image to suggest what is necessary: As long as the fruits of life are not malleated out to reach all and sundry, so long will there be upheavals and wars which are the result of oppression, frustration, despondency. In other words, these chronic explosions are but the tangible and palpable forms of humanity's cry for freedom, for happiness.71 The Second World War was one such explosion, which radicalised and internationalised South African resistance, and in which Dhlomo saw 'the conditions under which great literature thrives ... a time when men discover in their history great heroes whose activities are near enough to have interest and meaning, but remote enough to form subjects of great dispassionately passionate creative literature'. His was an age for the combination of 'the native and the alien, the traditional and the foreign, into something new and beautiful'. The function of the artist is thus not mere propaganda, but to document and sing 'Tribal Heroes, Kings and Gods, our rich mythology, our great and glorious scenery', to comment on current conditions and aspirations. Here, argued Dhlomo, is genuine epic material: 'who will venture to say that our Race struggle is less heroic than that of Troy?'72 Valley measures up to the poet's own expectations. Dhlomo's poetic endeavour was partly a response to the new impetus given to the political struggle by organised African labour. This 'most effective weapon' could be weakened by oppressive legislation, but in the Durban riots of 1949, Dhlomo saw the African 'turning to the weapon of economies'. To the arsenal of African resistance, Dhlomo would add 'the weapon offered by the arts'. African artists 'must speak for the African and inspire him to freedom and greatness. And now is the time to do it'.73 In 1941, the Marxist critic Dora Taylor published, in Trek, a three-part study called 'Unbroken Record', which made clear the frustrations and self-defeat of Campbell's 'equestrian' ideology as it had developed since the publication of The Flaming Terrapin. 70 'Literary Theory and Criticism of H.I.E. Dhlomo', N. Visser and T. Couzens (eds), Special Issue of English in Africa, 4, 2 (September 1977), p. 58. 71 Ibid., p. 61. 'Malleated' was misprinted in the original (Ilanga Lase Natal, 10 April 1943) as 'malleanated'. To malleate is to hammer or beat thin, so as to re-shape: an apt metaphor for the revolutionary change of an economy based on gold. 72 'Literary Theory and Criticism of H.I.E. Dhlomo', pp. 59,62. As in Valley of a Thousand Hills, Dhlomo identifies his people with the Trojans and against the dominant, perhaps imperial, power of ancient Europe. 73 Ibid., pp. 71, 72.</page><page sequence="18">466 Journal of Southern African Studies Taylor diagnosed the poet's career as a fanatic and fantastic attempt to hold on to the vestigial feudal privilege of his colonial youth: Meanwhile one fact is relentlessly clear - the futility of looking backwards to a pre-capitalist era as a solution to the grave problems confronting both the masses and the individual to-day. Where now can the poet turn?74 Taylor also wrote on Dhlomo in Trek: 'Africans Speak', a series of essays on black writers, dismisses Nongqause: the Girl who Killed to Save as a falsification of history in the service of a mission education.75 It is interesting to speculate on what Taylor might have felt about Dhlomo's epic attempt to identify with the working class in Valley of a Thousand Hills. Conclusion How much do Campbell and Dhlomo have in common? Born within a couple of years of each other, dying a year apart (both still only in their 50s), they came from the same province; they were influenced by similar literary traditions, perhaps the same literary tradition, to which they both in turn contributed. Even as South Africans, one black and one white, they are not generally brought together in analysis. But both their historical closeness and their different, yet parallel and analogous, entries into the Western and South African literary traditions, make their work interesting and worth attention. It could be argued that the categories of a theoretical scheme like Frye's are either ahistorical and thus contradict any attempt to situate the two poets historically, or too vague and generalised to make sense of the comparison I have attempted here. But I would argue that an inclusive analysis that is, as far as possible, strictly literary, and historically sensitive, is both necessary and timely for South Africa now. Otherwise we are asked to accept Dhlomo's ideology and reject his poetry, and to do the reverse for Campbell. Tony Voss Department of English, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.
