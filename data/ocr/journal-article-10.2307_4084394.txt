<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man and birds, evolution and behavior.-Andrew J. Meyerriecks. 1972. Indianapolis, Indiana, Pegasus (A Biological Sciences Curriculum Study Book). xi + 209 pp., 48 figs. Cloth. $6.95-.Added to the many slim books introducing portions of the latest in "current concepts" or "foundations" of biology to the undergraduate, we have this attempt to teach of evolution and behavior using only birds as exemplars. The try fails as a result, I think, of two basic difficulties, one of which should be of intrinsic interest to most ornithologists, to wit: As seminal as avian biology has been in both fields of this book's endeavor, Meyerriecks inadvertently demonstrates (in the section on evolution, for example) that the likes of Drosophila, Cepaea, Tribolium, Mus, Danaus, and Anolis simply cannot be excluded from any general coverage of a topic including fitness, competition, mimicry, endemism, reproductive potential, genetic variability, mutation, dispersal, and so forth. Meyerriecks tries and is frequently left with little or nothing for his effort. To cite a simple example: mimicry is discussed (very briefly) using Zone- tailed Hawks vis-a-vis Turkey Vultures-legitimate though a good deal more problematical than is implied, and by speculating that bright plumage in some (edible) bird species mimics the plumage of other (inedible) ones. The latter idea is unsubstantiated so far as I'm aware (where are you butterflies?)-additionally, it seemingly has obviated the possibility of any subsequent discussion of conspicuous plumage and sexual selection, an area where birds would seem to provide the perfect models. For his section on behavior (an entirely different minibook, really) Meyerriecks adopts a different tactic; here he talks only of "Territory," "Bird Communication," and "Brood Parasitism" (his chapter titles). For behavior, then, while we are left with a thin slice of the topical pie, at least we might hope to have a relatively tasty bite or two from it. That we don't by and large points up this book's second failing: It is almost entirely nonanalytical, completely descriptive, and loosely (see the quote below) written. The whole proceeding has a superficial ambience that should leave the average uninitiated reader looking elsewhere than to birds for subsequent action. We do read that avian territoriality may or may not relate to apportioning food resources, maintaining a pair bond, avoiding predators, etc., but we have only the briefest passing reference to the relationship of territory with population size and structure or with habitat quality; group territoriality receives just over a page of description without mention of any possible raison d'etre; for flock alarm calls (p. 161): "[the caller] does not want to be taken as prey by the hawk, yet there is an advantage for the species [my italics] in alerting the others to the source of danger." The idea of altruistic behavior is not considered here or elsewhere. Returning again to the section on evolution we find the going murkier still. By my reckoning one is 64 pages into the book before he finally finds a clear, simple statement integrating variability, heritability, and adaptation, all of which have been dealt with separately and together since the beginning. Early on a couple of atrocious algorithms purport to elucidate artificial and natural selection, but</page><page sequence="2">October 1973] Reviews 927 skip them or you may find yourself attributing the evolutionary process to divine will alone. Evolutionary thinking further receives the disservice of (p. 65): "One way to take advantage of. . resource diversity is to diversify yourself." Bird species are defined adequately according to the standard biological precept, but Meyerriecks' most peculiar example leaves the reader aware that Mourning Doves behave as good species towards both Eastern and Western Meadowlarks but perhaps a bit confused as to what the meadowlarks think of each other (why both meadowlarks, or why the dove?). The corker, for me at least, comes with ecological competition and Gauss' Principle (p. 83): "Or, one species solves the problem, so to speak, by leaving the situation, going elsewhere in an attempt to survive" (are we to envisage an avian hegira or The Chickadees' Trail of Tears?). Several other authors (still notable is A. J. Cain's "Animal species and their evolu- tion") have shown how to treat these or related topics with simultaneous sophisti- cation, brevity, and lucidity; this work falls well beyond their pale. And finally there's a title, man and birds, presumably promising some kind of "relevancy" to those who value their whole-earth catalogs and libraries of Desmond Morris or Jane Goodall. Possibly the anthropomorphic phraseology permeating this book represents an attempt to have the reader view himself as an evolutionary or behavioral microcosm? Even if Meyerriecks' analogies (if that's what they are) may often be apt enough in that context, I doubt whether any self-awareness en- gendered will be more profound than the reader's understanding of the analogous avian phenomena. And such understanding, if based on this book alone, will be woe- fully shallow.-DAVID M. NILES.</page></plain_text>
