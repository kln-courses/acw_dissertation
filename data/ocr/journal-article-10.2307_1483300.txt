<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER CAHN Moses ben Abraham's Chroniques de la Bible For Rachel Wischnitzer In the Royal Library at The Hague, there is a little-known manuscript with illustrations of the prophecies of Daniel, a singular work probably executed in northeastern France or Flanders around the year 1300.1 As will be seen below, it has some interest, albeit tangential, for the study of Jewish art, to which Rachel Wischnitzer has made both pioneering and fundamental contributions. The text of the Hague manuscript is a French paraphrase of the Bible, with special emphasis on the Books of Daniel and Maccabees. The translator and compiler identifies himself and his patron in the prefatory opening passage, which may be translated as follows: "My Lord, Count William of Auvergne, who wanted to have for himself and to know the beginning and the unfolding of the lineages since the creation of the world, as well as the battles which were fought in ancient times, had this book written. And I, Moses, the son of Abraham, the redhead and Jew, applied himself to put this matter into plain French. "2 The work comes to an end with the subscription "Explicit la bible en franchois" written in the hand of the original scribe, followed by the words in a batarde script of the fifteenth century: "selon la descricion veritable de Josephus par forme de chroniques en ce compris lexposition des visions de Daniel le prophete hystoriees destranges figures." The manuscript was formerly in the collection (Ms. 175) of the landsadvocat Jacob Visser, who died in 1804, and was acquired five years later by the Royal Library. Nothing is known of its earlier history. As we learn from Moses ben Abraham himself, the sources of his chronicle were the Bible, Josephus - whose writings are referred to in the opening statement and elsewhere in the text as "la verite de Josephe" - and the Alexander legend. The author's avowed aim to trace the lineages of noble clans and peoples back to their Biblical origins, to recount the struggles of ancient empires and speculate on marvels still to come governs the selection of his material.3 There is no reference to the Creation of the World, and the opening prologue leads without a break of any kind to an enumeration of the descendance of Adam through Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham and laphet, the traditional progenitors of peoples in the Medieval tripartite division of mankind. In this interpreta- tion, the peoples of Europe are held to be descendants of laphet, and those of Gaul in particular, of the first of laphet's seven sons, Gomer.4 Our chronicler, however, says nothing of the Galli, and instead rather boldly makes of Gomer the parent of Francus or Francio, the legendary founder of the Franks: "le premier fils de laphet, Gomer, engendra 1 fils qui ot a nom Francion. Et cil vint en la terre de France. Et par son nom fu apeles France. Et ler terre siet sur le fleuve de Seine."5 It is worth noting that this view of Frankish origins is at variance with the much bruited account of the Trojan legend, enshrined in the Grandes Chroniques de France, which claims that Francio was a son of Hector, who fled westward with his followers after the fall of Troy.6 But the author on the whole stays fairly close to the Biblical narrative, and I have not found anything else in the text that might be said to promote dynastic claims or the special interests of the Count of Auvergne, his putative patron. The writer's further account of laphet's progeny and that of his two brothers in the different parts of the inhabited world touches on the history of the Babylonian and Persian empires as it is reflected in the Scripture, notably in the Books 55</page><page sequence="2">of Daniel and Esther. What follows (fols. 18-24) is a brief summary of the contents of each of the books of the Old Testament, and after this, two short sections on Christians and Muslims (24v). These passages differ markedly from one another in substance and tone. That which is devoted to the Christian side is not much more than a recital of the books of the New Testament, their authors and the intended beneficiaries of their exhortations. The writer also explains that the preaching of the Apostles had the effect of eradicating the idolatrous worship of the ancient gods and of substituting Christian festivals for them, but a certain distance, or even a touch of irony, may be detected in his declared intention "to deal only briefly with the Evangelists' assertion that they had heard and even seen the deeds and sayings of Jesus Christ and of others they had heard from the Apostles [...]."7 By contrast, the section devoted to the Muslims deals concretely with their beliefs. Muslims, the writer states, adhere to the law of Moses. Muhammad commanded them not to eat ritually impure meat and prohibited the cult of stars to which they were accustomed to offer fasts and sacrifices. But Muhammad himself, who was learned in astronomy, the natural sciences and the magical arts, did not scruple to put these skills to use in order to make prognostications or to determine the appropriate time to wage a successful war against one's enemies.8 Without much of a transition, the chronicle once more takes up Daniel, who, according to the writer, "had foreseen with greater clarity than the other prophets the coming judgment of peoples, the salvation of the just and the destruction of the wicked." First (fols. 25-25v), Nabuchadnez- zar's dream of the composite colossus with feet of clay and its destruction are recounted, followed by Daniel's interpreta- tion (2:1-49). The writer then relates the Prophet's vision of the four beasts (7:1-28), which is explained to him by an angel (fols. 25v-28). This explanation corresponds to the exegesis of the vision diffused in the Medieval West chiefly through the agency of Jerome's Commentary on Daniel, where it is held that the beasts stand for the four ancient empires which succeeded one another, Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome.9 We then (fols. 28-30v) hear of Daniel's vision of the combat between a ram and a one-horned he-goat, and the former's defeat by the latter (8:1-27), symbolizing the struggle between the Persians and the Greeks and the victory of Alexander over Darius. Moses ben Abraham's explanation of this prophecy is drawn out at great length, since it includes the traditional speculation on the meaning of the Seventy Weeks (9:24) and the two thousand and three hundred days (8:14) for the reckoning of the duration of time that must elapse before the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the onset of the Messianic age.10 The author's calculations lead him to conclude that the critical event will take place in the year 1290, and the new age be definitively ushered in forty-five years later, in 1335.11 Alexander's conquest of Persia having been adumbrated, the text takes up the career of the Macedonian (fols. 39v-50), of whom the author furnishes an engagingly fantastic portrait: "He was very wise and strong and brave (preus) in everything that he undertook... He did not resemble father or his mother, but rather had the appearance of a lion. His eyes shone. The right one was black and looked to the fore, while the left one was yellow, like the eye of a cat, and looked back. His teeth were sharp like the teeth of a dog, and he was brave and just like a lion already in young age."'2 The text follows Josephus (Ant. lud. Xl, 8) in the relation of the hero's march on Jerusalem and his respectful attitude toward the God of Israel and the priests of the Temple. 13 The Alexander romance supplied the information for the extraordinary adventures of the Greek campaign in the East.14 The division of Alexander's empire among four successor kings provides the author with another opportunity to document for the reader the progressive unfolding of history according to Daniel's prophecy. The text now chronicles the agitated history of the Hellenistic rulers in the Holy Land, based on the two Books of Maccabees and the parallel narratives found in Josephus' Jewish Antiquities and the opening chapters of the Jewish Wars.'5 This section of the work, nearly two thirds of its entire length, comes to an end somewhat abruptly with the story of the struggle between Herod and his sons, and the king of Cappadocia Archelaus' guileful deflection of Herod's anger against his son Alexander (Bellum lud. I, 508). The manuscript is written in a not very regular Gothic littera textualis, with much abbreviation. The text is introduced by a historiated initial, eleven lines high, with a portrait of the author seated at a pulpit, and depicted in the act of writing, in the manner of a learned man or philosopher (Fig. 1). The figure, whose face and hands are unfortunately lost through accidental or deliberate abrasion, wears a mauve-colored mantle draped over a red robe, and a pink bonnet.16 On the upper right arm, there is a circular, white-rimmed badge, the rouelle, which identifies him as a Jew. The Third Lateran Council (1215) had decreed that Jews should be required to wear distinctive garb. According to U. Robert, the use of the wheel (rota, rotella) as an identifying sign for Jews seems to be of French origin.17 The synodal statutes of the bishop of Paris Eudes of Sully (d. 1208) stipulate the wearing by Jews of a rota, usually made of cloth or parchment and fastened on the outer garment, and this prescription was repeated by later church assemblies. The rule was given official sanction for the entire kingdom through a decree of Louis IX, issued in 1 269, and later confirmed by Philip the Fair. 56</page><page sequence="3">*.B^ le8 i?d|^fe8 qui tl (Photo: Koninklijke Bibliotheek). While the opening initial of the manuscript is a fully painted century addition to the original subscription, all concern Daniel's prophecies. They are placed in specially tailored spaces within the text or in the marginkls, and stand in isolation on the parchment, without a frame or an indication of the setting. Some of the images are accompanied by explanatory inscrip- tions, some formulated in French, others in Latin. The first of these illustrations (Fig. 2), also damaged by rubbing, concerns the great statue of Nabuchadnezzar's dream, reduced to dust and carried away by the wind (2:3 1 ff). The head of fine gold is envisioned by the artist as having been crowned. The arms are of silver, as indicated in the Biblical text, and the belly and thighs of brass are rendered in red.

While the text of the Latin Vulgate speaks of the destruction of the statue by a stone which struck its weakest part, the feet ("et percussit statuam in pedibus eius"), this verse does not occur in Moses ben Abraham's French version. The omission probably explains the fact that in the picture, the stone strikes the head or neck of the image, and suggests that the artist relied for guidance on the translation and not on the more authoritative scriptural source. The interpretation of the wind ("un tourbillons de vent" in the translation) in the margin below and on another page of the manuscript (fol. 26. Fig. 3) also deserves to be noted. It departs from the ancient and medieval habit of personifying winds in the guise of bearded and horn-blowing divinities,18 and substitutes for this anthropomorphic conven- tion a more "literal", graphically mimetic ideogram, a large, drop-like form shaded with wavy lines and tones that are meant to evoke the movement of air. A second set of illustrations (Fig. 3) is devoted to Daniel's vision of the four beasts, surrounded on the page by the four winds which announced the appearance of these fantastic creatures of the sea. The first beast is described in the Latin Vulgate as being "like a lioness" ("quasi leaena"), with the wings of an eagle: "I beheld till her wings were plucked off, and she was lifted from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was given to her" (7:4). The French text, here at odds with Jerome as well as later interpreters, but significantly faithful to the meaning of the Hebrew 'aryeh, calls the animal a lion ("un lyon").19 The painter (Fig. 3, left) once again followed the vernacular translation on this point, with which the rubric leo, visible just above the wings of the animal, agrees. His lion has a golden head with a crown, and a grey body. The man's heart on its breast oddly bears the features of a youthful face.20 The beast is also equipped with human hands and feet, and so it would seem, human rather than leonine pudenda. I have no really satisfactory explanation for this puzzling aspect of the image. It may well be, however, that the mixture of human and animal features in the characterization of the beast was encouraged by an ambiguity in the translator's rendering of the Biblical "et cor eius datum est ei" as "et avait cors de homme", since the word cors can be read in the vernacular as either heart (coeur) or body (corps). The second creature (bottom, center), described as resem- bling a bear (7:5), is silver-colored. In the place of three rows of teeth mentioned in the Vulgate ("et tres ordines erant in ore eius et in dentibus eius"), three horn-like protrusions depart from the snout, inspired once more by the French version of the same passage, which reads "et avait III. grans cornes en la bouche". Behind the animal, the curious and fiercely dramatic head of a man in profile seen in the act of speaking or shouting, stands for the mysterious voice with proclaims "Arise, devour much flesh." The third beast (right), a leopard-like animal with four heads and four bird's wings (7:6), is red and sports golden crowns, the latter perhaps meant to express the power given it, which extended, as the text states "dusques aux quatres angles de la terre". The fourth creature, called Bestia decem cornuum and the most ferocious of all (7:7-8) has a dark grey body with a barbed reddish spine (right, bottom). Three of its horns have been severed, and in the midst of the remaining seven, there is a human head, which stands for the little horn that sprang up between them, "with eyes like the eyes of a man... and a mouth speaking great things." The third group of illustrations refers to the Prophet's vision of the struggle of the ram and the he-goat (8:3ff). In the first pair of miniatures (Fig. 4), we see the one-horned goat as it makes its charge against the ram, descending upon it from above in a diving thrust, for "un de ses pies ne touchait terre". On the opposite page (Fig. 5), the animals are depicted again, the more placid, prancing ram at the top and the goat breaking the horns of its defeated opponent below. The sequence continues on the verso of the same sheet (Fig. 6), where in the first episode, the ram's horn is now broken. The reader is told that he may see its fall to the ground in the picture.21 In the second stage, the horn has been replaced by four new ones (8:8), and in the third, the little horn which came forth in their midst (8:9) has sprouted between them, animated, like the fourth beast of the earlier version, by human features. Throughout the entire sequence, the goat is red in color and has a blue horn, while the ram is blue and has golden horns. Setting aside the color the portrayal of these familiar animals, lively and relaxed, makes a more naturalistic impression than the fantastic creatures depicted on the previous page of the manuscript, of necessity remote from experience. The last two illustrations of the chronicle only repeat some of the images which have already been described. This occurs in connection with the writer's desire to draw out or to underscore the meaning of the prophecy, showing it to have been truly fulfilled or soon about to be. The ten-horned beast from the vision regarding the succession of the world empires (7:7) and the goat with four horns from the subsequent prophecy (8:8) thus appear together in the context of the author's prognostications concerning the coming end of time, "le temps des temps et le dernier des temps" (fol. 34). His purpose is here to demonstrate that although the visionary creatures may be different, they signify the same thing, pointing both to Rome's assumption of world power in the reign of Titus as the fourth and final regnum. The picture of the ram's defeat by the he-goat is repeated at a point in the course of the life of Alexander (fol. 39), when the priests of the Temple 58</page><page sequence="5">mftm.cntr tiutS n ta tor itnt lan nc tuic nl o f oir cmici-.t ^utl er &amp; :emitc fmnaitnbilot-n vn lpm qtli efl- toir enettlr-.!$ ditoir tele fi s it' we qua ef wTtiilr tit!s plainctt1rt I'f lee plumes i 3it'c ala tRIt ef Iil ott' o wc T mr c 'a N .r IniSt 'i lt auS t'e i1pne.

These illustrations have some antecedents, chiefly in the art of the earlier Middle Ages. Daniel's vision of the four beasts and the combat of ram and he-goat are depicted in the Roda Bible (Fig. 7), a manuscript from Catalonia thought to have been executed in the first half of the eleventh century, presumably on the basis of an older archetype.22 The dream of Nabuchadnezzar's statue and the visions of the four beasts and ram-goat combat are found among the illustrations of Jerome's Commentary on Daniel inserted in the group of manuscripts, designated as Branch II, of the Commentary of Beatus on the Apocalypse (Figs. 8 and 9).23 There is a separate tradition for the depiction of the vision of the four beasts in 60 t h:ntf te f-t.

In the Byzantine iconography, on the other hand, each animal has its rider, the ruler who incarnates one of the four world empires of the prophecy: Nabuchadnezzar (Babylon), Darius (Persia), Alexander (Greece), and Augustus (Rome). This Byzantine tradition appears to stand behind the several representations of the theme on a monumental scale that are documented in the territories of the German Empire during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries: the lost ceiling paintings in the choir of the church of St. Emmeram at Regensburg,25 the frescoes of the lower church at Schwarz- rheindorf near Bonn, the wall paintings in the Charnel House</page><page sequence="7">44 1 :r ltf ,amtttf- ctl 'r asor t Xr ctfic ofk. t re- iC noir Sbbnf.

Yet it has to be admitted that our evidence is too sparse to permit the assumption that the Book of Daniel was illustrated in a stable and sustained way during the Middle Ages. The sequence of Beatus manuscripts in which the comparable illustrations of Daniel's visions are found does not extend beyond the end of the twelfth century, and it is difficult to make the leap from this almost exclusively Hispanic enterprise to the very different northeastern French milieu in which the Hague codex was produced. There is, it is true, the interesting case of a Pamplona Bible, copied in northeastern France for a prince of Champagne at the beginning of the fourteenth century, which indicates that such an improbable "leap" over time and space in the copying of the manuscript could not be regarded as altogether out of the question.27 If, ultimately, the issue of the painter's source or sources must remain unresolved, we have noted that in a number of details, he was guided by the phraseology of the translation, and therefore not slavishly dependent on an older model that would of necessity have been prepared in association with the Latin Vulgate text. What can be said of the date of the manuscript and the place where it was written remains equally conjectural. I can think of no comparable gallery of animal pictures in book illumination of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. How- ever, there are some indications, in the finely delineated head which functions as the lion's heart, for example (Fig. 3, left), that the illuminator was distantly touched by the innovations in Parisian painting around the year 1300 that are associated with the activity of Master Honore.28 Both the nature of the work and some aspects of its style are also apt to call to mind the series of illustrated Apocalypses made in England during the second half of the thirteenth century, or their Continental offshoots, though it would be more accurate to speak here of a parallel development than of direct connec- tions.29 The style of the painted and minor calligraphic initials, or of an incidental feature of the decoration like the ornamental border composed of short flourished pen strokes in alternating colors aligned vertically along the left side of the text column (Figs. 2, 4) make it very likely that the manuscript originated within the same rough chronological and geographical coordin- ates.30 Who was Moses ben Abraham, and who was the man for whom he claims to have prepared his work? Several authors so named are recorded, but all, with one exception, lived well after our manuscript was made. The exception is Moses ben Abraham of Pontoise, who flourished in the twelfth century. A pupil of Jacob Tam (c. 1100-1170), he is remembered chiefly as a Tosafist, or commentator of the Talmud (or of the interpretation of the Talmud by earlier commentators). He also wrote a number of liturgical poems, and he is believed to be the author of a commentary on the Pentateuch, now apparently lost.31 It is not known if he ever wrote in any language beside Hebrew. This point set aside, what the compiler of our chronicle himself says or implies speaks against the idea that he and his namesake might be one and the same man. In the context of his calculations regarding the impending onset of the last days, he seems to indicate that he was writing in the year 1244, or possibly 1246, which would have been well after the Pontoise Tosafist's career had likely come to an end.32 In our eyes, he is bound to look like a peculiar kind of Jew, though he might well have been a less exceptional figure in his than in our time. He knew Latin and sometimes quotes it 61</page><page sequence="8">S,~ ....,-. ..~. ,, , .% .~ ,,,- ? ,.Il... 7) Roda Bible, ((Daniel Scenes, Vision of the Four Beasts)) (third tier), Paris, Bibl.

Although not overly partisan or polemical in spirit, he gives what is basically a Christian reading of Hebrew prophecy, anticipating, for example, the coming of Antichrist.33 Yet there is no indication whatever that he might have been a convert.34 Even the precise nature of the work that he performed is by no means wholly clear. In his own words, he "arranged to put into plain French" (lai tretie a metre en plain francois") a book written at the behest of his patron, the Count of Auvergne. His activity might thus best be described as that of a translator or general editor, though it would seem reasonable to suppose that the qualifications which particularly recommended him for this task were not so much those of a stylist than of a man who, as a Jew, could lay special claim 9) Beatus of Saint-Sever, ((Combat Between Ram and Goat), Paris, Bibl. Nat. lat. 8878, fol. 239, (Photo: Biblio- thdque Nationale). to familiarity with the language and background of the Biblical text.35 The county of Auvergne was established as a separate entity following the dislocation of the duchy of Aquitaine during the later years of the tenth century. It never achieved in the course of its existence the importance of other feudal principalities like the duchies of Berry, Burgundy or Champagne, and its history, taken as a whole, is not very well documented. The account of the fortunes of the princely house written by the famous jurist and historian Etienne Baluze and published in 1708 remains to this day the most detailed treatment of the subject.36 It is known that around 11 55, following a quarrel between two members of the reigning house who both bore the name William, the county was divided. The older claimant 63 % . . j i ; N /,jt . i ~~~~~~~~~~~~/...

After peace was finally made in 1 230, the larger part of Auvergne was absorbed into the royal domain, while Count William was able to retain for his clan only the smaller parcel of land remaining around the county stronghold of Vic-le- Comte. But William was able to improve his situation through an advantageous marital alliance with the heiress of the county of Boulogne, Alix of Brabant, whose lands were united after her death (1 260) with the Auvergnat domain.38 After William's death in 1247, there were only two counts of that name that need be mentioned, William XI, who seems to have held the title for less than a year (1277), and William XII, whose late dates, from 1326 to 1332, probably disqualify him from any connection with the making of the manuscript. 1 The Hague, Royal Library, Ms. 131 A 3 (124 fols., 230 x 151 mm). Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Regiae, I, The Hague, 1922, p. 245, No. 696. The manuscript is cited by A. Jubinal, Lettres a M. le Comte de Salvandy sur quelques-uns des manuscrits de la Bibliotheque Royale de La Haye, Paris, 1846, pp. 18-19, and E. Brayer, "Jubinal et les manuscrits de la Bibliotheque Royale de la Haye," Bulletin d'information de I'lnstitut de recherches et d'histoire des textes, 3, 1954, p. 79. It is described in the exhibition catalogue Schatten van de Koninklijke Bibliotheek, The Hague, 1980, pp. 66-67, No. 26. 2 "Mesires li quens Guillaume dauvergne qui convoite a avoir et a savoir les nessances et les lignies des le commencement del siecle et velt savoir les batailles qui ont este faites anciennement et les fet escrire en cest livre.

In this and other citations from the manuscript, I have respected the orthography of the scribe, but expanded the abbreviations. On the medieval association of red hair with Jews, see the study of R. Mellinkoff, "Judas's Red Hair and the Jews," Journal of Jewish Art, IX, 1982, pp. 31-46. 3 The development and significance of family history (histoire lignagere) in the High Middle Ages are the subject of studies by G. Duby, "Remarques sur la litterature genealogique en France aux Xle et XI lle siecles," Hommes et structures du moyen age, Paris-The Hague, 1973, pp. 287-98, and "Structures de parente et noblesse dans la France du Nord aux Xle et Xlle siecles," Idem, pp. 267-85. It should be noted, too, that after 1260, the incumbents styled themselves Counts of Auvergne and of Boulogne, while the opening address of our chronicle makes reference only to the first-named territory. It must therefore be concluded that the work could only have been composed for one of three men, William VIII, who is last heard of in 1 182, his son William IX (d. before 1 1 95) or William X, his grandson (1 229-47). But since, following his own testimony, the author was involved in the composition of his chronicle in the year 1244, William X must be our man. An important corollary to emerge from these deductions is that the Hague manuscript cannot be the original draft of the work or a contemporaneous reflection thereof, but must represent a later copy, perhaps made for one of the descendants of Moses' patron or a member of the same princely house. The fact that the chronicle puts the beginning of the forty-five year period before the final reckoning in 1290 would have made the work acutely topical at this time, and when, moreover, the impact of Joachim de Fiore's prophecies had procured for eschatological speculation a devoted audience.39 4 D.

Apocalyptic Traditions in the Middle Ages, New York, 1979, p. 26. 1 On the Jewish side, the author's prediction has a parallel in the opinion of Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (1240-after 1291), who also announced the coming of the Messianic age in the year 1290 (5050 in the Hebrew calendar). There is no indication, however, that Moses ben Abraham knew of Abulafia's doctrine. (On this figure, see the articles of H. H. Ben Sasson, "Messianic Movements," Encyclopedia Judaica, Xl, 1971, 1424, and G. Scholem, "Abulafia, Abraham ben Samuel," Encyclopedia Judaica, II, 185-86. In Christian eschatological speculation, the end of the thirteenth century was associated with the hopes for the coming of an Angelic Pope, centering on the figure of Celestine V (1294). 12 Fol. 40: "II estoit sages et fors et preus et vaillans en tout quil que il faisoit et son maistre avoit non aristotes et il ete sages outre mesure ne Alexandre ne resembloit de chiere na son pere na sa mere.

Raff, "Die Ikonographie der mittelalterlichen Windpersonifi- kationen," Aachener Kunstblatter, XIX, 1957, pp. 89-146, and for Daniel, pp. 102-4. 19 In making the beast a lioness, Jerome follows the Septuaginta, which is at variance with the Hebrew text on this point. In his commentary on Daniel (Pat. lat. XXV, 628), he makes much of the female sex of the creature in order to characterize Babylon's special wickedness: "Regnum Babylonium propter saevitiam, et luxuriam, sive propter crudelitatem, et vitam libidini servientem, non leo, sed leaena appelatur." In Comestor's Historia Scholastica (Pat. lat. CXCVIII, 1453), the beast is also called a lioness, and so it is also in Guyart des Moulins' French translation of this work. For advice on this matter, I am indebted to my colleague Steven D. Fraade of the Department of Religious Studies, Yale University. 20 A somewhat similar device, though in another context, is found among the illustrations of the thirteenth-century North Italian Chan- sonnier in the Pierpont Morgan Library, Ms. 819, fol. 16.

CC. XLIIII." Further on in the same passage, the writer says that "selon le conte des ebrieux il a des que tytus destruit Jerusalem M C et LXXVI, and since this destruction took place in the year 70 C.E., this would imply that the author was writing in 1246. 33 Fol. 32v: "Car a cest derrenier terme sont toutes ces choses passees et de helyas le prophete et de antechrist..." Another formula- tion of the writer (fol. 31) "... que la sainte loy est escrite par la bouche au saint esperit..." has an equally Christian ring. 34 I must acknowledge the very helpful advice of Prof. Michael A. Signer of Hebrew Union College, Los Angeles, on this question, and on the state of scholarship regarding the knowledge of Latin by Jews in the Middle Ages. 35 For a somewhat similar case, see C.-O.
