<plain_text><page sequence="1">Apparently as a preparatory step for a new edition of the treatise which must still be read in Littre's edition of the works of Hip- pocrates (Oeuvres completes d'Hippocrate, VI [1849], pp. 276 ff.), Schubring has studied the manuscript-tradition (chap. I), the early editions of the Renaissance (chap. II), and such quotations from the book as are to be found in ancient authors (chap. III). I have no means of checking Schubring's description of the two classes of manuscripts in which De locis is preserved (A = Parisinus gr. 2253, s. XI; V = Vaticanus gr. 276, s. XII and its five deriva- tives). From what he says one certainly gains the impression that he has worked thoroughly and carefully. The result arrived at is that A and V are of equal value and that, whenever their readings disagree, a decision can be made only from the context of the passage (p. 30). The study of the Renaissance editions is mainly concerned with the manuscripts used by the early editors and with the interde- pendence of these printings. Schubring thereby continues and partly corrects his earlier inquiries (cf. his expose of the manuscripts in K. Deichgriiber, Hippokrates, Uber Entstehung und Aufbau des menschlichen Korpers [Hcp;t oapK(cv], 1935, pp. vii ff.); he also takes up the investigations of Diller in regard to Hippocratic manuscripts and editions (cf. Philol., Supplement XXIII [1932], Heft 3; Gnomon, XII [1936], pp. 367 ff.). The critical discussion of certain passages of De locis as given here and throughout Schubring's dis- sertation (cf. the index of these passages at the end of the book) will be of great value for all future references to this Hippocratic treatise until the new edition appears. The last chapter is interesting because it definitely proves that the Hippocratic work, stimulating as it may seem to the modern, did not find much favor with the ancients. To be sure, it was included relatively early in the collection of Hippocratic writings (p. 71). Even Galen considered it genuine, as Schubring is now able to show by means of the recently published Arabic translation of Galen's commentary on the second book of the Epidemiae (p. 64). Yet, generally speaking, De locis did not play an important part in the discussion of Greek physicians, nor did the Arabs consider it worth their while to make a translation of it (p. 72). The book, independent and original in its outlook, did not fit into the picture of Hippocratic medicine as commonly adopted in late centuries, nor could it be accommodated to these " Hippocratic" views even by ancient critics, broadminded as they were in matters pertaining to the genuineness of writings.

Chap. I, Contactus, starts with the adjective augustus as describing what is consecrated, above all templa sacerdotum rite dicata manu (where the ceremony was one of holding the doorpost) and passes to the importance ascribed to contact with earth. Exhaustive considera- tion is given to the use of herbs, etc., by the fetiales,l in lectisternia, and in manumission, and to the grass of the place of sacrifice (pp. 29, 36: Vedic and Persian parallels suggest themselves); to the consecra- tion of persons and objects; to auguria and auspicia; to the touching of altars, etc., and to the use of the stone, which is also Iuppiter Lapis, in oath-ceremonies. Chap. II, Imperium, discusses the accla- mation of the victorious leader by that title and argues that imperare is not in-paro but is related to parere; imperator is to be "levens- verwekker" (p. 67), and imperium the mana of the chief. Chap. III, Numen, Novensiles en Indigetes, shows the closeness of numen to mana, explains novensiles as nou-ensiles (p. 83; from nuo &lt; no&amp;io &lt; neuo) and rightly rejects Koch's theory of the mean- ing of indigetes. -Wagenvoort's analysis is searching and candid; he offers the alternative suggestion indu-agens or rather qui indu agitur (pp. 95 ff.; indigitare is treated as cognate). Chap. IV, Gravitas en Maiestas, illustrates the typical Roman emphasis on these words and argues that the basic sense of gravitas is weight in the literal sense, giving evidence from sophisticated times for emphasis on the physical weight or density of supernatural beings or objects. So maiestas is " size," but it is assigned to a period of more advanced development and credited with a greater degree of abstractness. WAagenvoort finds an analogy in kabod (pp. 108 ff.), quoting from Caspari the definition "die Summe alles dessen, wodurch einer (oder etwas) sich auszeichnet." Chap. V, Contagio, discusses " strong" and "weak" mana, the notion of contagio funesta and the exclusion from certain ceremonials of slaves, foreigners, women, and persons in chains. Attention is paid also to expiatio; to ceremonies of passing through a door or other aperture,2 Janus (pp. 153 ff.) and the porta triumphalis (pp. 158 f.); to the " polarity " of contagio and to rituals of passing over a person or thing (cf. Peter's shadow in Acts 5, 15: also Thurnwald, Z. f. Asthetik, XXI [1927], p. 327 on Maori women stepping over a lizard to avert the evil which it threatens, and the same writer in M. Ebert, Reallexikon der Vorgeschichte, XIII, p. 166 for a Maori woman crossing a threshold to break the ban on it). Chap. VI, Vis genitalis, discusses genius, iuno, and the mana of the renewal of life. The conclusion is charming and modest (p. 187), and there is an excellent index. 1 Here, as with the corona graminea, it is the grass of a particular site.

In so doing he makes many good and acute observations; e.g. p. 16 that augustus, unlike sacer, is not ambivalent; pp. 16ff. on the difference between consecratio and dedicatio; 3 p. 37, n. 2 on the inauguratio of pontifices; p. 50, n. 2 on asylum; pp. 54 f. on the danger of leaning too heavily on Livy; p. 79 on Virgil's understanding of old piety; p. 82 "a primitive society knows no mere symbols"; pp. 100 f. on [AG]ON(ium) IND (igetis) in the Ostian Fasti; p. 124 on maiestas senatus. The main thesis presents many difficulties to a reviewer, who should ideally be a master of Comparative Philology, Anthropology, Ancient Religion, Roman Law, and the Dutch language; vae soli! It is clearly pressed too far: 4 past experience gives little ground for optimism as to inferences based on etymology; at best, they do not prove the meaning or associations of a word at any given time. Let us for a moment put aside detail and ask the basic question: how far is the whole approach justified? How far can we interpret Roman custom and language, zede en taal, from our knowledge of primitive peoples? And what is the value of anthropological parallels ? 5 Primitives, as commonly defined, make up an aggregate varying enormously in degree of development and in nature and nurture. Yet as a whole they differ from civilized men mainly in that they lack the art of writing, i. e. the use of convenient symbols sufficiently narrowed in meaning (a point emphasized by Thurnwald) and employed not only to transact ordinary business and to implement the use of magical formulas, but also to fix and preserve traditions and ideas. Ritual poems and ballads can live without writing but, in general, the free use of written characters is our continuity. With- out it, man's mental horizon seldom extends more than three or five generations backwards (cf. W. Wyse on Isaeus, VII, 22 and E. Wiist in R.-E., VII A, col. 324 on the lengths to which relationship was traced). Nevertheless, the primitive is not a different biological animal; he is by no means necessarily less sophisticated or less prone to make elaborate social and religious patterns; and his problems of subsistence and self-adjustment, physical and moral, are not alto- gether diverse from those of civilized man. Again, many of the characteristic forms of Roman life antedate at least any extended use of writing. Parallels have in fact been very illuminating; it is only through them that we understand the restrictions which hedged around the life of the flamen Dialis. Analogies will not teach us what happened in the past: they may help to keep our reconstructions within limits consistent with what is known to happen. The concept of mana involves and formalizes an awareness of 3 That is, as used strictly; both can bear also a transferred sense. 4 Cf. G. M. A. Hanfmann, C. W., XXXVI (1943), pp. 139 ff. Again, on p. 117, Propertius, II, 25, 22: nulla diu femina pondus habet simply means "any woman is fickle " and has nothing whatsoever to do with mana. 5 Cf. W. R.

There is a sense that all around man are potentialities for good or evil which affect him and which should somehow be applied to his purpose or, if dangerous, should be so treated as to be made of no effect. Things are not just as they seem: their unseen qualities are communicated by touch or taste or smell, along the channels of the senses. The term mana is Polynesian and other peoples have words for a corresponding category; 6 but something like the notion is part of all supernaturalism, high or low, and affords what R. R. Marett called "a minimum definition of religion," 7 and Nilsson "the first seed- ground of religion itself." 8 So awareness of " power" may fairly be called an universal substratum or datum of human consciousness. Neither Greece nor Rome has any term as extensive and yet specific as mana, orenda, wakonda, but the notion of power and of its transference is clearly present and numen is nearer to mana than any Greek word is. H. J. Rose, who made this observation, has proved for Rome the superimposition of a personal on an impersonal view of supernatural (or, as Nilsson would put it, supranormal) action.9 His demonstration is the more noteworthy in that the concept of " power " commonly co-exists not only with that of supernatural and ghostly personalities but also with primitive ideas of High Gods,10 and emerges, sometimes with special vigor, in developed prophetic religions. Rose has shown a specific change of ideas which involves more than the transference to particular deities of rites originally effective in themselves. Nevertheless, I suspect that, as far back as anything like Latin was spoken, an element of anthropomorphism was attached to some aspects of the supernatural. Wagenvoort himself cautions us (pp. 117ff.) against an over simple distinction between dynamistic and animistic stages, and remarks on the signifi- cance of the form Iuppiter as asserting fatherhood. Iuppiter may in a notable way have supplied a focus for crystallization. The change was probably one of gradual evolution, one of degree rather than of kind. Sive dens sive dea and sire mas sive femina show vagueness of outline; and yet, as Altheim remarked,11 they indicate 6 For the term " category," cf. Nilsson, Rev. Hist. Phil.

In the Arval hymn Mars is a fully developed per- sonality invoked in prayer and not compelled by magic (E. Norden, Aus altromischen Priesterbiichern, p. 150); and yet then and later the peculiarity of numen continues. Among modern primitives also there is a measure of alternation between a personal and an impersonal view. We need not shrink from using the analogy of mana whenever we are dealing with what was specifically religious at Rome. Can we, with Wagenvoort, extend the concept to wider areas in private and public law, and in civic life? Mana and its parallels are. associated with secular no less than with religious powers and skills: mana is an universal category, above the other differentiations of the world. Now the Romans invested civil (as also religious) office with a greater emotional aura of prestige than is found in the Greek republics.12 The gods have maiestas 13 and so have the people and the magistratus, whose very name is cognate; and exactly the same concept of magnitude is expressed in the sacrificial formula macte esto. Such phrases as maiestas laesa, maiestas violata have a distinct suggestion of sacrilege: cf. Ulpian, apud Dig., XLVIII, 4, 1: proxi- mum sacrilegio crimen est, quod maiestatis dicitur (and in Ulpian it is still an offence against the Roman people and not against the princeps). Maiestas is almost the secular counterpart of numen. A magistratus possessed not only imperium but also auspicia, the conduct of public affairs in the national and supernational sphere. Wagenvoort indeed finds more of the " primitive " in gravitas; I am inclined to disagree. Certainly the concept that weight was characteristic of the supernatural lingered in and after the Augustan Age14 and appears in Christian writers. Further, a Roman did not use a dictionary distinguishing between primary and secondary meanings. Nevertheless, the main connotation of gravitas was that of morality, disciplined dignity, and all that went with the normal Roman ideal of the responsible individual-all that is implicit in Aeneid, I, 151, pietate gravem ac meritis. Is there any more notion of weight as supernatural here than in Tennyson's 12 Greek has the generalized title dpXwv, and contrast between apxwv and 18wTrs, the proverb dpX' av5pa ei'tet (" office will show the man"; cf. Plutarch, Apophth. Lac., Ages., 6, p. 208 D)-in other words the counterpart of magistratus, but nothing native corresponding to imperium, which is a more extensive term. (Cf. proconsular imperium and in the later Roman Republic privati cum imperio.) Can you imagine an exact Greek equivalent of Gellius, I, 13, 3, cuius id negotium pontificiumque esset, as a metaphor? It may be appropriate to adduce the contrast made by E. Kornemann, Die Antike, VIII (1932), p. 108, between the Romans with their sanctity of walls and doors and the Greeks of whom he quotes von Gerkan's words " die Stadtmauer gilt hier nur als Zweckbau und hat in diesemn Sinne mit dem Staatskult nie das Geringste zu tun." The only sentiment attached to the Greek wall is that of patriotism (cf. Heraclitus, Frag. 44). 13 Cf. T.L.L., VIII, col. 152 and, ibid., col. 153, its use in the " Itala" to render 86ta. Pliny, Paneg., 4, 6 contrasts maiestas and humanitas. 14 To Wagenvoort's examples add Lucan, I, 56 f. but subtract VIII, 724 (it needs no supernatural attribute to make a corpse heavy to carry through low water).

We should hardly connect qos, " height " in the treatise O the Sublime with the undoubted belief that supernatural beings and some ghosts were taller than ordinary people!

To meet Wagenvoort on his own ground, gravitas is a quality which you ought to possess, while mana is an attribute which you would like to possess. (The private individual, qua private individual, does not have maiestas.) Shall we follow Wagenvoort in his interpretation of the custom of acclaiming as imperator a victorious general? His etymology from parere is not acceptable (so Professor Whatmough assures me), and it is paradoxical to treat phrases like imperare vitibus as any- thing but derivative. We may allow that the word came from the battlefield and not from the Senate house, and that its adoption by Sulla and Julius Caesar and Octavian suggests "certain element religieux, ou, du moins, magique sur laquelle la mystique nouvelle pouvait s'appuyer." 5 It clearly implied felicitas; imperator was suggestive of invictus, a word expressive of emotion (e. g. Aen., VI, 365 and Livy, II, 50, 5), and involved a personal charisma. In any event, imperator described the general (whether consul, praetor, pro- magistrate, or privatus cztm imperio) in relation to his troops and it is applied to gods and to foreigners; such a term as consul is hardly ever transferred to members of either category. The easiest explanation of the use of imperator in acclamations is given by Appian, B. C., II, 177 " as though the soldiers testified that their commanders deserved that rank," KaOa7rep aVTroLs 7rLwLapTvpowVrwV at(lo cra)(ov aVrOKpdaopao ctvat. It is a spontaneous action, without constitutional consequences: imperator is here " general " rather than "possessor of imperihlm." Is the practice old? To be sure, Livy, XXVII, 19, 4 neither asserts nor implies innovation. Further, even in earlier times soldiers and populace alike can hardly have regarded their generals in the impersonal manner of Cato in his writing of history; 16 and war must have been more individualistic before the introduction of hoplite tactics.17 Nevertheless, there is no previous trace, historical or legendary, of the use of the acclamation imperator, and the custom may have arisen as a product of foreign wars conducted by promagistrates 18 15 J. Gage, Rev. Hist., CLXXVII (1936), p. 339; cf. J. Carcopino, Points de vue sur l'imnprialisme Romain, pp. 126 ff. and A. von Premler- stein, Vom TVerden u. Wesen d. Prinzipats (Abh. Miinch., N. F., XV 11937]), pp. 256 ff. There is a special irony in Catullus, 29, 11, imperator unice. 10 Cf. Livy, XLII, 49, 3 ff. (171 B. C.) cited by J. Stroux, Die Antike, XIII (1937), pp. 203 f. Stroux regards the description as abridged from Polybius. 17 Cf. Nilsson, J. R. S., XIX (1929), pp. 1 ff. I dare not enter on the problem of the coniuratio; cf. K. Latte, Gitt.

Riccobono, II. 104</page><page sequence="7">and involving a more personal relation between the soldiers and their general than was felt towards the consuls with their alternation of power. If the answer to the question lies therefore in Livy's lost second Decade, the phenomenon belongs to a milieu very different from that in which arose the ceremonies discussed in the first chapter. Even so, it is too early to be explained by Hellenistic ideas of theioi anthropoi or by the re-emergence in later Greek religion of the idea of power. Whatever its origin, imperator at least acquired a notable element of mana in the sense in which that word is today metaphorically used. It is hard to do full justice to this book; reading it as I have, with a dictionary, I must have missed many nuances. Further there remains a deep and perhaps an unanswerable question as to the extent to which the formulas and symbolic, almost sacramental, acts of Roman legal procedure are to be explained from religious con- cepts.19 Certainly these formulas and acts, and ius and fas alike, are not simple elements in a bloodless construction: like the formulas and ceremonies of Roman religion, they are penetrated by a deep feeling that things must be done in the one right way, under the one system of authority valid for a Roman; and after all, according to tradition, the ius respondendi originally belonged to the pontifices alone and the formulae actionis were in their archives. In some sense we can therefore find a psychological unity in many of the data which in this book are set side by side. The pattern is one of action and not, as in Polynesia, of categorization; the basis is that of common humanity. In the interests of classification we may define the situation more closely: it will be our definition and not a Roman definition; and yet the effort brings out important non-rational components: " Indess soll der Mensch sich die Aufgabe nicht desshalb verkleinern, um sich seine Unzulinglichkeit dadurch zu verbergen."
