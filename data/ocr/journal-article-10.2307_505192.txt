<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Aegean Prehistory I: The Islands of the Aegean JACK L. DAVIS INTRODUCTION Not so long ago the islands of the Aegean (fig. 1) were considered by many to be the backwater of Greek prehistory.' Any synthesis of the field had perforce to base its conclusions almost exclusively upon data collected before the turn of the century. The entire prehistory of the islands received fewer than 16 pages of discussion in Emily Vermeule's Greece in the Bronze Age (Chicago 1964), almost all of this concerned with the art and graves of the Early Bronze Age Cyclades; other parts of the Aegean sea were generally men- tioned only in passing. Vermeule had no choice but to write that for the Cyclades "only three village sites [Phylakopi on Melos, Kastri on Syros, and Thera] have been excavated in a manner one could call in- formative, in contrast to nearly two thousand known or suspected graves" (p. 47). Of these only Phylakopi also offered a deep stratigraphy covering all phases of the Bronze Age, and it is no surprise that its se- quence formed the basis for a tripartite Cycladic chro- nology, established parallel to Helladic and Minoan phases on the Greek mainland and Crete. The exis- tence of a Neolithic in the islands, particularly on Keos, Saliagos, and Chios, had been demonstrated but in no instance had been fully documented. A quarter century later, the situation has been al- tered drastically. Particularly in the last decade prog- ress has been very rapid, hampering any attempt to produce a totally up-to-date synthesis of new data, as does the frequent appearance of important studies in new Greek periodicals of limited circulation. Indeed, publication has been so voluminous and diverse that it is difficult even for specialist Aegean prehistorians to stay abreast of new developments. The essential annual reviews of new work in Greece, published by successive directors of the British and French schools S The publication of this review was made possible by a generous subvention from the Institute for Aegean Prehis- tory. I am particularly grateful to those friends and colleagues who responded to requests for information concerning their recent research, and in particular to those who provided me with offprints, preprints, or photographs. The more specific contributions of several colleagues are acknowledged as ap- propriate later in this review. Here I should like to express my thanks to Robert Arnott, Robin Barber, Cyprian Brood- bank, Tristan Carter, John Cherry, Christopher Chippin- dale, John Coleman, Michael Cosmopoulos, Tracey Cullen, Scren Dietz, Christos Doumas, Angelia Douzougli, Noel Gale, David Gill, David Hardy, Carol Hershenson, Donald Keller, Sandy MacGillivray, Sturt Manning, Lila Marangou, Mariza Marthari, Dimitris Matsas, Lyvia Morgan, Christine Morris, John Overbeck, Mehmet Ozdogan, Ernst Pernicka, Colin Renfrew, Efi Sakellaraki, Diamantis Sampson, Eliza- beth Schofield, Zophia Stos-Gale, Rene Treuil, Sarah Vaughan, David Wilson, and Kostas Zachos. Tracey Cullen, Fred Kleiner, and Jerry Rutter conceived of this project and encouraged me to undertake it. Over the past year and a half I have at times regretted accepting the assignment, and in moments of panic have cursed them severally and collec- tively, but I am in the end thankful that they convinced me to do it. I am also grateful to Shari Stocker for help with the illustrations and proofreading, to Bill Parkinson for compil- ing references, and to John Bennet, Cyprian Broodbank, John Cherry, Mihalis Fotiadis, Donald Keller, Sandy Mac- Gillivray, Sturt Manning, Curtis Runnels, Jerry Rutter, and David Wilson for their prompt comments on my penultimate draft.

DAVIS [AJA 96 in Archaeological Reports (AR) and in BCH's "Chro- nique des fouilles" ("Chronique") are, of course, es- sential points of departure for both scholars and students, but can be patchy in their coverage and, in any case, are not intended to be synthetic.2 The bible of Aegean prehistory, R. Hope Simpson and O.T.P.K. Dickinson's A Gazetteer of Aegean Civilisation in the Bronze Age 1: The Mainland and Islands (Goteborg 1979, completed 1977; hereafter, Gazetteer), is now nearly 15 years out of date, and in any case omitted coverage of the islands of the Aegean that lie north of Skyros and Chios.3 Robin Barber's The Cyclades in the Bronze Age (Iowa City 1987) provides an excellent overview of the results of research in the southern Aegean, but publications relevant to Cycladic prehis- tory have been so prolific in the past six years that an update is also desirable.4 BEYOND THE CYCLADES TO A PAN-AEGEAN PERSPECTIVE The decision to include virtually all islands of the Aegean (excluding only Crete and those of the Sa- ronic Gulf) reflects trends in recent scholarship that have defined problems demanding a canvas much broader than that offered by the Cyclades alone.5 Two examples of topics that require a pan-Aegean focus may suffice: the Neolithic colonization of the Aegean islands; and the Minoanization of the Aegean in the Middle Bronze Age and early part of the Late Bronze Age. In the past decade there have been, for the first time, systematic attempts to describe initial settlement of the islands of the Aegean in terms of principles drawn from island biogeography.6 The general idea Les Cyclades G.

Principal Aegean archaeological sites discussed in this review of these studies is that geography has played a major role in determining the date, extent, and rate of set- tlement in the Aegean. Examination of the way in which both animal and plant species have come to inhabit island groups in other parts of the world suggested that certain patterns of colonization might also be recognizable in Greece. For example, it has been hypothesized that the distance of an island from adjacent mainland coasts, its absolute size, and the presence or absence of stepping stone islands between it and a mainland were important factors in deter- mining the likelihood that the island will have been settled at a particular time in the past. This is not of course to suggest that social or political factors should be eliminated from the equation, but rather that biogeography can provide an initial investigative</page><page sequence="4">702 JACK L. DAVIS [AJA 96 framework within which the importance of cultural determinants of settlement can be more explicitly defined. Hand in glove with these analyses have come at- tempts to explain why extensive colonization of the Aegean islands occurred so long after settlement of adjacent mainlands. It has been realized for some years that the islands of the Aegean cannot have been inaccessible to potential human colonizers, inasmuch as obsidian from Melos was reaching the Greek main- land already in the later Palaeolithic and Mesolithic; finds are well documented in strata excavated at Franchthi Cave in the southern Argolid and are clearly Melian in origin.' The recognition that the Aegean was being navigated long before the intro- duction of agriculture to Greece has obvious and important repercussions for how the process by which agriculture was spread from the Near East to Greece is viewed: clearly an absence of evidence for settle- ment in the earlier phases of the Neolithic in the Greek islands no longer requires us to postulate the existence of a more northern route of migration for Neolithic immigrants, for which there has been pre- cious little evidence. The Aegean sea of the later Palaeolithic was navigable and navigated.8 Of equal importance is the realization that inhab- itants from the adjacent mainlands had the capability of establishing settlements in the Aegean islands long before they actually did so. Documentation in the future of any evidence for earlier transient activity is unlikely to make a great difference to present gen- eralizations. While it is certainly true that some settle- ments of Palaeolithic and earlier Neolithic date may be lost to fluctuations in coastlines or may yet lie undetected, the fact remains that no clear evidence of a Palaeolithic presence has yet been recognized in the islands, at least not on any island that was then sepa- rated from an adjacent mainland by an appreciable gulf. The evidence for earliest colonization of the Ae- gean islands has recently been updated.9 Most of the islands of the Aegean appear to have been first in- habited during the EBA, although traces of Neolithic habitation are more plentiful today than even a year or so ago. A Neolithic presence has now been docu- mented in the Cyclades (Keos, Naxos, Thera, Amor- gos, Paros, Saliagos, and Siphnos), in the northern Sporades (Kyra Panayia and Youra), on Chios, Psara, Samos, in most of the Dodecanesian islands, and on Limnos, Lesbos, Samothrace, and Thasos. In all cases the earliest material yet recognized appears to be later in date than that from adjacent mainlands; in general, the final period of the Neolithic (FN) seems to have been the time of maximum expansion in settlement. The earliest well-documented Neolithic settlement is that of Ayios Petros on Kyra Panayia, situated near the eastern end of a string of islands that leads out into the Aegean from Thessaly, itself probably the most densely settled part of the Greek mainland dur- ing the Early and Middle Neolithic.1o Certainly it See C. Perlks, Les industries lithiques taille'es de Franchthi (Argolide, Grace) 1: Prisentation generale et industries paldo- lithiques (Franchthi 3, Bloomington 1987) 142-45; 2: Les industries du Misolithique et du Niolithique initial (Franchthi 5, Bloomington 1990). For further discussion of Melos and Franchthi Cave, see now also C. Renfrew and A. Aspinall, "Aegean Obsidian and Franchthi Cave," in Perliks 1990, 257- 70. These authors also note that postulated linkages between tunny fishing and collection of obsidian on Melos by main- landers are not supported by the evidence from Franchthi Cave, since obsidian has been found there in levels earlier than those in which evidence for deep sea fishing first ap- pears. 8 Recent research in Thessaly has tended to support a hypothesis that agriculture was introduced to Greece from the Near East through migration, rather than through trade between Near Easterners and an existing Mesolithic Greek population. For a current review of the evidence, see J. Hansen, "The Introduction of Agriculture into Greece: The Near Eastern Evidence," AJA 96 (1992) 340-41 (abstract). See also J.M.

Recent excavations and explorations in Turkish Thrace are of particular interest. At the site of Hoca Qegme in 1990- 1991 (phase IV), ceramics similar in character to those of central Anatolia, with parallels in Hacilar IX-VI, have been excavated. Preliminary notices of these results will appear in Araftzrma Sonu(larz, and Germania. See also M.J. Mellink, "Archaeology in Anatolia," AJA 96 (1992) 125; and M. Oz- dogan, Y. Miyake, and N.

Palaeolithic finds have also been re- ported from various sites on Alonnisos, Kyra Panayia, and Skyros, all in the northern Sporades, but are not yet well documented; see "First Colonization" 167. Stretches of open sea between these islands and the mainland of Thessaly may also have been negligible.</page><page sequence="5">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 703 cannot be doubted that Early Neolithic populations were capable of organizing and launching large-scale colonizations across open sea. The settlement of the island of Crete in the later eighth or earlier seventh millennium is an obvious example of a successful enterprise of that sort, one that "indicates an exoge- nous introduction of farming and farmers through a purposive, planned and comparatively long-range colonization." That island, like others of the Aegean, thus far lacks any clear evidence for pre-Neolithic activity."I It is equally important that those conditions be determined that eventually did result in successful colonization of the Aegean islands and in extensive, widespread, and long-lived settlement. A Neolithic agricultural package of domesticated crops and ani- mals would have offered potential colonists a better chance for long-term survival in areas where wild resources were restricted. But although a Neolithic way of life was an obvious precondition for the via- bility of long-term occupations on the tiny and re- source-poor islands of the Aegean, it cannot have been the only factor in play. Indeed, there is a gap of some two to four millennia between the colonization of Crete and that of the Cyclades, northern Sporades, or the Dodecanese, despite the fact that some of these islands lie directly along potential lines of migration between Crete and Anatolia. Principles of island bio- geography also suggest that the survival rate of settle- ments close to colonizing mainlands will be higher, since their populations will be able to look to the neighboring mainlands for support, whether for mar- riage partners, breeding stock, or, in crisis, even for seed grain.12 The colonization of Crete should thus be seen as a purposeful effort to found a new settle- ment in an especially favorable island environment, and not as the result of a gradual expansion of pop- ulation through the islands to its north and east. Three general horizons of Neolithic colonization in the Cycladic islands have recently been defined: the first contemporary with the site on Saliagos, an islet that in the fifth millennium B.C. was situated on a land bridge that joined Paros and Antiparos; the sec- ond contemporary with the fourth-millennium FN site of Kephala on Keos; and the third represented by the expansion of population at the transition be- tween the Neolithic and EBA that resulted in the creation of the Early Cycladic culture.'3 Notional col- onizations of the Cycladic islands have been modeled: one beginning from the Greek mainland (specifically from Attica and Euboia), and another starting from the Dodecanese and progressing via Ikaria and As- typalaia. On the basis of these models it has been suggested that in the Saliagos phase, it is most likely that colonists came to the Cyclades from the southeast Aegean alone, but that later colonists probably pro- ceeded from both directions at once. In all cases, the survival of settlements on Naxos would have been especially favored by circumstances of natural geog- raphy. Indeed, only on Naxos have traces of all three phases of settlement been recognized and only on Naxos can a case for continuity in settlement through- out the Late Neolithic and Final Neolithic periods be made. A clearer understanding of the factors that led to expansion of settlement into the islands of the Aegean will also require a careful examination of the character of societies in those areas likely to have provided colonists. Although a topic well beyond the scope of this review, it is worth noting that there appears to be a close correlation between an expansion of settlement on the island of Euboia and the establishment of settlements in many of the Cycladic islands during the Final Neolithic. In particular, the habitation of mar- ginal parts of southern Euboia could be seen as part of a general movement of populations into marginal areas, the beginning of a trend that would lead to a prodigious expansion of settlement in the EBA.'4 So- cial, as well as geographical, problems would have been faced by early colonists in the Cyclades. Several of these have recently been examined in a study that seeks to explain the differential development of Crete and the Cyclades in the course of the EBA.'15 The role of exogamy in linking relatively tiny communities of I C.

I am extremely grateful to Cyprian Brood- bank for a copy of the text of his paper as read, and for permission to summarize his argument here. 14 On the relationship between settlement in southern Euboia and FN/EBA colonization of the Cyclades, see Keller and Cullen (infra n. 61). 15 S.W. Manning, "The Emergence of Divergence: Devel- opment and Decline on Bronze Age Crete and the Cyclades," in C. Mathers and S. Stoddart, Development and Decline in the Mediterranean Bronze Age (in press). There has as yet, however, been no serious attempt to use ceramic character- ization analyses to distinguish between a scenario in which items were produced on two different islands in the Neolithic within similar cultural traditions, and one in which items were traded between the same two islands. See J.E. Cole- man's (supra n. 8) discussion of evidence for Neolithic trade in the Aegean. I am grateful to both authors for preprints of their forthcoming publications.</page><page sequence="6">704 JACK L. DAVIS [AJA 96 the islands is emphasized. Exogamy, it is suggested, also promoted a stylistic homogeneity in artifacts within the Aegean, of a sort recognizable already in the earliest Neolithic Saliagos culture of the Cyclades. By the second phase of the EBA, however, exchanged goods had come into the hands of specialist produc- ers, partly because opportunities for the intensifica- tion of agricultural production were so limited, and the exchange of agricultural goods on a large scale infeasible. It is clear that exchange played a crucial role in enabling permanent settlement in the islands of the Aegean, even if it is not yet possible to quantify the extent of this trade. In the EBA, the similarities in the formal characteristics of ceramics, marble vessels, figurines, and metal objects that typify the Early Cy- cladic culture are indicative of social and economic ties maintained among the settlements of the islands; these relationships may also be regarded as necessary adaptations that would have provided access to addi- tional resources of food and manpower in times of crisis.16 Exchange may, therefore, be seen not as the incentive for colonization of the islands of the Aegean, but as an indispensable enabling mechanism that pro- moted the survival of groups once established, partic- ularly on smaller, more remote, and impoverished landfalls such as the so-called Amorgian islets of Epano and Kato Koufonisi, Donousa, Schinousa, or Keros. Our understanding of trade in metals has been dramatically improved in recent years. Much current literature has been summarized in the volume Bronze Age Trade in the Mediterranean.17 In general a clear pattern appears to have emerged from recent analy- ses. In the EBA Cyclades, Siphnos and Kythnos served as major sources for lead, silver, and copper. Both of these sources were replaced in the Middle Bronze Age by Laurion, which came to dominate the Aegean as the principal supplier of metals.18 It is clear too that exchange in marble vessels and figurines played a role in EBA exchange, but slight progress has been made in this arena. There is little agreement among scholars as to the validity of attributing marble figu- rines to individual sculptural hands or workshops, and there is little basis for assigning such personalities or production centers to particular locations within the Cyclades, because the vast majority of marbles lack verifiable archaeological contexts.'" For these rea- sons and because of their rarity, marble figurines are not likely ever to provide us with more than the crudest measurements of intra-Aegean exchange. Fewer than 2,000 figurines are known, and these were produced over some 600-700 years! The study of ceramic fabrics promises in the long run to be of greater value in reconstructing patterns of exchange. Given the diversity of geology among the islands of the Aegean, it is in many cases possible to recognize imported products on the basis of both visual inspection and petrological analysis. The results of a long-term project conducted under the auspices of the Fitch Laboratory of the British School at Athens should soon be available. This study has focused spe- 16 See J.F.

For the role of specific islands in prehistoric met- alworking and trade, see discussion of Karpathos, Keos, Thera, Chios, and Melos in the following section of this review. 18 Possible explanations for the replacement of Siphnos by Laurion as dominant supplier to Keos have been discussed by N.H. Gale, Z.A. Stos-Gale, and J.L. Davis, "The Prove- nance of Lead Used at Ayia Irini, Keos," Hesperia 53 (1984) 389-406. Evidence from the analysis of the small number of actual silver artifacts (as opposed to litharge samples) that have yet been examined is more equivocal: Laurion and Siphnos do not emerge so obviously as dominant sources. 19 On the definition of sculptural hands, see P. Getz- Preziosi, Sculptors of the Cyclades: Individual and Tradition in the Third Millennium B.C. (Ann Arbor 1987); see ch. 7 for patterns of distribution, such as they are, given the lack of a proper excavated context for the vast majority of figures.

It is antic- ipated that the final product will be presented in the form of a handbook that can be used in the field for fabric indentification.20 A second central issue in prehistory that benefits from a pan-Aegean perspective is the relationship between Crete and the islands of the Aegean in the MBA and earlier phases of the LBA, the time of the so-called Minoan Thalassocracy. Recent research on many of the Aegean islands leaves no doubt that contacts between Crete and the Cyclades became es- pecially intense after the construction of the Old Pal- aces.21 Exchange appears to have played a major role in motivating Cretan involvement in the affairs of the islands to its north. On many of these islands, local industries were deeply affected by the contact. Local styles of decoration, particularly for pottery, and local manufacturing techniques were abandoned in favor of Minoan-inspired prototypes. A number of these changes may well have resulted from elite emulation of the status goods produced by the Minoan civiliza- tion. Others, for instance the widespread adoption in the islands of Minoan forms of loomweights, may reflect subtler variation in the structure of Cycladic social and economic organization.22 Two items have been clarified by extensive recent debate. First, it is not possible to measure the extent of political control by the Cretans as a direct reflection of the extent of changes observable in the material culture of the islands. Political dominance by Crete may well have encouraged the adoption of Minoan ways in its overseas colonies. But conquest is, in and of itself, no real explanation for change in material culture: one can too easily point to a plethora of historical examples in which imperial control resulted in relatively few changes in the everyday life of the majority of the conquered. Second, there is an enormous diversity in the settle- ment history of those island centers that were pulled within the Minoan orbit. The entirety of the southern Aegean was strongly affected by contact with Crete; the northern Aegean appears to have lain largely outside the sphere of Cretan cultural influence. In the west, no evidence for a heavily Minoanized settlement has been recognized north of Keos; in the east, Kos is the dividing line. In the central Cyclades, Naxos marks the limit. None of this is to say, of course, that evidence for contact with Crete cannot be recognized farther to the north. Minoan ceramic imports have long been acknowledged at Pefkakia in Thessaly, and on Samos, while Minoan artifacts appear to have made their way even to Troy, albeit in small quantities.23 The recent discovery of a Minoan sealing and roun- del at the site of Mikro Vouni on Samothrace must be viewed within this general context.24 The situation of these discoveries, however remarkable, should be dis- tinguished from that of Cretan finds in the heavily Minoanized zone of the southern Aegean. Minoan finds north of an east-west line drawn between Attica 20 This project is under the direction of S.J. Vaughan, to whom I am extremely grateful for the information summa- rized here. Her work will soon be published in S.J. Vaughan, Early Bronze Age Cycladic Pottery Fabrics: Studies in Materials and Technology (Fitch Laboratory Occasional Paper 5, in prep.). Vaughan emphasizes that the evidence supports her hypothesis that "already in the EBA there were well-estab- lished trade and exchange routes throughout the Cyclades and beyond" and that there was "very specialized ceramic production and trade reflecting skilled exploitation of the best raw materials available on each island, with connections perhaps for exchange with other items such as ores." Various special studies in press or in preparation examine the so- called EBA talc ware (S. Vaughan and D. Wilson, "Interre- gional Contacts in the EB II Aegean: The Talc Ware Con- nection," in C.W. Zerner and E.B. French eds., Wace and Blegen: Pottery as Evidence for Trade in the Aegean Bronze Age 1939-1989, in press), and ceramic fabrics from Amor- gos Markiani, Melos Phylakopi, and Keros Kavos. Recent petrological studies of ceramics from Akrotiri on Thera and from Mikri Vigla on Naxos are described in the following section of this review. In addition to these, see also S.J. Vaughan, "Bronze Age Cycladic White Wares: A Question of Materials and Manufacturing Techniques," AJA 96 (1992) 342 (abstract). I thank D.E.

DAVIS [AJA 96 and Samos remain sporadic, and the material cultural assemblages in which they have been discovered are predominantly non-Minoan in character. The archae- ological picture does not, however, entirely conform to predictions that "the strength of Minoan contacts is proportional to proximity to Crete."25 Rather, there appears to have been a dramatic falloff in Minoan influence between the north and south Aegean, and even within the southern Aegean there are marked differences in the nature of Cretan influence. More than a decade ago I argued that "there existed a zone in the Western Cyclades (encompassing at least the islands of Thera, Melos, and Keos) in which there was regular exchange between Cycladic settlements and Crete."26 My argument in 1979 was that these islands had been preferentially supplied with Minoan products and that Minoan trading activities in the southern Aegean were to some extent directional (and thus purposeful). The principal settlements on Thera, Melos, and Keos were interpreted as three important ports along a "Western String" exchange route be- tween Crete and the mainland. The subsequent defi- nition of a similar "enriched" zone in the Dodecanese lends, I think, support to my proposition that one of the most important motives for such exchange was the acquisition of metals by Crete. The extent to which eastern Attica supplied the Minoan world with lead and silver has become much more clear in the past decade; copper now too can be added to the list of mineral products that reached Crete from Laurion. The sharp drop-off in evidence for Minoan contact to the north of Samos may suggest that Cretans in the eastern Aegean were also interested in the acquisition of a particular product, either one locally produced or that could be acquired through the medium of secondary distribution centers.27 This much is clear. The desire to colonize (i.e., to establish new Minoan settlements abroad) cannot have supplied the only motivation for Cretan activity in the Aegean, although it may explain archaeological evi- dence produced by recent excavations and surveys in the Dodecanese. There a remarkable increase both in the size and number of settlements occurred dur- ing the Minoan New Palace period, particularly on Rhodes, Kos, and Karpathos. These settlements were apparently established de novo on virgin soil, and there is very little evidence for preexisting non- Minoan populations. The settlements of Trianda on Rhodes and Seraglio on Kos appear to have been of substantial size from the time of their foundation. Such a pattern, and the fact that the material culture of these sites was almost entirely Minoan in character, may well reflect purposeful large-scale colonization. But such an interpretation will not explain the Minoan presence in the Cyclades. For example, it is now obvious that the settlement of Akrotiri on Thera was ancient when a Minoan presence was first felt; its history began already in the Neolithic period. Even at the time of most intense Cretan presence in the earlier stages of the Late Bronze Age, elements of the preexisting, non- Minoan, Cycladic material culture survived at Akrotiri and at contemporary centers like Phylakopi on Melos and Ayia Irini on Keos. There can be no doubt that local non-Minoan populations continued to occupy these sites, even if we allow for the possibility that one or all may have been administered by a Cretan over- lord or that Minoan elements were present in the local population. The case for actual Cretan settlement seems strongest for Thera, partly because of the re- markable divergence of its settlement pattern from what was apparently the Cycladic norm. On both Keos and Melos, recent systematic surface surveys have reinforced a picture of islands dominated by a single "primate" center; the pattern of settlement on Thera appears to have been radically different and perhaps approximated that of New Palace Crete, with its dense array of towns, villages, and villas. Such evidence does not suggest that the motivation for Minoan involvement as far north as Melos and Keos was primarily oriented toward conquest and colonization. Neither Ayia Irini nor Phylakopi seems to have expanded remarkably in size during the New Palace period and the countryside of both islands remained relatively vacant. Nor does evidence from the central and northern Cyclades attest to an expan- sion of Minoan population, although here the quality of our evidence is less adequate than in the western Cyclades.28 At present, Delos (at approximately the same latitude as Keos and Samos) is the island farthest 25 P.M.

The past decade has, however, produced new evi- dence from the central Cyclades. Finds from surface investigations at Mikri Vigla in western Naxos, al- though difficult to date with precision, document contact with Crete in the MBA and early LBA, and reinforce the picture offered by older discoveries at Alla in the southeast. Discoveries both at Grotta (the capital, or Chora, of Naxos) and, more surprisingly, on the islet of Kato Koufonisi have shown that at a time contemporary with LM I on Crete, a range of Minoan and mainland ceramics similar to those found in the so-called "Western String" was also reaching the central islands. What is missing at present is any quantified information. Thus, although we now may have a somewhat better idea of the "content" and spatial distribution of the trade network that served the central Cyclades, we still lack any measure of its magnitude. Nor is there much evidence that contact with Crete had there the same profound effect on the material culture of native non-Minoan peoples as at Akrotiri, Phylakopi, and Ayia Irini. Other arguments posed recently in support of Mi- noan political control of the Aegean purport to find their justification in historical Egyptian documents: namely, the description of Crete and the "Islands in the Middle of the Great Green" as a single entity is seen as providing evidence for Minoan hegemony.30 Ultimately, however, the conflict that has resulted in the division of many Aegean prehistorians into two camps-one of Cycladic "nationalists," the other of Minoan "imperialists"-may be unresolvable. Indeed one might well debate the wisdom of using prehistoric archaeological data for the reconstruction of political events. Nonetheless, the islands of the Aegean present an extraordinary opportunity for prehistorians inter- ested in the processes of cultural contact and change to investigate a wide range of case studies in a variety of settings. The laboratory-like benefits of archaeol- ogy on islands, in particular the well-boundedness of social units and the diversity of environments, should in the future permit us to explain in much greater detail the material consequences of the Thalassocracy of Minos. The Late Cycladic III period in the Aegean offers a similar opportunity for a synthetic comparative study of the processes by which Mycenaean material culture was adopted in the islands of the Aegean, a question largely forgotten in the recent rush to doc- ument the Minoan presence overseas. Mycenaean ma- terial culture was perhaps even more all-pervasive in the islands than was Minoan.3 But is this to be taken as evidence for the settlement of mainlanders in the islands? Many of the same issues need to be faced that are being confronted in discussion of the Minoan Thalassocracy.32 The only good stratigraphical se- quence that bridges the earlier and later parts of the LBA, that reconstructed at Ayia Irini on Keos, does not suggest any obvious gap in the settlement se- quence at the time when Mycenaean material culture came to dominate Minoan. Indeed, at that site, as in other Cycladic settlements of the early LBA, there had always existed considerable evidence for contact with the Greek mainland. The principal change that had occurred by the time of LH III was not the replacement of Minoan and Minoanized by mainland traditions, but rather the subtraction of Crete as a significant influence on local life-styles. As in the case of the Minoan Thalassocracy, in the Mycenaean empire a great amount of diversity can be recognized in the nature of the responses of individ- ual islands to contact with Mycenaean mainlanders. In the far north on Thasos, Mycenaean ceramic tra- ditions were adapted and incorporated into local ce- ramic repertories, but standard Mycenaean wares appear to have reached the island only infrequently. Within the Aegean there are differences too in burial customs. Most obvious are the large cists used for burial in LB III Chios and Psara, a sharp contrast to the chamber tombs of the Dodecanese. In Euboia and the northern Sporades, the chamber tomb appears to have been standard. The chamber tomb was also pres- ent on Naxos, while on Paros and Tinos, a variety of tholos tomb was introduced.

The forms of burial prac- ticed elsewhere, including the well-investigated island of Keos, remain a mystery. More generally, the ab- sence of evidence that large numbers of intact Myce- naean vases have been looted over the years by perspicacious archaiokapiloi may in itself suggest that burial in chamber tombs never acquired the promi- nence in many islands that it had in the Dodecanese. A REVIEW OF RECENT WORK My specific goal in this section is to summarize recent scholarship that pertains to the islands of the Aegean. Much of it will be pertinent to issues already discussed above. Readers will notice that my definition of "recent" varies from one part of the Aegean to another. Even in an extensive format, there remain certain absolute limitations on space, and it makes little sense to consider in detail literature that has already passed into more general syntheses and is readily accessible. I, therefore, assume that the reader will have ready access to the Gazetteer. For the Bronze Age Cyclades, I have not generally taken into account those publications encompassed by Barber's compre- hensive synthesis of Cycladic prehistory, The Cyclades in the Bronze Age. For other islands, I have attempted to provide an overview of significant research pub- lished since 1980.33 I have paid most attention to new fieldwork, relatively little to art historical matters. In the case of Early Cycladic art or the Thera frescoes, the literature is so vast that it warrants separate re- views.34 My references to secondary literature attempt only to epitomize a portion of recent scholarship, but I hope that I have provided readers with sufficient clues to allow them to find their way into more spe- cialized publications, should they desire to do so. I have summarized most extensively those studies that will be least accessible to readers in North America. Presentation in this section follows the current or- ganization of administrative districts within the Greek Archaeological Service, beginning with Keos in the first Ephoreia and concluding with the 22nd Ephoreia of the Dodecanese and Amorgos. Keos Work on Keos in the past decade has concentrated on publishing results of earlier excavations at the site of Ayia Irini. Seven volumes of the final excavation report have appeared, all since 1983, giving Ayia Irini the longest well-documented prehistoric sequence in the Cyclades. In addition, no less than three separate surface survey projects are providing the details of the overall prehistoric settlement system of the island. Habitation at Ayia Irini appears to have begun somewhat later than at the FN site of Kephala nearby. EBA levels at Ayia Irini were extensive but remain largely unpublished.35 Pottery from period I deposits, the earliest at Ayia Irini, is distinctly different from that from Kephala and lacks several distinctive fea- tures characteristic of that site, including pattern- burnishing and scoops, although there are general similarities in shapes, and the wares are still within a Neolithic tradition. After period I there appears to be a break in the sequence, inasmuch as period II represents a fully developed EB II phase of occupa- tion, distinguished by close relations with eastern At- tica.36 Period III is characterized by the introduction of Anatolianizing ceramic shapes (constituting about 10% of the pottery in assemblages), at least some of which were locally produced; their introduction was not marked by discontinuities in the life of the settle- ment, and continuity with previous traditions was the rule.37 In neither period is there evidence for any 3" Since many publications in Greece, particularly jour- nals, have often been published many years later than their cover date, in composing this report I decided to consider reports of fieldwork for inclusion if they were summarized in AR 27 (1981) or "Chronique" 1981 or later, even in cases where the original report abstracted had been composed many years prior. 34 Fortunately, excellent recent syntheses are readily avail- able.

These publications are rich with references to earlier studies of Cycladic art.

Wilson convincingly demonstrates that the closest parallels for the Anatolian-style pottery from Ayia Irini III are to be found in southwestern Asia Minor.

It is indeed increasingly clear that exchange played a significant role in the life of the settlement from the time of its foundation. The Middle Bronze Age at Ayia Irini has been divided into two principal periods, IV and V, the former subdivided into three subphases. The evi- dence for both periods IV and V has now been fully presented.38 There was a break in occupation at Ayia Irini after period III. The earliest period IV deposits at the site are appreciably later than the beginning of the MH period on the Greek mainland and it is clear that a gap exists in the Ayia Irini sequence roughly contemporary with EH III and the earlier stages of the Middle Bronze Age. The cemeteries of period IV are among the very few cemeteries known in the MBA Cyclades (fig. 2). From the beginning of period IV the settlement was fortified, its principal gateway guarded by a horseshoe-shaped tower. This earliest defensive system was destroyed and eventually re- placed by a system set farther north on the neck of the peninsula to encompass a somewhat larger area within the town. The construction of this new system (of large roughly squared limestone blocks with rec- tangular towers) marks the beginning of period V, which must be on the basis of Minoan imports roughly contemporary with MM IIB/MM IIIA. As in the EBA, MBA Keos was closely linked through exchange to other areas of the Aegean. Ties to Crete are evident already from the beginning of period IV, although local ceramic traditions are dominant (fig. 3). In pe- riod V, there is evidence for the local use of the Cretan linear script and for Cretan-style administrative prac- tice, as represented by a roundel of Minoan type and an inscribed tablet fragment. Aspects of material cul- ture became increasingly Minoanized in the course of the MBA (and in the earlier stages of the LBA) as local potters copied Cretan shapes and many elements of Cretan technology were introduced to the island, including a Minoan system of metrology. Crete influ- enced local religious practices, and Minoan-style wall paintings were executed locally (figs. 4-5).39 ...I. 'N :IN, i iiiiMA, Fig. 3. Ayia Irini, Keos.

(Courtesy Lyvia Morgan) As yet no overview of the settlement in any period of the LBA has appeared in the series of final exca- vation reports. Deposits from house A, published in 1983, continue to provide the most detailed picture of the nature of the material culture at the site in periods VI and VII.40 The stratigraphy of these pe- riods is now, however, understood in considerable detail as is the architectural development of the site. Two principal subgroups of material have been rec- ognized within period VI: an earlier group that con- tains LM IA types but in which the LH I style is not represented, and a later one in which the LH I style, the LM IA style, and mainland matt-painted types contemporary with LH I are represented.41 These divisions of period VI are followed by the three sub- divisions distinguishable in period VII. An early phase (VIIa), which bridges the gap between periods VI and VII, is marked by the first importation of LM IB/LH II ceramics to the site, and is earlier in date than the main destruction deposits of house A. These are in turn assigned to a middle phase of period VII (VIIb) and are characterized by the appearance of the Cretan Marine Style and the so-called Alternating Style. A late phase follows the destruction of house A but is still contemporary with the latest part of LH II (VIIc). In the early LBA, the area of houses C, F, and EJ seems to have consisted of a few independent establishments with large open spaces between them, metalworking at both Ayia Irini and Kephala has been sum- marized recently by Z.A. Stos-Gale, "Lead Isotope Evidence for Trade in Copper from Cyprus during the Late Bronze Age," in Greek Prehistory 265-82, esp. 276, 282, and fig. 13; and by Z.A. Stos-Gale and N.H.

Schofield, "Evi- dence for Household Industries on Thera and Kea," in TAW III.1, 201-11.

Davis, "The Cycladic Style of the Thera Frescoes," in TAW III.1, 214-27, and L. Morgan, "Island Iconography: Thera, Kea, Milos," in TAW III.1, 252-65. Of particular interest is Morgan's reconstruction of fragments from the northeast bastion in the fortifications of Ayia Irini as parts of a min- iature fresco, thematically related to the miniatures of the West House at Akrotiri on Thera. 40 W.W. Cummer and E. Schofield, Ayia Irini: House A (Keos III, Mainz 1983). 41 J.L. Davis and J.F. Cherry, "Spatial and Temporal Uni- formitarianism in Late Cycladic I: Perspectives from Kea and Milos on the Prehistory of Akrotiri," in TAW 111.1, 185- 200. The latest of the two period VI subphases, best repre- sented in deposit A of room 18 in house A, cannot, as recently has been argued by Warren (infra n. 152), be the result of a destruction that occurred contemporarily with the Seismic Destruction Level (SDL) at Akrotiri (on these deposits, see the discussion of Thera infra). The relevant deposits at Akrotiri produced no trace of the Late Helladic I style and were presumably deposited before its inception on the Greek mainland, while the LH I style is clearly represented in the deposit in house A. The house A deposit must, therefore, be later in date than the SDL at Akrotiri; its overall character is, in fact, more similar to that of the Volcanic Destruction Level (VDL) at Akrotiri (particularly in terms of the suite of mainland imports represented) than it is to the SDL. There can be little question that pottery of the LH I style and of contemporary matt-painted styles reached the southern Cyc- lades since mainland imports are well represented in LC I levels at Phylakopi on Melos, and are found already in the SDL at Akrotiri (infra n. 153). Once again, the danger of drawing suppositious correlations needs to be emphasized.</page><page sequence="13">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 711 - ;.; .. ....... . ."-.......................... --......... ??-------?---- ------------?---------- ?--- .r .. ... r - J . ........... . . .. i ; . . . .. .. .. ... .. . . . - ....................... .

LH IIIA: 1 material from most parts of the site appears to have been laid down as the result of an- other widespread destruction. Deposits from several different parts of the site indicate continuation of settlement in LH IIIA:2 as do remains of structures built outside the fortifications near the former (period VII) main gateway to the town. Continued use of burnished and matt-painted wares in LH IIIA: 1, and of conical cups and tripod cooking pots, attests to the survival of these types into LH III alongside Myce- naean types proper; there is strong continuity in local ceramic traditions. One objective of a recent systematic surface survey (1983-1984) in northwest Keos was to determine the character of settlement and land use in the immediate hinterland of Ayia Irini.44 Results suggest that Keos may have followed a rather different pattern of de- 42 For preliminary observations on the character of period VII subphases, see E.

DAVIS [AJA 96 velopment in the EBA than did many other Cycladic islands. The population of the island (at least of its northwest part) appears to have been concentrated at the site of Ayia Irini alone and there is no Keian parallel to the scatter of small EC settlements and cemeteries recognized on so many other islands. Evi- dence available from two other surveys that have ranged more extensively supports our hypothesis that the settlement at Ayia Irini dominated the settlement system of Keos as a whole.45 Other sites are both tiny in size and lack evidence for the imported ceramic wares that bear such vivid testimony to the interaction between Ayia Irini and the outside world. No pottery earlier than that at Kephala and Paoura has been recognized, nor has survey located material that might be employed to close gaps in the Ayia Irini sequence between periods I and II, and between periods III and IV. Finds of the late Middle and early Late Cy- cladic periods are most plentiful, but these are almost exclusively the remains of large storage jars and other coarse wares that were perhaps employed in rural settings by a population largely resident at Ayia Irini itself. LB III finds have been especially scarce. Survey results have cast most light on Neolithic Keos. Detailed collection of surface materials at Paoura and Kephala has allowed the size of those sites to be estimated with greater precision. Analysis of lithics from both suggests that Paoura's closest ties are with Saliagos; the assemblage of Kephala is distinct from that of Paoura and its lithics have strong affini- ties with those of mainland sites. Paoura may well have supported a population of 75-130 individuals, while Kephala was certainly a village of considerably smaller scale. Two new small aceramic sites in the northwest part of the island near Kephala have been assigned to the later Neolithic period on the basis of lithic attributes.46 Mineralogical field study has succeeded in relocat- ing sources of lead ore, long known to exist on the island and mined for a short time in the later 19th and early 20th centuries. The deposits are distinguish- able from those of Laurion on the basis of their lead- isotope ratios and are low in silver content. There is as yet no firm evidence that they were exploited in prehistoric times.47 The Northern Sporades The principal development in the prehistory of the northern Sporades has been the publication of results of excavations at the site of Ayios Petros.48 The site lies inside a large bay on the southwest side of the islet of Kyra Panayia. In the Neolithic Ayios Petros was attached to the adjacent mainland of Kyra Pan- ayia, but even during the Palaeolithic there appears to have existed a sea lane between it and the island of Alonnisos to the southwest.49 Most of the site is now submerged but even originally it seems to have been less than two-tenths of a hectare in area. Stratification was shallow (only a little more than a meter in depth) and much eroded but nonetheless excavation pro- duced conclusive evidence that the principal period of occupation was contemporary with the latter part of the EN period and the beginning of the MN period in Thessaly; 14C dates of 6740 + 120 B.P. and 5860 + 400 B.P. have been published.5? Some LN, EBA (of 45 Thus far the results of extensive survey by H.S. Geor- giou and N. Faraklas in the northern part of the island have been published; see H.S. Georgiou and N. Faraklas, "Ancient Habitation Patterns of Keos: Locations and Nature of Sites on the Northwest Part of the Island," Ariadni 3 (1985) 207- 66. Survey teams from the University of Athens have oper- ated principally in the territories of the Classical city-states of Poieessa and Karthaia. For specifically prehistoric finds, see G. Galani, L. Mendoni, and H. Papayeoryiadou, "EitL- aLveClaxl EQUvva oTilv K~ca," Arhaiognosia 3 (1982-1984) 237-44. 46 L.E. Talalay, "Body Imagery of the Ancient Aegean," Archaeology 44:4 (1991) 46-49, has also discussed the char- acter of settlement at Kephala, the control of local resources, and the relationship between cemeteries and territorial def- inition. For the most authoritative recent discussion of Ke- phala and nearby sites, see R. Torrence, "The Chipped Stone," 173-98, and T.M.

Survey of Kyra Panayia by Efstratiou revealed no additional prehistoric finds; see also "First Colonization" 167, for further discus- sion of sea level fluctuations and of the possibility that the northern Sporades were tied to each other and the adjacent mainland during the Palaeolithic. 50 Efstratiou (supra n. 49) 167, appendix V; S.G.E.

Efstratiou argues that there are parallels at Ayios Petros with ceramics of the second phase of Thessalian EN (Achilleion phase). These elements could not, however, be defined at Ayios Petros as a distinct stage in the life of the settlement, but were found together with ceramic elements of the sort that characterize the classic MN Sesklo phase in Thessaly.</page><page sequence="15">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 713 Troy I character), and MBA (Gray Minyan) pottery in surface levels and in a pit reflect later use.51 Pa- laeolithic artifacts have been reported at Ayios Petros and at several locations on Alonnisos. Stone foundations for structures with both rectan- gular and curving walls appear to have supported mudbrick superstructures. Two child burials were excavated amidst the habitation levels while other human bones were found scattered. Artifactual evi- dence does not suggest that those who used the site of Ayios Petros were particularly isolated from adja- cent mainlands. Nearly all of the pottery appears to have been produced locally, but stylistic affinities in- dicate continuing contact with the Thessalian main- land. Most distinctive are carinated bowls with red- patterned decoration on a creamy ground. Imported materials include Melian obsidian and flint that ap- pears to have been Thessalian in origin. The stone used for axes, on the other hand, was probably of local derivation, quarried on the island of Psathoura, to the north of Kyra Panayia. The extensive collection of terracotta figurines (50 in number) from the site is noteworthy given the fact that most are from secure contexts; they include male as well as female and animal types. Features are for the most part rendered with deep incisions, some with white filling. Animal bones include a full range of domesticates. It is con- vincingly argued that the site was most likely a per- manent, rather than a seasonal, occupation; if this interpretation is correct, Ayios Petros would be the earliest published permanent settlement yet known in the Aegean islands. Euboia and Skyros Euboia. Our picture of earliest settlement on Euboia has been greatly illuminated by the publication of the results of recent surveys and excavations designed to supplement older investigations by Theoharis and by members of the British and American Schools at Ath- ens.52 More than 60 Neolithic and EB I sites are now known, for the most part small settlements of limited duration. Analysis particularly of finds from the sites of Psahna Varka, Psahna Glyfa, Psahna Votsika, Eretria Seinen Mnima, Politika Spilaio Marmara, Karystos Plakari, and Chalkis Manika have allowed the earlier prehistory of the island to be divided into six tentative phases: an Older (AQXat6lTQr) Neolithic I and II (roughly coincident with EN on the mainland); a Newer (NErrEQrg) Neolithic I, approximately equiva- lent with the earlier phases of the mainland LN; two stages of Final Neolithic (the latest equivalent to the Attic-Kephala culture); and EH I.53 No Euboian phase corresponding in character to mainland MN has yet been noted. Each of these stages is defined with ref- erence to characteristic ceramic and lithic artifacts, and to patterns in settlement.54 Surface survey has 51 Efstratiou (supra n. 49) 166, appendix IV, reports pro- visional results of spectroscopic analyses of samples of Gray Minyan pottery that suggest that, in their composition, they resemble most closely the Mycenaean pottery of Volos in Thessaly.

Most of these Euboian sites appear to have been settlements, although human bones from Politika Spilaio Marmara are of the Older Neolithic II phase and presumably derive from a burial. Older Neolithic I sites are poorly known and the character of the ceramics suggests isolation from mainland traditions. Pre-Neolithic finds have also been reported on Euboia; see Neolithic and Protohelladic 23; "First Colonization" 165- 67. For other recent reports of pre-Neolithic finds from the island, see A. Sampson, "a-IclcEica AyLwvvag," ArchDelt 38 B' (1983) 154 (Middle Palaeolithic at Aiyianna Sarakeniko); "KeQcao(La," ArchDelt 38 B' (1983) 155 (pre-Neolithic stone tools at Kerasia Panayia and Kerasia Nero); E.

DAVIS [AJA 96 been most extensive in central Euboia and it is not surprising that the area around Eretria and Chalkis is best represented by newly discovered sites. The greatest numbers of sites appear to belong to the Final Neolithic and EH I periods; these seem to have been times of settlement expansion. All parts of the island were inhabited, including inland and coastal locations in the north and south.55 For the EBA as a whole more than a hundred sites are now known from ex- cavation or surface investigations.56 As for the Neo- lithic, these are concentrated in the central parts of the island. The most intensively surveyed part of Euboia is the area around the bay of Karystos in the south.57 The entirety of the Paximadi peninsula southwest of Kar- ystos has now been investigated, and 19 concentra- tions of prehistoric material have been recognized. All belong to the Final Neolithic and early part of the Early Bronze Age. The focus of settlements appears to have been in the north of the peninsula, where flat land and water are more accessible. The earliest re- mains yet located in southern Euboia belong to the Late Neolithic and come from the cave of Ayia Triada, north of Karystos; they include obsidian and black- burnished pottery.58 Fragments of human bone sug- gest that the cave may have been used as a place of burial, while just below it LN and FN habitation re- mains have been discovered in several rock-shelters. West of Karystos, FN finds have been recorded at two locations: a small site on the summit of the Kazara ridge and a larger settlement on the ridge of Plakari, both in defensible positions a short distance from the sea. Limited salvage excavations at Plakari have un- covered architectural remains with pattern-burnished pottery similar in character to that from Kephala on Keos.59 In contrast, several EBA sites were located on the shore of the Paximadi peninsula: Ayia Pelayia on the northeast side,60 Ayia Paraskevi at the south end, and Akri Rozos on the northwest. On the east side of the bay of Karystos another EBA site was found at Ayia Irini. Finds of the MBA and LBA in contrast are relatively scarce here in the extreme south of Euboia. A large site was established in the MBA to the northeast of Karystos at Ayios Nikolaos; finds include plentiful evidence for metalworking, Gray Minyan and matt- painted pottery, bronze artifacts, and a lead pottery clamp. The settlement was apparently not inhabited in the LBA and as yet there have been no indisputable LBA finds reported in southern Euboia.61 In addition to the preceding general surveys and trials, more extensive excavations have been pursued at several locations. The most important of these have been at the apparently massive EBA site of Chalkis 55 The distribution of sites by date (as summarized in Neolithic and Protohelladic) is as follows: Older Neolithic I, 9; Older Neolithic II, 8; Newer Neolithic I, 15; FN I, 4; FN II, 18; EH I, 23. These figures are now supplemented by more recent data, particularly that from survey in southern Euboia (infra ns. 57, 61). 56 Manika I, 334-76 summarizes much of the evidence and includes commentary on a catalogue of EBA sites; many new sites have been identified since earlier investigations by Theoharis and by members of the British and American Schools. See also a report of EH II remains at Drosia Gai- daros: A. Sampson, "AQoomd," ArchDelt 38 B' (1983) 154. Kalligas has provided a detailed review of prehistoric re- search on the island before the 1980s: P.G. Kalligas, "Euboea and the Cyclades," in Cycladica 88-98, and publishes a num- ber of older finds including a marble figurine from Makro- horifo, just south of Chalkis; he also discusses various Neolithic and EBA artifacts thought to come from the vicin- ity of Makrikapa, in east-central Euboia (including gold and silver vessels); most are now in the collections of the Chalkis Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Benaki Museum (see E.

The presence of copper ore from the site is noted by Keller and Cullen (infra n. 61). All obsidian probably originated on Melos and the raw material does not seem to have been used in an econom- ical fashion. Unworked nodules of obsidian appear to have been imported directly from Melos and are most plentiful on Cape Mnima, at the southern tip of the peninsula. 60 Highly diagnostic EB II types, including sauceboats, found at Ayia Pelayia, represent the latest stage of Bronze Age occupation yet recognized on the Paximadi peninsula (Keller and Cullen, infra n. 61). 61 Since 1984, the Canadian Karystia Expedition has com- pleted survey of the Paximadi peninsula and parts of the southeastern coast of the island.

The existence of prehistoric remains in the Skoteini Cave has long been known. Excavations since 1986 have, however, uncovered stratified deposits, which, when published, promise to clarify considerably the Late and Final Neolithic sequence of Euboia.62 The earliest traces of human presence can be dated to Newer Neolithic I in the Euboian sequence (equiva- lent to early LN on the mainland); higher strata are of Final Neolithic, Early Helladic, and LH III date.

Some 400 m from the cave the remains of a badly eroded Neolithic cemetery has been exca- vated, including eight slab-built graves (four intact); multiple burial of skulls suggests the practice of sec- ondary burial in two of these. Remains of an open- air FN settlement have also been excavated on a pla- teau above the cave. The site of Manika, north of the Euripos near Chalkis, has been the target of especially intensive investigation. Although long known, only in the course of the past decade has the true extent and importance of Manika begun to be clarified.63 Recent investigations have focused on the EBA community although it is clear that the settlement continued to be inhabited in the MBA and LBA (fig. 8). The earliest strata are dated to a stage late in EH I. Most architec- tural remains are contemporary with EH II on the Greek mainland. The final major stage of EBA oc- cupation, less widespread than the preceding EH II phase, belongs to the so-called Lefkandi I phase and is characterized by Anatolian elements in ceramics and metallurgy; after this the settlement appears to have been further reduced in size. The cause of this diminution is unclear: no obvious evidence for de- struction either by human or natural forces has yet 63 For earlier research see Kalligas (supra n. 56).

There is also an extensive discussion of the ground stone industry in Manika II, 80-104. The extremely detailed presentation of excavations in the Zousis plot describes complexes of rectangular and apsidal rooms, some of which appear to have had two stories (122- 24, 131-32). The pottery has been extensively described. Extraordinary finds included a bronze ring with incised decoration on its bezel (109, 224-26, no. 425), a terracotta "teddy-bear" (140, no. 9), stone vessels (217-18, nos. 388- 92), stone pestles (218-19, nos. 393-94), a stone pebble figurine (141, no. 9), a terracotta quadruped figurine (140, no. 10), two bronze chisels (224, nos. 423-24), a stamp seal (266, no. 427), and a leg from a terracotta anthropomorphic figurine (266, no. 428). Few terracotta whorls and no loom- weights were found. Ground stone and obsidian chipped stone tools were common (220-24, 226-34).</page><page sequence="19">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 717 Fig. 9. Manika, Euboia. Fragment of frying pan with impressed decoration. (Cour- tesy Efi Sakellaraki) been identified. There had previously been a continu- ity in architecture, ceramics, and burial customs at Manika; the settlement of the Lefkandi I phase did not represent a major break with previous traditions. Indeed, Anatolian types are most often found in fu- nerary contexts (and even there are not common); they, like Cycladic imports in earlier stages of the EBA, appear to have been selectively chosen as grave gifts because of their prestige value as exotica. More common imported goods include Melian obsidian, and andesite, which was used for the manufacture of a substantial portion of all ground stone tools. The biggest surprise of recent years has been the suggestion of the enormity of the size of Manika. In 1985, its maximum extent was estimated at 45-50 ha, but this estimate has recently been revised upward to about 80 ha.64 From the results of augering and re- mote sensing, it has been suggested that areas situated between the various soundings that define the maxi- mum extent of the settlement were compactly settled. Even if we may assume, as seems likely, that settlement was not contemporary in all parts of the site, Manika must have been one of the largest settlements in the Aegean in the EBA; it is certainly the only pre-palatial island settlement with a claim to rival contemporary Anatolian and Near Eastern centers in its scale.65 It has also been argued that the settlement from its initial stages was, in some sense of the word, "organized": 64 See H. Marukian, E. Kambouroglou, and A. Sampson, "Coastal Evolution and Archaeology North and South of Chalkis in the Last 5000 Years," in A. Raban ed., Archaeology of Coastal Changes (BAR-IS 404, Oxford 1988) 71-79. See also Sakellaraki, ArchDelt 41 (supra n. 63) 103, regarding the extent of the settlement. 65 Estimates for sizes of many principal EBA sites on Crete are an order of magnitude smaller (T.M. Whitelaw, "The Settlement at Fournou Korifi, Myrtos and Aspects of Early Minoan Social Organization," in O. Krzyszkowska and L. Nixon eds., Minoan Society [Bristol 1983] 339). The largest mainland sites are generally smaller than 4 ha (see D. Kon- sola, H rod)tt,1kP aOrtmozroolo0 oarovg wro7oeAAa6txOog otxtaroPgo [Athens 1984] 94-102). In the Cyclades, settle- ments were still smaller (C. Broodbank, "The Longboat and Society in the Cyclades in the Keros-Syros Culture," AJA 93 [1989] 319-37). Nor were there habitations in the northern Aegean that approached Manika in size (C. Renfrew, The Emergence of Civilisation [London 1972] 236-44). For esti- mates of sizes for Near Eastern and Anatolian sites, see also Renfrew.</page><page sequence="20">718 JACK L. DAVIS [AJA 96 that all architectural remains thus far explored are oriented to the cardinal points and take their cue from similarly aligned streets.66 The town may also have been fortified.67 The cemetery of Manika lay to the south, adjacent to the settlement; its maximum extent has not yet been determined with certainty, but it appears to have covered at least 6 ha.68 Within this area, the density of tombs varies; many appear to be grouped in clus- ters. Approximately 200 tombs with inhumation bur- ials have thus far been investigated: burial chambers of varying sizes cut into the bedrock were entered via shaft-like antechambers, some with steps leading down from ground level; slabs or built walls blocked passage into the main chamber. The state of preser- vation of most of the human remains is poor but adequate for certain generalizations about the nature of burial customs. Bodies were placed into the tombs in contracted positions. It is possible that some tombs never held more than a single burial, but most con- tained multiple burials. The earlier burials were swept aside when necessary to make room for additions; sand or pebbles were sometimes used to separate layers of older bone from newer. Other graves appear to have been employed as ossuaries. Traces of burning inside some tombs reflect burial ritual. Cycladic and Anatolian types of pottery are both found with some frequency: frying pans are especially common (fig. 9), recovered in over 20 graves.69 Types such as sauce- boats, especially common in settlement levels, are rarely found in the cemetery. These newly excavated graves and buildings pro- vide clearer contexts for a number of EBA artifact types that had not been well documented in excavated contexts. Scientific analyses have shown that bone tubes of Cycladic type with incised decoration once contained azurite, presumably used as a paint.70 More than 10 anthropomorphic figurines of marble and of bone or shell have thus far been reported (figs. 10- 4 iijiii Fig. 10. Manika, Euboia. Marble figurine. (Courtesy Efi Sak- ellaraki) 11); terracotta figurines, and both terracotta and stone zoomorphic vessels are also represented.

The 50-odd artifacts consist of both silver and bronze, and include a curved knife, chisels, pins with pyramidal, conical, spherical, dou- ble-spiral, and roll-tops, tweezers, a cosmetic scraper, razors, rings, necklaces, and bangles. A number of these types find closest typological parallels in the eastern Aegean and in Anatolia.72 Of three stone seals, one has a spiral, another, a leaf-shape imprint, and the third, a geometric design.73 Rescue excavations at Classical Eretria in the Vour- atsas plot, near the northeast corner of the later agora, have recovered deep prehistoric deposits extending well beneath the level of the water table. Finds re- portedly date to the later phases of EH and to the beginning of the MBA, and there is a thin overlying stratum containing Minyan, Minoan, LH IIIB, and LH IIIC types. The greater part of the pottery may be dated to EH II, EH III, and early MH; proto- Minyan handmade bowls are well represented. The earlier finds were associated with architectural re- mains, including a storeroom that still contained a 15- cm thick stratum of carbonized grains and pulses on its floor. A well-preserved potter's kiln has been now moved to the Eretria Museum.74 The exact date of the kiln is not entirely certain, since excavation be- neath the water table made it impossible to record detailed stratigraphy, but it is clear that it is earlier than the Geometric period and much of the associated pottery was of EH types. The prehistoric settlement explored by tests in the Vouratsas plot probably lay on a low headland by the sea. Excavations on the acropolis of Eretria have also yielded prehistoric finds. Most of the prehistoric pot- tery recovered there may, however, have been incor- porated within mudbricks, subsequently decayed, and reused after the Bronze Age for fill, particularly for the core of the northeast tower of the fortifications. Finds from the acropolis belong mainly to the later stages of the Middle Helladic period and the Late Bronze Age (only LH IIIA-C is definitely attested). Elsewhere, in an area close to the western circuit of the historical city wall, Neolithic stone axes have been reported.75 Several other sites on Euboia have been explored through more limited excavation; results have not yet been published in detail.

(Courtesy Adamantios Sampson) Euboia east of Chalkis, most of a small EH-MH site at Fylla Kaloyerovrysi has been explored (fig. 12). Both rectangular and apsidal buildings were associated with EH levels; obsidian was notably rare as was fine Ur- firnis pottery, surprising given the proximity of the site to Chalkis Manika. MH buildings of two different phases lay above the EH levels; the highest phase is reported to date to the transitional period between the Middle and Late Bronze Age. MH cist graves and the remains of a plundered shaft grave of early LH date were excavated among the MH buildings.76 In the northwest part of the island a second MH settlement was investigated at Aidipsou Koumbi. Foundations of two separate late MH buildings were found stratified over an earlier MH structure; on the floor of the latter was a thick burnt layer. Beneath it was a cist grave, also of MH date." Within the limits of the inland mountain village of Avlonari Ayios Yior- yios in the east-central part of the island, south of ancient Kyme, excavations have uncovered an EH II ossuary, consisting of a rectangular built tomb that had been covered with slabs and contained parts of two to three dozen disarticulated incomplete human skeletons; among the grave goods was a marble bowl of Cycladic type. Remains of a pillaged Mycenaean chamber tomb were also investigated nearby.78 At Mourteri on the south side of the gulf of Kyme, two buildings have been excavated, one rectangular, the other apsidal; the pottery was exclusively of EH II, and obsidian was noticeably scarce among the non- ceramic finds.79 At Amarynthos on the coast in the west central part of the island, excavation has pro- duced Neolithic, EBA, MBA, and LBA finds; parts of buildings and a section of a possible fortification wall of the Early Helladic period have been explored.80 Most recently, abundant EB, MB, and LB finds were recovered in renewed tests.81 At Linovrochi, a coastal site east of Lefkandi, the construction of irrigation facilities uncovered structures of EH I and II; subse- quent archaeological investigations revealed part of a probable apsidal building.82 Elsewhere on the island, a figurine and vase were found in a grave at Eretria 76 See A.

The prehistoric antiquities of the island of Skyros have been extensively investigated in recent years. All archaeological bibliography relevant to the island has been synthesized, and artifacts from un- published excavations have been described and illus- trated as have various prehistoric chance finds in the collection of the local museum.86 Skyros seems to have been most extensively settled in the EBA; 10 sites with characteristic EBA pottery have been identified. All are in the more fertile northwest part of the island, three along a coastal strip near the modern capital, the only part of Skyros where there is evidence for continuity in habitation between the Neolithic and Bronze Age.s7 Parlama postulates two separate foci of residence at the Chora in the EBA, one on the acrop- olis above the modern town, the other north along the coast; complete vases turned over to museum authorities suggest that there were EBA cemeteries in at least four nearby locations. Several vases find close parallels in the Cyclades, as does a pair of bone tubes with incised triangles and herringbone pattern. A fragment of a schematic marble figurine of "violin" type comes from the tiny island of Atsitsa, just off the northwest coast.88 In addition to this program of surface reconnais- sance and recapitulation, excavations have been started at the most promising of the EBA sites, a low peninsula called Palamari, which lies on the northeast coast of the island and faces toward the islands of Ayios Efstratios and Limnos. Reports have summa- rized results of field campaigns in 1981, 1985, and 1986.89 Remains of architecture observable on the surface suggest that the site was quite large, on the order of 10 ha; of this, an area of ca. 260 m2 has thus far been excavated. Some traces of possible defenses on the neck of the peninsula are of uncertain date. Within the town, the buildings appear to have been built entirely of stone with roofs of schist slabs. A series of important stratified habitation deposits appear to range in date from EB II through the beginning of the MBA, and EH I pottery has been observed in excavated surface levels and in surface collections.90 The earliest architectural remains yet investigated are associated with pottery that contains a mixture of Helladic and Cycladic elements, as at Ayia Irini on Keos farther south. There are glazed sauceboats and saucers, but also sherds with Kerb- schnitt and other impressed patterns. In the following phase of occupation, the sauceboats continue but An- atolian types are present, as in phase I of Lefkandi and in period III at Ayia Irini. In one instance the Anatolianizing deposits are overlain by house Alpha, which itself contained gray-burnished wares and part of a possible duck-vase with incised decoration that 83 Manika II, 123, pl. 162; Manika I, 364; Sakellaraki (supra n. 71) 3, 5, fig. 2, 11, no. 2, pl. 2.2 and pl. 1.3 for a schematic figurine and a vase found with it. 84 For Petries, see Manika II, 120, pl. 160.

DAVIS [AJA 96 finds its closest parallels in Phylakopi 1.2. Red-bur- nished bowls, which can be paralleled both in Troy V and in the Middle Cycladic period, were recovered from a pit dug into Anatolianizing deposits before the construction of house Alpha.91 Immediately to the west, in house Gamma, Anatolianizing types were excavated on a floor beneath the main deposit of the house, which contained ajug of Phylakopi I type, with pottery, including a relief-decorated "face-pot" that is said to find its closest parallels in Troy IV-V and the "brown" phase of Poliochni. House Gamma is also of interest for its architecture and non-ceramic contents. Its one fully explored room has stone-built interior fixtures that include a raised platform, a bin, and a hearth; various storage jars, querns, and handstones, all in a good state of preservation, suggest that the building was aban- doned in haste. Metal artifacts include a piece of lead sheeting and a roll-top pin of bronze; metals also appear to have been worked at the site. There are few traces of Middle Bronze Age activity later in date than the abandonment of the settlement at Palamari: only a handful of badly worn sherds from Atsitsa have possible parallels among the Minoan and Minoanizing shapes of Ayia Irini period V, and can be added to the Minyan and matt-painted sherds noted years ago at Papa tou Houma. Documentation is similarly in short supply for the earlier phases of the LBA. Of 100 Mycenaean vases now in the museum of Skyros (all but one with some recorded findspot), none is earlier in date than LH IIIA:2. Virtually all of these vases were found in the vicinity of the modern Chora and probably derive from tombs in cemeteries that existed north, south, and east of its acropolis. No unplundered tomb has yet been excavated but like the looted tombs investigated by Theoharis at Krokos, most are likely to have been chamber tombs of stan- dard Mycenaean type.92 Evidence of a Mycenaean presence elsewhere on Skyros is meager. Thasos A review of the prehistory of the island with a gazetteer of prehistoric sites has recently been pub- lished.93 The Neolithic of the island remains poorly known and unrepresented in excavations. Late Neo- lithic ceramic types of the sort characteristic in Mac- edonia have been recognized as have white-painted dark-ground types evocative of the southern Aegean. Links with Macedonia continued in the EBA, but the MBA is a blank. The most significant Bronze Age center on Thasos is at Theologos Kastri, a naturally fortified plateau in the southwestern part of the island. Some 300 m2 of the settlement have been excavated; contemporary stone-built tombs in ceme- teries nearby at Tsiganadika, Vrysoudes, and Kentria contained local imitation Mycenaean pottery and weapons, knives, and tools that also find antecedents in the south. The burials for the most part contained multiple inhumations although cremations are also represented. The analysis of finds from these graves suggests local mining and metalworking already by the end of the LBA.94 Since 1986 the small site of Skala Sotiros Profitis Elias, located on a small hill in the northwest part of the island, within the village of Skala Sotiros, has been explored. There, immediately beneath building levels of the sixth to fourth century B.C., are remains of a small (ca. 1400 m2 in extent) habitation of the EBA, surrounded by a fortification wall, the earliest phase of which was built in part with masonry of herring- bone style.95 Excavations inside the fortifications have yielded the remains of several buildings. Floors asso- ciated with a structure destroyed in a conflagration contained numerous complete pots, some filled with the remains of carbonized seeds (mostly legumes), 91 For the fullest discussion of the stratigraphy of houses A and B, see Parlama (supra n. 89) 124-26. The exact chronology of these post-Lefkandi I groups remains to be sorted out. It is important to note that thus far no EH III painted wares have been published from the site. 92 Parlama (supra n. 86) 136, also reports unverified local testimony that suggests the existence on Skyros of large cist graves of the variety found on Psara in the Mycenaean period. 93 C.

Wagner, "Thasos als Roh- stoffquelle fuir Bunt- und Edelmetalle im Altertum," in Wag- ner and Weisgerber (supra n. 93) 224-31, suggest the possibility that local iron and copper were also being worked at the end of the Bronze Age on Thasos. Matsas (infra n. 100) mentions gold objects, probably of local metal, from latest LBA graves at Kastri as well as evidence for the work- ing of local copper in the Chalcolithic phases of the settle- ment at Kastri. Analysis of lead artifacts from graves at Kastri points to compositions compatible with those of Thasian ores: see E. Pernicka, G.A. Wagner, and W.

These deposits appear to mark the end of the EBA settlement; by that time the circuit was no longer serving a defensive function. From an older phase of habitation, two fragments of a stele in local schist and decorated in relief with the figure of a warrior have been retrieved, both reused as building material in the earliest phase of the western peribolos of the settlement. The head of the warrior was engraved with shallow incision; he wears a necklace, holds his right hand raised to his breast, and grasps a dagger in his left; set obliquely to his chest is a spear and a double-bladed axe is stuck through his broad belt. The closest parallels for this stele are in Troy I. Sev- eral fragmentary anthropomorphic schematic marble figurines, and parts of two others that were reused as building material within the circuit wall of the settle- ment, also find their closest parallels at Troy. These finds clearly predate construction of the peribolos but thus far soundings have failed to recognize earlier habitation levels. Parallels for ceramics from the ear- lier levels of Skala Sotiros are with Troy I, Sitagroi Va, and Emborio IV-V, from the later levels with Troy II-IV and later phases of the Macedonian EBA. Finds other than pottery from the excavations include obsidian, several metal objects, and a gold button- shaped ornament. Elsewhere, in the southwest part of the island, at the site of Limenaria Tsines, two hematite mines (of some 15-20 in the vicinity) are thought to be prehis- toric in date: handmade pottery, some of it Neolithic, has been found at the mouth of one mine and appears to postdate the mining. Bone and stone tools have been found in both mines and appear to have been employed for the extraction of minerals; the presence of horn from the Saiga antelope, extinct before the Neolithic, and the absence of bones from domestic species suggest that the mines were principally worked in the Palaeolithic, and dates of 15,000- 12,000 B.C. have been advanced.96 If correct, these would be the oldest underground mines yet docu- mented in Europe; Thasos would still have been at- tached to the adjacent mainland at this time. Samothrace Investigation of prehistoric Samothrace began in 1974 following rescue excavations on the coast south- west of modern Chora, at the site of Mikro Vouni; a wider program of regional survey, geological investi- gation, and ethnography has followed.97 Systematic survey elsewhere on Samothrace suggests that the settlement pattern in the Bronze Age was character- ized by a high degree of nucleation. Mikro Vouni itself appears to have been a narrow-necked peninsula in prehistoric times. Excavations have thus far inves- tigated levels of the FN, the earlier phases of the EBA, and of LH III; one sounding is nearly 8 m deep.98 Nine phases of construction have been recognized, and surface collection suggests that the settlement was approximately 1 ha in extent. The earliest material from Mikro Vouni is compared with that of Kum Tepe la and Ib, Poliochni "black," and Emborio VII- VI; the latest, to the middle phases of Troy VI.99 The very recent announcement of Minoan docu- ments, found amid destruction debris (including frag- ments of white plaster with red decoration) in the penultimate architectural phase of the site, is partic- ularly exciting.'00 These include a roundel and a nod- ule of types well known in Crete and generally found in administrative contexts. The Samothracian roundel may be of local clay, and was stamped repeatedly around its edges with a Minoan "cushion" sealstone engraved with Cretan hieroglyphic signs; it perhaps had Linear A signs written in ink on one side.

A sounding beneath the Helle- nistic cemetery of ancient Mithymna on Lesbos reached prehistoric levels for the first time.102 Also of interest is the publication of a single Neolithic sherd, perhaps from the site of Halakies in the south of the island.'03 On Limnos, continuing excavations, begun at the site of Myrina Riha Nera in 1986, have uncov- ered in several soundings parts of a complex of EBA buildings with at least three phases of habitation; associated finds are said to be contemporary with the "yellow" and "green" phases of Poliochni.104 At Po- liochni itself restoration work has clarified some de- tails of the architectural history of the prehistoric settlement. 105 Of more interest than the results of new excavations are those offered by recent metallurgical analyses of EBA finds from older excavations at Poliochni on Limnos and at Thermi on Lesbos.o06 Of 33 objects available for analysis from Thermi (phases III-V), only three included tin as a constituent. In the longer- lived settlement of Poliochni, among 74 samples an- alyzed (from the "blue" to "yellow" phases), the quan- tity of tin bronzes was found to increase throughout the life of the settlement, reaching more than 50% by the "yellow" phase. Arsenic was used alternatively with tin as an alloy to produce bronze; tin in one example from Thermi appears to have been alloyed with iron (the well-known "tin bangle" from period IV, the earliest Aegean artifact in which tin is the principal constituent). In several instances at Thermi, brasses were also identified. For the most part, the isotopic signatures of the lead contained in the copper from which unalloyed copper artifacts and arsenic bronzes were fashioned are the same as those from contemporary artifacts found in the Troad and at Yortan. Deposits in north- west Anatolia may be the most probable candidates for the source of the copper. Lead-isotope ratios ap- pear to rule out Laurion as the source for even a single artifact of those from the "yellow" phase at Poliochni. The majority of copper-based artifacts that have an isotopic signature compatible with those of Aegean ores have incompatible chemical composi- tions. Chemical and lead isotopic analyses of artifacts from both Thermi and Poliochni suggest, however, that tin bronze was not invented or produced in the north Aegean. Tin bronze appears to have been ex- ported to the northeast Aegean from a source as yet unknown. Imported tin does not appear to have been added to copper from sources that had previously been used locally either unalloyed or alloyed with arsenic. The fact that these "local" sources continued to be exploited after tin bronze had become wide- spread suggests that the EB II period was a time when copper became available from a broader geographical range of deposits. Of the five silver objects from Poliochni that have been examined (including a double spiral-headed pin from the "blue" period, probably the earliest well- stratified silver artifact from the Aegean), all are of pure metal; they are not from the same ore and appear to have been extracted by cupellation.'07 Lev- els of silver were found to be so high in lead objects that it is clear that the lead had not been desilvered. The isotope ratio of the silver pin suggests that the silver from which it was made came from outside the Aegean area; of the other objects, some are compati- ble with Laurion and Siphnian isotopic fingerprints.

Thus the types of metal used for bronze artifacts of Ana- tolian types at the site of Kastri on Syros can be tentatively dated to Troy IIg, providing support for the contemporaneity of the Kastri I phase in the Cyclades with EB II at Troy. Chios. The final publication of the results of exca- vations at the prehistoric site of Emborio in south- eastern Chios (1952-1955), the best anchorage between the Chora of the island and Kato Fana, and at Ayio Gala in the northwest (1938) has provided for the eastern Aegean a well-documented sequence of levels spanning the Later Neolithic and EBA.s08 Ten periods, numbered from top to bottom, were defined on the basis of excavated deposits: period I, the latest of the EBA periods, is contemporary with Troy II; period VII ceramics have close parallels in FN mate- rial at Kephala on Keos;'09 and period X corresponds to an early phase of the mainland Greek Late Neo- lithic. Still earlier material lay beneath the water table and was not investigated. Wheelmade pottery was first introduced in period I, along with an Anatolian tan- kard shape that is closely paralleled in the Cyclades among ceramics of the Kastri Group. MBA and LBA finds were not assigned to periods. The deepest and earliest stratified sequence of de- posits at Emborio was excavated in area A, on flat ground northwest of the acropolis between it and the historical Greek sanctuary. EBA, as well as LBA, de- posits were also explored at the northern edge of the acropolis, and on its western ascent. In the EBA the minimum extent of the settlement has been estimated at approximately 3 ha. Before the EBA the settlement may not have included the acropolis itself. Slopes southwest of the acropolis served as a cemetery: a rock-cut EBA tomb and two Mycenaean cist graves were found in trials.11"0 Architectural remains were for the most part scrappy, although there were substantial stone walls even in the lowest stratum (period X) reached in area A; human skulls were found buried beneath one floor of period X. An adolescent had also been buried beneath a wall of a room that dated to period VIII. A spring in area A was later converted into a well, and was finally abandoned only in period II. At the end of period IV, the settlement appears to have been destroyed by fire at a time approximately contempo- rary with the earlier stages of the Aegean EBA; this is the only evidence of violent destruction recognized at Emborio. After the destruction, the ruins of the destroyed houses were deliberately filled with stones to build a level platform, which ultimately supported the foundations of period II houses. For the most part, finds later than the EBA were found only in mixed levels. Burnished gray wares and matt-painted types were both represented. Most of the gray ware and matt-painted ware belongs to the LBA, but there are also types that find parallels in Troy III-V. The matt-painted (most often in bi- chrome red and black) pottery, though apparently of local production, looks ultimately to Crete for inspi- ration, and the limited range of motifs represented (e.g., spirals, foliate bands, wavy bands) is similar to the local Minoanizing pottery of the Dodecanese. The absence of light-on-dark imitations distinguishes it from the local Minoanizing wares of Rhodes and Kos. There is also no evidence that a full range of Minoan specialty implements (e.g., fireboxes) or tools (e.g., discoid loomweights) was introduced at Emborio; the lack of obvious Cretan imports also appears to distin- guish Chios from its neighbors to the south."' The most substantial Mycenaean remains come from the north edge of the acropolis in area F. Build- ing levels of the LBA for the most part were dated to LH IIIC, although two floors in area F contained non- Mycenaean style pottery that may belong to earlier phases of the LBA.l"2 The pottery in LH IIIC levels has its closest stylistic ties to Attica and Euboia; and the bulk of it appears to be Mycenaean rather than 108 In addition to the British investigations, rescue exca- vations in the Baha plot (on the south shore of the harbor at Emborio) have explored what appears to be an undis- turbed Neolithic stratum: see L. Ahilara, "AQXaLOkoyLXtd XQovLXtd trg Xov," Hiaka Hronika 17 (1985) 77-80. The relative chronology of Emborio has recently been reeval- uated in Kastro Tigani 72-83. See also the analysis of a copper ingot from Emborio, in Stos-Gale and Gale (supra n. 39) 81, fig. 10, and 82. 109 Hood's view that period X of Emborio was contempo- rary with the beginning of EN on the Greek mainland has not been widely accepted; it is unfortunate that only a single '4C date (from period IV) is available for the site as a whole. 110 See S. Hood, "Mycenaeans in Chios," in J. Boardman and C.E. Vaphopoulou-Richardson eds., Chios: A Conference at the Homereion in Chios (Oxford 1986) 169, for discussion of the use of cists for Mycenaean burials and a comparison between graves on Chios and those in the cemetery at Ar- hontiki on Psara. Similar cist graves may have been used on Skyros (supra n. 92). I'l Note, however, the presence of a strainer-vase (Emporio 575), fig. 256.2675), and a single discoid loomweight of Minoan type (Emporio 633). 112 Several sherds may date stylistically to LH IIIB, as do the four vases found in a cist grave (Emporio 582-83).</page><page sequence="28">726 JACK L. DAVIS [AJA 96 Anatolian in character, although several local shapes of Anatolian derivation are represented."3 The LH IIIC town on the acropolis was destroyed by burning; on the west slope, a contemporary destruction level was recognized, with a later poorly preserved phase of LH IIIC stratified above it. A variety of small finds from Emborio has been published: most belong to the Neolithic and EBA. They include terracotta spoons, one (and possibly two) terracotta stamp seal(s), a lump of clay used for sealing, possible crucibles, stone molds (one, of LBA date, for a butterfly pendant), loomweights, spindle whorls, terracotta figurines (mostly of Mycenaean types), an ox protome with incised decoration of EBA date, fragments of several stone vases, including a lamp of a type characteristic of the Cretan New Palace period, and an assortment of ground stone tools, chipped stone, and bone tools."114 Among the most distinctive of the various copper or bronze finds are pins of familiar Aegean EBA varieties, a flat axe, a complete Mycenaean knife, and a fragment of a cop- per ingot of LBA type. Metal finds that are clearly Neolithic in date are few; they include the tip of a knife or dagger blade and a ring pendant with an attached suspension loop. A phallic pendant of spon- dylus shell has close parallels in the Cyclades. One faience bead comes from an EBA context, another, cylindrical in shape, from a Mycenaean level. Three fragments of amber, also of Mycenaean date, are Baltic in origin.115 The animal bones from both Neo- lithic and Bronze Age levels included characteristic Neolithic domesticates."6 The dating of finds from the two caves excavated at Ayio Gala before World War II has been contro- versial. No stratification was recognized in the lower cave; excavated material appears to have washed into it through a hole in its roof. In the nearby upper cave, two distinct strata were recorded, the lower of which contained ceramics of a character similar to the bulk of the finds from the lower cave. The character of the finds from the lower cave is not closely paralleled either at Emborio or at Tigani on Samos. Most schol- ars view the finds from Ayio Gala as largely earlier than those of Emborio period X and partly contem- porary with the Middle Neolithic of the Greek main- land."7 Small finds from Ayio Gala include terracotta human heads from figurines or attachments to vessels, bowls of steatite, part of a stone schematic figurine, bone tools, stone and shell pendants, celts, and stone bracelets. Finds from elsewhere on the island echo the se- quence of Emborio. At least 14 sites with traces of definite or possible prehistoric activity can be added to those listed in the Gazetteer. 118 They are dominantly of EBA and LH III date.19 113 For a fuller discussion of the Mycenaean finds from Emborio and elsewhere in Chios, see Hood (supra n. 110) 169-80. 114 For the chipped stone, see S. Hood and P.G. Bialor, "The Chipped Stone and Obsidian Industries of Emporio and Ayio Gala," in Emporio 699-713. Obsidian is notably scarce in all levels at Emborio and in both caves at Ayio Gala; local flint and even limestone was used in its place. Certain other features of the assemblage (e.g., the small and totally expended cores) suggested to Bialor that obsidian was in short supply. Somewhat counterintuitively, a higher per- centage of obsidian was found in earlier levels than in the later levels at Emborio; there are only two tanged arrow- heads, both from post-Neolithic strata. 115 For the analysis of the amber, see C.W. Beck and C.A. Shustak, "Amber from Emborio," in Emporio 727-30. 116 J. Clutton-Brock, "The Animal Bones," in Emporio 678-97. "I Felsch, Kastro Tigani 96-98, argues that the stratigra- phy in the upper cave was inverted, with characteristic forms of the EBA in the lower deposits and Neolithic types in the upper. Parallels with ceramics characteristic of the Larisa, Arapi, and Otzaki A phases of the Greek mainland suggested to him that the upper cave was already occupied at an early phase of the mainland Greek Late Neolithic. Complete vases from the lower cave are compared to types of Hacilar VI and are dated still earlier. Since the earliest types found in the upper cave are not represented either in the sequence of Emborio or Tigani, Felsch suggests that both the Emborio and Tigani sequences began later than the Arapi phase of the Greek mainland Late Neolithic. See also J.B. Rutter, who, in a review of the Emborio publication (AJA 88 [1984] 410-11), dated the earliest levels at Emborio to the Final Neolithic of the western Aegean, considerably later than material from the Ayio Gala caves. Hood preferred to view the material from both caves as representing cultural tradi- tions contemporary with, but different from, those of Em- borio. In his reconstruction, habitation at Ayio Gala began later than Emborio period X and overlapped in date with periods VIII/IX-VI/V; the earliest phases of occupation at both sites were viewed as contemporary with the later stages of the mainland Greek Early Neolithic. 118 See Emporio 2-9; also, E. Yalouris, "Notes on the To- pography of Chios," in Boardman and Vaphopoulou-Rich- ardson (supra n. 110) 141-68, where detail is added to the discussion of some sites-particularly, a map of the (proba- bly) fortified EBA site of Petranos in the southwest part of the island (147, 148, fig. 2). 119 Among finds from them, a marble dagger pommel comes from Kato Fana (Gazetteer 370), two marble handles from Dotia, and a stone axe from the town of Chios (Emporio 6, fig. 3).</page><page sequence="29">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 727 Psara. Excavations in the LH III cemetery at Ar- hontiki were resumed in 1983 after a hiatus of more than 20 years.120 In addition, the northwest and south- west coasts of the island have been systematically ex- plored. The cemetery is located on the west coast of the island within the bay of Ayios Nikolaos, 3 km north of the modern town of Psara. Most of the graves, cists with built entrances, appear to have been used for multiple burials or as ossuaries; in one large grave excavated in 1984, the first articulated inhu- mation was discovered amid the remains of earlier interments. Among the grave goods were beads of clay, glass paste, faience, gold, and semiprecious stones such as carnelian, a cylinder seal, pins, bronze tools and weapons, and spindle whorls of both clay and stone. West of the cemetery are remains of walls that belong to a settlement. Excavation in upper levels produced ceramics of Mycenaean date, contemporary with those from the cemetery; surface finds, however, suggest also Neolithic and EBA occupation. On the tiny island of Daskaleio, just off the coast of Arhontiki in the bay of Ayios Nikolaos and perhaps once joined to the adjacent mainland, are remains of similar character and date; 300 m east of Arhontiki, EBA occupation levels have been found buried be- neath 5 m of alluvium. The Northern Cyclades Little new information has become available in re- cent years from the northern islands of the Cyc- lades.121 Syros. Of particular importance is an ongoing proj- ect that seeks to prepare a complete final publication for the results of 19th-century excavations on Syros, at the site of Halandriani; the vast majority of graves and grave goods from investigations in 1861, in the 1870s, and in 1898 remain unpublished. One prelim- inary report has appeared thus far in which a score of ceramic and marble vessels are described and illus- trated, most for the first time.'22 Other recent re- search has focused on the analysis of metal artifacts from the nearby site of Kastri; much of the copper appears to have come from outside the Aegean and is similar in composition to that in use at Troy.123 Delos. Recent excavations in the sanctuary of Apollo on Delos have explored Mycenaean strata just outside the fifth-century B.C. prytaneion and beneath the prodomos of the prytaneion. Mycenaean material had been employed to fill cavities in the bedrock, a leveling operation apparently conducted in conjunction with the establishment, beneath the prytaneion itself, of a round cutting in the bedrock (arguably a fountain), 5 m in diameter.124 These remains are in a sector of the sanctuary where Mycenaean activities had not previously been recorded. Investigations in 1990 launched a systematic attempt to document more thoroughly all pre-Archaic architecture. 120 Full reports have thus far appeared only in the local journal of the island: A.

Archaeological investigations of Bronze Age Kythnos in 1984-1985 included surface survey and the excavation of a previously unknown site at Skouries, east of the modern Chora in the northeast part of the island.126 Amid fragments of baked clay from furnaces, pottery of the EC II period was found with obsidian tools and slag. Some 20 round buildings of schist slabs had apparently been erected to shelter smaller furnaces built inside them. Two have been excavated. Just to the southeast of Skouries at Yeron- imos possible LBA pottery was excavated in associa- tion with a rectangular structure on a hilltop; there was reason to suspect that an EBA settlement associ- ated with the mining operation at Skouries would have been located on the nearby bay of Ayios loannis. At Tsoulis, 2 km to the south, traces of an ancient surface mine suggest prehistoric copper mining; a fragment of an EC II jar came from surface deposits as did stone and obsidian tools. Isotopic compositions of copper samples from the mines, furnaces, and various copper deposits on the island match those previously determined for the so- called "Kythnos Hoard," which is typologically of EC II date. The chemical composition of copper from slags and ores suggests that arsenical copper of the sort from which objects in the "Kythnos Hoard" were manufactured was being produced on Kythnos. All but two objects in this hoard now appear, however, to have been found on Naxos, perhaps in the Cave of Zas, along with several similar tools now in Copen- hagen.'27 Kythnos, nonetheless, appears to have been a major source for the copper used to manufacture copper-based artifacts in the southern Aegean in the EBA.128 Siphnos. Full publication of the results of interdis- ciplinary research on Siphnos has greatly transformed our impression of the importance of this island as a supplier of metals in prehistoric times.129 Wide-rang- ing investigations of traces of ancient mining on the island have demonstrated that already in the earlier third millennium Siphnos served as a significant source of silver and lead in the Aegean.'30 A consid- erable amount of EBA pottery, and at least a small amount of FN, has been found on the surface in the vicinity of the mines at Ayios Sostis, in the northeast part of the island; most of the ceramics were mixed with debris from the mining, but a number of datable pieces come from within a deposit of mining debris (Versatz) inside one mine (no. 2) itself. Artifacts from Ayios Sostis have now been published in detail; they include objects directly connected with metallurgy, such as crucibles and tuyeres, as well as domestic vessels.'31 Several other lead and silver mines in other 125 Of all the islands of the western Cyclades, the archae- ological resources of Seriphos remain the most poorly known.

Also of interest is the recent reconsideration (and rejec- tion) of claims of pre-Neolithic occupation at Maroula on Kythnos: see Perkls 1990 (supra n. 7) 125-26; finds may point instead to Neolithic or EBA activity. Earlier analysis by J.F. Cherry, "Four Problems in Cycladic Prehistory," in Davis and Cherry (supra n. 26) 25-32 reached the same conclu- sion. 127 On the "Kythnos Hoard," see J.L. Fitton, "Esse Quam Videri: A Reconsideration of the Kythnos Hoard of Early Cycladic Tools," AJA 93 (1989) 31-39. The discovery of a significant number of metal tools in recent excavations at the Cave of Zas would tend to support Fitton's and Renfrew's suggestion that the Cave of Zas was the original findspot of this hoard (but also see infra n. 177 for bronzes from the Koronas Cave on Naxos). 128 "Sources of Metals" 266-67. Present evidence suggests that Kythnos was a principal source not only for the Cyclades but also for Crete in the EBA, although data for Crete is still exiguous. 129 H. Matthius, "Sifnos im Altertum," in Silber, Blei und Gold 17-58, has summarized comprehensively the evidence for prehistoric archaeological discoveries on the island be- fore the mid-1980s. Various finds from older excavations are reillustrated; a selection of obsidian tools and debitage recovered at the sites of Vorini and Platy Yialos in the course of the recent investigations by the Max Planck Institute is illustrated in fig. 9, p. 29. On artifacts from Platy Yialo, see also E. Pernicka et al., "Alte Blei-Silber-Verhiittung auf Sif- nos," in Silber, Blei und Gold 197; for Vorini, see also G.A. Wagner and G.

Matthaus reports finds that are possibly of FN date at several sites, including Ayios Sostis (p. 30); Gropengiesser 1987 (infra n. 131) 13, 35, n. 291, also mentions material that may be typologically of the later Neolithic from the site of Ak- rotiraki (Gazetteer 312) in the southeast part of the island. With it were terracotta implements probably associated with metallurgy. 130 The extent to which its gold deposits were exploited, if at all, in prehistoric times remains unclear. 131 H.

Whatever the case, lead-isotope analyses of lead and silver finds from the Cyclades suggest that a substan- tial amount of the Siphnian metals was being used in the EBA, even at Ayia Irini, which was located near a competing source at Laurion.'33 Continued use of the mines of Siphnos in the LBA has been postulated on the basis of thermoluminescence dates of slag samples at Ayios Sostis, but no lead-isotope analyses of LBA artifacts have yet indicated a Siphnian provenance. Melos. The new British School excavations at Phy- lakopi and an intensive survey of parts of the island (1974-1977) resulted in a burst of publication in the early and mid-1980s.'34 A report on the results of excavations in the My- cenaean sanctuary at Phylakopi represents the most recent contribution to the final publication of that campaign. The sanctuary consists of two parts, an east and a west shrine: the latter constructed first, during a time contemporary with LH IIIA on the Greek mainland; the former added in LH IIIB just inside an extension to the main fortification wall of the settlement. The entire complex was severely damaged at a time when LH IIIC styles were current (in phase 2b), approximately contemporary with the destruc- tion of the citadel at Koukounaries on Paros; parts of the complex were reused, only to be abandoned finally in a later stage of LH IIIC. A street and a courtyard (the latter with a possible sacred stone or baetyl in its corner) offered access to both shrines.'35 Within the sanctuary, benches and platforms served for the display of objects. A number of drain-tile fragments may derive from terracotta channels that were used to conduct water from the roof of the east shrine; interior walls of the sanctuary were extensively coated with white plaster, perhaps in part painted red; and coarser plain plaster is likely to have been employed to seal its roof. A few fragments of plaster with painted designs almost certainly derive ultimately from levels earlier in date than the building of the sanctuary. The buildings as a whole were well constructed, but there is no good reason to believe that the cult center was directly controlled by those who resided in the contemporary Mycenaean mega- ron at Phylakopi. Pottery ranged in date from LH I/LM I to LH IIIC, although pre-LH III material is present only in small quantities as stray finds in later contexts.'36 The as- sortment of terracotta figures and figurines from the sanctuary, probably both votives and cult images, is unparalleled elsewhere in prehistoric Greece: not only female, animal, and chariot-group figurines of well- known Mycenaean varieties were recovered, but also female figures with bell-skirts of Cretan types, wheel- made bovine figurines, a possible fish rhyton, bird- askoi, a crudely fashioned large female figure with explicitly represented genitalia, and a large (45 cm), exquisitely modeled and decorated figure, the so- called "Lady of Phylakopi." Most unusual are several capped male figures with elongated bodies and ex- und Gold, see Gropengiesser 1987, 53-54. Among the pot- tery are numerous examples of bases with matt, or leaf, impressions and a possible fragment of a Cycladic frying pan. A pattern-burnished sherd and a fragment of a "cheese- pot" are the clearest examples of FN. For an obsidian "Sali- agos point" from Ayios Sostis, see G.A.

Impressed wares from Ayios loannis, also in the southeast, are compared to Thessalian EN types, and it is claimed that they represent the earliest Neolithic ceramics yet recognized in the Cyclades, a claim that remains to be substantiated. 132 Near a mining shaft at Ayios loannis, the outline of a ship pecked on the bedrock finds a parallel on Naxos among the probable EC rock-carvings from Korphi t'Aroniou; see Weisgerber (supra n. 125) 107, 109, fig. 102. 133 See E.

There is some parallelism between types found in the two shrines. Nearly iden- tical pairs are represented in several instances, and within the west shrine, the distribution of figures and figurines on platforms in its corners may indicate a male-female dichotomy in cult practices. Probable votive gifts comprise sealstones, a scarab of a Syro-Palestinian type, a small human head worked in sheet gold by repousse, two bronze figu- rines of a "smiting god" or "Reshef," their best par- allels in Syria and Palestine, and a terracotta mold for the manufacture of flat chisels. Other metal objects included projectile points, knives, an attachment in the form of a small bird, rings, awls, pins, and lead clamps. Beads, mostly of glass paste, were common in the sanctuary but rare elsewhere; two were of faience. One fragment of ivory probably belonged to a handle, another to a sword or dagger pommel. Numerous fragments of ostrich shell may all derive from a rhy- ton, fabricated from a single egg. Pieces of tortoise shells preserve drill holes and served as sound-boxes for a lyre. Two triton shells may have provided mu- sical accompaniment for ritual activities. Various spin- ning and weaving equipment was probably not associated with worship. Among stone finds are fragments of vessels of Cre- tan New Palatial types, pedestaled lamps or censers in local tuff with chevron decoration, and a pendant in semiprecious stone of a reclining lion or dog, pos- sibly of Egyptian manufacture. Ground stone tools were manufactured primarily from local volcanics; marble slabs were imported. A comparison of chipped stone assemblages from inside and outside the sanc- tuary delineated certain patterns: in the course of LB III, as the frequency of domestic use and discard of obsidian declined within the settlement as a whole, more obsidian was brought to the shrines and its use was increasingly incorporated into ritual activities. Analysis of faunal remains, however, did not detect patterns in consumption that would point to special sacrificial practices. Additional fieldwork sponsored by the British School in 1989 intensively surveyed a number of sites (most of them already known from earlier survey), including several of the Early Cycladic period.'37 New fragments of frescoes retrieved in the recent excava- tions have been described, and new reconstructions have been proposed for wall paintings previously dis- covered at Phylakopi (fig. 13). Finally, a considerable quantity of unpublished pottery of Cycladic and Mi- noan MBA types from older excavations on Melos has also been catalogued and illustrated.'38 The Southern Cyclades'39 los.

Another member of this team has recently described the distribution of Keros-Syros sites on the island and the characteristics of lithics from various Melian sites, within the context of a reconsideration of the causes that lay behind the emergence of a prismatic obsidian blade technology in the Aegean EBA.

Morgan suggests that a fresco composition involving presentation of cloth to a goddess with associated monkeys, thematically related to the frescoes of Xesti 3 at Akrotiri, may have adorned the walls of the Pillar Crypt at Phylakopi and nearby rooms. 139 Elsewhere in the southern Cyclades, the publication of an EBA bracelet from Folegandros is of interest; the ar- chaeological resources of the island itself remain largely unexplored.

In recent years much progress has been made toward setting the site of Akrotiri within the context of the overall settlement history of the island of Thera.142 Additional prehistoric settle- ments have been located both on Thera and Thera- sia.'43 It is now clear that these islands were densely settled in the centuries before the final eruption of the Santorini volcano and that their settlement pat- terns at the time of the eruption were more similar to those of Crete in the New Palace period than to those of other Cycladic islands, such as Melos and Keos.144 Limited excavation has continued at Akrotiri. Room 7 of the West House has been investigated and there have been stratigraphical tests north, south, and east of the West House. The western facade of Xesti (Ash- lar) 5 has been cleared as has a terraced platform to its west. Excavation has also progressed in Xesti 3 (fig. 142 Results of the first 20 years of work at Akrotiri will be summarized in C. Doumas ed., Axpwnrlpt &amp;O ag: Eixoat XOvtEa Cpevvag.

Many con- structional details of the building are now clarified; the original interpretation of room 9 as a lightwell (a unique architectural feature at Akrotiri) is supported. Of special interest among recent finds is part of a horns of consecration, cut from volcanic stone.'47 Re- Preliminary Statement," in TAW 111.2, 348-60. Places in which the pre-eruption surface of the island is visible have begun to be mapped and the morphology of the pre-erup- tion island reconstructed; in several places, pre-eruption artifacts have been reported for the first time on the surface of the pre-eruption soils, notably in a quarry at Megalohori and on the caldera slopes at Megalo Vouno, but the material has not yet been adequately examined or closely dated. Finds of later MC and LC date from the Mavromatis quarry near Akrotiri have now been described in more detail and appear to extend over an area of at least 5 ha. On Mavromatis, see C. Televantou, "OguvXicE McvaQopttrTl," ArchDelt 37 B' (1982) 358-59; and Minoan Influence 358. 145 For tests outside the West House, see C.

Beneath the plateia west of Xesti 5, several bedrock-hewn chambers, perhaps originally chamber tombs, appear to have been reused by Middle Cycladic potters for cleaning and storing clay. Stone vases and other EC artifacts were recovered in the course of their excavation, some of them perhaps intentionally removed from the chambers by the potters: see Prakt 1985, 171-75.

Evi- dence for Neolithic occupation remains slim; 16 sherds have shapes and decoration paralleled in finds from Saliagos. Sherds of the EBA are plentiful. Al- most all of the material is highly fragmentary and its dating, for the most part, depends on stylistic criteria. More than 75% of the total EBA pottery comes, in fact, from the final destruction levels of the settle- ment, presumably the result of recycling of various kinds (e.g., through incorporation in mudbricks or roofing). All major phases of the EC period appear to be present, and there are types characteristic of the Kampos and Kastri assemblages. The overall distri- bution pattern of the Neolithic and EC sherds sug- gests that the focus of the earliest occupation at Akrotiri was in the southwestern part of the excavated area, in the vicinity of Xesti 3. 148 For illustrations, see C.

These deposits appear to derive from debris accu- mulated in a destruction that wracked the site at a very early stage of the LBA. The fact that so many buildings were damaged and subsequently required extensive reconstruction suggests that the destruction was caused by an earthquake. The deposits from the West House and others of similar character elsewhere are commonly said to belong to the Seismic Destruc- tion Level (SDL) of Akrotiri.'52 Still further below the rooms of the West House intact vases and sherds of late MC types have been found in pits of uncertain function that were cut into the bedrock.'53 Earlier stages of the MC period, in- cluding types characteristic of Phylakopi I, are rep- resented, but not in well-stratified deposits.'54 This phase in the island's history has, however, been more systematically explored in excavations in two other locations, Ftellos and the Karayeoryis quarries.'55 Both sites were discovered (and badly disturbed) dur- ing modern quarrying. There should no longer be any debate over the dating of the final destruction of Akrotiri or concern- ing its relative position in the Minoan chronological sequence.'56 Akrotiri was abandoned in LM IA at a time before the LM IB style on Crete had developed. The explosion of the Santorini volcano appears to have occurred as a single event; there was no appre- ciable delay between the depositions of the various strata of volcanic ejaculates from its eruption. It is highly unlikely that the LM IB style developed in the interval between the abandonment of the settlement and the final eruption of the volcano. Evidence from elsewhere in the Aegean leads to these same conclusions. It has been established for some years that the eruption of the Theran volcano, as represented by volcanic ash deposited in soil at Phylakopi on Melos, occurred at a time when LM IA and LC I styles were current, and not even at the very end of the LC I period.'57 Recent excavations both in East Crete and in the Dodecanese have revealed layers of Theran ash stratified over deposits of LM IA and beneath LM IB floors, with pieces of pumice from the eruption in LM IA contexts. The cumulative evidence in all cases suggests that the fall of ash occurred before 150 M.

Marthari, "The Chronology of the Last Phases of Occupation at Akrotiri in the Light of the Evidence from the West House Pottery Groups," in TAW 111.3, 57-70. 152 It was only in the course of the rebuilding of the settle- ment in the wake of this SDL that the walls of the houses were decorated with pictorial frescoes. The SDL and the general rebuilding of the town that followed it must not be confused with the earthquake damage and more ad hoc reconstruction that occurred soon before the final volcanic destruction of the settlement. On this point, see E.N. Davis (supra n. 39) 226, and comments by C. Renfrew, in TAW III.1, 70. Most recently, P.M. Warren, "A New Minoan De- posit from Knossos, c. 1600 B.C., and Its Wider Relations," BSA 86 (1991) 339, has drawn attention to stylistic similari- ties between material from the SDL and pottery in a deposit from Knossos that he dates to a newly defined transitional MM III/LM IA phase. His suggestion that the same earth- quake was responsible for the destruction of Knossos, Ak- rotiri, and other southern Aegean sites, such as Ayia Irini on Keos, cannot be entirely correct (supra n. 41). 153 Some pottery of MC character from Akrotiri is analyzed by A.G. Papagiannopoulou, in Minoan Influence 26-69; for additional observations on the technology of production, see also A. Papagiannopoulou, "Some Changes in the BA Pot- tery Production at Akrotiri," in TAW III.1, 57-66. Most of the material comes from deposits of the SDL in trench A between Xesti 2 and room Delta 20, as described by Marthari (supra n. 150), but included are finds of Phylakopi I style from the so-called Sacrificial Fire Deposit (S. Marinatos, Thera III, 19-24) and from soundings beneath the West House. Papagiannopoulou also catalogues the small amount of mainland Gray Minyan pottery that has thus far been recognized in pre-VDL deposits at Akrotiri, describes a se- lection of Minoan imports of MM II and later date, and discusses in some detail the process of Minoanization of the local ceramic industry. 154 A selection of material has been recently discussed by Sotirakopoulou (supra n. 149). 155 For a preliminary presentation of finds from the Ka- rayeoryis quarry, see Minoan Influence 321-23; a full pub- lication of this material by M. Marthari will appear in BSA. A report on the 1981 season of excavation at Ftellos has now appeared: M. Marthari, "Oil)a: rXIkkog," ArchDelt 36 B' (1981) 373. 156 See C.

DAVIS [AJA 96 the introduction of the LM IB style. Mainland Greek imports to Thera support this chronology. The stylis- tic character of the LH I pottery from Akrotiri places the abandonment of the settlement some time before the beginning of LH II, which in turn appears to have begun earlier than LM IB.1'58 The eruption of the Theran volcano can consequently not be held directly responsible for the well-known and widespread ho- rizon of LM IB destructions on Crete.159 The absolute date of the Theran eruption continues to be far more controversial, and is bound up with arguments over the acceptability of a proposed "high" chronology for the Aegean as a whole. For a number of years it has been obvious that many '4C dates from Akrotiri were too early to fit traditional chronologies that placed the volcanic destruction of the site ca. 1500 B.C. Recently arguments have been proffered for moving its destruction into the later 17th century B.C. Supporting data can be divided into three cate- gories: ice cores, tree-rings, and '4C dates. Fluctua- tions in acidity levels within ice cores from Greenland in many cases are demonstrably correlated with major volcanic events. Volcanic fallout may also affect the growth rings of trees. The study of cores and of tree- rings (both in the United States and Ireland) suggests that a major volcanic event occurred in the later 17th century, and neither the ice cores nor tree-rings in- dicate a major eruption ca. 1500. Recently reported '4C dates of samples from short-lived plant matter retrieved from the VDL at Akrotiri in the main seem to support a date in the 17th century for the eruption. There are very few artifactual synchronisms between Greece and Egypt during the early LBA. The dates and contexts of relevant imports and exports are in almost all cases disputable, and the evidence on which the traditional Aegean chronology has been based seems capable of accommodating a higher chronol- ogy.160 Many specialized studies of artifacts from Akrotiri have recently appeared. Metallurgical analyses have shed light on the nature of local industries and their sources for raw material.161 Chipped stone tools were manufactured almost totally of imported Melian ob- sidian. Yiali sources are hardly represented, but char- 158 See Y.G. Lolos, "On the Late Helladic I of Akrotiri, Thera," in TAW 111.3, 51-56. See P. Warren and V. Hankey, Aegean Bronze Age Chronology (Bristol 1989) 97-98, and esp. 214 on the date of the Theran destruction relative to LH II and the relationship of LH II to LM IB. 159 See J.S. Soles and C. Davaras, "Theran Ash in Minoan Crete: New Excavations on Mochlos," in TAW 111.3, 82-95; P.P. Betancourt et al., "Excavations at Pseira: The Evidence for the Theran Eruption," in TAW 111.3, 96-99. From a Cycladic perspective, it never did appear plausible that the final desertion of Akrotiri had actually occurred at a time contemporary with LM IB in Crete. It has been difficult to imagine that the absence of LM IB styles at Akrotiri could be explained by a stylistic time lag between the inception of LM IB on Crete and its introduction to Thera, despite the undeniably close relationship between LM IB vase painting and the Thera frescoes noted, among others, by L. Morgan, "Morphology, Syntax, and the Issue of Chronology," in Pre- historic Cyclades 165-78. The masses of LM IB pottery found both at Phylakopi on Melos and at Ayia Irini on Keos, even farther north than Thera, suggest that commerce with Crete was frequent and that certain settlements in the Cyclades were au courant with the latest Minoan fashions both before and after the Theran eruption. 160 The bibliography on this subject is far too extensive to be summarized here. For a review of the state of the contro- versy before TAW III, see S.W. Manning, "The Bronze Age Eruption of Thera: Absolute Dating, Aegean Chronology, and Mediterranean Cultural Interactions," JMA 1 (1988) 17-82. For a balanced picture of the results of TAW III as they pertain to this issue, see S.W. Manning, "The Thera Eruption: The Third Congress and the Problem of the Date," Archaeometry 32 (1990) 91-100; "The Santorini Erup- tion: An Up-date," JMA 2 (1989) 303-13; S.

All basic bibliog- raphy through 1989 can be found in the two reviews by Manning. Most recently, evidence pertaining to the date of the erup- tion of the Thera volcano has been critically examined within the context of a general overview of the evidence for the relative and absolute chronologies of the Aegean, Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt during the Bronze Age in S.W. Man- ning, The Absolute Chronology of the Aegean Early Bronze Age: Archaeology, Radiocarbon, and History (Sheffield 1992). Manning here proposes and discusses a revised absolute chronology for the entire Cretan Bronze Age and, in addi- tion to radiocarbon dates from Akrotiri, reconsiders those available for Ayia Irini on Keos. Warren and Hankey have continued to defend a lower chronology, based largely on artifactual synchronisms, and would place the eruption of the Santorini volcano in the later 16th century (supra n. 158, 215); see also P.M. Warren, "The Minoan Civilisation of Crete and the Volcano of Thera," Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum 4 (1990-1991) 29-39. Muhly has recently claimed that the artifactual synchronisms between Greece and the Near East support a low chronology; his arguments have been countered by Manning: J.D. Muhly, "Egypt, the Aegean, and the Late Bronze Age Chronology in the Eastern Mediterranean: A Review Article," JMA 4 (1991) 235-47; S.W. Manning, "Response to J.D. Muhly on Problems of Chronology in the Aegean Late Bronze Age,"JMA 4 (1991) 249-62.

It has been argued that the fractional units within the system of measure on which these weights are scaled find parallels both in Linear A and Linear B. It has also been suggested that at Akrotiri, such weights, as well as rarer weights of stone, were used for the measurement of heavy goods, wool in particular.'66 Imported ceramics attest to considerable interac- tion between Akrotiri and other areas of the Aegean. Chemical and petrological analyses have had some success in defining the local products of Akrotiri.'67 The local character of the LC I ceramic industry at Akrotiri emerges distinct from that of Crete and other islands, despite the fact that many aspects of Minoan technology were blended with earlier Cycladic pro- duction techniques.168 Even in the EBA, ceramic as- semblages at Akrotiri were complex mixtures of imports from several locations with geologically dis- tinct clays outside Thera.'69 A tentative reconstruction of some aspects of the agricultural economy of prehistoric Thera is now also possible. Pre-eruption soils in the vicinity of Akrotiri were more mature in their development than previ- ously thought.'70 Analysis of palaeobotanical remains has begun, in particular of Spanish vetchling (Lathyrus clymenum), a crop well represented in the West House. Examination of these pulses and the contaminants and weed seeds found with them suggests that the various deposits of vetchling in the West House came from different fields, probably of quite small size.

Torrence, "Other Silaceous Materials," in Davis [supra n. 38] 95-96.

DAVIS [AJA 96 organization of landholding in prehistoric Thera may be possible in the near future."'7 Only about 1 ha of the site of Akrotiri has been excavated. Local topography and test excavations sug- gest that the site originally covered some 20 ha, and that its harbor probably lay in what is now the valley of Ayios Nikolaos, some 200-300 m west of the cur- rent excavations."72 Means of access, lighting and ven- tilation, and drainage all appear to have influenced the plan of the town and the overall density of its habitations, as did a lack of open courts within the houses. One principal purpose of narrow alleys was to provision the interiors of buildings with light and ventilation. The design of individual structures can be analyzed in terms of general architectural mod- els.'73 In this way a basic architectural vocabulary for the site can be compiled, one that serves not only to permit generalization about the architectural idiom of Akrotiri but also encourages attempts to explain any variation from the expected.174 The art of Thera continues to attract considerable attention from art historians, and justifiably so. But even the recent literature is already so voluminous that only a separate review could do it justice.'75 Sev- eral papers delivered at the most recent Thera and the Aegean World Congress are of particular impor- tance.176 Paintings from the West House have been newly reconstructed in light of architectural analyses. 171 See A. Sarpaki, "'Small Fields or Big Fields?' That Is the Question," in TAW 111.2, 422-31; also A. Sarpaki and G. Jones, "Ancient and Modern Cultivation of Lathyrus Clymenum L. in the Greek Islands," BSA 85 (1990) 363-68.

Palyvou, "Notes on the Town Plan of Late Cycladic Akrotiri, Thera," BSA 81 (1986) 179-94. Palyvou is cautious in estimating the size of the town, noting only that it was large "by the standards of the time." This becomes clearer when the likely area of the site is compared with that of contemporary Aegean centers: see discussion by Wiener in TAW III.1 (supra n. 21) 129-31. 173 C.

An atlas illustrating the Theran frescoes accompanied by brief infor- mative texts by C. Doumas has been promised by the Thera Foundation. I thank D.A.

Davis (supra n. 39); R. Laf- fineur, "Composition and Perspective in Theran Wall-Paint- ings," in TAW III.1, 246-50. S.A. Immerwahr, "Swallows and Dolphins at Akrotiri: Some Thoughts on the Relation- ship of Vase-Painting to Wall-Painting," in TAW III.1, 237- 44 examines the relationship between Cycladic pottery dec- oration and fresco painting. C. Televantou, "New Light on the West House Wall-Paint- ings," in TAW III.1, 309-24, offers new reconstructions for the paintings of the West House. The interpretation of the iconography of the West House paintings remains a popular topic. See especially L. Morgan, The Miniature Wall Paint- ings of Thera: A Study in Aegean Culture and Iconography (Cambridge 1988). S. Hiller has seen the miniature West House frescoes as a reflection of a vanished Minoan epic poetry: "The Miniature Frieze in the West House-Evidence for Minoan Poetry," in TAW III.1, 229-34. The localities represented in these same frescoes was reconsidered by J.W. Shaw, "Bronze Age Harboursides," in TAW III.1, 420-36, by J.A. MacGillivray, "The Therans and Dikta," in TAW III. 1, 363-69, and by G. Heiken, F. McCoy, and M. Sheridan, "Palaeotopographic and Palaeogeologic Reconstruction of Minoan Thera," in TAW 111.2, 370-76. W.-D. Niemeier, "Mycenaean Elements in the Miniature Fresco from Thera," in TAW III.1, 267-82 argues strongly against the presence of Mycenaean iconography in the miniature frescoes of the West House, and suggests instead that they illustrate the Minoan Thalassocracy. On the interpretation of the Xesti 3 frescoes, see especially Morgan (supra n. 39), and N. Mari- natos, "Minoan-Cycladic Syncretism," in TAW III.1, 370- 76. J.

Fragments of a previously unrecognized town belong to the west wall; on the north wall the well-known fragments that de- pict a "meeting on the hill" and a "shipwreck" are associated with previously unpublished ships and a town on a hill; the "Nilotic landscape" of the east frieze appears to have provided landscape context for a third town; and the more completely preserved frieze of the south wall has been altered slightly through additions and repositionings. The Central Cyclades Naxos. Recent fieldwork on Naxos has included systematic site survey, continuing excavations at the important prehistoric center of Grotta-Palati (the Chora of the island), and concerted efforts to explore Neolithic remains.'77 Only a decade ago the very ex- istence of permanent Neolithic settlement could be doubted.'78 Today, there are well-stratified finds from two locations: the western edge of the shore at Grotta and the Cave of Zas, high on the central massif of the island. The sequence at Grotta appears to begin ear- lier than that in the Cave of Zas, and is in part con- temporary with material from Saliagos.179 Finds from Grotta come from a rescue excavation near a place where more than half a century ago "sub- Neolithic" material was reported and from a sounding at nearby Kokkinovrachos.8so These discoveries cou- pled with the presence of "sub-Neolithic" material on Palati suggest that the Neolithic site was extensive. Pottery from the lowest levels inside the main cham- ber of the Cave of Zas shares features with that from the Saliagos culture, notably white-painted patterns, but crusted and pattern-burnished wares suggest that Oeiol," ArchEph 1984, 14-54, discusses jewelry from Ak- rotiri in detail, with illustrations both of actual finds (mostly bronze and bone pins and stone beads) and of their depic- tions in the wall paintings, and, in "The Theran Wall-paint- ing: Artistic Tendencies and Painters," in Crowley and Laffineur (supra n. 19), has defined hands of individual painters. 177 For the results of general survey, see R.

A Bronze Age site has been reported at Kalamadikou, and prehistoric sites at a number of other locations have been noted; one is probably a cem- etery. A source of flint and associated debitage at Stelida to the southwest of the Chora of Naxos has been studied, but its exploitation in prehistoric times has not yet been conclu- sively demonstrated (see M. S6f6riades, "Un centre industriel pr'historique dans les Cyclades: Les ateliers de d'bitage du silex de Stelida," in Les Cyclades 67-80). The results of palynological investigations at Grotta and two other locations on the island are described in J.

Lambrinou- dakis, "Archaeological Research on the Early Cycladic Period in Naxos," in Cycladic Culture 25-26. In 1989-1990, a large EC cemetery was explored at Kato Sangri in the western part of Naxos: Lambrinoudakis in Cycladic Culture 26. The excavation of a grave at Panormos Korfari ton Amygdalion has also been described: 0. Hadjian- astasiou, "HI&amp;voQto," ArchDelt 36 B' (1981) 378. In the east of the island a new prehistoric site, fortified with rounded towers, has been reported at Zas Kastelli; see "Chronique" 1989, 818; also C. Doumas, "Cycladic Culture," in Cycladic Culture 20; "Weapons and Fortifications," in Cycladic Culture 92. Aside from systematic fieldwork a number of individual prehistoric artifacts from the island have been published for the first time. These include EC stone and terracotta objects from graves in the region of Panormos (Bossert, supra n. 121), among them a terracotta vessel of the "teddy-bear" type. Many previously unillustrated EC finds from Naxos have been illustrated in Cycladic Culture, several of which are also illustrated in F. Zafeiropoulou, Naxos: Monuments and Museum (Athens 1988). These include: marble palettes, stone vessels, querns, pestles, hammers, chipped stone, a sealstone, stone beads, figurines, sling stones, terracotta vases (including a bell-shaped cup and a spouted jar of the Kastri group), jugs and a tankard from Panormos, a bone spindle whorl, bronzes (some from the Koronas Cave in the northern part of the island), lead rivets, and a silver-plated bronze dagger. 178 See Les Cyclades 64-65. 179 The evidence from both sites has been summarized by K.

DAVIS [AJA 96 the cave was first inhabited somewhat later than the abandonment of the settlement at Saliagos itself.'81 Higher levels share features with FN Kephala on Keos. The sequence appears to continue unbroken into the EBA, providing an important bridge between the later Neolithic and transitional EBA sequences of the Greek mainland and the eastern Aegean. The later EBA stratum is characterized by Kastri Group types, and contained a substantial number of bronze tools and ornaments. Around a hearth were scattered pieces of unbaked clay with 15 seal impres- sions, made by an estimated five different seals bear- ing linear motifs. The highest levels contained finds of the historical periods mixed with Middle and Late Cycladic wares, including LH IIIC, and much Minyan and MC matt-painted. A strip of gold from a Neolithic stratum is the earliest gold object from the Cyclades; copper axes, awls, pins, and spatulas are also repre- sented in Neolithic contexts. Domesticated crops were similar to those exploited on the Greek mainland; barley played a prominent role in the diet. Two large leaf-shaped, bifacially retouched, obsidian spearheads are exceptional components in the lithic assemblage; as on the Greek mainland, there appears to have been a shift from percussion to pressure-flaking at the end of the Neolithic. Other small finds of particular inter- est include a marble bowl and two bird-heads carved from bone. Surface investigations in 1985 at the site of Mikri Vigla and the publication of Middle and early Late Cycladic finds from Grotta have shed light on the later prehistory of Naxos. Mikri Vigla is a promontory on the west coast, some 8 km south of the Chora.'82 Artifacts and traces of architecture are abundant on the surface, and have been mapped by the Greek Archaeological Service and the British School at Ath- ens. Fragments of monochrome painted wall plaster were associated with the most impressive building (structure 7): to the east of it a rescue excavation yielded fragments of an MC storage jar. Local and imported pottery from surface collections ranges in date from EC through LC III; polychrome and mono- chrome matt-painted varieties of probable Melian or- igin, Middle Minoan imports, and Gray Minyan are represented-types very scarce in Naxian contexts."83 Later pots and terracotta lamps imitate shapes of Minoan origin. Approximately 140 fragments of figurines were collected, for the most part small (some minute), standing, and anthropomorphic. They are diverse in style and as a group quite unique in the Cyclades; general parallels with Cycladic marble sculpture and Cretan coroplastic suggest that their production be- gan in the EBA. Other small finds include discoid loomweights of Minoan type, fragments of emery, and marble objects (including a bowl and probably a folded-arm figurine). Petrographical analyses and sty- listic observations indicate that substantial quantities of pottery were being imported, both from Melos and Crete.'184 Elsewhere on the island, evidence for settlement in the later Bronze Age has been recognized in the Kalandos area (in the extreme south of Naxos), at Sangri, at Rizokastellia, and at Grotta itself.'85 Rescue excavations in a building plot (the Dimitrokalli plot) at the west end of Grotta, immediately south of the causeway that leads to Palati, have produced well- stratified deposits of the early LBA, the first published from the site. Excavations included the reexamination of a 10-m stretch of paved road cleared before World War II and subsequently backfilled. On the floor of a building to the south of the road were local and imported pots of LC II and LM IB types, covered by destruction debris of rubble and mudbrick; these in- cluded a jug, probably imported from the Dode- canese, Marine Style sherds, and fragments of a vase by the so-called Reed Painter. This was a site well situated within the Minoan orbit and in close contact with centers of the southern and western Cyclades. Large-scale excavations at the Chora of Naxos were completed in 1985. Work had been resumed in 1978, the principal goal being to complete excavation of various parts of the LH IIIA to LH IIIC settlement explored in earlier campaigns (1949-1974), but not 181 In addition to Zachos (supra n. 179), finds from the Cave of Zas are discussed in Zachos, "AvcowxcaXi Yilckaov Zdg Nad6og: Kat'torejro 1987," ArchDelt 42 B' (in press), a report on excavation seasons in 1985 and 1986; and in Zachos, "Late Neolithic Origins of Cycladic Metallurgy," and A.

Early Cycladic artifacts attest to oc- cupation, but the settlement appears to have been deserted between the EBA and LH IIIC, when habi- tation was established anew.'88 In LH IIIC the site was well fortified with Cyclopean walls and the plateau on top was occupied by a "mansion"; in its ruins were large numbers of ceramic, stone, bronze, lead, and ivory artifacts. The complex was destroyed in a mas- sive conflagration, promoted, no doubt, by a hostile attack: the body of an adult, killed by a wound to the head, had been hastily buried before the wound healed; the bodies of other humans and livestock were left amid the debris. More recent investigations have defined the extent of Mycenaean settlement more accurately. Defenses on the southern approaches to the acropolis have been explored, and to the east the Mycenaean fortifications have also been located.s89 On the Lower Plateau, east of the upper acropolis, extensive and deep EBA strata (containing EC I material) have been explored be- neath the LH IIIC levels; a tanged point of Saliagos type, a marble pendant in female steatopygous form, and ceramics suggest that Koukounaries was inhab- ited already in the Neolithic period.'90 Excavations beneath the temenos of the Athena temple on the Middle Plateau have revealed, at the lowest levels, remains of building materials and arti- facts of LH IIIC (including a pierced triton shell), contemporary with destruction levels of the megaron on the Upper Plateau; on the bedrock itself are EBA layers. Ash mixed with animal bones and shell suggest that from Geometric times this area was the focus for rituals. The cemetery of the Mycenaean settlement was located in a valley northwest of Koukounaries. Three excavated tombs resemble mainland tholos tombs and have chambers (rectangular with rounded corners) with stone walls and corbeled roofs built in Cyclopean style; all were robbed.191 All finds from excavations ca. 1900 on the citadel of Paroikia (the modern Chora of the island) have been recently reexamined.'92 The principal architec- tural remains should be dated to the final phase of Phylakopi I and are contemporary with the earlier part of period IV at Ayia Irini. A small amount of pottery is both earlier and later in date than main deposits. One of the earliest finds is a large fragment from a burnished rolled-rim FN bowl. Several sherds from burnished tankards are contemporary with Ayia Irini period III; a fragment of a hat-vase belongs to 186 See Lambrinoudakis, Prakt 1985 (supra n. 177) 144- 61; Lambrinoudakis and F. Zafeiropoulou, "Avaouxaq? MlqrQoO'Xcwg; Nad'ov," Prakt 1985, 162-67, with earlier references. Subsequent to completion of the excavations in the Plateia Mitropoleos, the most significant structures were roofed in situ to form a subterranean museum. Subsidiary investigations in conjunction with the building of the roof provided additional details concerning the prehistoric settle- ment. See Ergon 1989, 122-25. The study of Mycenaean pottery from Archaeological Society excavations at Grotta is currently being undertaken by M.B. Cosmopoulos, who de- livered a paper entitled "Mycenaean Naxos: An Overview of the Evidence," at the International Congress of Mycenology in Rome-Naples, October 1991. 187 Aside from excavated finds, EBA stone (including a schematic figurine) and ceramic artifacts, perhaps from southwestern Paros, have been published; one vessel has parallels in the Kastri Group.

There is limited evidence for rehabi- tation in later LH IIIC after the destruction of the citadel; a substantial Protogeometric settlement followed. 189 D.

Later material includes familiar Melian types such as the paneled cup, a single bell-cup of LM IB date, and deep bowls of LH IIIC. In general there appears to have been less Minoan influence on the development of MBA pottery at Paroikia and less contact with the Greek mainland than at Ayia Irini or Phylakopi. The main deposits are characterized by Gray Minyan of developed mainland varieties, MC burnished wares, and matt-painted barrel-jars and jugs (figs. 19-20); duck-vases and the extensive use of potters' marks are features in common with the earlier MBA at Phylak- opi and Ayia Irini.

Some 500 objects have been attrib- uted to the so-called "Keros Hoard," which was reputedly recovered at Kavos in the southwest part of the island. The presence of so many marble objects on so small an island is astonishing, and the nature of prehistoric activity on Keros was the center of much discussion in 1983 at the British Museum conference on EC art; several participants suggested that Kavos had served as a prehistoric ritual center in the EBA Aegean.'94 Investigations at the site were resumed in 1987, and included a systematic collection of surface artifacts."95 Preliminary analysis of finds suggests that Kavos and, in the later stages of EC II, a settlement on the adjacent islet of Daskaleio were parts of a single large settlement.'96 Adjacent to this settlement was a deposit of special character in which marble artifacts and certain ceramic types were discarded in greater quantities than elsewhere on the site. The earliest pottery is of Keros-Syros EC II types, but Kastri varieties are also represented.'97 Occasional sherds reminiscent of Phylakopi I are found but are extremely rare; their date is uncertain. Visual and petrological analysis suggests that an exceptionally high percentage (50-60%) of pottery from the site was imported from elsewhere in the Cyclades. Ce- 193 0.

While a full interpretation of the site's function has not yet been offered, these observations do not ac- tively support the hypothesis that Kavos was an inter- national sanctuary.'98 Elsewhere in this group of tiny and sparsely popu- lated islets, excavations on Kato Koufonisi have ex- plored part of a settlement of LC II date.'99 Samos Neolithic finds were recovered in several stratified soundings and in various isolated pits in the bedrock that were explored in the late 1960s while examining the Hellenistic settlement at Tigani. The publication of these finds has forced a revision of the older relative chronology established for Tigani. The various pits have been assigned to four chronological phases (I- IV) based on stratification in the soundings; several phases have been subdivided on the basis of stylistic criteria. The latest deposits appear to correspond to Emborio phases VII-VI in date (i.e., they antedate the beginning of the EBA); the possibility has been raised that phase I of Tigani began prior to the be- ginning of the Late Neolithic on the Greek mainland. No indisputable stylistic similarities with Troy I or the EBA sequence from Thermi on Lesbos have been noted; it has been suggested, however, that the earliest ("black") phase of settlement at Poliochni on Lemnos may be only slightly later than Tigani period IV. Several artifacts from Tigani do, however, find par- allels in EBA levels elsewhere in the Aegean area and habitation probably continued at the site, despite the absence of an undisturbed EBA stratum. Recently published finds from the excavations in the Heraion on Samos may close the gap between its sequence of EBA settlements and the Tigani se- quence.200 There, at some remove from EBA levels previously uncovered, four stages of construction were identified within prehistoric levels more than 2 m deep. Part of a fortification wall appears to have sported a rounded tower, and was apparently a pre- decessor of a previously investigated EBA enceinte. The fortifications rest on earlier habitation levels that lay beneath the water table and could not be investi- gated. The fourth and latest phase of occupation seems to have been contemporary with the EBA set- tlement already known at the Heraion. By then the fortifications investigated in this sounding were out of use and a rectangular building, part of a larger complex, extended the area of habitation beyond that previously enclosed within the settlement. The new evidence from the Heraion also points to the existence of a substantially larger prehistoric settlement than previously suspected. At Tigani, the overall distribu- tion of finds also suggests that estimates for the size of the settlement in the later stages of the Neolithic require revision. Newly published and republished small finds from Tigani include 11 stone vases, and several figurines, both terracotta and marble.201 In the lithic industry, blades of obsidian are dominant, with a few obsidian arrowheads in Tigani III, a situation that contrasts remarkably with that at Emborio and Ayio Gala on Chios, where obsidian played a palpably subordinate role.202 Despite close stylistic relationships recogniz- able in the ceramic styles of the two islands, it is not clear that there was much direct exchange in pottery. It has, in fact, been suggested that in the Neolithic a cultural dividing line should be drawn between them, with Samos looking away from Chios toward the Cyc- lades and the southeast Aegean.203 The Dodecanese The past decade has witnessed a veritable explosion of new information relevant to the prehistory of the southeast Aegean, although as yet excavation has been limited and survey non-intensive. In the early 1980s, the absence of clear evidence for pre-LBA settlement on most of these islands was particularly odd, as was the paucity of documentation for contact between the Dodecanese and Crete, the Cyclades, or the Greek 198 Contrast the opinion expressed in Renfrew (supra n. 19) 99-100. 199 Hadjianastasiou 1989 (supra n. 185) 206, 215, n. 59. Parts of two vessels from the settlement are illustrated on pl. 40d-e. The sherd on pl. 40e may well derive from a bur- nished krater of "Aiginetan" type and, if so, would point to mainland, as well as Minoan, imports at the site. Several previously unillustrated terracotta vases from Apano Kou- fonisi have now been published in Cycladic Culture 172-73, nos. 178-80; additional EC terracotta vessels and stone fig- urines from both Apano and Kato Koufonisi are illustrated in Zafeiropoulou (supra n. 177) 30, 32-33, 37, 40. 200 See H.

The picture now emerging for later phases of the Neolithic is one of a relatively dense distribution of sites, with similarities in material cul- ture to Late Chalcolithic centers of Western Anatolia. The general characteristics of Neolithic settlement can be outlined.205 Earliest settlement is represented best by the lower phase of occupation in the Kalythies Cave on Rhodes, and is contemporary with the begin- ning of the Late Neolithic period on the Greek main- land. The Late Neolithic of the Dodecanese has been divided into four phases (Late Aegean Neolithic 1- 4), broadly contemporary with the Late Chalcolithic of Anatolia; each phase has been defined on the basis of stratified deposits from recent excavations and from extensive surface finds (fig. 21).206 All Neolithic sites thus far investigated in the Dodecanese are small in comparison to those on either the Anatolian or Greek mainlands. Caves were frequently chosen for occupation. Final reports on the results of recent excavations at five Neolithic sites in the Dodecanese have already appeared: the cave at Kalythies Ayios Yioryios on Rhodes; the cave at Arhangelos Koumelo on Rhodes; and open-air sites at Partheni on Leros and at Kastro on Alimnia.207 These and sites on Yiali (below) were 204 Evidence prior to 1982 is summarized in J.L.

The purpose of that project was to supplement and clarify earlier reports summarized in the Gazetteer: 60 new prehistoric sites were recorded, 35 of them on Rhodes. Several of these have, however, yielded only finds of chipped stone and are not conclusively of pre-Mycenaean or even prehistoric date.208 Thus far little evidence for occupation anywhere in the southeast Aegean prior to the Late Neolithic has been recognized.209 Three phases of the Late Neolithic have been rec- ognized in the Kalythies Cave excavations (fig. 22). The most recent corresponds to the second phase of occupation at Tigani on Samos. Here as elsewhere in the Neolithic Dodecanese, Melian obsidian is common (80% of the chipped stone), but obsidian from Yiali and Anatolia is also represented. Plant remains were recovered by sieving and impressions of plants were found on pottery. Plentiful human and faunal re- mains include a full range of basic Neolithic domes- ticates (cow, pig, sheep, goat, and dog), all but dog apparently raised for meat rather than for secondary products, as well as various species of birds, fish (in- cluding a tunny-sized specimen), and crustaceans. Only selected joints of deer appear to have been brought to the site. Fox, hare, and marten may have been deliberate live imports to the island, and the earliest domesticated chicken and black rat in Europe may also be attested.210 Human bones belong to at least four infants and eight older individuals; juve- niles and adults are mainly represented only by hand and foot bones and front teeth. The cave may, there- fore, have served as a site of permanent burial only for infants, while the bones of juveniles and adults were transferred to another location for secondary burial. closely determinable date at Pylonas Cave of Halil and at Arhangelos Limani Papakonstanti, both on Rhodes, see Sampson, "AQXdyyExkog" and "Aylog Fe6qylog Kak- vUO~wv," ArchDelt 34 B' (1979) 448-49; "Avaoxw?alxg eQ- yaoi eg: P6bog," ArchDelt 35 B' (1980) 558-59. 208 Neolithic Dodecanese 96-115 contains a gazetteer that includes Neolithic, EBA, and some later findspots on Rhodes, Kos, Karpathos, Symi, Alymnia, Leros, Patmos, Halki, and Tilos.

(Courtesy Adamantios Sampson) Excavations at the Koumelo Cave on Rhodes un- covered two superimposed surfaces: the lower of these was contemporary with the uppermost level of the Kalythies Cave, the top with the Final Neolithic of the Cyclades. Above Neolithic levels the cave was filled with a deep deposit of ash, apparently ejected by the Minoan eruption of the Santorini volcano.21' On the tiny currently uninhabited island of Alimnia between Rhodes and Halki, excavations also uncov- ered parts of a settlement, including walls from both apsidal and rectangular structures. Habitation was contemporary with the latest phase of occupation at the Koumelo Cave, as were badly eroded buildings at Partheni on Leros. Neolithic settlements have also been investigated on the tiny island of Yiali (fig. 23).212 Prehistoric remains are rare in the northeast where deposits of obsidian are located. On the neck that joins the northeast to the southwest part of the island, pottery and ground stone finds of FN and EBA date have been excavated (fig. 24); only here has EBA pottery been recog- nized.213 FN finds are widespread in the south, and include terrace walls and the foundations for a three- room house with curving walls (fig. 25). Many vessels were associated with its destruction deposits as were two crucibles for melting copper. Remnants of over 70 rectangular cist graves have been excavated. No bones or grave goods were found in any, despite sieving, but from the Neolithic pottery around them there can be little doubt about their date. Ground stone tools were widespread. All appear to have been manufactured from local materials, with handstones of sandstone, limestone, and andesite, and querns mostly of andesite. Axes were not common. Recent fieldwork in the Dodecanese does not sug- gest that Yiali ever served as a major supplier of obsidian to the Aegean; organized quarries have not been recognized. Although irregular flakes found both on Yiali and Alimnia were employed as tools for expedient purposes, regular types of chipped stone tools even on Yiali itself were manufactured of Melian (and perhaps Anatolian) obsidian and of flint.214 Early Bronze Age. Sites appear to have decreased in number between the Neolithic and the EBA. Contact with the adjacent Anatolian mainland seems to have been frequent. The earlier parts of the EBA are the 211 Problems in assigning volcanic ash found outside Thera to the Minoan eruption of Santorini are discussed by R.B. Galloway et al., "Radio-isotope Analyses of Aegean Tephras: Contribution to the Dating of Santorini Volcano," in TAW 111.3, 135-44. There the likelihood of a post-Neolithic erup- tion of the Yiali volcano, virtually contemporaneous with that of Santorini, is asserted-a suggestion that found little support from others in attendance at the TAW conference; see the discussion of this paper on pp. 144-45.

Davis et al., "Keos and the Eastern Aegean: The Cretan Connection," Hesperia 52 (1983) 365-66. This obsidian does not appear to have been extensively used because of its poor fracturing properties. It was thus appar- ently not the availability of obsidian that attracted early inhabitants to the island. See also H.G. Buchholz and E.

Matt-impres- sions are present on the bases of so-called "cheese-pots" (p. 101). Neolithic pottery and obsidian from both Melos and Yiali have also been found on the islet of Pergousa, just to the west of Nisyros (Neolithic Dodecanese 252). 214 Although Melian obsidian is not at all rare in the Do- decanese, the quantities in which it is found and a general scarcity of evidence for other kinds of Cycladic imports may be indicative of much more limited interaction between the Cyclades and Dodecanese than among the Cyclades them- selves, or between the Cyclades and the Greek mainland (see also Melas 1988 [infra n. 237] 290).</page><page sequence="49">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 747 Fig. 24. Yiali. Excavations in sector A.

In recent excavations material of similar character has been found at Ayios Fokas on Kos and on the island of Yiali. Finds from Askloupi and Mes- saria on Kos, from Muskebi on the Anatolian main- land, from Lindos on Rhodes, and from Nisyros have sometimes been dated to EB III, but it has most recently been argued that the material from Askloupi and Messaria is of EB II date. EB II parallels from Tsilimbiri on Kos and from new excavations of graves at Tavla near Antimaheia on Kos have been ad- duced.216 Rescue excavations at Seraglio on Kos and Asoma- tos on Rhodes should clarify the EBA sequence con- siderably.217 At Seraglio, a fortified settlement of EB III has been revealed in deep soundings beneath the later Bronze Age town; it was itself built on top of earlier levels of EB III, including the remains of a potter's kiln. Part of a single long house, possibly with one "ellipsoidal" wall, has been cleared. Ceramics Fig. 25. Yiali. Foundations of a Neolithic house.

DAVIS [AJA 96 (wheelmade red-burnished bowls, duck-vases, and tankards) find close parallels both in Anatolia and in the western Aegean. At Asomatos near Kremasti, west of Trianda on the north coast of Rhodes, two long "megaron-like" buildings have been uncovered, and were associated with similar pottery. They belong to the latest phase of the site and overlay parts of houses on a different orientation. Fortifications are surmised because of the density of architectural remains.218 Middle Bronze Age. The Middle Bronze Age in the Dodecanese remains a mystery on which recent ex- plorations have shed little light.219 The settlement at Asomatos came to an abrupt end in EB III. On the basis of finds (mainly carinated bowls220) from com- pressed levels found stratified in several soundings between EB III and LB I layers,221 it has been argued that occupation at Seraglio was continuous from the end of the EBA to the LBA, but it is far from clear that all phases of the MBA are represented. A kiln for firing the bowls has also been investigated.222 Mi- noanizing pottery with light-on-dark decoration, widespread in the Dodecanese and often assigned to the MBA, is more likely to belong to the earlier phases of the LBA, both in the southeast Aegean and in the Cyclades where it was imported.223 As yet, there is little evidence for earlier versions of this style.224 Later phases of the MBA are best represented by finds from Mt. Filerimos on Rhodes, high above the northern coastal plain, southeast of Trianda.225 At Profitis Elias on the most eastern spur of this massif, survey and excavation have yielded unstratified finds and traces of architecture. Jugs more Anatolian than Cretan in appearance were found with carinated and conical cups; some pottery belongs to LM IA. The existence of MBA material on Mt. Filerimos itself has now been clearly demonstrated. The only well-strati- fied group of finds (excavated in 1925) comes from a floor, not clearly associated with other architectural features, southwest of the later Athena temple; finds of similar character were probably excavated in a fill beneath the temple itself and in other parts of the acropolis. Only undecorated pots were found on the floor; most have their closest parallels in MBA Crete. Small finds are both of MBA and LBA varieties and include a stone lid of MM type, a spindle whorl, a terracotta scuttle, a discoid loomweight, stone vases, marble pommels, and a bronze mirror. Late Bronze I and II. LB I patterns of settlement contrast radically with their predecessors. In northern Rhodes, the focus of activity shifted from Mt. Fileri- mos to Trianda on the coastal plain below, where there is, for the first time, evidence for widespread habita- tion. Recent excavations have filled out the picture of occupation sketched by extensive Italian excavations before World War II.226 The LB I settlement at Trianda was large by island standards, and has been estimated at over 12 ha. Moreover, the thoroughly Cretan character of the settlement has been rein- forced by new discoveries. Buildings had plastered floors and walls; characteristically Minoan architec- tural features such as the polythyron and ashlar ma- sonry were employed; and new fresco fragments, including one with a painted lily and another with a double-axe and sacral knot are in the Minoan idiom. Horns of consecration in stone suggest Cretan reli- gious practices, as do new bronze figurines of Minoan types. Results from recent excavations at Trianda in the Theoharis plot have been fully published. Excavations there in 1975, 1978, and 1980 uncovered structures within an area of approximately 360 m2.227 Three main constructional phases were recognized, Trianda 218 On Asomatos, see Marketou (supra n. 215) 40-47. 219 Neolithic Dodecanese 119-20. 220 See Marketou (supra n. 215) fig. 5b. 221 Marketou (infra n. 230) 101-104.

No trace of the LM IA style was recognized in the pottery of Trianda I. It is necessary, therefore, to redate the earliest occupation at Trianda to the later MBA, ap- proximately contemporary with finds from Mt. Fil- erimos. Trianda I appears to be the earliest stratum at the site; in places, excavation reached bedrock and Trianda should still be viewed as a new foundation in the New Palace period of Crete. The character of the shapes and decoration of pot- tery in Trianda I is overwhelmingly Minoan, and Cretan features such as discoid and cylindrical loom- weights, a bull figurine, a stone vase, potters' disks, fragments of faience, and frescoes decorated with bands or curvilinear motifs are all represented.229 Other small finds include fragments of small gold bands, a bronze sickle, bronze needles, and a lead rod. The cause for the destruction of Trianda I is not readily apparent. Phase II, on the other hand, showed obvious traces of destruction by fire, perhaps precip- itated by an earthquake. The damaged remains of the settlement were soon partly covered by a layer of volcanic ash from the Santorini eruption; the latest pottery sealed beneath the ash belongs to the LM IA style. The Minoan LM IB style is only represented in strata above the ash layer. Elsewhere on Rhodes, lay- ers of ash from the Santorini eruption have been investigated: near the airport at Paradeisi and on the east coast at Kolymbia the layer exceeded a half meter in thickness.230 In Trianda IIIA, a large house with rooms around a central court was built in the Theoharis plot. Many walls are quite substantial and ashlar masonry was sparsely employed; in the western part of the house, a second story was reached by wooden stairs within stairwells. After a destruction (perhaps caused by an earthquake), lighter less consequential walls, which infringed on the area of the courtyard, were added to the complex in Trianda IIIB. Individual strati- graphical levels could not be assigned to phase IIIA; the final abandonment levels of phase IIIB are dom- inated by LM IB/LH II ceramic types.231 Other recent soundings at Trianda have provided important details concerning the extent and duration of the prehistoric settlement. Excavations since 1982 in the Markos plot (300 m west of the Theoharis plot) have exposed the most western part of the Minoan/ Mycenaean settlement, including parts of an LM IA building with a polythyron.232 In the Kattavenos plot (300 m south of the center of the Italian excavations at Trianda), LM IB remains lay above volcanic ash, with LM IA remains beneath.233 These and other recent soundings suggest that the southern part of the LM IA settlement had been abandoned after the eruption of the Thera volcano; in LM IB, new struc- tures, including a possible defensive system, were built above the ash layer in northern parts of the site, and the settlement decreased in size. Imports from Crete continued in LM IB and Cypriot wares were also present. Evidence of expansion of settlement in LB I is also evident in areas east and west of Trianda: contem- porary remains have been explored in five other lo- cations. These are spread over an area of more than 14 km along the coast, and from the village of Trianda to the foot of Mt. Filerimos. In addition, on the east coast of Rhodes LB I artifacts have been excavated in 228 Phases defined by the new excavations can be approx- imately equated with those defined by A. Furumark ("The Settlement at Ialysos and Aegean History c. 1550-1400 B.C.," OpArch 6 [1950] 150-271) as follows: Trianda II= Furumark Trianda I; Trianda IIIA and B= Trianda IIA and B, respectively. Trianda I, on the other hand, represents an initial stage in the settlement not defined by earlier in- vestigators. 229 There are several striking differences between this Mi- noanized assemblage from Trianda and contemporary de- posits in the Cyclades. Obsidian from Melos was present but scarce; mainland matt-painted and Minyan wares do not appear to be represented at all; and there is little evidence for the importation of Cycladic pottery. Not surprisingly, imports from Western Anatolia are indicative of exchange between Rhodes and the adjacent mainland; see Papazoglou- Manioudaki (supra n. 227) 171-72. 230 On Theran ash, see T. Marketou, "Santorini Tephra from Rhodes and Kos: Some Chronological Remarks Based on the Stratigraphy," in TAW 111.3, 100-12; C. Doumas, "The Prehistoric Eruption of Thera and Its Effects," in Dodecanese 34-38. 231 Later Mycenaean finds include a bronze arrowhead, and a phi-figurine was recovered nearby at the so-called Pyrgos of Paraskevas; see Papazoglou-Manioudaki (supra n. 227) 181. 232 See S.

DAVIS [AJA 96 the cave of Koumelo234 and are represented among surface finds from Kolimbia-Theotokos.235 Results from recent excavations at Seraglio on Kos echo those from Trianda.236 The LM IA town at Seraglio also increased markedly in size, and two ar- chitectural phases have been recognized. After the first was destroyed by earthquake, there was a major reorganization of the town and a main street was established that led from the harbor up the hill to the main focus of the settlement. The second phase of the settlement was destroyed before the end of LM IA (probably also by earthquake); remains of human victims were found in its rubble. As at Trianda, a layer of volcanic ash covered this debris in part, but the ash appears to have fallen measurably later than the earthquake destruction. Recent research on Karpathos, Kasos, and Saria paints a picture similar to that being established for Rhodes and Kos.237 Here too there is considerable question about the date and extent of earlier (i.e., pre- Mycenaean) settlement. Surface investigations have documented considerable activity in the later Neo- lithic period and during transitional Neolithic/EBA phases, but finds are extremely worn and difficult to parallel either in the Cyclades or on Crete. EBA and earlier MBA assemblages have not yet been well de- fined. By the later MBA, it seems clear that Karpathos, Kasos, and Saria had been drawn into the Minoan orbit. The finest Minoan Kamares types characteristi- cally found at Phylakopi or Ayia Irini already in the earlier MBA, however, have not yet been reported and there is only slight evidence for the importation of Cycladic wares.238 Definite or possible finds have been published from more than 40 separate locations. Accumulating data suggest the existence of an exten- sive Minoanized center at Pigadia, capital of modern Karpathos. This settlement lay in the southeast part of the island on the south side of a large bay that faced the southern tip of Rhodes.239 The focus of prehistoric occupation appears to have been the coastal plain, bordered on the west by the hill of Skopi and on the east by the acropolis of Sissimos; chamber tombs, some as early as MM III/LM IA, were dug into the slopes of both. The existence of prehistoric settlement at the Xe- nona site has long been recognized, but it is now obvious that occupation in the Pigadia area was much 234 See Sampson, in Dodecanese (supra n. 205) 13-14; in the Koumelo Cave, early LBA pottery (said to be of LM/LC and Cypriot types, including a base-ring jug) was found to be stratified both above and below the ash layer (Neolithic Dodecanese 214). See also Neolithic Dodecanese 74. Layers of ash associated with archaeological finds have also been rec- ognized on Tilos, Karpathos, and Halki.

Here recent construction work afforded opportunities to examine stratigraphy. Finds are of types characteristically found at Minoan and Minoan- izing centers elsewhere in the southern Aegean and include plentiful conical cups, red wall-plaster, pottery of MM III/LM I varieties, and extensive deposits of murex shells. Elsewhere on Karpathos, on Saros, and on Kasos, similar ceramics are widespread, if not so closely dat- able. Sites are generally small with undistinguished finds (occasional loomweights of Minoan type are not- able); most are located on, or near, coasts. Pottery actually imported from Crete appears to be excep- tional outside Pigadia. Trapeza (L60) on Kasos is an exception; Minoan finds were plentiful there and ash- lar masonry was possibly employed. On Kasos the primary focus of occupation seems to have shifted from the southwest area, that part of the island closest to Crete, to the north coast at some time between LB I and LB III. Minoan finds have also been recognized on many of the smaller islands of the southeast Aegean, e.g., at Garipa on Telos,240 and at Pontamos Ayioi Anargyroi on Halki.241 Late Bronze III. Study of the Mycenaean period in the southeast Aegean continues to be hampered by a lack of properly excavated and completely published settlement sites; fullest information comes from ex- cavations conducted in the 1920s and '30s when these islands were under Italian occupation.242 Recent syntheses of previous archaeological investigations on Rhodes provide convenient points of departure for any discussion of the complex history of settlement in the Dodecanese during the Mycenaean period.243 Findspots are concentrated in the more fertile areas of the north, particularly around Trianda, but cham- ber-tomb cemeteries have been recognized in most other parts of the Rhodian periphery and at several sites in the interior.244 Since thousands of tombs have been looted and their contents transferred to museum collections out- side Greece, a great many artifacts both on Rhodes and abroad have little or no context. A pleasant ex- ception are tombs in the Lindos area excavated in 1925 in a salvage operation designed partly to com- pensate for damage done by tomb-robbers. The re- sults of these excavations have recently been published, and many tomb-groups now divided be- tween Turkish and Danish museums have been reas- sembled on paper.245 It has also been possible, in most cases, to relocate the sites of the original excavations. The restudy of Mycenaean finds from Italian ex- cavations at Trianda (lalysos) has clarified the later history of northern Rhodes. There the identity of those who used the numerous chamber tombs (of LH IIB-IIIC date) at Makra Vounari and Moschou Vounari has long been at issue. Very little pottery later than LH IIIA: 1 was published in the report of Italian excavations at Trianda, nor have excavations on Mt. Filerimos yielded substantial numbers of LBA finds.246 Furumark, in his reanalysis of the excavations of Trianda, all but ignored the scanty Mycenaean evidence and assumed that the settlement was aban- doned in LH IIIA:1. It is now clear, however, that substantial numbers of LH IIIA:2 sherds were found in the older exca- vations; these were distributed over so large an area that it is unlikely that they were transported from elsewhere, despite a lack of associated architectural remains.247 Current excavations at Trianda may re- solve the matter soon. Thus far they have produced some evidence for occupation later than LH IIIA: 1, including a few sherds of LH IIIB; LH IIIC is possibly also represented. The first chamber tombs at Ialysos were built in LH IIB/IIIA: 1; weapons were prominent in these earliest burials.248 Minoan influence and imports had almost totally disappeared. Elsewhere on Rhodes, contem- porary finds are thinly distributed. In LH IIIA:2, however, an island-wide pattern in the geographical 240 A.

DAVIS [AJA 96 distribution of tombs was established that persisted until LH IIIC. LH IIIB finds are, however, strangely uncommon, and it has been argued that this situation reflects an actual decrease in settlement.249 In LH IIIB, there was a substantial decrease in the number of tombs built or in use at Ialysos and perhaps more generally in northwest Rhodes. In other parts of the island, the number of tombs in use also appears to have decreased substantially, except in the southeast where there are slightly more IIIB finds than in pre- vious periods. LH IIIC, on the other hand, witnessed a sudden increase in the number of burials at Ialysos; many older tombs were reused and more Mycenaean figu- rines were deposited in burials. Most interments ap- pear to date early in LH IIIC. A "continuous but thin thread" seems to have been maintained between the Argolid and Rhodes throughout the IIIC period, but at most sites there is no pottery of the later stages of LH IIIC. It has been suggested that there may have been internal migration in early IIIC from other parts of the island into the Ialysos area.250 Recent research on Kos, Karpathos, Kasos, and Saria has also clarified the pattern of Mycenaean set- tlement. In Karpathos, Kasos, and Saria there remains an unexplained gap in the local sequence of habitation during LM IB and LM II, a peculiar absence given the presence of substantial amounts of LM IB at Trianda on Rhodes. In LH III, there appear to have been far fewer sites than in MM III/LM IA and none has yet been located on Saria; most settlements and cemeteries were in naturally fortifiable locations where no evidence of earlier LB I occupation has been recognized. LM/LH IIIA and earlier LH IIIB types of ceramics are well represented; the later phases of LM/LH IIIB and IIIC are curiously absent. Imports from the mainland have been recognized but Cretan types remained dominant, in contrast to the situation on Rhodes and Kos.251 Cemeteries with chamber tombs of Mycenaean type became the rule on Kos, Kalymnos, and Astypalaia.252 Excavations at Kardamaina (ancient Halasarna) on the south coast of Kos may help sort out details of Dodecanesian relative chronology in LB III; a strati- graphical sequence of deposits is said to run unbroken from LH IIIA: 1 through Greek and Roman times.253 Mycenaean finds have now also been recognized even on smaller islands of the southeast Aegean such as Leros.254 Amorgos Many new prehistoric sites have been reported on Amorgos and the locations of older finds identified with greater certainty through recent surface explo- rations.

Elsewhere on Amorgos, excavations both on the acropolis and in the lower town of Minoa have yielded finds of the Neolithic and EBA, principally in post- Bronze Age contexts (such as the filling of a tower in the Geometric fortifications), but also unmixed in bedrock pockets.257 A fragmentary EC folded-arm figurine, found in the filling of a Roman cistern, is the first EBA marble figurine found on Amorgos in proper excavation since the 19th century.258 BEYOND PHYLAKOPI: TOWARD A PAN-AEGEAN PREHISTORY The study of the prehistory of the Aegean islands has long been hampered by the absence of a flexible relative chronology based on a series of published deposits from settlement contexts. In the absence of competition, the stratigraphy of a single well-docu- mented and long-lived site, Phylakopi on Melos, mo- nopolized center-stage for much of this century. The dominance of this type-site has often encouraged the proliferation of uniformitarian assumptions about Aegean island prehistory and it has consequently been very difficult either to define or explain variation in material culture between one part of the Aegean and another. It could still be said in 1979 that our comprehension of the cultural history of the Cycladic EBA had not improved greatly since the results of the first excava- tions of Phylakopi were published in 1904. Already then three main groups of material dating to the EBA were recognized and there was considerable consen- sus about the order in which they were to be arranged: finds from the Pelos cemetery on Melos were early, material from the fortified acropolis of Kastri on Syros fell in the middle, and the first city at Phylakopi at the end.259 No single site in the Cyclades had a strat- ified sequence that could be argued to span the totality of the EBA. At Phylakopi itself, it could be doubted that the site had been occupied at a time contempo- rary with EH II on the Greek mainland.260 Although Phylakopi was admirably published by the standards of its day, because of the method of its publication, any reevaluation of its conclusions in light of subsequent developments in Aegean prehistory is a formidable task. The contexts of finds from the excavations were generally described only with ref- erence to successive broad phases or "cities" into which the history of the settlement was divided. Groups of finds were not published as units; in most cases, it is not possible to determine which specific finds were found associated in a single excavation level.261 Furthermore, since the publication of Phylak- opi, various additional "groups" have been defined, consisting of artifactual types that have consistently been found in association with each other in Cycladic graves. There has been considerable controversy over the relative chronology of some of these groups; it has even been suggested that the so-called Kampos group, often assigned to a stage intermediary between the Grotta-Pelos and Keros-Syros assemblages, may not represent a chronologically significant develop- ment at all but rather a series of wealthy burials for "socially conspicuous individuals."262 Many of these chronological conundrums may soon be resolved. Our understanding of the Neolithic in the islands is improving at a rapid pace. In another decade deposits of the Cycladic EBA will have been published from Ayia Irini on Keos (periods II and III), from the equally important site of Skarkos on los, and from Markiani on Amorgos. The stratigra- phy of these three sites will provide a broad geograph- other architectural features, and EBA pottery are reported to have been found at Mandres tou Nikita Roussou and are to be associated with tombs excavated nearby by Tsountas at Kat' Akrotiri (Gazetteer 340). 256 See Annual Report of the Managing Committee, the Brit- ish School at Athens (1986-1987) 32; (1987-1988) 28; (1988- 1989) 23; and (1989-1990) 19; AR 36 (1989-1990) 69; and Renfrew (supra n. 19) 44, 45, 96. 257 See Marangou 1985 (supra n. 255) 184-86, 191, 196- 98.

DAVIS [AJA 96 ical scope and should allow, for the first time, the construction of a relative chronology for the EBA Cyclades that is based almost entirely on settlement stratigraphy. Of special importance will be the publi- cation of material of the initial phases of the EBA at Markiani: these finds in tandem with recently exca- vated "pre-city" deposits at Phylakopi and transitional Neolithic-EBA strata from the Cave of Zas on Naxos should permit firm definition of the beginning of the Cycladic EBA. The position of the Keros-Syros phase of the Cy- cladic EBA is solidly established as contemporary with EH II on the Greek mainland. Ayia Irini period II, the principal deposits at Skarkos, and pre-city phase A2 from Phylakopi will allow this stage to be more tightly defined both in the western and southern Cyc- lades. The final stages of the EBA present greater problems. The Kastri Group and its Euboian equiva- lent, Lefkandi phase I, remain poorly understood. Although its type features have been recognized at many sites in both the northern and southern Cyc- lades, only at Ayia Irini is there abundant contextual information from an excavated settlement. There it is clear that the Anatolian features in the ceramics are displayed in only a small minority (about 10%) of the pottery in use. There is an obvious continuity in ma- terial culture from the preceding Keros-Syros phase. The hypothesis that the Cyclades were invaded and settled by new immigrants at the time of the Kastri Group is weak. It has often been argued that the sites of Kastri on Syros and Panormos on Naxos were settled by Anatolian newcomers, but neither has been fully published and it is not possible, as at Ayia Irini, to assess the extent of Anatolian influence on their ceramics. Kastri types from Mt. Kynthos on Delos are totally devoid of stratigraphical context. Ceramic characterization studies of Kastri Group ceramics are badly needed. The possibility that Ana- tolian types were brought to some Cycladic islands through exchange with the eastern Aegean cannot be excluded. The suggestion that sites such as Kastri were established as forts by Anatolian invaders is even less convincing now that the site of Markiani on Amor- gos appears to have been fortified already at the very beginning of the EBA. It seems less likely that the Kastri phase was the only, or even a special, time of troubles in the EBA Cyclades. The existence of weap- ons manufactured from bronze of a composition sim- ilar to that employed for bronzes in use at Troy also need not point to invaders from that part of the Aegean. More recent analyses of metal artifacts from Troy and the islands of the northeast Aegean suggest that a northwest Anatolian provenance for the Trojan bronzes themselves is in doubt, and it now is generally agreed that the Anatolian ceramic types that charac- terize the Kastri Group are of southwestern Anato- lian, rather than Troadic, derivation.263 The Kastri phase may be more plausibly seen as a phase of in- creased interaction between the Cyclades and the southeast Aegean. After Ayia Irini period III and the abandonment of Kastri, the ground is very shaky until the inception of Ayia Irini period IV. There is certainly a gap in the stratigraphy of Ayia Irini between periods III and IV. Period III must be more or less contemporary with the later stages of EH II on the mainland, while period IV does not begin until the earliest phases of the mainland and Cretan MBA have passed. Periods equivalent to mainland EH III and earlier MH are completely unrepresented. More serious is the fact that almost no evidence has yet been recognized any- where in the Cyclades for occupation contemporary with EH III on the Greek mainland, nor is there a stratigraphical sequence in the Cyclades that bridges fully the centuries of transition between the Cycladic EBA and MBA. This fact has led to the provocative suggestion that there is a general "gap" in the Cycladic sequence: whether this is an accident of excavation or reflects a time of generally thin settlement remains to be determined.264 With the start of period IV at Ayia Irini, we again have a firm footing. Indeed, periods IV and V at Ayia Irini appear to cover most of the later MBA.265 Details of chronology become controversial again at the very end of the MBA. In Cretan terms, the latest imports in period V at Ayia Irini appear to date to the begin- 263 On the relevant analyses from Kastri, see Z.A. Stos- Gale, N.H. Gale, and G.R. Gilmore, "Early Bronze Age Trojan Metal Sources and Anatolians in the Cyclades," OJA 3 (1984) 23-43. On the southwestern Anatolian origin of Kastri Group types, see M.J. Mellink, "The Early Bronze Age in West Anatolia: Aegean and Asiatic Correlations," in G. Cadogan ed., The End of the Early Bronze Age in the Aegean (Leiden 1986) 139-52, and Wilson and Eliot (supra n. 35). 264 For arguments pro and con, see "Perspectives"; refer- ences in n. 123 (supra); Warren and Hankey (supra n. 158) 25-29; and J.B.

Arguments are sum- marized and discussed at length in Manning 1992 (supra n. 160). 265 Recent excavations at Phylakopi have not produced detailed stratigraphy for the MBA. For this and other infor- mation concerning the second city of Phylakopi, I am grate- ful to Robin Barber, who has allowed me to study his unpublished report on newly excavated Middle Cycladic pottery.</page><page sequence="57">1992] THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN 755 ning of MM III. The earlier stage of period VI has been considered more or less contemporary with the Seismic Destruction Level at Akrotiri on Thera, and both have been dated in Cretan terms to the very beginning of LM IA. This is also the time when the Second City of Phylakopi was destroyed. There would, therefore, appear to be a gap in the Ayia Irini sequence. On Crete, the transitional MM/LM phases have never been closely defined; refinements there should allow the nature and duration of this gap to be described in greater detail. The beginning of the LBA in the Cyclades is clearly represented by deposits of early period VI at Ayia Irini and from the Seismic Destruction Level at Ak- rotiri. The publication of these deposits will provide definitions for early LC I that are practicable within the Cyclades. It would be unwise to redefine the be- ginning of LC I in reaction to revisions in Cretan terminology. Subtle definitions of MM III and LM I, of the sort currently being proposed by Minoan spe- cialists, could only be distinguished in the islands of the Aegean were substantial quantities of Cretan im- ports present. This is rarely the case, even in the Cyclades, where Minoan pottery never amounts to more than a fraction of the total in an assemblage. For the remainder of the LBA, recent publications have clarified many details of relative chronology. The eruption of the Santorini volcano represents a pivotal stage and it is now obvious that the material in the Volcanic Destruction Deposits at Akrotiri is contem- porary with a later, but not the latest, stage of LM IA on Crete. Stratigraphy at Phylakopi on Melos suggests that only some time after the eruption of the Santorini volcano did the first LM IB imports reach that site.266 Times contemporary with LM IB on Crete and LH II on the Greek mainland are well represented by Ayia Irini period VII, which can itself now be subdi- vided. Plentiful finds of the LB III period have been illustrated, including destruction deposits at Kou- kounaries on Paros (dated to an early stage of LH IIIC), a long sequence of ceramic assemblages in the sanctuary at Phylakopi (LH IIIA-C), and groups in the temple at Ayia Irini (LH IIIC). Publication of LH IIIA-B deposits from Ayia Irini will also be invalu- able. We thus seem well on our way to establishing a relative chronology for the Cyclades that reflects the full range of variation within these islands as a whole. If this goal is to be accomplished we must resist the temptation to impose rigid chronological frameworks on a pan-Cycladic or pan-Aegean scale. Rather the stratigraphical sequences of each and every site and island need first to be considered individually and only then related to those of other islands: it is partic- ularly important that stratified groups of material from Cycladic settlements continue to be published, rather than selections of finds arranged by phases established at some other site such as Phylakopi or Ayia Irini. Such a procedure is complicated, but the complexity is only reflective of the truly intricate na- ture of the archaeological record itself. Our purpose after all is not to establish a chronological system of mnemonic simplicity for students. Enormous progress is also being made in sorting out the relative chronology of other islands and island groups of the Aegean. More detailed publication of finds from excavations in the prehistoric settlements at Manika should clarify the material cultural se- quence of Euboia for Bronze Age periods earlier than the first phase of Lefkandi. Our understanding of later EBA and MH phases will profit from the com- plete publication of the results of excavations in the Vouratsas plot at Eretria, and from Palamari on Sky- ros. In the northern Aegean, stratigraphy from Skala Sotiros and Kastri on Thasos will be of great impor- tance in linking the cultural sequences of the northern Aegean to those of the south, both in the EBA and LBA. Emborio on Chios and Tigani and the Heraion on Samos also emerge as pivotal sites that tie the later Neolithic and EBA Cyclades to the eastern Aegean and Anatolia. Recent developments in the Dodecanese have al- ready made important contributions to our under- standing of the cultural history of the latest MBA and earlier LBA. The systematic inventory of archaeolog- ical remains and the identification of new sites have radically changed our picture of the density and dis- tribution of settlements, particularly in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. The earlier MBA is, however, still poorly understood, as is the EBA. The investiga- tion of EB III levels at Asomatos on Kos is thus of great importance. We are still a long way from un- derstanding the significance of substantial gaps in habitation sequences present on many of the islands of the Dodecanese. It should also be evident from this review that relative chronology has not been the only, or perhaps even the principal, emphasis of recent fieldwork in the Aegean islands. Excavations such as those of house A on Keos or the sanctuary on Melos have been published with an opulence of detail that makes it now possible to begin to reconstruct the social and 266 See Davis and Cherry (supra n. 41).</page><page sequence="58">756 JACK L. DAVIS economic organization of prehistoric island centers for the first time. The full documentation of se- quences at Akrotiri, Melos, and Keos permits us to hypothesize about the processes responsible for changes in material culture there. Intensive surveys on Keos and Melos, and systematic efforts also to inventory prehistoric resources in parts of Naxos, los, Siphnos, Keros, Amorgos, Euboia, Skyros, Chios, in the Sporades, and in the Dodecanese are giving us the first reliable pictures of patterns in settlement within entire prehistoric island landscapes. It seems fair to say that the Aegean islands should no longer be viewed as a backwater but as one of the best-documented areas of prehistoric Greece, or even of prehistoric southern Europe.267 Great progress has been made. The relative chronology of settlement is much better known than it was only a decade ago, and, perhaps of greater importance, excavations of settlement sites have established local stratigraphical sequences in all major parts of the Aegean. The pub- lication of current excavations and advances in the study of absolute chronology promise to resolve long- standing problems in relative chronology and should make it possible for archaeologists to shift at last the focus of their efforts from matters of chronology to the reconstruction of the societies and economies of the islands of the prehistoric Aegean.268 Indeed, the next decade promises to be exciting.
