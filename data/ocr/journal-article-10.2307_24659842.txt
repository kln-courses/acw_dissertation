Bannon Wesleyan University Abstract In this paper I attempt to develop several ways Merleau-Pontys ontology might contribute to an environmental ethic through a redefinition of his concept of flesh in terms of a general theory of affectivity. Currently accepted interpretations of the concept such as those in Abram, Toadvine, Barbaras, and Dastur rely upon conceiving flesh as a perceptual experience. I contest this inter pretation and argue that a more productive conception of flesh emerges when understood in terms of Heidegger's philosophy. The paper concludes with a consideration of the normative significance of flesh by examining the role of "wildness" within a place-based ethic. Keywords Maurice Merleau-Ponty, nature, environmental ethics, flesh, ontology, time In recent years Merleau-Ponty's philosophy has taken on a newfound impor tance within the field of environmental philosophy. Particularly since the pub lication of his lectures on nature at the College de France, there have been myriad investigations of the implications of Merleau-Ponty's ontology for philosophical thinking concerning the human relationship to nature.1 While " For examples of Merleau-Ponty's influence in environmental ethics, in addition to works cited in this text, see the following: Merleau-Ponty and Environmental Philosophy: Dwelling on the Landscapes of Thought, ed.

Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327—357 these inquiries deal with a multitude of subjects and philosophical issues, there is a general consensus that Merleau-Ponty's notion of "flesh" is his central contribution to environmental philosophy and ethics. Thus, Isis Brook speaks for most when she maintains that the importance of flesh lies in how it pro vides a distinct account of the human relation to nature, while she herself finds that Merleau-Ponty's ontology "legitimizes wonder as a virtue."2 Discussing nature in terms of flesh is intended to provide our idea of nature with a depth and richness, an activity of its own, that the traditional conception of it is thought to lack, and to do so without appealing to any reality beyond the sensual one in which we live.3 The idea of flesh accomplishes this reconceptu alization by revealing the mutual imbrication of the subject and object within perception.4 Simon James situates the appeal of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy in its de-centering of humanity, since "to conceive perception as a self-reflexive relation of a single 'element' is to picture it, not as a human act, but as some thing like an event, and one, moreover, that has a transpersonal and indeed trans-human dimension."5 These sorts of claims make Merleau-Ponty's phi losophy especially attractive in light of recent analyses such as Jane Bennett's concerning the need to rediscover sites of enchantment within the world, that is, to experience a combination of excitement and apprehension that accom panies a disruption of the everyday order of things.6 Difficulty arises, however, because despite the claims of environmentally oriented philosophers that Mer leau-Ponty's philosophy offers a non-anthropomorphic account of sensory experience, the prevailing scholarship on Merleau-Ponty takes the opposite view, arguing that nature and things receive their dynamism from the human perceptual field. If the ontology of flesh is to be productively used within an environmental ethic, we must embark upon an elucidation of that notion in Feminism," (PhD diss., Vanderbilt University, 2002); Don Marietta, Jr., People and the Planet: Holism and Humanism in Environmental Ethics (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1994); John Russon "Embodiment and Responsibility: Merleau-Ponty and the Ontology of Nature," Man and World 27 (1994): 291-308; and David Wood "What is Ecophenomenology?"

The purpose of this essay is to propose such an understanding of flesh and thereby eliminate some of the confusion that has surrounded the notion, while also providing suggestions as to how this ontological concept might be of use in axiological inquiry. The essay will be divided into four sections. The first of these analyzes Ted Toadvine s and David Abram s attempts to deploy Merleau Ponty's ontology within the context of an environmental philosophy. What we shall find is that beyond the general consensus that Merleau-Ponty's ontology offers a way to reconceive the human relationship to nature, there is little agreement as to what the form of this relationship might be or how the ontol ogy can be extended to deal with ethical issues arising from humanity's imma nence to nature. I conclude that this indeterminacy is a consequence of a reliance upon established interpretations of the notion of flesh in which it is taken to be primarily a perceptual phenomenon. Accordingly, the second sec tion critically examines a number of these interpretations in order to suss out how understanding flesh as originating within human perceptual experience, even reconceived in the manner Merleau-Ponty prescribes, creates problems for the ontology. From this point, the third section develops an alternative understanding of flesh that no longer takes it to originate in and belong to human perception. Rather, I intend to shift our framework for understanding flesh from lived experience to Heideggerian fundamental ontology. In other words, I will argue that Merleau-Ponty's ontology is best understood in terms of Heidegger's attempt to think ontological difference, that is, the divergence between being as such and the being of beings.7 Concretely, I will argue that if flesh refers to the being of beings rather than to an aspect of lived experience, 71 Merleau-Ponty recommends this shift in perspective throughout the working notes but most directly in the one entitled "Science and Philosophy," from February 1959, wherein he claims, "Philosophy has nothing to do with the privilege of the Erlebnisse [lived experience], with the psychology of lived experience," recommending instead, albeit in a qualified manner, a Heideg gerian Besinnung (mindfulness, reflective thinking) upon the intersubjectively common institu tions that shape our relation to the surrounding world (Le visible et l'invisible, 233; translated by Alphonso Lingis as The Visible and the Invisible, 182; hereafter cited as VI, followed by French then English pagination). Renaud Barbaras resists the idea that Merieau-Ponty's later thought is productively interpreted as being in dialogue with Heidegger's philosophy (The Being of the Phenomenon, esp. 316-20), but, in Desire and Distance, esp. 141—42, he ultimately finds that the Heideggerian and Merleau-Pontian projects are brought to a rapprochement in the thought of Jan Patocka. I would conjecture that this difference with respect to Heidegger's importance to Merleau-Ponty himself would account for the divergence between our two understandings of flesh in what follows.</page><page sequence="4">330 Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 then it can be grounded no longer in human personal engagement with the world (i.e., lived, perceptual experience) but in a body's relational engagement with its milieu (i.e., a system of affects). The intention is that in looking at flesh in this manner, we can return to the questions and problems that arose in the first two sections and find a response to them. The fourth concluding section elaborates these possible responses. I. The Potential and Pitfalls of Flesh Strikingly, the two proponents of Merleau-Ponty's ontology who have given us the most detailed accounts of its applicability to environmental thought, David Abram and Ted Toadvine, strongly disagree concerning the nature of said contribution. This paper will not delve into the specific nature of their dispute, since my concern with their interpretations lies in how each indenti fies and falls prey to specific problems that are then addressed in section three.8 In order to see the specific issues in question, however, it is important to inquire into what each believes they have found for environmental philosophy within Merleau-Ponty's ontology. Abram, finding "the seeds of a new and radical philosophy of nature" within Merleau-Ponty's work, seeks to cultivate these germs into a full-fledged eco logical philosophy based primarily in our lived experience of the environ ment.9 For Abram, flesh is a means of establishing the ontological continuity between humans and other beings that has long been the holy grail of environ mental thought.10 For him, " For those interested in their exchange, it can be found in Toadvine, "Limits of the Flesh: The Role of Reflection in David Abrams Eco-Phenomenology" and Abram "Between the Body and the Breathing Earth: A Reply to Ted Toadvine." Abram, "Merleau-Ponty and the Voice of the Earth," 102. "" Especially among earlier theorists, it was thought that overcoming human alienation from the natural world was a simple matter of recognizing humanity's "belongingness to nature" and thereby initiating a new, non-dominating environmental ethic. While that project no longer seems so straightforward, human ontological continuity with nature is still something sought after for other reasons. Val Plumwood offers a compelling account of this ontological continuity in her Feminism and the Mastery of Nature in which she argues that nature possesses a form of agency due to its "mind-like properties" such as an orientation toward its own reproduction and continuation. Anthony Weston's "Multi-Centrism: a Manifesto" has noted the compatibility of her account with Abram.</page><page sequence="5">Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 331 The Flesh is the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and gives rise to both the per ceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its own spontaneous activity. It is the reciprocal presence of the sentient in the sensible and of the sensible in the sentient, a mys tery of which we have always, at least tacitly, been aware since we have never been able to affirm one of the phenomena, the perceivable world or the perceiving self, without implic itly affirming the existence of the other." By capitalizing the term and using the definite article, as well as asserting that flesh possesses "its own spontaneous activity," Abram leads us to believe that flesh is itself a being or substance of some sort, "The Flesh." At a later point, he tempers this language, calling the Flesh "an intertwined, and actively inter twining, lattice of mutually dependent phenomena, both sensorial and sen tient, of which our bodies are a part."12 Conceived as a lattice, the Flesh is a structure that supports and unifies the beings that are within it rather than being itself a being, yet it retains its sense of substrate. In either portrayal, the Flesh refers to an underlying structure or substance whose defining character istic is its reflexivity, the intertwining of sentience and the sensible such that one cannot readily distinguish subjects and objects.13 We could summarize the two senses of flesh within Abram's account by stating that it is an animate substance or materiality to which all beings belong even as they maintain their own specificity and difference. Abram's ethic grounds itself upon the notion that all material beings possess the reflexivity of the Flesh. Since all beings are "of the same stuff [i.e., flesh]," we find ourselves compelled to make an animistic inference, "I find myself forced to acknowledge that any visible, tangible form that meets my gaze may also be an experiencing subject, sensitive and responsive to the beings around it, and to me."14 If we act on the assumption that all beings are themselves alive, we are required to act such that the lives of these beings not be violated carelessly.15 Abram is careful to distinguish his ethic of reciprocity from an ethic of "do no harm," however, since in order to live one must engage in some form of killing. Rather than inspiring shame, recognizing our involve ment in the larger cycles of life and death that constitute an ecological system 111 Abram, Spell of the Sensuous, 66. 131 Ibid., 85. I3) The typical example of this reflexivity, from Husserl on, has been when one hand touches the other: neither hand is either purely active and touching or passive and touched. It is always possible to reverse the sensation such that the passive hand becomes active and vice versa, though the transference is never complete. 141 Abram, Spell of the Sensuous, 67.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327—357 should call us to act in place-specific ways that strengthen or support that system.16 We thereby develop responsibilities on the basis of both our belong ingness to the Flesh and our distinct manner of being within the Flesh. In either case, the recognition of this belongingness to the larger animate fabric of nature arises out of our lived experience of the world.17 While the ethic itself may seem appealing, its animistic foundation is ques tionable. Merleau-Ponty himself is clear in his rejection of animism, claiming that his philosophy of flesh "is not hylozoism," which is "a false thematization, in the order of the explicative-Entity, of our experience of carnal presence."18 In other words, Merleau-Ponty cautions us against precisely the sort of infer ence that Abram makes, namely, allowing the dynamism of our perceptual field to lead us into an ontological animism. However, given that Abram is attempting a "creative reading" of Merleau-Pontys philosophy, these objec tions may not trouble him. Of greater concern is Melissa Clarke's persuasive argument against our ability to make the animistic inference. She calls our attention to the fact that the reflexive relationship to which Abram appeals is not wholly reversible; there remains an intrinsic asymmetry or imminence within the reversibility Merleau-Ponty describes.191 would add that since this asymmetry is extremely important to Merleau-Pontys philosophy—without it the resistance and alterity of the world and others is in principle surmount able in a totalizing knowledge—abandoning it is not an option without fur ther consequences. Clarke then proceeds to argue that if reversibility is a sensual experience and that experience is inherently asymmetrical, there is no reason to accept that the reflexivity of the perceptual field is transferable to the inanimate world in the manner Abram describes. Therefore, "the rest of the world does not have the ability to sense apart from embodied, perceiving beings (who are admittedly still part of the world)," or in other words, any animism perceived in the world is derivative from sentient experience and can not be found outside ol that experience. To compound the problem, Toadvine has pointed out an additional obsta cle to any phenomenological attempt to formulate an ethical relationship to nature based on lived experience. He calls this difficulty the "inherent paradox of any phenomenology of nature: to the extent that phenomenology starts from experience, we seem constrained at the outset to reduce nature to the "" Abram, "Reciprocity," 81. 171 Abram, "Between the Body and the Breathing Earth," 268.

Clarke's observations concerning Abram's philosophy can serve as an example of the hazards a phenomenology of nature faces. Her analysis shows how the ontological continuity between human and other beings in the world is estab lished through the projection outward of a perceptual structure found within human (though very likely all sentient) experience. But if the reflexivity of nature is found only within perceptual experience, there is a problem for Abram's animism insofar as the dynamism of nature is really just an anthropo morphic or biomorphic projection. That being the case, it is difficult to see what motivation there might be behind Abram's ethic of reciprocity once the animism is abandoned. In order to extricate Merleau-Ponty from this anthropologizing paradox, Toadvine appeals to the reflexivity of flesh, also called the chiasm, with the intention of showing that human expression is a variety of natural meaning without being reducible to it.21 If expressions humans form concerning the natural world are inspired by nature itself, then nature itself must possess some innate sense that serves as the inspiration:22 "perceived meaning is ontologi cally basic, such that the perceived world of nature is meaningful on its own terms."23 Even humanized nature, then, expresses something about nature and puts us into contact with nature as the mute source of our expression.24 The mistake would be taking this expressed truth to be somehow exhaustive of the possible true expressions with respect to nature. Within every expression of truth, derived from our experience of nature, there remains a mute reference to those other possible expressions. Flesh, as a '"third dimension in which the distinction between subjective and objective becomes problematic,"25 remains, to use Merleau-Ponty's phrase, a "pregnancy of possibles,"26 which allows a 2111 Toadvine, Merleau-Ponty's Phibsophy of Nature, 52. 2" Ibid., 18 and 75.

While many have heard this phrase in the sense of birth, Merleau-Ponty seems to be using the word pregnance in the strict psychological sense employed by Gestalt theorists in which forms impose themselves upon perception given perceptual conditions. A perceptual field exhibits a "pregnancy," in which various forms can emerge from within a given field, depending</page><page sequence="8">334 Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 continual intercourse between mute nature and human expression.27 The ini tial paradox is overcome insofar as the anthropomorphizing tendencies of our experience can neither be absolutized into natures solitary meaning nor be viewed as a solely human fabrication and projection. Experience, then, can serve as a basis for our philosophical investigations of nature because the expressed humanizations of nature originate within nature itself. Despite the appeal of this resolution, Renaud Barbaras presents a conun drum for those who would be content with this mixture of lived experience and ontological investigation. He proposes that Merleau-Ponty's philosophy necessarily results in an anthropomorphic position as a result of an equivoca tion between a perceptual and ontological methodology. In the case of the perceptual philosophy based in lived experience, the anthropomorphizing is of a transcendental nature: the perceiving subjects capacities and constitution are the conditions of the possibility for experience. The phenomenon is there fore transformed into an object for the subject, even if that subject is embod ied.28 As we have already seen.Toadvine rejects this position in favor of locating the potential for expression within nature itself. Barbaras, however, argues that this strategy results in another form of anthropomorphism: we posit the mean ing of being, which in the present case is taken as nature, on the basis of the perceptual constitution of the human body.29 The result of this second anthro pomorphism is that "we are led to extend this mode of being [i.e., the psy chophysical unity that characterizes the human body] over any reality, which means we must give up the distinction between perception and perceived object and the phenomenology ot perception itself."30 Abram, of course, saw the animistic implications of mixing the phenomenology of perception and ontology quite clearly but failed to recognize the manner in which the animism and the anthropomorphic method through which it was derived are in tension.31 In short, while there is no ontological difference between our upon specific relationships obtaining between the perceiver and the world. To call flesh "a preg nancy of possibles," then, refers to how real relations determine the differentiation of seer and seen and, therefore, possibilities in the world. In other words, the ontological claim is that the real world is not a reification of a single one of a series of abstract possibilities but, rather, that the world itself determines what is and is not possible. -71 Toadvine, Merleau-Ponty's Philosophy of Nature, 92. Barbaras, "The Ambiguity of the Flesh," 20. Ibid.

Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 335 body and other beings, the meaning of this immanent being is given only in the human body. Barbaras believes this "positive anthropomorphism," which he defines as "a concept of the embodied subject as ontological witness"32 even as it "understands man [r/'c] as the measure of all things, more precisely, our body as the measure of reality,"33 is simply a truth with which we must reckon. The impact these arguments have upon Toadvine's proposed solution to the paradox is worth noting directly. Even if we follow Toadvines reasoning con cerning a phenomenological philosophy of nature and thereby preserve lived experience as a legitimate form of inquiry, we still seem to be stuck within a subjective position, insofar as the sense of nature is still accessible and mean ingful to human beings alone.34 Even if that position has become more open to, and is in dialogue with, the surrounding world, if the sense of nature is discovered by projecting the perceptual structure of the general perceiving body outward as the meaning of all beings, then the sense of nature that is uncovered is still only a sense in relation to the perceiving subject. Barbaras holds that the only way to avoid this difficulty, inherent in a philosophy of lived experience, is to take the organic body in general, life, as the basis for ontological inquiry rather than human experience, a fact that Toadvine acknowledges and endorses.35 As Galen Johnson points out, it would be hasty to replace "flesh" with an abstract conception such as "life" due to flesh's pre sumed anthropomorphism, because flesh, if conceived in terms of time and genesis rather than the human perceptual body, can help us to understand better phenomena like life and death as manifested within nature itself.34 Additionally, if "the very being of nature and language are inextricably inter twined," that is, "neither can be defined in positive terms and apart from the essential movement underway by which each crosses into the other,"37 then this natural sense that is to serve as the foundation for human expression is, at discovered as possessing the reflexivity of flesh is within perception, then, without the dynamism of human experience, there would be no dynamism of things. In other words, the world itself is not animate but appears to be so within living experience, which is to resort back to a subjectiv ist position. 321 Barbaras, "The Ambiguity of the Flesh," 25. 331 Ibid., 22. 341 Toadvine, Merleau-Ponty's Philosophy of Nature, 92-96. 3" Ibid., 94. Barbaras vacillates on whether Merleau-Ponty's ontology is a philosophy of life. In "The Ambiguity of the Flesh" and Desire and Distance, he is critical of Merleau-Ponty for not engaging in a general ontology of life, while he is much more conciliatory toward Merleau Ponty's later thought in this regard in "A Phenomenology of Life," 206-30.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 least partially, dependent upon human perception and language. Thus, a posi tive anthropomorphism or a biomorphism fails to extricate the theory from the inherent paradox of phenomenology. They merely circumscribe the para dox within a different realm: rather than focusing on the generativity of nature itself qua nature, sense remains relative to vital perception and movement. In other words, regardless of the origins of the sense immanent to nature, this sense is relative to an embodied subject. Even if one is willing to accept that the theoretical situation of any philoso phy of nature is inevitably anthropomorphic (which is not to say anthropo centric), we are then faced with another more serious problem in using Merleau-Ponty's ontology in order to formulate an environmental ethic: To say that phenomenology can serve as a basis for a philosophical investigation of nature does not clarify what kind of environmental ethic might follow from it. Toadvine puts forward a persuasive case to this effect, arguing that no ethi cal principles or responsibilities are immediately derivable from Merleau Ponty's ontology. Beginning with Mauro Carbone's point that if everything belongs to the flesh, then flesh remains the condition of possibility for every possible action, behavior, and attitude, Toadvine proceeds to point out that if an ethic is to be possible on the basis of Merleau-Ponty's ontology, it will have to be placed on a radically different foundation from traditional moral theo ries. After all, those theories are formulated in terms of conceptions of the subject, subject-object/agent-patient dualisms, and a substance-property ontology that Merleau-Ponty contests.38 The promise of Merleau-Ponty's phi losophy does not, properly speaking, lie in the prospect of formulating a new system of duties and obligations toward nature. Rather, the hope is that "an ontological shift' in our perception of the world can alter our ethos by shifting our sense of what is and how we experience and interpret our relations with things."39 Such a shift in perception, of course, is the foundation of Abram's entire project, but Toadvine is correct to assert that our belongingness to one same world or animate continuum does little to clarify how we ought to behave within it. For example, even if we begin with Abram's animistic stand point, why ought we be more mindful of and respectful to our surrounding fellow beings? Can we not imagine someone finding in humanity's ontological "" Contemporary feminist care ethicists have contested these notions as well, and I believe that these theories might be brought into fruitful relationship with Merleau-Ponty's philosophy for this reason, especially given the need Toadvine identifies to elaborate ethical principles bevond the ontology in order to make it normative.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 337 continuity with bovines or mountains a rationale by which they might then extend already exploitative human practices toward those beings to other humans as well? It is just as plausible, once human specialness has been ques tioned, to treat other humans in the instrumental manner in which natural beings are treated as it is to be more respectful toward a wider range of beings. In other words, even with the perceptual shift, there is still a need for some further ethical analysis in order to determine how to live a good human life within the natural world so conceived. We are not yet in a position, however, to deal with these issues and so will only rejoin these questions in the fourth section of this paper, wherein I will argue that while Toadvine is correct to say that no specific ethic is demanded by the ontology, it is still capable of provid ing a foundation from which a different kind of ecological ethical community is possible. It seems, then, that there are many obstacles standing in the way of advo cates of a Merleau-Pontian environmental ethic. To recap, we might summa rize them under two more general headings: the danger of anthropomorphism arising from basing the ontology in perceptual experience and the inability to draw normative conclusions from the ontological arguments. These theoreti cal hurdles, however, are far from insurmountable. In order to leap over them, so to speak, we must develop Merleau-Ponty s philosophy in a somewhat dif ferent direction, as a general theory of affects rather than in terms of sentient experience. Merleau-Ponty s goal in starting from a description of the body is not to understand the world in terms of the body but to resist anthropologism and discover structures of being itself.40 If this switch is possible, we will be able to establish the ontological continuity between humanity and other beings without resorting to an animism that projects subjective properties upon the natural world. The key to this understanding of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is challenging the traditional understanding of flesh, an under standing that articulates the meaning of flesh primarily in terms of the human sensing body. We will, as Carbone suggests, pursue a line of interpretation in which "our body turns out to be fleshly akin to the sensible world" rather than the world being akin to our bodies as discovered in experience.41 In other words, instead of discovering an animism in nature as a result of an affiliation with some sort with sentient life, human continuity with the rest of nature will be established through shared relational structures. This point will be explained in detail in the third section of this paper. The intuition behind these arguments w VI 312/164. 4" Carbone, "Flesh: Toward the History of a Misunderstanding," 49.</page><page sequence="12">338 Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 is that when we limit our understanding of flesh to what is discovered in human perception and experience (even when we then generalize these struc tures), we are limiting the potential of the flesh idea. So, in order to under stand better the resources Merleau-Pontys philosophy offers to the philosophy of nature, we must first attempt a richer understanding of Merleau-Ponty's later ontology. II. Re-envisioning Flesh Before embarking upon the reformulation of Merleau-Pontys ontology, it is important to understand the motivations behind the shift in emphasis from the lived body to a general theory of affect and to do so by exploring the limi tations of the traditional interpretations of flesh.42 There exists a wide array of views concerning how exactly we are to understand flesh, due to the cryptic descriptions found in both the manuscript and working notes to The Visible and the Invisible and the unfinished nature of the text. Lawrence Hass offers a typology of the term wherein he categorizes Merleau-Pontys usage into three broad categories: flesh as carnality, as reversibility, and as an element of being.43 In the first case, flesh is taken as "an intentional, strategic alternative to the age-old notion of matter."44 This sense of flesh is the one to which Abram appeals when he says that all beings are of the same stuff; as carnal, fleshy beings, we are all bound together in an ecological whole. Reversibility refers to the aforementioned reflexivity of sensible experience wherein the sensing body itself is always within a sensible field. Hass explains the last sense of flesh, that of an element of being, in terms of its role as the medium of our experience.45 Hass holds that these senses of the flesh are not unified but, rather, are "expres sive gestures" best understood as composing a Deleuzian conceptual multi plicity, meaning that since there is no being or thing that is flesh, the properties of flesh can be neither exhaustively enumerated nor reducible to one another. As a multiplicity, flesh is, rather, "a complex concept that will honor rather than deform the proliferate, over-spilling life ofwhat he now calls wild being";46 421 Since there have been myriad interpretations of flesh advanced over the years, we will not be able to explore them all. Rather, we shall examine those that best embody the trends under discussion. 431 Hass, Mcrleau-Ponty's Philosophy, 201-2. 441 Ibid., 138. 431 Ibid., 139-40. 461 Ibid., 141.</page><page sequence="13">Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327—357 339 the plasticity of flesh resides in how its various characterizations can always be multiplied or enter into novel conceptual relations. If, however, flesh is not properly a kind of thing or being, we need to inquire into what, exactly, is the meaning of the multiplicity, how it is formed, and what function it performs in Merleau-Ponty's ontology. Along these lines, Fran9oise Dastur has argued that flesh is "a new name for the being of every being, a new determination of the common essence of things."47 Although her account concurs with Hass' that there can be no unitary concept of flesh and that the term does not, properly speaking, have any referent, she states that it is nevertheless a new "name for being as a whole."48 Flesh is both the being of beings and the name for being as a whole because flesh is predominately a human perceptual phenomenon. Dastur attributes this conflation to Merleau Ponty's perception-based phenomenology in general and proceeds to use it to differentiate his philosophy from Heidegger's "more radical thought of Weltof fenheit [openness to world]." The radicality of Heidegger's view derives from showing a way out of a philosophy based in consciousness whereas the phi losophy of flesh remains covertly dependent upon it.49 The thought to which she refers is found in section 29 of Being and Time, wherein Heidegger describes Daseins openness to world in terms of an "attunement." For Heidegger, Dasein always only has beings disclosed to it through how it is attuned to its surroundings through a mood, such that other beings appear to them in a particular way. In other words, beings appear to Dasein as Xonly because Dasein finds itself in a particular mood. For example, if Dasein were to be experiencing paranoia, actions that might otherwise be perceived as innocuous are now taken as hostile or conspiratorial. The connection between attunement and disclosure leads Heidegger to assert that certain moods (e.g., angst, boredom, or love) disclose beings in such a way that Daseins relation ship to being as such become manifest. Affects are possible only on the basis of such moodedness, since Dasein feels the way it does depending on how a situation appears to it. But because mood arises from neither "without" (i.e., it is not objectively caused) nor "within" (i.e., a projection of Dasein), Heide gger can claim that moods arise out of a relationship between Daseins world— meaning the horizon of significance in which Dasein finds itself—the thing encountered, and Dasein itself.50 So we can understand Dastur's claim to be 471 Dastur, "World, Flesh, Vision," 33.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 that while Merleau-Ponty begins his philosophy with experience and the affects within it, Heidegger uncovers the structure that makes said affects pos sible within experience. Heidegger thereby eliminates the need to posit a sub ject that experiences affects because an affect is really a particular form of relationship to ones environs. The superiority of Heidegger's philosophy, then, lies in conceiving of affects in terms of relations rather than as experiences of a subject. While this point will become more important in the next section, for now we must note that Dastur conceives of flesh as an experience, the expe rience of perceptual reflexivity. In fact, because flesh is a human, perceptual experience, that is, "the experience of flesh is able to take place only on the terrain of perceptual faith," and yet flesh makes a being what it is, she is led to claim, "things are experienced as annexes or extensions of ourselves."51 Thus, in elaborating the perceptual nature of flesh, we arrive at the conclusion that beings are what they are as a result of the human experience of those beings, albeit things are given a constituting power over the individual perceiver. Therefore, if flesh as experience is the name for being as a whole, then it would seem to be the case that being itself is determined by and through human experience. In his exhaustive and thought-provoking commentary on Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, The Being of the Phenomenon, Barbaras concurs with Dastur's identification of flesh with the being of beings when he defines flesh as being "truly synonymous with visibility, which is the being of every being."52 Also like Dastur, he arrives at this conclusion by means of an analysis of the inad equacies of Husserl's model of act-intentionality, which lends credence to the interpretation that flesh remains an experience situated entirely within human perception. In fact, Barbaras explicitly defines flesh in terms of a perceptual horizon. He claims that "to speak of flesh is to conceive presence as a horizon rather than the horizon as the horizon of a presence,"53 meaning that the tra ditional views, in which perception is thought to occur within a fixed field upon which we have transparent access to the beings within it, are mistaken. In reality, beings themselves are present to us as a horizon, that is, there is only so much of a being that is present to us at any given time, and there will always be aspects of the being that are just beyond the horizon of its presence. Barba ras finds that this horizonal character defines being as a whole, saying: "the notion of flesh thus corresponds to the decision to conceive visibility as being 3" Dastur, "World, Flesh, Vision," 35. Barbaras, The Being of the Phenomenon, 169. 531 Ibid., 173.</page><page sequence="15">Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 341 or Being as visibility."54 So Barbaras too finds an equivalence between being as such and the being of beings through the medium of visibility. On his under standing, the carnality of flesh, its visibility, is what makes it the element of being; because sentient beings are always already within a sensible field, this sensible field simply is the only being to which we have access. These accounts share the idea that flesh is primarily a perceptual structure: the encroachment and overlapping of phenomena within perception lead us to the assertion that flesh is a new word for being. As a product of perceptual experience, the origin of flesh is within the perceiving body: sentient bodies become flesh through autoaffection, and nonsentient bodies become flesh through their being per ceived. This idea leads Barbaras to make a claim reminiscent of Abram: "The world is just as much a self that is inchoative, sense in the state of being born."55 The difference between them is that while Barbaras finds that the world and nature are animated within human perception, Abram situates this animism within nature in general. While bodies ought always to be the starting point for any analysis of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, I would like to call into question the basic asser tion that flesh is fundamentally a perceptual structure originating from a sen tient body's lived-perception. This point more than any other is what I believe lies at the heart of criticisms of the notion of flesh such as the one Luce Iriga ray offers. Indeed, if flesh originates in an individual's perception and others receive their autonomy and dynamism in virtue of a seer having "given birth" to it, are we not trapped within a kind of "incestuous prenatal situation with the whole?"56 As we have shown, the belief that leads Irigaray to this conclu sion, namely, that flesh is primarily a perceptual phenomenon originating within a human perceiver, is widespread. John Sallis gives the thought its most succinct expression when he says, "I make things flesh—I let them be revealed as flesh—by incorporating them to my own flesh."57 If this is the case, it is easy to see why Irigaray would be concerned that Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is, at its heart, another attempt to deny differences. On this interpretation, others and the world are made flesh in virtue of their being present for the perceiver. In this light, claims like Sallis' that our bodily relationship to the world is "essentially erotic" and that, in interacting with others in the world, we attempt 541 Ibid., 169. 451 Ibid., 159.

Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 "to overcome the one-sidedness of my bodily being by union with the body of the other"58 seem to encourage the appropriative attitudes toward otherness Irigaray fears. The birth ol the other is a result of asexual reproduction, a scis sion without an encounter with alterity. Even Barbaras seems to succumb to this conception of flesh when he says that "[the body] unfolds the dimensions in which things can constitute themselves" and that "the world is made of flesh, of these dimensions, of these axes of which my body is the pivot."59 If the body is the "pivot" of the world s dimensions, the central point through which the world and the beings within it constitute themselves as things, then regard less of the capacity of things within our perceptual field to constitute them selves, they are still dependent upon the perceiving body for their agency.60 Though Merleau-Ponty himself reinforces this interpretation in the line cited by all the aforementioned authors, "I cannot posit one sole sensible without positing it as torn from my flesh, lifted off my flesh,"6' there are good reasons to question the received understanding that the flesh of the body is prior to, and indeed the origin of, the flesh of the world and the flesh of things. It is at this point, then, that an intervention is necessary in order to begin reworking the notion of flesh so as to be more helpful to environmen tal philosophy. In the same note from which the above quotation is taken, "Flesh—Mind," from June 1960, Merleau-Ponty also describes the human body as "one of the sensibles in which an inscription of all the others are made," "a sensible-key," and "the dimensional sensible."62 In the initial part of the quotation, our flesh is active, and the dynamism of things is derived from that activity. In the second part, however, we see the passive side of our body, the manner in which our flesh is just "one of the sensibles," even though it is one with perceptual powers that allow the others to inscribe themselves in it. The other two characterizations, however, call for further development. A musical key is, very generally, a tonality established through specific chord progressions within a certain scale. We might speculate, then, that the body, as a sensible key, provides a specific means of organizing the various sensible Wl Ibid., 96. 5'" Barbaras, The Being of the Phenomenon, 202-3. f'"&gt; For the cited authors, the sensing body considered is primarily a human one, though other Merleau-Ponty scholars have shown how animals may possess alternative forms of bodily inten tionality and therefore distinct modes of sense creation. David Morris, for example, has pub lished several essays on this subject generally, though the most pertinent to this particular point is his "Animals and Humans, Thinking and Nature." 6,1 VI308/259.

However, by reconsidering what the "flesh of things" or the "flesh of the world" might be with references to these notions and with out reference to human flesh, we can establish the relational autonomy of things such that we do not understand their agency as posited by the sensing human body. III. The Dimensions of Flesh If an interpretation of flesh wherein the things themselves will possess a dyna mism without resorting to an animistic hyiozoism is possible, then it must begin, as Carbone suggested above, by showing how flesh is a common denominator between the human body and other sensible beings without, as Irigaray cautions us against, situating that commonality in the perceiver itself or a monistic substance. Such an understanding of the flesh is not unprece dented. Johnson, for example, also calls our attention to Merleau-Ponty's tran sition from Husserls conception of personal experience to Heideggerian fundamental ontology. He argues that though "flesh is most originally the flesh of our bodies," once our analysis of perceptual experience brings us before the anonymous and impersonal "one" that subtends our individual experi ence, "there is a progression, a development in the meaning of 'flesh' in 'Eye and Mind' from human flesh to the more general meaning of the flesh of things."64 What Johnson recommends is that we understand this more general sense of flesh in terms of a "logic of internal relations"65 that will lead to an understanding of flesh as "event and process,"66 This brief suggestion offers important insight into how we might begin to understand flesh more gener ally through the idea of internal relations rather than through perception. As an alternative to understanding the flesh of things in relation to a human body's lived relation to its milieu, then, we might understand the flesh of things in terms of their constitutive internal relations. The promise of this John Russon explores exactly this phenomenon within human life in his Bearing Witness to Infinity. See especially chapter one for a detailed analysis of the body as a rhythmically structured unity. M) Johnson, The Retrieval of the Beautiful, 30-32. 651 Ibid., 34-35. Ibid., 33. Though we do not have time to pursue the conneaion or its implications here, it is important to note that Merleau-Ponty explicitly appropriates these terms from A. N. Whitehead.</page><page sequence="18">344 Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 approach is that, if successful, it provides a way out ofToadvine's paradox that does not relegate us to an essentially anthropomorphizing position that Barba ras suggests is the inevitable result of any philosophy of perception. Before proceeding, it is important to understand in what sense Merleau Ponty is following a Heideggerian path and in what sense he departs from it. To speak very generally, Heidegger believes that the fault with "metaphysics" is that it fails to distinguish being as such (the ontological domain) from the being of specific beings (the ontic domain), thereby leading to a situation in which "nature" refers both to the totality of existing beings ("nature" as what is) and to what makes beings what they are ("nature" as causal sub strate). While Merleau-Ponty does not want to acknowledge any pure differ ence between the ontic and the ontological,67 he does find in Heidegger the idea that there is a "moving relation between being and a being, a relation that cannot be fixed."68 In other words, precisely because the transcendental conditions for the apprehension of beings as beings affects the perception of the empirical world and vice versa, there will always be a mutable relationship between them, and the being of beings can only be grasped through a specific manner of appearing within a perceptual field. Merleau-Ponty, then, can be said to accept the Heideggerian aletheic conception of truth as simultaneous disclosure-concealment. Additionally, since the flesh idea is formulated within the context of ontological difference, it will also not be synonymous with being itself even if there is an intimate relationship between the ontic and the ontological levels of analysis. In disambiguating flesh and being, we must also take care to avoid equating nature with either or using the concept to elide them. So, following Johnson, we shall seek the commonality between beings in the flesh of things and the flesh of the world thought in terms of internal rela tions. The first step in understanding the flesh of the world and of things in this context is to recall that flesh is a relationship and not itself a being. In a working note from December 1960, "Body and Flesh—Eros—Philosophy of Freudianism," Merleau-Ponty speaks of flesh as "one sole and massive adhesion to Being."69 In speaking of flesh as an "adhesion to Being," we already see that flesh is not Merleau-Ponty's word for being, as is frequently thought. Addi tionally, describing flesh as adhesion indicates that flesh is a manner in which a body relates to other bodies through its immediate contact with them. To "" VI 314/266.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 345 reinforce this interpretation, we can turn to a contemporaneous note, '"Verti cal' and existence," wherein we find a common Merleau-Pontian assertion that bodies within perception are individuated by means of I'ecart, divergence. What is novel in this case is that he goes on to explain that this divergence "is filled precisely by the flesh as the place of emergence of a vision."70 We discover flesh between bodies, and vision emerges as a specific kind of relation between them. Putting these two ideas together, we can say that flesh is a relation between bodies, the connection between them that isolates each as a separate body and yet holds them all together in one world. Perception, as a relation between bodies, is but one singular instance of a more general relationality. In other words, because flesh is an open relationship of affection, vision emerges from flesh as a specific form of openness to other beings. Since all relations occur between singular bodies, each relation will have a specific affective or meaningful character dependent upon the constitution of those bodies, the history between them, etc. For this reason Toadvine and others are correct to assert that there is sense within the world not of human origin, but we must also note that there are horizons of significance for each body formed through its own relations between it and its surroundings. Thus, in a body's encounter with the place that environs it, there is a reciprocal action between bodies, each side of which is both passive and active: on the one hand, a body articu lates a field in which it finds itself (activity), but only insofar as its capacities open upon that field (passivity); on the other hand, the body is affected by its relations with the articulated beings it encounters in the field (passivity); but, insofar as it too is a part of the phenomenal field, the constitution of the field is altered through that affection (activity). To return momentarily to Dastur's attempt to differentiate Heidegger from Merleau-Ponty on this point, we can now see that the two are actually closer together than previously thought. Flesh, conceived as a form of relationship, is a structure that makes possible affective relations, not an experience of a perceiving subject. The reflexive structure of flesh ends up playing an existential role similar to that of attune ment within Heidegger's philosophy, the difference between them being that for Heidegger the structure is an existential of Dasein rather than of corporeal beings in general. The ontological conception of flesh is an attempt to estab lish a radically relational ontology in which the internal relations between bodies are constitutive of a being's identity, while, as for Heidegger, these con stitutive relations are also mobile and fluid. VI 320/270.</page><page sequence="20">346 Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327—357 Merleau-Ponty calls this form of relation the chiasm. I mention this point only because, in the November 1960 note "Time and chiasm," Merleau-Ponty identifies the chiasmic relation with the form of reflexivity described above and immediately proceeds to conclude: "and that itself is the flesh."71 If reflex ive, chiasmic relations are constitutive of flesh, then, rather than hearing "obscure usages" of the term, when Merleau-Ponty speaks of history as flesh,72 the flesh of time,73 the flesh of language,74 flesh as expression,75 etc., we can hear these usages of flesh as describing various forms of relation that are embod ied in different phenomena such as time or history. Thus, speaking of "my flesh" refers both to my body as the medium through which life is lived and the structural relations that organize that life, which is to say there is both a descriptive phenomenological account of flesh as I live it in relation to other things and an ontological account of flesh in terms of the assemblage or nexus of relations that constitute that body as a medium. On this account, however, the ontological conception of flesh is what makes possible the descriptive claims concerning envelopment and composition: if relations were not chias mic, nothing like language, history, or time would be possible. From the preceding analysis, one can draw the conclusion that the essence of flesh does not, properly speaking, lie in the descriptions Merleau-Ponty offers of it. Rather, those descriptions are Merleau-Pontys attempt to express that essence indirectly, to say what flesh is without naming it. In this sense, Hass is correct to call Merleau-Ponty's descriptions of the flesh expressive ges tures, but to do so does not prevent there being a unified sense or essence toward which Merleau-Ponty is gesturing. If an essence is, as Merleau-Ponty claims, to be found at the "joints" or "hinges" that "secretly bind" the myriad "variations" of a phenomenon,76 then the essence of flesh must be found not in what is invariant among the manifestations of flesh but in what holds them all together. The key here is the word "bind [relier·]": in French, as in English, "binding" can refer not only to a connection between discrete individuals but also to the process in which various pages or leaves (feuillets) are assembled into a single volume. The contention, therefore, is that the essence of flesh lies in how these affective relations described above are held together in a single being. VI 315/268. VI 307/258-59. VI 148/111. V7198/153.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327—357 347 We can make this claim more precise by attempting to understand the flesh of things in terms of the ontological sense of flesh. If flesh relations are consti tutive of my body, my flesh, and what is constitutive of my body "already is in every visible,"77 then every visible thing, as a participant in the common, sen sible world, is engaged to some degree in chiasmic relations with other bodies, regardless of whether it appears in a human perceptual field. To be clear, I am claiming that each thing, independent of human sensibility, possesses its own flesh, which is to say that a thing is a collection of relations, which are defined by how it is open to its environs. Merleau-Ponty calls the manner in which a particular body is open to its milieu a dimension, and since consciousness is for Merleau-Ponty an embodied phenomenon, these dimensions can take on an intellectual or sensual character.78 Since different bodies are open to their milieu in distinct ways, every body is a collection of various dimensions through which they can interact with a world. We can now see what Merleau Ponty meant by describing the body as a "dimensional this": my body is an assemblage of relations that organizes its experience in a certain manner, according to the various dimensions through which it has access to a meaning ful world. In the flesh of the human body, chiasmic relations fold over and create an interior dimension that we call consciousness, due to the way we behave given the specific relations between ourselves and other beings.79 While many other beings (e.g., mountains and rivers, not apes and lizards) do not exhibit these sorts of behaviors, we would be remiss to deny a kind of interior ity to things: they still exist according to dimensions.80 However, to attribute interiority does not require the attribution of consciousness or even sentience, as Barbaras or Abram suggest.81 Minimally, the interiority of a thing consists in the hiddenness of the complicity of its relations, in what Toadvine calls its "aloofness"82 or what Barbaras described as the things existence as horizon, although here the horizon is not only for a human perceiver. The interiority of the thing is what leads to the stochastic rather than mechanistic, deterministic function of natural systems: the system can behave in various ways, given the 77) VI 177/136. 7il V7 138/103. 7'" From The Structure of Behavior through to Nature, Merleau-Ponty never abandons defining consciousness as a specific form of animal behavior.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 complicity of the things within the systems hidden internal relations.83 For this reason, Merleau-Ponty calls things "field-beings" or "essences at the level of nature,"84 but each of these determinations requires separate elucidation. First, to call things "field-beings" refers to his shift from a philosophy based upon lived experience to one based upon institution: a field is what is instituted through the openness of a body to its environment. Though Merleau-Ponty admittedly privileges the human perceiving body as an example throughout his corpus, he is equally cautious to contextualize the claims he makes on the basis of such analyses. For example, in the note "Flesh of the world—Flesh of the Body—Being," from May 1960, Merleau-Ponty claims that "the flesh of the world is not explained by the flesh of the body" and goes on to make the even stronger claim that "it is by the flesh of the world that in the last analysis one can understand the lived body."85 While we shall return to this note and the notion of the flesh of the world momentarily, at present what is important is the acknowledgment of an ontological continuity between all beings, since each being is its field or relations, while at the same time providing for their differences by ascribing a distinct set of chiasmic relations to each. Under standing the thing as a field of relations gives them a depth86 and also helps us to understand what it means for a thing to be an essence. Recalling that an essence is how a thing has "a certain style, a certain manner of managing the domain of space and time over which it has competency, of pronouncing, of articulating that domain, of radiating about a wholly virtual center,"87 we can say that a thing, as a essence, is the nexus of flesh relations that constitute it as an individual. We can say more about things, however, since a thing is an essence situated "at the level of nature." In his course on the concept of nature, Merleau-Ponty explicitly defines nature as "pure passage,"88 meaning that nature does not exist as a thing or kind of thing but, rather, that nature Since Merleau-Ponry openly employs Heidegger's aletheic theory of truth, we must under stand the above idea in that context. To say that the network ol relations is hidden from us does not imply that, if we dig deep enough and employ the best science of our times, we will be able to understand these systems in a quasi-deterministic way. Rather, in disclosing the being to our selves in that manner, we are then covering over other relevant aspects of its nature. Ml VI269/220. VI298-99/250. "*' VI268/219. *7) VI152/115.

Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 349 exists as the processes of temporalization and spatialization that occur through the mutual relations obtaining between beings along the dimensions through which they are open to their milieu. As field beings, things are in continual interaction with those other beings around them, and in their interaction they form "a field of fields, with a style and a typic," which produces "non-language significations."89 Calling things "essences of nature," then, is to say that things are the nodes of exchange articulated within a place, within a field of fields. Having explored the notion of the flesh of things, we are now prepared to reformulate the meaning of the flesh of the world. We receive a clue as to what this flesh might be like in the earlier cited note from May 1960 where Merleau-Ponty states, "Flesh of the world, describe (a propos of time, space, movement) as segregation, dimensionality, continuation, latency, encroachment."90 We can characterize the flesh of the world descriptively in terms of time, space and movement; these are, after all, how we predominately experience ourselves in the world. Nonetheless, what allows us to experience the world in these ways are relations that segregate things, the different dimen sions through which things relate to one another, the persistence and mutabil ity of these relations across a duration, the latent processes of relation that we do not perceive, and the ways in which various field-beings encroach upon one another. The implication here is that the flesh of the world is the over arching fabric of space and time that we perceive, made possible by the many fleshes occurring between bodies in a place. To go on to say that "my body is made of the same flesh as the world" and "the flesh of my body is participated in by the world" is simply to say that the body participates in the same kinds of relations as those that obtain between all other things within the field and that the world in turn is the product of these relations. The flesh of the world, then, is "of seen-Being";91 it is the Gestalt formed by the contact between field beings; it is the overlapping of fields that remains pregnant with myriad pos sibilities. As such a Gestalt, the flesh of the world reflects the distribution of beings within its field, but is not reducible to the sum of its parts. This flesh exists insofar as bodies are open to affection and therefore organize a spatial and temporal field about themselves. Ontologically speaking, the flesh of the world is the fabric of space, time, and movement within which we dwell, Nature: Course Notes from the College de France (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2003), 120; hereafter cited as La Nature, followed first by the French then English pagination.

It is not, how ever, a substance out of which beings are composed, since space, time, and movement are themselves relational processes. Our final task is to return to the question of ontological difference in order to clarify the relationship between flesh, nature, and being so as to confirm that we have not once again conflated nature, the being of beings, and being as such. At this point I trust that it is clear in what sense flesh is the word for the being of beings: each being, as a dimensional-this, an essence at the level of nature, is what it is due to its flesh relations with other beings. As these various fleshes interact, they form a distinct horizon around each of the bodies engaging in flesh relations, a horizon of space and time that is the flesh of the world.92 I would like to stress again that this idea of the flesh of the world is not an animistic philosophy. Though all beings, both animate and inanimate, dynamically contribute to the constitution of the flesh of the world, the man ner in which animate and inanimate beings are able to do this differs dra matically. Specifically, I am arguing that "the Flesh" does not exist, especially as an animate substance, and therefore cannot serve as basis for attributing a form of subjectivity to inanimate beings. Rather, there are myriad bodies that simply are their flesh relations and, through their relating, constitute a larger system of relations. Human ontological continuity with the rest of nature is preserved since all bodies share a common nature, i.e., they are their flesh rela tions, but the specificity of various modes of being in the world is also pre served insofar as different bodies are open to different affective dimensions, are susceptible to different affections, and therefore are capable of different behav iors, some of which are "intelligent" or sentient, others of which are not. To discount the differences between beings is, in many ways, just as destructive as ignoring their continuities. With this understanding of flesh in hand, we can now turn to Merleau Ponty's recommendation that nature be reconceived in terms of flesh rather than as a cybernetic or fixed system of ahistorical laws.93 Nature is a process comprised of various fields of fields, but consequently the term has its scope limited: when we speak of nature, we no longer refer to everything that exists, all physical reality, or even a being's causal substrate. For this reason, nature no longer plays the role Heidegger ascribes to it within the philosophical tradi tion, namely, the concept that conflates the being of beings with being as such. Nature is simply the largest field of flesh that provides the living spatio "2&gt; VI 319/271. V7 315/267 and 322/274.</page><page sequence="25">Β. Ε.

In calling nature a field of flesh, however, it is important to maintain the distinc tion between the two concepts: nature neither is constitutive of a beings essence (i.e., it is not flesh proper) nor is nature a specific means of relating to beings (i.e., it is not, like language or history, a particular form of flesh). Nature appears as the "non-instituted," a field of presencing independent of human perception, a field that does not depend upon the various institutions through which humans relate to their worlds, a field that nevertheless is an autoproduction of sense as a result of the interactions between the various constituents of the field.94 If nature is no longer the word for the being of beings, neither does it main tain its role as the word for being as such, since it is just one field of flesh among others. Following Heidegger in this regard, Merleau-Ponty defines being as such as a "universal dimensionality"95 or "the dimensionality itself."96 While it is tempting to hear these expressions as indicating that being is the all-encompassing domain within which all dimensions exist, to do so would once again reify being into the classical conception of nature wherein space time is a container for beings, each with a discreet and objective location within it. On the contrary, to say that being is dimensionality itself indicates that being is both the capacity to be directed toward other fields (consciously or no) in meaningful ways and the "common inner framework" that main tains the openness of a dimension as a dimension. In other words, "to be" means to be open to affectation from other fields along specific affective dimensions. Thus, as was described above, there is a direct relationship between the being of beings and being as such insofar as flesh relations comprise the intercourse of objects within those dimensions, but being remains distinct insofar as it names a potency (i.e., to be open to affectation) in general that only exists as real within the particular relations that engender it. Being as such thereby maintains a relationship with the being of beings without being reified into either a substrate of beings (e.g., being as substance or matter) or a being itself (e.g., being as nature).

Wild Being, Wild Nature The issue we set out to address was the relationship between Merleau-Ponty's late ontology and an environmental ethic. While the inquiry focused pre dominately on resituating the flesh idea within the context of a relational ontology, I hope to have shown how such a recontextualization also leads to a novel conception of nature within the history of philosophy. To conclude, I would like to return to the problems described in the first section concerning employing Merleau-Ponty's ontology in order to develop an environmental ethic, namely, the ontology's supposed anthropomorphism and its non normativity. At the time, I suggested that abandoning the popularly held interpretation of flesh as a perceptual phenomenon within sentient experience in favor of a general theory of affection formulated in terms of internal consti tutive relations would resolve the difficulties. Now that the theory has been developed in the previous section through the analysis of the flesh of things and the flesh of the world, it will be possible to answer those challenges and develop the consequences. The anthropomorphism issue is the more vexing. As Toadvine's investiga tions show, even self-conscious attempts to overcome anthropomorphism can relapse into it surreptitiously. To recapitulate, the concern is that any theoretical inquiry into the nature of nature subjects the world to a human perceptual and conceptual constitution that frames and structures our intu itions of nature. The danger of this epistemological situation lies in making a category mistake whereby the constitution of a body within the human per ceptual field is mistaken for a characteristic of the world in general. Thus, if the flesh is a perceptual relationship established through auto-affection, to take flesh as the structure or substance of reality is to project the reflexive structure of human perception onto every being. On the other hand, according to the proposed transformation of the concept, perception is but one manifestation of a general form of relation, and flesh neither requires sentience nor reduces all beings to their appearance to a sentient observer. Beings will engage in spatializing and temporalizing relations regardless of human (or any sentient being's) presence. When discussing human knowledge of the natural world, we must still be continually vigilant against our anthropomorphizing tenden cies, but there is nothing inherently anthropomorphic concerning the onto logical claim that a being is the nexus of relations that affect it through the dimensions of its body.97 However, given this view, a lingering question is, what transformations are necessary within phenomenological methodology in order to adapt it to a more general theory of affection?</page><page sequence="27">Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 353 Even if this anthropomorphism is overcome, however, it remains unclear how this ontology provides a basis for normative judgments. Indeed, more traditional environmental ethicists oriented toward the preservation of a pris tine nature might find this interpretation of Merleau-Ponty's ontology to be unhelpful. After all, if nature is a protean field without either any fixed con figuration or intrinsic relationships, there is no one state of this field that is more "natural" than any other, and therefore the normative principle that humans ought to allow nature to be in its "natural" state loses its foundation. Moreover, since human actions occur within the field of nature and are there fore natural, those actions are at least partially constitutive of what nature is. It seems, then, that there is no way to harm nature, since even destructive human interventions within it are merely initiating a new set of relations and not eliminating the field of nature itself. Nature merely becomes humanized, but there is no "end of nature." Though "naturalness" is lost as a normative criterion, I do not view this as a problem as the ontology opens up less dualistic ways of evaluating human interventions within the field of nature. More traditional environmental eth ics has revolved around questions of moral considerability, that is, whether there is a metaphysical basis for extending the circle of moral concern to beings other than humans, how far that circle can be extended, whether extending the circle is even desirable for an environmental ethic, what kinds of obliga tions do humans have to preserve nature, etc. By removing the oppositional definition of humanity and nature and the consequent loss of nature as both a normative ground and as a being, the content of our ethical deliberations can move in different directions, namely, toward describing what it might mean to contribute positively to nature. Since human beings are inextricably part of the field of nature, the ethical debates should revolve less around how to pre serve a nature without humans and more around how best to engage with nature, how to leave a non-trivial space within nature for non-human forms of life, how to live with the changing face of the Earths geology and atmo sphere without attempting to master it, etc. Toadvine expresses the issue nicely in saying that reconceiving the human relationship to nature as Merleau-Ponty does "can lead to an entirely different conception of ethics, one that circles less around principles of moral obligation and that instead concerns our dwelling within the world."98 A first step in cultivating such an ethic would be, as many philosophers have prescribed, to turn to a place-centered approach in which specific norms of behavior are developed that are appropriate for the specific inhabited Toadvine, Mcrlcau-Ponty's Philosophy of Nature, 134.</page><page sequence="28">354 Β. Ε. Βαηηοη / Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327—357 landscape. If one accepts theories of place like those of Yi-Fu Titan or Edward S. Casey, which maintain no hard and fast distinction between nature and culture, then it is possible to cultivate a new way of thinking about what might be "wild" within a given place and what is valuable about that wildness. "Wildness" might then, as Thoreau famously suggested, serve as a more fertile ethical benchmark than a concept of wilderness that requires a nature-culture distinction. As a field of fields, a place possesses certain qualities depending upon the relations that obtain within it. The wildness of such a place can be defined in terms of the places ability to sustain and proliferate a variety of tem poralities formed through the presence of diverse fleshes. Understood in this way, wildness would not preclude human presence as long as human dwelling fosters conditions under which other forms of life (and geography) can flour ish and evolve within their own temporal scale. We would no longer be forced into the dualistic dilemma of choosing between the seemingly incompatible ideals of removing all traces of humanity from a place or of accepting human managerial practices in order to preserve pristine wilderness. We might even set as an aim the cultivation of wild places within our predominately human places in order to re-welcome non-human forms of life and styles of living within our own communities and thereby enrich them. While there would no longer be any "pure nature," accepting the ecological vision of nature as flesh offers a different perspective upon the human presence within nature and richer possibilities for creating human lifestyles that are less speciesist and ecocidal. Another important benefit of breaking with the anthropomorphism inher ent within the experiential approach is that it allows us to develop an ethic within which time itself becomes a relevant category of ethical consideration. Considering time in this way proves especially helpful within an environmen tal context. If flesh relations are always between singular bodies and these relations are spatializing and temporalizing, then within any given field there will be multiple temporal scales at work. Usually, our ethical considerations concerning nature only take account of a human temporal scale, but ecologi cal systems, precisely because they are complex systems of interrelationships between beings, are operating within, and changing along, multiple temporal scales simultaneously. If the plurality of temporal relations is ignored, then even well-intentioned and skillfully executed conservation projects may fail to promote wildness. If, for example, an ecological restoration project orients itself toward reestablishing the biological conditions that obtained at a specific point from within human history, this pursuit might neglect the ways in which species and geography have changed in the intervening period, result in the</page><page sequence="29">Β. Ε. Βαηηοη /Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357 355 eradication of certain species that were not present at that historical period but could reside within the system without damaging its integrity, or create condi tions under which continual human intervention is necessary in order to pre serve the system in its restored state due to a loss of surrounding systems that would interact with the restored system in order to maintain its stability. If efforts were, rather, to focus as much on reestablishing conditions within which a multiplicity of temporal orders were possible contemporaneously, the restored system could possess a novel integrity capable of supporting myriad living forms. Rather than proceeding into the future oriented by nostalgia for a world without humanity, Merleau-Ponty's ontology gestures toward a world in which humanity, in the idiom of Aldo Leopold, is a good citizen within the land community. Obviously these concluding remarks require further development and elab oration, but to do so in the current context would take us too far afield from the subject of the current investigation. I hope to have shown how the prof fered interpretation of Merleau-Ponty's notion of flesh might contribute to a non-anthropomorphic ontology that could support the kinds of normative claims that environmental ethicists seek to make. While I believe that these proposals are in keeping with the spirit of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, my concern has not been to give a precise account of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy such that the interpretation contained within is beyond all textual contesta tion. Rather, I hope the alternative way of thinking about Merleau-Ponty's ideas will increase their relevance to the problems we face today. In this light, we might ask ourselves what kind of role do we desire to play within the flesh of the world? I for one would prefer to imagine a nature in which humanity collectively cultivates beauty rather than facilitates its destruction. Principal Works Cited Abram, David.
