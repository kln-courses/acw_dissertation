<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Portrait of the Modernist as a Young Aesthete: Faulkner's Mosquitoes Claus Daufenbach ABSTRACT Since its publication in 1927, Mosquitoes, Faulkner's second published novel, has been re- garded as one of his least successful literary achievements. Most critics who have focused on the Yoknapatawpha myth and that miraculously productive fifteen-year period 1928-1942 during which Faulkner wrote those novels which rank among the indisputably major works of American literature, tend to regard Mosquitoes, and indeed his entire early work, as an embarrassingly decadent and negligible deviation.1 Despite its obvious flaws, however, it seems overly simplistic to dismiss Mosquitoes as a failure tout court. Not only the novel's firmly structured and intri- cately patterned textual arrangement deserves our critical attention but, above all, the kind of aesthetic values that preoccupied Faulkner into his late twenties.2 It is certainly no mistake to ex- amine Faulkner's early prose experiments for what they can suggest about the maturation of his aesthetic and for their formative effects on his later career. Furthermore, Faulkner's apprentice- ship novel about the artistic bohemia of the Vieux Carré should be read within the framework of cultural attitudes and artistic practices that conditioned a whole generation of young artists marked by a peculiar brand of disappointed idealism and aestheticism. In this context, my essay will focus on the heavily stylized portrait of New Orleans and on the impact of Faulkner's choice of sculpture as the central image of art in this novel. Decadent Cityscape In a programmatic essay published by the New Orleans Double Dealer in 1922, Sher- wood Anderson, then already a successful novelist and resident of New Orleans, strove to evoke the unique atmosphere of the city. His text creates an unmistakable scenery and an almost elegiac mood which differs radically from the prevailing urban experi- ence of the early twentieth century. New Orleans, Anderson claims, is a place where creative imagination has not yet come up against "the facts of life" - a term which for Anderson indicates the supremacy of obtuse, materialistic values causing the dissipa- tion of any true non-utilitarian creativity. The rejection of "the facts of life" and the praise of a mode of existence both sensually pleasing and stimulating the "play of the 1 Even the recently published Cambridge Companion to William Faulkner entirely ignores Faulkner's early period before The Sound and the Fury (1928) and the later work after the publi- cation of Go Down, Moses (1942).

I stick to my pronouncement that culture means first of all the enjoyment of life, leisure and a sense of leisure. It means time for the play of the imagination over the facts of life."3 Anderson emphasizes the regenerative and creative capacity inherent in New Orleans by comparing it with Pittsburgh and Chicago, two in- dustrial cities that serve as a repulsive contrast to his eulogy of New Orleans. The con- frontation of these differing urban concepts and the juxtaposition of key terms such as "leisure" and "play of the imagination" with Chicago's "joy of growth and achieve- ment," characterized by Anderson as "less subtle" and "more stupid,"4 serve to reify the exceptional position of New Orleans within the context of the emerging American metropolis of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During this phase, which marks the transition of the United States to an urban in- dustrial society, to a "cityscape" expressive of the "special affinity" between America and "the machine,"5 as Leo Marx called it, the literary image of the metropolis is dominated by dynamic energies, new technologies and an often unscrupulous materi- alism. Theodore Dreiser's Chicago with its "spectacle of new, raw, necessary life"6 and Dos Passos's "steaming asphalt city"7 mirror a new urban consciousness which in- cluded optimism and vitality but more often expressed a deep sense of social anxiety and human alienation. The literary descriptions of New Orleans, however, counter this breathtaking urban development with a retrospective dimension that seemed alien to a nation so exclu- sively preoccupied with progress and the future, or at least with the commonplace re- alities of the present. Under the spell of the city's "voluptious inertia," as Faulkner puts it in his early fragmentary novel Elmer, even "those who had the virus of Pro- gress in their blood" can only go through "their ritual of efficiency with tongue in cheek."8 William Faulkner, Sherwood Anderson's protégé during his stay in New Or- leans in 1925 and 1926, was obviously fascinated by this picturesque and cosmopolitan city, by its semi-tropical luxuriance, its variety of nationalities and races, and its rich Franco-Spanish tradition. At the same time, the cultural revival of New Orleans in the 1920s, which belied H. L. Mencken's somewhat malicious characterization of the South as a "Sahara of the Bozart,"9 stimulated Faulkner's literary productivity. In fact, New Orleans is the only major city repeatedly described by Faulkner in the 1920s and 1930s.

Here the thematic continuity and the aesthetic treatment of the city-motif are closely related to each other. New Orleans seems to function as the symbolic fa- cade of a stylized late romantic South embellished with the connotations of an exoti- cally decadent metropolis: "... that city foreign and paradoxical with its atmosphere at once fatal and languorous."10 Just as the "ante-bellum" city in Absalom, Absalom!, the modern New Orleans of the Twenties, the "Jazz Age," is characterized by a term which, since the publication of Verlaine's sonnet "Langueur" (1883), had been estab- lished as one of the trademarks of European decadence. New Orleans emerges "slum- brous beneath the decadent languor of August and evening."11 It is not only the repetition of such keywords which serves to create this mysteri- ously decadent flair, but also the atmospheric accumulation of twilight and evening scenes, of decline and decay. It is obvious, however, that Faulkner's rhetoric and artis- tic taste, influenced by his early lyric experiments with late romantic poetry,12 does not simply treat such elusive phases of transition and decline ironically as obsolete clichés but rather seems inclined to savor their aesthetic appeal and implications. The main techniques in these early prose texts are primarily poetic both in intention and in ef- fect, aiming at the establishment of a total pattern of imagery through an almost ob- sessive recurrence of significant phrases, symbols, and motifs. Obviously, the young author who had not yet come home to his "little postage stamp of native soil"13 ac- cepted late romantic imagery as a poetic shorthand for evoking the mood of the city, just as in his later novel Pylon (1935) he drew heavily on the imagery of T. S. Eliot's Waste Land in order to depict a corrupted modern version of New Orleans. Among the most striking rhetorical figures in this context are the conspicuous sy- naesthetic constructions so frequently used in Faulkner's early work. As in the follow- ing example, "The violet dusk held in soft suspension lights slow as bellstrokes" (MOS 14), synaesthesia with its transmutation and blending of sensory perceptions imparts a sense of vaguely spiritual suggestiveness to these twilight scenes. At the same time, the use of rather unambiguously trenchant motifs, such as "the moon of decay and death" (MOS 8), hovering portentously over the nocturnal city, or the image of "stars like cast roses arrested above an open coffin,"14 illustrates the young writer's ostentatious delight in a display of morbid effects. Other passages show his attempt to emphasize the city's dreamlike quality and its stupefying sensual impact, so when he mentions 10 William Faulkner, A bsalom, A bsalom!

The deviation from the geometrical impersonality of the contemporary metropoli- tan stereotype, however, is not solely confined to atmospheric details. In a city domi- nated by "an atmosphere of mellow richness and soft laughter," as Faulkner describes it in his "Foreword" to Sherwood Anderson and Other Famous Creoles,16 the substitu- tion of organic for mechanistic modes of representation informs the entire cityscape itselt The contours of human habitat and natural environment merge into each other and are visualized in anthropomorphic imagery: "The shore and river curved away like the bodies of two dark sleepers embracing, curved one to another in slumber ..." (MOS 47). New Orleans thus provided Faulkner with a unique model for the recon- ciliation of urban life with organic nature. It offered him the opportunity to create a more internally "natural" city in a way reminiscent of the traditional American dialec- tic of urban and non-urban existence and, more specifically perhaps, of Emerson's "organic city."17 In Faulkner's case, however, the term "organic" has to be modified. As we have al- ready noted, his New Orleans is a city not of exuberant vitality, of strong colors or harsh sounds, but of lassitude and the subtle play of that characteristic "quiet vitiating twilight soft and oppressive as smoke."18 The following nocturnal scene from the "Prologue" of Mosquitoes with its shifting spatial relations and tonal values may serve as a striking illustration of this assessment: Looking through the tall pickets into Jackson Square was like looking into an aquarium - a moist and motionless absinthe-cloudy green of all shades from inkblack to a thin and rigid feathering of silver on pomegranate and mimosa - like coral in a tideless sea, amid which globular lights hung dull and unstraying as jellyfish, incandescent yet without seem- ing to emanate light; and in the center of it Andrew's baroque plunging stasis nimbused about with thin gleams as though he too were recently wetted. (MOS 49) The reader's perception is absorbed by an enclosed space entirely defined through the interplay of color modulations, a light of opalescent tints and a peculiarly diaphonous quality, reducing all objects to a state of vague suspension. While complementary at- tributes like "motionless," "tideless," and "unstraying," with their explicit negation of movement, evoke a meditative atmosphere, the equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson at the end of this quotation appears within a paradoxical combination of stasis and 15 Faulkner, Elmer 383.

It is, however, symptomatic in this context that the sculpture itself is not so much characterized by three-dimensional plasticity - like all the other objects it rather dissolves in a "nimbus" of mellow luminosity. The aesthetic stylization of New Orleans does not only surface in such descriptive passages. As a narrative device, it also informs the retrospective mentality of the nar- rators in those early prose poems published under the summary title "New Orleans."19 As a collective portrait, melodious in diction, romantic in themes and world-weary in tone, these short monologues are intended to convey an idea of the city's true nature. With their retrospective point of view, they thematize remembrance and oblivion as the basis and motivation of their poetic discourse. Both the exotic Judaism of "The Wealthy Jew" and the equally extravagant Catholicism of "The Priest" demonstrate the young author's deliberate attempt to break away from the provincial confines of his hometown, Oxford, Mississippi, and the Baptist religiousness of the rural South. It is obvious, I think, that these prose poems were not written in order to convey a sense of orthodox religiousness. Instead, the montage of spiritual and sensual elements indi- cates a heightened sensibility towards the aesthetic modifications of religious cult and ritual. It furthermore serves as a pretext for unusual attitudes and an exoticism all the more striking in an American text of the mid-1920s. For the early Faulkner, this exotic foreignness could only be adequately realized within a New Orleans setting. For the artist who had chided the America of his time as "aesthetically impossible"20 and de- void of tradition, New Orleans with its specific cultural heritage and its suggestive at- mosphere provided an ideal background for the integration of his stylized prose ex- periments into an American context. Here the contextual forces of history and culture, and the prior uses of language comprise a set of paradigms inscribing themselves into the text. Faulkner's affinities with late romantic modes of representation are perhaps most clearly indicated by the specific personifications assigned to the city. In Absalom, Ab- salom/, one of his major novels of the 1930s, Charles Bon's magnolia-faced "octoroon mistress" embodies the aura of the antebellum city and functions as the compelling antithesis to Henry Sutpen's puritan ethic. An earlier example of this female type ap- pears with the quadroon prostitute of his prose sketch "Peter."21 It is hardly surprising that Faulkner's interest does not center on a realistic account of the sordid aspects of prostitution. Instead, he uses the figure as a convenient opportunity for poetic styliza- tion and atmospheric description. That Faulkner did in fact intend this female type to suggest and personify the dis- tinctive ambiance of New Orleans becomes apparent in his early "New Orleans" prose poems, where the city is explicitly identified with a courtesan of enigmatically indeterminable age: "New Orleans. A courtesan, not old and yet no longer 19 See the sequence of prose poems titled "New Orleans" in Faulkner's New Orleans Sketches 3-14. 20 William Faulkner, "Books and Things: American Drama: Inhibitions" [1922], Early Prose and Poetry, ed.

She reclines gracefully upon a dull brocaded chaise-longue, there is the scent of incense about her, and her draperies are arranged in formal folds. She lives in an atmosphere of a bygone and more gracious age.23 This description not only sums up the retrospective attitude of Faulkner's early New Orleans writings - its passive and sultry suggestiveness seems to function as a nega- tion of the American metropolis of his time and perhaps even of American existence tout court. An almost identical scenery, including an allusion to the "weariness motif" of James Joyce's "Villanelle of the Temptress,"24 features in the "Prologue" to Faulk- ner's Mosquitoes and establishes that attractive, yet melancholy and somewhat lascivi- ous mood of the city: "Outside the window New Orleans, the vieux carré, brooded in a faintly tarnished languor like an aging yet still beautiful courtesan in a smokefilled room, avid yet weary too of ardent ways" (MOS 10). Faced with the accumulation of decadent imagery, echoes of the so-called "dead cities" of fin-de-siècle Europe25 are quite obvious. And there is indeed in Faulkner's early work a striking indication of the intrinsic similarity between New Orleans and the decadent city par excellence, Venice. In Faulkner's fragmentary novel Elmer the protagonist, an American dilettante painter, spends a few days in Venice. The Italian city is introduced with images which immediately recall the "voluptious inertia" and the "decadent languor" of New Or- leans: "Venice looked like voluptious lace . . . that colored city dreaming upon that blue and green sea .... Walls were hushed shades of color blending like tuned instru- ments beneath an intimate afternoon in a Ledaesque languor . . . ,"26 As a historical, aesthetic and atmospheric phenomenon, Venice offered the chance for an imaginative renunciation of a banal reality and thus served a function identical with that of its American urban counterpart. The overbearing suggestiveness of the city stimulates El- mer's imagination. During a nocturnal ramble, he finally conjures up images of an ex- otic procession whose phantasmagoric irreality corresponds with the fairy-tale scenery surrounding him. What is remarkable about this hallucinatory procession is the fact that only one year later Faulkner transfers all its essential components to the "Epilogue" of his New Or- leans novel Mosquitoes.21 The apparently effortless transposition of this mythopoeic material from fairy-tale Venice to the American city of the Twenties illustrates the ex- tent to which New Orleans, just like Venice, offered the young author the means to- wards an imaginative transformation of the constraints of contemporary reality. There is, however, one major difference between the handling of these elements in Elmer and Mosquitoes. In Mosquitoes, they are explicitly connected with the artist theme of the novel. The mythopoeic component is no longer an end in itself; it now serves a new 22 William Faulkner, "The Tourist" [1925], New Orleans Sketches 13-14; 13. 23 Faulkner, "The Tourist" 13-14. 24 James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1914-15; New York: Viking, 1968) 223-24. 25 See Hans Hinterhäuser, "Tote Städte," Fin de Siècle: Gestalten und Mythen (München: Fink, 1977) 45-76. 26 Faulkner, Elmer 413, 414, 417. 27 Cf.

In Faulkner's early work, New Orleans thus provided the exem- plary background for the solution of an aesthetic problem which occupied him throughout his career, the symbolic modification of realistic prose. In this sense, indeed, the city appears as a place where "the play of the imagination," to use the phrase from Sherwood Anderson's essay, has not yet yielded to "the facts of life." Sculpture: Torso and Androgyny Mosquitoes is the first of Faulkner's novels which fully explores the complex rela- tions between life and language, between the actuality of experience and the unreality of words. Although this antagonism is never finally resolved in Faulkner's work, he tries to cope with the ensuing dilemma through the creation of another idiom: the id- iom of art. When Gordon, the only authentic artist in Mosquitoes, who, some critics have argued, might represent "the writer's ideal self,"28 describes his marble torso as "my feminine ideal: a virgin with no legs to leave me, no arms to hold me, no head to talk to me" (MOS 26), his definition is not simply intended as a persiflage of the other characters' trivial loquacity about the "untrammeled spirit of art" (MOS 26). It also indicates an important aesthetic aspect of modern fragmentary sculpture. Gordon's in- determinacy articulates a modernist consciousness in so far as it questions traditional types of representation and sidesteps the act of mimetic definition. Following Auguste Rodin's innovations, sculptors had deliberately abandoned the concept of a mimetically "complete" human portrait. The ideal of completion and per- fection was thus no longer dictated by established norms or codified sujets, but de- pended entirely on the subjective decision of the artist. By isolating a section of the organic whole and declaring this fragment to be perfect and complete, the superficial illusion of reality is replaced by the autonomous reality of the artifact.29 Faulkner's awareness of these tendencies is revealed by a dialogue which takes place in Gordon's studio. Contemplating the marble statue, the sculptor and two of his artist friends discuss the conflict between fragmentary creation and public taste: "Leda clasping her duck between her thighs could yet be carved out of it " "Swan," corrected Fairchild. "No. Duck," the Semitic man insisted. "Americans would prefer a duck. Or udders and a fig leaf might be added to the thing as it stands. Isn't that possible, Gordon?" (MOS 318) The dialogue indicates the postwar generation's recoil from the philistinism of a bur- geoning mass culture as one of the general impulses which link early modernism's in- 28 André Bleikasten, The Ink of Melancholy: Faulkner's Novels from The Sound and the Fury to Light in August (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1990) 28. 29 See Werner Schnell, Der Torso als Problem der modernen Kunst (Berlin: Gebr.

In these sarcastic comments, the pub- lic appears unable and unwilling to understand the intentional creation of a "non-fin- ished" art-form and to accept the fragmentary sculpture as a genuine expression of ar- tistic experience. Mediocrity longs instead for the supposed security of a sujet, for the reliability of a historically or mythologically established cult-object. Neither autono- mous form nor creative originality are cherished by the public but the genre-piece and its anecdotic banalities are. In the context of Faulkner's novel, however, the reality of the fragment is not a fragmentary reality which could be complemented by the addition of the figure's head and its missing limbs or the inclusion of further paraphernalia. The author's interest centers not on the realistic components of statuary but on its abstract implications, on the tension between realistic representation and abstract formal proportion, and thus on a more stylized set of conventions. It is, in fact, Faulkner's strategy of mimetic reduction, his negation of the traditional means of identification which enables us to identify the essence of the "virginal breastless torso" (MOS 11), its androgyny and rigid purity, with young Patricia Robyn, the girl who has obsessed Gordon's imagination. Both the sculptor and the girl intui- tively grasp this analogy. "It's like me!" she exclaims, while Gordon "examined with growing interest her flat breast and belly Sexless, yet somehow vaguely troubling" (MOS 24). To Gordon, the androgynous girl appears as a "grave and sexless replica of his own attitude" (MOS 269), while Patricia experiences a peculiar attraction towards the marble statue - an attraction not just casually expressed in abstract terms, but evi- dent at the same time in a compulsive, almost ritualistic physical closeness: "Her hand, as if it were a separate organism, reached out slowly, stroking the marble." (MOS 25) The niece put both her firm tanned hands on the marble, hard, hard. О beautiful, she whispered .... (MOS 30) This correspondence is further intensified when Gordon, lifting the girl up in his arms, suddenly visualizes her body as "an ecstasy in golden marble" (MOS 82). The transformation of female body into sculptural form functions as a consistent escala- tion in the stylizing of this androgynous figure, releasing it, as it were, from the tran- sience and triviality of life.30 The mode of stylization indicated here is already prepared for by the environment in which the torso first appears. The mythic tendencies informing Faulkner's descrip- tion of the sculptor's studio remove this setting from the historical reality of the Twen- ties and at the same time provide an aura of timeless transcendence: The studio has "walls which had housed slaves long ago, slaves long dead and dust with the age that had produced them ... - shades of servants and masters now in a more gracious re- gion, lending dignity to eternity" (MOS 11). The mannered accumulation of rhetorical devices serves to express the specific ambiance of this location. Both the alliterative 30 Given the recent interest in gender studies, Faulkner's lifelong obsession with androgyny has again received some critical attention. See Susan V.

At the same time, the notion of timeless duration evoked in Faulkner's presentation of the studio directs the reader's attention to the artifact created there, Gordon's mar- ble torso, which seems to absorb our spatial perception of the scene. Within the singu- lar atmosphere of the studio, the artifact itself attains an almost spiritual quality and is turned into an art-icon: "As you entered the room the thing drew your eyes: . . . mo- tionless and passionately eternal - the virginal breastless torso of a girl, headless, arm- less, legless, in marble temporarily caught and hushed yet passionate still for escape, passionate and simple and eternal . . ." (MOS 11). But why did Faulkner put such an emphasis on sculpture and sculptural form in his early ironic portrait of bohemian New Orleans? The question cannot simply be an- swered by reference to the biographical information available to us.31 What seems rather more decisive is an important aspect of late romantic aesthetics with which Faulkner, the "failed poet," was familiar through his Pre-Raphaelite "études," his Swinburne adaptations and Verlaine translations. For the sensibility of the late nineteenth century, sculpture had exerted a profound fascination as the appropriate symbol of a new and intensified formal significance.32 In an outspoken rejection of the romantic poetics of emotion and inspiration, both sculpture and poetry were now conceived as sharing a common axiom: the achieve- ment of formal perfection in the face of the resistance of their specific medium, be it language or marble. This convergence of poetic form, sculptural terminology, and the image of the poet as craftsman is, perhaps, best illustrated by Swinburne's comment on his own "Ballad of Dreamland," a poem remarkable for its mannered structural density with only three rhymes repeated in its 28 lines, "the Ballad . . . which is one of the most finished examples of workmanship I ever 'sculpted.'"33 In France, "le Parnasse" and especially Théophile Gautier expressed the analogy between marble and poetic form: "Le marbre et le vers sont deux matières également dures à travailler, mais les seules qui gardent éternellement la forme qu'on leur con- fie."34 It therefore comes as no surprise to hear d'Albert, the protagonist of Gautier's novel Mademoiselle de Maupin, emphatically declare that he takes pleasure only in three things: "Trois choses me plaisent: l'or, le marbre et le pourpre, éclat, solidité, couleur."35 31 For biographical information on Faulkner and the artist circle in New Orleans, see Joseph Blotner, Faulkner: Λ Biography, 2 vols.

Boshot (Paris: Garnier, 1955) 190.</page><page sequence="10">556 Claus Daufenbach Characteristically, Faulkner, who possessed an English translation of Mademoiselle de Maupin, adopts this quotation and assigns to it a privileged position in Mosquitoes. In the "Epilogue" of the novel we find the first part of d'Albert's pronouncement re- peated three times, almost like a magic spell. Immediately after the evocation of crea- tive genius as "that Passion Week of the heart" (MOS 338), the entire Gautier quota- tion is integrated in order to juxtapose the emotional appeal of these words and, at the same time, to serve as an aesthetic conclusion to the scene: "I love three things: gold, marble and purple - ... form solidity color ..." (MOS 340). The slight but sig- nificant modification of the French original is all the more revealing. In Faulkner's version, Gautier 's "éclat" is changed into "form." This displacement of "splendor" by "form" once again ingeniously underlines the striving for plasticity and formal aware- ness in both sculpture and poetic diction, thus establishing the craftsman, the "homo faber," as a model not only for the fine arts but for literature as well. At the same time, the concept of marble purity and sculptural stability compensates for the novel's often cynical verbosity and, on a deeper level, seems to serve as a bal- ance to the defeatist sense, to the notion of a world suffused with death and dying, that informs the novels of the "lost generation" from Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and e. e. cummings's The Enormous Room to Dos Passos's Three Soldies and, of course, Faulkner's own first novel, Soldiers' Pay. Bearing this in mind, let us consider for a moment Gordon's only other creation mentioned in its relation to the marble torso: the clay bust of wealthy Mrs. Maurier, whose passion for collecting artists is matched only by her penchant for platitudes about art. It was clay, yet damp, and from out its dull, dead grayness Mrs. Maurier looked at them. Her chins, harshly, and her flaccid jaw muscles with savage verisimilitude. Her eyes were caverns thumbed with two motions into the dead familiar astonishment of her face; and yet behind them, somewhere within those empty sockets, behind all her familiar surprise there was something else - something that exposed her face for the mask it was, and still more, a mask unaware. (MOS 322) Not only the two objects represented - on the one hand, the mimetically fragmented androgynous figure, and on the other hand, the more or less "realistic" portrait of a foolish elderly woman - but also the material chosen in each case indicate a basic dif- ference. The gray, earthen, yet still damp clay, ready to preserve the fleeting expression of a moment, is contrasted with the pure rigid marble and lends an almost bozetto- like quality to the bust. But the spontaneous, violently executed moulding, "eyes . . . caverns thumbed with two motions," is not solely confined to the representation of re- alistic details. Its "savage verisimilitude" exposes an essential truth about the masklike artificiality of Mrs. Maurier's existence and instigates the imaginative attempt to re- construct and evaluate her past. Whenever both of Gordon's sculptures are mentioned in Faulkner criticism, the re- alistic tendencies of the clay bust are used to depricate the stylized torso, this "being without wisdom, freedom or life,"36 or, as Judith B. Wittenberg puts it a little less dras- 36 Edwin T.

The marble fragment has certainly not become obsolete with the appearance of the clay portrait. Not only does the torso remain present throughout the novel on the basis of its early identification with Patricia Robyns, but it even reappears in a remarkable scene in the "Epilogue" of Mosquitoes. During the so-called "Walpurgisnacht" sequence, that hallucinatory ramble through the Vieux Carré, Gordon enters a brothel and lifts up one of the waiting girls against the nocturnal sky: ". . . they saw him . . . lift a woman from the shadow and raise her against the mad stars . . ." (MOS 338-39). Immediately, the realistic background is transformed and, in an italicized passage, the image of the torso is again evoked: "Then voices and sounds, shadows and echoes change form swirling, becoming the headless, armless, legless torso of a girl, motionless and virginal and passionately eternal before the shadows and echoes whirl away" (MOS 339). The carefully arranged atmos- pherical ingredients of this passage and the striking sound pattern with its repetitions and rhymes emphasize the suggestive impact of the scene. Whereas the specific word- ing of the fragmentary form, "headless, armless, legless" recalls Gordon's earlier de- scription of his statue as "a virgin with no legs ... no arms ... no head," the final at- tributes "virginal . . . eternal" now indicate spiritual rather than representational quali- ties of the torso. This is compounded by the tripartite movement from dissolution to form and back to dissolution again. The interplay of Apollonian and Dionysian asso- ciations, in which voices and shadows "change form swirling . . . becoming the . . . torso of a girl . . . before the shadows and echoes whirl away" can no longer be fully ex- plained in terms of rational apperception. As early as the introductory scene of the "Prologue" in Gordon's studio, the marble torso had generated a disquieting tension between immovable fixity and rapid move- ment: "But it was marble, it could not move. And when you tore your eyes away and turned your back on it at last, you got again untarnished and high and clean that sense of swiftness, of space encompassed" (MOS 11). A crucial balance is achieved be- tween human vitality and the stillness of the medium, between "overflowing turbulent energy, and marmorean stillness," to quote the words used by William Butler Yeats to convey his idea of "the nobleness of the arts."38 In the passage from the "Walpurgis- nacht" sequence cited above, this paradoxical tension inherent in the marble is con- verted into a vortex-like image. The center of the vortex, the point of highest energy- concentration, described by Ezra Pound as the focus of artistic creativity - "the hard point, the true centre, out of which a fine thing may come at any time"39 - is reserved for the marble statue. 37 Judith B.

The negation of chronological succession seems to dissolve the established categories of time and space. Thus, the artifact itself creates its own aesthetic time, and in doing so, antici- pates the very function which, in Faulkner's later novels, will be attributed to Keats's "Grecian Urn."40 As an emblematic icon, defining the artist as male and the object of artistic desire as female, the torso in Mosquitoes foreshadows Faulkner's obsessive use of urns, vases, and images of containment to define not just woman but art and the creative process in general - a concept perhaps best exemplified by Caddy Compson, that "frail doomed vessel,"41 in The Sound and the Fury, the novel closest to his heart: I said to myself, Now I can write. Now I can make myself a vase like that which the old Roman kept at his bedside and wore the rim slowly away with kissing it. So I, who had never had a sister and was fated to lose my daughter in infancy, set out to make myself a beautiful and tragic little girl.42 40 See Joan Korenman, "Faulkner's Grecian Urn," The Southern Literary Journal 7 (1974): 3- 23; Susan V.
