<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rhetoric of Anarcho-Nihilistic Murder: Thomas Bernhardt Das Kalkwerk Robert S. Leventhal In the fifth book of the Ideen (1784)1 Herder writes: "Unter allen Thieren ist das Geschöpf der feinsten Organe, der Mensch, der größeste Mörder. Er kann beinah alles, was an lebendiger Organisation nur nicht zu tief unter ihm steht, in seine Natur verwandeln." The transformation Herder speaks of in this passage, the destruction and appropriation of lower forms of existence into the "human" world, employs murder metaphorically as a necessary affirmative attribute of human cognition. For Herder this transfor mation of nature was one aspect of a theory of analogical understanding in which even the most inaccessible elements of nature could be taken up and understood as parts of a global human world: such a transformative-appro priative activity was responsible for the insights of science and for creativity in the arts. As inventor of images, analogies and metaphors the human being ultimately transforms all of nature into a model in its own image. The poet as creator is also a murderer, destroying preexisting dominance and rulership— that of nature, the inherited tradition, the power of the Gods or political authority (the Church, the Princes)-in order to create a new model of the world. For the young Goethe and Herder this destructive creativity and its implicit "Romantic Hermeneutics" of divination and appropriation consti tuted the break from the traditional aesthetics of mimesis that had governed poetic production until the second half of the eighteenth century: suddenly the individual historical subject was placed above poetic rules and codes of propriety. The advent of a vocabulary of Tätigkeit and Reflexion character izes the German Sturm und Drang: the figure of the artist-scientist-philoso pher as a creative-destructive force, breaking apart the established network of transmitted meanings and creating an individual, highly idiosyncratic, and anthropomorphic perception of the world, became central to the emergence of modern "subjectivity" in German intellectual history at this time. That this model of modern subjectivity as a destructive power should reemerge in contemporary literature and literary theory in an extremely volatile and problematical form comes as no surprise. Recent critics have Modern Austrian Literature, Volume 21, Nos. 3/4,1988 19</page><page sequence="2">20 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE spoken of the relation between contemporary forms of literary discourse and representation and those of the latter eighteenth century, Romanticism in particular.2 Secondly, the category of "representation" (mimesis), once thought by critics such as M. H. Abrams to be replaced at the end of the eighteenth century by an "expressive" theory of art,3 has again become the subject of literary theory, although in a new key: mimesis in contemporary theory is understood not as representation of Nature (Nachahmung), but as the structure of desire and value and a key mechanism in the production of literary and anthropological crisis (Girard).4 The connection between artistic creation, scientific invention, and poetic process on the one hand and the de struction of established belief and tradition on the other is reflected upon in the works of Herder, the young Goethe, E.T.A. Hoffmann, and Heinrich von Kleist, but the use of "murder" remains either purely metaphorical or is bound up with moral, social, or political transgression. The first historical instance of a literal and amoral consideration of murder can be found in the early nineteenth century. Thomas De Quincey thematized murder as a subject of intellectual inquiry in his essay "On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts" (1827).5 He was concerned with murder as a purely aesthetic phenome non,.as a craft or technique which can be judged like any other action as to the brilliance of its execution. Finally, we are familiar with the tradition of murder in early twentieth-century literature—one thinks of Expressionist Drama (Wedekind) and Schnitzler's short prose works-yet murder in these instances is unequivocally coupled with a transgression against morality, a rebellion against bourgeois values and norms, an emancipation of instinct and impulse from the hypocrisy of "rational society." In the case of Thomas Bernhard's novel Das Kalkwerk (1970)6 this destructive tendency and its ful fillment in murder possess no emancipatory or cultural-revolutionary power and have nothing to do with the triumph of sensuality or Trieb over reason. Murder is linked to writing, and it no longer functions as a mere metaphorical trope, a symbolic gesture, a rebellious act. It is the elusive consequence of an inability to actualize discourse, to write, the apparent result of an inherent constitutive failure of literary communication and intersubjective under standing. As Bernhard Sorg pointed out in his study,7 most recent critics have taken two different approaches to the work of Bernhard, and Das Kalkwerk is no exception: first, there have been formal analyses of the narrative structure, syntax, and style of the work.8 Secondly, there have been interesting at tempts to treat Bernhard's work in general and Das Kalkwerk in particular as forms of contemporary social satire and criticism.9 In my approach to this work I shall combine an analysis of formal aspects-specifically rhetorical</page><page sequence="3">Thomas Bernhard 's Das Kalkwerk 21 devices, narrative structure and the use of citation-with considerations of the material content of the work. My aim is to show (1) how Das Kalkwerk simultaneously represents a critique and embodiment of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century models of representation, that is, how Bernhard takes up, transforms, and plays with modern literary and historical "lan guages"; (2) to specify the theory of language that informs the work in rela tion to current discourse theory; and finally (3) to indicate where Bernhardt work might be placed within the context of Postmodernism. One can define "Rhetoric" as the means of convincing a dialogical partner, a method of appropriating the views of others; the art of persuasion, of proving one's point, of a compelling argument. It always consists of spe cific rules of construction and formulation with a dialectic between two opposing positions. Contemporary theory is beginning to emphasize this dialectical aspect of rhetoric once again. In the current debate concerning Postmodernism the conception of language as Rhetoric plays a decisive role. It has been noted by diverse critics such as Lyotard, Kristeva, Benhabib and Huyssen that the key issue in this debate is the structural transformation of language-theory. The argument is that our very understanding of language has undergone a structural transformation, one that can be likened to the advent of Romantic theory of language in the late eighteenth century (Herder, Fried rich Schlegel, Wilhelm von Humboldt) and the revolution of structural lin guistics of the early twentieth century: it is claimed that we have moved beyond language as structural system and the theory of meaning (Saussure and Frege) to Pragmatics as a theory of performatives (aspects of the late Wittgenstein, Austin, Searle and, under the influence of Critical Theory, Jürgen Habermas and K.-O. Apel with their conception of Universal Prag matics).10 As Benhabib correctly points out, "rhetoric" would be a more appropriate term for the Postmodern Theory of Language as Agonistics: although Pragmatics as a theory of performatives and the new Rhetoric both take the speech-act as their point of departure, the new Rhetoric places greater emphasis on the language-game as a whole and the conflict between various discourses. Pragmatics insists on what Grice and Habermas term validity claims (Geltungsansprüche),11 -truthfulness, good intention, compre hensibility, clarity, belief-while the new Rhetoric repudiates universal validity claims and undermines the distinction between authority and power, legitimacy and rulership, right and coercion, consensus and terror. To make validity claims that set universal conditions of communicative interaction according to the new Rhetorical theory of Postmodernism is nothing other than to force people to accept a metatheory of truth, to superimpose a sys tem of belief on the participants of a language game. I shall argue that it is</page><page sequence="4">22 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE not simply a matter of which conception of language is more adequate, as Seyle Benhabib states,12 but rather whether we want to opt for a normative prescription of ideal communication or an actual description of language as a means of manipulation and coercion, as rhetoric. In the final analysis I will take the position implied by Rorty that we use the interpretive lever that is capable of getting the most out of the text, in this case the neorhetorical Agonis tics of discourse as a mechanism of appropriation, coercion, and power. Thus, instead of operating with the form/content distinction that has characterized much of the work on Bernhard and revealing the paradoxes that indeed exist between the indeterminacy of narration and the factuality and causal necessity of murder, I propose to look at the novel not in terms of its discursive unity but rather its discursive conflict and dispersion, that is, in terms of the friction between the language of the narrative, the level of char acter and action, and the narrative strategy itself. What emerges in this approach is what I refer to in the title as the underlying Rhetoric of the work, that specific dialectic of subjective positions encased in historical languages that fuel the trajectory toward murder. This dialectic simultaneously func tions as a recognizable structure of appeal (Appellstruktur) for the reader, who through the various ciphers and citations of and allusions to Hegel, Bacon, Novalis, Kropotkin, Wittgenstein, Pascal, and Freud seeks to recon struct the murder as the result of this war between discourses. I shall specific ally urge that this "Rhetoric" that informs the work consists of a violent confrontation of two discourses of modernity: nihilism, which was a direct outgrowth of German Idealism of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, and political Anarchism of the nineteenth century. Bernhard takes up and juxtaposes these two historical positions in literary form in order to explore the consequences of modern subjectivity as both creator and mur derer of forms: artistic and scientific production require anarchistic freedom from external dogma and constraint, and yet this anarchy invariably leads to a nihilism that not only destroys tradition and history but also undermines any possibility of genuine art and science. The conflict of these two historical "languages" reaches a threshold that triggers the destruction of the victim, the murder of the mimetic double. Within Das Kalkwerk this rhetoric functions on different diegetic levels. First and foremost we can identify a system of formal repetition by which the material content is first presented, restated in different, often contra dictory, ways through different reports with different emphases and through different narrative perspectives, disrupting the narrative continuum and questioning any narrative claim to truth or meaning. Typically, the discourse</page><page sequence="5">Thomas Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk 23 unit is obliterated through uncontrolled hyperbole, inversion, or internal con tradiction. I will identify four primary stylistic/rhetorical techniques opera tive in Das Kalkwerk: syntactic-semantic density, spiraling convolution, semantic vertical intensification, and an abrupt, often incoherent, breaking off of discourse. Secondly, the rhetoric functions as a system of mimetic convergence in which the subjects in conflict collide in their desire for or resistance to specific objects, texts, symbols, or ciphers. Finally, with regard to the content plane, the actual argumentation strategies of the subjects, the rhetoric of murder, is visible in the paralogism of Konrad's imposition of his totalizing ideal of natural science as a method of torture on his murder victim and Frau Konrad's counterimperatives; his discursive paralysis and her physi cal disability, juxtaposed to the unceasing rhetoric of the text; and the impo tence of his totalizing representation of the world and her poetic nihilism over and against the sudden and inexplicable "action" of murder. If we equate for a moment narration and murder, as Bernhard does in the dream sequence,-"Eine solche lückenlose Erzählung... und man vernichtet den be treffenden Menschen ..." {KW 151)—the novel becomes a self-reflection on narrative and narrative understanding as the production of an intensified indeterminacy: to tell or read the story is to become increasingly entangled in a web of incomprehensibility. As the central mode of interaction the argu ment or confrontation of "languages" underscores the futility of any herme neutics to ensure actual Verständigung, both within the structure of the novel and between the narrative and its reader. Although recent studies have criti cized the hermeneutic enterprise both as a lever for grasping Bernhard's narra tives and as an overall conception of communicative interaction,13 they have stopped short of explicitly showing how hermeneutical logic must be viewed as another misguided attempt to master history and intersubjectivity and also as a destructive comprehension of open interpretive possibilities. I shall take seriously Bernhard's programmatic claim that ".. .jedes Erkenntnisstreben ist eine Todesmethode .. ."14 - that every struggle for knowledge is a method of death and, a fortiori, that every attempt at hermeneutical understanding is a method of murder. I. After years of travel Konrad and his disabled wife buy the Limeworks as a sanctuary in which Konrad plans to write his philosophical study entitled Das Gehör, a study which he has already completed in his head. Five and a half years later their residing at the Limeworks ends abruptly in Konrad's murder of his wife. The novel takes as its point of departure this murder of Frau Konrad and, parodying the "analytic" detective novel, fails to recon</page><page sequence="6">24 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE struct the reasons for the murder. The motivation to uncover the "story," the exact causes of the murder are immediately linked to wealth and value, as the chief narrator is the insurance agent in charge of the case. The two sub narrators,-Fro and Wieser, relate in indirect discourse, sometimes to the sec ond or third degree, the circumstances that supposedly led to the murder. But no account of the "facts" will yield any truth or understanding; from the outset it is evident that there can be no final judgment regarding the murder. The physical evidence is shrouded in reportage, second-, third- and fourth hand reports and rumors concerning the couple: four different papers in four nearby towns offer paradoxical accounts of the number of shots fired, how and where Frau Konrad was shot, and what Konrad did with his wife after the murder. We are thus dealing from the very beginning with a narrative dis course that is shot through with hermeneutic lacunae, interpretive indetermi nacies, a discourse that continually deflects our attention away from the actual "facts" or "occurrence" of the murder and redirects our focus to the logic and language, the representation and teleology of murder as a form of symbolic action. In order to grasp the logic and etiology of murder that compels Konrad in his (self)-destructive tendency, one must examine the various subtexts or languages that appear in the text. Konrad despises art and anything artificial (KW 6), and he is equally vehement about anything functional or bureau cratic {KW 22). Cynically opposed to all forms of "institution," Konrad is obsessed with a conception of natural science he sees embodied in the experi mental method. This is manifest in the project he plans to write and com plete, and the scientific method utilized for his research in the study—the "Urbantschitsche Methode" named after a follower of Freud-and finally in the dogged compulsion with which he pursues scientific and philosophical conversations with Fro and Wieser, the two administrators and subnarrators who continually become entangled in Konrad's diatribe {KW 8-9). The reason given for the move into the Limeworks is precisely that such a scientific philosophical study requires total isolation and quiet. Ironically, the study is concerned with the underlying basis of communication and hearing, yet the Limeworks is sufficiently isolated that there can be no internal/external com munication. Konrad's worship of experimental research and "scientific method" is illustrated by the glorification of the small portrait of Francis Bacon. Konrad is often totally unable to distinguish himself from the por trait, suggesting that what modern critics have termed mimetic undifferentia tedness has already set in: the inability to discern between self and historical figures and images is often cited as the beginning of madness and possible ritual violence.15 In his inability to distinguish himself from the image of</page><page sequence="7">Thomas Bernhard 's Das Kalkwerk 25 Bacon, Konrad has already lost any sense of self-identity, which is paradoxi cally the condition for the writing of the study. The relation between the so-called "scientific method" that Konrad uti lizes on his wife to obtain the data for his philosophical study on hearing and Bernhardt own equation of knowledge and death, epistemology and violence, hermeneutics and murder is concretized in the indirect account of the meth od as an unrelenting form of torture (KW 72-73): to the building inspector he relates that on the basis of the "Urbantschitsche Methode" .. experi mentiere ich sie [seine Frau] zu Tode" {KW 91). Invention and creation are in the jargon of Konrad the greatest crimes that can be committed. The narra tive framework for this discourse concerning science and creativity is the idolatrous relation of Konrad to the poet-anarchist-scientist Petr Alekseevich Kropotkin (1842-1921),16 with whose scientific works Konrad terrorizes his wife by reading passages that she does not understand over and over again. Thus the "truth fanatic" Konrad (KW 13) mirrors the writings and life of the anarchist-scientist Kropotkin and tortures his wife by reading unceasingly from Kropotkin's work, A Change for the Better, not from the romantic novel of self-cultivation Heinrich von Ofterdingen by Frau Konrad's Lieb lingsdichter Novalis. There is a sub-narrative battle of different "readings" in the novel, a war of subjects and their respective "texts." A central motivation for the move into the Limeworks besides creating a proper environment for the completion of the study Das Gehör is to pro tect Frau Konrad, rendered helpless in a wheelchair by improper medical care, against "foreign elements" or intruders. Bernhard's work typically in verts the relation between the norm and the deviation in such a way that the outsider-the disabled,.the cancer patient, the murderer, the alcoholic, the insane, the tubercular patient-is the insider. The "foreign elements" or out siders have a gory history inside and outside the isolated structure of the Limeworks, and the levels of paranoia are extremely high: in one hundred years eleven murders took place within its walls, and there are two unsolved murders of local Landwirte. Konrad, originally fascinated with weapons of all kinds, particularly antiquated but accurate pistols, fits into the paranoia of the structure perfectly. Because the Limeworks is weighed down with this history of murders, Konrad teaches his wife to protect herself with the Männ licher Carbine that he uses to murder her. Her instrument of survival be comes the weapon of her own death. The material implement of protection is a tool of destruction: Konrad installs iron bars on all the windows of the Limeworks so that what was originally intended as a refuge and a sanctuary is</page><page sequence="8">26 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE transformed into an incarceration unit. The Limeworks is not simply a deadly locus, but a form of life for those who inhabit it. Konrad claims that the Limeworks itself actually killed his wife. The physical structure produces the total paranoia necessary for the antagonism manifested in language that ulti mately leads to the murder of Frau Konrad. The Limeworks is the physical embodiment and topos of the seemingly necessary teleology of murder: "Un ser Ziel ist das Kalkwerk gewesen, unser Ziel ist der Tod gewesen durch das Kalkwerk" (KW 176). Here the reader cannot help but reflect on this locus, the very title of the work, as an ironic play on the creation of the artwork (Kunstwerk): lime is the caustic highly infusible substance utilized in the mixture of mortar and plaster for building or construction purposes, yet it is extremely diffuse. The Limeworks is a physical structure on the margin of humanity, as Konrad's own "work" is always on the fragile brink of spilling out of his head onto the paper. Das Kalkwerk, the structure of murder, is the material instance of Das Kunstwerk, which Konrad identifies with the philo sophical study he cannot produce. The problematic of understanding plays a key role in the conflict be tween the murderer and the victim. The aggravation of the conflict occurs through intensified misunderstanding, misconstrual, distortion, and the fail ure of communication. The perpetual "speaking past one another" functions in the novel not simply as a device of narrative resistance but also as the sub version of any gesture to move outside of the discourses within which the players are captive, any attempt at "pure" or "undistorted" expression. Obsessed with Novalis, Frau Konrad demands that Konrad read to her from Ofterdingen although she is usually incapable of understanding entire passages (KW 107). The repetition of incomprehensible sentences enacts the mutual incomprehensibility of the double "Konrad" on a textual level. All communi cation between the two, as all communication in general, is said to be a lie (KW 38): the lie is a means of communication in order not to communicate. The crisis of language has a well-documented history in Austrian literature, most notably in Hofmannsthal: "Mein Fall ist, in Kürze, dieser: es ist mir völlig die Fähigkeit abhanden gekommen, über irgend etwas zusammenhän gend zu denken oder zu sprechen. Zuerst wurde es mir allmählich unmöglich, ein höheres oder allgemeineres Thema zu besprechen und dabei jene Worte in den Mund zu nehmen, deren sich doch alle Menschen ohne Bedenken geläufig zu bedienen pflegen.... Es zerfiel mir alles in Teile, die Teile wieder in Teile, und nichts mehr Meß sich mit einem Begriff umspannen."17 The crisis of understanding and communication in Das Kalkwerk should not be identified with the questioning of language as an able carrier of mean ing as in the "Sprachskepsis" of fin-de-siècle Vienna. In Bernhardt prose</page><page sequence="9">Thomas Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk 27 works and drama, and here in Das Kalkwerk, the characters discourse end lessly, the world has been rendered a linguistic construct throughout-we have nothing but reports, quotations, citations, disparate and desperate dis courses-and there is a conceptual clarity and lucidity to the thoughts and ex pressions, but despite the sheer volume of language there is no real inter subjective understanding. There is no "language crisis" per se, it is not the problem of a character engaging in a critical reflection on language, a dis illusionment with words, or a deep-seated skepticism concerning the relation between language and reality, word and referent: the subjects here are too enmeshed in discourse, too identical with their respective "languages" to represent "Sprachskepsis." The crisis here is one of the overdetermination of discourse and the purely rhetorical function of speech. In the mutual incom prehensibility of the conversations between Konrad and Frau Konrad and in the contradictory representations of these conversations by the two adminis trators/subnarrators Fro and Wieser Bernhard questions any underlying basis for communication or any hermeneutical method that would attempt to elaborate the "meaning" of individual speech-acts. These acts are questioned as to their purity, singularity, coherence, and their reliance on specific rules. The frequent use of the prefix "ver-" throughout the novel and particu larly in critical passages-"Verbannung," "Verzweiflung," "Vernichtung," "Verneinung," "Verdoppelung"-underscores the incessant destabilization of discourse. With the multivalent prefix that simultaneously indicates diversion, miscalculation, completion, intensification, and transformation Bernhard reiterates the oblique relation between subjects and between the narrator and subnarrators on the level of language. It is not coincidental that the only speech-acts we find in the communicative interaction between Konrad and Frau Konrad are imperatives, the speech-acts which for their success rely totally on the perlocutionary force of the utterance, that is, on the effect which the utterance produces or the "functioning" of the receiver. Konrad's disdain for mere "function" and those who function as "functionaries" stands in sharp contrast to the way in which he relates to Frau Konrad. To force her to speak Konrad torments her by reading sentences from Kropot kin, but instead of eliciting a response he only effects "... ein noch größeres Schweigen" {KW 84-85). The deadly monological discourses of Konrad can be characterized by spiraling repetitive sentences that circle and consume themselves without any apparent goal or purpose, bringing the problem of understanding and communication to an untenable pitch: "Und sage er zum Beispiel, wie ungeheuerlich der Kropotkin sei, verstehe sie ihn nicht, was ihm die Studie bedeute, verstehe sie ihn nicht. Sagt er: die Naturwissenschaft ist es allein, die Naturwissenschaft, so verstehe sie ihn nicht" (KW 145). It is</page><page sequence="10">28 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE significant that the only place any form of what one might call true commu nication occurs in the passage in which the direct discourse of Konrad is pre sented for the first time without the mediation and subversion of indirect report, when the director of the bank gives Konrad the loan he has requested (KM/ 111 ff). Communication has been reduced to monetary exchange: real communication takes place in the exchange of capital, in banks, not in con versation between people or between an author and a public. The other position in this rhetoric of anarcho-nihilistic murder, and the counterpoint to Konrad's anarchistic science, is the figure of Frau Konrad. That her romantic,.artistic illusions and digressions are nihilistic in nature is borne out by her choice of Novalis as her Lieblingsdichter, who, after the death of Sophie consciously willed himself to death. This nihilism is cast by Bernhard in a scene where she powders herself in the minor in a deadly comical spiral of masking and ultimately losing of identity. ... los, die Puderdose! und dann pudert sie ihr Gesicht ein und schaut sich in den Spiegel, abwechselnd pudert sie ihr Gesicht ein und schaut sie sich in den Spiegel. Plötzlich sagte sie: ich sehe ja nichts, ich sehe ja überhaupt nichts. Tatsächlich, so Konrad zu Wie ser, sieht sie in der Puderwolke in ihrem Spiegel nichts. Wahrschein lich ist es gut, daß ich nichts sehe, sagte sie, darauf pudert sie sich immer noch mehr ein. Ihr ganzes Kleid ist voller Puder, soll Konrad zu Wieser gesagt haben, und immer wieder sagt sie: ich muß mich einpudern, einpudern muß ich mich, zur Gänze einpudern, und wie kein Puder mehr in der Puderdose ist, sagt sie: haben wir nicht noch irgendwo Puder? Es muß doch noch Puder da sein! Puder! Puder! Puder! sagt sie und tatsächlich finde ich eine zweite Puderdose und sie pudert ihr Gesicht vollkommen ein ... sie hat sich ihr Gesicht vollkommen zugepudert. Zugepudert! Zugepudert! sagt sie: zuge pudert! Zugepudert!, ruft sie aus, sagt Konrad, plötzlich lacht sie und ruft: eingepudert, zugepudert, zugepudert, eingepudert, zuge pudert! und dann schweigt sie und richtet sich auf und sagt: gut so. Und noch einmal: gut so. Und dann: die Vorstellung ist aus: Abge brochen. Die Vorstellung ist abgebrochen, aus. (KW 184) The term "nihilism" appears for the first time in the late eighteenth century in F. H. Jacobi's Sendschreiben an Fichte (1799) as a criticism of subjective Idealism, and nihilism surfaces in Das Kalkwerk as the language of the victim.18 Frau Konrad lives in a fictive world of dreams and the past, a</page><page sequence="11">Thomas Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk 29 world that lacks meaning and action and questions the romantic conception of subjectivity and artistic creation. In the powder scene she obliterates herself in a rhetorical emphase that conceals the real disintegration of subjec tivity occurring underneath: in a caricature romantic subjectivity and artistic creativity are exposed as nihilistic acts of self-destruction. The digression allows one to identify stylistic and rhetorical techniques: 1) introduction of the material, then a spiraling intensification through expletives and inversion, a hyperbole that threatens to spin out of control; the speech then exhausts itself, having moved through its own dense syntactic-semantic permutations; finally the abrupt fragmentation or breaking-off; 2) the mimetic convergence on objects, in this case the powder and the mirror, which she has taken over for her theatrical demonstration; finally 3) the digressive invective plays on the term Vorstellung: the breaking-off of the theatrical presentation is simultaneously the rupture of subjective representation. The romantic theory of artistic production as self-representation cannot hold; it inevitably leads to loss of identity, madness, and death. The miscommunication between Konrad and Frau Konrad consists of the mutual tyrannization through commands. Frau Konrad responds to her husband's imposition of the scientific method on her with her own mad im peratives. In Das Kalkwerk language is mutual tyranny, institutionalized and legitimized torture, conventional destruction and murder. The myth rampant in bourgeois society of mutual recognition, reciprocal communication, and empathetic understanding is torn apart in a rhetorical play on the master servant dialectic in Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind. In the multiple allusions to Hegel Das Kalkwerk reveals just how vicious dialectical thinking can be. Applied to the bourgeois institution of marriage, this dialectic appears in the following way: "... in eine Ehe gehen heiße wie in eine Freundschaft gehen, den Zustand doppelter Verzweiflung ganz bewußt auf sich nehmen, aus der Vorhölle des Alleinseins in die Hölle des Zusammenseins gehen. Und ganz zu schweigen von ihrer beider Zusammensein. Denn die doppelte Verzweiflung und doppelte Verbannung zweier intelligenter Menschen, zweier, die sich alles durch den Verstand letzten Endes doch ... vollkommen klar bewußt machen können, sei eine doppelte doppelte Verzweiflung und eine doppelte doppelte Verbannung" {KW 145). In another passage the Hegelian doctrine of recipro cal recognition, central to dialectical thinking down to the present day, is turned upside down: reciprocal recognition becomes a battle of reciprocal destruction. Whereas Hegel's dialectic of master and servant resolves itself in the labor of the servant, Bernhardt satire on this dialectic ends with the murder of the slave-victim and the self-destruction of the master. This can also be seen as a play on Hegel's dialectic of "Die absolute Freiheit und der</page><page sequence="12">30 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE Schrecken" in Chapter VI of the Phenomenology, where self-consciousness before the ascent into morality (&lt;Sittlichkeit) is turned back on itself to the degree that the meaninglessness of death and terror are the only real objects it can still entertain. One must consider finally the irony of Konrad's philo sophical-scientific study Das Gehör and the physical structure of the Lime works that makes it impossible for anybody to hear or understand anything: in total réclusion the dialectic plays itself out in the telos of Hegel's "struggle to the death." Rhetoric in the traditional sense first described by Aristotle (Rhetoric 1354a) and transmitted in the European tradition into the eighteenth century was an important aspect of dialectics, the science of probability and dialogics in opposition to analytics, the science of apodictic certainty. One of its primary functions was to instruct in the art of speaking by teaching correct construction, formulation, and delivery of an argument: its proving ground was the Disputation, the dialectic of positions through which one could attain a higher level of truth.19 Today Rhetoric encompasses not only the traditional applications but also the structure of discourse (Barthes), the in tentionality of rhetorical figures (De Man), and the hidden power of commu nication (Habermas). One attempt to define the relation between rhetoric and hermeneutics was made by H. G. Gadamer in his essay "Rhetorik, Hermeneu tik und Ideologiekritik."20 In Gadamer's view hermeneutics can lay bare the rhetorical power of discourse and reveal the efficacy of unexamined cate gories in our languages, and rhetoric requires understanding to achieve effec tive communication. Gadamer's reconciliation of the two disciplines runs as follows: "So durchdringen sich der rhetorische und der hermeneutische Aspekt der menschlichen Sprachlichkeit auf vollkommene Weise. Es gäbe keinen Redner und keine Redekunst, wenn nicht Verständigung und Ein verständnis die menschlichen Beziehungen trüge .. ,"21 In Das Kalkwerk Bernhard renders this relation extremely problemati cal by articulating the disjunction between rhetoric and language as a mecha nism of power and appropriation-and understanding: understanding does not serve as a necessary presupposition of discursive interaction, and indeed Das Kalkwerk suggests that the power of discourse and the conflict of dis cursive positions gain their impetus precisely from the failure, the breakdown of communication and understanding. There can be no doubt that for Bern hard rhetoric as the science of dialectics and as the primary function of communication is itself implicated in a destructive and terrifying process: to create a written discourse in the Limeworks proves to be impossible-we think of Konrad's inability to formulate the study in his head. Yet the central</page><page sequence="13">Thomas Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk 31 figures and narrators discourse in their prescribed languages and narrative roles without any mutual understanding, and without any knowledge of the "reasons" for the murder. II. In a recent important theoretical work Jean-François Lyotard has de scribed the present crisis of scientific thinking, evident in the most diverse scholarly disciplines, as a crisis of metanarratives.22 The two central meta narratives discussed by Lyotard in this connection as the framing conditions for modern scientific discourse are speculative idealism and empirical prag matics. The current penchant for catastrophe-theory, incommensurability, indeterminacy, and local rationality questions the authority of these two underlying structures of scientific-scholarly thought dominant since the late eighteenth century. It is not specious to interpret Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk as an attempt to draw these two massive metanarrative schemes to their logical conclusion: romantic nihilism, which destroys this world in favor of a poetic vision, was born in the heart of German Idealism and is its direct spin-off. The idolatry of scientific method, the cipher of Kropotkin, and the image of Bacon place Konrad in the service of an ideology of empirical science that is at once absolute,.totalizing, and paralyzing; 23 his self-characterization as a "scientific philosopher" situates him at the very boundary of Lyotard's cate gories. As the anarchist-scientist-philosopher Konrad is on the boundary be tween modern and postmodern science: "Dazu müsse man auch Mathemati ker und Physiker und also ein vollkommener Naturwissenschaftler und dazu auch noch Prophet und Künstler sein und das alles in höchstem Maße" (KW 64). But while he is beyond the constraints of the one-sided theory and estab lished disciplinary boundaries, he still believes in the efficacy of traditional scientific method (KW 154). The inevitable confrontation between the rhetoric I have discussed, a rhetoric incapable of self-realization in the world as either true art or science, and the realm of concrete action can produce only violence. Konrad's anar chistic method prevents his ever knowing there is no "pregnant moment" to write the study on Das Gehör: "... kurz vor dem Unglück ... soll Konrad zu Fro gesagt haben, sei er sich der Tatsache bewußt, daß es überhaupt keinen idealen, geschweige denn idealsten Augenblick, die Studie niederschreiben zu können, gebe ..." (KW 210). The entirely reflective-poetic existence of Frau Konrad as nihilism is equally impotent.24 According to Lyotard's analysis of the post-modern condition, science, which still retains the nostalgia for totality, consistency, and homology and fails to grasp the inherent indetermi nacy, incommensurability, and locality in the Postmodern era is condemned</page><page sequence="14">32 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE to reproduce terror: 'The nineteenth and twentieth centuries have given us as much terror as we can take. We have paid a high price for the nostalgia of the whole and the one, for the reconciliation of the concept and the sensible, of the transparent and the communicable experience."25 In the Limeworks Konrad's obsession with an absolutistic conception of scientific method and his inability to actualize thought take the form of a misdirected murder, a murder that Konrad himself describes as the destruc tion of his own life and of the incomplete study. This reciprocal murder is structurally mimetic: not only does the anarchist-scientist kill off his opposite and double, the romantic-nihilist, but the man kills off his female counter part, his half-sister in an incestuous misrelation. The rhetoric of anarcho nihilistic murder indicates a necessary teleology inherent within two determi nant models of scientific thought. The only viable alternative that exists, one that is not perceived by Konrad, is to write : this fearlessness to write and realize the study—"... Furchtlosigkeit vor Realisierung, vor Verwirkli chung ..(KW 211)-escapes Konrad, and his scientific method is trans formed into a method of murder. Violence occurs at the moment Konrad sees that there is no ideal moment for writing the study (KW 210). Writing functions conversely in order to prevent violence and murder as the "buffer zone" or prophylactic between thought and action, between the thoughts of the study that Konrad has "ready made" in his head and physical violence. According to the theory of Post-Modernity advanced by Lyotard, literature and science have both presupposed a stifling system for too long. The crisis of meta-narratives discussed by Lyotard simultaneously represents a critique of systems theory and systematic thinking in general.26 Bernhard's novel Das Kalkwerk reveals the conflict of absolutistic system-thinking of modernity, as one bent on (self-) destruction. Konrad's failure to actualize the study stems from the fact that, every time he begins to work on it, he gets lost in preliminary research (Vorarbeiten) or that, while he is pacing the floor thinking about the study, he counts the steps instead of properly focusing on the realization of the book: "Anstatt daß ich aber während des Aufundab gehens an die Studie denke, soll er zu Wieser gesagt haben, zähle ich die Schritte und werde dadurch halb verrückt" (KW 5). There is the inherent problem of absolute, totalizing system-theory: the very energy expended in order to ascertain a level of maximum performance and optimal functioning depletes precisely those resources that could create an optimal state of affairs. As Lyotard argues, a complete comprehensive definition of a system wastes too much of the system's energy and destroys its equilibrium.27 Bernhard's central protagonist cannot realize his study for the very reason that he is attempting to create an all-encompassing system and he</page><page sequence="15">Thomas Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk 33 constantly loses himself and the study in details and obsessive definition. Every step toward a realization of the book becomes a move away from it. Lyotard's question regarding equilibrium theory could not have found a more precise literary formulation. Because the scientific study becomes an artwork only when it is written down-"... erst mit der Niederschrift wird sie [die wissenschaftliche Studie] zum Kunstwerk" {KW 65)-we are confronted with the impossibility of writing, the inability of the artwork to realize itself, literature that is already dead in its nascent state in the head.28 The Lime works does not so much function as a metaphor for the impossible process of writing as it is the space of Bemhard's writing itself: the physical structure, the material existence of the Limeworks is a historically condemned and moribund text repeating itself endlessly, distorting already existent carica tures to the point where humor and anguish intersect. III. From his earliest prose works Bernhard has been grappling with the problem of the relationship between science and violence, literature and murder, writing and death.29 For Bernhard the linguistic and societal "sys tem" from which works of art and science emerge cannot be adequately re flected, represented, or defined. Lyotard claims to be able to show how the Postmodern "work" is characterized by its continual refraction, deflection, and displacement of its linguistic mechanisms, unable, as it were, to attain any overriding totality. Systems-theory of any kind that seeks a global or all encompassing logic is doomed to produce violence and terror, but Post modernism offers local rationality, the incommensurability of language games, and the dismantling of disciplinary boundaries. If we take as two central components of the Modernist program (1) the absolutization of language or hermetic Versprachlichung and (2) the emergence of historical subjectivity as an emancipatory force in culture, Das Kalkwerk drives this elevation of language and subjective history to the threshold of paralysis, revealing the latent violence lurking beneath. In the Postmodern condition all of reality has been aestheticized and textualized. Das Kalkwerk tears way at this neoaestheticistic escape from the real paralogies of systems theory, exposing the illusion of theories that reify and celebrate the conflict of in commensurable language games. Bernhard reflects upon the central category of mimesis in both its classical and romantic forms as verisimilar representation of the world or the expressive creation of subjectivity reduced to the tormenting destructive mechanisms of discourse itself. Yet the rhetoric of anarcho-nihilistic murder</page><page sequence="16">34 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE is still simply that: one rhetoric among many, a vicious dialectic that plays itself out in gruesome acts of real violence. It would be absurd for us to iden tify this rhetoric of murder with the intention of the work. Bernhard's critical execution of the historical discourses of speculative idealism, romantic nihi lism on the one hand and empirical pragmatics and anarchistic science on the other serves as a warning; it does not allow for any absolute method of human science or for any theory of knowledge or performatives that would empower us, in the words of René Girard, .. to expose to the light of rea son the role played by violence in human society."30 From our reading of Das Kalkwerk, it is simply another myth of Enlightenment to hypothesize a comprehensive theory of violence, for, as Bernhard suggests, it is compre hensive theory itself, totalizing scientific desire, universalisée conceptions, in a word knowledge itself, regardless of the form it takes-be it empirico phenomenological or Girard's own "hypothetical knowledge"-that is the basis for our unrelenting murder of the subject, our doubles, ourselves. Ac cording to Bernhard's critique there can be no "scientific threshold," as Girard argues, no "... power to demystify persecution."31 In opposition to Girard's reductive and essentially Enlightenment position that posits a progressive universal explanation of violence and victimization, and equally critical of attempts at a Universal Pragmatics, Das Kalkwerk suggests that we question the multiple ways in which conflictual mimesis and violence are produced through language, how various historical discourses actually create murderers and victims. In Bernhard's recent work the cognitive anarchy32 that Girard views as a nihilism playing the role of religious faith in our time becomes a literary and scientific strategy to move between the various rhetorics of terror and control in order to dodge the multiple mechanisms of violence. As Bernhard's Das Kalkwerk articulates, there can be no radical démystification of mimesis: the rhetoric of anarcho nihilistic murder gives us a good example of how characters in narrative form play out the scripts of apparently innocent historical discourses transformed into dangerous totalizing ideologies.33 The crisis of meta-narratives discussed by Lyotard runs parallel to a crisis of narrative discourse in Bernhard, but Bernhard does not seek the comfort of paralogy and incommensurability, of mere rhetoric and of conflictual language games. The particular postmodern ity of Bernhard's novel resides precisely in its dissection of the power of regional teleologies, its recognition of the rhetorical function of all mis communication, and its acerbic criticism of absolutistic universal systems or rationalities of any kind, particularly those which become the material basis for mimetic acts of violence and murder.
