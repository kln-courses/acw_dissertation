<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDREAS BERTOLDI Oedipus in (South) Africa?: Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference I. Introduction In South Africa today the medical and psychological professions are being called to account for their conduct under apartheid. At stake is their failure to counter racism and its institutional manifestations, or worse, their active collusion with the government apparatus of the period. Already in 1985, Dawes, in a paper entitled "Politics and Mental Health: The Position of Clinical Psychology in South Africa," has suggested that mental ill-health (primarily in black patients) should be understood as a consequence of apartheid which he sees as "psychopathogenic," and which clinicians had failed to address (1985, 15). In his 1986 keynote address to the annual congress of the Psychological Association of South Africa, Simon Biesheuvel countered Dawes' assertions, and thus sets the stage for the rest of this paper. Biesheuvel's response was that Dawes had overlooked the "importance of power in group relations, the humiliation of being totally dominated by a white minority and the identity problems created thereby" (1987,4). Furthermore Biesheuvel, although professing his opposition to it, argued that apartheid should not be immediately removed or opposed because, "as a statutory system it.. . [was] . .. only a proximate cause" of the crisis (4). Rather underlying the crisis was group prejudice and conflict—a conflict that was both primordial and universal, and must "be sought deep down in the nature of man" (4).

What role then for psychology? According to Biesheuvel, We need to search for value-free and culture-free univer sal, as well as recognize the need for culture-specific constructs. Politically motivated action research is ac ceptable, provided it does not bias empirical research procedures in declaring certain topics taboo, e.g., ge netic explanations. Our society needs research into values, aggression, and violence but psychology can be more immediately useful by concentrating on short term studies of cross-cultural attitude measurement, conflict management, media censorship, leadership de velopment, and early-learning programmes for environ mentally disadvantaged children. (1987,1) The sub-text of this statement is, I hope, rather transpar ent! Biesheuvel's remarks set the stage for the development of my arguments in this paper, which seek to interrogate some of the issues surrounding psychoanalysis specifically (rather than psychology) in South African history. As such it will not be exhaustive of this relatively under-researched area, but rather the presentation of a range of problems and tensions around psychoanalysis and the politics of difference. These issues are already reflected in Biesheuvel's statements: the presupposi tion of groups (tribes, races etc.), the latent and sometimes explicit racism of psychological approaches, the ideas of cul ture or group conflict, deculturation and acculturation theory, and the vexed issues of universalism in psychoanalysis—issues present, I suggest, since the very first ventures into psycho analysis in South Africa in the 1920s. The history of psychology and psychoanalysis in Southern Africa specifically, and Africa more generally, is a rather</page><page sequence="3">Andreas Bertoldi 103 dubious affair. That there was collusion between psychiatry and the colonial apparatus is impossible to deny. The outlines of this have already been presented in texts such as Megan Vaughan's Curing Their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness (1991), and the recently published Colonial Psychiatry and The African Mind' (1995), by Jock McCulloch, which provides a comprehensive overview of the history and writings of ethnopsychiatry and its imbrication in the colonial enterprise. These ethnopsychiatric writings were predominantly clinical in nature, and although they did draw on both psychoanalysis and ethnology, were mostly based on medical discourse. To a certain extent psychoanalysis has escaped critical scrutiny due to its relatively marginal position on the African continent more generally, and South Africa specifically. How ever in most critical investigations into the role and function of psychology under colonialism and apartheid, psychoanalysis has to a large measure simply been included within that category— an inclusion that I wish to challenge and problematise. Central to ethnopsychiatry was the shift from an older racism concerned with the "native's body" to a racism con cerned with the "native's brain." McCulloch (1995) suggests that ethnopsychiatry "shifted over time from physical to cul tural modes of explanation," but that these modes were often mixed and usually contained "some notion of the imperfectability of Africans" (5). The history of social anthro pology and ethnopsychiatry cannot easily be disentangled from theories about race and human diversity—and in particu lar suggests McCulloch, the "science of eugenics." Biesheuvel who was to be central in the "scientific approach" to psychiatry under apartheid, expresses the racial underpinnings clearly: Of all the conflicts between groups, that between races is probably the most stubborn. In addition to such eco nomic and political causes as the exploitation of cheap labour, threats to standards of living or to the political control of a dominant minority, all of which are com mon to group conflicts of many kinds, there is another factor underlying race antagonism, namely the undeni able, overt and unalterable fact of biological difference.</page><page sequence="4">104 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference [ . . . ] The individual can shed faith, nationality or class; but he cannot shed his race. [ . . . ] Recognising the existence of a conflict of interest between the two races, apartheid sets out to reduce the sources of friction and frustration by providing opportunities for separate de velopment. (1959, 2-3; italics in original) However, of immediate concern here is the position of psychoanalysis within this complex. The question arises as to the role and production of psychoanalysis (for our present concern restricted to primarily Freudian perspectives) in the colonial South African space. McCulloch in his book argues that it is important to differentiate between two distinct medical philosophies in the colony: neuropsychiatry con cerned with "brain dysfunction" and psychoanalysis concerned with "a dysfunction of a psychic nature" (1995, 9). Most recent books and articles (including McCulloch's) on colonial psychology have in fact focused attention on the role of (neuro) psychiatry and its institutions in the colonies. Specifically, this approach has been one concerned with a sociology of power and psychiatry in the service of colonial rule and all that accompanies this—notably public health systems. Neuropsychiatry in general sought the underlying organic causes of mental illness and thus easily accommodated itself to eugenicist, social Darwinist, and, by implication, racial accounts of society. Its focus was on the study of the brain, through EEG, intelligence and aptitude tests—often seeking linkages been the purported smaller brain size, lack of intelli gence and an aptitude for manual labour of the "native mind"! The role of psychoanalysis is however more complex and ambiguous. As McCulloch points out there were very few trained psychoanalysts in Africa in the 1920s and 1930s, and most were concentrated in South Africa and Algeria. (The South African Psycho-Analytical Society was only founded in May 1949 by Wulf Sachs.) Indeed, most neuropsychiatrists and psychological practitioners were in fact physicians. Yet psychoanalytic theory in particular has often been on the receiving end of virulent opposition, especially from within post-colonial criticism, even though is was not as implicated in</page><page sequence="5">Andreas Bertoldi 105 the colonial project as ethnopsychiatry. It is these criticisms of psychoanalysis in post-colonialism that I wish to present next. II. Post-Colonial Criticisms of Psychoanalytic Theory Specifically post-colonial interrogations have been scath ing in their criticism of the role or silence of psychoanalysis under colonialism and its theoretical presuppositions. This critical strain can be traced back to Franz Fanon, himself a psychoanalyst, and his famous objection in Black Skin, White Masks (1967) that in Africa, 'The Oedipus complex is far from coming into being among the Negroes" (1967, 151-152). This is read as a criticism of the perceived Euro/ethno-centrism of psychoanalysis and its claim to universal applicability. In its most favorable currents these criticisms add up to the sugges tion that psychoanalysis is culture and time bound, while in its more extreme versions amounts to the suggestion that psycho analysis is fundamentally racist. Fanon himself, it is interesting to note, is far from clear on the subject, especially as his procedure is in large part dependent upon a psychoanalytic approach. Fanon himself writes that, "only a psychoanalytic interpretation of the black problem can lay bare the anomalies of affect that are responsible for the structure of the complex" (1967, 10). In addition, his statement "that the Oedipus com plex is far from coming into being among Negroes" and the ensuing argument may suggest a necessary limitation to psy choanalysis and its capacity to understand the socio-politics of colonialism, rather than an outright dismissal of Oedipus. For Fanon the "neuroses" of the black man in colonial Algeria are not Freud's sexual neuroses (a repetition of this argument will be seen to be present in the work of the South African psychoanalyst Wulf Sachs as well). Fanon may have had reser vations about the presence of Oedipus in Algeria, but this does not commit him to a politics of difference—for Fanon libera tion is universalist and humanist in its outlook. In summary I would argue that Fanon's invocation of cultural relativity and ethnocentrism are primarily aimed at introducing the central</page><page sequence="6">106 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference ity of "socio-historical co-ordinates" (Bulhan 1980, 254), co ordinates overlooked in narrow psychological approaches. Nevertheless Fanon 's statement has become the founda tion of common claims made in post-colonial criticism, that the idea of an "African Oedipus" is nothing but a "European Phantasy" (Hitchcott 1993, 62). A recent article presents what has become the dominant opinion about the work of Fanon: Fanon's effort to call into question the universality of the Oedipus complex may constitute what is most revolu tionary about his theoretical work, a political interven tion into classical psychoanalysis of enormous import for later theorists of race and sexuality. Responding to an allusion by Lacan to the "abundance" of the Oedipus complex, Fanon shows instead the limitations of Oedi pus, or rather the ideological role Oedipus plays as a limit in the enculturating sweep of colonial expansion ism. Prone to see Oedipus everywhere they look, West ern ethnologists are impelled to find their own psycho sexual pathologies duplicated in their objects of study. Under colonialism, Oedipus is nothing if not self-repro ducing. (Fuss 1994, 33) This hostile reception of psychoanalysis in post-colonial criticism rests on two problematic assumptions. Firstly that Oedipus is a (racist) European invention and imposition, and secondly (which ties in with Oedipus) that psychoanalysis' claim to universalism is nothing but a ruse for (psychic) colonization. Another recent review article states the post colonial opposition to psychoanalysis in the strongest terms: None of the structuring mechanisms of Freud's Euro pean Oedipus have been found to exist on the African continent. [ . . . ] "Oedipus is always colonization pursued by other means." [ . . . ] Although the Oedipal triangle is a highly seductive formula, we must resist the temptation to contain that which is outside our empiri cal knowledge. We have a responsibility, as critics, to recognize our own humility, to resist the trap of univer salism and to décolonisé ourselves. (Hitchcott 1993, 65)</page><page sequence="7">Andreas Bertoldi 107 To sum up, the reasons for the opposition to psychoanaly sis in Africa is that it is: Euro-centric, totalitarian, universalist, does not apply/work in Africa, and finally operates in the service of colonial power. Although it will be admitted that in the colonial situation psychoanalysis does confront its own limits as an explanatory model, the post-colonial strategy of "difference" contains a number of pitfalls. What will emerge in this presentation is that far from there being a clear dividing line of opposition between positions of difference and posi tions of universalism, the two "strategies" will be revealed as complexly interrelated and neither one a priori "politically progressive" as is often suggested. There can be few better summaries of the post-colonial position on "difference" than that from some of the original "post-colonial studies" progenitors. Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin write in their introduction to The Post-Colonial Studies Reader (1995): The concept of universalism is one of particular interest to post-colonial writers because it is this notion of a unitary and homogeneous human nature which marginalises and excludes the distinctive characteristics, the difference, of post-colonial societies. [ . . . ] The myth of universality is thus a primary strategy of imperial control as it is manifested in literary study. [ . . . ] The assumption of universalism is a fundamental feature of the construction of colonial power because the "univer sal" features of humanity are the characteristics of those who occupy positions of political dominance. (55) Although not "innocent" or free of contamination by the colonial situation, I wish to argue for the more radical status of psychoanalysis, to defend a form of universalism, and to present some of the problematic implications of such post colonial positions on "difference." Such strategies most often arise from a conflation of a sociology of psychiatric practices in colonial institutions and the theory of psychoanalysis—i.e. psychoanalytic theory and its components are dismissed as a consequence of its perceived institutional practice (this criti</page><page sequence="8">108 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference cism most often proceeds via an application of Foucault; see Vaughan 1991, 8-12, for a discussion of some of the issues). Unlike (ethno) psychiatry, psychoanalysis in South Africa has never had any strong institutional support or involvement, but psychoanalysts in their individual capacities as medical officers (physicians) often worked in state hospitals, etc. Never theless I hope to show that psychoanalytic positions under colonialism and apartheid cannot simply be reduced to the attributions of post-colonial criticisms. Instead what emerges is a complex attempt by psychoanalysis to deal with a "psychopathogenic" social order—a social order whose foun dations could only be challenged on the basis of universalist arguments. III. Cultural Anthropology and Segregation in South Africa The radical positions of psychoanalysis can only really be understood by way of contrast to the positions taken up by the ethnopsychiatrists, and in relation to the dominant anthropo logical ideas in early twentieth century South Africa. Saul Dubow has argued that it is almost impossible to understand the emergence of segregationist discourse and later apartheid policies outside of the context of the emer gence of cultural anthropology in the early years of this century. This is however not to posit cultural anthropology as the cause or the prime mover behind the scenes. Rather, as Dubow argues, cultural anthropology provided a unique op portunity to unify two competing strands of anthropological theory current at the time, and this wittingly or unwittingly provided apartheid with its "philosophy." Dubow (1984) identifies the two strands of political an thropological thought as follows. Firstly, a liberal humanist tradition that derives its ideas from nineteenth-century notions of evolutionary-progress, "frequenüy identified . . . with Cecil Rhodes' dictum 'equal rights for all civilized men south of the Zambesi,' implicit in which was an assumption of universal humanity—even if its different constituent groups lay at vary ing stages along a single continuum" (14). The second strand</page><page sequence="9">Andreas Bertoldi 109 of "scientific racists" and eugenicists (biological determinists) also operated within an evolutionist framework and "saw humanity as lying on a continuum defined by the extremities of 'barbarity' and 'civilisation' . . . [where] the concept of 'race' rendered the relative position of races along the con tinuum, immutable" (14). The 1920s and 1930s in South Africa saw a gradual shift in anthropological thought towards a notion of "cultural adaptionism," which led to ideas such as "separate develop ment along one's own lines" (Dubow 1984,14)—a new relativ ist cultural anthropology. In the South African context this was most clearly reflected by the shift in language towards the term "culture" where previously "races" would have been preferred. As Dubow comments, "the attractiveness of 'culture' as an ideological concept resides in its presentation as an alternative to racial assimilation on the one hand and to racial oppression on the other" (1984, 16). This new anthropological sense of culture however was easily linked to a segregationist discourse, and furthermore did so by incorporating the evolutionist assumptions of both liberal assimilationists and of racist "repressionists" (Dubow 1984, 16). As a consequence, "cul ture" acquired a number of meanings: 1. as synonym for civilization, where it is associated with progress along the barbarism/civilization continuum; 2. as discrete, distinct and unique entities—the biologi cally defined human "races;" 3. cultures as "different"—this view was opposed to assimi lation, but had a place for gradual upliftment. The third view of culture was in many ways the middle path between Victorian evolutionism and scientific racism, and coincided with the segregationist model and "adaptionist view" argued by the government ethnologist G.P. Lestrade for ex ample (Dubow 1984, 17, 18). The aim of the segregationists was to retain the "tradi tional "/"tribal" structures and "chiefdoms" through territorial segregation. The hope for the new policy, as expressed by Jan Smuts, was "to foster an indigenous native culture or system of cultures, and to cease to force the Africans into alien Euro pean moulds" (Quoted in Dubow 1984, 20).</page><page sequence="10">110 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference In the Southern African context a great deal of focus has been on what has become known as "culture-conflict" and its theory. These views not only confined themselves to cultural anthropology or racially based government policies, but were pervasive throughout the society. The extent to which these ideas have fostered a "group mentality" still remains to be unraveled. But as the earlier quotations from Biesheuvel, in the late 1980s, show, this mode of thinking has remained present. In the South African case the emergence of "culture conflict" theory (also known as deculturation or acculturation theory) coincides with the general emergence of apartheid and its obsession with classification and ethnic/tribal groups. Perhaps the most explicit statement of this theory has come from Bronislaw Malinowski, in his The Dynamics of Culture Change: An Inquiry into Race Relations in Africa (1945). Defined by Malinowski as a rapid process of change affecting all aspects of a society—social, spiritual, material, systems of knowledges etc.—"culture change" was seen as a "permanent factor of human civilization," either arising spontaneously ("indepen dent evolution") or alternatively arising from the "contact of different cultures" (Malinowski 1945, 1). Furthermore, for Malinowski this defined the role and function of anthropology and perhaps psychology—as a support to the principles of indirect rule and "native administration." As Dubow has argued, in the South African case these ideas did not play a direct role in segregationist policy, but rather anthropological thought supplied a philosophy for it. As he argues, the promulgation of the 1927 Native Administration Act, essentially designed to conserve non-capitalist modes of production, did not result from any direct involvement of anthropologists, but "the new legitimacy conferred by the state on 'tribal' structures was predicated on anthropologists' de fence of the intrinsic value of 'Bantu culture,' customary law, and traditional social institutions" (1984, 23-24). There is a vast and important literature concerned with the historical transfor mations of Southern Africa in the period before (and after) World War II. In particular the radical historians of the 1970's, such as Martin Legassick and Harold Wölpe have concerned themselves with this transition from "segregation to apartheid,"</page><page sequence="11">Andreas Bertoldi 111 the creation of the rural reserves of cheap-labour, the disposses sion of land, and the destruction of the African rural economy. This work has become known as the "internal-Colonialism" thesis, and provides an important justification for calling South Africa in the period after World War I until the present, a "colonial society of a special type" (Wölpe 1972 and 1975). It is in this context that I wish to situate the South African psychoanalytic interventions, and also to situate my own (mini mal) defense of their position on universality. The history of early psychoanalysis, although not institutionalized, cannot be entirely separated from that of ethnopsychiatry and the cul tural anthropological discourse of the day. As Dubow writes, The imperative to "understand the native mind" in order to "solve the native question," itself prefigured segregationist solutions. Drawing deeply on the liberal paternalist ethic of "sympathetic administration of the natives," the "need to understand the native mind" held the undeniable implication that the native mind was somehow of a distinct type. Its recognition as a unique entity therefore entailed the devising of racially-based governmental policies. (1984, 26) IV. Psychoanalysis in South Africa As early as 1926 (Freud was still to write his Civilization and Its Discontents (1930) and Moses and Monotheism (1939 [1934 38]), Livie-Noble and Stohr put forward an early justification of the value of psychoanalysis for anthropology and govern ment in South Africa. They argued as follows: Just as the human embryo traces, to a very large extent, the physical history of the race, so it appears that the analysis of the developing mind of a child reveals much in common with the primitive minds of underdeveloped peoples. The selection of associated matter, in which to clothe imagination and phantasy, the personification of</page><page sequence="12">112 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference objects of interest, affection or fear, the anthropomorphic traits of ideation, the intense ego-consciousness develop ing spasmodically with accompanying fits of alternating emotions—all these serve to throw light upon the very structure, as well as the processes, of the primitive mind. Further close similarity is noticed between the folklore of the Bantu and the stories which children love to "make up" and tell in the privacy of the nursery, while stories to explain childbirth are practically identical. [ . . . ] The academic value of this field of research for the ethnologist can hardly be over-estimated. (1926, 1002) And further, In conclusion, it may be said that a sound knowledge of psychanalysis (sic.)—by engendering autognosis and in stilling a sense of real sympathy with the unconscious motives of wrong-doers—should be considered a prereq uisite for magistrates, teachers, ministers, and all such as have in their hands the mental health and virility of the race; and that, while greater encouragement should be given to those who are using analysis for the cure of the afflicted, the prophylactic value of the subject should be recognised and wisely employed in the training of teach ers, ministers and legal practitioners. (1926, 1005) Clearly revealed here is the desire to apply psychoanalysis to the study of the "native mind" with a view to practical solutions to the "native problem." Also evident is the equation of Africans with primitives, and through a particular appro priation of Freud, of primitives with children—remaining firmly within the thought boundaries of evolutionism. Besides this early engagement with psychoanalysis only two other major figures stand out in this period. The first, B. J. F. Laubscher, was interested in Freudian psychoanalysis, even though a physician in charge of the "native wards" at the Queenstown [Eastern Cape] asylum. However despite Laubscher's claimed psychoanalytic perspective, Freud would never have endorsed his research conclusions. In his major</page><page sequence="13">Andreas Bertoldi 113 publication, Sex, Custom and Psychopathology (1937), Laubscher concludes that the African's sexuality has a "compulsive qual ity," and that "normal sexuality in the African" was equatable with "sexual pathology in the European" (McCulloch 1995, 85). This merely lent support to "Black Peril" scares and played into the hands of segregationists. However to some extent McCulloch's portrayal of Laubscher overlooks some of the other interesting and far more ambiguous aspects of his work. In his introduction to the 1937 book for instance, Laubscher writes the following: It will be seen that the cultural pattern to which the native belongs, determines the nature of his mental content, but does not affect the particular form of mental disorder, namely, its structure, to the extent of making it something different from that which occurs in European culture, (xi) Laubscher's argument is that although the contents of the mental disorder of the African are determined by the cultural environment, its specific form or structure is in fact no different from that of the European. In Freudian terms we need to note that this suggests that by implication the mind of the African and the European in its normal condition is therefore equally the same. Although Laubscher does not escape all the assumptions about discrete "other" cultures and the difference of races, he makes an important concession to universalism—at least a universalism of fundamental psychic structure. But in the final analysis, as McCulloch writes: Sex, Custom and Psychopathology epitomized the dilemma faced by white settlers in colonial Africa: they needed blacks close by to provide labour and the comforts of domestic service, and yet they greaüy feared them. Laubscher's response to that dilemma was to depict the African as a person whose sexuality was at once both normal and aberrant. In the context of the sexual politics of Southern Africa, for him to have reached any other conclusion would have been remarkable. (1995, 86)</page><page sequence="14">114 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference However there was a psychoanalyst at the same time who did come to a different conclusion—Wulf Sachs. Much atten tion has been focused on this trained analyst since the repub lication in 1995 of his 1937 book, Black Hamlet. Although Sachs was an analyst, he worked in South African mental hospitals. He was also politically committed and strongly opposed to the racism of the period (the 1930s saw the increasing consolida tion of segregationist legislation that would culminate in apartheid in 1948). Sachs' 1933 study of mental illness came to a remarkable conclusion for that time. In it he suggested that the mind of the "native" in its abnormal state was identical to that of the European, and thus "the working principles of the mind in the normal state must also be identical in both cases" (713). Further he wrote in this paper, I realise that to people who still cherish a privileged position in the universe, my statement will sound exagger ated and based on false deductions from the abnormal to the normal. Whoever is acquainted with the essence of the psychotic symptom and with its similarity to other unconscious manifestations of the normal people, will not be deterred from such conclusions. (713) Sachs is here not only referring to possible skepticism addressed to the psychoanalytic method, but more centrally the skepticism that would accompany any attempt to equalize the "races." In the same year that Laubscher published his Sex, Custom and Psychopathology, Wulf Sachs published Black Hamlet: The Mind of an African Negro Revealed by Psychoanalysis (1937). This book was written between 1933 and 1936, following Sachs' "analysis" through free association of John Chavafambira ("Black Hamlet"), whom Sachs had met in a Johannesburg slum yard known as "Rooiyard." The book—whose genre is difficult to define, being part case history, part narrative, part projection, part anthropological research—concerns Sachs' account of the life story of this Manyika (present day eastern Zimbabwe) nganga (healer-diviner) who moves from Rhodesia (now Zim</page><page sequence="15">Andreas Bertoldi 115 babwe) to Johannesburg in the early 1920s. Dubow (1993) has argued that, "as an attempt to understand the complex pathol ogy of South African race relations, Black Hamlet is greatly in advance of its time. However, it remains a document of time. That too is part of its fascination" (520). For Dubow, Sachs' text remains above all a text of its time, and must as such be understood within the context of the anthropological and racial discourse, especially the culture contact theory, preva lent at the time (see Dubow 1984). This was also a period that saw the increasing legislation of racial segregation, rapid industrialization and urbanization, as well as the emergence of organized African resistance (Dubow 1993, 520-522). Thus Sachs' interventions need to be understood in a context, where for "the mzyority of white South Africans, then as today, black South Africa was scarcely understood outside of the master-servant relations which governed daily interaction" (Dubow 1993, 523). It is against this background that the radicalness of Sachs' proposals needs to be seen. The major analytical device that Sachs resorts to in the interpretation of John's life is that of "Hamletism." According to Sachs (1937), John was suffering from Hamletism, "a universal phenomenon symbolising indecision and hesitancy when action is required and reasonably expected" (176). Following Freud and Ernest Jones (1949), Sachs suggests that this phenomenon be traced to an unresolved Oedipus com plex. Sachs argues further that "the situation which occurs in Hamlet is common to all humanity, and this is the primary reason why Shakespeare's tragedy appeals to men of all races and nations" (177). Sachs' resort to "Hamlet" is nothing less than an attempt to write John's story into a universal narrative of humankind— in short I suggest that it is a radically progressive move in the political/social context of the time. For Sachs "Freudianism" was universalist and therefore conclusively a non-racist theory. However both Dubow (1993) and Vaughan (1991) have pointed out the dangers in such simple universalist assumptions, espe cially considering the ease with which such notions in the hands of more conservative and racist thinkers can be adapted to a theory of evolutionary and racial hierarchy.</page><page sequence="16">116 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference The parallels between Hamlet's and John's stories are obvious, and Sachs' narrative certainly makes sure that John's story fits the "Hamlet mould." John Chavafambira was born to a family of power and leadership. His father had died under mysterious circumstances (John suspected that his uncle Charlie had poisoned his father), and his uncle had married his mother. Sachs makes clear that John is infatuated with his mother Nesta, just as Hamlet is unable to separate himself from Gertrude. Like Hamlet, John is unable to form successful relationships with women. Finally, according to Sachs, John's devotion to medicine arises from the desire to usurp the position of his uncle. What Sachs' aims at in Black Hamlet is to show that, The structure of the "native mind" is identical to that of whites, and to demonstrate this similarity in terms of the universal applicability of Freudian analysis. ... In the context of prevailing views about race in the 1930s, the idea of extending the notion of Hamletism to the analysis of a black man would have seemed odd or even perverse. (Dubow 1993, 540-541) As we have already seen, many disputed such observations at the time, arguing for a fundamentally different nature of the "native mind." Africans were seen as being at some primitive, arrested or child-like stage of human development—the domi nant view was certainly that there were fundamental differ ences in the mental structures of "whites" and "blacks." But already in 1933 Sachs had suggested that the "the working principles of the mind" of the African and European "must also be identical in both cases" (Sachs 1933, 713). Thus Sachs' reasons for returning to Shakespeare's text are to be found in its "universal nature." It is in resorting to the story of Hamlet in Shakespeare (through Freud and Jones) that Sachs can suggest that John is like any other ("white") South African in psychological terms, and in this regard Sachs' intervention must be seen as radical beyond the limitations of a 1930s South African context. Nevertheless as Dubow points out, Sachs also sees in John</page><page sequence="17">Andreas Bertoldi 117 the "inability to cope with the rational demands of modern western life," and in this regard "Sachs is less free of the conventional views on 'native mentality' current at the time" (1993, 542). John, according to Sachs, is unable to reconcile rural and urban life. John was "forced to live a psychological 'double life,' caused by the strain of reconciling competing moral codes, religious beliefs and modes of life" (Dubow 1993, 543)—his rural upbringing had not equipped him for a different space in which he was unable to adapt. In the words of Sachs, "John . . . had an additional tragedy which shadows the life of almost every African . . . the clash of his two worlds" (1937, 174-175). Black Hamlet can thus be "seen as lending broad support to the general paradigm of 'deculturation' or 'detribalisation,' though he cannot easily be associated with the conservative implications of that framework" (Dubow 1993,543). Although I am in agreement with Dubow that Sachs is not entirely free from the ideas of his time—and how could one even expect him to be—he nevertheless provides an important counter to ethnopsychiatry. Megan Vaughan has argued that, The writings of colonial psychiatrists and psychologists provided one language, and perhaps a potent one, in which to describe and define the "African" in general and not just the "mad" African. The changing nature of African insanity itself could stand for the more general problems of colonial rule—the social and economic upheavals of industrialization and the problems of social order. But the languages of psychology and psychiatry. .. described these problems largely in terms of cultural and "racial" difference. "The African" in the twentieth century, like the European woman in the nineteenth century, was simply not equipped to cope with "civiliza tion." (1991, 107) Vaughan suggests an interesting alternative way to read the psychological and other writings of this period, including that of Wulf Sachs. An important point to remember is that</page><page sequence="18">118 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference Sachs is aware of the difficulties with his own presentation, not in the least because of the socio-political factors which enter the (psychoanalytic) equation, even though these do not really figure in his "analysis" of John. In considering his theory of "Hamletism," Sachs writes: In Hamlet's case, as shown by Shakespeare, the weakness is localised to the one question of killing the uncle; in John's case it was more generalised, for there were many other factors, as we have seen, which were responsible for this inertia and lack of decision. (1937, 181) These "other factors," as Sachs will make explicit in his altered 1947 edition of Black Hamlet published as Black Anger, are the socio-political realties of living in a racially segregated society, built on the exploitation of racially defined cheap labour in primary extractive industries. What Sachs in fact confronts, but does not deal with, are the very political limits of psychoanalysis in a colonial or apartheid society—limits re vealed in the failure of his analysis as well as the narrative itself. Sachs, in order for his argument to succeed, must explain John's hesitation and difficulties in term of "Hamletism" and Oedipus. But it seems difficult to reduce John's social and political obstacles to such a configuration. This is highlighted in particular by the fact that the "resolution" of John's prob lems seems to have less to do with a psychoanalytic resolution, than the very material interventions of Sachs himself! What is in dispute is the attribution of a classically Oedipal neurosis to John (recall here Fanon's objections), as his "cure" is effected by external (i.e. non-psychic) factors, and in the end 'John's Oedipus and its resolution is in actual, rather than psychic history" (Van Zyl and Bowyer 1994, 9). Simply John's "neurotic" behavior may just as well be the result of the practical material difficulties of living in a racially segregated capitalist society. As Van Zyl and Bowyer (1994) argue: Sachs may have put the fact and form of Oedipus into the position of a universal psychic structure which is the</page><page sequence="19">Andreas Bertoldi 119 product of culture per se, and not a particular culture, however he fails to recognize the implications of the fact that the resolution of Oedipus depends upon contin gent historical and cultural factors. (9) The upshot of these concerns with Sachs' interpretation is that it leaves the post-colonial critic, especially the psychoana lytically inclined one, with a major dilemma. If the argument via the universality of Oedipus presents difficulties, then what are the alternatives? Is psychoanalysis nothing but "coloniza tion by another means," that is, a Euro-centric, culturally specific mode of investigation? However, any adequate interrogation of these issues re quires us to look at Oedipus and its function in psychoanalysis, since it is only through the figure of Oedipus that Sachs can present his argument. The argument for "Hamletism" is de pendent upon finding the presence of Oedipus—which would ensure that arguments for racial psychic differentiation be come spurious. V. Oedipus, Universalism and Racism The relationship between psychoanalysis, evolutionism and racism is a vexed one, but one that requires some addressing, especially in light of the post-colonial attacks. Jacqueline Rose in her recent book, States of Fantasy (1996b) makes the interesting point that, In writing Black Hamlet, Sachs saw himself as effecting a dialogue across racial boundaries. Racism, he believed, could be countered by demonstrating that the uncon scious of the Western and the African "native" was fundamentally the same. What might appear at first glance as the ultimate gesture of literary appropriation (Shakespeare goes to slumtown), the clearest case of psychoanalysis in its specious universalizing mode (your unconscious is the same as mine) turns out to be, as well as all of that, part of a claim for the radical destabilizing</page><page sequence="20">120 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference power of the unconscious. If fantasy moves across the racial front line, it is not only the ego's self-possession that flounders; such mobility also gives the lie to the doctrinal and symptomatic rigidity of racial difference doing its deadly work above ground. (49) However what Rose also points out is the paradox that "the most rigid racial categorizations and a belief in a universal family of man can belong equally to the rhetoric of racism" (50). But for Sachs, as Rose agrees, psychoanalysis was a "discourse of justice," and in the narrative, especially in the 1947 version as Black Anger, "passes into the service of a revolutionary ideal" (80-81). Psychoanalysis has an uneasy relationship to anthropology. Although the figure of the "primitive" is crucial to Freud's psychoanalytic speculations, especially his phylogenetic accounts, notably Totem and Taboo (1912-1913), its usage is far from clear. The argument Freud presents for the similarity between the sexual life of "savages" (primitives) and neurotics, as well as the need for external control (prohibitions, etc.) due to a weak super-ego are well known, and will not be rehearsed here. Suffice it to say that although Freud's writings on "primitives" to a large extent reflect the views current in his day (especially evolutionist ideas), he does insert some radical viewpoints. Specifically Freud rejects the idea of the "primitive" as being characterized by unrestrained libido, and reveals primi tive society as complex and highly repressive. For Freud the "primitive" has nothing to do with race, but rather relates in the final instance to a characterization of mental functioning and ways of viewing the world. Freud himself cautions against pushing the "analogy of neurotics" and children too far (1913, 224). Ernest Jones has argued that the equation between primi tive and infant has been misconstrued. What is at stake is not the primitive acting like a child, but rather a difference "between two modes of thinking which are present in both (adult and child)" (Quoted in Rose 1996b, 51). All of this of course simply begs the question as to whether or not Africans in the twentieth century under colonialism or apartheid can legitimately be</page><page sequence="21">Andreas Bertoldi 121 defined as "primitive" according to a Freudian schema—I suggest not, but will not pursue this idea further here. In addition to Freud's own caution and specific views on the "primitive," there is good evidence to suggest that Freud strongly opposed any racial use of the term. At stake is the extent to which psychoanalysis, and especially its Freudian version, relies on an explicit or implicit racism. In the more extreme arguments against psychoanalysis in Africa, the post colonial criticism has extended itself to the claim that psycho analysis contains a racial hierarchy in spite of, or rather, because of, its universalism. Stewart (1976) has suggested that we should read psycho analysis, and Freud's pursuits, against the moralistic currents of his age—especially the idea of moral degeneracy as being inherent in madness. Tracing the emergence of post-Darwin ian thought in biology and French neuropsychology, notably in Freud's erstwhile teacher, Charcot, Stewart observes how Freud was initially seduced by Charcot's ideas concerning the etiology of hysteria and "nervous disease"—locating its origins entirely in heredity—the idea of "degeneration." But by 1893, Freud was questioning Charcot's hereditary theory. Stewart's suggestion is firstly that the initial rejection of Freud in Europe, and in Germany especially, can be under stood as being in line with the dominant view of the organic and hereditary origins of "nervous disease," and was bolstered by theories of racial and family degeneracy in vogue at the time. Secondly Freud's own rejection of the idea of the hereditary origins of mental disease can be understood as a reaction to the racial theories prevalent at the time. As Stewart points out, it was at the time that Freud was in Paris, in 1896, that Gustav Le Bon published a paper on the inheritance of psychological racial attributes. As Stewart (1976) comments, Sometimes, one must be reminded that Freud did not conceive of his sexual etiology in a social vacuum. When one considers the environment in which Freud devel oped his criticism of hereditary disposition, it becomes clear that any concept of organic degeneracy, given its</page><page sequence="22">122 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference racial undertones, was totally unacceptable to him. [... ] The rejection of the idea that the neuroses were based primarily on a hereditary disposition was the key to Freud's discovery of sexual etiology. Such sexuality was found to exist within the family, in particular through the Oedipus complex, and therefore sexual etiology was an alternative, rather than contradictory, hypothesis to that expressed by the Charcot school. Hence, sexuality still had a parallel organic element however limited. (221; 227) This brings us back to Oedipus—once more. There has been a great deal of mystification around Oedipus, attributing a variety of almost sinister motives to psychoanalysts who insist on its presence. As mentioned earlier, the "anti-oedipal" politics of post-colonialism are well rehearsed and would suggest that endeavors such as Wulf Sachs' be dismissed as yet another attempt to deny "difference" and impose an oedipal structure— "psychic colonization." However, just as there can be no naïve celebration of universalism in the wake of post-enlightenment abuses, so caution is also required in any celebration of differ ence. What I argue is that a politics of difference as expressed in post-colonial criticism might in fact entail a denial of the very goals it strives for. This can best be illustrated in looking at Oedipus. For Wulf Sachs, Oedipus is a bond of a common humanity, as well as being the source of our cultural differences. The implication of the post-colonial position is to deny this, to argue for the fundamental "otherness" of the African. I suggest that in doing so post-colonialism in fact colludes with the very structure it seeks to undermine, especially in South Africa with its almost unique history of obessionality with the construction and legislation of difference. Norval (1995) has argued that underlying and structuring apartheid discourse was in fact a principle of difference, with its emphasis on groups and cultural difference—resulting in apartheid legislation or the policy of "separate but equal." Almost ironically the principle of difference became a univer sal in apartheid discourse—just as it seems to have become a universal in post-colonial discourse. Norval writes:</page><page sequence="23">Andreas Bertoldi 123 This principle of difference was considered to be univer sal, while manifesting itself variedly in different histori cal circumstances. What is crucially important about this theological vision, is that it was easily linked to debates on the nature of apartheid, especially insofar as its identity was predicated on its opposition to liberalism and communism. In the wider context of a discussion of terminological distinctions between volk, nation and race it was, for example, argued that the God-willed diversity and separateness of nations had to be set in contrast to the liberal ideal of "deadly uniformity" which left no place for differentiation. (34) These onto-theological debates were easily articulated with current anthropological views on ethnic difference at the time. As Norval (1995) writes: The theory of "culture contact" was developed within the new context of a fascination with ethnicity as a basis for social division. [ . . . T]he task of anthropology (volkekunde) was held to be the study of cultures, pro cesses of cultural contact and the outcomes of such contact. Culture contact was considered to contain in herent limits. At worst, when its limits were reached, conflict and racial tension would result in the destruc tion of different peoples. At best, it would lead to what was called "secondary accretion," or the taking-over of cultural elements from a superior culture. Such accre tion would produce "confused beings," "Euro-Africans," which, finally, could lead only to a degeneration of morals, instability and a loss of principles. These argu ments culminated in an emphasis on the retention of traditional values, such that ethnicity came to be the bearer of all national and cultural values. (35-36) Megan Vaughan commenting on colonial medical dis course, has observed a similar preoccupation with difference. Initially it was based on biological "race," but as is evident from the history of social anthropology in South Africa, it shifted to</page><page sequence="24">124 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference categories such as "black," "white," "ethnic" groups, "tribes," "primitives," etc. (It must be admitted that this entire discussion is an indication of the "hold" that "group thinking" still has on almost every South African academic and writer.) However as Vaughan also argues, unbridled universalism is not an adequate response—firstly because it is very likely to gloss over some very real differences (cultural variation, etc.), and secondly it re mains trapped in the very opposition of sameness/difference. In short, the simple and unproblematic opposition between differ ence and universalism cannot in fact be sustained on any basis. There is a complex interrelationship between the two, such that the valorization of one or the other is bound to be problematic. This debate on universalism has been around at least since Plato, and has been a perennial preoccupation of phi losophers. These debates have concerned themselves in the first place with the existence of universals and particulars (initially an ontological concern, but more recently an episte mological one), and secondly with issues of ethics (the universalisability principle). The specificity of these debates however falls outside of our immediate concerns—even though I suspect that serious confusion and conflation has taken place in current "theory" which will one day have to be unraveled. However it does lead to the question, what is at stake in the universality of Oedipus? My response would be, not just the veracity or applicability of psychoanalysis, but an ethical stance. An ethical stance as matter of choice and politics, rather than as an inherent feature of universalism. Thus the current post colonial argument is rather paradoxical. On the one hand psychoanalysis and psychoanalytically inclined critics are at tacked for their ethnocentrism and even racist assumptions, while on the other hand these post-colonial critics wish to see an acknowledgment of difference—and claim this recognition in the name of a "right"—a right that I suggest can only be a universal if it is to have any meaning. Yet before I proceed with the ethical and political issues, I think that the overall attack on psychoanalysis is misguided and in fact relies on a straw-man of psychoanalysis. What can be shown is that psychoanalysis, at least in its Freudian variety, is fully aware that all cultures are not identical. However psychoanalysis does not posit these based on a hypostatization</page><page sequence="25">Andreas Bertoldi 125 of "culture," "race," etc., but rather seeks to reduce them to their universal ontogenetic origins—primarily I would argue the differential resolution of Oedipus. It is in Oedipus rather than anywhere else that we can in fact see this at work. Tambiah (1990) raises some interesting questions con cerning the question of relativism regarding the psychic unity or diversity of mankind (human universals) and the unity or diversity of cultures and societies. He argues that the "doctrine of the psychic unity of mankind or human universals and the doctrine of diversity of cultures/societies are not contradictory dogmas" (112). Tambiah lists a range of basic human capaci ties and operations that should be considered universal: sen sory and motor skills, cognitive structures and processes associ ated with learning, and memory and language. These human universals, he suggests, are entirely consistent with the fact that there exist a diversity of cultures/societies. The diversity of cultures, he argues, can be accounted for as a result of adaptation to environmental conditions and what he terms the capacity for "meta-learning" (113). Tambiah goes on to argue against strong cultural relativ ism, a position that he claims contains a logical contradiction in "that it makes a non-relativistic general claim about a relativistic assertion" (128). In other words it is an attempt to extract a universal principle out of the facts of difference/ relativism. Furthermore as Tambiah argues, few would want to endorse the ethical implications of such a position, which would in essence negate any international universal human rights programme or opposition to injustice. This does not however entail a vulgar universalist (anti-relativist) position. What has happened in post-colonial criticism is that ethical and political claims have been tied to essentialist identities. However universalism must necessarily entail a critical stance in regard to these essentialist notions (especially from a psychoanalytic perspective). In addition what is often forgotten is that a claim to difference, usually based on a human rights discourse, rests precisely on an abstract univer salism. As such the very recognition of the particular rests on the assumption of a universal. Although it may seem absurd to some, I would argue that Oedipus is precisely a mechanism which is at once universal</page><page sequence="26">126 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference and particular, in that on the one hand it sets out universally applicable ontogenetic features which reveal the "unity of humankind," while at the same time accounting for particular social/cultural difference. This becomes clearer when we understand Oedipus not as some European, Victorian sexual myth, but rather as the fundamental mechanism that ensures the transition from nature to culture. In short Oedipus exists as a result of the opening of the gap between sexuality in its instinctual form and its cultural outcome. To close the nature/culture gap would in essence be to argue against the necessity for Oedipus (and the incest prohibition). However (and this all anthro pologists seem to agree on), there is no culture that does this, i.e. all cultures expend a great deal of energy on reproducing themselves both materially (species) as well as culturally. As Laplanche and Pontalis (1973) summarize the debate, The Oedipus complex is not reducible to an actual situation. [ . . . ] Its efficacy derives from the fact that it brings into play a prescriptive agency (the prohibition of incest) which bars the way to naturally sought satisfaction and forms an indissoluble link between wish and law. [... ] Seen in this light, the criticisms first voiced by Malinowski and later taken up by the "culturalist" school lose their edge. The objection raised was that no Oedipus complex was to be found in certain civilizations where there is no onus on the father to exercise a repressive function. In its stead, these critics postulated a nuclear complex typifying one or another given social structure. In practice, when confronted with the cultures in question, psycho-analysts have merely tried to ascertain which social roles—or even which institution—incarnate the prescriptive agency, and which social modes specifically express the triangular structure constituted by the child, the child's natural object and the bearer of the law. Such a structural conception of the Oedipus complex conforms to the thesis put forward by Claude Lévi-Strauss who . . . makes the prohibition against incest the universal law and the minimal condition of the differentiation of a "culture" from "nature." (286)</page><page sequence="27">Andreas Bertoldi 127 Thus it seems incontrovertible that there is a necessity for an Oedipus as a result of the nature/culture distinction. The question then becomes one of the details or ingredients making up the culturally specific forms of Oedipus. Freud's particular account involves the Oedipus complex located in the nuclear family. He however does not endorse this Oedipus nor does he suggest that this specific form is universal (but no sustained argument to this effect is really present in his work). For Freud the Oedipus complex is fundamental and consti tutive of our very subjectivity. Oedipus explains how the body in nature becomes the body in culture and how the psychic apparatus is divided—a division that transforms sexual instincts into culturally determined drives. In short Oedipus for Freud is essential to the process of enculturation or "civilization" (in its non-pejorative usage). Thus post-colonial criticism's suggestions that Oedipus does not exist fail to take into account the implications of this non-existence of Oedipus in Africa—in effect the supposition (at least in Freudian terms) that Africans are not enculturated and have no super-ego. Freud suggests that the heir to Oedipus is necessarily the super-ego, and thus like Oedipus, the super-ego must be a universal feature of the psychic apparatus. However the issue is far from clear, especially as Freud himself will write that, "one gets the impression that the simple Oedipus complex is by no means its commonest form, but rather represents a simplifica tion or schematization" (1923, 372)—in other words it has variable forms and thus variable outcomes. But Freud (1923) does write: The differentiation between ego and id must be attrib uted not only to primitive man but even to much simpler organisms, for it is the inevitable expression of the influence of the external world. The super-ego, accord ing to our hypothesis, actually originated from the experiences that led to totemism. (378) This suggests that the super-ego is indeed a universal feature of humanity. These comments should be read together with Freud's suggestive ideas of "the secular advance of repres sion in the emotional life of mankind" (1900, 366) and the</page><page sequence="28">128 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference arguments put forward in his "The Future of an Illusion" (1927), where Freud writes: It is not true that the human mind has undergone no development since the earliest times and that, in con trast to the advances of science and technology, it is the same today as it was at the beginning of history. We can point out these mental advances at once. It is in keeping with the course of human development that external coercion gradually becomes internalized; for a special mental agency, man's super-ego, yokes it over and in cludes it among its commandments. Every child presents this process of transformation to us; only by that means does it become a moral and social being. (190) Although Freud does not say so explicitly, the upshot of his argument is that there have been changes in the organiza tion of the psychic apparatus, and the outcomes of Oedipus and super-ego formation are culturally variable. In this regard, Sprio (1985), has argued in light of the anthropological debates and evidence, that the Oedipus complex has three important dimensions—structure, intensity and outcome— and can display cross-cultural variability in all three. He writes: Cross-cultural variability in the outcome of the Oedipus complex is anthropologically important because its out come has social and cultural consequences. [ . . . ] The latter differences are especially marked when we com pare societies in which extinction and repression are the dominant outcomes with those in which incomplete repression is dominant. [ . . . ] Those societies in which incomplete repression is the dominant outcome of the Oedipus complex are societies in which the implementa tion of the taboos on mother-son incest and father-son aggression by the enculturation and socialisation tech niques ... is not entirely successful in achieving their internalisation. This being the case, rather than relying on the boys own psychological resources—extinction, repression and reaction formation—to ensure compli</page><page sequence="29">Andreas Bertoldi 129 ance with those taboos, many of those societies achieve compliance by means of social and cultural resources, as well. (458) What all of this suggests is that we may very well concede to the universality of Oedipus, but attribute a historically contingent status to the particular form of resolution that a specific culture calls for, and thus the historical and cultural variability of the form and structure of the super-ego. Or in the words of Juliet Mitchell (1975): Freud gave the name of Oedipus complex to the univer sell law by which men and women learn their place in the world, but the universal law has specific expression in the capitalist family. (Anthropological arguments that make the Oedipus complex general without demarcat ing its specificity are inadequate; political suggestions that it is only to be found in capitalist societies are incorrect. What Freud was deciphering was our human heritage—but he deciphered it in a particular time and place.) (409) VI. Some Conclusions - Universalism and Politics As suggested earlier, the interrelationship between univer sality and particularity is complex and its formulation has a long history. What the current literature suggests, which I would like to endorse, is that there is no clear dividing line between the two. As such post-colonial claims for difference are in fact misguided and fail to acknowledge their complicity in universalism. As Ernesto Laclau (1992) has put it, An appeal to pure particularism is no solution to the problems we are facing in contemporary societies [we may add post-colonial ones]. The assertion of pure par ticularism, independent of any content and of any appeal to a universality, is a self-defeating enterprise. [ . . . ] If</page><page sequence="30">130 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference particularity asserts itself as mere particularity, in a purely differential relation with other particularities, it is sanctioning the status quo in power relations between groups. This is exactly the notion of "separate develop ments" as formulated in apartheid. . . . (87-8) There can never be any pure difference or particularity independent from any universal assumptions. The concept "the universal" is fundamentally "equivocal" rather than "univo cal" (Balibar 1995, 48), and thus any argument or discussion cannot proceed from a simple opposition between universality or universalism and its supposed "other," particularity or particularism, difference, singularity. Universalism is thus not a "simple" notion, as the very fact that racism can be a form universalism suggests (see Balibar 1994 for this argument). For writers such as Balibar this ambiguity and difficulty, as well as the problematic history of enlightenment thought, should not lead to the total dismissal of universalism, but rather its retention as an ideal. Having said this, Balibar is adamant that "universality as symbol/ideal," which he sees as part of the struggle for freedom and equality—general emancipation—also "intro duces the notion of the unconditional into the realm of politics" (1995, 65). He terms this "equaliberty"—to suggest that hu man rights, equality and liberty are ultimately inseparable. This "equaliberty" he posits, is an "all-or-nothing notion: it cannot be relativized, according to historical or cultural condi tions, but it is there or it is not there, it is recognised or ignored (as a principle, or better, as a demand)" (1995, 65). Just as a simple and naïve presentation of universalism as "the Good" cannot be set forward, so the generalised and uncritical celebration of difference cannot be entertained in ethical or political considerations. This is perhaps where post colonial criticism reaches its own limit—its incapacity to ground any ethical stance or truly liberating political action. This paradox has been summarised extremely well by Carusi ( 1991 ) : The fundamental contradiction ... is that which exists between theories of post-colonialism as ethical discourses,</page><page sequence="31">Andreas Bertoldi 131 and the retention of the category of otherness. An ethical gesture informs both the critiques of imperialist discourse undertaken by these theories, and the at tempts to define what reconstitutive discourse would and should look like. Universalisability is characteristic of an ethical or moral judgement, in that the principle of universalisability is a formal feature thereof. In other words, when making an ethical judgement, which yields norms for social and political behaviour, this judgement and these norms must in principle be universally valid. This is so because in making a valid ethical judgement the person or people doing so must firstly be prepared to put themselves in the position of the other: that is, they must be prepared to universalise the judgement and the norms it yields so that it is equally applicable to themselves and others. This is not possible unless there is some way in which others can be recognised as the same as the person or people making the judgement. Theories of post-colonialism will immediately point out that the principle of universalisability is imperialist be cause it absorbs others into homogeneity with the West, and ignores their specificity. This can be countered by the fact that the principle of universalisability, by its very structure and its formal necessity, makes its Western provenance irrelevant. The principle of universalisabilty lends itself to being appropriated by all, and in fact is implicitly appropriated in all forms of anti-imperialist action. (146) How this is best to be done remains open to question. What I would like to suggest is that in the light of the intellectual, social and political context, the psychoanalytic interventions of Wulf Sachs must be seen as radical beyond the confines of his time. His universalist procedure effectively presents a counter-argument to the theorists of "difference," without implying a necessary homogenizing or "colonizing" attitude. However it remains to be stressed that although the psychoanalytic method and its Oedipal schema do not neces sarily imply Euro-centrism or colonization by other means,</page><page sequence="32">132 Psychoanalysis and the Politics of Difference neither does it suggest a definite ethical outcome. In short, there cannot be established any definite link between a method or theory and an ethical or political aim. The difficulties surrounding universalism however should be acknowledged, but, to give Balibar (1995) the last word, This situation does not seem to me to imply that we should give up the notion of universality, or view it as a mystification or an "idol," or try to establish instead one of its opposites in the position of a "Master Word" of philosophy (such as the Singular, or the Difference, or the Particular). Rather ... it should lead us to accept the scattered meaning of the universal, and elaborate the passages between its different modalities. The philo sophical project would thus become to articulate these differences, to seek an "intelligible order" between them—which is always, in the last instance, a matter of ethical and political choice rather than pure speculative or theoretical construction.
