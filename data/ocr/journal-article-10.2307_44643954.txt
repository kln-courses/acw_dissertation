SEAT BELTS FOR PASSENGER CARS have for many years proved their efficiency in protecting occupants during accidents. Much work has been devoted to their development. This has resulted in restraint systems capable of protecting occupants in frontal barrier crashes at 30 mph. These efforts have, however, with few ex- ceptions been focused on the front seats. There are several reasons for this. The most obvious one is that the usage rate of the front seats is much higher than that of the rear seats. In many countries the rear seats are not even fitted with seat belts. The probability of being injured for an unbelted occupant is by Walz et al (1)* and Huelke et al (2) in 1978 reported to be lower for the rear seat. Norin et al in 1980 found, however, in a study of 2000 accidents with Volvo cars, that when age distribution was taken into account, the risk of injury was not less for the rear seat (3). When the rear seat is occupied it is important that the seat belt is used and has good restraint performance. The injury risk will not only be reduced for the rear occupant, but also for the occupant in the seat in front of him. Norin et al found that the injury- reducing effect of seat belt use in the rear seat is about 28% for adult occupants (3). Accidents where unbelted rear seat occupants have injured belted front seat occupants were reported by Waltz (1) and Huelke (2). Waltz found that unbelted rear seat passengers represented a significant hazard for the corresponding front seat occupants. The criteria which are most widely used to express the effectiveness of a restraint system in tests with antropomorphic dummies are HIC (Head Injury Criterion), chest acceleration and * Numbers in parenthesis designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT A rear seat belt system with a submari- ning-preventing seat design was developed. The seat has a contoured floor pan with a pronounced ridge at the front end and a seat belt with carefully located attachment points. Sled tests simulating 30 mph barrier crashes were run with both a standard Part 572 dummy and a Part 572 dummy with a modified pelvis. Both dummies had pelvis mounted submarining indicators. Comparative tests were run with a rear seat with a flat floor pan. The tests proved the efficacy of the ridge type seat in preventing submarining as well as giving low injury criteria. The modified pelvis was found to have submarining characteristics slightly different from the Part 572 pelvis. Under certain conditions the submarining indicators were capable of detecting when the lap belt loads the abdomen, but failed in some cases where the pelvis rotation was excessive. 2406 0096-736X/82/9003-2406$02.50 Copyright 1982 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">femur force, as expressed in the requirements of the FMVSS 208. These criteria do however not take into account all aspects of restraint system performance. SUBMARINING One example of this is submarining, by some authors reported as a cause of serious injury among belt-restrained occupants of passenger cars. Submarining is used in more than one meaning describing adjacent phenomena. The most common definition and the one used in this paper is that the lap belt slips off the pelvis iliac crest into the soft part of the abdomen with risk of injury to the abdominal organs as well as the lumbar spine. Another sometimes used definition is applied on restraint systems with only a diagonal belt and refers to the phenomenon when the lower part of the body moves forward to such an extent that the diagonal belt slips upwards on the torso against the throat, with risk of throat and neck injury. The reported frequency of submarining injuries in accident surveys varies but is in general low. Nieder et al in 1977 (4) reported that out of 410 belt-restrained occupants who sustained injuries of AIS 2 or more, evidence of submarining were found in 3% of the cases. Norin et al found however no evidence of submarining in the earlier mentioned study (3). The problem of submarining has also been reported from impact simulations using anthropomorphic dummies by among others Leung et al 1979 (5). Fig. 1 - The Volvo Concept Car VCC, a research project containing subsystems which can be used in future Volvo production vehicles REAR SEAT DEVELOPMENT Although the reported frequency of submarining injuries in real accidents is low, it has by many authors been mentioned as a possible cause of serious injury. Considering this, we decided that means of preventing submarining should be incorporated in the design criteria when developing a new rear seat restraint system within the framework of the Volvo Concept Car (6) (Fig. 1). The design characteristics of a restraint system influencing the occurence of submarining have been discussed by States 1980 (7) and Adomeit 1975 (8) and 1979 (9). Both provoke a stiffer seat than is normally used with a thin comfort padding at the forward part of the seat and a stiff or energy-absorbing structure below this. The restraint concept chosen for the new rear seat was a seat with a stiff contoured floor pan covered with foam. When designing the seat and the seat belt, the intention was to prevent the pelvis from moving forward and downwards. Doing this, it is possible to keep the angle between the lap belt and the horisontal plane big and also reduce the pelvis rotation during the restraint phase, thereby decreasing the risk that the belt slips over the iliac crest into the abdomen. The final design has a contoured floor pan with a pronounced ridge at the front end (Fig. 2). The seat cushion has the greatest thickness below the buttocks of the occupant, and the thickness gradually decreases up to the front edge of the cushion. The belt is a three-point continous-loop retractor belt. y ' OCCUPANT CONTOUB^ J /'j y' 1 FLOOR PAN Fig. 2 - Principal outline of floor pan and seat cushion for new ridge type seat 2407</page><page sequence="3">2408 B« LUNDELLf ET Ali* During normal use, the thickness of the cushion is sufficient to provide good riding comfort . Another important factor in preventing submarining is the location of the lower anchorage points of the belt. To find the most effective locations of these was one important part of the development work. Together with the above mentioned properties of the seat design, a few additional features may be mentioned. The shape of the floor pan efficiently prevents the seat cushion from sliding forwards during a crash, which adds to the good pelvis restraining. Another advantage, as compared with a conventional rear seat is the extra room provided below the floor pan which in the Volvo Concept Car permitted the location of the fuel tank below the seat, away from the rear end of the car, with low fuel leakage risk in case of a rear end impact. Further, the forward mounting of the rear axle suspension system could be located in the area below the ridge. DESIGN VALIDATION The initial testing of the new design was performed in a test rig on a Bendi x sled. A substantial number of tests were run in order to prove that the basic design ideas were sound and to find the most effective shape of the seat and location of attachment points. These tests showed that the seat design effectively prevents submarining of anthropomorphic dummies of different sizes, the 5th percentile female, the Part 572 and the 95th percentile male. Injury criteria were also found to be low. This test series was followed by a second with two dummies placed in a car body on a sled. These tests are discussed further below. TEST METHOD The tests were performed on a Bendix sled, upon which was mounted a car body. The acceleration pulse simulates a barrier crash in 30 mph, the pulse shape was chosen to be typical for a vehicle of the size of the Volvo Concept Car (Fig. 3). The velocity change of the pulse is 32.5 mph, and thus corresponds to a 30 mph crash with a rebound velocity of 2.5 mph. Two car bodies were used in the series. The first was equipped with the ridge type seat. With the purpose to further study the effectiveness of this design, tests with a second body were also performed. This body was identical to the first in all respect except from that the ridge type floor pan was replaced with a flat horizontal floor pan with a correspondingly thicker seat cushion. This cushion was securely fixed not to slide forwards during test. CM 400r E S 200 - P' OC W N - / N. UJ / X. UJ I ' 8 UJ o' V_ &lt; I i i i i i 0 20 40 60 80 100 TIME-ms Fig. 3 - Sled acceleration pulse In order to create a realistic interior, the body was equipped with front seats. During a test, the lower part of the legs will to some extent load the front seats. This will reduce the dynamic load on the pelvis, and probably have a submarining - preventing effect. The most severe situation will then be with the front seats in the most forward position, and this position was used during all tests. The lower attachment points were located so that the angle between the lap belt and the horisontal plane was approx. 60 degrees. Polyester webbing with 10 percent static elongation was used. The retractor was of ELR-type, mounted immediately below the pillar loop. The amount of webbing on the retractor was approximately 500 mm. High speed cameras were mounted on the sled, two on each side. One of these filmed an overall view, while the other filmed a close-up view of the pelvis. A fifth camera filmed the inner part of the pel vi ses from above. Force transducers were mounted on the diagonal belt above the shoulder and on the lap belt close to the outer belt attachment point. Two Part 572 dummies were used. They were equipped with conventional head and chest accelerometers and femur force transducers. They also had submaring indicators and one of them had a modified pelvis, discussed further below. SUBMARINING MEASURING TECHNIQUES - There exist several approaches on how to best indicate submarining. Some of them focus on measuring the forces on the iliac crest in combination with lap belt forces. By evaluation of the peak forces it can be seen whether a submarining has occurred or not. Another method has "switches" on the crest of the hip bone and signals from these switches indicate when the lap belt slips over the iliac crest. The Association Peugeot-Renault (APR) has developed a method which concentrates on the</page><page sequence="4">REAR SEAT BELT SYSTEM 2409 actual forces acting on the abdomen (5). These forces are measured by two dynamometers placed in the abdomen and attached to the pelvis (Fig. 4). This technique allows a certain amount of submarining but as long as the measured forces are low (below an injury criterion of a suggested value of 1000 N in each transducer) no severe injuries is likely to occur. The same team has also studied the difference in tendency to submarine between the Part 572 dummy and human cadavers. They have found that the Part 572 dummy is not human like in the pelvis in some specific areas. Consequently they have developed a modified pelvis and abdomen which better resemble the human body. The dummy used in the right position in the rear seat in this study is the APR-modified dummy with reshaped satorius plane covered with soft human-like foam and a modified abdomen. The submarining transducers were mounted in this dummy as well as in the standard Part 572 dummy. The location of the transducers was the same for both dummies. The transducers were angled 20 degrees outwards from the longitudinal axis (Fig. 5). RESULTS Two tests were performed with the final ridge type seat and seat belt design. Another two tests were performed with the previously described flat floor pan. Below, these tests are referred to as "ridge seat" and "flat seat". The two dummies are referred to as "standard" (standard Part 572) and "modified" (Part 572 with APR pelvis). Head injury criterion (HIC), peak chest resultant acceleration at the 3 milliseconds level (Cr) and peak femur force (Fpemur) are listed in table 1. The peak diagonal and lap belt forces are also listed in table 1. The mean values for the two seats regarding HIC and Cr are listed in table 2. The peak forces from the pelvis submari- ning indicating transducers are listed in table 3, in which is also noted if submarining is observed on the high-speed film. An example of the output signals from these transducers is shown in fig 6 and 7. The maximum pelvis rotation and horizontal and vertical displacement in the vertical longitudinal plane were evaluated from the high-speed film, table 4. The mean values are listed in table 5. The reference point for the displacement measurements was the centre of the hip-joint (H-point). DISCUSSION The number of tests is small, and a statistical analysis of the results adds little information to what is obvious when looking at the figures. The conclusions below have however been confirmed by a non-parametric statistical analysis at the 95% confidence level. INJURY CRITERIA - The mean HIC value for the flat seat is 1126 and for the ridge seat 730, which is 35% lower and a statistically significant difference. A better result can also be seen for the chest acceleration, but the difference is not statistically significant. The femur forces are low for both seats, indicating that the influence from the front seat is low. The high-speed films show that the knees barely contact the back of the front seat. The peak belt forces do not differ between the two seats. SUBMARINING - No submarining occured with the new ridge-type seat, and these tests thus confirmed that the ridge-type seat concept is effective in preventing submarining. For the flat floor, the submarining results are more complex. A clear submarining occurred in both tests for the dummy with the APR pelvis, while the standard Part 572 dummy Table 1 - Injury Criteria and Belt Forces Femur Force Diagonal Lap belt CR, Left/kight, Belt Force, Force, Seat Type Test No. Dummy HIC g kN kN kN Ridge 1 Standard 640 35.4 3-3/1.7 6.8 N.M." 1 Modified 833 40.4 1.8/2.0 8.0 N.M. 2 Standard 673 43.0 4.5/2.1 8.0 7-7 2 Modified 772 46.6 1.4/2.4 6.2 8.2 Flat 3 Standard 964 47.0 1.8/2.0 8.2 7-7 3 Modified 1270 45.8 0.6/1.3 7.4 7.9 4 Standard 1170 43.6 1.3/1.9 8.3 7.2 4 Modified 1 1 40 45.6 .1.7/1.8 8.6 7.1 Not Measured</page><page sequence="5">24X0 B* LUNDELL, ET AL.

This difference in submarining behaviour is difficult to explain. The APR pelvis has a modified iliac crest intended to be more human like and less apt to submarine. The modified flesh of the APR pelvis is softer than the Part 572 flesh. The APR flesh was damaged at the iliac crest during the tests and had to be repaired. Our theory is that the different skin characteristics helped the lap belt slide off the iliac crest. SUBMARINING TRANSDUCERS - For the ridge type floor, the forces are not higher than 0.15 kN (Fig. 6). The suggested tolerance level is 1 kN. For the flat floor, the results from these transducers are in some respects confusing. The inboard side of the pelvis submarined for both dummies in both tests, the peak forces range from 0.65 to 1.25 kN. Although in two cases the signal is below the suggested tolerance level, there is a clear indication that the lap belt has loaded the transducer.

What did obviously happen was that the pelvis rotated to such an extent before submarining that the lap belt slipped over the iliac crest and the transducer without loading it to a significant level. A small peak in the curve occurs at 85 milliseconds and indicates the moment of submarining. PELVIS KINEMATICS - In tables 4 and 5 a significant difference regarding pelvis rota- tion and displacement for the two seat types can be seen, further showing the advantages with the new seat design. The mean pelvis rotation for the ridge type seat is 26 degrees and for the flat seat 55 degrees, over twice as much. The most obvious difference in displacement occurred in the vertical direction, the mean values 55 mm for the ridge seat and 121 mm for the flat seat. No difference was found between the two dummies regarding these kinematic parameters. However, as shown earlier, there exists a difference in resulting submarining kinematics.</page><page sequence="7">2412 B* LUNDELL , ET AL* Table 5 - Pelvis Kinematics, Mean Values (Vertical Direction Positive Downwards) Seat Type Peak Pelvis Peak H-Point Peak H-Point Rotation, Horizontal Vertical degrees Displacement, Displacement, mm mm Ridge 26 245 55 Flat 55 313 121 CONCLUSIONS The results in the tests series proved the effectiveness of the ridge type seat in combination with a three-point retractor belt, both regarding injury criteria and submarining. Comparative tests with a flat seat showed that the new seat design gives both reduced injury criteria and lower risk of submarining. In the tests with the flat floor, the modified dummy with APR pelvis had a more pronounced submarining tendency than the standard Part 572 dummy. The reason for this is not clear. One reason might be different skin characteristics. The submarining indicators measured submarining in some but not in all cases when submarining occurred. This conclusion is however based on a few tests. Further research is needed to validate this technique.
