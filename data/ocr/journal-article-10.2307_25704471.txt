ONCE WERE PEOPLE WITHOUT WRITING. THIS IS THE DOMINANT NAR RATIVE OF PACIFIC LITERATURE. SUCH A VIEW RARELY TAKES THE LACK of a recognizable alphabet or script in most of the inhabited islands of the Pacific at the time of contact with Europeans as a neutral dif ference. Lack is deficiency. Curiously, both detractors from and cel ebrants of Pacific literature agree that Pacific societies and cultures were introduced to writing by Europeans. The detractors see this originary lack as a permanent impediment to the development of worthy literature. (Few ever say, They lacked a written script, and they haven't produced any literature of note?it must be because they have a superior civilization.) The celebrants see the lack as a difference to be treasured along with the eventual acquisition of writing. So how can we better understand Pacific literature: where it came from and where it could take its readers? There are multiple discourses on and of the Pacific, so let me clarify that neither the "Pacific Rim" nor the "Asia-Pacific" is the topic of this essay. At least among anglophone scholars, "Pacific lit erature" has historically referred to fiction and other writing that emanates from the Pacific Islands region, loosely marked by Hawaii to the north, Rapa Nui to the east, New Zealand to the south, and Papua New Guinea and Belau to the west. Francophones might de scribe the same field as "litteratures de la Pacifique sud" or "littera tures d'Oceanie." But when it comes to world literatures, the oceanic region of the Pacific is still relatively unknown. In contrast to the canonized European and American texts forged out of imperialist ventures in the islands of the Pacific (from Samuel Wallis, Louis de Bougainville, and James Cook to Herman Melville, Somerset Maugham, Jack London, and even James Mich ener), the work of indigenous authors often fails to escape the cat egory of exotica.

But it would not matter if the rest of the world did not value or seek out our writing as long as we were the greatest and most ap preciative consumers of it. Ironically, however small the foreign market for published Pacific literature may be, its still larger than the do mestic market. The copies of Albert Wendts Pouliuli (1977), Epeli Hauofas Tales of the Tikongs (1988), and Sia FigiePs Where We Once Belonged (1996) bought for the handful of American university courses that assign them in a year exponentially outweigh those bought in the home countries of the authors over ten years. We are a people who do not read (at least, not much apart from daily newspapers, women's weeklies, and the good Lord's Bible). The ambivalence is internalized institu tionally. Universities that for decades were world leaders in the field of Pacific literature, such as the University of the South Pacific, with its major campus in Fiji, and the Uni versity of Auckland, have allowed their senior literary professoriat to retire without replac ing them with faculty members at a compa rable level. As neoliberal economic policies take hold in higher education, many univer sities are also cutting "non-cost-recovering" courses?how safe Pacific literature courses are where they still exist remains to be seen. How much serious attention Pacific novels, short stories, poetry, plays, and films garner when they are squeezed onto a smorgasbord of other Third World, indigenous, diasporic, and postcolonial texts also remains to be seen. It is precisely what remains to be seen about Pacific literature that I propose to tackle in this essay. For an audience unfamiliar with the region or its literature, this discussion may not be the best introduction.1 Neverthe less, if Pacific literature has not crossed your radar before, it might at least explain why, and I hope it will expand your notions of where and how to read and comprehend our oceanic writing. In short, I argue for a theory of the poly genesis of Pacific literature. I maintain that the persistent inscription of Pacific peoples lack of a history of writing before European contact and the correlated claim that Pacific literature emerges from the orature or oral traditions of Pacific people qualifies as a theory of mono genesis that inhibits the reception of the lit erature. I begin by briefly surveying evidence of the dominant trope of the oral character of Pacific societies. I suggest that overstating the significance of the introduction to the Pacific of writing as a technology has obscured a so phisticated indigenous understanding of the visual. Then I stake my claim for the visual roots of Pacific literature. The claim is based on a limited range of sources at this stage, but it is offered as a first step toward making the case that the abundance of visual and material cultural production in precontact Pacific soci eties provides viable and legitimate anteced ents to writing. Liberating Pacific literature from a singular and oral genealogical origin opens it up to multiple sources of inspiration and diverse forms of engagement. Authoritative sources date the definitive emergence of modern Pacific literature in the 1960s (Wendt, "Pacific Identities"), despite almost a century of prior literary production and publication in the form of vernacular newspapers throughout the Pacific region and despite the previous composition of at least one novel in English by a Pacific writer, Miss Ulysses ofPuka-puka (1948), by Johnny Fris bie. The publication of Witi Ihimaeras and Albert Wendt s first novels (Tangi and Sons for the Return Home) in 1973 is widely viewed as the watershed moment. Wendt went on to use his pioneering experience and exposure to serve as an unprecedented catalyst for writ ing in English throughout the Pacific, seeking out, encouraging, and publishing other writ ers all the way from Papua New Guinea to Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Kiri bati, Tonga, the Cook Islands, and Hawaii.

In some ways, then, the development of contemporary Pacific literature can be viewed as a cohesive and deliberate movement. There is certainly a strong sense of kinship between writers in Wendt s time and their successors in a "second generation," such as Sia Figiel, John Pule, Selina Marsh, and Karlo Mila (Subramani, "Oceanic Imaginary"). Many Pacific writers trace their emergence as writ ers to traditions of storytelling in their native cultures.2 In this family tree, though, I am trying to challenge the notion that the ances try is entirely oral. For some Pacific societies, contact with Europeans took place as early as 1521, when Magellan landed on the shores of Guam and encountered its indigenous people, the Chamorros; for others, such as some highland tribes of Papua New Guinea, contact came as late as the 1930s.3 Along with sometimes devastating physical effects, the arrival of Europeans brought new technologies. Much is made in historiography about the ways that steel and muskets transformed relations in Pacific societies (e.g., D'Arcy; Diamond; Howe). But when it comes to the impact of the written word, the account of William Mari ner in Tonga in 1818 is prototypical. Mariner, an English teenager, was being held captive by the Tongan high chief Finau Ulukalala when a letter from a passing ship was intercepted. Finau asked Mariner to read the letter to him and was perplexed by how the markings on the paper could transmit so much information. Finau engineered a test of this strange medium of communication. He com manded Mariner to write "Finau" on a piece of paper and then called in another captive Eu ropean, who was told to decode the markings while Mariners back was turned. The second European pronounced Finaus name accurately. Finow snatched the paper from his hand, and, with astonishment, looked at it, turned it round and examined it in all directions; at length he exclaimed, "This is neither like myself, nor any body else! Where are my legs? How do you know it to be I?" and then, without stopping for any attempt at an expla nation, he impatiently ordered Mr Mariner to write something else, and this employed him for three or four hours in putting down the names of different persons, places, and things, making the other man read them_ How their names and circumstances could be communicated through so mysterious a chan nel, was altogether past their comprehension. Finow had long ago formed his opinion of books and papers, and this as much resem bled witchcraft as anything he had ever seen or heard of. (Mariner 114-15) As the narrative proceeds, Mariner reiter ates Finau's opinion of writing, this time as "a noble invention" (116). Although there are no extant counternarratives of this exact event, the critical question to ask is, who stands to gain from the portrayal of writing as a magi cal, alien technology for the Tongans? The people who want to control it, of course. In the nineteenth century, those who wanted to control writing were Europeans and the Ton gan chiefly elite. But the power of that magi cal, alien discourse on writing seems to have persisted through to the decolonizing and postcolonial movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Wendt in his entry "Pacific Identities, Pa cific Writing" in The Pacific Islands: An Ency clopedia refers to oral literatures of the Pacific "which stretch back hundreds of years, [and] are astounding collections of mythologies, genealogies, poetry, stories, songs, chants and incantations." He asserts, "These are still the richest Pacific treasures even though most of them have not been recorded or passed on to young people through island education sys tems." Nonetheless, he goes on to emphasize that "[m]any Pacific writers continue to draw their strength from oral traditions; some reuse or reinvent ancient mythologies to map the</page><page sequence="4">125.3 ] Teresia Teaiwa 733 present, some use the techniques of oral story telling and recitation and oratory" (517). This linking of Pacific literature to oral tradition is relentless. Julian MakaVs entry on Solomon Islands in the same encyclopedia begins, "Solomon Islanders, like their regional neighbours, have strong oral traditions. His tories, rituals, genealogies, incantations and customs are handed down by word of mouth. . . ." Reina Whaitiri writes of New Zealand that "Maori continue to write in the classical genre of waiata [song], haka [dance], karakia [prayer], myths and legends" (517). For Guam, Keith Lujan Camacho writes, "[t]he richest sources of Chamorro literature are to be found in oral traditions, ranging from legends and folk tales to a variety of musical forms." The transformation of Pacific societies from this purported oral base to a literate one has been interpreted in a variety of ways. Nicholas J. Goetzfridt portrays something of a void in Micronesia when he writes that "the 'development' of writing, which has its basis in 19th century efforts to Christianize island ers, and in the educational systems of four colonial powers since the 1600s, has not pro duced a collection of published Micronesian literature" (524). The introduction of writing, according to this account, begets nothing rec ognizably expressive or creative. Marjorie Tuainekore Crocombes ency clopedia entry observes that literacy was at once widely embraced by ordinary Cook Is landers but that written texts proved insuffi ciently durable for native purposes: Until writing was introduced by the London Missionary Society in the early 1800s, oration was a refined and valued art form. The mis sionaries were amazed to find that once read ing was taught, many people learned whole chapters of the Bible by heart and could stand and recite them. Many families used writing to record their genealogies and traditions, but few survived because of hurricanes, fires, mildew, and some jealous chiefs who col lected all records of their subordinates and burned them so that chiefly authority would not be compromised. (519) Implicit in Crocombe's entry is a valuing of oral tradition for the formidable memory ca pacity it demands and a critique of the written word for its vulnerability to the vicissitudes of the island environment?hurricanes, fires, and mildew, for example.4 In the meantime, the notion that literacy attracted a particular form of censorship by elites who perceived ordinary Cook Islanders' writing as a threat to chiefly authority could offer an alternative understanding of the chronic underdevelop ment of Cook Islands writing. The political power of writing is salient in the context of ongoing colonialism in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As Rob ert Nicole recognizes in his entry on French Polynesian literature: It has sometimes been argued that writing is a culturally inappropriate medium to ex press Pacific identity and that writing reduces orality. However, written texts are playing an important role in the struggle for liberation from colonialism, as Maohi writers recon struct the indigenous past in a different way. Written texts are increasingly understood to have the potential to effect restitution and transformation. The decision to write also acknowledges that, given the French military presence, the barrel of the pen may yet be more effective than that of the gun. (528) In this scenario, the dismissal of writing as an inauthentic practice is set aside in favor of a more pragmatic view of writing as a tool of cultural and psychological as well as politi cal decolonization. Maka'a goes further to suggest that at a fundamental level, literacy enlivened and in spired Solomon Islanders: When the missionaries came, they not only tried to convince people to turn to the new God but also to set up schools where young people could learn to read and write_The 3" ft 0 t ft tA 3 &amp; 3 ft r*&gt; 3" 0 a o o w ft* IA</page><page sequence="5">734 What Remains to Be Seen: Reclaiming the Visual Roots of Pacific Literature [ PMLA w 0 0 "U 0 X H E c re V) ? sz o 4) X &lt;?* old man sitting by a fire in the evening or on a beach in the moonlight and telling a story about a boy being attacked by a giant or a shark would create very vivid pictures. But the shape and size of the shark or giant would remain ab stract. The pictures found in schoolbooks and religious material became a wonder, a dream come true. Exposure to education brought into reality vivid images of things not found in the traditional oral environment. (527) Maka a s statement seems somewhat accepting of a "deficiency" view of oral societies. What's interesting here is that its not the written or printed word alone that is considered able to fire the Solomons imagination but also printed pictures. Because The Pacific Islands: An Encyclo pedia brings together some of the indigenous movers and shapers of Pacific literature, as well as its keenest observers and scholars, it is fairly representative of trends in thinking about literacy and literature in the Pacific.51 have used this source to provide the bulk of evidence for my argument about the ubiq uity and power of the trope of Pacific litera ture's oral roots. However, as I have signaled, orature is not the sole fountain of Pacific literature or Pacific literary practices. By con tinuing to reify the roots of Pacific literature (or even simply assume that they were oral), we continue to mystify writing as a practice and reinforce it as alien. To try to portray precontact Pacific soci eties as pure is not only reductive, it ignores whole genres of systematic visual culture across the region. Greg Dening's work in The Bounty: An Ethnographic History makes the unequivocal point that visual cues and sym bols were extremely important to Tahitians. Dening refers to the use of red feathers and pennants by Tahitians in rituals of encounter with Europeans (e.g., 52-53, 56, 60-66). In Tahiti and throughout the Pacific, complex visual symbol systems have also been found in architecture, the landscape, and even markings on the human body. Roger Green, an archaeologist, postulates that there are continuities between the prototypical Lapita pottery designs of some 3,500 years ago and tapa motifs and tattooing designs in Mela nesia and Polynesia. In addition to red feath ers, pennants, Lapita pottery, painted tapa, and tattooing, Pacific societies produced an abundance of material and visual arts, such as weaving, petroglyphy, rock painting, and wood carving (Mead and Kurnot; Mead). The proliferation (and elaboration) of visual and material culture in precontact Pacific societies indicates a sophisticated understanding of the visual, which has likely been overtaken and obfuscated by the introduction of writing. One Pacific society stands out as the most likely candidate for having a written script: Rapa Nui, or Easter Island. In addition to creating moai, the breathtakingly gigantic anthropomorphic sculptures that have sur vived since as early as the eighth century, the people of Rapa Nui seem to have developed a system of symbols (or rongorongo) similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics. According to the pre vailing theory, however, the civilization that built the moai and created this script eventu ally collapsed, leaving no lasting legacy?and certainly no literary tradition?among the surviving Rapa Nui, who have lived under the neglectful colonial rule of Chile since the 1880s. Herein lies the vicious cycle of the logic of "once were people without writing": when we find a negative instance?one society in the Pacific that might have had writing?the absence of a recognizable literature produced by them in the modern era ends up bolster ing "fatal impact" types of theory, which take native cultures to be unable to withstand the onslaught of modernity. Tellingly, the most penetrating analysis of Pacific symbology is emerging, not from academics, but from an artist and cultural practitioner. The New Zealand-based Tongan sculptor Filipe Tohi has put forward what he calls a theory of lalava?or "/a/ava-ology." Examining the sennit (coconut fiber) lashings</page><page sequence="6">12 5-3 ] Teresia Teaiwa 735 found throughout the Pacific and most often used for binding beams in architecture and building canoes (but often displaced by nails and glue), Tohi was dissatisfied with under standing their design from a two-dimensional perspective. Traveling to his homeland in Tonga and to Samoa and Fiji, where lashing is still practiced, though mainly for decorative purposes, Tohi became interested in the inte rior structure of lashing and started to create sculptures that in effect modeled the lashing in three dimensions. What he has discovered and proposes is that the varying patterns of western Polynesian lashing he has been study ing intensely are not only practical but also aesthetic. Even more surprising, Tohi suggests, they are semiotic. From his three-dimensional modeling of lalava, Tohi has identified a sys tem of symbols that can be broken down into the equivalent of linguistic morphemes. Thus, becoming literate in the symbology of lalava would enable one to read narratives in the lashings {Art; PASI 301; see also Hoskin). By proposing that Pacific people had tech nologies similar to writing, I seek to demystify and domesticate, even indigenize, Pacific lit erature for Pacific people. This, I believe, raises a challenge for how Pacific literature is defined and evaluated. The perception that Pacific lit erature is underdeveloped then cannot go un challenged because the logical extension of my proposition is that Pacific literature is not just about writing but is more broadly about the visual, in addition to the oral. This anticipates what's taking place in English and literature departments around the world, where film, television, video, and digital storytelling have transformed literary analysis and criticism. Furthermore, this proposition mirrors new directions that some Pacific writers are tak ing, such as the pioneer Albert Wendt, who is blending his poetry and prose with visual im agery (Book) and who, along with scholars such as Chadwick Allen, is pointing to indigenous visual semiotics as a basis for indigenous lit erary criticism ("Tatauing"). This essay is just one effort in a nascent movement that seeks to make a critical difference in how Pacific litera ture is read, thought, and taught. Once were people without writing? Still a people without great literature? That remains to be seen. Notes 1. Sources for a proper orientation to Pacific literature include Hereniko and Wilson; Sharrad, Readings; Simms, Si lence; Subramani, South Pacific Literature; and Wendt, Lali. 2.

Longevity of exposure to the written word is not a reliable indicator of the level of literary production in Pa cific societies. Papua New Guinea has had a more dynamic literary history than Guam, for instance. The freedom of citizens to exercise political sovereignty also has varying effects on literary production around the region: New Zea land has one of the highest rates of publication per capita in the developed world, so in spite of lingering colonialism and racism, the burgeoning literary economy and infrastructure there have benefitted indigenous Maori writers, such as Witi Ihimaera and Patricia Grace, who have gained international recognition for their work. On the other hand, the most pro lific writers in English from the Pacific's last surviving mon archy, Tonga, have been not residents but emigres?Tongans living abroad, like Konai Helu Thaman and the late Epeli Hau'ofa in Fiji and Karlo Mila in New Zealand. 4. A variation on this theme can be found in David Hanlon's anecdote on Pohnpeians' unfavorable assess ment of European writing on paper for being imperma nent, unlike their own practice of tattooing. 5. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Post-colonial Litera tures in English contains similar associations between the contemporary literature and oral traditions of the Pacific (Benson and Connolly). Paul Sharrad in his entry on short fiction from the South Pacific opens definitively: "Pacific culture before white contact was village-based and functioned within an oral, performative and broadly 'mythic' and collective tradition" (1467). Norman Simms in his entry on poetry writes, "The most distinctive voices of the region remain those that produce creative varia tions of oral traditions" (1274). Works Cited Allen, Chadwick.
