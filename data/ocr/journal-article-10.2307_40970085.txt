<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD A SOCIOLOGY OF COGNITIVE STRUCTURES BY EMIL OESTEREICHER Introduction JL he clarification of the relationship between mental and physi- cal events is a problem which the social sciences inherited from philosophy. Both monistic and dualistic solutions have been proposed. The monists maintain that the nature of reality can be explained exclusively in terms of either mental or physical phenomena. The dualists make a distinction between mental and physical events and may maintain that distinct methods of investigation are required. Dualism took its most rigid form in the Cartesian parallelism between the mind and the body. There- after it was refined by Kant, who rejected the reductionism of rationalistic psychology (criticizing Leibniz for rendering sensa- tion a second-class understanding by intellectualizing appear- ances) and empiricist psychology (criticizing Locke and Hume for rendering understanding a second-class sensation by sensualizing understanding). Kant maintained that the understanding of an object always involves the imposition of a synthetic unity upon the manifold phenomena supplied by perception. Yet he did not eliminate the dualistic split between reasoning and its object: the categories of reason were not derived from the objects of experience but were accounted for by a priori "transcendental deduction." Kantian epistemology holds that the norms that determine the forms of perception are a set of a priori categories, which, in conjunction with experience, provide a necessary con- dition for meaningful representation, for all knowledge. Kant profoundly affected the development of modern socio- logical theory by providing the foundation for nearly all the major critics of Comtean positivism. The reaction against the</page><page sequence="2">COGNITIVE STRUCTURES 135 reductionism of positivism was most intensely manifested in Germany in an effort to separate as thoroughly as possible the facts of the "natural" sciences (supposedly requiring causal "ex- planation" through the method of objective description and hypothetico-deductive reasoning) from those of the "human" sciences (whose mastery requires "understanding" based upon an insight into the human mind). Thus a strict distinction is made between an Erklarende Psychologies which is to provide causal explanations for physical facts, and a Verstehende Psychologie, which is to understand mental facts. This methodological dual- ism, which has influenced the development of German historiog- raphy and sociology from Dilthey and Simmel to Scheler and Alfred Weber, received its most "objectivistic" tone in the work of Max Weber. Under the influence of the neo-Kantian meth- odology of Rickert and Windelband, Weber applied himself not only to elaborating a typology of various mental structures of "intention" by means of an act of verstehen but also to relating and coordinating these "pure possibilities' ' with the facts which are engendered by human actions in historical reality (such as the relationship between the "inner-worldly asceticism" of Cal- vinist ethics and the historical rise of capitalism). The most cogent critique of positivist reductionism and de- terminism by an American sociologist is given in Talcott Parsons' Structure of Social Action (1937). But Parsons' replacement of the passive epistemological formulation of positivism leaves normative phenomena genetically unexplained: the sets of norms which determine the teleology of the subject's activity remain beyond the sphere of naturalistic explanation. One must ques- tion the sense of constructing a sociology of action without any attempt to explain sociologically the genesis and the development of the normative structures which orient action.1 The aim of this paper is twofold; first, to offer a sociogenetic interpretation of cognitive structures; and second, to investigate i For an interesting discussion of the changing foundations of the Parsonian action scheme, see J.

The point of departure for a genetic interpretation of cognitive structures is the simple fact that the human organism is born into a physical and social environment to which it must adapt in order to survive. The process of adaptation requires activity and a coordination of activities oriented toward the external world. Activities may simply be repeated in concrete form and/ or represented in thought. From a genetic perspective, new acts may be considered as realizations of possibilities opened up by previous acts, which may, in turn, pave the way for new and wider possibilities for future acts. Thus the human subject should not be seen as a pure empiricist: he cannot perceive the data of the environment without relating these to a frame of reference already established by action. Nor should he be seen as a pure rationalist: he cannot have a purely "interior" expe- rience of the functioning of his own thought; for an awareness of one's own mental activity and of the laws which it obeys comes only retrospectively, that is, only after thought is applied to problems posed by the environment.2 One may, indeed, as- sume that cognitive structuring begins neither with immediate awareness of the environment nor with immediate awareness of the self, but rather with concrete and mental operations which relate the individual to the environment. In the social world, this same process of environmental adaptation involves a coordination of operations between two or more individuals. It will be argued here that the subject matter of a sociology of cognitive structures should be the investigation of the ways in which specific modes of cooperation between individuals condition the forms of collec- tive representations. The second part of this paper outlines a sociogenetic interpre- tation of the rise of modern science. For a simple factor analysis of the causes of the scientific revolution cannot adequately ac- 2J.

While it is important to see how certain technological, economic, and psychological factors (such as navigation, manufacturing, min- ing, or the ethical doctrine of Calvinism) contributed to the rise of science, these are not sufficient explanations for the rise of modern scientific structures. What one needs to consider is the way in which the prevailing form of operations in society relate to the operations of science. Throughout this paper special emphasis will be given to the relevant theoretical implications of the work of the Swiss psychol- ogist Jean Piaget. 1. The Contribution of Piaget Piaget's theory of cognitive functioning is rooted in his view of the biological organism as an active, open, and self-regulating system. The organism "conserves" its integrity and continuity by actively restructuring the elements of its environment as well as itself in an effort to satisfy the functional requirements of adaptation. Biological organs, once generated through function- ing, tend to perpetuate themselves by more functioning. Similarly, cognitive structures, once constructed through mental assimila- tion, have a tendency to maintain themselves by the repeated assimilation of the data of the environment.8 Thus the mental structuring of the elements of the environment to fulfill the needs of adaptation is seen as an omnipresent feature of the functioning human intelligence. The primitive man, the developing child, the modern theoretical physicist are all motivated by the same need to make some "sense" out of the influx of sensory expe- riences, to establish some sort of equilibrium between sensible experience and its representation on the level of consciousness. The coherence of these representations is assured only as long 8 J. Piaget, The Origins of Intelligence in Children (New York: W. W. Norton, 1963), pp. 4-6.</page><page sequence="5">138 SOCIAL RESEARCH as they are sufficiently flexible to incorporate the data of expe- riences. When experiences can no longer be integrated into the schema of mental construction there arises a crisis in thought and a need for the construction of more extensive schemas to restore coherence to the view of the universe.4 The range and the qual- ity of these experiences is itself determined by the range and the quality of activities that relate the individual to his environment. New activities tend to produce new experiences, the compre- hension of which requires the construction of new mental schemas. If the degree of coherence in the internalization of these concrete relations surpasses the coherence of the relations themselves, a desire for their reorganization may ensue. The mental development of the child is characterized by a succession of increasingly more general and extensive conceptual schemas and simultaneously by a gradually increasing ability to coordinate the elements of the environment into coherent sys- tems. These successive conceptual systems represent increasingly more stable states of adaptation to the environment: the more extensive and elaborate is the conceptual schema of representa- tion, the less likely it is that an influx of unfamiliar experiences will completely destroy the relative equilibrium between this schema and the data of the environment. Indeed, it is likely that a current schema will be not destroyed but expanded to incorporate new data into the existing system of relationships.5 Piaget calls these conceptual systems of relations "operations," and regards their development and coordination as the most fundamental facts of the psychology of thought. He locates the source of operations in the concrete activities of the child who, by manipulating objects, gradually coordinates his actions and eventually, with the rise of "symbolic functioning/' internalizes these concrete coordinations to form conceptual systems. While 4T. S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964). 5J.

Eventually the child becomes aware of the fact that any time he combines objects he can also dissociate them, that when he subtracts the exact amount that has been added he will have the same quantity he had started with, and that if nothing is added or taken away the quantity of the objects remains the same: it remains ' 'conserved/1 This "reversibility" of actions, according to Piaget, is the single most important characteristic of operational activity and the basis of all logical reasoning. For once the child becomes capable of returning to the original point of departure, he can repeat the same act and start to generalize the results of his activity in di- verse contexts. The extension of concrete operations upon ob- jects gradually enables him to dissociate the logical schemas of coordinations from concrete applications and to become capable of performing purely conceptual "formal" logical operations. Thus it may be said that it is the internalization of concrete oper- ations that leads to the liberation of thought from its concrete applications, to the capacity for hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The gradual coordination of activities enables the child to "decenter" from his own personal activity as well as from the elements of his environment as they appear to be in immediate perception. Prior to the development of operational thinking, the child tends to represent the universe from schemas drawn from his own activity and to attribute anthropomorphic qualities to objects. However, he gradually decenters from this "ego- centric" representation of the universe and begins to correct his notions by recognizing certain complex visual configurations in his environment. Yet this "optical realism" signifies that the focus remains "centered" upon certain perceptual features that radically delimit the flexibility of his reasoning. For example,</page><page sequence="7">140 SOCIAL RESEARCH when presented with a thin glass tube of liquid and then ob- serving the same liquid being poured into a wider glass con- tainer without anything added or taken away, he will not be able to realize that the quantity of liquid is conserved. His attention is dominated by the prominent perceptual feature (the level of the liquid) and he cannot reason by taking both variables into consideration.6 Only with the development of operational thinking can the child gradually decenter his attention from purely perceptual configurations and organize the data of his sensory experiences in terms of a decentered logical schema. Only at this point does the "principle of conservation" become, so to speak, a logical necessity, regardless of the character of prominent perceptual configurations.7 Piaget shows that this process of decentration is not accom- plished in isolation but through continuous contact with the social environment: the child's capacity to decenter seems to be contingent upon the type of social intercourse he is capable of participating in. The gradual advent of logical operations co- incides with the increased capacity of the child to cooperate with others, to exchange information, and to become aware of the "rules" of the specific communication context in which he par- ticipates. Piaget's experimental findings thus substantiate the fundamental theoretical assumptions of George Herbert Mead. By participating in increasingly more complex systems of com- munication, the child gradually and simultaneously becomes aware of himself and of the community, gradually acquiring the capacity to take the "generalized attitude of others toward him- self/1 and organize his activity in terms of these general expecta- tions. The internalization of norms does not imply a passive accept- ance of the existing nature of things. To the contrary, when 6J.

Thus the structuring of the logical operations of the child, his increasing capacity to cooperate with others, his conceptual elaboration of the physical as well as of the social universe, and his rising ability and proclivity for critical evalua- tions may be seen as parallel processes of the same development.8 2. Piaget's Sociology of Operations While a psychology of operations focuses upon the manner in which the coordination of activities influences the representations of the individual, a sociology of operations investigates the way in which the coordination of interindividual activities conditions the forms of collective representations. Thus the point of de- parture for psychological as well as for sociological investigation is a series of concrete actions, the internalized "implications" of which extend from the most elementary forms of symbolic func- tioning up to the realm of formalized logico-mathematical opera- tions. The major concern of Piaget's sociology of operations is the sociogenesis of "rules" and "values." While certain rules are engendered by the simple effort of the individual to increase the efficiency of his activity, it is only in the course of an interaction between two or more individuals that these rules may be rendered obligatory and thus exert a binding force upon the individual participants. These sets of rules structure signs (e.g., the gram- matical rules of language), values (moral and legal rules), and the most general rules of thought (logic). As has already been stated, the achievement of operatory in- telligence requires the socialization of the child's mind. In the sj.

His ability to operate logically coincides with his capacity to operate in common, that is to say, to "co-operate." Indeed, it may be demonstrated that once the cognitive processes of an individual become decentered enough to enable him to perform individual concrete operations, he becomes at the same time capable of adjusting his own operations to those of others. To take an example from Piaget: if two individuals decide to construct a bridge over a stream and place some stones on both edges as pillars and connect them with a horizontal board, this relatively simple technical activity requires a number of highly complex logical operations, without which the coordination of necessary actions could not be achieved. First, the solution of this task requires a series of qualitative operations, such as making the pillars the same shape and width. The two people have to adjust their activities to correspond to a common element (opera- tions of correspondence), to orient the vertical slopes of the pillars toward each other (reciprocity of symmetrical operations). If one of the banks is higher, it is necessary to make the corresponding pillar shorter and the other higher (an operation of addition or subtraction of complementary actions), etc. Piaget describes the complexity of the coordination of these activities: . . . if each of the actions of the collaborators which are regulated by the laws of reversible composition constitute an operation, the adjustment of the collaborators' actions to each other (that is to say, their collaboration itself) consists equally of operations: these correspondences, reciprocities, asymmetries and complementaries are, in effect, like other operations, the consequences of the re- spective actions of the collaborators. Subsequently, the concrete operations of measuring are performed: in order to obtain an equal width, each of the partners measure their pillar to adjust their measure, but this adjustment itself makes up a new opera- tion of the same nature, since in order to be able to equalize their respective measures they have to use an average or common meas- ure. Finally, they will have to determine the horizontality of the board to which they both have to adjust their respective ends; in or- der to accomplish this each of the collaborators may choose his sys-</page><page sequence="10">COGNITIVE STRUCTURES 143 tern of references but they will have to co-ordinate these two systems of co-ordinates into one; that again leads to a new operation in order to co-ordinate their respective operations. . . . [Therefore] to cooperate in action is to operate in common, that is to say, to adjust by means of the new operations (qualitative or metric) of correspondence, reciprocity, or complementarity, the operations performed by both partners. Thus all concrete collaborations, to classify the ensemble of objects in accordance with their quali- ties, to construct a topographical scheme, etc., signifies the co- ordination of the operations of both partners into an operatory system the integral operations of which are constituted by their acts of collaboration.9 The assumption that the performance of even relatively simple technical tasks requires a coordination of individual activities the structure of which corresponds to the structure of logical co- ordinations gives rise to the following question: knowing that no society can survive in the absence of technical cooperation, and assuming that the "formal operations" of logic and mathematics are but actions internalized by the means of symbolic functioning and thus freed from objects, how is it possible to account for the fact that the overwhelming majority of societies have not pro- duced such conceptual coordinations, and that the conceptual schema of logical and mathematical operations became separated from objects only in seventeenth-century Europe (Greek mathe- matics was still a mathematics of "objects") and became com- pletely dissociated from them only in the nineteenth century with the rise of "pure mathematics"? 10 An answer to this question calls for a distinction between the social sources of scientific thought and those of other forms of thought which are considered ideological. 3.

Beth, The Foundations of Mathematics (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966).</page><page sequence="11">144 SOCIAL RESEARCH Mental operations originate in action, in the sensory-motor mechanism, in the practical assimilation of reality to the schemas of sensory-motor activity. The process of decentration begins in the subject's coordination of these schemas in relation to the objects of his environment. Subsequently, with the rise of sym- bolic functioning there is a representative assimilation of reality to the initial schemas of thought, which remain egocentric since they consist not in coordinated operations but in the internali- zation of isolated actions. Only in the course of a period of intensive socialization can the child's conception of the universe gradually decenter from his affective needs and attain the degree of objectivity that is charac- teristic of operatory intelligence. However, the increased ability of the child for social intercourse does not lead to a passive and subservient acceptance of public consensus; it engenders rather a sense of equality and an intellectual competence to reflect upon and to evaluate the propositions of others. As in the realm of psychology a distinction is made between action, egocentric thought, and operatory thought, so in sociology a similar division should be made. There are various technolo- gies which express man's activity in relation to the objects of his environment. These represent the most elementary types of subject-object relationship where the awareness of relations re- mains partial because activities are linked to pragmatic results and not to the comprehension of connections themselves. Scientific or operatory thought completes and extends techni- cal activity and makes the comprehension of connections possible through the internalization of activities and the coordination of mental facts into operations of calculation, deduction, and ex- planation. These schemas may then be substituted for concrete operations. While both concrete and mental operations express an "objec- tive" relationship between the subject and his environment (both the social and the physical universe), ideologies are neither tech- nical nor operatory and consist in those collective representations</page><page sequence="12">COGNITIVE STRUCTURES 145 which ". . . center the universe upon human society, upon its aspirations and upon its conflict." n Piaget illustrates the parallel between the process of the psychogenetic and sociogenetic evolu- tion of rational thought: In the case of the development of the individual, the advent of operational thought requires a "decentration" in regard to ego- centric thought and in regard to the ego, a decentration necessary in order to allow an extension of the actions from which the operation proceeds. In parallel fashion, in the course of social development, the advent of scientific thought has always required a decentration in regard to ideologies and in regard to the society itself, a decentration necessary in order to allow for the emergence of scientific thought from the technology in which it had its roots.12 Although technical collaboration is a characteristic of all soci- eties, the rational cognitive operations of science may be en- gendered only in those societies where the internalized implica- tions of technical cooperation have ceased to be constrained and distorted by sociocentric ideologies.13 To determine how and at what point these rational cognitive operations arise is a central task of a sociology of scientific operations. 4. Some Comments Concerning the Possibility of a Sociological Approach to the Scientific Revolution Alexandre Koyre summarizes the most significant aspects of the transformation from the prescientific to the scientific picture of the universe as follows: This scientific and philosophical revolution . . . can be described as bringing forth the destruction of the Cosmos, that is, the disappearance from philosophically and scientifically valid con- cepts, of the conception of the world as a finite, closed, and hier- archically ordered whole (a whole in which the hierarchy of value determines the hierarchy and structure of being, rising from the 11 Piaget, Introduction a Vepistemologie genetique, Vol. 3, p. 242. 12 Ibid., p. 24. 13 For some studies emphasizing the sociocentric character of thought in primi- tive or traditional societies see Durkheim, 1964.

This, in turn, implies the discarding by scientific thought of all considerations based upon value-concepts, such as perfec- tion, harmony, meaning and aim, and finally the utter devaloriza- tion of being, the divorce of the world of value and the world of facts.14 At the center of this great transformation is the destruction of the rigid hierarchy that characterized the medieval notion of the universe. Man is no longer the center of the universe. Whereas in the qualitative space of Aristotle the observer occupies an absolute position and the motion of bodies is determined by their natural position in space, in the homogeneous space of classical mechanics the observer himself is placed upon a moving object (the earth) and his position as well as the position of all moving objects is determined not in terms of their relation to space but of their relation to each other. Once space is dissociated from the move- ment of the objects it loses all its qualitative properties and ac- quires a homogeneity characteristic of geometric space.15 In the absence of a qualitative space, the determination of the relative position of objects in motion requires a coordination in terms of operatory composition, not an anthropomorphic explana- tion. There is no more need to evoke terms such as "intention," "effort," and "goal" in order to account for movement and veloc- ity. The destruction of the essentially mythical Aristotelian space, the rising awareness of the relativity of motion, the gradual de- centration of the objects of the universe, engenders both an in- creasingly more complex netting of operations and the construc- tion of a series of new "invariants." 16 Thus Galileo and Newton 14 A.

The universe began to be seen as a perfect mechanism, consisting of objects moving in infinite and homogeneous space and governed by uniform, quantifiable, and universally applicable laws.17 There is a radical "equalization" and "decentration" of the picture of the universe, based upon the notion that the universe is composed of entities that are entirely similar qualitatively, and that the behavior and the interaction of these "equal" entities conform to the universal mechanical laws of nature, and take place in a perfectly homogeneous and infinite space. The tend- ency toward the "individualization" and "equalization" of the universe is beautifully illustrated by William Gilbert: The sun is not swept round by Mars' sphere (if sphere we have) and its motion, nor Mars by Jupiter's sphere, nor Jupiter by Saturn's. . . . The Higher do not tyranize over the lower, for the heaven of both the philosopher and the divine must be gentle, happy, tranquil, and not subject to changes.18 A remarkable structural parallel is apparent between the de- composition and recomposition of the picture of the universe that signifies the advent of modern science and the gradual decomposi- tion and recomposition of social relationships under mercantile and manufacturing capitalism. Both of these processes are charac- terized by what Koyr£ calls the "devalorization of being" or what Max Weber refers to as "disenchantment." Weber stresses the 17 The history of successive major cosmologies clearly demonstrates this tendency toward decentration. Thus, while Aristotle's universe was organized in terms of human activity, Newton coordinated objects from the fixed perspective of a geome- try of infinite space and time and established a system of relations both between the self and objects, and between objects. Finally, Einstein decentered this single frame of reference by realizing the possibility of a multiplicity of perspectives in the universe, giving new meaning to key concepts such as "time," "space," "force," and "mass."

Pirenne, Early Democ- racies in the Low Countries (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963); A. von Martin, Sociology of the Renaissance (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963). 20 The "commercial principle" as the basis for commodity production is the product of an historical evolution that coincides with the emergence of the middle classes to economic as well as to political prominence. By the eleventh or twelfth cen- turies, starting in the Mediterranean and later in the Rhineland, the Low Coun- tries, northern France, and England, a number of urban centers were established based upon the production of goods manufactured by guilds of craftsmen that were exchanged for the agricultural surplus of the countryside. These cities achieved a high degree of political autonomy; in Germany and Italy they became virtually independent city-states, while in France and England they remained subject to royal but not to feudal authority. By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a number of wealthy merchants ac- quired dominance over the guilds and engaged in monopolistic practices engender- ing associations such as the North German Hanse to control markets and resources at home as well as abroad. The development of navigation that enabled merchants to open up new trade routes to the East and later to the New World produced immense profits that could now be invested in productive enterprises and not only in land. Thus during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries commodity produc- tion for a market became the prevailing form of economy in part of Germany, in the Low Countries, and in the great cities of Italy. This in turn led to an in- crease in the political influence of the middle classes, especially in the Low Coun- tries and later in England where the middle classes, for the first time, gained political control of the state with the establishment of the States General of Holland (1576) and with the founding of the Commonwealth of England (1649).</page><page sequence="16">COGNITIVE STRUCTURES 149 labor, like any other commodity, is determined by the mechanism of the market, by the aggregate of demands articulated in the course of exchanges. The continuous division and coordination of labor subjects collective social entities (such as the family, the clan, the estate, etc.) to a process of decomposition, and for the first time the ' 'individual" becomes the most basic unit of social and economic existence. Now that status is achieved rather than ascribed, the individual becomes responsible for making his own "destiny/* By choosing from a multiplicity of relatively well-structured "careers," he takes his place in the network of social relations. But the decomposition of social aggregates into their individual elements is only one aspect of this general process. The "rational- ization" of human relations entails also a simultaneous process of "composition." All these atomized individual elements are now gradually integrated into a complex network of exchanges and regulated in terms of the general laws of the total mechanism. Thus each individual is confronted by the same variable and mechanical totality and his "life-chances" are contingent upon his capacity to "calculate" and predict its fluctuations. Clearly the regulations which characterize the social relations of postagricultural Occidental societies form a much more dynamic and homogeneous totality than do the natural "rhythms" of traditional societies. They are more "dynamic" because they are no longer structured in terms of such static organic phenomena as blood ties, gerontocracy, or seasonal alterations of plant and animal life. And they are more "homogeneous" because their "social space" is no longer rigidly divided into qualitatively divergent spheres (such as clans whose relations are regulated by the strict rules of exogamy, and castes and estates ruled by the equally strict laws of endogamy). The general process of "ra- tional" coordination of labor decomposes aggregates and binds individuals together by means of universal rules equally appli- cable to all throughout the entire social space. To summarize the three major structural parallels between</page><page sequence="17">150 SOCIAL RESEARCH the picture of the physical universe engendered by the scientific revolution and the social relations produced by the rise of Western capitalism: 1. A gradual dissolution of the qualitative categories of the universe. The growing "devalorization of being" dissociates "feelings" from specific "localities" and gives rise to a completely homogeneous space which no longer permits the attachment of any special qualitative value to the position of objects. Thus ob- jects themselves become equalized and their "value" is defined in relative and quantitative terms. 2. An ever-widening gap between the self and the world. A rigid distinction between the self and the world, and the self and cosmic becoming, is a crucial factor in the development of modern science: only when man's thought is separated from the duration of things can these "things" be coordinated into an operatory totality; only when the perspective becomes fixed while the ob- jects of the universe keep moving is it possible to reach the degree of decentration required for the logical netting of operations. Once existence and duration no longer seem to coincide, once the world of things is seen as separated from the world of the mind, a gap forms between being and consciousness, uncertainty arises over the relationship between what one thinks he is and what one really is, what one thinks he does and what one really does. This deep ontological ambiguity engenders an anxious quest for the restoration of the rational unity between man and the world and between man and the divine. The attempt to reattain certainty and unity can become the central effort of one's life as with the Calvinist and the Jansenist believer and the Cartesian philospher. The Protestant faithful believes that a grasp of reality requires an authentic transforma- tion, an "inner awakening" by divine intervention. The ration- alist philosopher feels he can grasp reality only by constantly subjecting the distorted data of his imperfect senses to the critical activity of his more perfect mind. Thus the split between the individual and the universe engenders a split in the self: one</page><page sequence="18">COGNITIVE STRUCTURES 151 part "empirical," one part "rational," the first being unstable, imperfect, even "sinful," the latter, stable, perfect, and even "divine." Reality now becomes a function of the coordination of these two parts of the self.21 3. A process of a systematic "decentration" from the self. In the course of this process the individual learns to place himself into a system of objects, defining his position relative to that of other objects in the same homogeneous geometric space. He be- comes a "powerless spectator" in the sense that he no longer repre- sents the universe from the perspective of a scheme centered around his own activity. The universe becomes less familiar, less "human," more abstract, more relative, and more objective. One's activities are now organized not in terms of his own needs and desires but rather in terms of uniform and mechanical laws conceiving him simply as an object in the context of other objects. This "devalorization" and "disenchantment" of the modern world can give rise to feelings of fatalism and personal inertia, and may have been instrumental both in the dethronement of the ob- server from his egocentric and geocentric delusions as well as in the construction of a homogeneous and mechanical universe whose harmonious movement seemed to have been "predestined" and eternally fixed by the Creator.22 At this point it is important to emphasize that the radical trans- formation of social relations and the concomitant process of "devalorization" provided the necessary but not the sufficient con- dition for the rise of modern science. In fact, the emergence of an independent and relatively insulated scientific community, united by shared training and experience, is probably the single most important factor in this development. While the beginnings of an independent scientific community can be traced back as far as Hellenic Greece, it was only in seven- 21 G.

During the Middle Ages scientific methodologies were still closely tied in with the personalities of individual scien- tists, who passed their "secrets" on to their pupils as medieval tradesmen passed their secrets on to their apprentices. The very existence of the modern scientific community presupposed the presence of a relatively "depersonalized" view of the world, a clear demarcation between what became regarded as "scientific knowledge" and the personality of the scientist pursuing it. Re- ciprocal exchange of "objective" and "quantifiable" information is central in the communication among modern scientists. Once information is accepted, it becomes entirely separated from the personality of the individual who supplied it and becomes in- corporated into a general schema collectively agreed upon by the members of the community. In reference to the nature of the "truth" agreed upon by the participants in a universe of scientific discourse, Piaget writes: The agreements of minds upon which truth is founded is ... not the static agreement of public opinion: it is the dynamic con- vergence that results from the employment of the common in- struments of thought, that is to say, it is the agreement which is established by means of similar operations performed by diverse individuals.23 Conclusions The relation between mental structures and social structures is a major problem in sociology. Monistic and dualistic attempts to solve this problem proved to be inadequate. The purpose of this paper has been to provide a more adequate conceptual framework for a sociological analysis of cognitive structures. It is proposed that a sociology of cognitive structures should in- vestigate the relationship between mental coordinations (the operations of the mind) and forms of social coordination (coopera- 23 Piaget, Introduction a Vipistemologie genetique, Vol. 3, p. 255.</page><page sequence="20">COGNITIVE STRUCTURES 153 tion between individuals) in the course of which these mental operations emerge. To clarify the relation between mental events and the events of the external world (physical as well as social), an analysis of the cognitive development of the child was presented. It was shown that mental coordinations are rooted in the interaction be- tween the human organism and its environment. Long before the rise of symbolic functioning the child begins to coordinate his sensory-motor activities in view of the objects of his environ- ment. By acting upon and manipulating objects he gradually be- comes aware of his own coordinations. With the rise of symbolic functioning he incorporates his extending experiences into the in- creasingly more complex, flexible, and general schemas of his mind. The structuring of cognitive activity entails a process of "decen- tration" from the "egocentric" needs of the self and from the most immediate perceptual data of the environment. The in- creasingly more complex and flexible mental structures that signify the successive stages of intellectual adaptation correspond to the successive stages of socialization. Once the cognitive proc- esses of a child become decentered enough to enable him to per- form concrete operations, he becomes simultaneously capable of adjusting his own operations to those of others. The performance of even the most elementary technical tasks by two or more in- dividuals requires a coordination of individual operations. The structure of these concrete technical coordinations corresponds to the structure of more or less complex logical relations. How- ever, one may of course successfully perform concrete technical tasks without being consciously aware of the logical rules that regulate the performance, just as one may use a language without having an explicit knowledge of the rules of grammar that regu- late the practice. In most societies the logical structure of concrete technical cooperations has never fully been abstracted. Only in seventeenth- century Europe was this abstraction accomplished fully and</page><page sequence="21">154 SOCIAL RESEARCH systematically to provide a lasting foundation for the experi- mental-deductive method of modern science. Three major factors are considered to account for the failure of precapitalist societies to embark upon the type of rational universe of discourse characteristic of modern science. 1. In a subsistence economy technical operations are likely to be directed exclusively at the achievement of practical ends and not at an understanding of the structural relations themselves. 2. In the collective representations of primitive and traditional societies the picture of the universe is centered upon the particular characteristics and needs of a given society. The sociocentric character of these representations does not permit the systematic internalization of the relations of concrete technical operations and their mental coordination into operations of calculation, deduction, and explanation. 3. Rigidly hierarchical social organizations are not likely to permit the degree of freedom necessary for the establishment of a scientific universe of discourse founded upon the reciprocal exchange of propositions between autonomously cooperating equal individuals. It is assumed that the fundamental decomposition and recomposition of social relations under mercantile and manu- facturing capitalism substantially reduced the effect of these major obstacles and permitted, for the first time, the degree of decentration required for the operations of modern science.</page></plain_text>
