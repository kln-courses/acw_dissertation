The Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic Periods in the Southern Levant New data from the site ofTeleilat Ghassul, Jordan. BAR Intern. Ser. 974. Monographs of the Sydney University Teleilat Ghassul Project 1. Oxford : Archaeopress. The recent publication of several books concerning the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic in the southern Levant have both augmented our information on this period and rekindled debates over its chronology and the nature of its sociopolitical organization. These include reports on excavations at two Yarmoukian sites, Jebel Abu Thawwab by Zeidan Kafafi and Sha'ar Hagolan by Yosef Garfinkel and Michele Miller, and synthetic works by Mark Blackham and Susanne Kerner. A book by Jaimie Lovell is really a combination of the two, focussing mainly on Teleilat Ghassul but in its regional and chronological context. NEW INFORMATION ON ASSEMBLAGES Most of these provide new information on the material culture of the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic, while the more synthetic works present new views on the analysis and inter- pretation of Chalcolithic pottery in particular. Kafafi presents some information on artifacts from Jebel Abu Thawwab, but as the pottery was previously pub- lished20, provides less new information about ceramics or 20. OBEIDAT, 1995.

Pottery is assigned to broad form classes, while the catalogue provides some details of fabric and surface treatment. Interestingly, while the architecture, figurines, and pottery are considered "in context", the chipped stone, ground stone, artifacts of shell and bone, plant and animal remains instead appear in appendices by Hisa- hiko Wada, Nabil Qadi, Bo Dahl Hermansen, Danielle Stor- deur, Reinder Neef, and Ilse Köhler-Rollefson. There is also a specialized appendix on the provenance and technology of the Early Bronze pottery by Nizar Abu Jaber, Ziad al-Sa'ad, and Raeda Quraan. These, and especially the lithics report, provide welcome, quantified details about these important assemblages, even though some, such as the bones and bone tools, have very small sample sizes. Parts two to four of the Sha'ar Hagolan report provide detailed information about the pottery, stone-tool, figurine, and plant and animal assemblages there. As in previous works by Garfinkel, there is a laudable attempt to provide quantitative information about the pottery and typology fol- lows the system used at Munhata, based on overall form, size, form details, and sometimes decoration. This also facil- itates comparisons with Munhata21. Chapters on the lithic technology, conjoinable lithics, and ground-stone tools, one co-authored with Nira Alperson and one written by Zinovi Matskevich, inform us about raw material acquisition and core reduction, describe the characteristics of the formal tools, and provide evidence on the spatial distribution of activities22. Part three of Garfinkel and Miller's book, in keeping with the book's title, deals with the art objects in terms of their typology, construction, spatial distribution, and possible function. Although Kerner mentions pottery among her criteria for defining cultural periods and groups, she does not present any new assemblages but instead discusses pottery, along with metalwork, in the context of technological changes and espe- cially increasing standardization or specialization23. It is there that we see how she analyses the pottery assemblages in terms of their construction methods, fabric groups, form classes, decoration type, and even the number of motions necessary to carry out various kinds of decoration24. Thus she comes closer 21. Garfinkel and Miller, 2001 : 102-104. 22. ALPERSON and GARFINKEL, 2002 : 174-175 ; MATSKEVICH, 2002 : 180. 23. KERNER, 2001 : 46-61, 79-127. 24. Ibid. : 122.

Lovell's chapter 4 develops a ceramic type series for Ghas- sul and draws comparisons with other Chalcolithic assem- blages. Lovell sees the purpose of the Ghassul ceramic catalogue as threefold : to offer a traditional type series, to study fabric development, and to provide a basis for chemical or pétrographie studies25. To these ends, she emphasizes the importance of listing all contexts in which each type or fabric occurs. Although the catalogue in fact assigns types either to the earliest phase in which it occurs or to the one that exhibits its highest frequency26, the contexts of other occurences are listed. Sherds are assigned to very general (open or closed) and fairly general forms (e.g., bowls, basins, cornets, holemouths), as well as more specific ones, such as V-shaped bowls. The catalogue provides other details, such as fabric class, slip, and decoration, suggesting that comparison of assemblages was based on more finely defined types, but no explicit methods for defining such types or comparing assemblages appears. For example, she cites "bow-rim" necks in phase G, yet no explicit criteria for defining these, while the single example illustrated is incomplete and could as easily be a bowl. There is, instead, a very explicit discussion of Lovell's definition of fabric groups and her interpretation of their change over time27. This potentially very helpful section would have benefited from using time-series or seriation graphs instead of the confusing pie charts in figures 4.59 and 4.60. In any case, the fabrics do not appear to seriate very well, although a few fabrics are much more common in one or two phases than in others. Blackham's approach is to use explicit attribute analysis. He uses paradigmatic classification of sherds based on various attributes of vessel form, rim shape, decoration, and, where applicable, handle shape. He explicitly analyses form in terms of such attributes as wall curvature and angle, neck inflection, and rim shape28. The result is a long list of "main types", and 788 classes in total, accompanied by stylized diagrams of the major form types, handle classes, and categories of impressed and painted decoration29. Consequently, even should we disa- gree with his type definitions, we can see exactly on what he based them. However, not all the types he defines are ulti- mately used in his analysis ; to be included a type has to appear in at least two distinct stratigraphie units ("local horizons"), 25.

One characteristic common to all these volumes is that artifacts, and particularly pottery, are largely decontextual- ized. With the exception of Garfinkel and Miller's occa- sional reference to the spatial context of some finds, such as figurines, relative to architecture, the authors tend to treat artifacts and ecofacts quite separately, and very generally, at the scale of whole levels or whole sites. In other words, there is an underlying assumption not only that all the pot- tery, for example, made at a particular site at a particular time should be similar, but that it should share characteris- tics with other sites in the region occupied at that time. There is little or no discussion, for example, of how human agency - the decisions and strategies of the makers or users of pots - may have led to such patterns. Kerner provides glimpses at how ceramic analysis might lead in this direc- tion in her contrast of household production with specialized production, and particularly in the analysis of gestures involved in making and decorating pots, but she, too, adopts a normative perspective on this contrast. Kafafi, meanwhile, mentions some activities possibly associated with various pits, including one that might represent pottery manufacture and firing30, but there is generally little interaction between the discussion of such features and the description of the objects found in them. CHRONOLOGY In the southern Levant, the period from the end of PPNB to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age arguably has retained more chronological confusion than any other interval in the Holocene, in spite of concerted effort to sort it out31. Not only have radiocarbon dates been rare or unavailable for many of its most important sites and chronocultural units, archaeologists have not even been able to agree completely on their order. The fact that there was probably a fair degree of geographical variation through much of this period only exac- erbates the problem. The new books provide important new radiocarbon evidence, while the three syntheses take three quite different approaches to the chronological debate, some- times with equally divergent results. There is some apparent agreement among these authors in the way they periodize the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic but, as we will see below, this disguises some substantive dis- agreement over what assemblages and even "cultures" belong in these periods : Table 1 : Schematic of gross periodizations of the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic ' as compared with those of Garfinkel and Kafaffi.

In the only example among these books to use an explicit method to assign sites and levels to specific periods, Black- ham uses the Unitary Association Method (UAM) to order a number of assemblages in and near the Jordan Valley. This method is based on set theory and a variety of the "type-fos- sil" approach. Unlike seriation, it is not based on changes in the relative abundance of types over time, but on associated sets of types or attributes whose order can be determined by stratigraphie superposition. Full discussion of this method in an archaeological context can be found in an earlier article, although he also summarizes the method in this volume32. Because the UAM requires assemblages that can be ordered stratigraphically within sites (while allowing some single- period sites), Blackham had to restrict his analysis to sites in this region that satisfied this condition, thus excluding some important sites where there was insufficient information about stratigraphie context or where, as at Munhata, strata were defined on the basis of artifact content33. In addition to using UAM, Blackham also bases the boundaries between major periods on an explicit measure of dissimilarity34. The most glaring disagreements among these periodizations are between Blackham and the others, and centre most noticea- bly on the placement of Wadi Rabah-like assemblages, levels H- D at Tuleilat al-Ghassul, and Abu Hamid' s Middle and Basal levels. Note that Blackham places the Rabah-related assemblage from Tabaqat al-Bûma in his Late Neolithic B, earlier than the latest Ghrubba assemblage, and contemporary with the earlier part of Ghrubba35, while the others place Wadi Rabah, sensu - stricto , in the Early Chalcolithic, where Kerner puts it clearly after Ghrubba. Lovell characterizes level G at Ghassul as influ- enced by Wadi Rabah, citing slips and bow rims as examples of this influence, but considers it to be later than basal Abu Hamid and Ghrubba and approximately contemporary with middle Abu Hamid and Jericho PNB36. Interestingly, Blackham also considers Ghassul G to be closely related to Wadi Rabah, but therefore puts it even earlier than basal Abu Hamid and approx- imately contemporary with the Tabaqat al-Bûma assemblage37. 32.

Paléorient, vol. 28/2, p. 143-156 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2002 151 Kerner likewise places Ghassul G in the Wadi Rabah group, along with Tabaqat al-Bûma, middle Abu Hamid, Jericho PNB, and others, thus taking an approach rather more similar to Lovell's than to Blackham's, but taking Tabaqat al-Bûma into account38. Table 1 implies substantial agreement on the Middle Chal- colithic, but in fact the authors disagree considerably on what assemblages should belong to that period. Blackham places middle Abu Hamid in what he calls the Middle Chalcolithic, post-dating Ghassul F/E, which he calls Early Chalcolithic39. Also in his Middle Chalcolithic are Jiftlik, one level at Mafjar and Tell ash-Shuna North, and most of Abu Habil. Lovell concludes much the opposite, that Ghassul F-D at least begins later than the middle level at Abu Hamid and constitutes a Middle Chalcolithic40. Like Lovell, Kerner includes Ghassul F-D in the Middle Chalcolithic, above the middle level at Abu Hamid, and equates it roughly with Tell Tsaf and Qatif41. All the authors make use of radiocarbon evidence in the attempt to clear up some of the chronological problems, as well as to assign absolute dates. This leads to some puzzling problems with the sequences just mentioned. Lovell lists by far the greatest number of radiocarbon determinations, following Joffe and Dessel in ordering them by their uncalibrated means while showing calibrated values and brief summaries of their context and material42. However, most of this evidence does not appear to have contributed to her chronological conclusions, and much hinges on the appar- ent discrepancies between older Ghassul dates, and a new set of dates from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) that are nearly a millennium younger43. Incidentally, Lovell uses revised phasing for the old dates that differs in some respects from the phasing that Kerner and Blackham use. Lovell cites Temple and Barbetti' s discovery of instru- ment bias of a few centuries for samples run a few years after the Hennessy samples44, but the magnitude of any bias on the early samples here is unknown and probably not nearly large enough to account for the discrepancy. The new ANSTO sam- ples are mainly on short-lived grain, while the older ones were on charcoal that could have been old wood, but this, too, 38. KERNER, 2001 : 52, 54. 39. BLACKHAM, 2002 : 63. 40.

Lovell favours the newer dates, as the statement that the dates "clearly show that the basal levels at Abu Hamid are earlier than the basal levels of Teleilat Ghassul"45, among others, demonstrates. This statement is only true if we accept the new dates and completely ignore the older dates, which strongly suggest that the Ghassul levels from F down precede Abu Hamid. Since she wants the earliest phases at Ghassul to be Late Neolithic, this forces her to place the end of the Late Neolithic as recently as 4,800 cal. ВС, even excluding Wadi Rabah from it, and results in the very late estimate of the Yarmou- kian's date as 5,500 cal. ВС46. Despite the claim that we are "without good radiometric dates for the Yarmoukian phase"47, there is in fact considerable evidence that the Yar- moukian dates ca 6,500-6,000 cal ВС. This evidence includes seven dates from Sha'ar Hagolan, one from 'Ain Rehub, and two from Munhata, all of which precede 6,900 BP and most of which cluster around 7,400-7,300 BP. Most of these dates are widely available48. Furthermore, even though Lovell presents eight of the dates from Tabaqat al-Bûma (Ziqlab 200), and even includes them in two figures, she ignores these dates in the chronolog- ical discussions49. Perhaps this is because she accepts that the Ziqlab assemblages are related to Wadi Rabah, and therefore cannot accept the dates, which would force her to push every- thing from Ghassul G to the Yarmoukian back nearly 1,000 years. Interestingly, the Ziqlab dates, mainly on twig frag- ments, are much more consistent with the old Hennessy dates from Ghassul, while also making sense in terms of the Yar- moukian dates just mentioned. Similarly, her only mention of the Qatif date presented is to dismiss Goren's claim for a relationship between Qatif and the lowest levels at Ghassul50. In contrast with people who consider Qatif to be post- Wadi Rabah, Lovell would account for its date by considering it contemporary with basal Abu Hamid and Jericho PNA, and for its dissimilarity to those assemblages by regional variation51. 45.

COLLOQUE ET RECENSIONS Overall, the problems here result from assigning assem- blages to periods on the basis of a selection of radiocarbon dates, rather than analysing the radiocarbon dates carefully in the light of the stratigraphie and typological evidence, although elsewhere Lovell' s use of this evidence is more sophisticated52. Kerner's use of radiocarbon dates is distributed among her discussion of other chronological issues. In spite of her broad agreement with Lovell on many of these issues, she has no trouble placing the earliest dates from Ziqlab along with those from several Yarmoukian sites around 6,000 cal. ВС, whether or not they fit unambiguously in this period, or in associating the later Ziqlab dates with Hennessy' s dates from Ghassul F-G and dates from what she would describe as Early Chalcolithic assemblages at Tsaf, Wadi Feinan, and elsewhere53. Like Lovell, she notes the possible instrumental error on the Ghassul dates in a footnote, but it is also neces- sary to mention a small error in the citation of the Ghassul dates, the fact that their assignment to phases differs from those of Lovell, and the fact that she groups some dates chronologically instead of stratigraphically. For example, the determination of 6,900 ± 70 that she assumes comes from phase 2 at Tabaqat al-Bûma is actually from phase 3 and probably residual54. Consequently, it should appear in a dif- ferent table on p. 56, while other dates that properly pertain to phases 2 and 3 do not appear at all. Kerner's use of dates is consistent with her placement of Qatif after Wadi Rabah, following Goren. Like Blackham, she is unaware of the more recent dates for Ghassul. Blackham considers the radiocarbon evidence only after having constructed a sequence with UAM. He then examines all the radiocarbon dates that were available to him from his selection of sites with the aim of checking on their consist- ency with the phasing as well as with each other. To do this he uses Bayesian analysis of the calibrated date distributions with the help of the OxCal software55. This allows modelling the presumed stratigraphie relationships between contexts and taking this model into account in the analysis of the calibrated dates. It also provides a basis for establishing which dates are "outliers" - ones that do not at all agree with the rest of the evidence - other than our gut preconceptions. The ultimate results56 seem very plausible, even though they rely on Ghas- 52. Lovell, 2002. 53. KERNER, 2001 : 48-49, 56. 54. BLACKHAM, 1997 : 357-358. 55.

Although the models took individual sites' stratigraphie order, where known, into account, they did not use the UAM results, and so provide an independent check on them. Overall, the consistency between the UAM chronol- ogy and the resulting radiocarbon chronology is very good. Certainly, none of these authors has solved all the chrono- logical problems that the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic present, and all would agree that many more radiocarbon dates are needed. In spite of the disagreements between their chronological models, however, they have succeeded in high- lighting where problems remain and suggest ways we may eventually resolve them. SOCIO-POLITICAL COMPLEXITY Several of the authors augment the discussion of socio- political complexity in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic through their analysis of spatial organization, organization of produc- tion, and regional interaction. Garfinkel and Miller provide very exciting evidence for and discussion of the domestic architecture and the spatial organization of finds at Sha'ar Hagolan. Most of the architec- tural evidence appears in chapters by Garfinkel and David Ben-Shlomo, and concentrates on two complexes of rooms, each built around a large courtyard and separated from its neighbours by narrow streets and alleys. They adopt a typo- logical and explicitly evolutionary approach to these build- ings in the context of Near Eastern architecture more generally, thus following in the tradition of Olivier Aurenche58. They classify the Sha'ar Hagolan complexes as among the earliest examples of the Near Eastern "courtyard house" but, although they appear to recognize that adoption of this domestic pattern had implications for the site occupants' daily activities59, do not take as much advantage of their evi- dence for use of space in these units as they might. They do comment on differences between two complexes in the distri- 56. BLACKHAM, 2002 : 85-88. 57. Note that newer Lyon dates from Abu Hamid would require this date to move up somewhat, see LOVELL, 2002 : 94-95. 58. Aurenche, 1981. 59. GARFINKEL and BEN-SHLOMO, 2002 : 78. Paléorient, vol. 28/2, p. 143-156 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2002 153 butions of figurines and decorated pottery that could signal "intensive social activities" in complex II60. However, I think other researchers have much to gain from mining this report for other evidence of this kind. Garfinkel' s concluding chapter presents the view that Sha'ar Hagolan's large size, large courtyard structures, and apparent street networks are evidence that scalar stress led to a need for social reorganization, replacing a two-level hierar- chy associated with kinship-based organization in "open set- tlements" with a three-level hierarchy associated with extended families and "condensed, closed settlement"61. He notes that Sha'ar Hagolan's structures with enclosed court- yards would have fundamentally changed the organization of household activities, while the distribution of storage rooms and exotic items has implications for the accumulation of household wealth and for the redistribution of goods. It is worth noting that others have discussed these sorts of archi- tectural associations in other contexts ; for example, Garfin- kel' s "open settlements" correspond with Hillier and Hanson's "zj syntax" while the "condensed closed settle- ment" is their "z5 syntax"62. Although Garfinkel is clearly onto some of the relevant factors and correctly recognizes that these changes in domestic arrangements must have been asso- ciated with social change, his working hypothesis that "open" settlements correspond with two-level while courtyard struc- tures are associated with three-level decision-making hierar- chies seems simplistic. One should also be careful of inferring planned settlement on the basis of small segments of streets ; street systems are common to thousands of unplanned, ver- nacular settlements in the ethnographic record and it is too soon to see if Sha'ar Hagolan's street network is sufficiently regular to indicate community-level planning. No doubt his continued analysis of the interplay between architectural evi- dence and the types of evidence he mentions in the following pages will eventually lead to more robust conclusions about how Sha'ar Hagolan's inhabitants organized their daily affairs and structured their social encounters. Kerner also discusses architectural evidence, but provides particularly intensive discussion of the role of specialization in the production of goods, including pottery and metal, in workings of Chalcolithic socio-political organization. She sees evidence for increasing standardization and specializa- tion over the period, including general decreases in the 60.

Hillier and Hanson, 1984 : 78.</page><page sequence="7">154 number of procedures needed to make pots, such as V-shaped bowls, and amount of effort invested in pottery decoration. In the last chapters of the book, she attempts to relate these changes in specialization to social evolution, having rejected most of the older models that focus on such features as redis- tribution and warfare. She sees chiefdoms as marked by heightened management of labour, land, and resources, and argues that larger social units were able to take advantage of varying economic conditions to even out resource shortages through increased productivity. She notes that, although the evidence from cemeteries, prestige goods and architecture shows many discrepancies from what the literature would lead us to expect of chiefdoms, the Chalcolithic still shows considerable social differentiation and complexity. Blackham takes the interesting approach of studying social complexity in the Chalcolithic through explicit meas- ures of interaction, diversity, and innovation63. For example, he guages the extent to which change over time is endogenous by comparing consecutive time zones in terms of type disap- pearances, type introductions, and similarity coefficients. As we might, perhaps, expect, this shows the greatest disruption in ceramic tradition at the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze bound- ary. Meanwhile, the amount of diversity in each time zone indicates the degree to which the Jordan Valley shared culture ; presumably less interaction between populations usually leads to greater diversity. Furthermore, measures of inter-site connectedness from network analysis provide a more explicit measure of regional interaction, showing in this case that his Late Neolithic sites were highly interconnected. The Chalcolithic, in his view, begins as a period of weakened interaction, when many earlier pottery forms were discontin- ued. By the late Chalcolithic, ceramic styles were more stand- ardized, many older styles were discontinued, but there was actually relatively little regional interaction. These conclu- sions have important implications for the nature of Chalcol- ithic social systems at the regional level. Furthermore, Blackham's detection of a sharp break in continuity and high levels of innovation at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age leads him to conclude "that drastic social change occurred. . . [that] argues against local factors as the root of change"64, rather than such alternatives as economic changes65. Overall, I concur with Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo that our growing knowledge of the first part of the period with which 63. Blackham, 2002 : 89-102. 64. Ibid. : 100. 65. LOVELL, 2002. COLLOQUE ET RECENSIONS these books deal, far from indicating "a period of regression and decline in settlement organization", points to considera- ble elaboration66. Meanwhile, Blackham and Kerner, in par- ticular, emphasize important socio-political developments in the Late Chalcolithic and their possible relationship to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age.
