<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR by J. A. BIERENS DE HAAN (Amsterdam) (Received Io. VIII. 1946) The foundation of a new Journal, bearing the name: "Behaviour" (where, for convenience' sake, the word "Animal" has been left out), may be regarded as a choice opportunity to expound once again what separates the so-called "objectivist" in this field study from the real animal-psychologist, and what unites them. In his little book: "Psychology, the Study of Behaviour", published in 19I2, MCDOUGALL once defined (human) psychology as "the positive science of the behaviour of living things", in which by "behaviour" he understood "the purposive bodily activities in which the mental processus of men and animals find expression". But eleven years later, in his "Outline of Psychology" (I923) he had to renounce this definition. The reason of this change was not that he regarded his former definition as wrong or unsufficient. On the contrary, he still regarded it as good, logically perhaps the best. But since he gave this definition of psychology it had been adopted and carried to an extreme by a group of psychologists who called themselves i"the Behaviorists". "In protesting against a too exclusive study of intro- spective data, and rightly insisting on the importance of the study of behavior as a psychological method, they have overshot the mark and swung intO the untenable position noticed above. Hence I am disposed to say: If yrou are going to get on, it's time for me to get off" (MCDOUGALL, I923, p. 38). He then defined psychology as "the positive and empirical science of the human mind", a definition he had regarded as unsatisfactory in his previous book. It is not quite clear why McDoUGALL returned to this definition he had once rightly called unsatisfactory himself. For, as he had then pointed out, the "sciences of the mind" embrace some sciences which have little if</page><page sequence="2">72 J. A. BIERENS DE HAAN anything to do with psychology, as for instance logic and perhaps even mathematics. And for the rest the concept of mind itself is, as he termed it, "an extremely ill-defined object". We may, anyhow, give a much better definition of what psychology as a science really is. This is, then: the science of psychic realities or of psychic phenomena. What these psychic phenomena are, we know best in ourselves. They are phenomena of quite different nature than those we observe in the world around us. They' are immaterial, and, although they may be said to occur "'in us", they cannot be located anywhere in our body, as are the physiological processes in it. They are, in short, our sensations and perceptions, our feelings and desires, our memories and reflections, and many other phenomena of a kindred nature. These phenomena have two essential characteristics. TI'he first of these is, that they form our most direct and best knowledge. My own perception of a tree is something I know much more directly and much better than I know the tree itself; my feelings of love or hatred towards some people I know much more directly than I know those persons; my memories of war-time events I know much better than these events themselves. The other characteristic is, that we know such psychic phenomena only directly in ourselves, while those of other people are only indirectly knowable to us, viz. only in so far as those other people communicate them to us, either in a direct or indirect way. These phenomena, further, do not have an independent existence, as may be said of the trees in our garden or the animals in the world around us, but are bound to ourselves or some other man as a living subject, for which reason they are also called "subjective phenomena". These psychic or subjective phenomena, now, are the object of human psychology as a science. How can we study them? The first way is that of introspection, i.e. that of looking into one's own self and realizing what one experiences at a given moment and under given circumstances. This is the most direct, be it limited, way of studying human psychology. For a science, built merely on the inner experiences of one person, of course, would have but a rather restricted value. To build up a real science of psychology we require the help of other persons more or less different from ourselves. We can get this help in two ways. First we can-obtain active help, if such persons communicate to us their inner experiences in special circumstances, so that we may compare them wit-h our own. But these other people are, not always willing, or even able, to communicate their inner experiences. Here we are thinking especially of young children, of the mentally'diseased, of persons of primitive human races. In these cases we try to help our- selves in a different way. We then observe and study their behaviour, that</page><page sequence="3">ANIMAL PSYCHOIOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 73 is, to quote McDOUGALL again, "the Dodily activities in which mental pro- cesses find expression". From the observation of this behaviour, made under diffferent and sometimes experimental conditions, we obtain our know- ledge regarding the mental or psychic phenomena that underlie it. And in so far as the emphasis of the psychologist is laid on this last mentioned method of studying subjective phenomena, he is entitled to call his science "the science of behaviour", the word behaviour again taken in the s,ense given to it by McDoUGALL. But then he must realize that, in doing so, he does not so much denote the object of his science, as its method. But it is not on human psychology that we wish to speak here, but on the psychology of animals. It will be clear that where we defined human psychology as the science of psychic phenomena in man, animal psychology must be that of psychic phenomena in the animals. This science, now is a very old one. If setting aside the earliest popular and uncritical informa- tions on psychic phenomena in animals to be found in old folk-lore and religious creeds, we may say that it was ARISTOTLE who gave animal psychology a scientific standing. His standpoint, as expressed in his "Historia animalium", is remarkably modern, and quite acceptable to the animal psychologist of our days. He declared that the animals perceive, and form images, as is proved by the fact that they dream, that they possess memory and the capacity of learning, that they know feelings of pleasure and pain, of desire and aversion, but that they are not capable of deliberation and rational thinking, although in some cases they show practical intelligence. It must be regretted that ARISTOTLE'S ideas about the structure of the animal mind have not always been adhered to in the course of time. After ARlSTOTLE the views respecting the nature of the animal psyche diverged in two directions. There is one line of evolution of thought, running through the Stoic philosophers, the scholasticism of the Middle Ages, DESCARTES and the modern mechanists, which leads to an essential difference between the human and animal psyche, and finally even to a negation of psychic phenomena in animals; an other line runs through the Epicureans, PLU- TARCHUS, MONTAIGNE and the evolutionists of DARWIN'S time, to an anthropomorphizing of the animal and an over-estimation of its psychic capacities. That we reject both these extreme conceptions may be said by the way. And then, at the close of last century, there arose a new trend of thought, that of the scepticists, or "objectivists", as they called them- selves. The first objectivistic movement arose in Germany, when in I899 BEER, BETHE and VON UEXKULL published a manifesto in which they tried to clear the sense-physiology of man and the animals of all expressions which</page><page sequence="4">74 J. A. BIERENS DE HAAN were tinged with subjective meaning, since, in their opinion, subjective phenomena are only knowable in ourselves, whereas in other beings, be it in other men or in the animals, such phenomena were known only by analogy. To this end they invented a new vocabulary, spoke of "receptors" instead of sense-organs, of "receptions" instead of sensations, of "icono- receptions" instead of perceptions, and the like. This new vocabulary, of course, was rather a sterile undertaking; it is not the name but the purport of a concept that matters. It must be borne in mind, however, that it was not their intention to deny psychic phenomena in other beings, even not in animals. This was clearly expressed by VON UEXKfUL (I9oo) when he wrote: "Wir leisten Verzicht darauf, aus den sichtbaren Handlungen der Tiere auf die Vorgange in ihrer Psyche zu schliessen". They therefore did not go so far as DESCARTES, for instance, did, who in his "Discours de la Methode" denied all psychic phenomena in animals, regarding them as ingeniously built machines, suited to the purpose for which they were con- structed. Only they lacked the courage to inquire after these phenomena, the existence of which they did not doubt. For the rest the influence of this German objectivism has never been very great. Most of the adherents reverted to pure physiology. VON UEXKeLL from his stanidpoint later built up his "Umweltlehre", an interest- ing objective doctrine of animal behaviour, which, however, does not con- cern us here. LORENZ who found a certain favour among the younger Ger- man biologists before the war, but whose immature and rather confused ideas I critisized on another occasion (I942), may be regarded as more or less a follower of VON UEXKfULL. More influential was an objectivism of American origin, the well known "Behaviorism", first expounded by WATSON in a manifesto of I913. This Behaviorism still controls the views of the greater number of the Anglo- Saxon students of animal behaviour and for some time past has begun to influence also the ideas of workers on the Continent. That I cannot regard this as an advance, I hope to make clear in the following pages. First of all, however, it must be stated that there are several different tendencies and gradations among those modern Behaviorists. The Be- haviorism of WATSON was, or rather became, ever more mechanistic and simplistic, not to say the word naive. Of quite a different nature is the "Purposive Behaviorism" of TOLMAN (I932), who oscillates between the Behaviorism of WATSON on the one hand and the Purposivism of McDou- GALL on the other, and seeks to mask his uncertainty under a system of newly coined rather vague and incomprehensible technical terms, which confuse the reader more than they help him. Again more distinct from</page><page sequence="5">ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 7 5 WATSON'S is the "Hormic Behaviourism" of RUSSELL (1938), which comes nearest to McDoUGALL'S psychology. But they all agree in so far as they acknowledge as the object of their science only what is objectively know- able, i.e. the stimulus that acts upon an animal, and its objectively knowable reaction, i.e. its behaviour. What is their reason for taking such an objectivistic standpoint? There may be two logical reasons to do so, and to accept objectivism as the only or best solution of the problem of animal psychology. The first is the doubt whether such subjective phenomena as we know in ourselves do really occur in animals. As far as I can see but few objectivists go so far as that; only WATSON in his later books seems more or less to deny psychical phenomena in aflimals. I go farther, and believe it can be proved that such phenomena really exist in all animals. This I did on a former occasion (I935), and hope before long to do so again (I947), so that it is not necessary to do it here. The other, more important, reason is that the objectivists seem to doubt whether it is possible to know these inner experiences in animals, or to know them sufficiently enough to build up a science on them. As I believe this to be the cardinal point, it is worth while devoting a few words to this question. We have already seen that we know the subjective phenomena only in ourselves, and know them in other beings only in so far as they are directly or indirectly communicated to us. This first way is that of verbal com- munication. That this method is precluded when we have to do with animals requires no further elucidation. The indirect method is, as we said before, that, that we cause the man we wish to study to do something, that we let him behave, often without his being awaire that we are observing his behaviour. From this observed behaviour, then, we deduce what moves him at a given moment. We can not deny that there is some uncertainty in this deducing of an other man's inner experiences from his observed behaviour. First of all, we may doubt if that man possesses such inner experiences at all. He may be a robot, or an ingeniously built machine, just as DESCARTES thought the animals were. I concede of course that no sane mind will adopt this view; nevertheless a psychological solipsism, an ignoring of other men's mental life in building up a human psychology, logically is quite defensible. But apart from this: can we come, and how do we come, to the knowledge of another man's inner experiences, by merely observing what he does or does not do? There is a faculty of the human mind which enables us to accomplish this to a certain degree. That is what may be called the faculty of s y m-</page><page sequence="6">76 J. A. BIERENS DE HAAN p a t h e t i c in t u i t i o n. It is not the place here to enter deeper in the psychological question as to what this intuition is and how it works. We may leave this to the students of human psychology. But as a matter of fact every one of us possesses more or less this gift of insight into another man's mind and uses this ability in his daily intercourse with his fellow- men. One may be a "good psychologist" or a bad one, but in a certain way everyone is such a psychologist his whole life. He judges another man from the expression of his face, from the way he answers or shakes hands, from his bearing and his hand-writing, even if he does not say anything about himself. He knows that another man dislikes him and tries to thwart him, even if he comes to him with kind words ion his lips and a friendly demeanour. And, more important yet, he knows that this is not a supposition, but a sure and certain knowledge. And even the young child, when it sees its mother smiling kindly at it, knows the friendly feeling of the mother, and smiles back at her, even when it has never had the occasion to see its own smiling face in a mirror, and therefore cannot judge its mother's feelings by a comparison of the expression of her smiling face with its own in friendly mood. This fact proves once more that it is not by analogy with our own expressions that we deduce the inner experiences of other people, as has often been asserted, It may be that afterwards such an analogy between their expressions and our own may help us in understanding our neighbour; essentially this understanding comes about in quite a different way. But let us return to the animals. We know, then, that they all have their inner experiences, their subjective phenomena, and as students of animal psychology we desire to know them. For this a conclusion by analogy cannot help us; the expressions of animals differ too much from our own. But here again the sympathetic intuition comes to our assistance. And here again it is a faculty we use in our daily intercourse with animals. The man who whistles in vain for his dog and says: ,,He hears me very well, but he won't come, and tries to keep away from me, because he is afraid I will beat him", expresses his knowledge about the auditive perceptions as welt as about the feelings and the striving of his dog. And he does not say this by way of supposition, but as knowledge he is sure about. And he is quite right in his knowledge. And the man who is annoyed by wasps round his tea-table in the garden says: "They come here because they know there is something for them here at this hour". He may be wrong in his conclusion, but yet he expresses his knowledge respecting the inner ex- periences of the wasps with certainty. There exists, therefore, certainly something like an intuitive knowledge of the animal's mind. Should this</page><page sequence="7">ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 77 faculty suddenly fail the student of animal behaviour when he enters his laboratory or lecture-room? The question may be asked therefore, what may be the psychological reason why sia many students of animal behaviour cling to this objectivism and deliberately refuse to go a step further and try to penetrate into the psychic life of the animals the behaviour of whom they are studying. They cannot ignore the fact that, if such inner experiences do exist in animals, these must certainly influence their behaviour. Several psychological ex- planations may be found for the objectivist's attitude. The first is that the layman often arrives rather too easily at an explanation of the be- haviour of animals in psychological terms, and is somewhat too sure about facts of which the student feels the uncertainty. A tendency to keep aloof from the layman's beliefs and ideas is a not uncommon attitude of students of many branches of science. Then, there is a certain modesty among stu- dents with only biological training, who do not feel sufficiently grounded in psychological methodology, and in their fear to err prefer to avoid this dangerous field altogether. A more important reason for their clinging to objective descriptions, rather than entering into psychological interpreta- tions, seems to me to be the confusion between two different meanings of the word "objective". The first is that which we have used up till now in this paper: a confining of oneself to what is objectively knowable in the behaviour of an animal and an ignoring of its subjective or inner life. The second meaning of the word is the one more generally known: that of adopting an impartial or neutral point of view, in contrast to a subjective one, i.e. one which is cumbered with' personal partialities and prejudices. Now, in science every man naturally endeavours to take such an objective standpoint and to reject all subjectivism, taken in the second sense of the word. And then the virtue and dignity of "objectivism" in the second sense of the word radiates upon objectivism in the first sense, and lead many students to believe that they attain a higher scientific standard when they assume an objectivistic attitude in the first sense of the word. That -this is a fallacy and that there may be an uncritical and biassed objectivism as well as subjectivism in the interpretation of animal behaviour, will be clear. But the most potent reason why so many students of animal behaviour keep to objective descriptions instead of trying to penetrate into the psychic ife of their animals, seems to me to be an after-effect of the old 19-century idea, which regarded physics and chemistry as the crown of natural sciences, and biology, not to speak of psychology, only as second-rate science, not on a par with physics and chemistry as to exactitude and scientific level, so</page><page sequence="8">78 J. A. BIERENS DE HAAN that biologists could not better do than to allow their science to resemble as much as possible that of inanimated nature. This idea finds its origin in the positivism of AUGUSTE COMTE, who claimed that all biological laws should be reduced to physical laws. This view has happily been rejected by modern biologists, especially by the Holists, like HALDANE and ADOLF MEYER, who on the contrary regard physical phenomena and laws as simplifications of the biological phenomena and laws. This is, of course, not the place to enter deeper into this question, which is of primary im- portance for any biologist who has regard for the place taken by his science in the system of sciences. But it might, anyhow, cure the student of animal behaviour of a kind of minority-complex that makes him adopt a too sub- missive attitude towards physics and chemistry and sciences which, like physiology, aim at reducing the functions of the animal body to physical and chemical phenomena. If TINBERGEN (I942) goes so far as to state as the ultimate goal of the student of animal behaviour the analysis of this behaviour into terms of muscle contractiohs, if FRAENKEL and GUNN (1940) even go so far as to aim at describing animal behaviour in the fundamental terms of physics and chemistry, we certainly may doubt if these ideals will ever be reached and if a full and adequate description of the behaviour in such terms will ever be possible. Moreover we believe that they are seeking their way in a wrong direction, when as their scientific ideal they claim to explain behaviour in phenomena only indirectly knowable to us (the phenomena of inanimated nature) instead of in phenomena such as we directly know into ourselves (the subjective ones). And this the more so as, in doing so, they will wholly ignore factors which are of preponderant importance to the understanding of this behaviour. For the rest, the attitude of many of the objectivists is curiously in- consistent. As they themselves feel, that an explanation in objective terms never will wholly be possible, they help themselves by smuggling in their descriptions terms with a subjective meaning, subjoining, by way of excuse, that they use them "in an objective sense only". For instance, they will use the word "'Stimmung" or "mood". This word, as everyone knows, describes a certain complex of emotional states or feelings. Yet for TINBERGEN (I942) it does not mean more than "a convenient descriptive term to denote the physiologi,cal condition of the animal". Why then use this word, which can only give rise to confusion? The same holds good for words like "striving` and "satisfaction" as used by the same author. And when he calls in the help of a "configurational stimulus" or "Gestalt-stimulus", the author over- looks the fact that it is only in the mind of the subject that such a "Gestalt"' is built up of a multitude of stimulating elements, and that a "Gestalt" itself</page><page sequence="9">ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF ANIMIAL BEHAVIOUR 79 has no objective existence. The assuming of a "Gestalt" presupposes an active mind which builds and perceives it. A consistent objectivist, therefore, must reject, or ignore, the existence of "Gestalts", just as he denies, or at least ignores, subjective phenomena in his animals. Sometimes, when using such terms with a subjective meaning, the objectivist is honest enough to own up to the inadequacy of his theoretical attitude, when confessing, as did NISSEN and CRAWFORD (1936) when using words like "unhappiness", "friendship", "sympathy" and such-like in their description of the be- haviour of chimpanzees: "We shall conserve time and space by employing anthropomorphic terms (without quotation marks) when these permit briefer or more adequate description than would available objective termino- logy". Whether words like "friendship" and "unhappiness" can ever ade- quately be described in objective terms may certainly be doubted. We, therefore, reject objectivism in its different forms, as an inadequate way of explaining animal behaviour. There is more in the animal's world than stimuli in his surroundings and movements of his limbs. And as we know this, we also wish to know what it is that goes on in his mind. Finally, there is one more point of which many of the objectivists are especially proud. Their science is an "analytical" one, whereas animal psychology is merely "descriptive" or "contemplative". Now, first of all, the value of analysis in such pronouncements is much overestimated. It is overlooked that analysis may never be more than a means, and can never be an end in itself. What is the use of analysis if it does not lead to synthesis ? It is finally only synthesis which counts in science. And synthetical con- siderations do not always need a previous analysis, but may be reached in a more direct way. If one will call this "descriptive", I readily accept this term. For the rest it is often forgotten, that analysis, and even causal analysis, does not exist on the mechanic level alone. There is a psychological analysis and a psychological causality, quite apart from a mechanical or physiological one. If in my study of the behaviour of an animal I come to the conclusion that its striving is evoked by special feelings, which, in their turn, are re- leased by special perceptions, 1 have given a psychological analysis of the inner experiences of the animal and the same time I have shown a psycholo- gical causal relation between several of its subjective experiences. Of course the more philosophically grounded among the objectivists know all this very well, but among the younger students there often exists a certain confusion on this point. So far I have mainly stressed what separates the objectivist from the real animal psychologist. Let me may end by saying what unites them. What unites them, it will be clear, is the careful observation of animal</page><page sequence="10">SO BIERENS DE IIAAN. ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY behaviour, be it under natural or experimental conditions. In so far both go hand in hand. If, then, the obj)ectivist thinks he has done enough by describing his observations and their analysis in terms of what is objectively knowable, let him stop there. Only do not let him believe he has the right to call this work "psychology", as is sometimes done. On the other hand, the psychologist will accept the results of the objectivist's study with a grateful heart, as material from which to conclude, what goes on in the animal's mind. And so the animal psychologist will welcome the appearance of a journal, bearing the name of "Behaviour", in the knowledge that this journal will cover the field in which he meets the objectivist, and expecting in his heart that sooner or later this objectivistic vogue will abate, and give rise to a renewed revival of a sound and straightforward animal psychology.
