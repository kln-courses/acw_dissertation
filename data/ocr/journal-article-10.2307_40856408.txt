<plain_text><page sequence="1">Malcah Effron On the Borders of the Page, on the Borders of Genre: Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction While the footnote in fiction has been explored in relation to specific agendas in different historical eras,1 in relation to generic use, it has primarily been exam- ined as prefiguring or as one of the tropes of postmodernism. By examining the footnote in fiction in relation to issues of genre, we can explore the correlative sta- bility between the boundaries of the page and the boundaries of generic form. In the detective fiction genre, and particularly in the Golden Age clue-puzzle,2 the foot- note in fiction specifically questions the role of genre in defining the boundaries be- tween our appreciation of reality and fiction, as can particularly be seen in the works of pseudonymous detective novelists S. S. Van Dine, Carter Dickson, and Ed- mund Crispin. The pseudonymous authorship of these detective series calls atten- tion not only to the notes' role in the fiction but also to the role of pseudonyms as fictional creations. Whereas in late twentieth-century literature attention to textual- ity is often assumed to undermine the realistic narrative frame, in the Golden Age detective novels the footnotes in the fiction reveal that acknowledged textuality can establish the realistic narrative frame while the notion of genre undermines it. Golden Age detective fiction is generally recognized for its clue-puzzle struc- ture, particularly as popular Golden Age authors like Van Dine propose that the de- tective novel is "a complicated and extended puzzle cast in fictional form" ("Detective Story" 5).3 Because the form foregrounds the puzzle element, the genre has developed rules of "fair play" that are meant to enable the reader equal oppor- Malcah Effron is a final year doctoral student at Newcastle University, England.

Seemingly for this reason, several Golden Age detective writers use foot- notes and other paratextual forms in their novels to indicate extratextual authority for their clues in their novels, even though detective novels are not generally known for using paratexts. For instance, Carter Dickson uses footnotes in The Reader is Warned to cite source material like "Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, Seventh Edition, 1920" (67n). However, in some significant cases, the footnotes extend beyond simple citation into narratorial participation, such as when a narrator paratextually indicates that he "sent a proof of the following para- graphs to [Philo] Vance [the detective protagonist], and [the detective] edited and corrected them; so that, as they now stand, they represent his theories in practically his own words" (Van Dine, Canary 150n) or when a character confirms that he is "looking over [the] notes of this case" (Dickson 127n). In slipping from the wholly referential to the narratorial, these footnotes also slip between paratexts and artifi- cial paratexts, where artificial paratexts are those that do not simply surround the fictional narrative but are part of it. In this slippage between paratexts and artificial paratexts, the narratives strive to convince not only that the pieces that comprise the puzzle are real, as in the case of the references, but also that the composite narrative is real, for these artificial paratexts serve as reality effect since the characters tran- scend the border of the page into the paratextual material. While these slippages thus generate a reality effect, they simultaneously reveal that the characters inhabit the space both within and without the narrative frame and, as seen in the previous quote from Dickson, that they are conscious of the generic constructs of the forms in which they participate and to which they are ex- pected to conform. In this regard, these artificial paratexts not only participate in the reality effect by mimetically reproducing nonfictional forms, but also they also gen- erate a metafiction, as they "consistently [lay] bare its condition of artifice" (Waugh 4), since they call attention to the narrative constructs in which they participate. The metafictionality of these artificial paratexts becomes particularly clear as the pseu- donymous authors appear as characters within the text as well as figures on the title page. As such, these paratexts seem to allow the authors to cross into the narrative as well as the characters to cross out of it, blurring the boundary not only between textual and paratextual but also between real and fictional. Through this confusion, these narratives not only interrogate the function of artificial paratexts, but they also suggest that a pseudonym is yet another artificial paratext. The artificial paratexts in Golden Age detective fiction thus expose that the narrative devices that generate a reality effect can, in fact, be the same devices that create metafictive effects in a manner that does not disrupt the mimesis but rather coexists with it. THE FOOTNOTE IN FICTION In reading footnotes in fiction from different historical periods, Shari Benstock argues that these footnotes indicate that "they belong to a fictional universe, stem from a creative act rather than a critical one, and direct themselves toward the fie-</page><page sequence="3">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 201 tion, and never toward an external construct, even when they cite 'real' works in the world outside the particular fiction" (205). In this passage, Benstock reads the foot- notes not as violating the margins of the text, but as expanding the boundaries of the text into the margins of the page. Edward Maloney and Craig Dworkin share this approach in their readings of postmodern texts. Maloney particularly focuses on the note as participant in what GÃ©rard Genette calls the "enunciative regime" (332) rather than a break in it, and Dworkin analyzes how the notes usurp the position of the body of the text to become the body (1). This trajectory focuses on the metafic- tionality that the footnotes create, indicating that "[f]ootnotes in a literary work highlight the interplay between author and subject . . . giving us occasion to specu- late on self-reflective narration as an aspect of textual authority" (Benstock 205). The detective genre in particular depends on the acceptance of textual authority to create both the puzzle and the solution that form the underlying generic format, and, as will be shown, the self-reflective comments presented in the footnotes in these fictions simultaneously underscore and undermine this textual authority. However, unlike in non-generically classified texts, the footnotes in detective fiction overtly work to underscore rather than undermine textual authority, and their ability to undermine derives more directly from the speculation they invoke. While critics like those discussed above focus their analyses on texts that might better be classified as experimental rather than popular, Robert Mayer ad- dresses the issue of generic influence on the footnotes in popular fiction when he ac- knowledges that in Sir Walter Scott's writing, some footnotes "[seek] to authenticate the narrative through the provision of information that both supple- ments and offers evidence . . . and reassure readers that apparently fantastic parts of the narrative are in fact true" (916). Mayer suggests that the text's generic classifi- cation as a romance generates this need for the authenticating note, claiming that the romance in the early nineteenth century was not expected to present reality. He also notes that the generic status of the romance also works to undermine the au- thenticating role of the notes, as the fictional status of the genre "invites the reader to view the attached apparatus as itself fictional" (921). As the reader is invited to read the notes as fictional particularly because of the genre in which they partici- pate, we can draw the same conclusions about the footnotes that appear in detective fiction. Nevertheless, Mayer's analysis is still rooted in questions of presentation in relation to the historical era in which Scott's romances appear, and the texts he stud- ies have achieved an academic standing despite their genre rather than because of it. By turning to twentieth-century detective fiction to examine the importance of genre on the work of footnotes in fiction, we examine texts that have not of them- selves transcended their generic categories and thus raise the question more clearly about the inclusion of paratextual material in narratives structured generically. ARTIFICIAL PARATEXTS While many have analyzed the historical function of the footnote in relation to its literary significance, Genette is fascinated by the textual nature of footnotes, as</page><page sequence="4">202 Malcah Effron he claims that "if the paratext is an often indefinite fringe between text and off-text, the note which, depending on type, belongs to one or the other or lies between the two - perfectly illustrates this indefiniteness and this slipperiness" (343). For Genette, the footnote's interest lies in its explicit marginality, which places it nei- ther wholly inside nor wholly outside the narrative frame of the text, creating its po- sition of "indefiniteness and . . . slipperiness" (343). Edward Maloney agrees with Genette's analysis of this slipperiness, particularly in relation to footnotes that par- ticipate in the fictional frame of the narrative. Maloney terms these fictional foot- notes artificial or fictional paratexts,4 indicating that artificial paratexts "play with the boundaries of fiction and non-fiction [creating] this effect of confusion about the fictional status of the narrative . . . which lends the story a sense of verisimilitude" (1-2). Maloney 's notion of "verisimilitude" (2) - a concept Genette refers to as "plausible" (342) - implies that these footnotes seem to participate in Roland Barthes's reality effect. Because of the assumed primacy of the puzzle in the British whodunit, the term plausible might seem to connote logical coherence when we discuss detective fiction. However, when we consider Maloney's appropriation of Genette's language and focus on paratexts in detective fiction, we find a correlation between Genette's "plausible" (342) and Maloney's "verisimilar" (2) that leads us to a second inter- pretation of plausibility in the detective novel. This interpretation emphasizes the narrative component of the story, making it important that the narrative is believable as a story and not simply as a riddle or puzzle. The footnotes help create the sense of the story as recounted events, rather than as a mental exercise, because they sug- gest that the narrative's existence extends beyond the bounds of the generic text. As critics like Benstock, Dworkin, and Maloney suggest, the footnotes call at- tention to the textuality of the narrative, and in emphasizing the position of text as an object, they also combine the position of the read and the position of the reader within the fictional construct. By highlighting the narrative's textuality, the foot- notes identify the physical body of the narrative as a material item for the reader's consumption. However, these notes also firmly position a reader within the text, es- pecially when they are signed by either the author or a character. In these cases, the notes convey that the body of the text has been read and annotated by the signa- tory - or, in Genette's terminology, the sender - of the note. For the novels to high- light the positions of the read and the reader, they rely on the second-order observer position of the extratextual reader.5 The reader's extratextual, and hence second- order, position allows him or her to recognize the metafictionality implicit in the footnotes' work of calling attention to the text as text. The relation of the extratex- tual to the textual embeds the footnotes in the fiction that they annotate and hence emphasizes the fiction of the text to which they refer. For critics of recognized metafiction like Dworkin and Maloney, the empha- sized textuality calls attention to the fictionality because it calls attention to the nar- rative as text. Furthermore, the physicality of the text identifies it as a creation rather than as a realization. However, for non-canonical texts - and particularly for popular genres like detective fiction - the generic tropes predetermine the texts, so that critics have generally argued that detective novels are not expected to be realis-</page><page sequence="5">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 203 tic. As Geoffrey Hartman suggests, "a voracious formalism dooms [the detective novel] to seem unreal, however 'real' the world it describes" (225). Because critics read this "voracious formalism" to imply that detective fiction is always read as consciously textual, the detective novel inverts the position of the metafictional novel where the extratextual reader begins with the assumption of realism until it is disproved. Instead, the detective genre needs to establish itself as believably realis- tic. So while the artificial paratexts in detective fiction underscore the textuality of the narrative as is done in metafictional artificial paratexts, in general these artificial paratexts emphasize this textuality to establish - rather than to destroy - mimetic reality. As the footnotes are able to cross the border between the narrated events and the reader because of their marginal position, they create a reality effect by placing the characters in the narrative and the readers Ã¶/the narrative on the same plane of reality. These footnotes can be attributed to characters within the narrative, as in Carter Dickson's The Reader is Warned, to the author of the narrative, as in Edmund Crispin's Holy Disorders, or to both, as in S. S. Van Dine's Philo Vance series, be- ginning with The Benson Murder Case. Because these footnotes are attributed ei- ther to diegetic characters or to conversations between the characters and the author, they also imply that the characters break through the narrative frame to participate in extratextual reality.6 However, all of these texts - even those written by Americans7 - belong sub- generically to the British Golden Age whodunit: a subgenre produced predomi- nantly between the First and Second World Wars that specialized in the clue-puzzle form of detective fiction and that strictly defined the rules for participation. Because these regulations imposed the "voracious formalism" (225) that Hartman notes upon the narratives in the genre, their authors needed a way to present the situation as realistically plausible. The artificial paratexts, despite calling attention to the tex- tuality of these novels, also work to establish their realism by implying that the characters and the extratextual reader live in the same world. However, these foot- notes also highlight how these texts maintain the generic tropes established for the British Golden Age whodunit. As the footnotes cross physical textual boundaries to establish reality by writing in the margins of the page, these narratives reinforce their adherence to generic boundaries, underscoring their fictionality. Hartman's "voracious formalism" (225) enables the simultaneous experience of reality effect and metafictional layering because the extratextual reader, as a sec- ond-order observer, experiences the text as both a report and as a novel at the same time. This layering occurs because, as Peter Rabinowitz suggests, different levels of reading audiences allow novels to be experienced as "both true and untrue" {Before Reading 94). In Rabinowitz's terms, when the footnotes in detective fiction gener- ate a reality effect, they seemingly work on the level of the narrative audience, that is, the observer position within the story world that the actual reader takes on. When the footnotes call attention to the fictionality of the text, they could be understood to work on the level of the authorial audience, that is, the audience for whom "they [the authors] design their books rhetorically" {Before Reading 21), which is capable of understanding the metafictional resonances of the novel. These footnotes are dis- tinctive because they perform two functions. By extending the boundaries of the</page><page sequence="6">204 Malcah Effron story world into the real world, they give the narrative audience an additional war- rant for believing in the reality of what is being read, but that extension also has consequences for the extratextual reader.8 Although the authorial audience never loses sight of the fact that both the body of the text and the footnotes are fictional constructs, the extratextual reader, who takes on the position of both the authorial audience and the narrative audience, feels the force of that claim for reality and may temporarily feel as if it overpowers the authorial audience's awareness of the ulti- mate fictionality of the novel. Before specifically examining the work of footnotes in detective fiction, I should note a potential objection to some instances of the use of Maloney 's term ar- tificial paratext. In his classification, Maloney suggests that artificial paratexts are those visually paratextual materials that derive from within the fictional world gen- erated by the narrative frame rather than from extratextual reality. In this sense, while footnotes signed by characters are clearly fictional paratexts in accordance with both Genette's and Maloney's definitions, notes presented by the named author of the text might not seem to belong in the category of artificial paratext. However, for the texts that I examine here, I propose that the named authors are "on some ground" fictional because they are all pseudonyms (Genette 340): S. S. Van Dine is a pseudonym for the literary critic Willard Huntington Wright; Carter Dickson is a pseudonym for the detective writer John Dickson Carr; and Edmund Crispin is a pseudonym for composer Robert Bruce Montgomery. As discussed later, I argue that the pseudonyms have similar textual existence to the characters in the narra- tives because they, too, are constructs of the novels; therefore, paratexts attributed to these authors should be considered artificial paratexts. TOWARD THE REALITY EFFECT The footnote creates the mode of nonfiction rather than fiction; as Peter Cos- grove notes, rhetorically, it has "the privileged exteriority of the independent wit- ness" (133). However, Cosgrove also notes that this privileged form "becomes part of the forms of persuasion, and in fact the most insidious of all the forms - that which disclaims any intention to persuade" (133). This insidious persuasion occurs as the footnotes seek to persuade us of the text's nonfictional status through their undeclared mimicry of generic forms. So, the footnote serves as a reality effect not only in Roland Barthes's original sense of the wealth of minute details that over- whelm the description of the scene to create a believable situation (14), but also in that the paratextual material formats the text so that it appears in the generic mode of nonfiction rather than fiction. Consequently, the extratextual reader initially shares the narrative audience's belief in the reality of the narrative's events. This dynamic appears particularly forcefully in S. S. Van Dine's Philo Vance novels, since the identified author of the series also appears as a character within the text, so the paratextual material appears specifically to endorse Genette's notion that fictional paratexts provide "a wholly plausible authorial function" (342). In using footnotes, the author-character S. S. Van Dine seeks to formalize his role as</page><page sequence="7">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 205 an editor of historical - rather than fictional - case files. Van Dine is assisted by the publishers at Charles Scribner's Sons, as the footnotes' nonfictional image is bol- stered by the layers of artificial paratexts that preface the first novel, The Benson Murder Case. The novel begins with the publisher's note that "[i]t gives us consid- erable pleasure to be able to offer to the public the 'inside' record of those of former District Attorney Markham's criminal cases in which Mr. Philo Vance figured so ef- fectively" {Benson v). While the publisher's note is unsigned except to indicate that it is a publisher's note, the introductory remark that follows it is signed by S. S. Van Dine, as is the note that prefaces the second novel in the series, The Canary Murder Case. These paratextual layers set the tone for the editorializing footnotes that ac- company most of these novels, which are repeatedly titled as case files. With such introductions, the footnotes are clearly positioned to work as edito- rial notes that confirm the reality of the situation by providing what the publisher's note calls "inside" information or by confirming the accuracy of the information presented within the body of the narrative. For instance, in The Kidnap Murder Case, at one point Van Dine interrupts his narrative with a footnote to indicate that "I have made one small and wholly immaterial change. ... I have used the year in which I am actually writing the record of that memorable case, instead of stating the exact year in which it occurred. . . . [I]t will not be difficult to find the [actual] year by referring to the back file of newspapers" (246n). While Van Dine in fact identi- fies an inaccuracy in the body of the narrative, as he has "made one small . . . change" (246n; my emphasis), he defends the accuracy of the rest of the material by stating the singularity of the alteration. Also, by identifying the change, Van Dine indicates that the narrative he recounts does not exist solely within the text in hand, for he alludes to extratextual sources that can provide the correction to the error, namely "the back file of newspapers." As Van Dine argues that the altered year con- stitutes a "wholly immaterial change," for the sake of narrative coherence, he does not need to make the change or to mention any year at all. The mention of a year ap- pears to be a device contrived to confirm the existence of the newspaper archive. Since newspapers generally fall into the category of nonfiction rather than fiction, the allusion to "the back file of newspapers" seeks to validate not only the accuracy but also the reality of the story. Furthermore, by referring to newspapers, the foot- notes suggest that the story is not contained exclusively in the presented narrative and that this narrative does not generate the characters and the events in the story. Rather, the footnotes suggest instead that these characters and events have an extra- textual existence. To create this illusion, the text calls attention to its own textuality, reinforcing its status not simply as a narrative but also as an object. This tendency follows Ben- stock's argument, as she notes that "the footnote in fiction operates in much the same way as it does in criticism: to call attention to the presence of author and reader on textual grounds" (205). Here, Benstock determines that the presence of footnotes in a fictional text inherently calls attention to that text as a physical object. While in some cases the attention to the book as artifact serves a metafictional func- tion to highlight the artificiality of its construction, in the case of these footnotes "the presence of author and reader" maintains the illusion that the text belongs to</page><page sequence="8">206 Malcah Effron the genre of case file rather than of novel. These detective novels thus differ from the more standard artificial paratexts in twentieth-century narratives. In calling at- tention to "the presence of author and reader," non-generically classified twentieth- century texts, like Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire, emphasize the distinction between the textual and the real. However, the artificial paratexts in these detective novels reinforce - if not solely support - the realistic presentation of the narrative, especially as they visually allow the characters to cross the borders of the narrative. This crossing creates the appearance that they transcend the textual plane and exist on the plane of the extratextual reader. Artificial paratexts in detective fiction repeatedly shift self-conscious textual- ity from a marker of fictionality to a form of reality effect, as is also apparent in Carter Dickson's use of footnotes in The Reader is Warned. In the signed footnotes, the signatory indicates that "[i]n looking over these notes of what I said, I think it only fair to add that Constable was not killed by any mechanical device which op- erated in the absence of the guilty person. The presence of the guilty person was necessary to make the method succeed. The reader is warned. - J. S." (Dickson 68n). The "J. S." who signs the note is one of the characters, but, unlike in the Van Dine novels, is not the narrator, as the text is presented, with minor exceptions, by a third-person omniscient narrator. "J. S." refers to the principal detective's medical sidekick, Dr. John Sanders. Despite the suggested correlation between these charac- ters and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, Dickson's Sanders does not have the authorial control of Doyle's Watson, so his paratextual interjection seems out of place. Thus, with this interjection and the ones that follow, Sanders seemingly crosses from the fictional plane of the read into the real plane of the extratextual reader, as his comments specifically indicate that he has material access to the manuscript: he is "looking over these notes" (Dickson 68n). The note participates in the reality effect by using the text's physicality to effect the reality that the case file genre creates in the Van Dine novels. In some cases, however, the narrative self-reflexively invokes its fictionality, so the footnotes seek to defend the author against these internal accusations. For in- stance, Edmund Crispin's detective protagonist Gervase Fen proposes that a partic- ular knot is called a "Hook, Line and Sinker [because] the reader needs to swallow it" (87). Crispin footnotes Fen's comment, endorsing its metatextual resonance by sparring with the fictional character across the margins of the page: "This is outra- geous, tantamount to accusing me of invention. The knot does of course exist, is known as the sheet bend, and is much used in climbing - E. C." (87n). Claiming that the protagonist's statement is "tantamount to accusing me of invention," Crispin counters the self-conscious awareness of fictionality in the body of the nar- rative and subsumes the response into the component of the reality effect. As such, this note works in the manner of Mayer's authenticating notes because they "reas- sure readers that apparently fantastic parts of the narrative are in fact true" (916). By insisting on the existence of the knot that the textual character suggests is a ploy to mislead a gullible reader, Crispin defends the real existence of the device. In con- firming the extratextual existence of this one detail, Crispin suggests that, by logical</page><page sequence="9">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 207 extrapolation, the rest of the narrative is similarly real. In this sense, the footnote, which breaks the physical frame of the page, seeks to repair the damage caused by the textually self-conscious assertions from within the textual frame. Furthermore, in responding to the character's remarks, Crispin suggests that Fen's remarks are autonomous. By defending himself against the character's comments, Crispin im- plies that the criticism, and hence the character, exists outside his control. If the nar- rative and its characters exist outside of his authorial control, then the characters appear to have an independent existence that establishes their extratextual reality. In an inverted manner, Crispin's narrative also uses footnotes to reassert autho- rial control over the character, but even in his attempts to assert control Crispin seemingly enables the fictional characters to cross into the extratextual plane. At one moment Gervase Fen, the detective protagonist, regrets that "my own processes of deduction were chancy, too. . . . That's one reason why I hope this affair won't go into the Chronicles of Crispin" (Crispin 256), which the author footnotes with the reply "Vain hope. - E.C." (256n). Here, Crispin reinforces that the narrative has been chronicled and that it does not simply rely on the extratextual reader, as sec- ond-order observer, to infer that the event must have been chronicled for he or she is reading it. With this reinforcement, Crispin asserts his control over the narrative, since he decides what will or will not be chronicled. Nevertheless, Crispin's mar- ginal dialogue with the character confirms the protagonist's notion that the narrative is a chronicle, a genre that has a similar nonfictional status to that of the case file in which Van Dine's narratives are meant to participate. Though seemingly asserting authorial control, in fact Crispin cedes the control to experience, as instead he indi- cates that he records the events post facto rather than invents them. Furthermore, the character's ability to identify the narratives as "the Chronicles of Crispin" (256) im- plies that the character is aware of his author, who, unlike S.S. Van Dine, otherwise only appears in the paratexts and therefore theoretically should have the same rela- tion to his characters as Charles Dickens or George Eliot have to theirs. As initially presented in Crispin's defensive response to the character's claim of fictionality with regard to the knot, the author and protagonist have a close relationship of mu- tual awareness that works to align the textual and the extratextual planes. As the artificial paratexts align the textual and extratextual frames in these de- tective novels, they create the illusion of an alignment between the textual and ex- tratextual planes of reality by reformatting the narrative as nonfiction. The different methods of the artificial paratexts all work to present the stories they accompany as reported rather than invented, so these devices suggest the reality of the narratives. As footnotes, these paratexts call attention to the narratives as texts and as read ob- jects. Transcending the planes of reality, they correlate the positions of the textual writer and the extratextual reader by showing that the writer is a reader of the docu- ment through his annotations of the text. Rather than undermine the plausibility of the narrative through attention to creative structure, as is typically suggested in re- lation to non-generically categorized fiction, particular attention to the narrative's textuality underscores the implied reality of the story and thus works as a compo- nent of the reality effect.</page><page sequence="10">208 Malcah Effron AWAY FROM THE REALITY EFFECT In the above examples from Crispin, the novel simultaneously undermines and underscores its own metafictionality. It undermines the metafictional aspects be- cause the footnotes seemingly work to create a mimetic effect by aligning the reali- ties of the author and the character. The character seems to transcend the boundaries of fictional space because the narrative presents itself as a chronicle, not just a de- tective novel. More deliberately, in the case of naming the knot, Crispin's note re- jects the assumptions that allow the comment in the body of the text to maintain its metafictionality, for his note denies the proposition that a fictional character within a fiction recognizes a detail of his situation as a fictional device employed in a fic- tional narrative. This ability of the author and character to converse, albeit in the margins of the text, seems to align the textual and extratextual planes of reality and thus to function as a reality effect. Nevertheless, the ability of the author to engage in a conversation with his character underscores the metafictionality of the moment, as it highlights the awareness of text as text that Benstock and Maloney find in arti- ficial paratexts - not simply the awareness of the text as an object that generates the reality effect from these footnotes. Furthermore, these footnotes underscore these metafictional moments by call- ing attention to the throwaway lines that otherwise would be subsumed into the tempestuous flow of the narrative. Dworkin notes that the superscript numeral that indicates the presence of a note is called "the callout or indicator" (6), and this lan- guage of signaling suggests a correlation between the form of the footnote and (vi- sual) attention. With the attention the footnote brings to this brief comment, rather than seeming to repair the fissure created in the body of the narrative, the footnote emphasizes and widens the metafictional rift. That the reality effect implicitly fails in artificial paratexts is particularly ap- parent in that the same footnotes that endorse the text's presentation as a historical document underscore a correlation between the presented text and the published rules of the Golden Age detective novel. The footnotes thus seemingly situate the narrative for the authorial audience, as they identify the information the author as- sumes the extratextual reader has - namely familiarity with generic forms and ex- emplars. This situation, however, is not necessarily distinct from the position of the narrative audience, as the marginal location of the footnotes indicates that the tex- tual characters - those speaking directly to the narrative audience - have the same knowledge of detective fiction tropes as is expected of the authorial (and perhaps actual) audience. This confusion of audience, which comprises the complete expe- rience of the extratextual reader, calls attention to the problematic relationship be- tween form and representation on the boundaries of the page. For instance, in Dickson's The Reader is Warned, the signed footnotes serve the titular function of warning the reader and thus follow various interwar publica- tions' exhortations that the detective novel must not mislead the reader. The signa- tory character, Sanders, particularly identifies that his reasons for interceding in the narrative with the footnotes pertain to the injunctions of "fair play" associated with the detective fiction genre. Sanders highlights this intention when he comments that</page><page sequence="11">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 209 "I think it only fair" (Dickson 68n) and that "[t]he reader is warned" (68n). Here, the footnotes take on the function of the textual pause we see in Ellery Queen nov- els when the reader is informed that "[t]he solution - or enough of it to point unerr- ingly to the guilty character - may be reached by a series of logical deductions and psychological observations. . . . 'Let the reader beware!'" (Queen 268). However, the footnoted form of the advisory in the Dickson novel complicates the function of the "interlude" moments of the Queen novels; instead of choosing to interrupt the narrative as Queen's interludes do, Dickson's footnotes surreptitiously include the warning by placing it outside the body of the text in the margins of the page. Visu- ally, the warning serves as an addendum rather than a break, maintaining the struc- tural integrity of the narrative as presented on the page. While this structural integrity enables Sanders's marginal transgression to create the sense that he, and therefore his fellow characters, exist outside the confines of the narrative, the visual boundary is transgressed for the specific purpose of identifying the text as a correct model of detective fiction according to the published standards. In this case, the footnote undercuts its authority as an element of the reality effect because its con- tents ultimately do not support the extratextual reality of the narrative; instead they confirm its status as a proper detective novel. Dickson's footnotes might seem to differ from those in Van Dine' s novels be- cause their role in confirming the proper execution of the detective narrative under- mines the footnote's reality effect. However, Van Dine also includes footnotes that depend on generic expectations, so, like Maloney notes about postmodern metafic- tion, the footnotes in detective fiction "do double work. They both bolster the sense of realism and call our attention to the fictionality of the works themselves" (Mal- oney 11). For instance, in explaining the validity of a device in The Benson Murder Case - the first novel in the series and the one that appears with the publisher's note - Van Dine claims in the body of the text that Philo Vance, the amateur detec- tive, alludes to a previous case that has used a similar method. The footnote seem- ingly wishes to defend Vance's allusion, claiming, "I don't know what case Vance was referring to; but there are several instances of this device on record, and writers of detective fiction have often used it. The latest instance is to be found in G. K. Chesterton's 'The Innocence of Father Brown,' in the story entitled The Wrong Shape' " (Van Dine, Benson 88n). While Van Dine briefly alludes to "several in- stances of this device on record," the sentence ends by invoking tropes of detective fiction, thus emphasizing the fictional form. Furthermore, the only concrete exam- ple given refers to an example from detective fiction, not nonfiction. While these ex- amples seem to confirm the reality of the device in Mayer's sense of the footnote "reassur[ing] readers that apparently fantastic parts of the narrative are in fact true" (916), the note merely confirms the validity of the device as a generic fictional tool. Instead of maintaining the faÃ§ade of the case file, the close correlation between a known fictional trope and the presented detective narrative highlights that the case file in hand is yet another detective novel. Furthermore, this example relates to Benstock's notion that "the footnote in fiction operates the same way it does in criticism" (205), as Van Dine uses this note for referencing. Just as academic essays use footnotes to cite ideas that do not orig-</page><page sequence="12">210 MalcahEffron inate with the writer, Van Dine (the pseudonymous author rather than the textual character) acknowledges other writers who establish the device before he adopts it for his own narrative. When read as acknowledging a source of inspiration, this de- vice further undermines the reality of the case file format because it underscores the narrative as invention rather than as report. Thus, the footnote sets out to establish the believable reality of the device by referring to a record of its appearance, but in- stead defends the narrative as a superior example of the detective genre. It can be seen that the illusion of nonfiction created by the format of the foot- note on the page is undermined by the generic codes that the footnotes seek to af- firm. Though the narratives seem to maintain a degree of verisimilitude in the body of the text, the footnotes call attention to an organization that relates to the genre of detective fiction rather than to the genre of nonfictional reporting. Though the for- matting of a nonfictional report seems to contradict the assumed fictional presenta- tion of the detective genre, this self-consciousness of genre also suggests that the footnotes cross visual boundaries without crossing generic ones. This crossing fur- ther illustrates the flexibility of the detective genre to allow for different narrative forms within a rigid set of rules such as those established for the Golden Age detec- tive novel. It also shows the flexibility of the artificial paratext to manipulate multi- ple generic forms while simultaneously adhering to one particular form absolutely. By extension, the multiple meanings developed through these forms demonstrate how the elements used to establish verisimilitude can undermine themselves to re- veal the fiction they seek to hide. ARTIFICIAL PARATEXTS, SENDERS, AND VIRTUAL REALITY From the above examples, we see that artificial paratexts seem to generate Barthes's reality effect in that they visually simulate forms of generic nonfiction and that they either allow the characters to cross into the discursive space of the ex- tratextual author or editor or allow the author or editor to enter the discursive space of the fictional characters. However, the content of artificial paratexts confirms not only the textual element of the narrative but also the fictional and generic aspects of the narrative, thereby undermining the reality effect created by the visual presenta- tion of the marginal discourse. In this manner, artificial paratexts do not highlight the nonfictional genres they visually mimic but instead highlight the fictional genres to which the narratives conform. While the content of the paratextual material un- dermines the generic approach to the reality effect, the senders of the paratextual material also mitigate the effectiveness of the margins to function as a space through which the textual planes can be crossed, particularly in the cases of the S. S. Van Dine and the Edmund Crispin novels. In both these cases, the authors of the title pages sign the footnotes, but both names are also pseudonyms and, as such, are yet another fiction generated by the novels. This dynamic is particularly clear in Van Dine's case, as S. S. Van Dine appears as a character within the body of the text as well as a signatory of the footnote, but it might be less clear in Edmund Crispin's case, as Crispin appears in the text in the role of the writer of the narrative rather</page><page sequence="13">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 211 than specifically in the role of a character in the narrative. Nevertheless, I suggest that Edmund Crispin and the other pseudonyms, despite their place on the cover and the title page, are equally characters of the novels they purport to have written as characters within the narrative. One might argue that these pseudonyms could be considered implied authors rather than characters (with regard to narratology's distinction between real and im- plied authors); in this case, the physical author would be the real author, and the pseudonym could name the implied author. Since Wayne Booth introduced the term implied author in The Rhetoric of Fiction, narrative theory has debated whether the implied author constitutes an anthropomorphic character created by the text or, as Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan suggests, "is best considered as a set of implicit norms" (Rimmon-Kenan 88).9 Within this debate, however, narrative theorists who accept the term have most frequently gravitated to Rimmon-Kenan's idea that the most productive use of the implied author is as "a set of implicit norms," rather than as an identifiable character generated by the text. Even perspectives that follow Seymour Chatman's notion that the implied author "is nothing other than the text in its in- ventional aspect" (86) retain this non-anthropomorphic interpretation. James Phe- lan has recently sought to reclaim an anthropomorphic version of the implied author, defining the term as "a streamlined version of the real author, an actual or purported subset of the real author's capacities . . . and other properties that play an active role in the construction of a particular text" (45; emphasis original); here, Phelan enables narrative theory to re-engage with narrative as the product of an au- thor rather than simply as a construct of the reader. Ansgar Niinning supports the utility of this definition, as it "moves [the implied author] outside the text, thus re- establishing a close link between the flesh and blood author and the implied author" (99). However, while this redefinition re-anthropomorphizes the implied author by connecting it more closely to the real author, Phelan's and Niinning's approaches do not resuscitate the notion of the implied author as a character constructed by the text. These approaches leave room for the reading of the pseudonym as character, especially in cases where the pseudonymous authors appear as characters within the narrative, even if only on the margins of the page. This possibility is particularly relevant in relation to Susan Lanser's character- ization of the problematic status of the implied author in our understanding of the relation between the author and text. Lanser suggests that "if texts exist only when there are authors, authors exist only when there are texts. . . . [H]aving produced the text, the author must surely exist outside and before the text; yet if the text produces the author, then the author can only be found in the text" (154). This complication cannot exist in the same manner in relation to the position of the pseudonym, as, on- tologically, the pseudonymous figure exists only "m the text," or at least on it. Be- cause the pseudonymous authors considered here appear within the body of the detective novels, they demonstrate the connection between the character created both in the narrative and on the title page, highlighting the pseudonym as yet an- other creation of the text.10 Rabinowitz proposes a means by which this analysis might correlate to the implied author as a textual creation when he notes that the "procedure for creating the implied author is the same as [for] creating a character"</page><page sequence="14">212 MalcahEffron ("Absence"). This correlation suggests that the discussion of pseudonym as charac- ter might open another way to understand the implied author as an anthropomor- phized character. For the purposes of this article, however, I remain focused on the pseudonym as both paratextual and artificially paratextual in these detective series to examine the simultaneous generation of both reality effect and metafictionality. To account for the status of the pseudonym, Robert Griffin critiques the domi- nant critical approach to authorship, which sees the author as a product of capitalist production and explicitly ties the name of the author to the professionalization of writing. He proposes that this approach has prevented studies of anonymous and pseudonymous publishing trends that account for post- Victorian uses of the form. Furthermore, he critiques Michel Foucault's approach to the author-position as a particularly modern phenomenon distinctly tied to a name ("Anonymity" 877). However, in revising the limited language of Foucault's argument, Griffin rejects the notion of the author-function as tied to a name, but he does not undermine the sense of the author-function. Rather, Griffin seeks to expand the category to include anonymous and pseudonymous authors, and the other pieces in his edited collection in The Faces of Anonymity similarly seek to revise approaches to the name of the author. However, in the challenges these articles make to current histories of the motives behind anonymous and pseudonymous publication trends, these arguments engage with the name of the author in an epitextual rather than paratextual fashion. Without wishing to challenge the modifications that Griffin suggests, I return to Foucault to look at the pseudonym as paratext, in Genette's sense that paratexts exist between text and off-text. Foucault suggests that "[i]t would be just as wrong to equate the author with the real writer as to equate him with the fictitious speaker [i.e. the T in a first-person narrative]" (152). Foucault and Barthes here agree that the "author" is a position in relation to the text distinct from the human who physi- cally composes the manuscript. If the author is not necessarily "the real writer" (Foucault 152) and develops with the text rather than exists as a precursor to it, then the name on the title page refers better to the authorial position than to an individual in extratextual reality. Griffin, despite his alternate focus, legitimates this assump- tion, as he defends the idea that the "author's name . . . operates in discourse inde- pendently of its possible reference to an empirical person" ("Anonymity" 882; my emphasis). Griffin qualifies his argument, but Barthes and Foucault do not qualify theirs, so here I problematize the relationship between the name of the author and the "empirical person" who bears the same name. By extrapolation, the pseudonym, which is also generated by the author of the textual narrative and does not directly identify an "empirical person," is necessarily tied to the textual rather than extratex- tual plane. Genette underscores this aspect of the author-function in relation to the pseudonym when he proposes that "a pseudonym is already a poetic activity, and the pseudonym is already somewhat like a work" (54). Genette not only isolates the pseudonym from an "empirical person" but also ties it into the aesthetic goal of lit- erary creation. With this disconnect of the author-function from the empirical individual, this reading of the boundary-crossing between the title page and the textual page also suggests possible analysis of footnotes that are signed by non-psuedonymous au-</page><page sequence="15">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 213 thors. Despite the theoretical distance between the author- function and the empirical author, in restricting this analysis to the pseudonymous figure, we can avoid onto- logical complications created by the signifying function of the non-pseudonymous author's name in extratextual reality. While an analysis of character developed through the pseudonym's transcendence of the textual and paratextual spaces might open a means of contemplating the consequences of similar narrative movements on the part of non-pseudonymous authors, for the purposes of this analysis, I only con- sider the fiction of the pseudonym in relation to the fiction of the artificial paratexts as on the same ontological plane. Masking the position of the author as literary cre- ation, the narrative makes a metafictive move to use the reality effect of the author- position on the title page; this reality effect confuses the extratextual reader's experience of the divide not only between text and off-text but also between the on- tological statuses of the author-narrator and the extratextual reader. The Van Dine and Crispin novels overtly demonstrate this notion of the pseu- donym as a literary creation because the pseudonyms do not remain on the covers and title pages but enter the text, especially through the annotations. Ralph Hanna III asserts that an annotator "is in fact creating himself as a reader - and thus creates the reader of his work" (18 1).11 As seen in relation to Dr. Sanders in the Dickson novel, annotations indicate that the text has been read. Because all notes are signed either explicitly - as in the case of Sanders and Crispin - or implicitly - as in the case of S. S. Van Dine - they not only show that the text has been read but also es- tablish the reader as a participant in the text (Hanna's "creating himself as a reader"). If defining the self as reader establishes an image of "the reader of his work," the annotations in these detective novels create the signatories as readers of the texts. By proposing that the footnotes create the reader of a text, Hanna suggests that they identify the means of reading as the authorial audience. However, in cases where the footnotes are authored by pseudonyms, this inclusion of the author within the narrative seems to equate the author with the narrator. The textually proposed equation of the author with the narrator suggests that the reader created by the foot- notes, in Hanna's sense, might similarly equate the authorial audience with the nar- rative audience. That is, the equation of author with narrator might suggest that the authorial and narrative audiences need the same underlying assumptions to under- stand the text; this dynamic generates the reality effect. The extratextual reader's second-order observer position, however, instead highlights how the author-posi- tion is subsumed by the fiction. This relationship further complicates the planes of reality, since for the duration of reading, this audience accepts the experiences of the speakers within the fictional narrative, including the pseudonym, as real. Be- cause the extratextual reader maintains the distinction between reading as the au- thorial audience of the writer and the narrative audience of the pseudonymous author-narrator, he or she retains the tacit knowledge that this footnote is a strategic move on the part of the author, as is the creation "the reader of his work" in the pseuodonymous authorial figure. In creating the opportunity for this multi-layered reading experience, the pseudonymous signatory of the footnotes contributes to the simultaneous production of reality effect and metafictionality by complicating the relationship between the borders of the page and the bounds of the narrative fiction.</page><page sequence="16">214 MalcahEffron Because the footnotes create the "reader of his work" on the page and not sim- ply as an abstraction, the "reader of his work" is established not only in the extra- textual sense of an idealized audience but also in a textual sense of a character in the text who is a reader of the text. As suggested above, the paratexts not only highlight the text as a manuscript but also create the annotator in the character of a reader. Thus, the pseudonyms cease to exist solely as author-positions and explicitly mani- fest themselves as characters within the text, albeit (in some cases literally) margin- alized characters. We can thus see that the pseudonyms are constructs of these fictional texts; in relation to the paratextual material, they denote "a sender [who] is, on some ground, fictional" (Genette 340). Despite the structuralist positioning of the author as divorced from the "empir- ical person" (Griffin, "Anonymity" 882) of the writer, the pseudonyms' positions as textual constructs are complicated by the extratextual existence of the authors who use them; the pseudonyms still, in some sense, refer to those particular people, and they can be - and are - used in extratextual situations. For instance, Willard Hunt- ington Wright has signed autographs with the name S. S. Van Dine. This example might seem to undermine the claim that the pseudonym is strictly a textual con- struct, for the pseudonymous authors seem to exist on the same plane as the mem- bers of the actual audience, as both are terms that identify what Rabinowitz calls "flesh-and-blood people" (Before Reading 20). However, rather than giving an ex- tratextual ontological existence to the pseudonym, I suggest that such behavior cor- relates to the behavior of extratextual authors presenting themselves in the guise of their characters. For instance, Priscilla Walton and Manina Jones note that the de- tective writer Mickey Spillane's promotional strategies "included making public appearances costumed as [his] detective [Mike Hammer]" (183). It would hardly be argued that Mike Hammer is not a character created by Mickey Spillane, despite his assumption of his character's persona for the public appearances. Wright's extratex- tual use of S. S. Van Dine can be understood as a similar assumption of a character's persona. Griffin accurately notes that detective writers have used pseudonyms because of the stigma of writing popular fiction ("Anonymity" 885), as is the case for Van Dine and Crispin. However, these authors also use the authority of the pseudonym as detective fiction writers when they publish critical essays and edited collections under the pseudonym, such as Van Dine's "Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Sto- ries," which he authored, and The World's Great Detective Stories, which he edited.12 Though the pseudonyms might initially be used to protect the extratextual author from loss of authority associated with popular fiction, ultimately that pseu- donymous figure is necessary to establish authority. Since these pseudonyms are textual characters and not just markers of Foucault's author- function, and since they function both as textual characters and as authors or editors of critical texts and an- thologies, they problematize the positioning of reality and fiction. In using the pseudonyms to establish the author's or editor's authority in the field of detective fiction, they highlight that the novels in which the pseudonyms appear are fictional. As such, the pseudonym's epitextual appearances propose that character development</page><page sequence="17">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 215 is not necessarily limited to the novels in which these authorial figures appear but can be developed through works that otherwise appear nonfictional. In this manner, they generate metafictive effects by creating a reality effect through both paratex- tual and epitextual material, and the method initially used to avoid losing extratex- tual authority becomes a means to establish it. Regardless of the motive behind these forms, the artificial paratexts call atten- tion to the position of the pseudonym as a character of the narrative and perhaps thus as a narrative construct. Positing the pseudonym as a fictional character, the ar- tificial paratexts reveal their metafictionality rather than their reality effect not sim- ply in the content of their comments but also in the assertion of the text as object. Though Fen's and Crispin's dialogue might feel strange when we think of the au- thor as someone wholly external to the characters - as we might consider the rela- tionship between George Eliot and her characters - this approach to the pseudonym as textual construct might allow us to rethink these relationships. By using pseudonyms not only to publish texts in popular genres but also to sign the footnotes that appear within those texts, these authors highlight the pseu- donym as a character created in conjunction with the narrative rather than as a per- son who exists in extratextual reality. These pseudonyms call attention to their role as a point of interpÃ©nÃ©tration between the textual and extratextual planes of reality, further blurring the already ambiguous boundary between reality and fiction. These footnotes thus open the question of the importance of the pseudonym as character rather than as person or as place-holder. They call attention not only to the issue of fictional narrative that seeks to imitate an image of reality but also to extratextual reality that turns itself into fiction. Thus, they suggest that literary experimentation extends beyond the historically chronicled shifts in the position of the author. ON THE BORDERS OF GENRE In moving from a historically centered analysis of the footnote in fiction to an analysis of generic experimentation, we see that artificial paratexts indicate not only their role in the development of metafictionality but also their participation in both rewriting and reaffirming generic boundaries. By focusing on a popular genre, and on detective fiction in particular, we can see how attention to textuality that is high- lighted in studies of footnotes in non-generically classified texts can initially work toward stabilization of the textual narrative rather than toward its deterioration. The detective genre in particular allows for such stabilization as the story involved lends itself to the nonfictional genres of the report or the case file. By establishing these narratives as records or chronicles rather than inventions, these footnotes indicate that textual self-consciousness does not overtly evoke metafictional tendencies but rather refocuses on generic self-consciousness. Instead, the metafictional aspects of these artificial paratexts become apparent not as they call attention to the text as text but as they call attention to the narrative as genre. As the footnotes articulate manners by which the narratives participate in</page><page sequence="18">216 Ma leak Effron the detective genre, they call attention to the story as a fiction rather than to the non- fictional status that the visual format of the page would suggest. This emphasis on fiction becomes possible because the texts participate in codified genres rather than in the experimental form of Laurence Sterne, James Joyce, or postmodernist novel- ists. These footnotes in detective texts use the form to call attention to the self-con- scious content in a fashion that outwardly disguises this self-consciousness, thus enabling the texts to project concurrently a sense of reality and of fictionality. By using footnotes to create simultaneously Genette's sense of "narratorial-au- thorial discourse" (340) and "a wholly plausible authorial function" (342), these de- tective narratives underscore how the reality effect can turn against itself to undermine the realism generated by the artificial paratexts. This "double work" (Maloney 11) succeeds because of the footnotes' position in the visual borders of the narrative. As outside the body of the narrative, the footnotes appear extratextual, but as a part of the text, they remain part of the fiction. Unlike in non-generically classified twentieth-century texts that use artificial paratexts, in these detective nov- els, footnotes neither challenge the reality of the material nor become an essential part of the narrative. Nevertheless, their marginal function illustrates that apparent textuality can either underscore or undermine the realism created through the dif- ferent components of the reality effect. While textual self-consciousness often indi- cates metafictionality, in these instances the metafictionality relies on generic self-referentiality and implication rather than textual self-consciousness. The ques- tion of genre here becomes paramount in contemplating the border between reality and fictionality exposed in the borders of the pages, since the generic tropes of de- tective fiction initially undermine the footnotes' illusion of nonfiction. This initial generic conflict between detective fiction and the nonfictional authority of the para- text exposes the false correlation between the extratextual plane of the pseudony- mous author and the textual plane of the character, as it calls attention to the pseudonymous author's existence as character of the reader of the text rather than as extratextual writer of the novel. By crossing the visual border between the read and the reader, these footnotes call attention to the physicality of these texts, and thus to their generic tropes, transgressing the boundary between their appearance as reality and their existence as fiction. ENDNOTES 1 . For example, Shari Benstock examines the use of such footnotes in Laurence Sterne, Henry Field- ing, and James Joyce, and Stephen Barney's collection Annotation and Its Texts compiles articles analyzing the use of annotations in texts from the Middle Ages through the late twentieth century. 2. The Golden Age of detective fiction generally refers to crime writing during the era bounded by the two World Wars and is known especially for the whodunit style of detective novel, such as that pio- neered by Agatha Christie. 3. In detective fiction scholarship, this quote is attributed to S. S. Van Dine, but in the 1931 edition of The World's Great Detective Stories, the chapter in which it appears is listed as written by Willard Huntington Wright, the man who uses the pseudonym S. S. Van Dine. The editor, though, is still</page><page sequence="19">Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction 2 1 7 listed as S. S. Van Dine. For this reason, despite the named author of the chapter, I have included the bibliographic reference in the works cited under Van Dine in accordance with the attribution of de- tective fiction scholarship; I can thus avoid having to cite the man as being edited by his pseudonym. 4. In using the term fictional, Maloney implies that he examines paratexts that correlate to Genette's class of fictive paratexts, which Genette identifies as those paratexts whose "sender himself is, on some ground, fictional: disavowing, fictive, or apocryphal" (340). As such, Maloney reclaims these notes from Genette's dismissal, as Genette finds "little to say about fictive . . . notes" (Genette 342). 5. I intend the term extratextual reader to refer to the physical person who reads the book and therefore exists independently of time, place, and the narrative. As I will explicate later, this is similar to, but not entirely identical with, Peter Rabinowitz's concept of the actual audience. 6. In the case of the term extratextual reality, I similarly imply the concrete physicality of the reality in which the extratextual reader exists - in other words, that which Wayne Booth has elsewhere re- ferred to as "the real world." I refer to this plane of reality as extratextual reality in order to maintain parallel structure of language in speaking about different planes of reality. I further choose the term extratextual reality to indicate the space outside the constructs of the textual narrative without be- coming entangled in discussing the nature of this reality, as the nature of the extratextual plane of re- ality is immaterial to a discussion that depends on its existence rather than its form. 7. S. S. Van Dine and Carter Dickson are American authors who write in the British style of the genre developed during the interwar period, rather than the American hard-boiled style that arose during the same historical era. 8. Though the actual audience can be considered the extratextual audience in that it necessarily con- tains both the authorial and the narrative audiences because the latter two are different facets of reading, Rabinowitz stresses the position of the actual audience to focus on the differences that each member brings to the reading experience "depending upon such variables as class, gender, race, per- sonality . . . and historical situation" {Before Reading 21). My use of the extratextual reader, how- ever, is more directly focused on the existence of a second-order observer capable of participating in and acknowledging that participation in both the authorial and the narrative audiences at the same time. 9. This debate originates within Booth's work and persists through contemporary narrative theory dis- course. For a fuller overview of the debates around the position and the terminology of the implied author, see such articles as Seymour Chatman's chapter "In Defense of the Implied Author" in Com- ing to Terms, Nilli Diengott's response "The Implied Author Once Again," David Darby's "Form and Context: An Essay on the History of Narratology," and Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Miiller's The Implied Author: Concept and Controversy. 10. Chatman's argument supporting the implied author illustrates why it is important to consider the dif- ferent positions of the extratextual author and the pseudonym. He argues that "[l]ittle is gained by assuming an 'image' of Mark Twain which is in any important respect different from the real Twain, but much is to be gained from recognizing the differences between the implied author and the narra- tor Huck Finn" (88). By referring to "the real Twain" (88), Chatman begs the question of who or what constitutes the real Twain, since the nature of the sentence implies that the reference to Twain in fact refers to Samuel Clemens. This also becomes particularly important in relation to the cited text The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, as that novel begins by mentioning "Mr. Mark Twain." The Twain examnle thus actuallv behaves in the same manner as the detective novels discussed here. 1 1 . Hanna Ill's use of the "reader of his work" (181) should not be interpreted as universally identifying the same position as what I call the extratextual reader. 12. Similarly, Ellery Queen, the pseudonym for cousins Frederic Dannay and Manford E. Lee, is both a character in detective fiction and a pseudonym that writes not only the autofictive detective novels but also edits Ellery Queen 's Mystery Magazine.</page><page sequence="20">218 MalcahEffron WORKS CITED Barthes, Roland.
