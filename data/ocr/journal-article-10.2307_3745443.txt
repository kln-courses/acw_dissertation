<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE J. C. GREGORY, B.Sc. The tomb of the ajicient Pharaoh, Tut-ankh-Amen, was opened some years ago. Lord Carnarvon, who financed the investigations, died shortly after the opening. Lord Westbury fell to his death from the high window of a London flat on February 21, 1930. His son, the Hon. Richard Bethell, had been found dead in his room the previous November. He was secretary to Mr. Howard Carter, one discoverer of Tut-ankh-Amen's tomb. Many persons who had been connected with the excavations had died previously?M. Benedite, for example, died after participating in the research, and Mrs. Greely committed suicide after visiting the tomb. The Hon. Richard Bethell was the thirteenth person connected with Tut-ankh-Amen's tomb, directly or indirectly, to die, and his father, Lord Westbury, was the fourteenth. The death of Lord Carnarvon, a few weeks after the tomb was opened, stirred the notion that a curse had been placed on the mummy of the Pharaoh, or in his tomb, to menace violators. Succeeding deaths kept the notion alive, and the thirteenth death, of the Hon. Richard Bethell, wrung an opinion from Dr. Mardus, the eminent French Egyptologist. He was convinced that the ancient Egyptians could surround "their mummies with some dynamic force." Such a force lurked in the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen. Its nature was unknown, but it had manifested itself in the series of deaths. Aristotle remarked long ago, in his Rhetoric, that history tends to repeat itself. The power lodged in the curse, or dynamic in the incantation, is a typical magical force, and the old belief in magical forces has revived in the opinion of Dr. Mardus. This belief presents itself among twentieth-century estimates of causes like a crow among pigeons. It is as alien to our modern scientific versions as these may have been alien to the thought of Tut-ankh-Amen. The contrast excites to an attempt at analysis. The attempt must be cautious and undogmatic, for it is easier to perceive that magical conceptions do differ from scientific ideas than to understand the difference. The attempt at analysis need not be hampered by a direct endeavour to decide whether fourteen deaths intimate an ancient imposition of a still effective curse. There is a magical way of thinking, there is also a contrasted scientific way, and there must be a discovefable difference between them. The disclosure of the difference may confirm the modern reluctance to credit the 379</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES perpetual lurk of potent curses in tombs, or approve the revival of magical forces by Dr. Mardus, or it may neither confirm nor approve. The disclosure may be successfully effected, or it may be very doubt- fully made. The latter alternative may be feared if Dr. Singer is com? pelled to leave magic "undefined," and to regard it provisionally "as primitive unorganized belief" in relations between causes and effects. Magic has eluded analysis too often for hopes to run too high over another attempt. Any suggested disclosure may also be doubtful if various students have drawn different inferences, and they have. Difficulties, however, though they should breed circumspection, should not daunt. The intrusion of the magically conceived curse into a modern scientific atmosphere is a challenge, and that challenge is most appropriately met by a series of explorative steps. The first step, if it can be taken, discusses the distinction between magical forces, represented by the presumed curse in Tut-ankh-Amen's tomb, and scientifically conceived causes, represented by civilized reluctance towards revivals of the magical past. We obviously do contrast magical and irrational beliefs or prac- tices with those that seem to us to be scientific and rational. The Ojebway Indian who runs a needle into the wooden image of his enemy to pain him, or burns the puppet to kill him, seems to us to act magically and irrationally because there appears to be no rational connection between maltreating an effigy and wounding its original. If he helps his little drama along by magic words, there still seems to us to be no rational procedure. If he lurks in the bush to draw bow upon his victim he still seems to us to act spitefully, but he now seems to act rationally, for a sped arrow can kill. The obvious dis? tinction between the irrational handling of the puppet and the rational use of the bow is not always so sharply present, nor is it, even when it is sharp, easy, or even possible, to define. Goldsmith said of Burke that he wound into his subject like a serpent. Burke wound onto his goal, but attempts to distinguish between irrational magic and rational science are liable to be more sinuous than success? ful. The discovery of a waxen image of Queen Elizabeth in Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1577 violently perturbed the English Court. The pierce of the pins that had been driven into the breast of the effigy seemed to be a danger to the august original, and Dr. Dee, the famous astrologer and alchemist, was hastily summoned to protect the Queen. This indurated method of wounding a person by maltreating an effigy seems to us to be obviously magical, hopelessly irrational, and manifestly futile. Many persons, the French chemist Nicolas Lemery remarked in the later seventeenth century, hung coral round their necks to prevent bleeding, to purify their blood, and to fortify their hearts. This seems to us as irrational, and as manifestly magical, as the traditional bestowal of strength by the sapphire, or of eloquence 380</page><page sequence="3">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE by the emerald, upon the wearer. The Hon. Robert Boyle, in the same century as L&amp;nery, suspected medicinal powers in gems. He disarmed our suspicions of his irrationality, or at least weakened them, by surmising that genuinely medicinal gems might scatter swift potent corpuscles into the bodies of their wearers. This rational- izing of magical beliefs often makes us hesitate between ascriptions of rational mistakes and accusations of irrational errors. The reputed powers of the planets, as well as of gems, were often rationalized in the seventeenth century by equipping the celestial bodies with corpuscular rains. It seemed to Boyle that planets might affect terrestrial events by dashing such corpuscular streams upon the earth. Such rationalized magic, that conforms apparently irrational beliefs to apparently rational conceptions, is midway between the handling of effigies to discomfit their prototypes, or the belief in styptic coral, and discarded scientific theories. Obviously magical beliefs seem to us to be both false and futile; discredited eighteenth- century science, such as the old phlogistic chemistry, seems to us to be false, but it does not seem to be hopelessly irrational. There is no sharp line between rational belief, true or false, and irrational magic, but we can recognize, on occasion, that we do draw the distinction. Socrates proposed to cure the headache of Charmides by a leaf and a charm. The leaf and the charm?Socrates was playful here, but he mentioned the drug and the spell again in the Republic. The drug can stand for rational procedure; the charm or spell can stand for magical efficacy. The contrast is only complete if the drug is a genuine medicament. The leaf or drug was not always rational pharmacy in early days, nor is it always now. The Athenian Stranger in Plato's Laws contrasted poisons that injure by "a natural law" with those that injure by sorceries, incantations, and magic bonds. The poison or the healing drug only represents rational procedure when it is a genuine medicament that operates by "a natural law." If the "leaf" playfully suggested to Charmides was thus conceived, then Socrates included a double cause in his recipe, for Charmides was asked to be both rationally physicked and magically charmed. This doubling of rational procedure and dependence on magical efficacy is one striking characteristic of the magical phase of thought. An Indian will shoot a poisoned arrow into the trail of a deer. The animal is hunted on the next day, and, if fortune favours the chase, killed by natural means. The magical supplement of striking at the deer by piercing its trail is the analogue of the charm in the double method of spell and drug. The rational procedure of the hunt is the analogue of the medicament that acts by "a natural law." The charmed net or the charmed spear is a typical instance of doubling the cause by supplementing rational procedure with magical efficacy. 381</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES New Guinea fishermen will not sail until their nets have been charmed. The indispensable charm is not sufficient, for the nets are meshed suitably, placed appropriately, and disposed properly. The con? struction and manipulation of the nets, which seem to us to be rational and sufficient, are supplemented by magical charms, which seem to us to be irrational and superfluous. The charmed spear pre? sents the same combination of rational sufficiency and irrational superfluity. A savage will make a spear, sharpen its point, aim it well, throw it hard, and perhaps smear it with poison. He will also croon a charm over it, or persuade a magician to throw a powerful spell upon it. The charmed spear, pointed to pierce and charmed to kill, is a typical combination of rational procedure and magical efficacy. The savage points his spear, sharpens it, aims it truly, and throws it hard, but the potent charm or spell makes it kill. Carveth Read has parodied a famous saying to express this double reliance on natural causes and magical powers: the savage "trusts in magic, and keeps his bowstring dry." The reliance on the double cause, on magically supplemented natural agencies, effectively contrasts the scientific or rational with the magical or irrational. The rational side of the charmed spear leans on the determinate sequence of events; the magical side leans on coercive power. The magical force, in principle, though it is usually qualified by some recognition of nature's ordained routines, can make things happen anyhow, anywhere, and at any time. The companions of Odysseus bristled into swine under the coercive power of Circe. The pumpkin was not qualified to become a coach, but it became one under the constraining wand of Cinderella's Fairy Godmother. The sheer coercive power of the magical efficacy, the making things happen by magical forces, is visible in taboos. It is visible in the deadly blanket of the New Zealand Chief that is taboo to others, and kills the imprudent wearer because it has been in contact with its lord. The taboo on the tinder-box, or other personal belonging of the Maori Chief, kills those who touch it. The sheer coercive power of the magical efficacy, that simply makes things happen, is constantly intermingled with recognitions of natural sequences, as the charmed spear must also have a point. The charmed spear combines the clearly separated natural causes and magical efficacies. The emphasis of rational procedure, that corresponds to science, falls upon determinate sequences of events; the emphasis of magic falls upon coercive powers. The sheer coerciveness of the magical efficacy contrasts with the dependence on natural causes in rational procedure. The original nature of the magical force is often concealed in the magical rite or belief, but it is clearly visible in the death-dealing taboo, and it is displayed in the doubled cause of the charmed spear. On its rational 382</page><page sequence="5">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE side the spear kills because it can pierce and does; on its magical side the charm makes it kill. Experience is the obvious source of the rational procedure, for nature insists on the sequence of thrown spear and achieved kill: the spearman knows by experience that there is no kill without a pierce, and no pierce without a point. The source of the notion of magical efficacy is less immediately obvious, but a source there must be, and it seems to be discoverable. Paley, in his famous argument, pointed to the exquisite construc? tion of a watch. A watch is skilfully constructed to keep its hands in step with the sun. If a wayfarer, Paley argued, found such a watch upon the heath, and observed this skilled construction in it, he would conclude that someone had made it. The world, Paley argued again, because it was contrived as the watch is contrived, had a maker also, as the watch has. Paley was arguing from analogy: if the world resembled the watch in being contrived, it would also resemble it in having a maker. Paley took the watch for a model, and argued from it to the world. The ancient Atomists took pointed things, like thorns or burs, for models, and argued from them to the atoms: since tartar tasted sharp, it contained pointed atoms that pricked the tongue. This method of analogy, this consultation of models, is the staff of the mind. It was deliberate with Paley, and explicit with the Atomists, but the mind is constantly appealing to a model without realizing its analogical habit. Deceptive analogies constantly seduce the unwary mind, though genuine analogies, especially if they are vigilantly employed, also illumine thought. The appeal to the model, overt or unrealized, misleading or illu- minative, is the constant habit of the human mind. Wouwerman always painted a white horse into his picture. According to Joyce, the pattern of the plump maize-cob, nature's own mosaic, can be constantly detected in Mexican incrusted work. Men have their pet models, and their thinking, like their pictures or their patterns, is liable to be dominated by them. The physiologist Camper humorously confessed that after he had studied the heads of cetacea for six months everybody appeared to him to be "narwhal, porpoise, or marsouins." Plain women, and even pretty ones, were "narwhals or porpoises" in his eyes. One great pet model has constantly dominated human thinking, for analogy, like charity, begins at home, and one great dominating pet model is the thinker's self, or his social group. He who first puts to sea in a tempest, said Donne in one of his sermons, might well think that the sea is always rough. Men are so familiar from the first with their own personal actions in making things happen, or with things happening through the actions of their fellows, that they incline to presume a personal agency, similar to human agency, in everything. This inclination is too distinctly 383</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES written on the history of human thought to be mistaken. Horner, as Zeller notes, was content with the "personal authors and divine powers" that obscure "the natural causes of things" during "the childhood of mankind." The Anglo-Saxons felt sharp pains, such as the twinge of rheumatism, as human beings have always felt them. The archer and his arrow, that inflicted a sharp pain, was one inevitable model of the disease. A mischievous elf had shot an invisible shaft into the suffering patient. These are two items in an inventory that would stretch out until the crack of doom. Even very primitive people may not be indiscriminately animistic nor anthropomorphic, but the human tendency to model all agency on personal powers is too frequently manifested, too widespread in result, and too explicit in expression, to be mistaken. Personal efficacies seem to be the source of reputed magical forces. The skill of the hunter seems to be a power within him. According to Durkheim, the suasion of the group provoked a sense in men of besetting force. Men doubtless did sense a coercive power in the grip of social tradition, public sentiment or custom, and group control. They doubtless did sense it in the solitude when there was no present hand to seize them, as the hunter's skill seemed to be a power behind, or above, the spear in his hand or the arrows in his belt. This sense of group grip doubtless strengthened the sense of personal efficacies, as Hartland has admitted, and may have been one primary source of the great dominating sense of personal powers, but men sensed efficacies in their fellows and in themselves very variously. The humblest member of a group felt that he could make things happen: he sensed an efficacy in himself. The victim of blows and stripes and physical compulsions realized powers in his discipliners. The wisdom of the wise, the persuasive eloquence of the orator, and perhaps the charm of the women, appealed as powers, just as the strength of the wrestler or the swiftness of the runner appealed. Psychical contact could impress this sense of personal efficacies as effectively as physical violence or hold, and perhaps more effectively. In the quail before the fiercely uttered curse, as one man sensed the animus of another, may perhaps be seen one source of one central conviction in magic, the conviction that the curse was very like a bullet. Personal efficacies, physically and psychically sensed in the powers of others or in self-efficacies, were things in the days when magic prevailed. Herman Melville describes in Moby Dick how a harpoon flung at a whale in Java seas pierced the animal near the tail. When the whale was slain after many years, off the Cape of Blanco, that harpoon, travelling like a needle through the body of a man, had moved forty feet to reach the hump. An "evil magic" can still travel in an Australian native like that harpoon in the luckless whale. "If 384</page><page sequence="7">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE a man has a headache," Baldwin Spencer tells us, "it is an evil magic that has got inside him, and he will wear, in some tribes, his wife's head rings, so that the magic may pass into them, and be thrown away with them into the bush." Primitive man thought of the magic entering into him as he probably thought of heat entering into glowing iron, or as Melville thought of the harpoon in the whale. We ourselves, as Reid once remarked, "speak of pain coming and going, and removing from one place to another," and this was once more literal than it is now. Wishes and ideas masqueraded as things, even as travelling and projectile things, very freely in the early world. The tired savage, as Sir James Frazer explains, will still rub a stone on his body to receive his weariness, and throw his fatigue away in the stone. The scape-goat principle of sending sins away on bearers, like wood on hireling's backs, was constantly applied in primitive days, as is fully recorded in Frazer's ample pages. In many magical practices a victim could be as literally handled by his name as he could be swung over a cliff by his arm. To be numbered has often been to be endangered, for numbers were as genuinely handles as names or arms or knobs. When pains and sins and names and numbers were things that could travel or fix in men human efficacies were like unto them. They had also the dynamism of the force as well as the thinghood of the spear. Physical forces had all the gusto of things when Bosco- vitch in the eighteenth century and Faraday in the nineteenth resolved atoms into them. Human efficacies had all that gusto, too, when human minds first felt the dynamism around them. Human desires and strivings and purposes were sensed as efficacies and appreciated as thing-like forces. The profound Egyptian belief in the powers of words, that Budge has noted, embodied this sense of dynamic human efficacies. The central magical fact has often been discerned in the spell or incantation. The charm pours an efficacy into the net, or onto the spear, an efficacy that is conceived with all the dynamism of a force and all the thinghood of a sluice. The central magical fact is the dispersal, the travels, the fixings, the appropriations, and the workings of powerful forces. Countless rites, practices, and beliefs have diversified this central principle, and have often almost buried it. These forces often suggest their derivation from human efficacies and seem always to have had this ultimate derivation. The human being himself, his social group, his fellows or alien groups, were the first great models of dynamism. Animism presumed personal agents that repeated the models; magical forces were the personal efficacies consolidated into dynamic things. The human person was the first pet model of the human mind for con? ceiving agencies. Animism or anthropomorphism modelled the agents on the complete person; the efficacies within the man became 385</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES pervasive magical forces. The primitive Idea of the Soul presumed a dynamic man within the immediately visible person. The interior soul was typically an inner dynamic repetition of the outer human being, though it might be etherealized or attenuated, or dwarfed, and though it was, on many occasions, conceived in some animal form. Such souls, either on temporary travels or permanently exiled from their bodies, peopled the world with spirits. Human efficacies, analogously dispersed, stocked the world with magical forces. The Ila-speaking Peoples of Northern Rhodesia believe in vaguely defined forces that are pervasive and dangerous, though "the secret of manipulation" can harness them. Some people become taboo because they have been in contact with these dangerous forces. The Seton Sioux believe in a creative power, and in the sun as its most important manifestation. Among the North American Indians there is a widely dispersed belief in an impersonal reservoir of power. The Hurons call this power Orenda; other tribes call it Manitou or Wakonda, or by other names. The Egyptian "blke, the nearest English equivalent of which is magical power," seems to resemble Orenda or its congeners in being a generalization of effi? cacies into a singly conceived force. The Bafioie of the Bantus seems to be an analogous African gathering of efficacies under one principle. Variously activated items may derive either from the plurally conceived forces or from the singly conceived power. Fetishes instrumentally embody forces derived from Bafiote. Differences of power are associated with varying proportions of Orenda. If the individual and collective totems of the Omaha tribe are particular forms of Wakan, as Durkheim says, a plurality of efficacies has apparently been unified into a single manifesting power. The Ila- speaking Peoples are content with a plurality of forces; Orenda and its congeners, with the same monocentric insistence that identi? fies many causes of decay with one "tooth of time," gather many efficacies into one. The Melanesian Mana, described many years ago by Codrington, introduced these generalized concepts of pervading forces to anthro? pologists, and will probably remain the classical example. Mana, as Codrington described it, has the characteristics of the magical power. It is pre-eminently a force; it is also like material, for it "can be conveyed in almost anything." It is pervasive, for "it is present in the atmosphere of life." It is "not fixed in anything," but it does attach "itself to persons and to things." This attaching displays the essential magical procedure of appropriating powers, for Mana operates when attached and manifests in its results. Mana, according to Codrington, is the agent in "everything which is beyond the ordinary power of man" or in events "outside the common processes of nature": "wizards, doctors, weather-mongers, 386</page><page sequence="9">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE prophets, diviners, dreamers . . . work by this power." Thus Mana, the gathered unity of magical forces, expresses, in its compre? hensive powers, the wide range of magical efficacy. Magical forces tend to be confined in actual operation to more exceptional achieve- ments, as Mana suggests, but the universal New Guinea charming of nets, or Australian ceremonies to promote animal multiplication, and other practices, also tend to bring the magical power into the whole circuit of human life, or even of nature. Mana indexes its origin by its uniform connection with directive persons, such as men or spirits. The Bantu Bafiote is explicit indeed on the germ of these magical forces in personal efficacies if, as Hart- land remarked, it represents the remaining vital energy of an ancient ruler. Orenda, which, according to Hartland, clings about persons and things, perhaps disguises its ultimate origin more. Concepts that grow out of the sense of human efficacies may grow misleadingly away from their origins. The oak would seem very remote from its real source to one who had never seen an acorn, and the real origin of Mana concepts might be very obscure if we could not perceive the pet model of the human mind. Lovejoy has argued that Mana emphasizes the supernormal more than the efficacious, and such impersonal powers do seem to present themselves too much as extra potencies to be genuinely derived from human efficacies themselves. It seems curious that a wizard who is assisted into wizardship by Mana should be helped by a brother of his own efficacy. A note by Sainte-Beuve on David's method with Napoleon is here a useful hint. Napoleon actually rode the most difficult passes on a mule, but David made him scale the Great Saint Bernard on a fiery steed. Manas, and magical forces, are a heightened sense of human efficacies. Such heightening is too familiar to be refused here, for idealizations, such as the vast strength of Herakles, that operate everywhere, would operate here. Primitive men did not deliberately single out human efficacies to heighten them into magical forces, but sensed human efficacies are the highly probable sources of that great manifestation by the spontaneous movements of the human mind in the forces of magic and the Manas of the world. Striking powers in men, and perhaps great displays of power in nature, such as the sweeping hurricane, would help to heighten the sense of powerful forces that was born from a sense of the powers of man himself. Pointing the magic dart seems to Malinowski to be probably the most widely spread magical method. The ghost-shooter is a Banks Islands variety of this. The sorcerer mixes leaves, dead men's bones, and other ingredients into a slender bamboo. When he takes his thumb from the open end the evil influence strikes at his victim. A dead man's bone, that is pointed at the victim, is a usual weapon in Australia, or a pointing stick may be jerked towards the man who 387</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES is to be killed. The magic dart proper, whatever its form, dispenses with the deference to natural sequences of the spear that is thrown as well as charmed, or of the charmed net that is also spread, and relies on sheer efficacy. When the Australian native jerks the stick towards his victim, or lays the bone to point to him, he usually sings efficacy into the magic dart. In this magical method efficacy is usually poured into the deadly dart by a charm or spell. Spells themselves may be sufficient, or very nearly so: the Koromake of Easter Island killed enemies by casting them, and the invocations of the Magi were said to make the earth endure. This power of the spell intimates the vivid sense of human efficacies that manifests in magical forces. It intimates that confidence in the power of human wishes themselves which Freud notes in primitive men. For primitive man, Hartland remarked, personal will and Orenda are the fount of all causation. Orenda, or Mana, is the elaborated sense of personal efficacies. The effects of this primary sense intimate the vivid reali? zation of power in human volitions as well as in the human efficacies more concretely manifested in physical strength or moral ascendancy. Magic darts do kill. An Australian native died when he knew that a sung bone had been pointed at him. Baldwin Spencer, who knew many native tribes of Australia well, says that "You have only to teil a native that he is the victim of evil magic and he succumbs at once and can only be cured by the exercise of counter magic." The ghost-shooter, according to Rivers, can kill in two days. The same power of suggestion is fully exemplified by Sir James Frazer. This extraordinary f aith-killing has a double significance: it kept magic alive because magical forces did kill, and it intimates the origin of magical powers in an almost incredibly heightened sense of human efficacies. The pointing of the magic dart defers to nature's ordained routines at one point; the charmed spear defers more completely by being thrown as well as aimed. The efficacy in the magic dart may defer still more if it is conceived as an in visible or subtle missile. The curse may defer to mechanical laws if it is a spiritual bullet. Some writers would sympathize with Emerson's characterization of magic as a deep presentiment of the powers of science. According to Hobson, magic shares with science a distinction from animism by recognizing uniformities. Sir Alfred Lyall discerned the dim notion of cause and effect, that necessary basis of all reasoning and experience, in the vagaries of magic. "The physics of the savage," as Bastian called magic, suggests a primary erratic science. The "defined procedure" of conveying Mana must not, however, obscure Whewell's recog? nition that magic fails to perceive natural causation. The mysterious- ness and awe that tend to surround magical agencies hint at the primary sense of power. The charmed spear, that kills because it is 388</page><page sequence="11">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE charmed and not because it it pointed, aimed, and thrown, is a significant magical instance. Deference to the determinate sequence of events is incidental to magic. It is exacted by nature: the magic dart can kill a man because he fears it, but it cannot kill a distant deer. Malinowski calls magic a "pseudo-science." It often does simulate dependence upon inadequately understood causal sequences because many things will not happen unless nature's ordained routines are sufficiently obeyed. The stereotyping of rites, and the frequent importance of correct procedure, suggest that magic, like rational science, depends upon determinate sequences, though these may be eccentrically conceived. The charmed spear or net, however, hints at the truth. The emphasis of magic falls upon coercive power, and that power essentially makes things happen. Such a sheerly naked efficacy can only be an ideal limit in a world of determinately connected events. There must be deference to these, and much deference there is even in wild magic. Even spells and charms, in which the sheer efficacy of magical forces is often very naked, often defer to the recognition of natural sequences, real or imagined. The magical force, however, is essentially a power that makes things happen, and, through all its multitudinous forms, it seems to originate in an extravagantly heightened sense of personal efficacy. For Sir James Frazer "magic is a spurious system of natural law." The idea of "impersonal forces" acting by "fixed and invariable laws" had not "fully dawned or darkened" upon primitive minds, but the "germ of the idea" was present both in the business of life and "in magic art." This ignores the essential magical emphasis on sheer coercive power. Deference to "fixed and invariable laws" is exacted from magic, it is constantly mingled into it, and it is, from time to time, prominent in magical procedure, but it is not its essence. Albertus Magnus, in the thirteenth century, told a story of the basalisk that Pliny had told in the first. The basalisk traditionally slew by gazing at its victim: as Bacon afterwards said, it killed "by aspect." A corpse slain by the stare of a basalisk lay on the ground. A horseman rode up to the corpse, touched it with his spear, and fell dead. The characteristics of the magical efficacy are visible in the death-dealing power of the basalisk's stare, in its transmission through the spear, and in its fatal communication to the horseman. The magical efficacy is essentially a thing-like force. The transition from magic to rationalized procedure, or to that completely rationalized inquiry which we call science, is too obvious to miss. The venerable doctrine identified man, the microcosm, with a miniature of that macrocosm, the world: man's body, as Donne expressed it, was God's recapitulation of nature. The charmed spear is the system of magic in miniature, the recapitulation of magical procedure, more truly than man is a recapitulation of the world. 389</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES Drop the charm, and rationalized procedure remains: the transition from magic to science diverted the emphasis from coercive forces to the determinate sequence of events. It was a long process, and a fluctuating one. It began in very early days when magical efficacies deferred to nature's ordained routines. It received an impetus when Greek science grew and flourished. It waned again when the great Greek intellectual effort had reached its acme in the centuries just before Christ. At the end of the seventeenth century, as Berthelot has said, the rational science that had first appeared in Greece was finally domiciled in Europe. The story of these vicissitudes is too long to teil, but one significant seventeenth-century episode can illustrate the transition. When Van Helmont died in 1644 he had had some strange experi? ences. These included the metamorphosis of mercury into gold. He had received the "fourth part of a grain" of "The Stone of Philosophers" that was coloured like saffron, but weighty and shining like powdered glass. An adept had also given him half one grain of the Powder of Projection. He had prepared quicksilver, heated it in a crucible, projected his potent powder upon it, and congealed the mercury into gold. His "fourth part of a grain" had transmuted "eight ounces of quicksilver." These transmutations were achieved in private, but several large companies had watched him transmute quicksilver into gold by potent powders. The alchemist tried to concentrate transmuting power into his Powder of Projection. He sought this transmuting power in laboratory art, in the might of the stars, in the purity of his life, and even in invocation or prayer. The great transmuting might of the meagre grains suggests the coercive might of the magical force. The magical origins of alchemy, though it had rational origins too, support the suggestion. The furnace and the acid are great rationalizers, for they compel deference to natural sequences, but they had not weaned alchemy from illusory magical efficacies when Van Helmont threw his saffron powder on to the shining quicksilver. When Van Helmont was dead, and Descartes had imposed the Mechanical Philosophy upon the seventeenth century after his own death in 1650, the Honourable Robert Boyle lingered uncertainly over the reputed transmutations of Van Helmont. The Belgian was a mystic, and the laboratory seemed even to the pious Boyle to be no place for such visits from angels as the Helmontians described. Yet Van Helmont was a sound observer, he was too honest to lie, and the records seemed to bear the stamp of truth. If the quicksilver did become gold, Boyle reflected, a mechanical explanation was possible. Within the gurgling mercury, corpuscles rolled lazily over one another like smooth little polished globes. The crucible quickened these sluggish motions. There might be a tumult of minute rapid 390</page><page sequence="13">FROM MAGIC TO SCIENCE particles within the apparently quiescent powder. The crucible would also quicken these motions. At the moment of projection the particles of the powder might throw themselves fiercely on the more sedate corpuscles of mercury. Some quicksilver corpuscles might be knocked into the air; the rest might clash violently together. The impacts might weld them together, and the compacted mass might be gold. Boyle laid down no law, but nature had great transforming powers, and the internal corpuscular fury of the powder might spank gold out of the quicksilver. In Boyle's rationalization of Van Helmont the magical efficacy is clearly replaced by presumed natural sequences, and the transition from magic to science is visible. The episode is significant all through. Boyle himself tried to emulate Van Helmont: the old magical method survived in its rationalized form. Then the quest for the Powder of Projection steadily melted out of the serious scientific tradition. Magic has often been killed by kindness: science coddles it in the rationalized scheme until it becomes feeble and dies. The transition from magic to science has proceeded differently at different points, but it has always transferred an emphasis from coercive might to the determinate sequence of events. 391</page></plain_text>
