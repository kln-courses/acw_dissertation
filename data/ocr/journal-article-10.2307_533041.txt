MIssIssAGUA PLACE-NAMES. - Many of the Mississagua place-names in the midland region of Ontario are of interest to students of etymology and of folk-lore. Lake Scugog was called by the Mississaguas Pdiazjakoshkiwad- kbng (low, muddy place), a name which refers to the shallow muddy state of the lake before the government dams were erected. Sczugog, the name by which white people know the lake, is no doubt a corruption of the Indian appellation. Stony Lake is known to the Indians as Kdzwadkoikong (place of the moss), from wakon, a.sort of (edible) moss that grows upon stones. Mud or Chemung Lake (which latter means " place of canoes ") is known to the Mississaguas as Shishzbadtiweyong (place of many inlets and outlets with junctions). The chief river of this region is the Ot/zabce, which has preserved its Indian appellation toidabi (mouth-water), a name it received most probably on account of the broad expanse of Rice Lake into which it flows, and whence it again emerges under the name of the Trent. A lake- like expansion of this river near the village of Lakefield is named Katchzi- wanui-k (steep place where the water falls down). The Indians call Rice Lake (so named from the wild-rice in which it abounds) Pdmzzaskwtlaybng (across prairies), because, years ago, on looking across the lake from the Indian camping-place, one could see as it were rolling prairies. Sturgeon Lake is a translation of Ndama Sdagdkon, the Indian name (sadgikon, or asdgdikon, being the term applied to an inland, land-locked lake). To Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Superior, and sometimes to Lake Simcoe, the name Ktchigdming (big water) is applied. To the Mississaguas and Ojeb- ways Lake Superior is also known as Otchizwe Kitc/hig,aming (the big- water of the Ojebways), its northern shores having been the region whence the Ojebways migrated to the east. Lake Simcoe has another Indian name, the origin of which is as follows: Long ago some of the Missis- saguas used to live on points of land in the lake (near what is now Beaver- ton); no other people dwelt there then. One day a man heard a voice, as if some one were calling (ashuniiun) a dog. It was a calm day, and al- though he looked carefully he could see no one, but only heard the voice. So the people named the lake AshkiniOng (the place of the calling). The Narrows of Lake Simcoe are called Miidjikadming (the fish-fence, place where stakes are put in to stop fish), a name which recalls Champlain's notice of this peculiar contrivance. At the Narrows lived, according to Mississagua belief, the mishibishi or " lion," to propitiate which sacrifices of tobacco, etc., were often made. To a place in the Scugog River where "rapids " are, the name Pot&amp;goning was applied, and the town of Lindsay there situated is still known to the Indians as Pottdgoning. A. F C/hamber-lain. ISRAELITE AND INDIAN.1 -The student of anthropology is confronted by two possible theories to account for the correspondences of custom and in- vention which are everywhere found in the track of his investigations. At 1 Israelite and Indian, a Parallel in Planes of Culture. By Garrick Mallery. Address of the Vice-President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section H. Anthropology.

Colonel Mallery, as the title of his address indicates, has addressed him- self to this problem, confining the study, however, to two peoples, the Israelites and the Indians, making this selection because his audience was presumed to be familiar with the illustrations drawn from either source. As the Indians never reached a stage of nationality, were only in excep- tional cases truly sedentary, and had not acquired the art of writing, the author has confined his comparison chiefly to the corresponding culture period, or about the time of the commencement of the reign of kings. The author cites an astonishing number of Indian customs as practically identical with those of the ancient Israelites, and adds many new and remarkable examples to the long list furnished by Adair, Smith, and others. The interpretation placed by him on such parallelism is, however, quite different from that of the older school, and is, in effect, that such similari- ties merely indicate that in their mental construction the races of the world are akin, and that, given the same plane of culture and similar conditions of environment, the results of mentality are everywhere similar. This, in fact, is the chief lesson of his essay, and is strengthened and enforced by every line of argument. The religious cult of the North American Indian has proved an interest- ing study from the earliest date of civilized contact. Thoroughly imbued with the idea that no people could be so degraded as not to recognize God or a Supreme Deity in some form or other, most of the early missionaries were able to discover in the belief of the Indians at least a glimmering of their own God, and popularly, the "Manito " or "Great Spirit" of the Indians is an accepted fact. Summarizing the ideas of both Israelite and Indian, Colonel Mallery's conclusion is, not that both, but that neither of them, entertained the belief. Both had many gods, or spirits of good and evil, of great and little power. But in the case of the Israelite the idea of a supreme God was not reached until a period later than the one consid- ered, while the Indian never attained it until the Christian's God was forced upon him. The more advanced of the Indian tribes showed evidences of transition from zo6theism to physitheism; and the same is true of the Israelites at the latter part of the period selected, though in a somewhat higher degree. As the gods of neither were anthropomorphic, neither worshiped idols in human form. The totemic system prevailed among both peoples, and in both it was connected with zo6theism. Both peoples believed in a passage of the spirit to the home of their ancestors; but the Israelites had a sheol, for which there was no exact correspondent among the Indians. The religious prac- tices of both were intimately connected with their earlier sociology, and were strikingly similar. The parallelisms between the two peoples in connection with the subjects</page><page sequence="3">76 yournal of American Folk-Lore. of pollution and purification have strongly impressed all students, but these are explained by Colonel Mallery, probably correctly, on principles best expressed by the Polynesian word "tabu." In considering the subject of sacrifice, many curious customs of the Indians are cited, such as their offerings of maize and animals of the chase, and, in times of danger, the offering of tobacco and other prized objects to the angry wvater spirits. The offering of firstfruits, or of the firstborn, by the Semites, is declared to have its analogue in the Indian green-corn dance, which was a ceremony of thanksgiving for the firstfruits of the earth, and in the sacrifice with fire of the first animal killed by the young hunter. The latter practice, however, may be said to be exceptional, since the first animal killed by the youth was usually made the occasion of a feast, to which all the relatives were invited, and at which speeches of congratulation and encouragement were made. Most curious of all the examples cited, however, is the Iroquoian feast of the white dog, the animal before being burned being loaded with the re- pentings of the people symbolized by strings of wampum. The origin of the Christian Sabbath in connection with the feast of the new moon is dwelt upon, and connected in origin with the Indian cere- monies of the new and full moon, farther than which Indian usage did not extend. Circumcision, which has been regarded as a practice peculiar to the Israelite, is shown to be of world-wide distribution and practiced by several Indian tribes. The totemic or clan system of the Indian is cited in explanation of much that has been mystical in the sociology of the Israelites. The salient fea- tures of this system in both peoples consist of the division of the people into tribes and clans with special rules of government, adoption, protection, punishment, property, descent, and marriage. The prohibition in regard to certain foods is explained on the totemic principle, in which, originally, no part of the animal taken as the clan totem, and usually assumed to be its ancestor, could be eaten otherwise than sac- ramentally. It may be doubted, however, if the principle here enunciated holds true of all the Indian tribes, however universal its application may be among the Israelites. Certain of the Indian tribes, the Apaches for in- stance, are restrained from eating certain animals, as fish and bears, which are not known to be connected in any way with their totemic system. Colonel Mallery's denial that either the Israelites or Indians are a pecul- iar people is not likely to prove acceptable to either race. The latter are as tenacious of that belief as the former. But a classification by culture will not only be more useful, but also more intelligible, than one by races. Altogether, the address of Colonel Mallery is a notable one, and contains the results of much more laborious research and riper scholarship than such addresses are wont to have. H. W.
