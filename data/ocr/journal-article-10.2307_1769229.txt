The possibilities of such commensurateness were seen to be broad and flexible: there was a myriad of ways in which conscious- ness and nature could learn to fit together in fruitful struggle. Words- worth's metaphor of a marriage, with its attendant consummation and creation, is perhaps the best known image for this exquisite fitting. But Wordsworth's was a middle way, giving equivalent weight to each partner in the relationship. The high argument in the "Preface" to The Excursion is an exercise in parity, its main point the creative efficiency that comes from interlocking the powers of mind and world. Blake, Wordsworth's most active antagonist in these matters, insisted that the outward creation was a hindrance to the mind as it ascended to its en- compassing vision of eternity.1 Yet Blake, on his way to a fourfold vision, could still look at a thistle and see it both as a thistle and as a gray old man, finding analogies in the minutely natural.2 Thus, though he usually found nature to be an impediment to the fullest perception, there were times when Blake could make use of the world in order to transcend it, beginning with a wild flower and ending with heaven. 1 From Blake's annotations to Wordsworth's poems in The Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David Erdman (Garden City, N. Y., 1965), p. 655. 2 See the poem beginning "With happiness stretched across the hills" in Blake's letter to Thomas Butts, November 22, 1802, Erdman ed., p. 692. Compare the poem in the letter to Butts of October 2, 1800 (Erdman ed., pp. 683-84), where Blake has a vision of nature transformed into its true, anthropomorphic status: that imaginative process is actually very different from Blake's use of correspondences, since in the latter nature is utilized but does not change its ontological qualities. 193</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE "Auguries of Innocence," for example, is a horde of correspondences in which nature is repeatedly transformed into the matter of the imagi- nation. Other writers did the same thing in different ways, drawing on nature's infinite capacity to supply images which men could use to understand other modes of being. At the beginning of Novalis' Die Lehrlinge zu Sais nature is presented as a Chiffernschrift, a cipher-writ- ing or hieroglyphics whose meaning can be read in stones, eggshells, the lights of heaven, and even iron filings (Feilspiine) around magnets. This is, of course, the book of nature, and the components of nature are characters which men learn to read for supernatural meaning. As in Blake's "Auguries" nature is seen primarily as source material for figures and symbols. But Novalis is more in awe of nature than Blake is, and the key to this wonder-writing, its grammar, yields itself to most men only occasionally and then merely in transitory intuitions. The nature described at this point in Novalis' book is stubborn and resistant. Though it is there to be used by the mind, only the rare man of extraor- dinary insight can join its individual parts into a sentence of universal meaning. Still, Novalis' fragmentary book is designed to present not just this one mode of relation to nature, favored though it may be, but a myriad of alternatives. Other possibilities offer themselves almost immediately. At the opposite extreme from Blake-that is, at the other end of the spectrum of commensurateness-is the speaker in Novalis' book who proposes that the most perfect encounter with nature occurs when one blends oneself with all natural beings, feeling one's way, so to speak, into the center of their natural selves.3 In such modes conscious- ness is empathic, obsessed with Einfiihlung. The result, as Novalis' speaker argues, is an unparalleled awareness from within of the multi- plicity of things as well as their palpable, individual particularity. The variety of these instances of the engagement of the Romantic self with the world shows that the available modes of engagement are not single and simple but manifold and complex. Consciousness and nature, it appears, can be antagonists as well as partners, and sometimes both at once. There is no definite mode but a spectrum of them, going from a contest in which nature is used primarily to illustrate the affairs of the mind to a convergence in which consciousness may choose to blend with the universe or with another being. In a single passage in Die Lehrlinge zu Sais Novalis runs over the entire spectrum from one end to the other, beginning with the humanizing of nature by the mind, moving to a balanced I-Thou relationship, and ending with a thorough submission of the self to the world that it faces: "Driickt nicht die ganze Natur so 3 Novalis, Die Lehrlinge zu Sais in Schriften, ed.

Wird nicht der Fels ein eigentiimliches Du, eben wenn ich ihn anrede ? Und was bin ich anders als der Strom, wenn ich wehmiitig in seine Wellen hinabschaue, und die Gedanken in seinem Gleiten verliere ?"4 The speaker at this point in the book does not seem to recognize that these are actually very different versions of the con- tract of the mind with nature, and that the versions are never entirely compatible. Other Romantics were more sensitive to the differences and what they implied. Indeed, some of the most skilled practitioners of Romantic consciousness could range over the entire spectrum, experi- menting with all the ways of fitting together the mind and the world. Some went so far as to look for modes of accommodation between the extreme ends of the spectrum. From one point of view the order of relationships can be seen as admirably adaptable and not fixed. It could be as flexible as one chose to make it. From still another point of view the relationships can be used to create typologies, so that ways of meet- ing with nature tell us something about forms of the Romantic person- ality as well as diverse attitudes toward society, the ideal and the uses of poetry. The poet who considers the submission of self to be the most rewarding form of imaginative experience will most likely prefer a kind of poetry which plays down the doings of the authorial consciousness. His opposite number at the other end of the spectrum would undoubt- edly opt for an epic of the self over an objective narrative in which all the action is externalized. Keats, speaking of Hunt and Wordsworth, wrote that he preferred grandeur and merit which are "uncontaminated and unobtrusive."5 In Book One of The Prelude Wordsworth records how he mulled over the possibilities for an English epic at the end of the eighteenth century and pondered a variety of foreign and domestic choices before he settled for the history of his own mind. The practi- tioners of Romantic consciousness offered no unified solution to the question of what they deemed best within themselves, what they wanted most of all to honor and protect. They agreed only on the importance of the fact of consciousness itself. After that there was only divergence. Of course, the emphasis upon the importance of consciousness can come about from a variety of causes. In the case of Emerson, for ex- ample, it is the business of the mind to convert the details of nature into analogies, that is, to look at the world and uncover what there is in it that can tell men something about themselves. Emerson's essay on 4 Kluckhohn and Samuel ed., p. 100. 5 Letter of February 3, 1818, to John Hamilton Reynolds in The Letters of Johd Keats. 1814-1821, ed.

They are able to cooperate so effectively because nature is there to be used by the mind. In itself nature is nothing, with no meaningful existence out- side of its relation to man. Blake, in the Proverbs of Hell, had insisted that "where man is not nature is barren."6 Emerson's phrasing in his essay is similar: "All the facts in natural history taken by themselves, have no value, but are barren like a single sex. But marry it to human history, and it is full of life."7 Once we grow aware that "there seems to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms" and that "the visible creation is the terminus or the circumference of the invisible world" then the patterns of potential relationship between man and nature become evident (p. 22). Nature is there as a series of words to be read, not for their own sake but as the language of God; and that language, like all ancient modes of speech, is essentially figurative. As Emerson expressed it in a journal entry, "every natural fact is trivial until it becomes symbolical or moral."8 The language of nature, in Emerson as in Novalis and occasionally in Blake, is a system of corre- spondences between the visible and invisible worlds. To put it differently, the laws of God are objectified in one way in the laws of nature and in another in the laws of nature's superior, the order of the human mind. The active consciousness finds out very quickly that it can learn something about itself through nature because "the laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face to face in a glass ... The axioms of physics translate the law of ethics" (p. 21). When man learns that "the smallest weight may be made to lift the greatest" he has achieved a spiritual insight as well as a physical one (p. 21). This doc- trine of nature as tool and the mind as technician is basic to Emersonian transcendentalism, and versions of that relationship appear everywhere in his work. Both man and nature are at their best in such relationships, their roles carefully defined, their relative strengths always in view. "The world," he says in Nature, "is a remoter and inferior incarnation of God, a projection of God in the unconscious" (p. 38). The mind, on the other hand, is the imitation and imitator of God, the most complete expression of transcendental perfection available on earth.

In this passage the things of nature add up to a "Sanskrit cipher," i.e., a variation of the metaphor of hieroglyphics. 196</page><page sequence="5">NATURE AND THE ROMANTIC MIND task of the mind is to turn the elements of nature into correspondences, it follows that the purpose, indeed the destiny, of unconscious nature is to be transformed into consciousness. Clearly, the highest use of nature is as material through which consciousness can seek to fulfill itself: "Nature is made to conspire with spirit to emancipate us" (p. 30). But obviously nature too is emancipated in the process because if it is transformed into consciousness it becomes something higher than itself, rising (so to speak) in the chain of being. An artifact of the mind is always superior to a fact of nature. Nature benefits in this process, then, because-and insofar as-it is useful. In this essay and through most of his works Emerson sketches a conspiratorial, anthropocentric universe in which every element contributes to the proper business of man, the recognition of spirit in the world. Of course, since the mind is itself spirit, a fragment answering to the overall spirit which is at the center and everywhere, what the mind recognizes in nature is actually an aspect of itself. Ultimately, then, nature serves man as a most subtle instrument through which he can reach the highest forms of self-recognition. Emersonian transcendentalism is as remarkable for its faith in the mind as it is for its lack of palpable contact with the materials that the mind turns into consciousness. The nature that he loves and uses is ordinarily abstract and nebulous, its features generalized, with no sense of fine detail. This combination of confidence and imprecision raises at least the suspicion that those two elements are inseparable in Emerson's work, that he might have been more unsettled if he were able to feel and render the physical world with all the finesse and incisiveness of Thoreau. Had he done so he might have arrived at the same awareness that Thoreau eventually reached, with some surprise and discomfort: nature is resistant to the degree that it is specific and concrete. The more precisely it is grasped, the more difficult it is to hold on to and know. Diversity is a product of detail, and it is problematical, to say the least, to legislate for such variety. One could apply to Emerson the strictures of Coleridge on some poems by Bowles: "There reigns thro' all the blank verse poems such a perpetual trick of moralising every thing- which is very well, occasionally-but never to see or describe any inter- esting appearance in nature, without connecting it by dim analogies with the moral world, proves faintness of Impression."9 There is little aware- ness in Emerson that nature could be stubborn, that there might be room for ambivalence, that some of the analogies one drew out of nature might be darker and less gratifying than one would like. The mode he preaches 9 Letter of September 10, 1802, to William Sotheby in Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Earl Leslie Griggs (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956), II, 864. 197</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE assumes a serenely imposing consciousness, its desires clear, its ability to attain them dependent only on the will to use the mind. The Emersonian way is obviously an extreme, one of the most pre- carious positions that can be taken on the spectrum in which mind and nature are measured against one another. For each mode on the spec- trum there were different desires and varying dangers, even though the exponents of any one mode were more likely to be aware of the hazards in the other modes than those in their own. Romanticism was nothing if not risky, but the chances Keats took were not at all like the gambles undertaken by Rousseau. The dangers varied because, for each mode, there was a different conception of the relative strengths of mind and nature. On one side there was the possibility that mind, in its creative intensity, would submerge and even scorn the nature on which it worked. On the other was the possibility that nature, in its overwhelming par- ticularity, would swallow up consciousness, at least for a while. What- ever the emphasis the balance was always tenuous and difficult to, sus- tain. Blake feared nature so much that he rarely used it, knowing that the world which furnished him wild flowers and grains of sand for analogy was also the unholy Tirzah, "Mother of [his] Mortal part" who closed his "Tongue in senseless clay."10 Instances of such dilemmas are everywhere, and they run the gamut from the hybris of Holderlin's Empedokles to Wordsworth's uneasiness over giving himself completely to the nature that he loved. Empedokles' hybris is classical in name and in occasional references to the gods, but the components of his hybris were contemporary in Holderlin's time. His arrogance was directed toward nature, and the powers that he wielded were derived from the mind's ability to find words for a nature that remains inarticulate unless human consciousness gives it speech: "ihr ehret mich... und thuet recht daran; / Denn stum ist die Natur."1 He named the unknown, as he says, giving life and youth to the hesitant world. Empedokles' closest counterpart is not classical Greek but Romantic English: his actions prefigure by several years the assertion in Coleridge's Dejection ode that nature lives only insofar as the mind chooses to give it life: "0 Lady! we receive but what we give, / And in our life alone does Nature live." As Empedokles puts it: "und todt / Erschiene der Boden wenn Einer nicht / De6 wartete, lebenerwekend, / Und mein ist das Feld" (p. 95). Empedokles is a mythicized version of this form of enlivening consciousness. And it is no coincidence that he has the same problem as 10 "To Tirzah" in Erdman ed., p. 30.

In a magnificent passage of oblique self-analysis Empedokles parodies his disciple's admiration of the powers of mind by showing what an unregenerate mind thinks it can do when it is unchecked by any respect for the materials on which it is working: Was ware denn der Himmel und das Meer Und Inseln und Gestirn, und was vor Augen Den Menschen alles liegt, was war es, DiB todte Saitenspiel, gab' ich ihm Ton Und Sprach' und Seele nicht? was sind Die GStter und ihr Geist, wenn ich sie nicht Verkiindige ? nun! sage, wer bin ich ? (Page 109) By this time Empedokles has been shattered by his separation from nature, and by the resultant death-like speechlessness of his spirit ("Al- lein zu seyn / Und ohne G6tter, ist der Tod," p. 108). Thus, his mockery of his disciple Pausanias is actually a melancholy acknowledgement of the arrogance of consciousness which had caused his own moral isola- tion. Once he had been heedless, and thought himself superior to nature rather than its necessary partner. Now the fruitfulness of their relation- ship has turned into an ashy wasteland; and only he can experience that spiritual desert because the arrogance of consciousness is a failing that only the strong in mind can possess. Pausanias, who sees the power but not the hazards, calls Empedokles the "Hochgeniigsame" (p. 114). Panthea, another admirer, speaks of Empedokles' mind as a law unto itself ("nur sein Geist ihm Gesez," p. 112). The mind, we see, is its own place; and if we have heard that assertion before we know also that moral self-sufficiency was not just the bane of Milton's Satan but the enticing and sticky labyrinth that his Romantic descendants had to avoid as one of the perils in their quest for the fullest self-consciousness. Keats had a name for a British version of this flaunting of one's pri- vate consciousness: he called it "the wordsworthian or egotistical sub- lime."'2 Such sublimity is an imposition of the poet's self upon the reader; or, in another perspective, an interposition of the self between the reader and the material. Egotistical sublimity is so fascinated with the content and contours of the mind that it presents the reader with more of the consciousness that works on nature than it does of nature itself. This kind of poet knows too much and displays all of his knowl- edge, filling his poems with all manner of dazzling private speculations 12 Letter of October 27, 1818, to Richard Woodhouse in Letters, Rollins ed., I, 387. 199</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE about matters which he ought to treat with more objectivity and mod- esty. As Keats puts it, poetry should not startle or amaze with itself but with its subject.13 The sublimity Keats describes is dramatized in H61- derlin's Der Tod des Empedokles. The prophet who found names for the inarticulate succumbs to the temptations of the imperious intellect: in his pride over the powers of mind he renounces the necessary respect for his materials. Like the self-obsessed poet whom Keats set up as a foil to both Shakespeare and himself, Empedokles did not permit nature to share in his independence of being but demanded that it exist largely to serve his own interests, primarily the gratification of the arrogance of consciousness. In fact, that haughtiness is what makes this hero con- temporary, a fit partner for Keats's Wordsworth and other modern egotists. After all, these were current dangers, peculiar to the prevailing understanding of the contract between consciousness and nature. And they were dangers less apparent to those who were prone to them than to those, such as Keats, who were on the other side of the spectrum and saw the likes of Hblderlin's Empedokles or the persona in Wordsworth's poems as symptomatic of modern egotism. Keats's attack, as we know, was largely inspired by the lectures of Hazlitt, who analyzed the phenomenon of egotistical sublimity with a subtlety and cogency that are still unparalleled. Hazlitt's chief quarry was also Wordsworth, but some of his most suggestive evidence comes out of several passages in which he compares Wordsworth and Rous- seau. In an essay "On the Character of Rousseau," published in The Round Table, Hazlitt argues that the dominating faculty of Rousseau's mind was "the most intense consciousness of his own existence," a con- clusion which is perfectly consonant with our own present-day readings of Rousseau.14 As a result of this consciousness Rousseau could not look out at the world with empathy but, instead, "filled all objects with him- self" (p. 89). Hazlitt treats Wordsworth as Rousseau's exact counter- part, differing only because the latter wrote in prose. However, that difference does lead to some curious discrepancies in their ways of ap- proaching the fascinating minutiae of nature, and those discrepancies put Rousseau and Wordsworth further apart than Hazlitt seems pre- pared to acknowledge. Though both "wind their own being round what- ever object occurs to them" Rousseau comes to the things of nature in perfect frankness, with an open stress on the facets of his ego: he "in- terests you in certain objects by interesting you in himself" (p. 92). Wordsworth, on the other hand, appears to be focusing on the object 13 Letter of February 3, 1818, to John Hamilton Reynolds in Letters, Rollins ed., I, 224. 14 The Complete Works of William Haslitt, ed. P. P. Howe (London, 1930), IV, 88. Further references to this essay are in the text. 200</page><page sequence="9">NATURE AND THE ROMANTIC MIND itself, the linnet's nest or the song of the cuckoo; but in fact "Mr. Wordsworth would persuade you that the most insignificant objects are interesting in themselves, because he is interested in them" (p. 92). In this passage Hazlitt argues (with unstated but dubious premises) that the prose writer can express his feelings more directly than the poet, whose medium compels him to fill his poems with objects so that he can give his feelings symbolic embodiment. Rousseau is therefore the more candid and straightforward of the two, while Wordsworth's world is not as evenly divided between nature and the mind as he would appear to claim. Yet both, Hazlitt concludes, are among the greatest egotists that we know. It would be as difficult to improve on some of Hazlitt's insights on these matters as it would be to ignore the polemical level of his analysis. He looked at Rousseau and Wordsworth from the other end of the spec- trum, the one fascinated by the exploits of the sympathetic conscious- ness. Here was the place for Einfiihlung, what Novalis saw as an inborn capacity (Naturorgan) for the most intimate understanding of other creatures, what Hazlitt and others saw as the outstanding characteristic of Shakespeare's imagination.15 This too was a form of Romantic en- gagement with the world, another mode of experimenting with the com- mensurateness of mind and nature. The Keatsian version was "negative capability," i.e., the capacity for remaining in uncertainties and doubts rather than imposing fixities upon experience; in terms of the sympa- thetic consciousness it meant the capacity for withholding one's own assertiveness so as to be filled with the essential content of another's being.16 With Shakespeare, the great model for the Romantics, it meant that (in Hazlitt's words) "he had only to think of anything in order to become that thing, with all the circumstances belonging to it."17 Such sympathy, according to many of its supporters, was the hallmark of genius, the superior imagination. The energies of self were as active and intense for the sympathetic consciousness as they were for the egotistical sublime, but the latter practiced the imposition of self on the world while the sympathetic consciousness sought only the submission of self. To put it differently, the proponents of sympathy knew that when consciousness entered the recesses of another's being it was necessarily intrusive, im- pinging where only the inhabitant could properly belong. Yet this was an intrusion with no trace of arrogance or aggressiveness.

Howe (London, 1930), V, 48. 201</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE thetic consciousness wanted nothing more than to assent to the validity of another being; it had no desire to assert the superiority of its own. The purpose of sympathy was not dominance but knowledge. Most of all it wanted to know what it felt like to be a Desdemona or-in Keats's fine example-a sparrow pecking around in the gravel outside one's window. It has been argued that Keats's claim to knowledge of the sparrow is no more than a good guess which can never be verified.18 He could never give us, it is said, the indisputable inner reality of that or any bird, though there are many flashes of intuition in his poems and letters which seem to open up the inner contours of another life. But even if some of Keats's claims are rejected there is still the massive instance of Shakespeare, whose guesses as to what it is to be a human being such as Desdemona or Iago are verified by us in our acceptance of the reality of those characters. Rousseau could never achieve that kind of knowl- edge of others because he would rather explore with elaborate precision what it felt like to be looking at Desdemona or the sparrow, and how such looking entwined with and affirmed his private sentiment de 1'exis- tence. And that was exactly the problem. Sympathy sought out the intri- cacies of the object, not the subject; yet consciousness could know another being only to the degree that it ignored or played down the operations of its own perceiving mechanisms. It was very difficult, as Keats knew well, to resist the tug of one's private consciousness: he said in a letter to Benjamin Bailey that "I am not old enough or magnani- mous enough to annihilate self."19 Such extinction of the personality required a generosity of the spirit (negative capability has to be seen as a gift of the self) that even the most willing could not come by readily. And there were those who would always be most ungenerous with them- selves under any circumstances because the processes of consciousness could be a source of precious insight as well as of considerable pleasure. The modern egotists, it was argued, came to nature through the medi- ation of a self which they found so fascinating that, in the end, they never got to nature at all. What should have been a conduit became, instead, a seductive detour. In an incisive passage from Uber naive und senti- mentalische Dichtung Schiller recalls his first acquaintance with Shake- 18 See e.g., Newell F. Ford, "Keats, Empathy, and 'The Poetical Character,"' SP, 45 (1948), 477-90, where Ford speaks of empathy as a projection of the self into the object, which would mean that Keats is reading himself, not the sparrow. That interpretation makes negative capability a form of the pathetic fallacy. See also footnote three in Walter Jackson Bate, "The Sympathetic Imagination in Eighteenth-Century English Criticism," ELH, 12 (1945), 145, where Bate rejects this sort of reading for one that is more corroborative of Keats's assertions. The skepticism in regard to Keats seems unwarranted: when he puts the sympathetic consciousness to work in his poems the imaginative conviction he produces is often remarkable. 19 Letter of June 10, 1818, to Benjamin Bailey in Letters, Rollins ed., I, 292. 202</page><page sequence="11">NATURE AND THE ROMANTIC MIND speare, and how his initial readings of the dramatist had been wrong- headed in premise and approach: "Durch die Bekanntschaft mit neuern Poeten verleitet, in dem Werke den Dichter zuerst aufzusuchen, seinem Herzen zu begegnen, mit ihm gemeinschaftlich iiber seinen Gegenstand zu reflektiren; kurz, das Objekt in dem Subjekt anzuschauen, war es mir unertraglich, daB der Poet sich hier gar nirgends fassen lieB und mir nirgends Rede stehen wollte."20 Shakespeare was simply not that kind of poet but another, the kind who treats objects with dry truth and is wholly possessed by them. Schiller's typologies of the naive and senti- mental, which derive in great part from such distinctions, are actually elaborate and somewhat fuzzy speculations on the commensurateness of mind and nature in the modern world. His egotists are the sentimental poets, melancholy, uncomfortable, and self-obsessed; but they are quite unlike the Rousseau or Wordsworth portrayed by Hazlitt because the sentimental poets are too distanced from nature to be able to dominate or obliterate it through the energies of consciousness. They share all the pain and self-awareness of Holderlin's Empedokles but without the philosopher-poet's compensating option of self-immolation in order to achieve the desired reunion. The sentimental poets provide the requisite counterweight to the Keatsian myth of a smug, self-satisfied egotistical sublimity: they want the intimate knowledge available only to the naive consciousness but they are prisoners, often unwitting, within the con- fines of their private selves. It is obvious that we must accept some of the strictures of Keats and Hazlitt but that we ought to do so only with a good deal of qualification. Indeed, qualifications are apparent even in their own arguments: though they were aware that the Romantic fascination with the mind could turn into an overweening self-consciousness these British proponents of sympathy put forth comments that are radically ambivalent in what they say about the sublime egos of Rousseau and Wordsworth. Hazlitt recog- nized all the feats of mind that emerged from Rousseau's interminable self-concern even as he deplored the mode of egotism which made those feats possible. And Hazlitt acknowledged several times that Words- worth's limitations ("He can give only the fine tones of thought, drawn from his mind by accident or nature") led to poems as good as Resolu- tion and Independence.21 Keats stood in awe of Wordsworth though he knew how insufferably priggish Wordsworth could be. And Keats also admitted that the burden of other selves upon his own could be discom- forting, even overwhelming: "I wish I could say Tom was any better. 20 Schillers Werke, Nationalausgabe, Philosophische Schriften, Erster Teil, ed.

It was a commonplace, in certain circles, to identify the most complete forms of genius with the capacity for empathic projection. The greatest poets, it was argued, know how to efface themselves so thoroughly that the perceiver dis- appears into the material he is shaping and the object shines forth as it is in itself, in all its own harmony and radiance. Coleridge (whose theo- ries covered, at one time or another, nearly every variant in the relation- ship of consciousness and nature) had a precise understanding of the exploits which the sympathetic consciousness was capable of perform- ing. Yet, though he esteemed its capacities, and even identified them with certain characteristics of poetic genius, Coleridge could still recog- nize what there was to be said in favor of the poet who was always con- spicuously perceptible in his work. In a letter to William Sotheby of July 13, 1802, Coleridge acknowledges the extraordinary difficulty of achieving empathy: "to send ourselves out of ourselves, to think our- selves in to the Thoughts and Feelings of Beings in circumstances wholly &amp; strangely different from our own / hoc labor, hoc opus / and who has atchieved it? Perhaps only Shakespere."23 Later, in chapter fifteen of the Biographia Literaria, he lists among the qualities of Shake- speare's (i.e., poetic) genius "the utter aloofness of the poet's own feel- ings, from those of which he is at once the painter and the analyst."24 But by the time of the late comments recorded in Table Talk Coleridge had learned to give due not only to Shakespeare, who was never re- flected in his work, but also to Milton who, as Coleridge asserts, is present "in every line of the Paradise Lost."25 All of Milton's charac- ters, Coleridge says later, are only extensions of himself, with nothing like independent life. Yet Coleridge does not consider this a drawback but simply the way Milton works, and that way has a remarkable value of its own which looks forward to Emerson: "it is a sense of this intense egotism that gives me the greatest pleasure in reading Milton's works. The egotism of such a man is a revelation of spirit."26 With Keats the acts of the sympathetic imagination were too new and potent for him to have reached the seasoned judiciousness of Coleridge's 22 Letter of September 21, 1818, to Charles Wentworth Dilke in Letters, Rollins ed., I, 368-69.

He considered anything less than full self-effacement to be a lesser form of the imagination; and sometimes, it seemed, the lesser form was really no kind of imagination at all. In his letter that introduces the phrase "the wordsworthian or egotistical sublime" Keats specifically distinguishes such sublimity from "the poetical Character itself ... that sort of which, if I am anything, I am a Member."27 Keats's eagerness to clarify his admiration of Shakespeare as well as his own instincts for empathic comprehension led him to toss any other kind of imaginative knowing into an abyss of self-admiration. Only empathy, it seems, is poetic. Of course Keats could not hold to this extravagance for more than one letter but his attitude does show how positions on the scale of commensurateness can freeze into fixed typologies. In Uber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung Schiller fell into a somewhat more subtle version of this dilemma in his attempts to clarify naivete, the senti- mental, and the qualities of poetic genius. Near the beginning of the essay he simply identifies the characteristics of the naive with the ele- ments that make for genius: "Naiv muB jedes wahre Genie seyn, oder es ist keines. Seine Naivetat allein macht es zum Genie."28 So much, it would appear, for the sentimental poet's pretensions to talent, since in his deepest self he is radically different from the naive. As the essay moves on, however, Schiller finds more confidence in himself and more value in the sentimental mode, which he persistently identifies with the dominant contemporary personality. The naive is perfect in its way but that way is finite, bound within the things of this world. The naive poet can be absorbed by objects, but he has no awareness of the ideal which can be intuited, if not achieved, by his self-obsessed sentimental counter- part. By the final section of the essay Schiller's early identification of the naive with genius has given way to an elaboration of the limits of the naive as well as its obvious value. Now he has come to see the problems in the naive's unreflectiveness, in its heavy dependence upon external experience, and in the necessary circumscription of its activities. And in a more confident gesture toward an equilibrium of the imagination he begins to speak of the characteristics and difficulties of the sentimental genius, which by this point in the essay appears not only to exist but to be of equal status with the naive, though obviously different in kind. Because it rejects limitations (which it must do in order to break loose and reach for the ideal), the sentimental genius encounters the danger of going beyond the possibilities of idealized human nature to an ex- treme of enthusiasm. Its problems are therefore the counter image of 27 Letter of October 27, 1818, to Richard Woodhouse, Letters, Rollins ed., I, 386-87. 28 Benno von Wiese ed., p. 424. 205</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE those faced by the naive.29 Schiller's attempt at a final equilibrium is not quite as poised as the position Coleridge eventually reached because Schiller was caught in a mixture of conflicting inclinations and could end only in ambivalence. But the movement of his essay as a whole is dialectical, perhaps deliberately so. That shows his treatise to be as much an exercise in self-understanding as an exploration of the implications of poetic types. It was obvious that the more sophisticated endeavors to identify genius with the sympathetic imagination could lead to some intricate attempts at balance. In some cases they even led to an understanding that the limitations and values at one end of the spectrum were the mirror image of the limitations and values at the other. Schiller came to see that if one end of the spectrum faces all the well-defined hazards of modern egotism the other runs the serious risk of limiting itself too ex- clusively to the world around it. Keats, who had rudimentary glimpses of some of these problems, found the benefits of the mode he practiced to be worth all the difficulties. But the activities of the sympathetic imagination were not for everyone, which meant, in effect, that its judg- ment about liabilities was not always accepted. What was embarrass- ingly egotistical for Keats was normal and correct for Emerson: the mode in which the mind merges with nature in Emerson's essay is frankly utilitarian, with nature there to serve the mind as source mate- rial for man's study of his own destiny. Whereas Keats had made his human consciousness submissive so as to take part in the sparrow's existence, Emerson announced in Nature that "the instincts of the ant are very unimportant considered as the ant's; but the moment a ray of relation is seen to extend from it to man ... then all its habits ... become sublime."30 Emerson was not interested in reducing the primacy of the self but in affirming it, and that affirmation included some of the bluntest statements available about the dominance of the mind over its materials. In fact, it was the passivity inherent in every form of the submissive consciousness that made it suspect to those who took stock of other needs of the mind. The loss of identity which a total absorption in nature or other selves entailed could be distinctly upsetting, as even Keats was led to admit. Despite the occasional identification of the highest genius with the sympathetic imagination, it was just as characteristic of Ro- manticism to fear the dissolution of self through a thorough immersion in things as it was to praise the capacity for identifying fully with the strange self inside another's being. To lose oneself, even temporarily, meant to let go of the ultimate point of stability in a churning world, the 29 Ibid., p. 481. 30 Spiller and Ferguson ed., p. 19. 206</page><page sequence="15">NATURE AND THE ROMANTIC MIND final asylum which Wordsworth called "that last place of refuge-my own soul."31 It was no petty egotism that caused a poet like the Lamar- tine of Le Lac to cherish the core of his perceiving consciousness. That core was the functional center of his own being, and its dissolution, however brief, was too high a price to offer for the privilege of knowing another's being. Further, without a firm hold on that center of self the Romantic poet would lose out on one of his most characteristic opportunities. It is surely part of the genius of the Romantic lyric that it can meditate on the processes of consciousness in poems which are themselves examples of those processes at work. One need not turn to Resolution and Inde- pendence or Le Lac to see that happening. Keats himself was one of the most gifted interpreters of the efforts of the Romantic mind to grasp and control experience. His Ode to a Nightingale offers a brilliant mimicry of the movements of consciousness, talking of and rendering those move- ments in an intricate patterning which is a model of Romantic self- awareness. There is nothing in the poem about empathic projection but there is a good deal about the struggles of the mind to reach accommo- dation with a nature that will not give easily of itself. What seems to be a triumph of the mind, a penetration to the dark center of the nightin- gale's grove, turns out to be no more than a probable illusion. He does not have to fight off the impress of other selves but to grope his way toward them, and few Romantic poems have been more effective in rendering this intricate hunt and its sudden collapse. In a way Keats's ode is a piece of self-rebuttal, what must have seemed a harsh but neces- sary perspective to the excitement of his moments of empathy. It can stand as the requisite balance to all the polemics for the sympathetic consciousness. Clearly there was both good and bad at each end of the spectrum of commensurateness. It was inevitable, then, that between the two ends there would be varying forms of arbitration, attempts to make use of the benefits of each extreme while avoiding their obvious difficulties. We have seen how Wordsworth extolled the marriage of mind and nature as the coalescence of equals, while Novalis argued for an I-Thou rela- tionship which gave due respect to both sides. For a theorist like Fried- rich Schlegel and a practitioner like Byron the alternative to the ex- tremes took the form of a special mode, the dialectical alternation of chaos and order, breakup and renewal, which was Romantic irony.32 31 The Prelude, ed. Ernest de Selincourt, 2nd ed., rev. Helen Darbishire (Ox- ford: Clarendon Press, 1959), Bk. X, line 415. 32 My remarks here are not meant to present anything like a complete picture of Romantic irony but to show how significant elements within the mode echo characteristics and concerns of other Romantic forms of the engagement of mind 207</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE The basic supposition of the Romantic ironist is that there is a chaos at the center of things, an anarchy which usually can be identified with the simmering complexity and diversity of experience. Opposed to that chaos, and poised to make use of it, is the mind of man, the creative imagination which imposes order upon lawlessness and discord. Schlegel saw chaos as pure potential. He argues in one of his fragments that "nur diejenige Verworrenheit ist ein Chaos, aus der eine Welt entspringen kann."33 And he asserts in a neighboring fragment that it is only the ironist who understands the whole meaning of that potential: "Ironie ist klares BewuBtsein der ewigen Agilitat, des unendlich vollen Chaos."34 But of course he is conscious of more than chaos alone. The ironist has to be extraordinarily sensitive to the totality of experience, not simply to one force or element within it. As Schlegel says in another fragment: "zur Vielseitigkeit geh6rt nicht allein ein weitumfassendes System, sondern auch Sinn fur das Chaos aul3erhalb desselben, wie zur Men- schheit der Sinn fur ein Jenseits der Menschheit."35 Byron was much less comfortable with chaos than Schlegel was though he too affirmed the dialectic of dissolution and regeneration, what Schlegel called the "steten Wechsel von Selbstsch6pfung und Selbstvernichtung."36 The long history of the Byronic hero shows that he sees men as more often victims of chaos than creative manipulators of it, though his greatest poem reveals a successful way out of that dilemma. Byron's imagination of chaos was most fully realized in Don Juan. His poem continually posits an ordered world of social harmony and balanced stanzas, and continually breaks up that order through the disruptive passions of its protagonists and the wandering attention of the poem's narrator. Con- fusion succeeds to order and then order to confusion in an extraordinary dialectic which is arguably one of the greatest triumphs of the Romantic imagination. Schlegel admired Sterne's ability to create an image of chaos, seeming to give in to the overwhelming drive of the world's com- and nature. The literature on Romantic irony is vast and includes a considerable variety of interpretations of the phenomenon. The most comprehensive study is that of Ingrid Strohschneider-Kohrs, Die romantische Ironie in Theorie und Gestal- tung (Tiibingen, 1960).

Byron does the same, assenting to the pressures of chaotic impulses and then triumphing over those pressures through the organizing skills of his creative imagination. But Byron's moments of triumph are themselves perpetually countered by an overwhelming sense that the world's chaos is catching up with him, that the order he has created will once again be subsumed within the flux of things. A Romantic ironist like Byron never denies chaos, nor does he claim that he can ever finally win out over it. He is always fully aware of his own insufficiencies. His job, as he knows, is to show both order and its opposite in action. Yet Romantic irony is more than a reproduction of the incessant swing from chaos to order and back again which the ironist sees as the underlying pattern of cosmic activity. The very existence of the mode is also a subtle assertion of the capacities of the mind to im- personate the forces which are threatening its own order. In every case the Romantic ironist reproduces the disorder of chaos in his work; but this is actually an artful semblance of disorder, a controlled mimicry of the anarchy which is always out there threatening to swallow up all the fixities of human experience. Because his mode is radically paradoxical, combining contraries in a counterfeit of confusion, the Romantic ironist can have it all ways at once. He acknowledges that the swarming com- plexity of the world can absorb him and his order, unsettling him and compelling him to submit; yet his acknowledgment appears within a comprehensive system of artifice-his novel or his poem-that he has himself created. Thus, he reproduces the disturbing alternation of breakup and renewal, disorder and order, within a structure shaped and dominated by his own mind. Eventually we see that there is not only a return to order within the work but an ultimate, encompassing order which is the work itself. Romantic irony accedes to chaos, as it must; but even as it does so it affirms the genuine, if impermanent, sovereignty of consciousness. Schlegel liked to point out that the ironist transcends everything limited, even the shifting processes of experience in which he is compelled to take part. The Romantic ironist accomplishes this tran- cendence through a complex and dazzling mode which is a masterpiece of inventive coalescence. The structure of Romantic irony is peculiarly fitted for such coales- cence because it is dialectical, containing within itself some of the essen- tial functions of both the dominating and submissive consciousnesses. In its occasional surrender to chaos it is overwhelmed and absorbed by the restless destiny of the world, losing itself momentarily through total immersion. Irony is to that degree negatively capable. It remains open 209</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE to complexity and uncertainty, and such openness, as Keats argued, is an essential characteristic of the receptive consciousness.37 Further, it recognizes that the order of self we have created can be dissolved, for a while, in the teeming disorder of experience which seeks to swallow up all other identities in its own. But of course Romantic irony is also sub- lime to the degree that it counters the thrusts of disorder with instances of the mind's ability to give shape to the scattered fragments of experi- ence: whenever the form of Don Juan crumbles into a comic mass of absurd digressions and startling rhymes the narrator pulls together the pieces of his poem and asserts the control of consciousness once again. This capacity for self-recovery is one of the defining activities of Romantic irony. With the distancing it obviously requires, the ironist's talent for the retrieval of self is one of the characteristics which dis- tinguish him from the man of negative capability and the naive poet. The latter are thoroughly immersed in the nature they illuminate, allied with it if not fully identified with it. But for the ironist to complete his dialectic he must exercise an element within himself that is necessarily and permanently estranged from experience. That element sees the world as forever unlike the mind, and it therefore compels the ironist to be separate and aloof from all things, insofar as he is able. Moreover, it is part of the ironist's business to do something with his alienation. The isolation of self that infuses Byron's poems from the earliest stages of his career is established in lesser work such as the Eastern Tales, and is given a fuller though still frustrating development in Manfred and Cain. In Don Juan, however, Byron learned how to put his isolation to extraordinary creative use: he transformed it into the requisite distanc- ing of the ironic poet, the creator who must always keep alive within himself a stratum of personality that remains purely objective. With Byron as the model for this process one can look back at Schiller's senti- mental poet, who is compulsively and unwillingly estranged from ex- perience, and see how the sentimental figure is the first step toward the triumph of alienation recorded in Byron's finest poem. But again one has to realize that the ironist's alienation, however necessary, is insuffi- cient by itself: in order to be the complete imitator of experience as he reads it, he must practice humility as well. The essentials of his mode require him to have an enormous appetite for variety. After all, his ironic work contains a number of dialectical patterns: not only does he mimic the movement from order to chaos but he also imitates the dialectic of the mind's relation to nature, the oscillation from dominance to submission. The ironist is therefore a consummate manager of an- titheses. He is alternately detached and assimilated, aloof and involved, 37Letter of December 21 (27?), 1817, to George and Tom Keats, Letters, Rollins ed., I, 193-94. 210</page><page sequence="19">NATURE AND THE ROMANTIC MIND sublimely capable of manipulating the disruptive forces which he can never really conquer. If he sees human achievements as necessarily in- complete (the return of disorder shows how provisional those achieve- ments are) he can at least offer an accomplished instance of their suc- cess as well as their incompleteness. Don Juan is one of those instances, a genuine triumph even though an ambiguous one. Of course there are limitations within irony too. The ironist is prob- ably not capable of empathy as long as he chooses to act as an ironist. When he assumes a submissive relation to experience that is only be- cause experience compels him to do so. He is not interested in explor- ing the selves of others but in supporting the ordering skills of his own self. Like all practitioners of the active consciousness the ironist has to go without the rare and moving knowledge of what it feels like to have another kind of being. That is a considerable loss. But in compensation the Romantic ironist has that unusual capacity for self-retrieval to which I have referred, the ability to pull himself out of the moments of chaos and back into a system of order. And if empathy is outside of the range of his interests he compensates for that loss with a detached and severely objective knowledge of what he is in himself. In fact, his talent for self- distancing carries him so far that he can mock his own pretensions to order and upset the very applecart which he has been carefully putting together. Schlegel sees this impulse toward self-parody as creative caprice, one of the wittiest and most effective tools of the Romantic ironist. In one of his aphorisms he speaks of irony as being "die freieste aller Lizenzen, denn durch sie setzt man sich fiber sich selbst weg."38 In another he points out the presence in certain poems of "eine wirklich transzendentale Buffonerie. Im Innern, die Stimmung, welche alles iibersieht, und sich fiber alles Bedingte unendlich erhebt, auch fiber eigne Kunst, Tugend, oder Genialitat."39 With this ability to undercut his own claims to an ultimate order the Romantic ironist protects him- self against overweening self-confidence. He knows that such pride of self is the trap which exposes the most extreme forms of the egotistical sublime. Byron at his self-mocking best is an effective antidote to Emer- son at his most confident and pretentious. The enemies of Romantic irony argued that the ironist is excessively destructive, giving credence to nothing and questioning all assertions about order, even his own. This attack does have a certain accuracy: the Romantic ironist agrees with the man of negative capability in prefer- ring to remain in uncertainties and doubts. He distrusts all reverence of the absolute because fixities are necessarily suspect in a world where 38 Lyceum, Kritische Fragmente, No. 108, Eichner ed., p. 160. 39 Ibid., No. 42, Eichner ed., p. 152. 211</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE chaos is always ready to break out and usually does. The ironist is too aware of the uncertainties in things to trust what Keats called "con- sequitive reasoning."40 Systematization must take its opposite into ac- count or it can only falsify. Yet there is, finally, one value which the ironist always respects, and that is the capacity of the mind to under- stand and reproduce the dialectic of self-creation and self-destruction, the alternation of order and chaos which informs the central patterns of experience. Though he emphasizes chance and the sporadic, wit and chaos, illusion and human insignificance, he ultimately affirms the mag- nificent capacity of mind to prevail, however tenuously, over that in- significance. Romantic irony, as we finally see, is self-consciousness aware of both the proximity of chaos and the strength of artifice. In its ability to weave contradictory tendencies of Romantic consciousness into an inclusive dialectical whole this form of irony proves itself to be an unusually felicitous mode of association. In a curious way it seems to hold the whole spectrum of possibilities within itself. From our per- spective, and for those reasons, Romantic irony remains one of the most subtle and paradoxical experiments the Romantics ever made in their probings of the commensurateness of mind and nature.
