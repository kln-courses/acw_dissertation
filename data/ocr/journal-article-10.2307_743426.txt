<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fellowship of Men that Die: the Legacy ofAlbert Camus Daniel Stern Michel de Montaigne wore around his neck, we are told, a medallion on which was written que sais-je? - "what do I know?" - the ultimate skeptic's question. Centuries later, Albert Camus took that question and moved it forward into a kind of philosophical action. In The Myth of Sisyphus he wrote, almost as an informing motto: "I want to know if I can live with what I know and only with that." It is a line which has haunted me for many years since the English translation first arrived. It defines the extraordinary nature of the intellectual adventure that was Camus's brief and indispensable career. These two men, Montaigne and Camus, shared a kind of absolute, terrestrial, physical honesty - their refusal to shelter their minds and souls in sentimental, religious, or metaphysical solution (comforts, if you will), asking instead: what do I know, and can I live with that? This kind of intellectual courage is a particular hallmark of Camus - a writer self- trained in philosophical thought, primarily an artist. His two book- length essays, The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel, explored ultimate questions - the validity of suicide and of murder - with a wealth of lit- erary and philosophical speculation. Works of rich association, of poetic allusion, they sang a song of the body, of the earth. In The Myth of Sisyphus he attempted to set forth nothing less than a new relationship of human beings to the universe. In The Rebel he presented a new view of history, its illusions and evils. What they were not was a systematic phi- losophy in any classical sense. In the place of system Camus offered something, to my mind, per- haps more important: lucidity. In Camus's hands the classic French value of lucidite becomes an organizing principle closer to ultimate hon- esty of thought and experience than it is to the simple idea of clarity. Hence, the clarion call of the line I began with: "I want to know if I can live with what I know and only with that." In that same book, he also remarks: "It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be 183</page><page sequence="2">logical to the bitter end." Camus wrote three novels: The Stranger, The Plague, and The Fall. The Stranger is the fictional objective correlative of the ideas put forth in The Myth ofSisyphus. The Plague performs the same function vis ' vis The Rebel. Rarely has an artist matched works of abstract thought with major fictional works so elegantly. I use the term elegant in the sense that a mathematical or logical solution to a problem may be elegant. But I am not going to deal so much with the art of Camus as a novelist, short story writer, and playwright. I want to deal more directly with his address to our situation as human beings on the earth and in history. Camus's experience as a member of the French underground in World War II played an important part in the formulation of his thought: the essential notion of the Absurd. (Though his diaries from 1939 on suggest that his thinking about the Absurd somewhat predated his involvement in the Resistance.) He would not be the first to see in the sudden, vio- lent death of an innocent the absurdity of our situation, that is, the gap between our longings and the reality of our condition. We are all inno- cent at the moment of death - but how much more innocent did the murdered seem under the Nazi occupation of France? It is difficult to explain to people who were not around immediate- ly after World War II the excitement that filled the air as news of what was happening in a small section of the left bank of Paris, known as St. Germaine des Pres, filtered in; news that a few first-rate minds were reconceiving the nature of human existence - or at least making a thrilling claim in that direction. It is hard to imagine an equivalent time when a philosophical movement made the rounds from articles in Life magazine, to jokes and parodies in night clubs and plays. Photographs of Sartre and de Beauvoir at La Coupole (not quite the Bogart and Bacall of existentialism but with their own charm), Camus at the Deux Magots, rugged, handsome, with a cigarette usually pasted to his lower lip. I remember a comic play in which a group of existen- tialists sit drinking Pernod in a smoke-filled boite and one character says, "Some day I'm going to commit an act, a big fat act!" It was actu- ally pleasant for serious thought to be parodied and misunderstood. At least it was in the limelight. In 1946 Camus, already famous because of the immense success of The Stranger, came to the United States. During this visit he spoke at 184</page><page sequence="3">Columbia University's McMillan theater, introduced by his translator, Justin O'Brien. Camus chose to speak of the experiences of his genera- tion, a generation that was twenty years old the year Hitler took power. He ended by speaking of the four years of occupation and secret struggle. He told a story of one of his comrades in Lyons who was being inter- rogated by the Gestapo. In a previous session the prisoner's ears had been torn to shreds and this time the German officer asked, "Can you hear me, now?" He told another story. In Greece, a woman was asked by a German officer which one of her three sons taken as hostage should be spared; she chose the eldest because he had a family, thereby condemning the other two to death, as the German officer had intended. I repeat this not because we need another reiteration of Holocaust horrors - though they were, of course, quite new to Camus's audience in the New York of 1946 - but because Camus then summed up thus, going to the root as usual: the problem was, he said, "Hegel's detestable principle that man is made for history." What must we do?, Camus was asked. He replied: "We must call things by their right names and realize that we allow for the killing of mil- lions of people each time we acquiesce in certain lines of thought." Calling things by their right names may have been an encoded reference to his conflict with Sartre over the discovery of the forced labor camps in the Soviet Union, what we now call the Gulag. Sartre did not wish to reveal this because it might be detrimental to the left wing cause. Camus insisted on telling what had been learned simply because it was true. Equally important, to my mind, is his next sentence: "We must rid the world of terror, put politics back in its rightful place, a secondary one.... [Emphasis added] There is in Europe today," Camus continued, "a generation which takes the view that whoever puts his trust in the human condition is a madman, and whoever despairs of political events is a coward.... But I believe whenever one judges France or any other country or question in terms of power, one sustains a concept of man that logically leads to his mutilation." The rightful place of politics a secondary one? Give up the central- ity of power as means of judgment? In the world at large and in the uni- versities of America this will seem a bitterly retrograde idea to many. Of course, the above was a speech - rhetoric, meaningful, heartfelt, but still rhetoric. In one sense rhetoric can always be seen as a branch of the 185</page><page sequence="4">politics it despises. What may convince us is a combination of reason and poetry. How does the writer whose friend's ears were torn off by the Gestapo move to a position of putting politics back in its rightful place, a sec- ondary one? One key here is the phrase "putting one's trust in the human condition." That will not be as simple as it may sound because, for Camus, that condition is the Absurd. So, having mentioned the key phrase, the Absurd, a phrase which is used and misused mostly in ways having little to do with the kind of thought Camus was proposing, let me plunge into that notion. First, however, the moment is also ripe for my disclaimer. I am cer- tainly not a philosopher nor do I make any claim to original thought here. I am a writer, only, with a passion to see an idea, a feeling about life, restored to the central place I believe it deserves. In fact, I have availed myself of far more than the usual treasure of quotations, partly because one of my goals is to bring to the fore some of Camus's most profoundly important conceptions, conceptions which have been languishing in the background far too long. I have no rights in this matter except those claimed by love and respect. The thought I am going to explore affected me in a permanent way, beginning when I was a young man and continuing over the years. That it has not done so the world at large in the significant way it deserves is, in a way, my theme. In representing the idea of the Absurd, I will speak as much of feel- ings as of ideas - as does Camus. In fact, confronted by the Absurd, the line between the two blurs, hopelessly and perhaps fruitfully. There will be two tasks here. The first is to look at a universe in which God is not God; the second, to look at a world in which history is not God. One of the finest descriptions of the Absurd was written by Wallace Stevens. He wrote: "From this the poem springs. That we live in a place that is not our own.... And hard it is in spite of blazoned days." There it all is, Camus's blazoned days - the sun and sea in the Oran of his youth - and the world that is not our own, the world of The Stranger. Camus speaks in The Myth ofSisyphus (a study of the validity of sui- cide) of how, for much of our lives, we automatically invest our world with a kind of anthropomorphic familiarity. "It is, after all, our house, 186</page><page sequence="5">our neighborhood, our office, our fields, our hills, our sky over our heads. But there comes the moment," he remarks, when strangeness creeps in. Perceiving that the world is "dense," sensing to what degree a stone is foreign and irreducible to us, with what intensity nature or a land- scape can negate us. At the heart of all beauty lies some- thing inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of those trees at this very minute lose the illu- sory meaning with which we had clothed them; hence- forth, they are more remote than a lost paradise. The primitive hostility of the world rises up to face us across the millennia. [Later Camus would convert that hostili- ty to the indifference of the world.] For a second we cease to understand it, because for centuries we have understood in it solely the images and designs that we had attributed to it beforehand; because, henceforth, we lack the power to make use of that artifice, that density and strangeness of the world is absurd.... It is when the world evades us because it becomes itself again. That stage scenery masked by habit becomes again what it was. It withdraws at a distance now from us[;] that density and that strangeness of world is the absurd. These reflections, bear in mind, are presented in the course of an examination of whether suicide is ever justified. Camus's answer is "no." "It is possible," he tells us, "to live without hope. Which is not the same as despair." (Emphasis added.) Camus is acutely aware that human beings have a longing for whole- ness, for more than just a life - for what you might call a destiny. In the past, it was a belief in God that for most people could turn mere living into a destiny. But, remove the confidence in a God, remove the instinc- tive comfortable familiarity with one's world, and, as Camus puts it, "...in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, between the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity." 187</page><page sequence="6">It is interesting, after listening to this initially bleak description of the human situation, to remember that the two key words which show up over and over again in the work - not only of Camus and Sartre, but even in an earlier Christian existentialist like Kierkegaard - are freedom and happiness. Sartre's sequence of novels is called Chemins de la Liberti, "Paths to Freedom." And the word "happiness" appears again and again in Camus's work. Having begun to sketch the absurd feeling, the absurd universe, let me take us further toward the edge. In this absurd world it is not only "the inhuman beauty of the world" that causes such pain, as well as philo- sophical problems. It is the questions of God and death. And which one you're going to believe in. None of this is easy. Camus calls it thought in the desert. "In the presence of God," he tells us, there is less a problem of freedom than a problem of evil. You know the alternatives: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible for evil. Or we are free and responsible but God is not all-powerful. All the scholastic subtleties have neither added anything to, nor subtracted anything from, the acuteness of this paradox. This is why, he states, I cannot get lost in the glorification of the mere defini- tion of a notion which... eludes me as soon as it goes beyond my individual experience. I cannot understand what kind of freedom would be given me by a higher being. I have lost the sense of hierarchy. The only con- ception of freedom I can have is that of the prisoner or the individual in the midst of the state. The only one I know, personally, is freedom of thought and action. Kierkegaard says at one point, If man has no eternal consciousness, if at the bottom of everything there were merely a wild, seething force pro- ducing everything, both large and trifling, in the storm of dark passions, if the bottomless void that nothing can fill 188</page><page sequence="7">underlies everything, what would life be but despair? To which Camus replies, "This cry is not likely to stop the absurd man. Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable. If necessary," our lucid Frenchman says, "then despair. Everything considered, a deter- mined soul will always manage." This is, however, irony designed to keep us on the quest. Later he will tell us that the absurd man learns to live without appeal, without hope - which, he emphatically asserts, is not the same as despair. And he adds: "The absurd tells me there is no future. That death is in the wind blowing inevitably towards me from the future. Henceforth, this is the reason for my inner freedom." These strange forms of freedom are a specialty of Camus. Indeed, the ending of The Stranger is one illus- tration of this. In one of the most famous scenes in modern literature, Meursault, the eponymous hero, is in prison awaiting his execution the next day, for the seemingly pointless and impulsive murder of an Arab on the beach. He is visited by the Chaplain. Meursault is sullen, uncooperative. Suddenly, the Priest bursts out with: "No, no! I refuse to believe it. I'm sure you've wished there was an afterlife." Of course I had, I told him. Everybody has.... But that had no more importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very fast, or to have a better-shaped mouth. It was in the same order of things. Then he asked me how did I picture the life after the grave. I fairly bawled out at him, "A life in which I can remem- ber this life on earth. That's all I want of it." Meursault ends by actually grabbing the Chaplain around the neck and yelling at him at the top of his voice... in a sort of ecstasy of joy and rage.... He seemed so cock- sure, you see. And yet none of his certainties was worth one strand of a woman's hair.... Actually I was sure of 189</page><page sequence="8">myself, sure about everything, far surer than he; sure of my present life and of the death that was coming. That, no doubt, was all I had; but at least that certainty was something I could get my teeth into - just as it had got its teeth into me.... From the dark horizon of the future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the years that were to come. And on its way that breeze had levelled out all the ideas that people tried to foist on me.... What difference could they make to me, the deaths of others, or a mother's love, or his God, or the way a man decides to live, the fate he chooses, since one and the same fate was bound to "choose" not only me but millions of privileged people.... Him too.... As a condemned man himself, couldn't he grasp what I had meant by the dark wind blowing from the future? The jailers rescue the poor Chaplain from his grasp. Meursault falls asleep in exhaustion. "When I awoke, the stars were shining down on my face." He hears the sounds of the summer night, a steamer's siren.... People were starting a voyage to a world which had ceased to concern me forever.... I, too, felt ready to start life all over again. The great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. It made me realize I had been happy, and that I was happy still. Aside from the beauty of the language here, language that transforms ideas into experience, what we have is a dramatization of the argument found in The Myth ofSisyphus, which goes thus: At a certain point in his path the absurd man is tempted. History is not lacking in either religions or prophets, even without gods. He is asked to leap, blindly. All he can answer is that he doesn't fully understand, that it is not clear. Indeed, he does not want to do anything but what 190</page><page sequence="9">he fully understands. He is assured that this is the sin of pride, but he does not understand the notion of sin; they tell him that perhaps hell is in store for him, but he has not enough imagination to visualize that strange future; they say that he is losing immortal life, but that seems to him an idle consideration. An attempt is made to get him to admit his guilt. He feels innocent. To tell the truth that is all he feels - his irreparable innocence. This is what allows him everything. Hence, he demands that he accommodate himself to what is and to bring in nothing that is not certain. He is told that nothing is certain. But this at least is a certainty. He feels innocent and he wants to find out if it is possible to live without appeal. This is a mirror image, in a speculative essay, of what we saw take place in Meursault's prison cell. It may help us understand what might other- wise seem a merely sullen character, detached from normal human feel- ings. I think it is possible to say that no one before Camus had created a character who existed in relation to the world quite this way. In writing The Stranger, Camus took enormous risks. He went to the edge. And there arise among us, every now and then, artists and thinkers who take us to the edge - an edge many of us sense with anxiety, from which we turn away in everyday life and thought. Yet we are oddly, some- times profoundly, grateful that someone out there is taking the risk for us. The widespread admiration for Kafka tells me this is true. Proposition: Kafka is a paranoid whose vision of the world is an ele- gant freak show in its extremes of hopelessness, of the eternal tantalizing, of the yearning for and impossibility of grace, of the hopelessness of com- ing to some kind of terms with the nature of existence. In which case his millions of readers are merely voyeurs of the extreme, observing, for liter- ary entertainment, a comic horror show in which men are lost in mazes, turned into insects, beg for entrance to the Law for a lifetime and die without admittance: men who die, not like saints and not like human beings but, to quote Joseph K's last words in The Trial, "like a dog." Counter-proposition: Kafka speaks to something forever within us, something which feels lost, alienated, deprived of grace; he speaks to our deep sense of (our need for) innocence. While conventional notions of 191</page><page sequence="10">guilt are often pasted onto Kafka, I find it is his extraordinary sense of innocence that is so moving. Certainly Joseph K. never stops fighting for his case, for his innocence in the court of some theological absolute - which remains forever out of reach. Camus's purpose in examining the absurd is to affirm that the value of this earthly life is absolute - perhaps the only absolute - thus he finds suicide unjustifiable. But The Stranger was published in 1942 and was written at the beginning of World War II. Camus, Andre Malraux, and other literary comrades were risking their lives for others. In short, under the tyranny of one of the worst man-made deaths, the Nazi devas- tation, they rebelled. In the fellowship of the Resistance, Camus and his comrades lived in a world in which murder had been raised to the level of a principle; yet they cared for each other, took action against evil, and defended the innocent. This is not irrelevant. Human beings may die alone but they live with others. In the Resistance Camus began to for- mulate his notion of The Rebel. Here we anticipate the parodistic Cartesian aphorism with which he begins that ambitious work: I rebel, therefore, we exist. Let me return to that moment in New York in 1946, when Camus said: "There is in Europe today a generation which takes the view that whoever puts his trust in the human condition is a madman." But first one must agree what the human condition is. Certainly, the Chaplain and Meursault, and their millions of constituents, will never agree. But for the purposes of discussion the absurd condition just rough- ly outlined will, I hope, suffice. It has rejected the principle that individ- ual man is made for God and in doing so has broached the idea of limits. This will prove to be a guiding idea, a passion, for Camus. The road from The Myth ofSisyphus to The Rebelis one proposition: "If we decide to live, it must be because we have decided that our personal exis- tence has some positive value; if we decide to rebel," as Camus and his fel- low Resistance members did, "it must be because we have decided that a human society has some positive value. Hence: I rebel, therefore, we exist." With the Russian Revolution in mind - and its exports, Eastern Europe and China as well - Camus traces the movement of the French Revolution from its beginnings in an inspired rebellion full of the pas- sions of justice and virtue. Human nature itself was to be changed. (One can assume that Lenin, when his time came, had read Rousseau's Social 192</page><page sequence="11">Contract.) Saint Just and Robespierre both began with a commitment against capital punishment - and ended by creating the blood bath of terror and then drowned in it themselves. After the Guillotine, Napoleon and the Second Empire are waiting in the wings. But these are familiar ironies. What seems less familiar to the popu- lar mind is the fact that Rousseau was the first to justify the death penal- ty in a civil society as well as the absolute submission to the authority of the sovereign people. "It is in order not to become victim of an assassin that we consent to die if we become assassins." Rousseau creates a kind of civil faith, a religion of virtue. After which, Saint Just exclaims: "Either the virtues or the Terror." Danton was a rebel, not a revolution- ary; licentious, seeing no contradiction between the passion for women and the passion for justice. That is why he was the first major figure who had to be eliminated. All revolutions are of the Puritan faith. Every revolution in modern times has led to the reinforcement of the power of the state. According to Camus: "The prophetic dream of Marx and the over-inspired predictions of Hegel and Nietzsche ended by con- juring up, once the City of God had been razed to the ground, a rational or irrational state, in both cases founded on terror." That is, Nazi Germany and Russian and Chinese Communism. "In each case the slave begins by demanding justice and ends by wanting to wear a crown." It would have been easy for Camus to have retreated into despair or inaction. Instead, he substitutes the idea, sustained from The Myth of Sisyphus, of limits. "We know now," Camus begins his summation, "at the end of this long inquiry into rebellion and nihilism, that rebellion with no other limits but historical expediency" - even I would add in the name of ultimate justice - "signifies unlimited slavery." And to escape this fate, Camus suggests a return to the kind of rebellion that recognizes limits. In setting forth his notion that revolutions always fail because they become absolutist, frozen, and finally murderous, he calls for a continu- ous rebellion. But "rebellion" must respect the limit it discovers in itself: Revolutions quickly dispense with memory. Rebellious thought, therefore, cannot: it is a perpetual state of ten- sion. This tension is the need to examine the actions of each "revolution" large or small... to examine at each moment whether it remains faithful to its first noble 193</page><page sequence="12">promise; or has descended into a mire of tyranny, slaugh- ter and servitude. Let's return yet again to that moment in New York in 1946 and con- sider the contemporary background against which the ideas of Camus may best be reinvoked. We are living in again, as Hardy said, "the time of the breaking of nations." In our time the Thousand Year Reich, with its glorification of blood, soil, and racism, has crumbled - taking with it many millions of lives in the Holocaust and in a world war. Communism, as a utopian world view and as a giant political regime of terror, has collapsed, trailing its own bloody record of many millions of murders - and, in the wake its death, in just the last five years, the map of Europe has been torn apart and reassembled in bits and pieces, leaving yet again a trail of corpses as testimony to the value of deep political and nationalistic convictions. In addition, the rise of religious fundamentalism in country after country threatens to turn back the clock to a time when spiritual and reli- gious values could be combined with the use of political action, includ- ing terror and murder. A few years ago I was teaching a semester at Harvard and I saw some graffiti on a wall in Harvard Square: "The false Communism is dead; Now for the real Communism." And I thought, "Oh my God, they're going to do it all over again." In spite of these giant upheavals of bloody disillusionment, the belief in the primacy of politics in human affairs does not seem to have diminished one iota. It is as if we are always ready to deal only with the manifest content of each horror as a "mistake" while ignoring the primary process beneath them all. The deification of histo- ry trailing the belief in the centrality of politics in its wake. There was a Spanish Fascist General whose toast, whose battle cry, shocked the world - what he said was: Long Live Death. On the other side of that coin, at the end of his essay "Reflections on the Guillotine," Camus writes: "There will be no lasting peace either in the hearts of indi- viduals or in social customs until death is outlawed." Outlawed! Death is in command everywhere: in Europe, in Africa, and Asia - even, one by one, in the prisons of Texas, Kansas, California. One of the more egregious cases: 200,000 Rwandans killed in three weeks. And without the benefit of high technology such as gas chambers 194</page><page sequence="13">and Zyklon B. The disintegration of Europe into warring tribes has so quickly become a convention that it is hard to know how to talk about it, except as a reversion to type. There are moments when only black jokes can cap- ture the essence of historical truth. Where are Stalin and Tito now that we need them. One would think the degree of disillusionment with the political life of our time would be deep and widespread. It is not! The oceans of blood spilled with all true conviction in the name of political utopias has con- vinced few people that Camus was right when he told that audience in New York, "We must rid the world of terror, put politics back in its right- ful place, a secondary one...." I do not believe the juxtaposition of those two phrases is accidental, for to rid the world of terror, or even to diminish terror, it will be neces- sary to put politics back in a secondary place. None of these goals is simple. It is far easier to contemplate the journey toward the Absurd because it is an internal journey - a spiritual journey, if you will. But acting on terror, acting in the political arena, this is another matter. Toward the end of The Rebel, Camus writes: Whatever we may do, excess will always keep its place in the heart of man, in the place where solitude is found. We all carry within us our places of exile, our crimes and ravages. But our task is not to unleash them on the world; it is to fight them in ourselves and others. Rebellion, the secular will not to surrender, is still today at the basis of the struggle. Origin of form, source of real life, it keeps us always erect in the savage, formless move- ment of history. Even if all action proceeding from Camus's ideas should turn out to be utterly impractical, the spiritual exercise of calling things by their right names and of believing in the limits of our condition and of the possibil- ities of our actions can only be good medicine for our souls. We must not forget that it was the ideal of the ultimate just society of the working class of the world which ended in the murder of fifty million, the establish- ment of the Gulag, and the wrecking of Eastern Europe's air and water. No political movement is worth dying for, Camus tells us, unless it 195</page><page sequence="14">assures the immediate suppression of the death penalty; not worth going to prison for unless it refuses in advance to pass sentences with fixed terms - something no revolution has ever considered for a moment. Our author also gives one small example of rebellion: the Catholic prisoners in Spain (in 1950) who refuse communion because the priests of the regime have made it obligatory in certain prisons. They refuse eternal sal- vation if it must be paid for by injustice and oppression. "This irrational generosity," writes Camus, "is the generosity of rebel- lion, which unhesitatingly gives the strength of its love and without a moment's delay refuses injustice. Its merit lies in making no calculations, distributing everything it possesses to living men. That is how it is prodi- gal in its gifts to generations to come." Certainly we have had our noble rebels: Martin Luther King, Jr. sat in jails more nights than he spent visiting the White House. Ghandi and Nelson Mandela made jails their homes for decades. Rosa Parks is a grand illustration of Camus's idea that the rebel rebels not because she is asked to do something suddenly beyond the pale - it is because, mysteriously, she is asked to do the same humiliating thing, just once too often. I will ask Camus to conclude for me. The year was 1949; and what follows is in a sense a prayer, though a secular one, for what sort of world might be made from the ruins of World War II with the Holocaust behind it, still to be discovered in the giant questions it will ask about the nature of men and society, with a giant Communism still straddling the world. I believe it serves for us today as well: At this meridian of thought, the rebel rejects divinity to share in the struggles and destiny of all people; and espe- cially of the humiliated earth. We shall choose Ithaca, the faithful land, frugal and audacious thought, lucid action.... In the light the earth remains our first and last love. Our brothers are breathing under the same sky as we; justice is a living thing. Now is born that strange joy which helps one live and die and which we will never again postpone to a later time. On the sorrowing earth it is the unresting thorn, the bit- ter brew, the harsh wind off the sea, the old and new dawn. With this joy, through long struggle we shall 196</page><page sequence="15">remake the soul of our time and a world which will exclude nothing. Not even that phantom Nietzsche, who for twelve years after his downfall was continually evoked by the West as the blasted image of its loftiest knowledge and its nihilism; nor the prophet of justice without mercy [here he refers to Karl Marx] who lies, by mistake, in the unbelievers' plot at Highgate Cemetery; nor the deified mummy of the man of action in his glass coffin. All may indeed live again side by side but on condition that it is understood that they correct one another, and that a limit under the sun shall curb them all. Each tells the other he is not God; this is the end of romanticism. At this moment when each of us enters the lists anew to reconquer within history, and in spite of it, that which he owns already, the thin yields of his fields, the brief love of this earth; at this moment when at last man is born, it is time to forsake our age and its adolescent furies. The bow bends; the wood complains. At the moment of supreme tension, there will leap into flight an unswerv- ing arrow, a shaft that is inflexible and free. We shall finally learn the only original rule of life today: to learn to live and to die and, in order to be a man, to refuse to be a God. We shall choose Ithaca? The Greek ideal of "all in good measure," the Golden Mean? Shall we? Do we dare not? Shall we never again give our souls and our bodies to those who promise utopia, heavenly or earthly - but ask us to suffer while we wait? And, of course, it is so frequently the suffering of others, of the poor, of the wretched, we are asked to endure, while waiting. As Camus sums up: real generosity to the future consists in giving all to the present. Shall we not choose our common mortal humanity, living in the old chaos of the sun, dependence of day and night; the salt of the sea on our skins, squinting at the sun, irritated by and yet happy in the rain, eter- nally troubled and fulfilled by our friends, by those we love who share our mortality - each day possibly our last - and our last, forever; shall we 197</page><page sequence="16">not learn from this that men and women have one overriding reason to love one another, to take care of one another; that is, because they die - and, perhaps, forever? There is a short story by Camus about an artist struggling with the demands of his art, his family, his life. When he dies they find written on the wall one word, a word they can't quite make out. It is either solitaire or solidaire. The first means, of course, solitary; the second, solidarity. But no one can tell which it is. This essay was originally presented as the Philip C. Hallie Memorial Lecture at the College of Letters, Wesleyan University, October 12, 1994, and then at the Graduate Center of the Sorbonne in Paris, May 16, 1996. 198</page></plain_text>
