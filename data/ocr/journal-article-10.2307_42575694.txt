New York: Wittenborn and Company, 1946. 2nd edition, 1947. $2.25. Abstract ment of art modern appears art. as It the can most be seen characteristically that considerations twentieth which century lead move- up to ment of modern art. It can be seen that considerations which lead up to modern scientific philosophy, such as general semantics, also underlie abstract art. It is not surprising that abstract art is not well understood, for it involves a radical reorientation. Piet Mondrian (born Amersfoort, Holland, 1872; died New York, U.S.A., 19 44) was an outstanding exponent of this form. He was trained as a natural- istic painter, but came under the influence of cubism early in his career. Abstract art was the further development of the change in his outlook from naturalism to cubism and beyond. To Mondrian all art was a plastic expression of form and color, whatever natural objects it might seek to represent. But painting that repre- sents naturalistic objects obscures form and color - the essential elements of art; it directs the attention to the objects suggested in the painting. Mondrian con- sidered that, instead of imitating nature or painting objects, the artist should dis- cover the logic and purpose of art. Cubism abandoned verisimilitude, but it did not carry the process of giving free expression of form and color to the logical limit; therefore naturalistic allusions and hidden associations remained. As Mon- drian put it, 'Cubism did not accept the logical consequences of its own discov- eries, it was not developing abstraction toward its ultimate goal, the expression of pure reality.' Mondrian did not take for granted the conventional aspect of the world. To him, the most important aspects of reality from the artist's standpoint were rela- tions and structure that remain constant through the flux and change of objects and events. 'To create reality plastically,' he wrote, 'it is necessary to reduce natural forms to constant elements of form, and natural color to primary color.' Forms giving rise to particular objects overlie and obscure the unchanging ele- ments of experiential reality. Some painters cannot go beyond the particular form because of their subjectivism. Mondrian realized that art in any period expressed the contemporary cul- 122</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS ture. Understanding of modern art contributes to our appreciation of art of the past. It is irrelevant to judge past, art apart from the culture in which it devel- oped, or to apply" modern standards to it. But it is also misleading to judge con- temporary art apart from contemporary culture, or according to standards of the past ; but it is precisely this that usually happens. Our present-day culture is pre- dominantly scientific; the present-day world is more a man-made world than ever before, in which naturally-existing materials and forces have been greatly transformed. Consonant with these developments, the contemporary painting ceases to be subservient to the older outlook toward naturalistic forms. Although a transformation of natural forms is inevitable in all painting, the old orienta- tion is at the same time imitative. IN existing the growth objects of are science constantly we witness being the broken breakdown down to of ever the 'object.' simpler Naturally and ever existing objects are constantly being broken down to ever simpler and ever more clearly defined elements ; the elements being re-formed into the scientific objects. This human activity has developed over a long period. Modern art, too, is a historical development : it is based upon and it gains from the insight devel- oped in the art of the ages past. The cubist painters pointed out directly that all painting was composed of forms, planes, and colors. It was only a step further to discover and paint those elements in their pure form, and not as suggestive of naturalistic forms. 'Esthetic emotion is a factor in art,' wrote Mondrian. Art evokes in us the significance of life because it expresses fundamental human attitudes and orien- tation. Abstract art does not aim to evoke any particular emotion, but a general esthetic response. The technique of abstract art is determined by the critical considerations that lead up to it. Its elements must be relatively neutral, so that they do not 'show any relationship with the natural aspects of things or with any idea.' This is a continuation of the historical trend of art, from the magico-religious to the sec- ular and rational. To quote Mondrian, 'In all plastic art we observe a reduction of the natural form and color to a more or less neutral state, a relative annihila- tion of their particular expression. . . . For all art is intuitively an establishment of their beauty, that is of intrinsic reality, and not of a simple representation of men or things.' A painting is a particular, limited, and subjective expression of an artist. The abstract artist expresses the relatively universal, non-particular aspect of his ex- perience. This twofold nature of abstract painting, universal in intention and rendering but, at the same time, inevitably subjective and limited, gives it the function of expressing the diversified unity of man and nature. All art serves this purpose, but abstract art serves it in a manner most appropriate to our age. Within the field of painting, abstract art serves an educative function: it brings about the consciousness of form, by employing neutral elements of form, 123</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS and pure colors which would not trammel the clarity of form. In his maturer art Mondrian consistently avoided any forms or compositions that might have given rise to anthropomorphic or naturalistic associations, as in cubism and sur- realism. Art being essentially a matter of coherent form, purely formal or ab- stract art arouses the most direct perception and, at the same time, represents human experience in its most vital form. Abstract art can be considered as multi-dimensional abstracting. It abstracts the unchanging relations of the visual aspects of nature: volumes and planes determined by lines and colors. The critical insight developed in abstract art, the reviewer believes, parallels general semantics ; and the theory of abstract art could be regarded as part of the theory of general semantics. We formulate the well-known principle of non- identity through the study and function of human linguistic behavior. The non- identity of art with 'nature' is the core of abstract art, and the elimination of imitation and representation is a working out of that principle. It is only whenv the imitative aspects of art are eliminated that we come to recognize the human significance of art: as involving orientations, modes of adaptation, silent as- sumptions. Just as the theory of general semantics can be considered as the logic of human scientific behavior, so also abstract art can be considered as the logic of human art-behavior. Abstract art brings out the significance of the visual environment, its assumptions and implications, which we usually neglect. Ac- cording to Harry Holtzman, a foremost abstract artist of today and one who has developed a thorough formulation of its theories in general semantics termin- ology, 'Piet Mondrian's art represents the most revolutionary contribution of our time to the historical development of plastic perception in relation to reality. The vitality of his expression contains profound implications for our under- standing of the past and future, as well as of the present. . . . Abstract art in- volves a denial of the elementalistic dichotomy between science and art ; it reveals both as mutually dependent forms of behavior, expressing orientations, attitudes, assumptions, of their period/ Surindar S.
