<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eoin Corcoran describes some interesting recent discoveries in a Bord na Mona bog in County Offaly Bog enigmas Each year Bord na Mona funds an excavation and mitigation programme of archaeological works. These works are carried out with the cooperation of Bord na Mona and the heritage authorities at Duchas and the National Museum of Ireland. Over many years this work has yielded new and interesting results. A number of enigmatic finds have emerged from this season's archaeological works, conducted by Archaeological Devel opment Services Ltd (ADS), at the Bord na Mona peat fields of Cloncreen, Co. Offaly. This year the archaeological team have uncovered four large carved roundwoods. They measure 2.1m x 0.25m; 1.8m x 0.3m; 1.2m x 0.2m; and 2.2m x 0.16m. Two of these artefacts were identifed by the IAWU during last year's survey of Cloncreen Bog, and another in very fragmentary condition was recovered by the IAWU. A date of 1736-1448 cal. BC was obtained from wood associated with the recovered artefact. Three of the artefacts were found very 3 close to each other (within 10m) and appear to be associated with one or two brushwood platforms (one of them was found directly below a brushwood plat form). The fourth artefact was found Top: Artefact 2, the easternmost Above: Artefact 3, the westernmost, in situ 12 Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2003</page><page sequence="2">approximately 50m to the south-west of the other three and does not appear to be associated with any structures. All four objects are cut and carved from slightly curved roundwood (possibly alder) and have what may resemble a head at one end, with the other end worked to a rough point. Probably more significant are the notches cut down the sides of the artefacts. The notches vary in number: one has ten on one side and eleven on the other; another has ten on both sides; a third has eleven on one side while the other side has been damaged; the fourth, still under excavation, has three visible so far and they are much more widely spaced than on the other three artefacts. These cuts have been made with a metal tool, indicating that the objects date from the Bronze Age or later, and a Bronze Age origin is supported by the date obtained by the IAWU. It was thought by the excavating archae ologists that the artefacts may have stood upright, perhaps acting as markers across the bog; however, they appear to show no signs of weathering, and the fourth artefact appears to have been deliberately deposited on its side and then covered with a dense layer of brushwood. Examples of similar objects have been found in bogs elsewhere in Europe (particularly Denmark), and an anthropomorphic figure from a bog at Ralaghan, Co.

It is hoped that further research will help to confirm the function and date of these objects. They have now been removed to a secure facility for further conservation and analysis.
