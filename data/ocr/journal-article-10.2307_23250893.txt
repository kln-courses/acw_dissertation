This article explores memories of a biological control programme in French colonial Madagascar involving introduced cochineal insect predation on equally exotic prickly pear. Drawing on data collected in Malagasy communities over a twenty year period (1981 -2003), it charts the dramatic revisions that local narrative has undergone as the eradication of 'Malagasy Cactus' in the 1920s has become a powerful rhetorical tool in the context of present-day controversy over another, highly invasive, prickly pear. Experience of biological invasion in the present has been reshaping historical memory while reinterpreted narrative of past biological control is informing current debates. The paper relates these narrative shifts to broader political and social developments, highlighting the way encounters with green governmentality and humanitarian assistance are mediating renarrated pasts.

When vazaha [French colonisers] arrived in this land, they could see no people because they were all hiding in the thickets of prickly pear. This intrigued the vazaha. 'What are you doing in the woods?' they asked. 'Oh, we're just in the woods', came the reply. 'Ok', said the vazaha, 'explain properly. How do you survive in the woods? What do you eat?' 'We get by on prickly pear cactus', replied the gay. 'That's our staple food'.1 You see people in those days weren't farmers. They didn't grow crops, didn't wear clothes. All they did was eat prickly pears in the woods. The French were surprised to hear this! It was something they'd never encountered before. Our food, Malagasy Cactus, was a wonderful food for us gasy. It made us podgy, plump. The colonisers killed it because they couldn't find workers. We didn't choose to give up Malagasy Cactus. It was killed by the state because people hid in the thickets. The French at Toliara fetched poizy to kill Malagasy Cactus. So then there was no food. And the French ordered them to stop fighting, to stop the killing. All people did in those days was quarrel and murder one another in amongst the prickly pears. And after Malagasy Cactus died the vazaha said 'Here are hoes, here are axes, grow crops, cultivate fields. Here's money. You'll be gasy no longer. You'll become vazaha.' And they distributed raketambazaha [lit. foreign, coloniser's or white man's cactus]. Raketambazaha was already around. But when Malagasy Cactus died, the French ordered [people] to plant it so 'you can eat the leaves'.2 Interview, Sikina, Befeha, 3/12/2002.

Natural scientists look regularly to the past to provide a broader evidential base for theory about invasive species and their management than can be provided by the standard scientific methodologies.5 Scholars in the humanist disciplines explore the importance of interests, values, needs and aspirations in determining attitudes to exotic species by revisiting contestations in the past.6 By excavating historical narratives about species introductions, they highlight the deeply cultural significances that underpin the very concepts of 'useful plants'and 'weeds'.7 For scholars of all disciplines, however, written documents can be less than satisfactory points of departure. A natural science enquiry into alien species based on the searching of historical records often encounters unreliable species identifications and a paucity of quantitative data that limit the value of the case Richard N.

Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="4">64 KAREN MIDDLETON study in building predictive models,8 while marked asymmetries in the opinions recorded for posterity restrict insights into historical debates. It is generally ac cepted that the cost-benefits of introduced species are seldom distributed evenly among 'stakeholders'. Moreover, many major incidents of species spread and control took place in European colonies. People at the margins of state, the ar gument might go, are usually less well represented in written sources than are elites, governments, and colonial rulers. Thus, the histories of introduced species are likely to be retold more from the perspective of scientists and government officials than of the local communities who actually lived with the plants and were impacted on by their control. The problems of imbalance in written sources can be overstated. Marginal 'voices' are often better represented in written records than is at first apparent and/or can be recovered by reading such records for the 'silences' or 'against the grain'. Even so, it may still be thought useful to supplement search of the written records with the collection of oral evidence from local people, particularly in instances of species spread and eradication that occurred in living memory. The precedents for such an undertaking appear encouraging. An extensive literature in environmental history now claims to draw on local knowledge and social memory to provide alternative insights into past landscapes, often challenging received wisdoms.9 There is, however, hardly a consensus on the place of memory in academic history-writing.10 Many historians value oral testimony, seeing it as a source specific to subordinate and marginalised historical experience and thus a way of producing alternative (and in colonial contexts genuinely non-Western) his tories. Some even question the preference given by 'scientific history' to written 8. Cf. Richard N.

Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="5">RENARRATING A BIOLOGICAL INVASION 65 documentation as historical evidence." But others view popular narratives as a qualitatively different and less reliable resource than written material. Highlight ing a ceaseless dialectic of remembering and forgetting, they point to the role of narrated pasts in identity construction and to the way memory is co-opted by contemporary political projects.12 Some note that 'memory' is often charac terised by epistemologies and mythical temporalities that are at odds with the linear perspectives of time that inform modern history. In its strongest version, this approach reduces memory to a form of cultural production that constantly reconstructs the past in line with present needs. From this perspective, there is no true or false memory. People are in effect 'remembering the present' (to deploy Johannes Fabian's turn of phrase) rather than the past.13 This paper addresses some of these issues by exploring community memories of a biological control programme in French colonial Madagascar involving insect predation on a prickly pear. I shall refer to this prickly pear as 'Malagasy Cactus' in translation of raketa gasy, the name my Malagasy informants gave to the plant.14 A variety of Opuntia (Cactaceae) native to South America, it had been introduced into Madagascar in the late eighteenth century, via Tolanaro (Fort Dauphin) in the southeast. By the late nineteenth century, when France annexed Madagascar as a colony, the plant was found throughout the island but had become especially dominant, some say invasive, in its southernmost parts. Boom subsequently turned to bust in the 1920s when the plant succumbed to an introduced cochineal insect within the space of a few years. In its day the circumstances and consequences of this event caused intense controversy in French colonial circles. While commentators agreed that an ex traordinary landscape transformation had been wrought in southern Madagascar, they agreed on little else. One faction emphasised the socio-economic benefits that Malagasy Cactus had brought to vulnerable people trying to survive in a dryland while the opposing faction saw dense, thorny thickets that grew up to 4-5 metres high and 7-8 metres deep as an obstacle to 'progressive' forms of 11.

There is an emerging consensus that the correct identification for Malagasy Cactus is Opuntia monacantha. However, while I recognise that it would be useful for readers to have the scientific names for prickly pears discussed in this article, I am reluctant to make definitive pronouncements given the inconsistences in a literature too often authored by non-specialists in Opuntia taxonomy.

On the whole, opinion within the colonial administration came to view the intervention as ill-advised. Today, there has been a resurgence of interest in the story, partly in the context of modern environmental concerns.16 Identified early as a 'hotspot' for megabiodiversity, Madagascar has long been the focus for international conservation efforts but it was only in the mid-1990s that greater recognition of biodiversity in the island's 'spiny dry forest' began to focus global attention on the natural history of the Malagasy Deep South.17 Given the enduring impasse over key issues in Malagasy Cactus history, it is tempting to tum to social memory in an attempt to address all kinds of questions on which we seem unable to agree on the basis of available written evidence. Was Malagasy Cactus invasive? How important, economically speaking, was the plant? To what extent were local people dependent on Malagasy Cactus? Did they welcome its spread? Was Malagasy Cactus killed accidentally or intentionally? And, one of the most contested points in colonial literature, did people die in large numbers as a result? At first blush local people would seem ideally placed to settle at least some of these questions. No one, surely, is better able to remember Malagasy Cactus and what happened when it died than those who lived with the plant and who directly experienced its loss? Yet longstanding debates over the significance of memory for historical reconstructions, even of quite recent events, suggest possible difficulties with such an approach. This essay has three objectives. First, by comparing and contrasting two sets of narrative collected in the early 1980s and the early 2000s, it charts the radical 15.

Secondly, it shows how stories told about the eradication of Malagasy Cactus have become a powerful rhetorical tool in the context of a present-day controversy over another prickly pear. Experience of biological invasion in the present has been reshaping historical memory, while reinterpreted narrative of past biological control is informing current debates. Thirdly, it relates these narrative shifts to broader political and social developments in Madagascar, highlighting the influence of new environmental discourse and new forms of vazaha [stranger] experience - in the shape of green governmentality and hu manitarian assistance - in mediating historical narrative. Altogether these data seem to support a view of memory as cultural production of present time and as a less than reliable source for verifying the past. And yet, by exploring the complexity of memory production, including the interplay between personally acquired autobiographical memory and socially transmitted memory, the article also points to the possibility of a more nuanced approach to local knowledge of the past. CONTEXT OF STUDY The interview data reported in this essay were collected in the Karembola region of dryland Madagascar (Tsihombe and Beloha Districts) in 1981-1983 and in 2002-2003. The first data set was collected almost incidentally during extended fieldwork for a doctorate in social anthropology. The second data set - a more diverse set of narratives - was collected twenty years later in the course of environmental history research. From the perspective of studying memory, it is important to register not only the twenty years that had elapsed between the two field studies but also the fact that both sets of interview data relate to an event that took place in the late 1920s - that is, several decades before. Thus, even in the first study in the early 1980s 'eyewitness' informants were already drawing on distant memories of Malagasy Cactus and its eradication while younger informants were 'remembering' events they had not themselves seen.18 Secondly, it should be noted that narrators in the second study (2002-2003) did not have the benefit of written materials and tape-recordings I had made in the early 1980s and so were generally unaware of the ways in which local narra tive, including their own narrative, had changed over the intervening years. In a non-literate society such as rural Karembola, where transmitted memory is oral rather than inscribed, important narrational shifts can occur without the narra tors themselves being necessarily conscious of the fact. Thirdly, it is relevant to note that, in addition to collecting oral histories, as a social anthropologist I have always employed participant-observation techniques aimed at eliciting 18. Unfortunately it is not possible to compare these interview data with earlier memory because local Malagasy opinion was not recorded in any detail at the time. Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="8">68 KAREN MIDDLETON in-depth qualitative understandings of local knowledge and practice and that in both field studies this approach enabled me to go beyond formal interview data to explore the ways in which Malagasy Cactus narration was used in everyday life. Fourthly, it is worth recording that, while I draw occasionally on archival research to comment on interview material in this article, detailed discussion of the written records through confrontation of multiple data sources for the purposes of historical reconstruction is not my objective here. Turning to the broader economic and political contexts of the compara tive study, in some respects rural Karembola changed little between the early 1980s and the early 2000s. In both fieldwork periods almost all villagers were subsistence farmers, cropping manioc, maize, sweet potatoes, millet, pumpkins, melons, squash and various legumes, with restricted market participation. With harvests entirely dependent on hand hoe technology and low, poorly distributed and unreliable rainfall, agricultural productivity was low. Many households also reared zebu cattle and small ruminants that they sold to buy in food when field crops failed. However, wealth in livestock was very unequally distributed and in both periods there were households in all communities with inadequate holdings to meet their economic needs. Some cash was derived from selling extractive plant products (ricin, periwinkle) and lobster via middlemen to global markets or from trading fish and contraband tobacco. But local opportunities for income diversification were limited and in many households cultivated foods were necessarily supplemented in the dry season and extended droughts by trapped and gathered foods. Some Karembola migrated to other regions of Madagascar where they typically found work as agricultural labourers, night watchmen and rickshaw pullers. In the early 1980s, as in the early twenty-first century, prickly pears made a crucial contribution to local food security, enabling farmers to bridge food and fodder shortfalls. The fruits and cladodes (leaf pads) have been harvested for human consumption, the succulent cladodes exploited to feed and water livestock, and the spinier varieties used to make stout hedging for vegetable gardens and cattle pens.19 It might even be the case that prickly pears became more important during the 1990s as the introduction of free market economics and the growing appropriation of land for nature conservation, coupled possibly with environmental change, contributed to the growing pauperisation of many households in this already disadvantaged region. Indeed, while Karembola to date has been less affected by external mining and conservation interventions than districts further east, the experiences of economic liberalisation, green 19.

Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="9">RENARRATING A BIOLOGICAL INVASION 69 governmentality, and humanitarian assistance have all reshaped Malagasy Cactus narrative in significant ways. MALAGASY CACTUS: THE 'NATIONALIST' NARRATIVE In the early 1980s, when I first conducted fieldwork in Karembola, there was a shared narrative about Malagasy Cactus. Briefly, the story went like this: Malagasy Cactus was a plant native to Karembola, a plant the ancestors found growing in profusion when they came into the land. Its fruit and leaf pads became staples for the ancestors and their cattle, bringing them prosperity in an otherwise thirsty land. The French colonial administration, however, hated Malagasy Cactus because people hid among the thickets and survived on the fruit. The plant made it difficult to pacify the region, to recruit labour for public works and settler plantations and to get the taxes in. So the vazaha introduced an insect to kill the plant. The consequences were devastating as people and cattle, suddenly deprived of food and water, either died in vast numbers or fled the region for other parts of the colony, many never to return. 'The time of the ancestors' was over, and 'foreign time' began. Karembola was left a 'broken land' where 'people could only nod their heads in agreement whenever vazaha spoke'.20 For present purposes, I shall dub this the 'nationalist' version of Malagasy Cactus history because it overlaps with narrative that appeared in the Malagasy nationalist press soon after the event. (The most obvious difference between the two versions is that while the nationalist press in the early 1930s offered an essentially secular account of the colonial intervention, my informants embed ded it in a more 'religious' account.) In the early 1980s this narrative was a communal narrative in the sense that it was known and reproduced by all Karembola I met. In fact, the story formed a normative component of our encounter, following shortly on after the greeting 'Hail vazahal What brings you to this thirsty land?'A defining statement of the gasy-vazaha relationship, narrative around 'the moment the cactus died' at this time provided the foundational myth of Karembola society and the cornerstone of Karembola identity. That the demise of Malagasy Cactus had led to such a strong and consistent nationalist narrative can, I think, be taken as indicative of the plant's erstwhile importance to Karembola culture and economy. It would be wrong to suppose, however, that narrators were solely concerned to remember the defining mo ment in Karembola history. Another reason why rural Karembola in the 1980s continued to renarrate the decades-old tragedy was because Malagasy Cactus narrative offered an 20. Cf. Karen Middleton, 'Circumcision, Death, and Strangers', Journal of Religion in Africa, 27 (1997): 341-73. Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="10">70 KAREN MIDDLETON oblique way of commenting on more recent political developments. Such an interpretation may at first seem counter-intuitive in that the narrative of French complicity, which forms the core of the nationalist narrative, seems wholly in keeping with the anti-imperialist rhetoric of the early Ratsiraka state. Coming to power in the wake of the Malagasy Socialist Revolution, this was a state which actively encouraged its citizens to recover memories of colonial suffering as a way of contrasting itself to its immediate predecessor, Tsiranana's so-called 'neo-colonial' regime (1960—1972).21 In fact, by the early 1980s, deteriorating economic conditions and a top-down socialism meant that few Karembola still bought into the idea of a 'second independence'. Rather, they described them selves as living in a land still controlled by vazaha, where Karembola could only nod their heads in agreement to whatever vazaha proposed. In this context, the master narrative of Malagasy Cactus with its reflections on state power and Karembola impotence remained as apposite a commentary on governance and economy under the Second Republic as it had been under colonial rule.22 NEW CENTURY, NEW NARRATIVE I have described the nationalist version of Malagasy Cactus history that was current in early 1980s Karembola. Returning to the subject in the early twenty first century (2002-03), I was genuinely startled to discover that the communal narrative I had internalised twenty years earlier was now attracting lively, often acrimonious, debate. While every Karembola I spoke to still attributed the death of Malagasy Cactus to vazaha intervention, they now disputed almost every other detail of the story: whether Malagasy Cactus had been invasive; whether the French had been right to intervene; whether local people had also desired its eradication; and, perhaps most startling of all, given the evidence, whether any local people had actually died or suffered as a result. While the basic storyline from the 1980s persisted, its meaning, the social and political lessons that indi vidual narrators drew from it, had in many cases been dramatically reworked. In less than a generation, widely shared memory and interpretation had given way to surprisingly diverse narrative about the past. 21. Cf.

Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="11">RENARRATING A BIOLOGICAL INVASION 71 In some quarters local narrative had become sympathetic to the French colo nial administration. While the motives ascribed to the intervention had remained constant, viz., to pacify the region, to secure labour for settlers in more fertile parts of the colony by creating famine and to facilitate tax collection, for many narrators these were now the perfectly justified motives of a 'civilising' state. I first became aware of significant disparity between narrative versions when informants described the method by which Malagasy Cactus was killed. In the 1980s Karembola had been unanimous in stating that 'Malagasy Cactus had been eaten (predated) by insects (biby)\ an opinion that was consistent with the scientific facts.23 By 2002-03 there was widespread disagreement among narrators on whether the French had conducted chemical or biological warfare (or both) against the plant. To be sure, the narrative of biological control still had many adherents, especially among surviving eyewitnesses. In the following, for example, an elderly speaker recalls how The posy that killed it [Malagasy Cactus] was very red, white outside, red when dead [...]. We were afraid of the blood, there was blood. 'What's this bibyV we wondered. We didn't eat it because we thought it might kill [us too].24 But many informants now had in mind some form of chemical warfare, stating explicitly that 'It was the French from Tulear who killed it, with poizy ... the plant was killed by poizy, not insects' (poizy, tsy biby).25 Some elaborated this distinction by comparing the agent deployed against Malagasy Cactus with the chemical products that the government uses to control pests such as locusts, cockroaches and rats.26 The idea of a double killing, a combined package of targeted measures, involving both chemical and insect agents, staggered over an extended period of time to ensure full control of the plant, had also become popular. Most com 23. Almost all published accounts, whatever their other antagonisms, concur that Malagasy Cactus was killed by a cochineal insect or Dactylopius species (see e.g. Henri Perrier de la Bathie, 'Introduction a Tananarive du Coccus cacti ou Cochenille du Figuier d'Inde', Bulletin economique de Madagascar et dependances 21, 3-4 (1924): 222; Petit, 'Introduction a Madagascar': 163; CI.

There is significant semantic instability around key vernacular in these narratives, with some speakers using the terms biby and posy/poizy as synonyms for 'insect' (as for example when a speaker glossed posy as 'biby, living creatures') while others drew a clear distinction between biby meaning 'insect' and posy/poizy meaning 'chemicals' (as when they likened 'thisposy' to 'medicines used against cockroaches' (fanafoly bararaoke)). These open-ended meanings seem to be both related to and productive of the now widespread confusion over the agent of control.

When the French arrived, they couldn't see the population ... So they appliedpoizy, applied a medicine (isiahefanafoly), Mala gasy Cactus died, and everybody left the woods. Then [there was] a creature, a living thing (biby; raha velone) which ate [the plant]. You can still see the insect on surviving stands. But actually I'm not sure who killed it and how because it's only what I've been told. The population went hungry, the cattle too. Everything perished. After which this land became dark.27 Another distinctive feature of early twenty-first century narrative, and one that seems to be directly correlated to the rising conviction about chemical control, was the frequent references to an airborne campaign. Thus, according to the respondent just quoted, 'plane[s] flew past carrying the poizy [chemicals], spraying it, dropping it on the plants, whereupon [Malagasy Cactus] died'.28 In theory, the idea of a two-pronged campaign against Malagasy Cactus could appear plausible. Multiple strategies involving chemical products and various insect species, supplemented in some instances by mechanical measures such as felling, stacking and burning the plants, were deployed in parallel campaigns against Opuntia in South Africa and Australia (though never to my knowledge planes). The aim almost invariably was to improve efficacy when the applica tion of single measures failed to achieve desired levels of control.29 There is no 27. Betaimboroke, 15/12/2003. 28. Betaimboroke, 15/12/2003. 'Memory' of an airborne chemical campaign is not a wholly recent production. Though 1 recorded no such narrative in Karembola in the 1980s, there is newspaper evidence that such stories were already circulating in the 1960s, at least amongst Tandroy emigrees in Anosy (D.R. 'A l'ecoute d'un migrant antandroy', Lumiere 1821, 11/4/1971). More recently, Kaufmann reports a narrative from Androka, Mahafale that has aeroplanes dropping cochineal-infested cladodes, rather than chemical products, on Malagasy Cactus (Jeffrey Kaufmann, 'Cactus Pastoralism on Madagascar', Ph.D dissertation, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2001, p. 205). Given the polysemy and ambiguity of terms such as poizy/posy noted in note 26, it would have been useful to have this testimony as original, unredacted text. In any case, the narrator is a gendarme 'whose homeland was several hundred kilometers north'. It is interesting that the two earliest modernising narratives on record involve narrators who are not only 'outsiders' to local society but also in their different ways 'progressive', civilising agents in the south: the gendarme because he is educated and closely associated with state power; the narrator of the text published by Lumiere because he has left his native Androy to become a rice farmer elsewhere. While external narrative of this kind may have been a source for Karembola retellings, neither the gendarme nor the emigrant, it should be noted, posits the double sequenced hit involving chemicals and insects that characterised many peasant narratives in 2002-2003. 29.

Cochineal predation on this plant was too rapid to require such help. Another, to my mind particularly disconcerting, narrative development was that, by 2002-03, famine denial had become rife. The very core of 1980s narrative had been that the loss of Malagasy Cactus had resulted in a killing famine that decimated the cattle herds, left large numbers of Karembola dead and drove a mass exodus of survivors from the land. This in turn had fractured the social fabric, depriving Karembola of its spiritual and political leadership, leaving only 'children' behind. By 2002-03 famine narrative, while evidently still current, no longermonopo lised the imagination because significant numbers of Karembola now insisted that food had not been a problem when Malagasy Cactus died. Some claimed that the fruit had only ever been a mainstay for vagabonds, slaves and bandits, people living on the margins of Karembola society. The implication was not only that eradication had fairly restricted economic impacts but that indolent, quasi-criminal elements got their just deserts. Others still portrayed Malagasy Cactus as the ancestral tree of providence that 'made all things flourish in this thirsty land', but undermined this received wisdom by claiming either that 'people fell back on wild food (tindroke), they found sonjo, bazaha [other cacti], when Malagasy Cactus died', or that people had made an immediate transition from Malagasy Cactus dependency to agriculture by taking up hoes and cropping the now vacant land. These early twenty-first century renarrations departed dramati cally from popular memory of twenty years earlier but resonated powerfully with narratives produced by colonial protagonists of eradication seventy odd years before. Following a visit to the neighbouring Mahafale region in 1929, for instance, Georges Petit related how he had observed its residents eagerly plant ing manioc and maize in land liberated from prickly pear.30 He and like-minded commentators also insisted that Malagasy Cactus fruit had never been a human staple and that the spineless cactus (raketambazaha) would provide a superior fodder plant.31 Such views would have been heretical in 1980s Karembola. Famine narrative was deeply entrenched. Initially I was inclined to attribute these representational shifts to generation and the passage of time. I reasoned that, in the early 1980s, many Karembola who had witnessed Malagasy Cactus were still alive. They had eaten the fruit, they had lived its landscapes and they had witnessed its death. Perhaps more importantly, at the time of that first fieldwork, Malagasy Cactus survivors mo nopolised leadership positions in Karembola communities. As village elders, J.

In those arguably more deferential days, it was predominantly their discourse that shaped public discourse. By 2002 surviving eyewitnesses were naturally far fewer and most had been little more than young children at the time Malagasy Cactus died. Moreover, given their advanced age, they no longer controlled public memory: effective power had passed to men of middle age. I intuitively supposed that younger generations, who had only heard about Malagasy Cactus third- or fourth-hand, might be more likely to map current perceptions of vazaha practice upon 'memories' of the past. Take, for instance, the confusion over chemical control. Although to my knowledge chemicals have never been deployed against Opuntia in Madagascar, their routine use to control all manner of other pests and disease in the island, including, most notably, the widespread application of DDT in the 1950s, had made chemical control more familiar to most Karembola by the late twentieth century than biological control.32 As for revisionist narrative of an airborne attack on Malagasy Cactus, its most likely inspiration was the Locust Control Service, which for decades has conducted flights in the Malagasy Deep South.33 Other possible sources for misremembered history, which may have been compounded to make aerial bombardment a symbol of vazaha power, include wartime bombing by British planes during the campaign to take Madagascar from Vichy France; flights in the 1950s aimed at seeding artificial rain; and, further afield, aerial bombard ment of East Coast Madagascar during the repression of the 1947-1948 anti colonial rebellion. On closer inspection, age-related explanation proved too simple, in that the production of anachronistic narrative was by no means confined to younger generations. In some instances even those who had witnessed the original event had changed their story, become less certain of the details, over twenty years past. One elderly woman whom I shall name Nirisoa narrated how the French had brought chemical-spraying planes from Tulear, but readily admit ted when questioned that she 'didn't actually see the planefs] [but] only saw Malagasy Cactus die'. She went on to describe a 'biby [that] was white, white but red inside when cut. The red got on your clothes', unmistakable eyewitness 32. Although a Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology was created in 1931, chemical interventions remained the preferred government option in Madagascar until at least the 1970s. Cf. J. Appert, M.

Although this service was created in 1928, its deployment of planes in the Malagasy Deep South began much later. Indeed, the first aircraft of any kind to fly over the region are said to date to 1931 (Decary, L 'Androy, p. 246). For the record, the cochineal had reached Karembolaby 1928.

This is by no means unusual. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that so-called 'eye witness' testimony is often composed of ocular evidence combined with, and reinterpreted in the light of, narrative heard from others, at the time or subsequently.35 It might be useful in this instance to adopt an intersubjective approach to memory (narrative) production. Lambek and Antze, for example, propose to distinguish among author, narrator, character, reader, elicitor and censor when analysing narrative change.36 While there is not the scope to pursue such a fine grained approach in this article, it is tempting to speculate that Nirisoa's narrative represents an attempt to combine her personal experience of insects that stained one's clothing red (what we might term local knowledge grounded in empirical observation) with other narrative versions of the same history she had heard. It may even be that 'memory' of a two-pronged attack on Malagasy Cactus has become popular in Karembola partly as an way of reconciling competing ver sions authored by persons with competency and authority in different domains. Many elderly narrators appeared to lack the confidence to assert the veracity of their childhood memory. Although they could have documented their narrative of biological control by visual inspection of surviving stands of Malagasy Cactus, they seemed vulnerable to suggestion, if not outright censorship, by younger audiences more familiar with vazaha technology and to whom a modernising, albeit secondhand, narrative perhaps originating beyond Karembola offered a seemingly more credible explanation of the event. By combining both narratives 34. Nirisoa, Befeha, 3/12/2002.

RAKETAMENA AS CONTEXT OF RENARRATION I have made some preliminary suggestions for analysing certain imaginative retellings of Malagasy Cactus narrative using an intersubjective model that pays attention to the way memory is informed by interactions between various actors accessing both external and local knowledge, including the ideas Karembola themselves hold about generation and authority. A more immediate context for Malagasy Cactus renarration in the early 2000s, however, was the controversy that had erupted over a contemporary prickly pear. Raketamena or 'red prickly pear' (so-named on account of the colour of its fruit) is a fairly recent arrival in Karembola that has been spreading aggressively since (at least) the 1970s and has now claimed vast tracts of land. Some reports describe it as Opuntiastricta or Opuntiastriata (Haw.),37 a species ranked among 'One Hundred of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species'.38 Despite the growing ascendancy of biodiversity discourse during the latter years of Ratsiraka's Second Republic, environmental reviews published in the 1980s had tended to gloss over the issues raised by naturalised Opuntia in the Malagasy Deep South.39 Informally, I was told that conservationists were very much against the introductions but were keeping quiet because they knew that local peoples relied upon the plants. However, the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the subsequent Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to which Madagascar became a signatory, had changed public discourse by defining invasion by alien species as the most serious threat to global indigenous biodiversity after habitat destruction. Directing signatories to take practical action to 'prevent the intro duction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, 37. ANGAP-FOFIFA-WWF (n.d.)

However, rather than publish indiscriminate critiques of all Opuntia introductions, WWF was targeting ra ketamena - a focus which benefited from some local community support. Two WWF-commissioned reports had described the negative impacts of raketamena infestations on biodiversity and subsistence farming in Marovato and Tranovaho Communes (Tsihombe and Beloha Sub-Prefectures) and claimed that there was a consensus within local communities on the need for eradication.41 Following extended criticism of an approach that was overly focused on the conservation of plants and animals to the detriment of local people's needs, WWF, like other key stakeholders in Madagascar, had reformulated its policy in the late 1980s to embrace a rhetoric that stressed the need to integrate develop ment and environmental concerns. In so far as there was, or at least appeared to be, a coincidence between its biodiversity objectives and local socio-economic interests, a campaign against raketamena appeared to promise WWF a pro ject that would deliver on this rhetoric. Identifying such projects had become pressing following the 2002 elections. Pro-capitalist Marc Ravalomanana, the newly elected President of Madagascar, was underscoring his expectation that environmental organisations would make an important contribution, alongside foreign investment and the private sector, to achieving millennium goals of poverty eradication and economic growth. The WWF-sponsored reports had overstated the matter, however, in claiming that an initiative against raketamena had unanimous local support. Certainly all the Karembola I interviewed in Marovato and Tranovaho Communes in 2002-03 viewed raketamena as a prolific spreader that was infesting fields and grazing lands. However, local opinion was deeply divided over what should happen to the plant. Many villagers did call for its swift and total eradication. But others protested vehemently that the fruit was keeping them alive and that without raketamena they and their families would die. In effect, raketamena had differential cost-benefits for individual households according to their resource endowments. No one suggested that raketamena was an ideal food or made light of its impacts on agro-pastoral productivity; but for poorer community members, 40.

By contrast, wealthier families (in 2002-03) not only had little need for raketamena - those short of food were raising cash by selling cows and goats at market - but many blamed staggering livestock losses on the plant.42 Critically, raketamena spread was viewed as undermining elite power, which depends on producing food and livestock surpluses for use in patronage and exchange networks. These different valuations of raketamena would probably have remained a source of grievance within local communities had external agencies not become involved. A meeting during which 'community leaders' had discussed raketa mena with vazaha (the term vazaha here designates a mixture of expatriates and Malagasy nationals, notably government agronomists and WWF person nel) had greatly inflamed the issue when, or so it was widely reported, these vazaha had promised to introduce insects to eradicate the plant. By November 2002, when I arrived in the field, popular belief in the imminent prospect of eradication had ratcheted up emotions and focused everybody's attention on the raketamena debate. This controversy over raketamena had had discernable impacts on Mala gasy Cactus narrative. First and most obviously, by 2002-03 it had become almost impossible for Karembola to narrate the story of Malagasy Cactus without working in an extended metacommentary on raketamena. This involved comparing or contrasting the two species on a host of characteristics from the botanical (spininess, modes of reproduction and propensity to invasiveness) to the utilitarian (comparative cost-benefits as hedging, fodder and human food). Comparative exercises extended to what might be predicted about the consequences of raketamena eradication for livelihoods and food security on the basis of what happened when Malagasy Cactus died. Even the very elderly who had experienced Malagasy Cactus in person had revised their narration in the light of contemporary debates. Recent experience of raketamena was reshaping 'memories' of Malagasy Cactus for all informants regardless of age. Consider, for instance, Zomana, a sprightly septuagenarian who had eaten Malagasy Cactus as a small boy. In 1981, when I first made his acquaintance, he had subscribed apparently without reservation to the nationalist narrative of the death of Malagasy Cactus as the event that put an end to gasy times. Twenty years later, he had reoriented his narration to address the issue of raketamena, a plant that was visibly encroaching on land all about his house. According to Zomana now, Malagasy Cactus had spread exactly like raketamena. If its fruits dropped, they all rooted too. [Malagasy Cactus] just grew without being planted. Nowadays [people] are enlightened, 42. Further detail on stakeholder perceptions and livelihood strategies is given in Middleton, 'Red Prickly Pear'. Because the raketamena issue was so controversial in Karembola villages, the names of informants mentioned in this article have been changed.

Raketamena is giving us a hard time, it's changing the land.43 Reflecting on raketamena in the present, Zomana here recovers a 'memory' of Malagasy Cactus invasiveness he had never articulated in my presence before. We know that landscape often presents deeply evocative cues for remembrance.44 Yet the central event in Karembola history - the landscape transformation of the 1920s - had always been invisible precisely because Malagasy Cactus had disappeared. Indeed, the endless retellings of the story in the early 1980s were driven partly by the desire to reveal Malagasy Cactus as a latent presence in the contemporary landscape, to make explicit a concealed history. Now in the early twenty-first century, seventy odd years after the event, the sight of the raketamena infestations seemed to be awakening dormant memories, acting as a prompt to surviving eyewitnesses to look beyond communal narrative and remember how things really were. Zomana here not only articulates memories of plant invasiveness he had not mentioned in the 1980s. He also pushes the analogy between Malagasy Cactus and raketamena to the point of appearing to question the wisdom of the ancestors. 'Nowadays [people] are enlightened', he says; 'Were people back then wise?' Zomana's temporal scales have also shifted: it is the incursion of raketamena and the suffering it is causing, rather than the death of Malagasy Cactus, that he now highlights as the sign of altered, more difficult times. At the very least, experience of raketamena in the present has prompted Zomana to produce historical narrative of greater ambiguity than before. Nonetheless, unlike many younger, non-eyewitness narrators, Zomana holds back from portraying the eradication of Malagasy Cactus as progress. Despite its putative invasive ness, he still insists, as in the 1980s, on the excellence of Malagasy Cactus as a food. 'It was one of the Opuntia that truly nourish', he says, 'a proper meal, people's true food'45 It is clear that, with the WWF seeking to push forward a programme of raket amena eradication or control, the Malagasy Cactus story had acquired critical meaning in the context of contemporary debates. Raketamena was presenting serious existential choices for rural Karembola and renarrated Malagasy Cactus history offered villagers on all sides of the debate an opportunity to voice situ ated commentaries on the benefits and the risks. 43.

They found deep parallels between their own dependency on raketamena at times of hardship and the erstwhile importance of Malagasy Cactus as a food. By emphasising how intensely the ancestors had suffered when their staple was taken from them, they hoped to underscore the food security risks that raketamena eradication would pose. Listen, for instance, to Celestine, one of raketamena's most impassioned defenders. She had heard, she told me, that vazaha were planning to kill raketamena and wanted to 'notify' them that We, the poor [ondate tsy manan-draha, lit. 'people who have nothing'], we don't want raketamena killed. We don't have cattle, goats, sheep to sell to buy food. ... We don't have poultry ... [Raketamena] is our food from dawn to dusk . ...We couldn't manage to hoe [our fields] if we didn't have raketamena to eat. Without prompting, Celestine proceeded to draw analogies between the fate that awaited her family and other needy households were raketamena to be eradicated and what happened when Malagasy Cactus died: They went hungry. It was their only food. So when the vazaha killed it, everybody fled, died on the way. That's how the many came to go north ... If you killed raketamena, we couldn't even go north; we don't have the fare. We'd just die on the way. When raketamena dies, we die [too]. Only those with money made it [when Malagasy Cactus died].46 From this, one might suppose that it was generally more affluent Karembola who were producing and promoting new, historically problematic, readings of the story (notably, famine denial) in support of a pro-eradication stance. Cer tainly, many supporters of raketamena eradication did make light of the pos sible consequences by denying that anyone had gone hungry when Malagasy Cactus died. Just as gasy in the 1930s had turned to other wild foods or set to work with hoes, so, they argued, people would do the same if raketamena were killed. Similarly, those who transposed the memory of recent food relief back onto Malagasy Cactus history now projected this memory forward onto raketamena eradication, insisting that Of course hunger is to be feared [if raketamena were to die] but you vazaha have always taken care of us when we've been hungry since ancestral times ... For two years [1992-3] we received rations (hanem-bode, lit. 'orphan's food') 46. Celestine, Befeha, 12/12/2002. In fact, some were transported by labour recruiters while many more walked a thousand kilometres and more to find work. Poor people such as Celestine did not necessarily reproduce the nationalist storyline unadulterated. It was quite possible for them to introduce anachronistic narrative (airborne chemical campaigns) and even new views of vazaha power (see below) while retaining the core element of the great famine that rang so true with their own experience and fears. Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="21">RENARJRATING A BIOLOGICAL INVASION 81 because we couldn't plant crops. Butter-beans, maize, you gave food. If vazaha do kill raketamena, we shan't go without.47 Others, taking a more robust line, argued that, just as only good-for-nothings had relied on Malagasy Cactus, so too only the feckless relied on raketamena today. And, since these raketamena eaters elected not to work, unlike 'worthy' villagers, it would be entirely 'their own fault if they suffered, starved when raketamena dies'.48 Generally, however, the use of Malagasy Cactus narrative was less homo geneous on the pro-eradication side. Not everyone who wanted action to rid 'Madagasikara' of raketamena automatically engaged in famine denial, cited Malagasy Cactus as a precedent, portrayed it as invasive or thought its eradica tion had been good. Many informants, especially but not exclusively the elderly, argued the case against raketamena by highlighting all the ways in which modern pest differed from ancestral plant. Thus, Vontana, an elderly man who had known the pre-cochineal landscapes around Tranovaho and hated raketamena with a vengeance, noted that Malagasy Cactus and raketamena were rather similar in that neither plant 'stops fruiting all year round' (in contrast to the shorter seasons of other locally present Opuntia varieties) but that otherwise their fruit bore no comparison as a food. He remembered Malagasy Cactus as A splendid food, rather tart but it fattened you up, a superb food, nourished people, cattle, goats. ... whereas raketamena is a bad food, nothing but bones and skin. It's killing people, livestock, killing the land.49 This style of argument was particularly common among the powerful and the wealthy. These men and their wives had both the most at risk from raketa mena invasion and the most invested in tradition. They owed their power and authority partly to their ability to deliver above-average levels of agro-pastoral productivity and partly to their manipulation of ancestor-focused rhetoric, of which conventional Malagasy Cactus history constituted a key component. Such people generally condemned raketamena and upheld traditional Malagasy Cactus narrative by enumerating a series of botanical and economic contrasts between the two plants: Malagasy Cactus was awaiting the arrival of people.

Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="22">82 KAREN MIDDLETON Community leaders were generally reluctant to deny the great famine because it meant contradicting the core assumption of the nationalist story, namely, that Malagasy Cactus had been the ancestors' food. They preferred to deny the relevance of history to current policy decisions by invoking critical contrasts between then and now. Thus, they generally argued that raketamena eradication would not have the same terrible consequences for Karembola so ciety because 'in those days there were no markets whereas nowadays markets at Soamanitse and Marovato mean you can buy food, there's money, and oxen carts to bring in food'. In short, it was not possible to generalise about uses of Malagasy Cactus narrative in the context of contemporary struggles over raketamena. While many Karembola did make use of a re-narrated memory of Malagasy Cactus to argue the case for raketamena eradication, there was no necessary correlation between the position an individual took on raketamena and the type of Malagasy Cactus narrative he or she produced. Only in the broadest sense could one say that the Malagasy Cactus story had been appropriated and re-narrated to serve the conflicting interests of rich and poor. STORYTELLING IN A 'GOVERNANCE STATE' To analyse Malagasy Cactus narrative as argument embedded in present-day conflict over raketamena implies a certain instrumentality to the storytelling. It suggests that people were tailoring the story they told about the past in order to defend their interests in the present. Or as one theorist of memory puts it, 'people turn to the past to find what they need to support present interests; they find the past they want'. Instrumentality was certainly an important aspect of the 2002-03 renarrations. One reason why recollections of Malagasy Cactus came spilling unprompted into everyday conversation was because as a vazaha I was perceived by many Karembola as someone who might carry influence with the authorities if I could be persuaded to put their side in the raketamena debate. But renarration was also more complex.51 While the raketamena controversy had undoubtedly stimulated interest in and appropriation of Malagasy Cactus narrative, not all the narrative shifts reported in this paper can be explained in such terms. Rhetorical uses of the past were also informed by broader cultural and intellectual developments in Madagascar. These included the influence of new environmental knowledge seeping into rural communities (and memory created through this). Take, for instance, discourse on prickly pear invasiveness, an issue that was conspicuously absent from 1980s commentary but had become pivotal to twenty 51.

All Karembola interviewed in 2002-03, whether they were for or against its eradication, described raketamena as invasive.52 But while all villagers (regardless of eyewitness status) conjured up imagery of an ancestral landscape populated by Malagasy Cactus thickets, only some believed that it had been invasive too. For many informants the very idea of a Malagasy Cactus infestation was a symbolic contradiction because it implied disorder in the ancestral landscape, and the basic tenet of conventional local history was that Malagasy Cactus had been a 'good', 'ancestral' thing. Viewed as a native plant, its remembered profligacy was more often attributed by such informants to natural distribution. It was an aspect of the bounty the ancestors enjoyed. Divine Providence had created Karembola as a dryland but had endowed it with plenty of cactus to ensure that everything thrived. Consequently, where conservationists might be inclined to draw analogies between two weed species, many Karembola insisted on profoundly different interpretations of Malagasy Cactus proliferation and raketamena spread: Malagasy Cactus was awaiting the arrival of people. People found Malagasy Cactus when they came into the land.... This newcomer is different. Malagasy Cactus was there from the beginning, growing. It wasn't invasive; it was some thing good, there from the start. There's land where it grows, land it liked, unlike raketamena which spreads..." It should be noted that when informants said that Malagasy Cactus 'wasn't planted but simply grew' (tsy amboleane fa nitiry avao), they were not neces sarily vocalising the idea that Malagasy Cactus had been a weed. In so far as informants saw Malagasy Cactus as a native species, they could hold the idea of a luxuriant monospecies raketa forest growing spontaneously in favoured habitats, much as a British naturalist might extoll the beech woods of the Chilterns.54 But it was equally clear that other Karembola now 'remembered' Malagasy Cactus as an indigenous weed, a plant that spread without human assistance, a plant that in its day had been as troublesome as raketamena now was 52. The Karembola verb I translate as 'to be invasive' is mandakake. It means 'to spread', 'to cover ground' and in some contexts the English gloss 'invasive' might be overstated. But such a gloss is fully justified when, as with respect to raketamena, informants deploy the verb coupled with other descriptive terms that convey the idea of a plant with 'bad habits' (fomba raty), 'a pest' (biby manahirane) they 'can't remove' (tsy afake). I have no record of any instance from the 1980s in which such vocabulary was applied to Malagasy Cactus. 53. President, Soamanitse, interviewed Barabay, 23/1/2003. 54. Published interpretations of Malagasy Cactus spread range from broadly biological models that see the plant as an aggressive invader (Perrier de la Bathie, 'Introduction a Tananarive') to a 'social planting' thesis at the other extreme (Kaufmann, 'Cactus Pastoralism'), with certain authors arguing for a more complex model that recognises the interplay of natural and social factors in plant spread. Karembola narrative offers a third interpretation: Malagasy Cactus was neither spread by people nor self-propagating alien but a divinely appointed cornucopia in an otherwise thirsty land. Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="24">84 KAREN MIDDLETON I don't know where Malagasy Cactus originated. It was something the ancestors found here. It killed the land just like raketamena. There's none today; it's all gone. If it [starts to] grow, it soon dies. But in the old days it was invasive, a disaster, without parallel.55 Again, there was no necessary correlation between the position an individual took on raketamena and the type of Malagasy Cactus narrative he or she produced. While some informants made use of a re-narrated memory of Malagasy Cactus invasiveness to bolster arguments against raketamena, advocates of raketamena eradication could equally well contrast their patterns of spread. Whatever the narrator's position, Malagasy Cactus retellings had been impacted by exposure to conservationist discourse. For instance, where inform ants in the early 1980s would have simply asserted that Malagasy Cactus had 'accompanied the ancestors from time immemorial', many now volunteered to detail the natural econiches (toerana) they imagined it had once preferred, much as they described typical econiches for other (truly) indigenous species of the southern bush such as fantiolotse (Alluaudiaprocera) or the various Euphorbia (such as famata and ametse). Constantly pressed by western or western-trained botanists for this kind of local knowledge regarding key 'hotspot' native plants, Karembola appear to have responded by incorporating the language into a tra ditional belief system that remembers Malagasy Cactus as a dominant member of an ur-form botanical Karembola. In substituting a nominally more' scientific' discourse for the mythic language that inflected previous renarrations, some informants portrayed Malagasy Cactus as what in equilibrium biology would be termed an old-fashioned 'climax veg etation' - that is, a vegetation that has evolved naturally for certain Karembola habitats. Listen again to Vontana: Malagasy Cactus was only plentiful in the places where it grew. It just grew; it wasn't planted. There was lots of it, but it didn't spread. It was only found where it was found. It wasn't invasive, though there was certain terrain where it abounded, particular spots where it was plentiful.56 There was something double-edged about these seeming borrowings from equilibrium biology. Hybridised modes of discourse could be both simultaneously supportive and subversive of conservationist positions. While renarrated memory of Malagasy Cactus as a raketamena-like invader endorsed conservationist discourse on the dangers of alien species (in effect conceding two instances of dramatic invasion of Karembola by prickly pears), the misappropriation of other typically conservationist idioms of econiches and balance-of-nature paradigms to sustain memory of Malagasy Cactus indigeneity was more subversive in that it placed a globally ubiquitous exotic on a par with rare, highly valued endemic 55.

One might almost suspect such informants of parodying the biological nativism still favoured by conservationists in Madagascar from a non-equilibrial or 'New Ecology' perspective, were they not so obviously convinced that Mala gasy Cactus had been an ancient native plant. While WWF had found local allies over its plans for raketamena eradication, those allies did not always deploy the potential of Malagasy Cactus history as it would.57 It will be apparent that a social history of Malagasy Cactus remembering in Karembola between the early 1980s and the early 2000s cannot be under taken without reference to the growing interactions that took place between local people and conservationists over these years. Karembola were not only producing diverse renarrated pasts partly in response to rumours of a pending vazaha intervention against raketamena-, environmental discourse was also hy bridising with local knowledge more generally to produce new language about the natural world. In this respect, the approach to knowledge advanced in this article departs fundamentally from the stark dichotomisations that currently predominate in studies of interactions between conservationists and local peoples in Madagascar. Existing approaches emphasise conflict and opposition, whereas in the case I am describing local people have also been adopting, adapting and subverting transnational environmental rhetoric, thereby lending new cadences to remembrance of Malagasy Cactus and to commentary on raketamena. This 'rhetorical traffic' was particularly marked in villages located on the periphery of Cap Sainte Marie Special Reserve but was evident throughout Karembola, where conservationist discourse had been disseminated into the remotest vil lage by radio, government directives and, to a lesser extent, primary schools.58 Nor was this a one-way process. There is evidence that WWF in 2002 was partly inhibited in its discourse on raketamena (at least in local contexts) by the continuing authority of traditional Malagasy Cactus narrative (see below).59 57.

Although in recent decades conservation of Madagascar's unique biodiversity had figured prominently in state education, exposing younger Karembola to new ideas, school attendance and adult literacy in Karembola remained low. Wealthier rural Karembola were not necessarily more educated or better travelled: they were more likely to have appropriated conservationist discourse through the radio and their dealings with government and agency personnel than through formal schooling. The term 'elite' is probably a misnomer in the Karembola context if it leads reader to think of an educated, transnational elite such as is found in other parts of Madagascar. 59.

Madagascar's transition from state socialism to neo-liberalism from the mid-1980s through the 1990s had seen the island become increasingly subject to governance by external actors (for example, World Bank and IMF), while a grave famine in 1991-92 brought international humanitarian assistance to the Malagasy Deep South on an unprec edented scale. As a result, WWF's 'Spiny Forest Androy Sub-Region' overlapped with a 'Zone of Food Insecurity' claimed by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Despite a shared rhetoric on needing to integrate environ ment and development, these two agencies conceptualised the region and its problems in very different ways. In 2002-03 such differences spilled over into attitudes to prickly pears.60 In contrast to WWF personnel, personnel of agencies broadly concerned with humanitarian assistance were opposed to raketamena eradication on ac count of the plant's importance in local livelihoods as an emergency resource.61 This was unsurprising since prickly pear consumption was among the multiple indicators of food security that Projet SAP reporters (Systeme Alerte Precocel Early Warning System) were expected to monitor on the ground. Secondly, and less predictably, such personnel were also committed to the nationalist narrative about the past.

They [WWF] approached us, not officially but informally, they approached WFP informally, as lead donor, about the possibility of a project for the management of raketamena in the context of our 'Food-for-Work' schemes. ... But WFP doesn't want to get involved in raketa eradication because people eat raketa. Raketa are beneficial. We knew the history of the cochineal, how people didn't want to work in plantations, how the French introduced the cochineal to destroy and kill the plant.... how it ended in famine.62 There was a marked asymmetry in the use agency personnel made of his tory. In their conversations about raketamena, staff of agencies concerned with humanitarian assistance made explicit and unprompted reference to the great famine that followed the eradication of Malagasy Cactus. Personnel of conservationist agencies, by contrast, seldom mentioned the event. It was not (as far as I could judge from my interactions with them) that the latter actively disavowed public memory of the great famine. It was rather that their narrations focused on raketamena in the present and made limited use of narrative around Malagasy Cactus as a context for or evidence in the raketamena debate. It may be that they felt unable to develop a historiography powerful enough to challenge narrative of the killing famine, a narrative to which so many local gatekeepers still subscribed. Similarly, they may have ventured to deploy renarrated memory of Malagasy Cactus invasiveness to comment on raketamena only to encounter the same fierce rebuttals as I faced whenever I questioned memorialisation of Malagasy Cactus as a native plant. In such circumstances, conservationists may have decided that their case against raketamena was better served (at least when engaging with Karembola villagers) by avoiding historical analogies altogether rather than risking alienating key local allies. To this extent, local memory of Malagasy Cactus had shaped WWF discourse on invasive species just as con servationist discourse had shaped local discourse. WWF had, however, underestimated both the extent to which the national ist narrative of Malagasy Cactus also existed as public memory within parallel institutions (governmental and non-governmental) where it appears to circulate largely without texts, and the degree to which these parallel bodies would use story-telling around Malagasy Cactus as a rhetorical tool in policy debates. Thus, at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) offices in Antananarivo (the capital of Madagascar), I was given to understand that the deeply entrenched association between raketa eradication and famine (which 62. Randranjafizanaka Achilson, Assistant de Programme PAM [WFP], interviewed at WFP regional office Fort Dauphin, 29/11/2002. Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="28">88 KAREN MIDDLETON retellings of the nationalist story reproduce again and again) would probably act as a brake on its approving a funding application for action against raketamena that WWF had recently submitted to FAO.63 'We know that people eat cactus at F ort Dauphin', one Malagasy staff member commented,' Yes we know, we know all about Malagasy Cactus ,..'64 She cited the WWF submission on raketamena as an example of how 'researchers from outside Madagascar submit proposals and make arguments that we Malagasy just know are erroneous without need ing to do any research'.65 It would be mistaken to suppose from this asymmetry in storytelling that an alliance between WWF and rural elites was balanced by an alliance between WFP and the rural poor. Certainly, in terms of formal procedures, WFP was more sensitive to the need to consult all sections of local communities than were conservationist agencies at this time. But in practice the delivery of food aid to Karembola villages in 2002-03 was deeply embedded in local power structures. Not only did many Projet SAP reporters charged with collecting primary socio economic data find it quicker and easier to consult community leaders than to conduct house-to-house enquiries, but community leaders subsequently controlled local participation in (and benefit from) Food-for-Work programmes. In a region where state infrastructure has declined sharply and private enterprise has not filled the gap, WWF and WFP and their respective satellite agencies offered valuable resources to community leaders, a means of building followers and of advancing their own political and economic interests over those of the poor. One outcome of the different positions WFP and WWF personnel took on raketamena and their failure to agree a version of the past was that local elites were left relative autonomy in the history they produced. Production of evolutionary narrative I have suggested that by 2002-03 commentary on the present as well as memory of the past had become imbricated in encounters between local communities and new external agents of change. Just as local discourse on Malagasy Cactus had incorporated idioms from green governmentality, so too it had drawn on experience of food aid. Traditional Malagasy Cactus narrative had bled into WFP policy on raketamena while the experience of humanitarian assistance had led some Karembola to revise their Malagasy Cactus history.66 63.

Dorothee Klaus, Director UNICEF-Madagascar Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="29">89 RENARRATING A BIOLOGICAL INVASION One of the most striking developments was the greater number of Karembola who produced evolutionary narrative that represented the eradication of Malagasy Cactus as a civilising event that transformed primitive, anarchic forest-dwellers, ignorant of money and agriculture, into clean, industrious farmers settled in an open, domesticated landscape. Incorporating basic colonial tropes and metaphors about the perfectibility of Malagasy people and the improvement of Malagasy landscapes, these linear narratives, with their implicit acceptance of the 'civilis ing' mission of French colonialism, were deeply reminiscent of the modernis ing discourse that had inspired the original 1920s campaign against Malagasy Cactus. Not that I should like to draw an over-neat dichotomy between 1980s and early twenty-first century narrative. Even in the 1980s Malagasy Cactus had been embedded in a transformative discourse on the ancestors.67 But no one in that first study had ventured the opinion that its eradication had been a wholly positive event. Important political and economic changes in the intervening years had trans formed Karembola discourse on economy and personhood. I was particularly struck by the way conflicting Malagasy Cactus renarrations resonated with the kind of debates over state socialism and free market solutions that figured in the elections that had brought Ravalomanana to power earlier in the year.68 A continuing electoral process kept such debates topical during fieldwork. That narrative around Malagasy Cactus should be a popular idiom for such reflections in Karembola is perhaps hardly surprising, given the way alternative visions of economy and development - progressive and traditional - had fired 1920s colonial debates.69 From this perspective it is interesting to compare narrational positions on vazaha over time. I indicated that the way vazaha figured in early 1980s narrative was quite complex. A story, which appeared to chime with the isolationism of the socialist era, had been an oblique way of critiquing the Antananarivo-based Marxist regime. By contrast, early twenty-first century rhetoric seemed to be more about co-opting vazaha than expelling, hating or blaming them, the term vazaha here designating the myriad international para-statal bodies that had descended on the Malagasy Deep South. New, generally more positive, attitudes to foreigners and to foreign interventions were another factor that had made the nationalist narrative of Malagasy Cactus less appealing to many Karembola than before. Yet informants were by no means agreed on what greater vazaha involvement meant. Some affirmed their faith in the power of a market economy and foreign investment coupled with a (largely imagined) indigenous Karembola 25/11/2010). It is indicative of WFP sensitivity about these projects that repeated requests for further information have met with no response. 67.

Reinterpreted Malagasy Cactus narrative could be made to resonate with either position, if ambivalently. All these elements of Malagasy Cactus renarration interacted with commen tary on raketamena but were by no means reducible to it. Or, to put it another way, the raketamena question, as a particular dilemma requiring choices to be made, often tapped into other great issues of the day but did not explain these broader existential concerns. CONCLUSION I began this paper by noting sharply contrasting opinions within the academic community on the value of oral memory as a historical resource. With respect to Malagasy Cactus, I have shown how, in contrast to the homogenous, totalising narrative I collected in the 1980s, Karembola in the early 2000s were produc ing a range of diverse texts. I have attributed these developments to changing political contexts, to a new invasive prickly pear, to internal social differentia tion, to the spread of external agencies and conservationist discourses and to reconceptualisations of vazaha and the past. I have suggested that Malagasy Cactus renarrations are to be understood in terms of complex influences, working to different time scales, deploying varying narrative styles. In particular, while contemporary interest led people to remember differently, narrative was far from tailored neatly to suit present needs and certain renarrations were problematic for conservationists seeking local support. One question might be whether differing research interests and styles of fieldwork between the early 1980s and the early 2000s affected these findings. In the first study, I relied on participant-observation to research Karembola kinship and ritual. Malagasy Cactus history was not something I actively elicited; it was narrative that everybody produced. At the time I did not probe this narrative, partly because I met no dissenters, partly because many of those recounting the story had witnessed the events it purported to describe and partly because their version was consistent with ethnography I had read before coming to the field. Moreover, the story seemed persuasive. After all Karembola is a dryland and we were eating lots of prickly pear. In 2002-03, a shorter time in the field and a more narrowly focused research topic necessarily brought greater reliance on semi-structured interviews. More pertinently, as my research interests shifted to environmental issues and my knowledge of invasive species expanded, I asked questions that would not have occurred to me before. It is therefore very possible that my questioning may have contributed to subjects remembering differently. On the other hand, many of the renarrations cited in this article were voiced spontaneously by villagers and can be seen as expressing their own agenda and concerns. My own sense is that, while interactivity is a fundamental and Environment and History 18.1</page><page sequence="31">RENARRATING A BIOLOGICAL INVASION 91 intractable dimension of fieldwork, the key point is that, owing to the temporal coincidence between the spread of raketamena in Karembola and the highlight ing of invasive species in global discourse, both I and my informants had new ideas and experiences to work with. Here precisely the data point to an interesting question. Does the adoption of new knowledge, or new ways of framing old knowledge to address new in terests, make memory less reliable (because the past is renarrated or 'distorted' in the light of current concerns) or more reliable (because serious contemporary challenges stimulate narrators to look more critically at 'official' narrative they have inherited from the past)? The temptation when faced with patently ongoing revisions of popular nar rative of the kind documented in this article is to fall back on well-worn cliches about remembering and forgetting being 'thus locked together in a complicated web' as one version of the past competes with another70, or about memory tell ing us more about people's values and objectives in the present than anything useful about the past. I would take a different position. I agree that variable and discordant stories of Malagasy Cactus need to be located within social histories of remembering. Indeed, I hope I have shown how memories of Malagasy Cactus have been (partly) shaped by politico-economic interests in the present and why it is important to ask how people use particular views of the past in interactions today. But it also seems to me possible to recognise the reconstructive nature of memory without either reducing memory to current use or accepting the modern dictum that all versions of the past are or should be seen as equally valid retellings of a complex event. 'Truth' is of course a difficult word that carries highly moral connotations. Something may be 'true' in many senses, even if the details reported do not correspond exactly with all of the facts. There is much to be gained by following the approach adopted, for instance, by Luise White who, in her book Speaking with Vampires, argues that seemingly fanciful memories about vampires can in fact be more truthful than academic histories because they tell us about how Africans themselves perceived colonialism. She suggests further that such beliefs became factually critical in that they impacted materially on coloni alism.71 Proceeding along similar lines, I suggested that anachronistic stories about chemical-spraying planes express truths about Karembola perceptions of vazaha. (In a region where a ploughed field is still a rare sight and where many households rely for at least part of the year on small cavities in the limestone rock for their water supply, planes remain even now iconic of vazaha modernity, a subject of endless speculation in the field.) We can also see these imaginative retellings as capturing something of the scale of devastation, the extraordinary 70. Rubie S. Watson, 'Introduction', Memory, History and Opposition, p. 18. 71.

Better understandings of past subjectivities can in turn inform current debates on invasive species by giving some sense of what it feels to be an ordinary person whose familiar landscape is transformed by chemical or biological control. But the fact remains that, as a report of the method deployed to eradicate Malagasy Cactus, this narrative element is factually incorrect. What is clear is that one cannot say that overall that one or other version bears a closer relation to what, after Janice Haaken, we might term 'the concrete facticity of events'.72 On some points the earlier 1980s narrative is more reliable. Malagasy Cactus was predated by an insect. Chemicals and planes were not involved. A serious famine in Karembola did follow shortly after its eradica tion, though - revisionists have a point - it is possible to argue that the loss of Malagasy Cactus was by no means its only cause.73 On other points, the early twenty-first century renarrations offer fresh and important insights. They open up prickly pear invasiveness for popular debate within local communities. They also disclose the fact of Malagasy Cactus survival (at infinitely reduced levels), bringing the case study into line with scientific models of biological invasion. Both these issues remained screened off in 1980s narrative.74 At the same time there are issues in Malagasy Cactus historiography that neither the traditional 'nationalist' narrative nor the revisionist narratives ad dress. Most obviously, the 1980s narrative glosses over important social dif ferentiation in how Karembola in the 1920s and 1930s experienced the death of Malagasy Cactus by narrating it as a collective trauma. While it is beyond the scope of this present essay to report the archival evidence, it is clear that the plant's eradication had uneven impacts both within communities and between communities, depending partly on access to other resources, itself a function of locality, rank, gender and age. This is not to say that the narrative of flight, death and pauperisation I collected in the 1980s was 'false' memory. Archival records confirm the historical authenticity of such narrative as generic statements. But the idea of a collective trauma, in the sense that all Karembola suffered and suffered in equal measure, is open to challenge. If differential impacts were not revealed in narrative produced in the early 1980s, it was partly because the nar rators were the survivors (or their descendants) or, more precisely, since those who escaped to more fertile parts of the island were also survivors, those who survived and subsequently prospered in their homeland.

Informants in the 1980s so invariably described Malagasy Cactus as 'dead' (mate) that I had believed the plant to be extinct, a misconception that much scientific literature does little to correct: see e.g. M. Julien and M. Griffiths, Biological Control of Weeds. A World Catalogue of Agents and Their Target Weeds (Wallingford: CAB International, 1999), p. 49.

The story had few individu ated characters. It was organised around a collective 'we' in which Karembola past and present were merged. Early twenty-first century narrative does little to address this lacuna. While discord around raketamena in the present seems to have opened up the intel lectual space to question the long-standing idea of the death of Malagasy Cactus as a collective trauma, and to speculate on the kind of intracommunity struggles that might (but only might) have once attended Malagasy Cactus, there was still a striking lack of personal detail in the accounts. Even narrators like Celestine who expressed their fears by drawing links between their present reliance on raketamena and what happened when Malagasy Cactus died, spoke in broad historical sweeps and were unable to provide particularised histories for named victims of the famine. They may be the destitute of Karembola society now but they too are the descendants of those who survived then. Some of the data suggest interesting connections between individual auto biographical memory and collective memory. Anthropologist Benedict Anderson proposes that the presence of a narrative is an index of people having forgotten the original formative experience. Having to 'have already forgotten' tragedies of which one needs unceasingly to be 'reminded', he argues, is a characteristic device in the construction of nationalism.76 Looking at communal narrative about Malagasy Cactus from the 1980s, the highly impersonal narration is suggestive of Anderson's argument. This really was a stylised, homogenised, dare I say fossilised, social or collective memory that had lost the immediacy of original experience. Yet the extremely diverse and highly individualistic memory of twenty years later suggests a more complicated trajectory between memory and narrative than that Anderson outlines, as narrators like Zomana zigzagged back from communal narrative to recover original experience, finding all kinds of fresh connections between the present and the past. It is now possible to see that, while collective storytelling may have dominated public narrative in the 1980s, individual autobiographical memory of original experience survived, latent, private, unvoiced. As anthropologist Maurice Bloch has argued, it is important not to overlook the distinction between collective or social memory and individual autobiographical memory. The latter may retain elements that collective memory has 'forgotten', making them available decades later as a resource for local knowledge to 'recover and reuse'.77 75.

An other instant of active re-remembering occurred when Vontana, reminiscing in his little timber house, observed: You know, there was something unusual about Malagasy Cactus. The fruits grew one on top of the other, at times leaves also appeared in the chains.78 Eighteen months earlier, while working in the Paris Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, I had found an unpublished sketch of Malagasy Cactus recording precisely this pattern of growth. Made by colonial botanist Perrier de la Bathie, an accompanying note in his hand describes how these curious multi-headed chains eventually grew so heavy that they caused the branch to droop.79 This example (where a detail retained by individual memory is corroborated by in dependent evidence) suggests that by careful triangulation it might be possible to move beyond a view that draws on memory to explore contested values and contested places to one that asks objective questions about plant biology and landscape history.80 Such a methodology stands in stark opposition to approaches which advo cate the collection of oral memory primarily to gain insights into sociocultural perceptions and values, a 'sense', a 'feel', a 'flavour' of what events meant to the people involved. Historian Pier Larson expressly warns that 'mining social memory for nuggets of evidentiary "raw material", once proposed as the proper treatment of oral tradition, is fraught with problems and contradictions'.81 Of course social memory embodies its own interpretations and meanings that histo rians must take seriously in their professional reconstructions. But there is equal danger in an overly holistic approach. Evidence presented here suggests that it is precisely the odd detail that has not been integrated into coherent narrative that may be more reliable whereas the 'feel', the 'sense' to the story - precisely because it is a story - may be the least reliable. In a context where more powerful actors are beginning to use Malagasy Cactus history with a view to framing conservationist policy for practical interventions in alien species in Madagascar, it would be particularly untimely to pass over local oral evidence in favour of written documents.82 The challenge rather is to 78.

It also means paying closer at tention to the articulation of social and individual memory than historians and anthropologists are generally minded to pay. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
