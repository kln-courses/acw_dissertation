<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALEXANDRA HAENDEL THE DIVINE IN THE HUMAN WORLD: SCULPTURE AT TWO TENTH-CENTURY TEMPLES AT ANGKOR INTRODUCTION This paper analyzes the sculpture of the tenth-century East Mebon and Pre Rup temples at Angkor.1 Despite being large and beautiful structures these two temples have not received much scholarly attention, and a close examination of them is needed. If we are to interpret these sacred sites correctly, we must consider their sculpture not in isolation but in relation to its location and function within the temple compound. The temples, founded in 952 CE and 961 CE respectively by King R?jendravarman (r. 944-968 CE ) as his central temples, share various characteristics (figs. 1, 2).1 Architecturally, they are very sim ilar compounds. Both temples consist of two concentric enclosures with enclosure walls, punctuated at the cardinal points by entrance gates (gopuras). The outer enclosure wall of the East Mebon is 120 meters on each side, that of Pre Rup 130 (east-west) by 120 (north-south) meters. In the outer enclo sure, long halls can be found which were used for various practical purposes, for instance storage or communal activities, with additional long halls in the inner enclosure at Pre Rup. Moreover, at Pre Rup we find six large sanctuaries in two groups of three along the eastern side of the outer enclosure. These shrines are contemporary with the temple, albeit unfinished. In the inner enclosure of both tem ples a number of tower shrines (prasats) were built. At the center of both temples is a quincunx of shrines, the central one of which is slightly larger than the four surrounding ones and raised on an addi tional platform. At the East Mebon the shrines are raised on a two-meter-high platform, whereas at Pre Rup they are set on top of a twelve-meter-high lat?rite pyramid with three tiers, the lowest of which consists of two levels. At both temples these central prasats are surrounded by smaller ones: eight at the East Mebon - two in each cardinal direction - and twelve at Pre Rup on the lowest level of the pyramid. In addition to these shrines, rectangular buildings can be found in the inner enclosure: five at the East Mebon, one in each corner with an additional one north of the south-east building ; and two facing the pyramid on either side of the eastern walkway at Pre Rup. These buildings are commonly called "libraries," although their function seems to have been much broader, as will be discussed later in this article. i Research for this publication was partly funded through a private grant by J. Clark and R. Hannan, to whom I would like to express my deep gratitude. This article is to some extent based on my dissertation, "The Temples of King R?jen dravarman: Tenth Century Architecture at Angkor" (Ph.D. diss., School of Oriental and African Studies, London, 2004). 2 I would like to express my gratitude to the Monash Asia Institute for facilitating the production of these maps. 213</page><page sequence="2">The temples' sculptures and sculptural fragments, all of which are comparatively well documented regarding provenance within the temples and location at present, can be dated stylistically to the tenth, eleventh, and late twelfth to early thirteenth centuries CE. The founding inscriptions of both temples constitute the longest inscriptions not just at Angkor or in Southeast Asia, but in India as well. Despite their length of 218 and 298 stanzas respectively, only a few verses refer to the icons housed in the temples: one stanza merely lists the icons, while several others give more detailed information, for instance, in whose memory the sculptures were dedicated. This study marks the first attempt to analyze this information in order to determine the original placement of the icons and thus to illumi nate the use of the sites by priests and devotees. In undertaking this task, the researcher faces various problems. One is looting, which has gone on for centuries. By the time the French experts of the Conservation d'Angkor restored most of the tem ples in the 1920s and 1930s,3 the depositories with their precious objects had been dug up, images had disappeared, and even parts of the decorative elements of the temples themselves had been cut out. Though many objects still remained in situ and are listed in the restoration reports, usually accom panied by photographs, the documentation is far from complete. Moreover, the documentation of the objects at the Conservation d'Angkor in Siem Reap is deficient,4 so that it is often difficult to trace the history of specific items from their original discovery to their present locations. Nevertheless, combining the references in the reports, the photographs, and the inventory forms, the researcher does have a valuable database, which so far has not been utilized to its fullest with regard to the East Mebon and Pre Rup. This article will first introduce and examine the objects found at the two temples, and subsequently reconstruct and analyze the significance of their original placement within the spiritual conceptualization of the sites. 2. EPIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND PHYSICAL REMAINS The founding inscriptions of the East Mebon and Pre Rup contain several stanzas referring to the images established at the temples: the East Mebon inscription contains three such verses, the Pre Rup inscription six. Both inscriptions contain a summary stanza stating the dedication of the temple and mentioning all statues, as well as several stanzas that provide additional information about the icons. Apart from one stanza from Pre Rup, the placement of the images is not described. Generally, the only evidence of original image location still in situ at both temples are pedestals and fragments of sculp tures; very few statues have survived, and have long been removed from the sites. Most of the sculp tural remains from the East Mebon and Pre Rup are now kept in the Conservation d'Angkor in Siem Reap. Tables 1 and 2 present an overview of the objects found at the East Mebon and Pre Rup respec tively, and their likely relationship to the inscriptions. 3 The East Mebon was restored under H. Marchai and M. Glaize from 1935 to 1939. Pre Rup was restored under H. Mar chai and G. Trouv? between 1930 and 1935. 4 In 1997 the ?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient published an inventory of all the objects stored in the Conservation d'Angkor, giving a short description and the location of each. Unfortunately, not only are individual entry forms miss ing from the inventory, but due to recent restoration work at the Conservation's storage buildings, the locations given are no longer valid, and many relocated sculptures can no longer be found. 214</page><page sequence="3">2.1 The East Mebon The inscription from the East Mebon contains all the information regarding sculptures towards the end: its last stanza gives the dedication of the temple and the main icons, while two earlier ones men tion several statues in more detail. Overall, the temple contains a limited number of the sculptures mentioned in the inscription, as well as other fragments found throughout the temple. All these stat ues seem to have followed the original religious program of the founding king. 2.1.i Epigraphic data Three stanzas of the East Mebon inscription mention the erection of sculptures, without stating their exact location: CCVII This glorious king, knower of stability, established these two images of ?iva and Parvat? (?ivayo) for the good of his parents, who had attained the same status as &amp;iva (sasth?nat?).5 CCVIII And the great warrior, who accomplished the duties of a king, erected this statue of Visnu (Catur bhujasya) and Brahma (Mah?bhujas), together with eight lingas of the eight forms of ?iva. CCXVIII In the saka year counted by the Vasus, the mountains and the dice (874), on a propitious day, the eleventh of the fortnight of the M?gha, (the karana) Bhava having commenced since an instant, the moon arriving in the middle of the Taurus, this linga of Siva, called Sri R?jendresvara, has found here a perfect stability, together with these statues of Sauri (Visnu), Gaur? (Parvat?), Gir?sa (Siva), and Brahma.6 The images mentioned here are the five images of the central towers - Siva, Parvat?, Visnu, Brahma, and the Sri R?jendresvara li?ga ? and the eight li?gas. Despite being mentioned twice, only one Siva and Parvat? pair and one Visnu and Brahma pair were dedicated. The first reference to the pairs (stan zas CCVII and CCVIII ) represents a short explanation, with the final stanza (CCXVIII ) containing a simple enumeration. A similar arrangement can be found in the Pre Rup inscription, and seems to have been the usual structure of King R?jendravarman's inscriptions.7 5 Unless indicated otherwise, all English translations of the Sanskrit stanzas in this publication were done by Prof. K. Bhattacharya, formerly Directeur de Recherche at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Bhattacharya for allowing me to cite his translations here, which initially appeared in my Ph.D. thesis. However, I take full responsibility for my arguments and interpretations of the data (including the translations). 6 Louis Finot, "Mebon: Inscriptions d'Angkor," Bulletin de l'?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient 25, 3-4 (1925): 331-352. 7 See Haendel, "Temples of King R?jendravarman," chap. 5, for a more detailed analysis of the inscriptions of King R?jendravarman and their internal structure. 215</page><page sequence="4">Stanza CCVII mentions images erected to commemorate King R?jendravarman's parents. The Sanskrit, nime ime dve ?ivayos siv?ya, indicates that the images of Siva and Parvat? were created for the merit of the king's father and mother respectively, "who had attained the same status as Siva (sasth? nat?)." The term sasth?nat? refers to a fourfold system of unity between God and deceased relatives, already known in the Satapatha Br?hmana. In ascending order they are: (i) s?lokyalsalokat? - participation of the deceased in the divine realm (2) s?m?pya - proximity to the deity (3) s?r?pya ? communality of form of the deity and the deceased (4) s?yujya - being one with the divine.8 The level indicated in the East Mebon inscription, sasth?nat?, can be identified with either s?lokya or s?yujya, depending on whether the emphasis is on place or status. If intended to denote place, sth?na would indicate s?lokya, the first stage; if intended to denote status, sth?na would refer to s?yujya, unity and the highest stage. Considering that these were royal ancestors being commemorated, it seems likely that the fourth stage was intended. Given the age of the concepts and the widespread references to them in Indian texts, the mention o? sasth?nat? in this stanza does not indicate ancestor veneration in the context of the East Mebon inscription at all, but is evidence for ancestor commemoration, as prac ticed all over South and Southeast Asia - a clear indication that the East Mebon cannot be classified as an ancestor temple. Stanza CCVIII refers to Visnu and Brahma, which L. Finot interpreted as a reference to an image of the birth of Brahma.9 A representation in the round would have been very unusual, as the birth of Brahma was generally carved on lintels and pediments. Rather, the use of the singular for the gram matical object in the Sanskrit seems to constitute a somewhat infrequent grammatical form, as the dual10 could have been used without changing the rhythm of the verse. Since this verse contains only one accusative object, nim?m im?m ("this image"), both genitives, i.e. the names of the two images "Mah?bhujas" and "Caturbhujasya," can be seen to relate to that object. The comprehensibility of the verse is assured because of the logical grammatical relationship between the different elements.11 There 8 Louis Renou and Jean Filliozat, L'Inde Classique: Manuel des ?tudes Indiennes.

The dual is used whenever two objects are being referred to, whether natural pairs like hands or, as in the present case, two otherwise unrelated items. 11 "Da im Ai. die grammatische (und logische) Beziehung der Satzglieder schon durch die grammatische Form v?llig bestimmt ist, so sind einer v?llig freien Wortstellung durch die R?cksicht auf Verst?ndlichkeit keine Schranken gezo gen."

The second part of stanza CCVIII mentions the eight li?gas of ?iva having eight m?rti, ling?n yath?st?v api c?stam?rtteh. Physical evidence for the establishment of these li?gas can be found in sev eral temples, and even though they are sometimes referred to as "sculptures" in the inscriptions, sculp turally they are unambiguously li?gas.11 2.1.2 The physical evidence As stated above, these stanzas of the East Mebon inscription mention thirteen sculptures. In what fol lows, the icons will be dealt with in the order they appear in stanza CCXVIII.13 Nothing remains of the central &amp;ri R?jendresvara li?ga, and it is probable that it was looted. How ever, parts of its pedestal were assembled outside the central sanctuary by the restoration team of the Conservation d'Angkor in 1935 from pieces scattered around the platform (fig. 3).14 The pedestal is 180 centimeters square and 90 centimeters high, and the extant top piece clearly shows an octagonal hole at the center, once intended to hold a ?inga. The pedestal would have fit easily into the approximately 190-centimeter-square indentation in the floor of the central sanctuary. As for the locations of the other four images mentioned in stanza CCXVIII, the prasats in the northeast, northwest, and southwest corners contain pedestals, albeit not in situ, but leaning in all cases against the inner western wall of the shrine. All three pedestals are 120 centimeters square and about 84 centimeters high, fitting the indentations in the floor, which are about 130 centimeters square. All the top pieces are missing, but the holes at the center were clearly carved to receive the tenon of an image. The northeastprasat now houses a tenon with feet, which seem to belong to the Bayon style: carved in a somewhat crude way they are stout with thick ankles. As for the images themselves, only evidence for the Brahma exists. During the restoration of the southeast corner prasat a round pedestal was found, similar to those found in the temples of Phnom Krom, Phnom Bok, and Trapeang Pong which supported statues of Brahma. The remains of the pedestal can still be seen today, as well as its round yonJ, which lies broken at the base of the central platform (figs. 4a, b). In addition, the restoration reports mention fragments of a Brahma head with four faces found on the platform north of the southeast tower,15 and fragments of a male statue south of the east stairs of the central platform.16 Due to their proximity to the yon? these fragments may be parts of the original Brahma image. Unfortunately, no photographs exist of either the head or the other pieces, but according to the restoration report of November 1935 the head at least was stylistically con 12 These represent the astam?rti, the eight manifest forms of Siva that constitute the universe : earth, water, fire, air, ether, sun, moon, and the sacrificer. 13 This subsection only attempts to prove the existence of icons. Their placement and the ritual path of the devotees will be discussed later. 14 Rapports sur les travaux executes dans le groupe d} Angkor (Siem Reap: ?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient, Conservation d'Angkor, 1922-1954), November 1935,121. 15 Rapport d'Angkor, November 1935,121. 16 Rapport d'Angkor, January 1936,152. 217</page><page sequence="6">temporary with the temple. When I visited the Conservation d'Angkor it was impossible to find any of these fragments, so a definitive identification of the pieces cannot be made at this point. The inven tory of the Conservation d'Angkor also notes that a standing image of Brahma with four arms was found at the East Mebon.17 Unfortunately, no further details are given, but the image, now in Siem Reap, may have originally been placed in the southeast shrine. Apart from the five central icons, stanza CCVIII also mentions eight lingas of Siva. Physical evi dence for them is present mainly in the form of pedestals in the eight small brick towers surrounding the central platform. These pedestals are 60 centimeters square and 44 centimeters high, with an octagonal hole in the top piece to fit the octagonal central part of the linga. At present, these pedestals are in situ in the prasats in the east-south, south-west, and west-north towers,18 with four additional ones in the central sanctuary. Three of them still have a top piece with an octagonal hole (east-south and south-west towers, and one inside the central sanctuary); in 1935 the two eastern towers still bore their li?gas.19 2.2 Pre Rup The founding inscription of Pre Rup, at 298 stanzas, is the longest Sanskrit inscription known, and, like the East Mebon inscription, contains the dedication and information on the sculptures towards the end. Pre Rup is a large foundation and housed more icons than the East Mebon. In addition, some of the later sculptures seem not to have been dedicated within the same religious background as the original foundation. 2.2.1 Epigraphic data The Pre Rup inscription contains six stanzas mentioning twenty-five images erected at the temple: CCLXXVII The king established here the linga ?ri R?jendrabhadresvara, as if it was the smiling face of Siva, glad to proclaim highly his glory with four shining faces, with these four ravishing images of Gauri (Parvat?), Saur? (Visnu), and ?svara (Siva), in 883 saka. CCLXXVIII For his own prosperity he placed this ?svara R?jendravarmesvara in the region of Agni, provided with the divine attributes such as tenuity and accompanied by the eight other gods (dikp?lak?s), beginning with Indra ? who was, as it were, his own kingly appearance (bh?p?labh?va). 17 Documentation Conservation d'Angkor (Siem Reap: ?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient, 1997), no. 3507, 4175. 18 The locations of the small prasats at the East Mebon are described using two compass points: the first indicates the cardinal direction in which the shrine is placed; the second is the half within this cardinal direction. For instance, east south refers to the south tower in the east half of the inner enclosure. This allows a specific identification without long descriptions. 19 Rapport d'Angkor, March 1936,174. 2l8</page><page sequence="7">CCLXXIX And he has constructed also this R?jendravisvar?pa, Hari, lovely, having the aspect of the Omni present, here in this temple which is like an accumulation of all the beauty of the three worlds. CCLXXX He erected here the daughter of the mountain, producer of fortune, for the benefit of Jayadev?, mother of &amp;ri Harsavarman and younger sister of his mother, who had attained heaven. CCLXXXI This king of kings founded this ?svara R?jendravarmadevesvara for the prosperity of his younger relative, the king ?ri Harsavarman. CCLXXXII Accompanied by the brilliant images of Sar?gin and other gods, he erected the eight images of the god astam?rti, charming, recognizable by their ten particular marks, to some extent pouring with profusion the nectar spread by the moon on the head of Siva. Stanza CCLXXVII mentions the central li?ga Sri R?jendrabhadresvara and names another three images - Gauri, Sauri, and ?svara - though it explicitly states that there are four images. This is due to the internal structure of the section on the images; the subsequent stanzas provide more detailed descriptions of the images merely enumerated here, as will become clear. The four images described in stanzas CCLXXVIII-CCLXXXI are those of Parvat?, Visnu, and two Sivas. Stanza CCLXXVII only refers to a Parvat?, a Visnu, and Siva. Therefore, in the summary stanza CCLXXVII, the two images of Siva are only mentioned once for stylistic reasons. According to stanza CCLXXVIII, the king established the image ?svara R?jendravarmesvara for his own merit and installed it in the southeast (corner) tower. G. C d?s initially translated this part ofthe stanza thus: "asifit [the image] had been his [the king's] own royal substance,"20 and so assumed the resemblance ofthe statue to the king. Subsequently, however, he further developed his ideas on portrait statues, and stated that commemorative images were not carved to resemble the person they commemorate.21 The issue ofthe dvarap?la, the door guardians, mentioned in this stanza will be dealt with later in this article. An image of R?jendravisvar?pa is mentioned in stanza CCLXXIX, and seems to have been placed in commemoration of Visvar?pa, a somewhat legendary ancestor ofthe king. In his genealogy in the Pre Rup inscription, King R?jendravarman refers to Visvar?pa in stanza VII as the husband ofthe ksatriya Sarasvat?, and states in stanza XIV that Visvar?pa studied the Vedas: 20 George C d?s, Inscriptions du Gambodge (Hanoi, Paris: ?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient, 1937), 1:102-140. 21 George C d?s, "La Destination Fun?raire des Grands Monuments Khm?rs. ?tudes Cambodgiennes, no. 33," Bulletin de l'?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient 40 (1940): 315-343. This only changes during the reign of King Jayavarman VII, when indeed portrait statues can be found. George C d?s, "Le portrait dans Tart Khmer, " Arts Asiatiques 7, 3 (i960): 179-198. 219</page><page sequence="8">XIV Thanks to the study of the Veda practiced and to the triple asceticism endured formerly by the brahmin Visvar?pa, by Dviveda with his wife (Vedavat?), and by all the kings of their descent, thanks to all that, he [R?jendravarman] was in his family like Hari, the Supreme God, of the descendants of the solar race.22 These are the only occurrences of the name Visvar?pa, and they seem to refer to the same person. Visvar?pa is apparently commemorated at Pre Rup because of his instigation of asceticism, which ulti mately made possible the birth of R?jendravarman like a "Hari" in his solar family. Though the king's connection to Visvar?pa is somewhat nebulous, the two subsequent stanzas and their images are dedicated to close relatives of the king: stanza CCLXXX to Jayadev?, mother of Sri Harsavarman and younger sister of his mother; and stanza CCLXXXI to the former king and cousin of King R?jendravarman, Harsavarman II, who reigned for two years before R?jendravarman himself ascended the throne. The images mentioned in these stanzas are commemorative, and the names of two of the male stat ues combine part of King R?jendravarman's name with their own. King Harsavarman's name is omit ted entirely from the name of the statue founded in his honor, a practice widespread not just in South east Asia but also in India, as sculptures do not necessarily have to carry the name of the person com memorated. What is more important than the name in this respect is the intention of commemorating the person. Moreover, all stanzas actually mention for whom the image was established.23 The final stanza to refer to icons is stanza CCLXXXII, which names ?arngin and other gods, as well as the eight images of the god astam?rti. This stanza definitely indicates the installation of eight li?gas of Siva, but also possibly those of several other images. While the "brilliant images of Sar?gin and other gods" could refer to the images of the preceding stanzas, they may also indicate additional sculptures, possibly erected in the smaller sanctuary towers. As will be argued below, the second alter native seems more likely, as there is in fact evidence for more than eight lingas in the small brick tow ers on the first level of the pyramid. 2.2.2 The physical evidence In total, the Pre Rup inscription mentions twenty-five statues established in the temple in six stan zas, but only gives the location of nine of them. In the following, the icons will be discussed in the order they are mentioned in the inscription. The linga Sri R?jendrabhadresvara should originally have been located in the central sanctuary. However, the pedestal currently in place there originated from the intermediate level of the lowest terrace of the pyramid: it is the base of the north lion of the western staircase.24 This is immediately obvious when one considers the size of the pedestal (150 centimeters square, 75 centimeters high) and 22 C d?s, Inscriptions du Cambodge, i: 79-107. 23 Personal communication with Prof. K. Bhattacharya, to whom I would like to express my gratitude for clarifying this issue. 24 The other seven bases are still in situ, though some ofthe lions are missing. 220</page><page sequence="9">Fig. i East Mebon Temple, Angkor. Founded 952 CE by King R?jendravarman (r. 944-968 CE). The five central icons mentioned in the founding inscription were housed in the quincunx of towers at the center ofthe compound, raised on a common platform. The central prasat contained the lifiga R?jendresvara; the four surrounding prasats housed statues of Siva, Parvat?, Visnu, and Brahma. In the eight smaller towers surrounding the central platform eight litigas dedicated to the eight manifest forms of Siva were founded. Further images, of which only fragments remain, were found throughout the compound. However, their original placement cannot be given with certainty.

Fig. 2 Pre Rup Temple, Angkor. Founded 961 CE by King R?jendravarman (r. 944?968 CE). The founding inscription of Pre Rup mentions a number of icons established in the temple. As at the East Mebon, the five central shrines housed the linga Sri R?jendrabhadresvara, two sculptures of Siva, a Parvat?, and a Visnu. In the twelve small prasats on the lowest level of the pyramid stood eight lingas for the astam?rti, the eight manifest forms of Siva, together with images ofSar?gin and other gods. Throughout the temple compound fragments of other sculptures were found, but their placement can only be speculated on. The largest of these icons are two life-size Bayon-style statues found next to the northeast corner sanctuary and in the outer north gopura. Again, their original placement can only be assumed.

Ofthe original pedestal only a fragment of its yont remains, next to the southeast corner tower on the first level ofthe pyramid, with an estimated side length of about 120 centimeters (fig. 6). Regarding the linga itself, the restoration team found a 135-centimeter-high linga north ofthe stairs ofthe pyramid25 and placed it at the bottom ofthe eastern staircase (fig. 7). Considering its size, it was very important and may have been the one in the central sanctuary. It was later removed from the temple and is now kept in the Conservation d'Angkor. The only contemporary evidence for the other central icons is the pedestal in the southwest corner prasat (fig. 8). It is 140 centimeters square and 107 centimeters high. Stylistically, it is quite similar to the tripartite sandstone face of both the top level ofthe pyramid and the double base ofthe central prasat. A similar pedestal can be found molded in stucco supporting the eastern devat? at the north side of this sanctuary. At present, the other corner prasats contain no original pedestals. Ofthe origi nal pedestals, two broken ones were reassembled at the bottom ofthe pyramid, one next to the nandin base, the other near its southeast corner (fig. 9).26 The size and carvings of both pedestals are almost identical to those ofthe pedestal in the southwestern;?/, and it can be assumed that these two pedestals originated from the two eastern corner towers. Very little evidence remains ofthe icons themselves. Fragments of an image - parts of a face, two hands, and a leg - were discovered near the western part ofthe pyramid's southern staircase. The Rap port d'Angkor ascribes this image "without doubt" to one ofthe five central towers.27 But without a detailed description or photographs, or even the exact location where the fragments were found, noth ing can be said about this image, not even whether it was male or female. Considering the location, however, these pieces may have originated from the southeast corner tower and be part of the ?svara R?jendravarmesvara cited in stanza CCLXXVIII. As for the dikp?lak?s noted in the same stanza, two options for their placement seem possible: they could have replaced the carved guardians at the out side of the prasat, or been placed inside, next to the image of the ?svara R?jendravarmesvara. The guardians are all identical; they stand erect with one arm bent, possibly to hold a lance, and the other hanging at their side. Their headdresses all seem to consist of a diadem and a pointed cap. Conse quently, they do not seem to have represented the dikp?lak?s. Instead, these images may have been placed inside the tower around the icon of R?jendravarmesvara, as in the case ofthe dikp?lak?s still present at Phnom Rung, which were carved seated on their v?hanas on sandstone cubes (fig. 10a), or those at Wat Phu (fig. 10b).28 At present, inside the prasat at Pre Rup there is a 26-centimeter-high sandstone statue (fig. 10c), half-seated with the right knee up and the left hand on the left knee; the right hand, which is missing, may have held an attribute, similar to the yaksas at Banteay Srei (fig. iod). Regrettably, the image is badly damaged, with the head and arms missing and the rest heavily 25 Rapport d'Angkor, November 1931, 4. 26 Rapport d'Angkor, September 1933, 2. 27 Ibid. 28 The dikp?lak?s at both these sites are no longer in situ. At Phnom Rung, they are placed outside the central sanctu ary in their respective cardinal directions, whereas at Wat Phu they are merely placed next to each other behind the large Buddha in the central shrine. The representation ofthe deities varies at the two sites: at Phnom Rung they are carved on one side of a sandstone cube. At Wat Phu they are carved in the round on pedestals and are similar to the fragments still extant at Pre Rup. 237</page><page sequence="26">weathered. Hence, whether this statue was one of the dikp?lak?s is no longer discernible. A second, similar though broken image is located inside the so-called southern library. Judging from the attrib ute in its right hand, it may be Y?ma holding a fruit (fig. ioe). The only stylistically contemporary fragment of a sculpture from the central towers is a Visnu head, about 40 centimeters high found in 1923 (fig. 11).29 The head is bedecked with an elaborately carved diadem and tiered crown decorated with floral patterns and jewels. The hairline curves into points at the temples, and the top of the beard meets the center of the lower lip in a point. The eyebrows are almost straight, although they do not form a continuous line, and the eyes are almond-shaped, in a straight line. In view of the size of the head, the image must have been about 140 to 150 centimeters high, which indicates an important statue placed within the inner enclosure. Thus, this head seems to be part of the original R?jendravisvar?pa image referred to in stanza CCLXXIX. Finally, evidence for the eight images of the god astam?rti and the images of ?ar?gin and other gods mentioned in stanza CCLXXXII must be evaluated. The eight astam?rti images were clearly rep resented by eight linga of Siva. The "brilliant images of Sar?gin and other gods" could refer to the images of the preceding stanzas. But since these images were already described in detail in earlier stan zas, this is more likely a reference to additional sculptures erected in the small sanctuary towers on the first level of the pyramid. Currently, five of the towers contain bases, about 60 centimeters square and 27 centimeters high, with another three bases in the two northern and the southwest central corner prasats. The two towers south of the east and west staircases respectively clearly house linga bases; the eastern one still contained its linga in 1922,30 as did one of the western towers.31 A third one might have been found east of the pyramid, but due to the lack of details in the respective restoration report this cannot be confirmed.32 2.3 Additional Objects Discovered in the Temples In addition to the images explicitly named in the inscriptions and evidence for them, fragments of other images were found at the temples. Most of these are small pieces, such as hands or heads, but some larger ones were discovered as well, dating from various periods. In the following discussion, the objects will be introduced according to the period they can stylistically be dated to. None of these sculptures are accompanied by inscriptions clarifying the circumstances of their establishment. 29 Even though the report mentions the "second" enclosure, it seems to be the inner one. In several instances the num bering ofthe enclosures is not followed correctly in the reports, with the inner enceinte being numbered the second one. Considering that the inner northeast corner building was being restored in 1922, the corner mentioned here seems to be the southeast one, next to the southeast corner building. Rapport d'Angkor, August 1923, no page. The present location of this head is unknown. 30 Rapport d'Angkor, October 1922,141. 31 Rapport d'Angkor, January 1932, 6. 32 Rapport d'Angkor, September 1934, 2. 238</page><page sequence="27">2.3.1 The East Mebon Two tenth-century sculptures were found in the northern ofthe two latente buildings in the south east corner ofthe inner enclosure. One is a 70-centimeter-high Ganesa wearing a tripartite diadem with a diamond-shaped band at the center, rows of pearls beneath, and dentate projections above (fig. 12). The sampot is severely damaged, but it shows pleats and the usual flap at the front; it is held up by a broad, rather simple belt typical ofthe so-called Pre Rup style. A pedestal found inside the same building and measuring 50 x 40 centimeters may have supported this sculpture. The second piece discovered in this edifice is a carved sandstone block about 170 x 60 centime ters.33 Unusually, the block is carved on both sides. The front shows a carving of nine devas\ the heav ily weathered back depicts seven ascetics (figs. 13a, b). Unfortunately, there is not much left ofthe rsis, who sit on a common platform and who appear to have their legs bound together. The rest of this side ofthe stone is plain. As for the deities, their diadems show the same tripartite pattern as that worn by Ganesa, and their sampots are similar to his, with pleats and a fold at the front. The deities are seated on their v?hanas, with a row of lotus petals beneath, an arrangement similar to that seen on the lintels ofthe East Mebon. Between the heads ofthe devas a floral pattern is carved, with three tips facing down ward, whereas the space between the bodies is uncarved. It is somewhat difficult to identify the deities due to the damaged state ofthe stone block. However, they seem to be, from left to right: S?rya in his horse-drawn chariot, Candra on a pedestal, Y?ma on his ox, a deity on an animal with two legs visi ble, Indra on Air?vata, possibly Kubera and Agni on their horse and ram respectively, R?hu in a whirl of clouds, and Ketu on a lion. The fourth deity is difficult to identify because the attributes are miss ing and the v?hana is badly damaged. Judging from what remains the v?hana seems to have had claws and could be a bird. Where the head ofthe v?hana should be, a half-circle of what look like feathers can be discerned, possibly indicating Skanda on his peacock. Another depiction ofthe nine deities, about 170 x 40 centimeters, was found inside the southern ofthe two southeast buildings (fig. 14).34 In comparison to the stone discussed above, several differ ences are obvious. First of all, the faces are more elongated and the diadems less refined. Another significant difference is the setting ofthe deities. In this carving there is no row of lotus petals at the bottom, merely horizontal lines, and the deities are set in clearly defined niches separated by pillars that support floral arches. Stylistically this depiction seems to date from the mid-eleventh century and represents a later addition. The deities are, from left to right: S?rya in a horse-drawn chariot, Candra on a pedestal, Y?ma on his ox, Skanda on a peacock, Indra on Air?vata, Kubera on a horse, Agni on a ram, R?hu in clouds, and Ketu on a lion. The third deity was identified by K. Bhattacharya as Brahma,35 which seems somewhat doubtful. Even though the v?hana is badly damaged, it does look very much like the v?hana ofthe sixth and seventh deities with hooves. Moreover, the attribute in the deity's right hand resembles a round object - the fruit associated with Y?ma. This god's mount is the buffalo, which would be in accord with the v?hana depicted. Thus it seems quite likely that the third deity is Y?ma, not Brahma. 33 Documentation Conservation d'Angkor, 3$o6. 34 Rapport d'Angkor, May 1936, 201. 35 Kamaleswar Bhattacharya, "Les 'Neuf Devas.' Notes d'Iconographie Khm?re, no. 2," Arts Asiatiques 3, 3 (1956): 189. 239</page><page sequence="28">During the restoration of the inner west gopura the Conservation d'Angkor team found the torso and legs of a female image;36 a month later they discovered the head and the feet, still with the tenon, in the southwest part of the second enclosure.37 Once the parts were reassembled, the image was 155 centimeters high and believed to be the Parvat? mentioned in the founding inscription (fig. 15).38 How ever, given the style of the icon this cannot be the case. Features indicating a later date are the fishtail motif and the curving waistline of the sampot, as well as the lozenge-shaped decorations of the belt. In addition, the curved eyebrows and almond-shaped eyes are eleventh-century styles. It seems therefore that features characteristic of the tenth century, i.e. the front flap of the pleated sampot and the tiered crown, have been utilized to copy the style of the temple for which the image was intended. At the northern entrance of the outer western gopura a mother goddess,39 44 centimeters high, was found along with a pedestal measuring 62 centimeters square and 47 centimeters high (fig. 16). The sculpture is crudely executed, with the sampot carved in a floral pattern. Unlike sculpture of the tenth century, the mother goddess does not have three lines under her breasts, but near her navel. Overall, the image looks unfinished, especially the child's right leg and the mother's sampot. Taking these fac tors into account, is seems likely that the image dates from a later period. The floral sampot suggests the Bayon style. However, given the rough execution of the piece it may even be later than that period and merely imitate Bayon characteristics. Several other pieces, which cannot be dated, were found in the inner enclosure. The largest is a 20 centimeter-high image of Ganesa, which is only mentioned in a restoration report, without being accompanied by a photograph.40 The other items are two bronze n?gas,41 one conch,42 and a hand hold ing a conch.43 Unfortunately, no detailed description or photographs of these items exist. Furthermore, the small size of the pieces makes it impossible to determine whether they were contemporary with the temple and where they might have been placed originally. 2.3.2 Pre Rup As at the East Mebon, many fragments of images and other objects were found at Pre Rup. The only piece contemporary with the temple, however, seems to be the fragment of a sandstone carving of seven ascetics placed on top of a sandstone block inside the south "library" (fig. 17).44 All of the ascetics are in very good condition, seated on individual pedestals with their hands together in front of their chests. 36 Rapport d'Angkor, May 1938,9 ; Documentation Conservation d'Angkor, 5422. The icon is now in the Conservation d'Angkor in Siem Reap. 37 Rapport d'Angkor, June 1938, 7. 38 Rapport d'Angkor, July 1938, 8; Rapport d'Angkor, May 1938, 9. 39 Documentation Conservation d'Angkor, 3747. 40 Rapport d'Angkor, April 1936,184. 41 Rapport d'Angkor, November 1936, 298 ; Rapport d'Angkor, May 1936, 202. 42 Rapport d'Angkor, November 1936, 298. 43 Rapport d'Angkor, May 1936, 202. 44 Rapport d'Angkor, October 1932,3 ; Documentation Conservation d'Angkor, 3867. The statement that the foundation block was made of latente is a mistake, as it is in fact made from sandstone. The issue ofthe "libraries" will be dealt with below. 240</page><page sequence="29">Their knee-length sampots show a broad frontal flap, possibly held together by a belt. Their hairdo is a miter of plaits, at the bottom of which is a ring of what looks like larger plaits to set it off. The rsis' faces are not as square as those ofthe East Mebon carving, and have quite realistic features, with curved eyebrows and downcast eyes. Because the representation ofthe ascetics from the East Mebon is so badly weathered, it is difficult to tell how similar these two carvings actually are. The Pre Rup carving is certainly much deeper, and each rsi sits on his own pedestal, in contrast to the common protrusion of the East Mebon representation. Because rsis in general do not show many characteristics that allow for dating, it is difficult to say whether the Pre Rup block was contemporary with the temple. The only indication for this is the style ofthe sampot, which nevertheless could have been copied if the piece is of a later date. Another fragment found in the inner enclosure is from a carving ofthe nine deities, showing four of them in a very damaged condition (fig. 18). The two devas on the left can nevertheless be identified as S?rya in his horse-drawn chariot and Candra on a pedestal. The fourth deity might be holding a hal ter in his right hand and would thus be Varuna. However, nothing can be said about his v?hana, which is completely destroyed. In between the devas pillars can be seen supporting triple floral arches. Styl istically, the block seems to belong to the mid-eleventh century and is, therefore, a later addition. Two images in the Bayon style were also found at Pre Rup. One, a Visnu statue, was discovered in the northeast corner ofthe upper platform (fig. 19a).45 Unfortunately, during a thunderstorm a month after it was found, the statue fell and the head separated.46 Characteristics ofthe Bayon style are the short sampot with a fishtail motif fixed with a broad belt carved with floral squares, the stout legs with knees carved quite realistically, the narrow torso, and the hairdo. The feet of this image, still attached to the tenon, were found inside the north "library"47 and are still kept there today (fig. 19b). The second image dating from the period of Jayavarman VII is a female image found in the west ern chamber ofthe outer north gopura. Unfortunately, no photograph is available, so we have to rely on the very short description given in the report. Apparently, the image had a nude torso, a lotus flower in each hand, and &amp; sampot decorated with flowers.48 After it was reassembled, the statue measured 132 centimeters high; it is now kept in the Conservation d'Angkor.49 The fact that the image holds lotuses in its hands prompted the conservators ofthe Conservation d'Angkor to identify her as Laksm?. Con sidering the possible date ofthe image, however, it could represent Prajn?p?ramit?, the name she is identified by in the 1997 Conservation inventory. Nevertheless, in light ofthe contemporary Visnu image found at Pre Rup, it is quite likely that the two images were established together as a couple, and this sculpture could indeed represent Laksm?. Regardless of who the image represents, it is note worthy that originally neither a Prajn?p?ramit? nor a Laksm? had been created, but a Parvat?. This raises the question of whether the benefactor ofthe later image was aware of this fact or not. During the reign of Jayavarman VII the language in use had not changed much from that ofthe inscriptions, 45 Rapport d'Angkor, March 1931, 7; Documentation Conservation d'Angkor, 2394. 46 Rapport d'Angkor, April 1931, 5. 47 Rapport d'Angkor, January 1932, 4. 48 Rapport d'Angkor, February 1935, 8; Documentation Conservation d'Angkor, 3398. 49 Rapport d'Angkor, December 1935,133. Unfortunately, it was impossible to gain permission to publish a photograph taken of the piece by the author in 2003. 241</page><page sequence="30">so a prospective donor could simply have read the Pre Rup foundation stele to identify the original sculptures. Thus it seems likely that the two images were indeed donated as a couple, irrespective of the original dedication of the towers. Because the icons are life size, it seems likely that they were indeed royal donations. But what is surprising is the fact that Jay avarman VII established two Visnuite images and not an Avalokitesvara and a Prajn?p?ramit?, as might be expected given his adherence to Mah?y?na Buddhism. However, this image may have been erected by his second wife, Queen Indradev?, for her late sister Queen J?yarajadev?, as suggested for the similar Laksm? image at Preah K0.50 As stated in stanza 59 of the Phimeanakas inscription,51 K. 485, Queen Jay arajadev? was instructed in Buddhism by her sister, and seems previously to have followed Brahmanism. After Queen Jayarajadev?'s death her sister placed images of her in all the towns according to stanza 96 of the Phimeanakas.52 Similarly, the Pre Rup figure could have been donated by Queen Indradev? for her late sister, representing her as a Brahmanical deity in accordance with her original Brahmanical religion. In addition to these rather large fragments and icons, numerous small, undateable pieces were found throughout the temple. East of the pyramid a depository with seventeen alveoli was found, along with the fragments of a hand;53 no more details are given about these objects. Inside the north ern "library" a 90-centimeter-high linga was found, which, due to its size, would have been too large to fit in any of the small brick sanctuaries. Since no pedestal suitable to carry this linga has been identified, nothing can be said as to its potential placement.54 Near the inner eastern gopura a small male statue without head or arms was unearthed,55 of which no photograph exists. In the inventory of the Conservation d'Angkor, however, the image is dated to the late eleventh century. The head of the figure may have been the one found inside the east gopura several years earlier.56 Several objects were found in the outer enclosure as well, although most are only small fragments. In between the two eastern gopuras the hand of a small statue holding a vase in the form of a flacon was discovered,57 and in between the outer east gopura and the southern prasats a small sandstone head with a chignon and an iron arrowhead were found.58 If the hand is in fact DCA 2356, it too was made of sand stone and could be part of the same image as the head with the chignon found nearby only a month later. However, the inventory of the Conservation d'Angkor has no entry for the head, which makes it impossible to trace. At the northwest corner of the outer south gopura a bronze thumb, a toe, and one bracelet were found, with the rest of the image missing.59 Again, due to the lack of either an inven tory number or an entry form, these fragments cannot be traced. 50 Helen I.

Once again, no detailed description or DCA number is given in the inventory, and the statue cannot be located. 3. THE ORIGINAL PLACEMENT OF THE ICONS As we have seen, the East Mebon and Pre Rup inscriptions give no details regarding the original place ment of the icons, except for Pre Rup stanza CCLXX VIII, which places the ?svara R?jendravarmesvara and the dikp?lak?s in the southeast. Consequently, the original location of the other images must be surmised. In order to infer the arrangement of images, two main elements of the temples have to be taken into account: the pedestals and the decorative elements. First, the pedestals must be examined to deter mine which kind of sculpture ? a linga or a statue ? they could have supported in terms of shape and size. Pedestals intended for lingas usually have an octagonal hole at the center of their top piece to accommodate the octagonal central part of the linga. In contrast, pedestals for images have square holes to contain the tenons. The placement of images can also be inferred from the decorative elements of the sanctuary towers, such as the guardian figures carved in the interpilaster spaces. Towers with male guardians generally housed male divinities, and those with female guardians female goddesses. There are exceptions, however, and some towers with female guardians seem to have housed male deities, as at Banteay Srei,61 but not vice versa. The order in which the deities are mentioned in the inscriptions seems to be of no relevance to their placement. In the East Mebon inscription, the two pairs &amp;iva/Par vat? and Visnu/Brahm? are mentioned separately from stanza CCXVIII, which names all four icons: ?auri (Visnu), Gaur? (Parvat?), Gir?sa (Siva), and Brahma. Similarly, in the Pre Rup inscription the order in which the deities are named in stanza CCLXXVII, Gaur?, Saur? and ?svara, does not corre spond to the order in the stanzas following this first one; these latter stanzas list them as ?svara R?jen dravarmesvara, R?jendravisvar?pa, Jayadev?, and ?svara R?jendravarmadevesvara. We know that the Sri R?jendresvara and Sri R?jendrabhadresvara lingas stood in the central sanc tuaries. King R?jendravarman's reign is somewhat unusual in that he established two li?gas rather than only one, as was customary. The Sri R?jendresvara of the East Mebon can be directly compared to earlier li?gas, namely the &amp;ri Indresvara of King Indravarman at Bakong and the Yasodharesvara of King Yasovarman on Phnom Bakheng. These earlier kings had consecrated only one linga each, a fact that can be explained in terms of the state cult centered on the state temple.62 But why did King 59 Rapport d'Angkor, February 1933, 2. 60 Rapport d'Angkor, March 1929, 591. 61 At this temple, obviously for reasons of symmetry, the central tower is guarded by male devas, and the side prasats, originally housing an image of Visnu and a Siva li?ga, by devat?s.

That Pre Rup was built as a repre sentation of Mount Meru is not surprising, since it was clearly intended as the central temple ofthe kingdom, comparable to earlier temples such as Bakong and Bakheng. The East Mebon, however, is more unusual. Taking into account references made to this temple in other inscriptions by King R?jen dravarman, they all mention the five towers or even their likeness to Mount Meru rising from the ocean. The Bat Chum inscription relates: XIV In the middle of this ocean, which is the sacred pond of Yasodhara, on a mountain erected by him, a summit like the one of Meru, covered withprasats, palaces, houses, and joy, he erected a Viri?ca, a Dev?, an Isa, a S?rngin, and a linga of Siva.63 A subsequent stanza ofthe same inscription asserts: XXV At the center ofthe pond of Yasodhara, on a mountain enflamed by Sri, resembling Meru, he erected....64 The East Mebon thus seems to have been intended as a literal representation ofthe macrocosm, which could be easily achieved given its location at the center of the East Baray. In order to complete this representation, the temple needed a quincunx of towers at the center, with a linga inside the central sanctuary. With respect to the linga &amp;ri R?jendrabhadresvara at Pre Rup, the significance of its name, refer ring to Bhadresvara, "in some sort the national divinity ofthe Kambuja,"65 must be examined in fur ther detail. Bhadresvara as an epithet of Siva can be found in various Indian sources, for instance in the ?abdakalpadruma, and was popular not only in India during the fourth and fifth centuries CE, but also in Champa, where King Bhadravarman founded a Bhadresvara at Mi Son. In the context of Pre Rup it is important to consider that Bhadresvara is used as an epithet of Siva, and has nothing to do with King Bhadravarman of Champa. Bhadresvara was common in India as well, and adopted in Cambo dia along with many other names for &amp;iva.66 Bhattacharya has called Bhadresvara the "national divin ity" of Cambodia because ofthe frequency with which it is mentioned in Cambodian inscriptions of all periods, and the particular sanctity ascribed to its shrine at Wat Phu.67 This place, also called 63 George C d?s, "Les Inscriptions de Bat Chum," Journal Asiatique 10,12 (1908): 228-239, stanza A14. 64 Ibid., 235-250, stanza C25; the rest of the stanza is damaged. 65 Kamaleswar Bhattacharya, Les Religions brahmaniques dans l'ancien Cambodge.

This bears witness to the significance of Wat Phu and its Bhadresvara over the centuries. 244</page><page sequence="33">Li?gaparvata,68 received its sanctity from the combination of two natural features: the sv?yambhuva li?ga on top of the mountain behind the temple, and the natural spring, which never dries up, right next to the shrine (figs. 20a, b). Sv?yambhuvalingas are regarded as the most holy and potent lingas, as they represent a natural manifestation of Siva.69 This fertility is also ascribed to water, making this hill in southern Laos one of the most sacred and potent places throughout Kambujadesa. Moreover, Wat Phu was long regarded as a place for asceticism and meditation. Therefore, by combining his name with that of Bhadresvara to associate himself with Siva, and placing this icon in the most important sanctuary of his reign because of its correlation to Wat Phu and its particular sacredness, King R?jen dravarman utilized an extremely potent amalgamation of spiritual and political legitimization.70 Religion and politics cannot be separated in any discussion of Angkor. The king is part of the cos mos, at the center of his kingdom, and, though human, he has superhuman traits. This is described by Manu: (3) For when this world was without a king and people ran about in all directions out of fear, the Lord emitted a king in order to guard this entire [realm], (4) taking lasting elements from Indra, the Wind, Yama, the Sun, Fire, Varuna, the Moon, and [Kubera] the Lord of Wealth. (5) Because a king is made from particles of these lords of the gods, therefore he surpasses all living beings in brilliant energy, (6) and, like the Sun, he burns eyes and hearts, and no one on earth is able even to look at him. (7) Through his special power he becomes Fire and Wind; he is the Sun and the Moon, and he is [Yama] the King of Justice, he is Kubera and he is Varuna, and he is great Indra. (8) Even a boy king should not be treated with disrespect, with the thought, "He is just a human being"; for this is a great deity standing there in the form of a man.71 Like the temples themselves, the king was the representation of the macrocosm in this world, and could even be associated with Mount Meru itself, as both were the immovable centers of the moving world around them: "The king, his palace, his central shrine, and his capital city therefore belong to the same cycle of equivalences as does Meru. In a sense, the ruler is Meru. "72 To make this comprehensible, his central linga received not only the name of Siva, to whom it was dedicated, but also the name of the king. The king was a deity in human form, and the central and highest point of the kingdom, from whence his power descended to the furthest reaches of the realm.73 This notion is already expressed in the name of the Sri R?jendresvara of the East Mebon. With the Sri R?jendrabhadresvara of Pre Rup, 68 One ofthe earliest references to this name at Wat Phu is K. 367 from the sixth century CE, which contains a eulogy to Jayavarman I and mentions the name Li?gaparvata, probably in reference to Wat Phu and its sanctuary.

Even though this name was not necessarily intended to indicate King R?jen dravarman's political sovereignty over the area of Wat Phu - though that was probably the case - it makes explicit the spiritual prowess ofthe king, who could incorporate that name into the name of one of his central li?gas. As we have discussed in the previous section, the central li?gas of both temples were surrounded by four icons representing the deities ofthe trim?rti and Parvat?, and only two of these can be placed with certainty: the East Mebon Brahma in the southeast corner prasat, and one ofthe two Pre Rup Siva images also in the southeast. It seems most plausible that the East Mebon Siva and Parvat?, the divine couple, were positioned in paired towers, i.e. the two northern ones. Since the northeast is diva's cos mic direction, and the prasat is guarded by male devas, Siva most likely stood in the northeast sanctu ary. Parvat? would thus have stood in the northwest, a fitting placement in a tower with female devat?s. The image of Visnu must therefore have been placed in the southwest prasat in his cosmic direction, the west. As has been stated above, the female guardian devat?s do not preclude this location, and the pairing of Visnu with Brahma in the two southern towers would mirror their being mentioned together in the inscription, as are Siva and Parvat?. At Pre Rup, the placement of ?svara R?jendravarmesvara together with the dikp?lak?s in the south east tower is given in the inscription. The location ofthe Parvat? seems to be fairly straightforward to determine: the southwestern^/. Strangely, this sanctuary depicts two devat?s that deviate from the standard depiction of human females. The northern devat?on the east side has four faces and four arms, and depicts Brahma's sakt? Brahm?. The southern devat? on the west side has a boar's head and repre sents Varah?, the consort of Visnu in his boar incarnation (figs. 21a, b). Considering that the prasat is guarded by the consorts of two ofthe gods ofthe trim?rti, it seems likely that the tower contained the consort ofthe third deity, to whom the temple was actually dedicated. This would also pair the Par vat? with an icon of Siva - and, regarding the dedication ofthe images, Queen Jayadev? with her son King Harsavarman. While it seems likely that Siva was placed in the northeast sanctuary, northeast being his cosmic direction, this may not have been the case considering the guardians ofthe sanctu ary. Unlike the other male guardians carved at Pre Rup, the eastern devas have four arms, and not the usual pointed cap but what looks like a miter. Because the stucco has weathered away, only the out lines are still visible. The attributes are vaguely discernible: the northern guardian appears to hold a round object in his upper right hand and both seem to hold staffs in their lower left hands (fig. 22). Additionally, inscription K. 527 from King Jayavarman VI (r. 1080?1107?) is carved on the south door jamb. The six lines date from 1002 saka (1080 CE ) and are the only evidence for this monarch spend ing time at Angkor: I Homage to the Destructor of Madhu [Visnu] who, [having seen] arrogant Daitya lying perma nently in the eight areas of space, carries the eight arms which he acquired by his heroism, for the simultaneous destruction of... 246</page><page sequence="35">II King Sri Jayavarmadeva, who ascended to power [in the year demarcated] by the moon (i), the sky (o), the sky (o), and the arms (2), making die fear, in the ocean and the mountains, fish and the enemies, having destroyed ... thanks to his irresistible and unequalled rigor, like that of M?d hava, protected, starting from the ocean, the entire earth, filled with good brahmins. Ill Previously, circulated... of Kali..., but during his extremely peaceful reign, like Manu... the worst robbers emerged... exposing during the night... for saying what is good, he gave life to this and then to that.74 A later reference to King Jayavarman VI can be found in King Jayavarman VII's Ta Prohm inscrip tion, mentioning Jayavarman VI's coronation at Angkor: XIII Having obtained the supreme royalty at the Holy City of Yasodharapura the King Jayavarmadeva, whose ancestors resided at Mah?dharapura, vanquisher of the mass of his enemies, erected in all directions up to the sea pillars of glory.75 Thus, Jayavarman VI appears to have come from Mah?dharapura, in all likelihood located in the north, possibly the Mun valley, and been crowned at the old capital at Angkor. How much time he spent there is not certain, as most of his inscriptions are found in present-day Thailand. It seems, though, that during his stay at Yasodharapura he erected an image of a transcendental Visnu at Pre Rup, pos sibly in the northeast prasat. Should this be the case, and also considering the unusual devas of the sanc tuary, this tower may also have been originally dedicated to Visnu. This would place the second image of Siva in the northwest tower. At both temples, the five central deities are surrounded by eight li?gas representing the astam?rti. At the East Mebon it is nearly impossible to identify which prasat housed which representation, as the only features of the small brick towers that differ are their lintel motifs. These are, starting from the east-south tower in a clockwise direction: zgajasimha, a lion disgorging garlands, Indra on Air?vata between two inward-facing lions exuding garlands, Indra on a three-headed Air?vata, Indra on Air? vata between two outward-facing lions disgorging garlands, Indra on Air?vata, a lion swallowing an elephant, and a lion exuding garlands. 74 George C d?s, "Nouvelles pr?cisions sur les dates d'av?nement de quelques rois des dynasties Angkoriennes. ?tudes Cambodgiennes, no. 38," Bulletin de l'?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient 43 (1943-1946): 15. 75 George C d?s, "La St?le de Ta-Prohm," Bulletin de l'Ecole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient 6 (1906): 51-72.

Among the remains inside the towers, there are clear indications o? li?ga bases in the two towers south ofthe east and west staircases. Altogether there are eight towers next to the four staircases; consequently the li?gas may have been placed in the towers next to the staircases, and the images in the corner towers. This would to a certain degree par allel the arrangement in the East Mebon, where the li?gas were erected in towers next to the axes ? at Pre Rup delineated by the staircases. An alternative placement of images and li?gas at Pre Rup is pos sible in view ofthe lintels ofthe small towers. Only the lintels ofthe four eastern towers show Indra on Air?vata, whereas the remaining eight lintels depict k?la. This arrangement of motifs might indi cate that the li?gas were placed in the towers with k?las, and the images were placed in the towers with Indra on Air?vata. This assumption, however, is precluded by the presence of a li?ga base in one ofthe eastern towers. Indeed, the li?gas seem to have been placed in the towers next to the staircases, and the images in the four corner towers. At both temples, other contemporary images were found: carvings ofthe nine deities and seven rsis, and at the East Mebon an image of Ganesa. At both temples these carved sandstone blocks were discovered in the so-called south "library," a type of building found at numerous Angkorean temples. Generally, these buildings have a rectangular shape, a tiered superstructure with holes in the sides, and no ceiling. At the East Mebon the superstructures ofthe five laterite buildings no longer exist, but evidence for them can be found in the form of brick remains on top ofthe walls. These buildings are usually called libraries because of an inscription at Prasat Khna. This inscription, dating from the reign either of King R?jendravarman or of his son King Jayavarman V, was found on exactly this type of building, which was in the southeast corner ofthe enceinte. Though badly damaged, the inscrip tion in stanza XXII states that "[b]y this Hiranyaruci... was built thispustak?sramah."1^ G. C d?s interpreted the term pustak?sramah as "library" and concluded that the building on which the inscrip tion was found indeed served as the library of Prasat Khna. That libraries may have existed is indicated from what we know about the Funan period. The History ofthe Tsin from the third century CE states that in "Funan" "[t]here are books, and depots of archives and other things."77 From this evidence of "books" and "archives" in early centuries it can safely be assumed that during the tenth century books and other written material existed and had to be stored. Although one or more ofthe five buildings at the East Mebon may have served as libraries, other uses are conceivable, for instance to house the ritual fire. Fire was an important ingredient of all ritu als, and was used to entertain and cleanse the divinity. The first epigraphic evidence for these "houses with fire" dates from the reign of King S?ryavarman I, and such houses seem to have been most pop ular under King Jayavarman VII, who built 121 of them throughout the kingdom. Architecturally, these later buildings differ from the ninth- and tenth-century ones, having a long hall preceding a tower beneath which the fire was kept. Nevertheless, buildings like the ones at the East Mebon and Pre Rup are found at most temples, and the inscriptions mention two rites associated with fire: laksa y6 George C d?s, "Des ?dicules Appel?s 'Biblioth?ques.' ?tudes Cambodgiennes, no. 6," Bulletin de l'?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient u (1911): 405-406. 77 Cited in Pelliot, "Le Fou-Nan," 254. 248</page><page sequence="37">homa, "one hundred thousand oblations," and kotihoma, "ten million oblations. "78 The former is men tioned in stanza CCXXXVI at Pre Rup: CCXXXVI Although it had been burnt one hundred thousand times by the hotar in the fire of the [sacrifice] laksahoma celebrated by the king, the germ of all things produced a great fruit as if it had been sowed in water.79 Thus, the sacred fire had to be kept within the temple, in a building specifically dedicated to it. Typ ically, the shape of the "libraries" with their many openings in the superstructure would have been suitable to keep the sacred fire burning, whilst ensuring ventilation to let fresh air in and smoke and heat out. The southeast corner of the inner enclosure would have been an appropriate location for a building housing the sacred fire as this is close to the central sanctum and in the direction of Agni, the god of fire. Considering that the carving of the nine devas and seven rsis was found inside the southern build ings at the East Mebon and Pre Rup, these buildings may have housed not only the fire, but the carved blocks as well. The association of these two elements is known from Indian texts, such as various Pur?nas,80 and they may have been housed together in one building at Angkorean temples. The second of these two buildings, or in the case of the East Mebon possibly even more, may indeed have served as a library, or housed subsidiary images ? as indicated by the later depiction of the nine devas at the East Mebon and by fragments of images found at both temples. One indication that the buildings may in fact have had sacred connotations are the carved lintels over their doors. Apart from the rectangular buildings, these can only be found on prasats and gopuras, and seem to denote sanctity: prasats house images of deities and gopuras are thresholds linking the various enclosures. Due to the lack of more complete sculptures contemporaneous with the temples, it is impossible to determine which images these buildings might have contained. At this stage it can only be stated that the build ings seem to have had sacred connotations, with one of them housing a stone with the nine devas and seven rsis ? and potentially the sacred fire as well - and one or more of the others possibly being libraries. 78 Bhattacharya, Religions brahmaniques, 148. 79 C d?s, Inscriptions du Cambodge, 1:99-135. 80 Bhattacharya, Religions brahmaniques, 148, n. 7. 249</page><page sequence="38">4 THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PLACEMENT OF IMAGES The location of the central icons represents two aspects of the temples: manifestation and process. The temples as manifestation represent the Supreme Deity at the center of the cosmos - the macrocosm of the gods, and the microcosm of the kingdom. The Supreme Deity, in these cases ?iva, is placed in the central sanctuary of the temples, which make the god, the divine, discernible in the world of humans. This is explicitly stated with regard to the East Mebon in stanza XV of the inscription at Kuk Sla Ket : "Of the Yasodharatat?ka, filled with the water of his good deeds, he made a mirror, making it possi ble to see the dharma that one had not yet seen,"81 and again in stanza CCLXIX of the Pre Rup inscrip tion: "In the tank of Yasodhara established by Sri Yasovarman, this active king showed visually the dharma which was invisible." As process, the temples embody two progressions: the outflow of the Primary Energy and, in the reverse direction, the physical movement of the devotee towards the central icon. The outflow of the Divine Essence from the center to the periphery of the temple, and further into the kingdom, is epit omized in the sculpture. At the center and highest point of each temple stands the linga, the avyakta or niskala (amorphic) representation of the Absolute Siva. Around this, in the corner prasats, icons of Siva were erected, along with his consort Parvat?, Visnu, and Brahma, all invoked at the beginning of the inscriptions. Their anthropomorphic form, vyakta or sakala, is the perceivable and tangible rep resentation of the Primary Energy.82 The Divine Essence continues into the eight small prasats con taining the astam?rti, the eight elements that comprise the universe. Thus, the various images repre sent the outflow of power from the center, the Absolute, to the surrounding Universe, constituted by the eight elements. With increasing distance from the center this power becomes ever more tangible, until, at the threshold of the outer enclosure, it reaches the world of humans and manifests itself in the physical, everyday world of the kingdom. In direct opposition to this energy flow is the physical approach of the devotee toward the sanc tum. Entering the temple through the outer gopuras, the worshipper leaves behind the everyday world and transcends the profane. On moving into the inner enclosure the devotee traverses the final bound ary to this world, and enters the realm of the divine.83 Within the inner enclosure, the worshipper passes the manifest forms of ?iva in their pradaksin? of the temple, paying homage to the icons in the sub sidiary shrines: the small brick prasats and the libraries or fire houses, and finally the four corner tow ers. Moving ever closer to the central icon, the devotee finally approaches the transcendental Absolute in the sanctum sanctorum at the center of the compound, to make direct contact with the divine. One final aspect needs examining here: the temporality of the sites, as evidenced by later sculp tures. Little can be said about the images installed in the eleventh century due to the lack of accom panying inscriptions. Given that Jayavarman VI possibly erected an image of Visnu at Pre Rup, the depiction of the nine devas might be his donation as well. Whether the eleventh-century icons dis 8i C d?s, Inscriptions du Cambodge, 5:121-122. 82 V.

But since the two temples were clearly founded in relation to each other, it seems possible that this relationship was honored in later times as well. The most significant later additions at Pre Rup are the Visnu and Laksm?, both life size and possibly intended for the cen tral towers. The Visnu was found near the northeast prasat, where it may have been set up originally. Should this be the case, and if Jayavarman VI had placed an image of Visnu here as well, this would mean that there was a succession of three images of this deity in the northeast sanctuary: the first one founded by King R?jendravarman, succeeded by one in the eleventh century, and finally by one in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. The question arising now is, what happened to the original images ? Two scenarios seem possible. First, the new images may have been placed next to the old ones, and thus not only would the continuity be visible to everyone, but so would respect for the earlier sov ereign. Second, the original images may have been removed from theprasats and the new ones put up in their place. Again, if the identification ofthe head ofthe tenth-century Visnu is correct, it would be an indication that the original images were kept in the temples, although possibly at a different location. The later images established at both temples indicate a continuity of sacredness ofthe sites. This significance is apparent at Pre Rup in particular. The earliest post-Angkorean evidence is K. 264, con sisting of sixteen lines in Khmer carved on the door jambs ofthe southeast sanctuary. It dates from 1606 saka (1684 CE) and mentions an assembly and the dedication of a golden Buddha image84 - showing that by the late seventeenth century Pre Rup had been transformed into a Buddhist sanctu ary. At a later, unspecified date, south ofthe northeast prasat a stupa was erected for a monk of Wat Bo in Siem Reap,85 which was subsequently demolished by the French.86 Moreover, the 1950 restora tion reports ofthe Conservation d'Angkor state that a 40- to 50-centimeter-high Buddha statue had disappeared from the southwest shrine. This image had been venerated as a neak t?, an ancestor spirit.87 Looking at the prasats even today, each of them contains at least one Buddha image, which is wor shipped more or less regularly. The central sanctuary in particular still draws worshippers on a daily basis, as evidenced by the incense, candles, and other implements left behind. This continued spiri tual significance is visible at the East Mebon as well, which, like Pre Rup, is still very much part of the spiritual landscape ofthe nearby villages. 84 Etienne Aymonier, Le Cambodge.

The physical evi dence at both temples suggests that images were intentionally placed to exemplify the outflow of divine energy from amorphic li?gas inside the central sanctuaries, to anthropomorphic images in the corner prasats, and on through the additional eight li?gas representing the manifest forms of Siva in the surrounding smaller brick sanctuaries. Entering the temples, walking around them, and moving up to the central sanctum, the devotees embarked on a geographical journey from the profane world to the top of the axis mundi. It was at the same time a spiritual journey ? from the manifest, profane universe to the transcendental Absolute at the center of the compounds, where the worshipper would have been in direct contact with the divine. The outflow of spiritual power is directly paralleled by the outflow of the king's political power, as symbolized by the dedication of the icons to the king and his immediate relatives. The temples of King R?jendravarman are particularly interesting in this respect, as they housed two li?gas bearing a name combining the king's name with Siva - a clear indication of the king's spiritual cum political prowess. The foundation inscriptions at both temples mention the central icons established, but not other contemporary images set in subsidiary shrines, such as the nine devas. However, these images are an integral part of the functioning of the sites. Their placement inside the same building as the sacred fire, essential to all rituals, suggests their importance within the ceremonial life of the sites. In addi tion, later images seem to have been erected at both temples at the same time, evidence of the strong connection they were perceived to have even during later periods. As this study has shown, a meaningful interpretation of the temples and their use over time can only be achieved by considering the icons established there. Not only do they convey the deeper rit ual aspects of the temples, but they also allow an appreciation of the temporality and re-appropriation of the sites by devotees. The later sculptures and epigraphic evidence in particular clearly show a con tinuity of sacredness, especially at Pre Rup, not only into the reign of Jayavarman VII, but even beyond the Angkorean era. 252</page></plain_text>
