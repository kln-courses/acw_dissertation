<plain_text><page sequence="1">Forum History, Nostalgia, and American Furniture MichaelJ. Ettema With this issue, Winterthur Portfolio introduces a new department called Forum. It is intended as an outlet for opinion on matters relating to the study of American material culture. Because there are many different ap- proaches to the study of material culture, there are also deep and sometimes divisive controversies that too seldom appear in print. While the advantages of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies are frequently lauded, there is a tendency to ignore or gloss over (at least publicly) the fundamental differences that divide us. Yet most of us hold strong opinions about this or that aspect of the study of material culture or, indeed, the past in general. The editors believe that it is more constructive to debate these matters openly than to pretend that they do not exist. We invite thoughtful contributions; we also invite rea- soned responses. The editors reserve the right to select for publication contributions that in their view will be of broad interest to readers of this journal. The imperative for today's museums is outreach, or so we are told by the professional literature. In a wave of didactic responsibility, museums of art and history attempt to shed the popular image of dusty reliquary for people nostalgically bound to the past or the sometimes formidable reality of museum as clubhouse for the wealthy and over- educated. A new emphasis on interpretation and professionalization brings trained educators, cura- tors, and exhibit designers together in the search for ways to make the historical message more at- tractive and available to a broad public. Bold new programs demand popular involvement, and in- novative exhibit techniques arrest the attention of a growing audience. Progress in museums is pro- gress in educational methodology. Cutting through the professional hyperbole and aggressive adjectives, the progress seems merely to be a triumph of form over content. The method may have undergone startling revision, but the message often remains unanalyzed and un- criticized. In the rush to teach history, museum staffs have seldom paused to consider what history is, especially in its relationship to artifacts. Most curators and museum educators unconsciously perpetuate the traditions of the collectors and the antiquarians, many of whom established their in- stitutions, by assuming that knowledge of old things constitutes knowledge of history. There- fore, education in museums tends to be factual, descriptive, and particularistic. Artifacts are some- times displayed and embellished to represent his- torical narrative, but they still communicate only the facts and not the dynamics of history. Hand in hand with the interest in communicating specific information about objects is a reluctance to ask broader questions of historical or humanistic meaning. In their interpretation of historic objects, museums tend to convey nostalgia rather than history; not so much because their picture of the past is skewed or inaccurate, but because museum professionals seldom identify what it is we might learn from both history and objects. Nowhere is the unreflective nature of museum scholarship more apparent than in the published work of decorative arts curators and educators. Behind the gloss of expensive picture books with arty layouts lie dusty compendiums of undigested facts directed inward, to an internalistic study of objects, rather than outward, to historical learning. What I am suggesting here is not that traditional museum activities are inherently bad or wrong, but that the typical research and writing on American decorative arts and its largest subset, the history of American furniture, are ahistorical. Furniture books by museum professionals reveal implicit concerns and purposes that are quite distinct from Michael J.

More than most fields of study, American furniture history operates on a set of shared values and assumptions rather than stated goals and theoretical constructs. The great major- ity of furniture histories are not products of dis- tinct schools of thought so much as illustrative of patterns of socialized behavior. An understanding of furniture historiography demands at least an acquaintance with this social phenomenon. The study of furniture history is comprised of two behavioral patterns or impulses-aesthetic and historical. The former is a desire to understand and confront an object as an aesthetic entity and experience. Commonly known as "art apprecia- tion," this activity requires the placement of an ar- tifact on a scale of aesthetic desirability by em- ploying socially defined value systems. The pri- mary elements for judging elite art, such as is commonly collected by art museums, are age, pecuniary value of materials, degree of manipula- tion of accepted design principles, and originality of design. The operative words in the system are generally relative terms like beauty, quality, andfine- ness. The aesthetic impulse, then, results in a sub- jective judgment of value. In contrast, the historical impulse has an osten- sibly objective goal: the accumulation of facts. Quantity is a positive value here, and most of these facts must correlate with the object and help iden- tify it. Date, place of origin, maker, provenance, form, style, material, and various owners are the most desirable bits of information (as shown by any museum registrar's cards). The manufacture and the use of artifacts are the subjects of extensive research that concentrates on tools and shops, shop practices, sales techniques, quantity of output, identity of consumers, function of object, tech- nique of use, and environment of use. The histori- cal impulse is thus a desire to know the physical and quantifiable circumstances of an artifact's his- tory. Although diverse, the compilation of facts is not random, as the impulse selects information that can be used to place objects within historical categories or sequences, thereby further identify- ing them. The primary categories include maker, or school, which attempts to link makers by train- ing or philosophy; regional type, which links de- tails of form, decoration, or construction in order to chart geographic variations in design; form, or style, which establishes the object's position in aesthetic progressions, or sequences; and craft tradition, which places objects in technological sequences. These categories and various sub- categories organize the factual inventory by rank- ing data and providing concrete points for com- parison with other objects. In spite of the apparent differences of judg- ment and fact in the products of the two impulses, they exist side by side in most furniture histories. Indeed, they exist simultaneously and symbioti- cally. Although aesthetic judgments may be ir- relevant when acting on the historical impulse, an a priori aesthetic selection defines the appropriate subject matter for historical consideration. For in- stance, at the turn of the century, furniture histo- rians deemed goods of the Victorian era as aes- thetically unworthy and ignored them. Similarly, many contemporary museum scholars ignore in- expensive or traditionally styled furniture of the twentieth century in favor of high art or avant- garde pieces. Within acceptable categories, most furniture historians concentrate on the master- pieces and select those objects most compatible with their own particular aesthetic system. Value systems change over time, and thus do the individ- ual objects and categories of goods subject to the historical impulse. Just as visual selection limits the exercise of the historical mode, historical facts contribute to the definition of aesthetic systems. Age, an essential element of most systems, is the most basic of all historical facts. A walk through an art museum demonstrates that the older and, therefore, rarer an object, the more worthy it is of aesthetic consid- eration regardless of any other qualities it may pos- sess or lack. Historical associations, such as a link to a famous craftsman or owner, also elevate the aesthetic importance of an object. As such factual information provides criteria for visual judgments, the relationship of the aesthetic and historical im- pulses comes full circle. Together they constitute a pattern of behavior implicit in most decorative arts literature. Together they form the essence of the antiquarian tradition. Since antiquarian tradition relies on socialized activity that has an implicit and shared purpose, furniture histories tend to be historiographically homogenous. Much of the progress in the field over the last century has consisted of enlarging the subject area through the discovery of new groups of artifacts (which often turns out to be proclaim- ing previously ignored objects now worthy of study), discovering new facts about favored objects, or discovering new sources of factual information. Wendy Cooper's In Praise of America illustrates this progress as it summarizes research in the decora-</page><page sequence="3">Forum 137 tive arts since the trend-setting Girl Scouts Loan Exhibition of 1929.1 Although museum re- searchers have unearthed volumes of new in- formation and corrected many factual errors, they have failed to question fundamental assumptions of purpose. Thus, the antiquarian impulses define and perpetuate the behavior of most contempo- rary students of American furniture. Con- ceptually, furniture history has changed little over the past 50 to loo years: it seeks appreciation of artifacts through unsynthesized historical data. Given the implicit unity of purpose, furniture histories fall into topical rather than ideological groups. The basic issues in the field are the categories of information established by the his- torical impulse, and intersections of those categories provide organizational frameworks for books and articles. Charles Parsons's The Dunlaps and Their Furniture exemplifies the studies of a single school of cabinetmaking; it attempts to identify the products of various family members through the visual characteristics of the furniture and the apprenticeship lineage of the craftsmen. One of the best geographically oriented studies is Dean Failey's Long Island Is My Nation in which formal, decorative, and constructional features help identify the major ethnic influences on Long Island prior to 1830. Patricia Kane's 3oo Years of American Seating Furniture is a prototypical study of individual furniture forms; its narrative of chair- making traditions is followed by an extensive pho- tographic catalogue. Similarly, The Gothic Revival Style in America by Katherine Howe and David Warren employs a brief historical narrative and catalogue of artifacts to chart the course of a decorative style. An emphasis on craft and craft tradition is the focus of Charles Hummel's With Hammer in Hand, which describes the tools, organi- zation, and business practices of a single wood- working shop. To these historiographic categories we can add two other frequently used methods of organization: chronological surveys such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Nineteenth Century America, and catalogues of institutional collections as represented by Richard Randall's American Fur- niture.2 As is apparent from the list, furniture histories lack distinct ideological identities, so differences in viewpoint among the authors tend to be dif- ferences over the relative importance assigned to aesthetic judgments or historical descriptions. John Kirk, author of American Chairs, is one of the few writers to explicitly stress aesthetic values. Kirk not only judges the chairs for his readers but actually uses his subject matter to teach the elements of his own aesthetic system.3 The typical author working in the antiquarian tradition, however, employs the aesthetic impulse to justify the subject and to eval- uate the individual artifacts. The implicit visual judgment is overshadowed by an apparent empha- sis on the methods and goals of the historical im- pulse. In fact, the only identifiable trend in anti- quarian historiography in this century has been the conscious development of the historical impulse into an activity that may be labeled scientific anti- quarianism. Through methodological rigor, its practitioners attempt to maximize the accuracy of historical identification by logical inferences based on physical and documentary evidence. This method begins with positively identified objects and breaks physical evidence into accepted histori- cal categories. For example, it is observed, most five-legged Chippendale card tables with known histories were made in New York. Then, by ex- amining previously unidentified objects, it is possi- ble to infer that an unlabeled five-legged card table was probably made in New York. Seldom can such inferences be conclusive, but with careful observa- tion and a large data base such categorization can become highly plausible. To maximize reliable data, then, it is necessary to minimize im- pressionistic evidence in favor of concrete and quantifiable data. To aid the acquisition of useful data, scientific antiquarians have supplemented ac- cepted observations of stylistic attributes with de- tailed studies of construction techniques and with documentary evidence from sources like house- hold inventories and craftsmen's accounts. New methods of observation include X-ray, infrared, 1 Wendy A. Cooper, In Praise of America: American Decorative Arts, i65o-i83o (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1980). 2 [Charles S.

In sum, the scientific mode gives pre- cedence to historical identification while reducing the role of aesthetic judgment. Elements of scientific antiquarianism have existed in American furniture histories since Irv- ing Lyon established the primary historical categories in Colonial Furniture of New England. The major impetus, however, came with the establish- ment of museum-affiliated decorative arts pro- grams. Charles Montgomery, whose work at Win- terthur Museum and Yale University culminated in American Furniture and American Art, was one of the leading spokesmen and practitioners. Montgomery's best-known student, Benno For- man, demonstrated through his teaching and writing how systematic antiquarianism can yield vast amounts of information for historical narra- tive. In turn, Forman student Philip Zimmerman has produced a methodological study which repre- sents the state of the art of the scientific mode.4 Undeniably, antiquarian-oriented research has greatly increased the store of knowledge about our material past. If, as we assume, objects are histori- cal documents, traditional furniture histories pro- vide an invaluable service by identifying docu- ments and making them available for use. In par- ticular, the scientific mode with its rationalized system of identification is a remarkably efficient means of generating and organizing data. Sci- entific antiquarianism, however, is an apt metaphor of the emphasis of form over content that dominates in the museum profession. Like museum outreach, it has methodological vitality but an intellectually uncertain purpose. It is a "centripetal" approach to artifact study which "starts with an object or an artisan and spirals in- ward, comprising smaller, tighter, and more specific questions."5 The aesthetic and historical impulses can only map out patterns in artifacts; they make no attempt to explain how these patterns form, and they lack the theoretical content with which to explain the dynamics of historical process. The unwillingness to move from fact to concept in furniture history appears in the frequent use of the word context to identify an object's situation in a historical category rather than the cultural values implicit in an artifact's manufacture or use. In- deed, the antiquarian tradition's interest in broader questions of social and cultural history is usually aimed at enhancing specific objects rather than using objects to enhance our understanding of history. In its reluctance to generate historical concepts, the antiquarian tradition is limited to fundamen- tally presentist concerns. The judgments of the aesthetic impulse are the products of contempo- rary values. They tell us much more about modern preferences and prejudices than about patterns of life, thought, and attitude in the past. Although more subtle, pursuing the historical impulse has much the same result. Rather than synthesizing facts into an understanding of historical process, the impulse categorizes historical details in ways most congenial to contemporary uses of the past. The motives for antiquarian-oriented behavior are too diverse and complex for consideration here, but it is essential to note that the intended product is personal enjoyment, or appreciation, of objects. Aesthetic and historical impulses work together to recreate the past in an image designed for emo- tional gratification. The effect is to project our- selves on the past rather than to learn from it. Thus, antiquarianism is an ahistorical activity. Of course, the recreation of the past for the fulfillment of private, emotional needs is not re- stricted to museum authors, but it is a traditional activity of collectors and connoisseurs. More broadly speaking, it is the substance of nostalgia.6 The widespread popularity of nostalgic experience gives the authors of most furniture histories com- munality of interest with antiques hobbyists.

Although a code of museum ethics supposedly now separates the curator from the tainted world of the antiques market, even the most ethical curator is simply an institutionalized collector and dealer who retains most of the values, methods, and goals of his private counterpart. Curators, dealers, and private collectors form a network based on the exchange of goods and in- formation. Both dealers and collectors sell objects to each other and to museums for profit. (Museums also acquire artifacts through donations that are motivated by personal gratification, public recognition, or large tax deductions.) Since museums infrequently return objects to the mar- ketplace, their role is to provide the other partici- pants with antiquarian-oriented information. This data fosters appreciation of artifacts and legitimizes collecting behavior. By providing a pro- fessional service that has an aura of academic pur- ity and the rhetoric of the pursuit of knowledge, the antiquarian tradition in museums lends the appearance of order and reason to an activity that lacks much of a rational base. Furthermore, museum scholarship has a substantial commercial function in the network; by enhancing enjoyment it also enhances price. The frequent complaint of curators that their writing and exhibitions often make artifacts financially inaccessible to the museum is quite accurate. It is not because dealers and collectors are parasites on the museum profes- sion, but because they are a museum's natural and most logical audience. Museums supply a market- able slice of the past that aids the enjoyment of private treasures or provides vicarious antiquarian experiences for people unable or unwilling to buy the stuff of their historical fantasies. The potential here for misunderstanding is undoubtedly very great. Certainly it would be un- productive to suggest that antiquarian-oriented activities as I have defined them are useless or ridiculous. Museum scholarship is highly effectual within its own sociocultural system. It is highly im- portant in the respect that it fulfills a common need. The crucial point is that antiquarian pur- poses exist quite apart from the goals of historical inquiry. The relative positions of typical furniture scholarship and historical writing can be seen more clearly by examining three recently published books on American furniture. All three were writ- ten or coauthored by museum curators and con- sultants, and two were designed to accompany major traveling exhibitions. The first book exem- plifies the productive potential of the antiquarian exercise and points to some common ground be- tween object study and history. The second suggests the economic potential of museum writ- ing. The third and most revealing book demon- strates the devastating results that stem from con- fusing history and antiquarianism. In a look at a new topic, David Hanks's Innovative Furniture in America makes a tidy and successful contribution to antiquarian-oriented literature.7 Hanks states that his purpose is to cele- brate American inventive genius in furniture design and aesthetics, and he and his essayists carry out their narrative task clearly, concisely, and with- out pretense. One of the most useful and best written por- tions of the book is Rodris Roth's chapter, "Nineteenth Century American Patent Furniture," which describes the structure of the United States patent system and the major categories of patented furniture. Beginning with a brief historical sketch of the patent office, Roth listed the essential criteria for an acceptable patent application and described how patent information is published or otherwise made available to the public. She then surveyed furniture patents and mapped nineteenth- and twentieth-century trends in types of mechanisms or designs patented and the forms of furniture on which they appear. The solidly re- searched and well written essay provides a useful starting point for anyone seeking more informa- tion on American patent furniture. The main body of the book expands on Roth's descriptions of patent trends, dividing the furni- ture into five categories. Chapters on the use of bent wooden laminates and nonwood materials explain how these innovations generated new aesthetic possibilities. The chapters on comfort, portability, and multiple functions concentrate on patented structures and mechanisms, celebrating how cleverness of function is combined with aesthetic acceptability. Hanks and his coauthor, E. Page Talbott, briefly described each category of innovation in the chapter introductions. Extensive captions for the large-scale, high-quality photo- graphs sketch the history of the company or indi- vidual who manufactured the object and attempt to place the product in the proper technological, formal, or stylistic sequences. Thus, the main thrust of Innovative Furniture is the extension of aesthetic appreciation to previously uncelebrated artifacts, supplying factual data and establishing five new antiquarian categories. 7 David A. Hanks, Innovative Furniture in Americafrom 8oo to the Present (New York: Horizon Press, 1981).</page><page sequence="6">140 Winterthur Portfolio It is indicative of the traditional orientation of the book that while the theme "innovative furni- ture" sounds conceptually based, the term is im- possible to precisely define. Innovative furniture and patent furniture categories overlap, but not everything considered innovative was patented. Moreover, some so-called innovations-for exam- ple, folding chairs-were not new in the nineteenth century. Ultimately, the topic lacks definition; it is only understood intuitively. To help identify and organize this uncertain group of artifacts, Hanks turned to a highly conceptual his- torical work, Siegfried Giedion's Mechanization Takes Command.8 What Hanks uses are merely Giedion's two descriptive categories: "transitory," or unenduring, style-bound furniture, and "con- stituent" furniture that expresses a more lasting and modern impulse. Within constituent goods are Giedion's categories of comfort, portability, and multiple function to which Hanks added technique and materials. What Hanks failed to utilize from Mechanization Takes Command is the essential con- cept that makes the book a major contribution to the social history of technology: the idea that in- novative furniture was a manifestation of the adoption of mechanization as a pervasive cultural value. Hanks mistook the evidence for the idea and built a typically antiquarian-oriented book on de- tails rather than on concepts. Although a synthetic cultural view of innovative furniture is beyond the stated scope of Hanks's celebratory narrative, happily enough the other contributors did suggest links with larger historical issues. In the introduction to her chapter, Roth indicated that the distinction of a patent held spe- cial appeal to nineteenth-century Americans as both symbol and substance of progress. Patent furniture is, thus, a potential subject for inquiry into the relationship between technological change and the idea of progress. In the book's introduc- tion, Russell Lynes proposed using the categories "passive furniture," on which we "impose our will to derive the greatest degree of comfort," and "dis- ciplinary furniture," which forces us into a par- ticular posture or mode of behavior." Although this dichotomy may not hold up to extensive analysis, at least it brings to mind two critical ideas: furniture both embodies cultural values and de- mands of its users a degree of participation in that cultural system. In Lynes's undeveloped comments lies the potential for a successful fusion of fact and concept. This is the point where furniture history becomes useful to students of cultural history and reaches the limits of the antiquarian tradition. If a potential link between objects and history can suggest directions for research, it can also be turned into a sham that promotes the antiquarian importance of artifacts. In his introduction to The Furniture ofJohn Henry Belter and the Rococo Revival, Marvin Schwartz asserts that Belter's work is a "phenomenon of great significance" to the furni- ture historian. "Belter worked at the moment when the Industrial Revolution was affecting furniture production, and in the course of his career Belter changed from being a cabinetmaker to a furniture manufacturer, a fact that raises important ques- tions."10 Unfortunately, neither Schwartz nor the other contributors ever stated what those impor- tant questions might be. In fact, Belter's re- lationship to the rest of nineteenth-century wood- working technology is seldom mentioned thereaf- ter. Such questions become superfluous once we recognize that the authors' primary, but unstated, goal is to increase the current popularity of Belter's furniture by making unsupported and unsupport- able statements about his key position in history. The book is loosely structured on typical antiquarian-oriented categories: How can Belter's products be identified? Where did he learn his trade? What are the stylistic attributes of the rococo revival, and do they coincide with Belter's designs? This compendium of factual information is quickly overshadowed by the functions of the antiques network. The book and the accompanying exhibit, for which Schwartz was guest curator, were based on the extensive private collection of Gloria and Richard Manney, for whom Schwartz also served as consultant. In his enthusiasm for Belter furni- ture, Schwartz wrote a text that often glosses over facts as well as concepts on the way to a hyperbolic interpretation. The first chapter, for example, exists solely to demonstrate Belter's importance and notoriety from his time to our own. This mis- sion encounters rather grave difficulties, because the documents mention Belter less often than some of his currently popular contemporaries. Before presenting the scattered fragments of evidence that do exist, Schwartz asserted that "documenting furniture-making activity in 1850 New York is as ' Siegfried Giedion, Mechanization Takes Command: A Con- tribution to Anonymous History (New York: Oxford University Press, 1948). 9 Hanks, Innovative Furniture, p. 13. 10 Marvin D.

Dutton, 1981), p. 1.</page><page sequence="7">Forum 141 difficult as documenting that activity in ancient Rome."11 Ultimately, his essay relies on the interest in Belter among twentieth-century collectors and dealers to support his thesis. The argument, there- fore, becomes circular. The second chapter, "Distinguishing Belter as a Generic Term from Belter as a Cabinetmaker," begins, "The documented furniture by John Henry Belter includes the most splendid examples of the Rococo Revival style." Instead of describing concrete features of design and construction, Schwartz identified the furniture with effusive emotion and superlative rhetoric. This is hardly the scientific approach, but again, the emphasis here is less on discovering new information than on reinforcing treasured hopes and beliefs. Twice we are asked to believe that the "evidence at hand proves [Belter] was the greatest furniture designer ... of the nineteenth century."'12 Schwartz's delu- sion of proving a value judgment transcends even the antiquarian tradition and passes into the realm of media hype. In contrast to Schwartz's overworked aesthetic sensibilities is the triumph of scientific anti- quarianism in Edward Stanek and Douglas True's "Technical Observations." In this meticulous chapter, the authors report the conclusions of their extensive observations of laminated rococo revival furniture. Beginning with labeled and docu- mented objects, they have carefully amassed data on the physical characteristics common to Belter furniture in an attempt to objectively identify the products of the Belter shop. Had the other chapters been given the clear focus of "technical observations" the book might have proved a useful antiquarian-oriented exer- cise. Schwartz, however, does not follow his established categories. For example, facts of Bel- ter's shop and comparisons of his products to those of his contemporaries lie scattered throughout sev- eral chapters, and specific information is often dif- ficult to locate. Likewise, the last chapter, "A Gal- lery of Furniture from the Collection of Gloria and Richard Manney," lacks organization. The photo- graphs, which might have been used as a visual catalogue of the forms, patterns, and techniques laboriously attributed to Belter by Stanek and True, illustrate the wealth of a private collection more than the typology of a cabinetmaker's prod- uct. In the end, salesmanship triumphs in this book, and the goals of the antiquarian tradition fall to the wayside in Schwartz's frenetic effort to con- vince the antiques world that Belter was best. A few of the more ambitious furniture histories actually attempt to deliver on promises of a his- torical study of artifacts. In American Furniture: 1620 to the Present, we have a pictorial survey which proposes to serve as both a compilation of facts and an "analysis of furniture as an index of social and technological evolution."'3 While the authors do attempt to place objects in context by lacing each chapter with historical narrative, fact and concept experience a most uneasy union. Jonathan Fair- banks and Elizabeth Bates simply applied a veneer of social history over a structure of antiquarianism. At heart, this book is not a consideration of Ameri- can material culture, but an enthusiastic arbiter of taste for furniture hobbyists and collectors. Fairbanks and Bates provided few logical con- nections between their brief historical passages and the 1,400 illustrations that form the bulk of the book. They neither reasoned from the evidence of artifacts to broader conclusions nor deduced how objects exemplify known historical trends; they simply juxtaposed various bits of information and photographs, leaving the reader with the implica- tion, but not the understanding, of a historical pro- cess. In the first chapter, for example, the authors recited such truisms as "wood was the essential material out of which the New World was built"; the early colonists structured their built environ- ment on the pattern of their Old World homes; "many Pilgrims did not survive"; and mortise- and-tenon joinery was basic to much seventeenth- century furniture making.14 We are also treated to illustrations of woodworking tools and an exploded drawing of a joined chest. We never do learn, however, why it may be important to know these facts or how they might relate to each other. We are left to wonder what it all means, or indeed if it means anything at all. This approach produces a disjointed text with strained and tenuous con- nections to the artifacts. The bad fit of history and artifact is not simply a stylistic failing; it is symptomatic of a profound confusion of purpose which permeates American Furniture. The authors felt compelled to attempt objective historical analysis and to indulge in aesthetic value judgments. In the introduction they professed the belief that there are no clear bound- aries betweeen the so-called fine and decorative " Schwartz, Stanek, and True,John Henry Belter, p. 2. 12 Schwartz, Stanek, and True,John Henry Belter, pp. 5, 29; see also p. 33. 1'"Jonathan L.

Yet Fairbanks and Bates were less interested in breaking down intellectual barriers between the two fields than in rearranging the barriers for their own convenience. By adopting qualitative as- sessments of craftsmanship as one of their goals, they did not eliminate an artistic hierarchy but merely expanded it to include objects they happen to have selected. This intellectual self-contradiction necessarily precludes effective historical analysis. The aesthetic impulse, then, is omnipresent in American Furniture. In both the text and the cap- tions the authors frequently judged individual ob- jects and entire stylistic categories for those readers who are ostensibly unable to consult their own aesthetic sensibilities. Fairbanks and Bates asserted as a point in case that a particular product of Thomas Affleck "is the most elegant side chair made in eighteenth-century Philadelphia" and that the Chippendale period was "one of the greatest ages of craftsmanship." At times the authors at- tempted to correct the aesthetic mistakes of the past by noting how a particular object might have been improved visually. The degree to which the authors invest their aesthetic and emotional selves in their explanations of objects appears in a pen- chant for anthropomorphism and other flights of fancy. Describing a Philadelphia Chippendale sec- retary, they held that "while the actual structure of this desk and bookcase is substantial, and the wooden members are thick-bodied, the visual ef- fect of the whole seems almost to be dancing to eighteenth-century music. The impression is one of an evanescent experience so light and delicate that it seems almost to transcend the material world."15 The notion that a massive item of case furniture could seem immaterial is less extraor- dinary than the supposition that such a fabulation could possibly lead to any historical understanding. These frequent lapses reveal only the personal de- sign preferences of Fairbanks and Bates. Of course, the authors share their particular aesthetic system with a large portion of the an- tiques network. Consequently, their book is a sur- vey of the elite collectors' market preferences rather than of American furniture history. The book's organization follows traditional antiquarian categories of mainstream period styles and various vernacular traditions, featuring so-called master- pieces and other artifacts of current interest to well-heeled collectors. As a result, huge segments of American furniture production are totally ab- sent and other categories are grossly mis- represented. Typical to antiquarian orientation, the chapter on the twentieth century includes only avant-garde and idiosyncratic handmade goods, although the overwhelming majority of furniture used by people at all economic levels since the turn of the century has been factory made in historical styles. A chapter entitled "Away from the Main- stream" is heavily weighted with objects from out- side the Anglo-American tradition, implying that most lower-class people were not Anglos. In short, Fairbanks and Bates largely ignored the furniture used by most Americans and favored the aestheti- cally acceptable remnants of the aristocracy and other subcultures. One of the most disturbing aspects of the lim- ited scope of American Furniture is the cultural con- descension that results from inherent biases in the aesthetic impulse. In this case, the authors' eastern, urban, Anglo, elite orientation becomes the stan- dard against which all objects are judged. Although the furniture used by rural dwellers or social inferiors may be described as "charming," it is, by definition, substandard, which reduces its makers and users to childish or simple-minded historical curiosities. In their patronizing descrip- tions of non-high-style objects, the authors fell squarely into the antiquarian trap of judging rather than explaining unfamiliar cultures. It is over this tangled mass of bias and emotion that Fairbanks and Bates built a facade of historical analysis. Much of the facade, however, is con- structed of an intellectual tease, or double-talk, that promises ideas but delivers nothing. We are told, "[Pilgrim furniture] is suggestive of complex and rich influences of trade and culture," and a particular chest "is an important document of Middle Colonies' taste." That material goods are manifestations of culture is the basic tenet of mate- rial culture studies, the purpose of which is to ex- plain why and how. Simply repeating the axiom constitutes neither analysis nor insight. Other pas- sages initially appear to contain explanations of cultural phenomena but on closer inspection are opaque or meaningless rhetoric. Thus we read that the rococo revival "seems to have represented a search for the origins of creative power."'" Quite effectively at times, the authors have created the illusion rather than the substance of history. When Fairbanks and Bates do offer less elusive conclusions, the result is still often disappointing. Demonstrating a lack of both intellectual initiative 15 Fairbanks and Bates, American Furniture, pp. 153, 141, 189. 16 Fairbanks and Bates, American Furniture, pp. 3, 48, 365-</page><page sequence="9">Forum 143 and acquaintance with current interpretation, the authors seldom looked beyond the obvious attri- butes and categories of objects in order to generate new ideas or recast old ones. Instead, they resorted to facile theories that have been battered about and largely discarded during this century. Among the hackneyed ideas of antiquarians found in the book is the myth of technological decadence. Ignoring work published as early as 1974, the authors have maintained that the use of woodworking ma- chinery became widespread about 1840 and re- sulted in the production of shoddy furniture dis- guised with cheap ornament.17 The myth of the frontier likewise makes an extended appearance, proffering its ancient brand of environmental de- terminism. We also find the classic antiquarian myth of folk or country naivete which asserts that in the netherworld of the nonelites, "changing urban fashions were misperceived by both craftsmen and clients."18 There are indeed naive misperceptions here, although not on the part of the furniture makers. American Furniture is further punctuated by some of the authors' own interpretations. We read, for instance, that American neoclassical furniture was simpler than its European counterpart because "Americans were in a hurry."19 Presumably the people of the new republic could not wait around to have their furniture decorated. Such bizarre as- sertions not only are divorced from reason but also betray a minimal comprehension of basic craft practices, business habits, and economic laws. This is historical fantasy turned nightmare. In spite of the conceptual disasters in American Furniture we might hope that the authors could de- liver on their antiquarian promise of "detailed factual matter."20 Stripping away the pseudo- history, however, leaves only unreliable anti- quarianism. With its strong aesthetic emphasis, the book cannot build the precise, predictive categories of the scientific mode. For example, occasional ar- tifact comparisons in the early chapters purport to show regional characteristics, but fail to specify the concrete differences between the objects and lamely state only that each is aesthetically exemplary of its region. The book is also plagued with surprising factual errors. A chair from Frank Lloyd Wright's 1936 S. C. Johnson building is identified as a 1904 design for the Larkin Com- pany. A table said to illustrate J. H. Belter's lami- nation technology is the only labeled Belter table that is not laminated. In sum, both the concepts and the connoisseurship in American Furniture must be approached with caution. Yet, the failings of these few books discussed above are of secondary concern. More important is that each of these works represents, with varying degrees of conscience, the reluctance of many museum authors to move beyond factual compila- tions or personal appraisals of artifacts. Furniture history and, indeed, the study of all objects of human production is a virtually untapped source of historical learning. Given the nature of the an- tiques network, the number of museum authors who have adopted a historical approach to objects is very small, but precedent does exist. Often using an antiquarian data base and especially the sci- entific mode, these students of material culture move out from objects to ask broader questions about social process in history. The centrifugal ap- proach focuses attention on historical theories and concepts rather than on factual categories and thereby links artifacts with the activities, the values, and the attitudes that make up culture. The study of material culture grew out of art history, and thus many of its practitioners have concentrated on the visual qualities of artifacts. The pioneering work in the visual approach to material culture is Alan Gowans's Images of Ameri- can Living which attempts to identify the aesthetic systems behind traditional period styles and link those systems to contemporary political and social ideologies. Robert St. George's structuralist studies, which retrace a seventeenth-century mental template through examination of Mas- sachusetts furniture and woodwork, exemplifies more recent work in this area.21 Within the past several years a second field of interest in material culture has begun to emerge. It looks beyond aesthetic concerns and the process of creation and views object use as cultural expres- sion.

It represents, however, a crucial early attempt to synthe- size artifacts and the stream of cultural history.

In "Meaning in Artifacts," Kenneth Ames has examined how Victorian hall furniture communi- cated social messages to its users and how these reveal contemporary social values to us. Combining both visual and functional considerations, The Rock- ing Chair Book by Ellen and Bert Denker explores the human aspects of a common object by viewing its variations in form and use as responses to chang- ing attitudes about comfort, propriety, and the American past.22 Like antiquarianism the subject matter of these cultural studies is objects, however, their purpose is to explore how objects become in- vested with meaning and what that meaning re- veals about patterns of life in the past. Ultimately, these authors are not concerned with objects, but with people. Although antiquarian and material culture studies often cover the same subjects, their essen- tial differences are intellectual goals and priorities. Certainly few material culture historians claim a monopoly on historical truth, but what they may lay claim to is a mode of inquiry into human ac- tions. Ideally, any history, including material his- tory, examines the dynamics of past societies in the effort to understand the dynamics of our own. In contrast, the antiquarian approach yields a consid- erably more static image of the past with the ulti- mate purpose of providing a personally satisfying nostalgic experience. In short, historical inquiry revises and deepens historical understanding by consistently challenging accepted notions of the past, while nostalgia consoles and reassures by ap- pearing to confirm ideas and feelings we already hold. Contemporary American society values both approaches to the material past; both approaches have great personal and cultural utility and, there- fore, validity. As museums continue to act on their educational imperative, however, they might do well to examine their own intellectual goals and priorities. They must consider the content of their message; to pursue nostalgia is not enough. Museums are a resource of great potential for both public education and academic study. To tap this potential museum professionals must constantly consider two questions: Can historical learning be communicated through objects? And, conversely, can historical learning be gained through the study of objects? This introduction of academic study to museums need not be a threat, for history and nostalgia are not mutually exclusive. If museum professionals are serious about educational objec- tives, historical inquiry is not merely compatible with their intentions, it is necessary to them. 22 George Talbot, At Home: Domestic Life in the Post-Centennial Era, 1876-1920 (Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1976); Kenneth L.
