<plain_text><page sequence="1">When Theaters Were Bear-Gardens; or, What's at Stake in the Comedy of Humors JASON SCOTT-WARREN ON 12 FEBRUARY 1667, Thomas Killigrew, manager of the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, told Samuel Pepys how drama had been faring since its Restoration revival. He complained that audiences at his playhouse had halved since the great fire of the previous year, and he expressed high hopes of a promising new actress. Then he boasted that-thanks to his own efforts-the theater was much improved since the kings return: [T]he stage is now by his pains a thousand times better and more glorious then ever heretofore. Now, wax-candles, and many of them; then, not above 3 lb. of tal- low. Now, all things civil, no rudeness anywhere; then, as in a bear-garden. Then, two or three fiddlers; now, nine or ten of the best. Then, nothing but rushes upon the ground and everything else mean; and now, all otherwise. Then, the Queen sel- dom and the King never would come; now, not the King only for state, but all civil people do think they may come as well as any.1 Killigrew's distinction between his newly glorious theater and the slovenly spaces that had passed for playhouses before the closure of 1642 is heavily overdrawn. But his account is worth having for its perception of change, its celebration of a new age in which theatrical spectacle is civilized, cultured, and at last fully visible. It is also noteworthy for the simile that Killigrew employs to express the incivility of the pre- Civil War theater: "Now, all things civil, no rudeness anywhere; then, as in a bear- garden": Ambiguously poised between bear-garden's familiar figurative meaning, "a place of strife and tumult," and its literal referent,"a place originally set aside for the baiting of bears, and used for the exhibition of other rough sports," that simile is liable to collapse into literalness in other ways, since of course the older theaters were not just like bear-gardens: in some cases, they actually were bear-gardens.2 This article opens that fact to fresh examination. Among the many people who offered helpful comments on earlier versions of this article, Mary Laven, John Kerrigan, and the anonymous readers for Shakespeare Quarterly deserve special thanks. 1 The Diary of Samuel Pepys, ed.

As such, it has attracted skeptical com- ment, thanks to which we can no longer claim that the first permanent public play- houses in London were actually modeled on the bear-pits.3 Still, the areas of overlap remain too many and too striking to ignore. When the stands in the Bear Garden on the South Bank collapsed under the weight of an unexpectedly large crowd in 1583, the venue was rebuilt on the model of the new, three-story play- houses. The men who ran professional theater in late-Elizabethan and Jacobean London also made their money from commercial blood sports; in 1604 Edward Alleyn was "sworne the Princes man and Maister of the Beare Garden,' and in 1613 Philip Henslowe oversaw the rebuilding of the Hope as a "place or Plaiehouse fitt &amp; convenient in all thinges, bothe for players to playe in, and for the game of Beares and Bulls to be bayted in the same'" with a removable stage and a permanent sta- ble.4 Comparably, in 1617, the entrepreneur Christopher Beeston employed Inigo Jones to convert the cockpit in Drury Lane into a theater; by that date Henry VIII's cockpit in Whitehall Palace had been used for plays for at least a decade.5 Blood sports and drama also shared constituencies. The godly frequently damned the two entertainments in one breath, despising bearbaiting because it took place on the Sabbath and playing because it was popular enough to fill the house every other day of the week.6 Meanwhile, courtiers displayed as marked a penchant for animal-baiting as they had for theater. An aristocratic pastime in the Middle Ages, bearbaiting became a commercial activity toward the end of the fifteenth cen- tury, when bearwards wearing the liveries of their lordly patrons took their masters' animals on tour to the country houses of the kingdom-rather in the manner of playing companies. In the early modern period the sports of baiting and playing occupied homologous social positions, caught between the paying London crowd and the nobles and monarchs who continued to patronize them-and who inter- mittently brought them to court for command performances. 3 Oscar Brownstein, "Why Didn't Burbage Lease the Beargarden?

Alexander, editors of Records of Early English Drama: Somerset (2 vols. [Toronto: U of Toronto P, 1996]):"If the number of references in the Records is any indicator, bull- and bearbait- ing must have been the most popular form of entertainment in the county" (2:594).

C3V. 64</page><page sequence="3">WHEN THEATERS WERE BEAR-GARDENS So there is plenty of evidence to suggest that theater and animal-baiting were (as one literary critic has put it)"culturally isomorphic events:"7 But any attempt to con- sider the intertwining of the two forms presents a challenge, since the critical battle lines are so clearly drawn from the start. On the one side, there are the purists for whom the theater that produced Shakespeare must have stood head and shoulders above the world of flying fur and feathers. On the other, there are those who happily glorify the violence of an age whose culture was of a piece with its barbarism.8 In the argument that follows, I attempt to steer between these extremes, arguing that a reexamination of the links between theater and blood sports reveals much about the status of the commercial theater at a key point in its development. The two forms of entertainment overlapped spatially and socially, but in the early seven- teenth century they also came to share a representational mode, with fascinating and disturbing consequences. Early modern drama is shot through with allusions to blood sports, but this arti- cle focuses on two plays that display self-awareness about the relationship between theater and baiting: Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and Jonson's Epiccene, or the Silent Woman. The former has already received detailed critical consideration in this light, but the latter, although it has recently come back into critical fashion, has been read mainly for its figurations of gender and its satiric account of the rapid pace of social change in London.9 Twelfth Night contains several references to animal-baiting.10 Sir Andrew Aguecheek, introduced by Sir Toby Belch as a man who "speaks three or four lan- guages word for word without book,' turns out not to know what "pourquoi" means and wishes that he "had bestow'd that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting" (1.3.26-27, 92-93).11 Fabian nurses a grudge against Olivia's steward Malvolio because"he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a 7 Stephen Dickey,"Shakespeare's Mastiff Comedy,' Shakespeare Quarterly 42 (1991): 255-75, esp. 255. 8 Lytton Strachey nicely encapsulates this (ultimately Burckhardtian) perspective when he asks: "Who can reconstruct those iron-nerved beings [Elizabethans] who passed with rapture from some divine madrigal sung to a lute by a bewitching boy in a tavern to the spectacle of mauled dogs tear- ing a bear to pieces?" (Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History [London: Chatto and Windus, 1928], 9). For the accusation that the glorification of violence and irrationality lives on in new-historicist liter- ary criticism, see David Norbrook, "Life and Death of Renaissance Man," Raritan 8 (1989): 89-110. 9 See, for example, Janette Dillon, Theatre, Court and City, 1595-1610: Drama and Social Space in London (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2000), 124-36; W, David Kay,"Epiccene, Lady Compton, and the Gendering of Jonsonian Satire on Extravagance', Ben Jonson Journal 6 (1999): 1-33; and Marjorie Swann,"Refashioning Society in Ben Jonson's Epicane," SEL 38 (1998): 297-315. 10 The following paragraphs draw heavily on Dickey's article and its precursor, Ralph Berry's "Twelfth Night: The Experience of the Audience," Shakespeare Survey 34 (1981): 111-19. 11 Quotations from Shakespeare in this article follow The Riverside Shakespeare, ed. G. Blakemore Evans, 2d ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1997). 65</page><page sequence="4">SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY bear-baiting here" (2.5.7-8). More poetically, Olivia, having employed"a shameful cunning" to reveal her love for Cesario (3.1.116), asks Orsino's servant how he inter- prets the deceit: What might you think? Have you not set mine honor at the stake, And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? (11. 117-20) Here the language of bearbaiting expands into a larger field of references to hunt- ing, as we catch an echo of Orsino's Actaeon-like metamorphosis at the first sight of Olivia: "That instant was I turn'd into a hart, / And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, / E'er since pursue me" (1.1.20-22). But this is a play that does more than just mention bears and hounds in passing; in the gulling of Malvolio, it has been argued, Twelfth Night actually stages a bear- baiting. When Fabian complains about the steward's spoilsport tactics, Sir Toby vows revenge:"To anger him we'll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?" (2.5.9-11). Thereafter, with the support of Sir Toby, Fabian, and Sir Andrew, Malvolio is taunted by Maria, whose feigned letter encour- ages him to indulge fantasies above his station, and by Feste in the guise of Sir Topas the curate, who attempts (unsuccessfully) to push the incarcerated Malvolio over the edge into madness. Finally, Malvolio promises his revenge and exposes the bear- garden dramaturgy of the plot against him in the line that is his parting shot:"I'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you" (5.1.378). And, as if one blood sport weren't enough for a play, Sir Toby lays on a different kind of match as a sideshow when he sets up a duel between Sir Andrew and Viola/Cesario. Neither wants to duel, and each is informed that the other is implacable and highly dangerous. Before the encounter, Fabian tells Sir Toby how Sir Andrew "pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels" (3.4.294-95); and after Sebastian has stepped into his sister's shoes, Sir Andrew and Sir Toby end up with "bloody coxcomb[s]" (5.1.176), the phrase evoking the cockpit where birds, spurred like knights, fought to the death. Any director of Twelfth Night who elects, as Bill Alexander did in the 1987-88 RSC staging of the play, to chain Malvolio (Anthony Sher) to a stake during the dark-house scene is likely to be chided by the critical establishment.12 But the con- nection is powerfully supported by the evidence of one early "reading" of Twelfth Night, that of Ben Jonson, insofar as it is represented in his play Epiccene, first per- formed in 1609 at the Whitefriars Theatre by the Children of the Queen's Revels. 12 See Roger Warren and Stanley Wells, eds., Twelfth Night, or What You Will (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), 59. 66</page><page sequence="5">WHEN THEATERS WERE BEAR-GARDENS Since the case for a close relationship between the two plays has not, to my knowl- edge, been argued elsewhere, I shall discuss the later play more fully here. Like Twelfth Night, Epicoene alludes explicitly to the baiting of animals. But where Shakespeare portrays aristocrats, Jonson gives us in the character of Tom Otter a lowly London bearward. As one of the play's witty young men, Truewit, tells his friend Clerimont, Otter "has beene a great man at the beare-garden in his time" (2.6.61); in retirement he relives his former profession through his carousing cups, which he calls"his bull, beare, and horse" (1. 58).13 But Otter is himself a baited bear, being married to a city woman who sees him as the dead weight that retards her efforts to ascend into a courtly sphere. When we first see them together, Mistress Otter is berating her husband loudly for his bear-garden manners: You were best baite me with your bull, beare, and horse? Neuer a time, that the courtiers, or collegiates come to the house, but you make it a shrouetuesday!... By my integritie, I'll send you ouer to the banke-side, I'll commit you to the Master of the garden, if I heare but a syllable more. Must my house, or my roofe, be pol- luted with the sent of beares, and buls, when it is perfum'd for great ladies? ... Were you euer so much as look'd vpon by a lord, or a lady, before I married you: but on the Easter, or Whitson-holy-daies? and then out at the banquetting-house win- dore, when NED WHITING, or GEORGE STONE [famous bears], were at the stake? (3.1.4-7, 28-32, 46-50) Truewit, looking on as this ungoverned wife harangues her husband, proposes to treat her as a bearward would a mastiff, employing what is now a dead metaphor when he cries,"For gods sake, let's goe staue her offhim" (1. 51).14 He uses baiting ter- minology again in the next scene when predicting that the best sport to be had with Tom Otter will be "anon, when we get him loose" (3.2.12-13).15 That promise is made good later in the play, when the young wits bring Mistress Otter to overhear what Tom says about her when he is in his cups. Truewit staves her off for some time, 13 Quotations of all works by Jonson follow the texts in Ben Jonson, ed. C. H. Herford and Percy and Evelyn Simpson, 11 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1925-52), and will be cited in parentheses in the text. 14 According to Thomas Platter, the mastiffs "had to be pulled off by sheer force, and their muzzles forced open with long sticks to which a broad ironpiece was attached at the top" (Thomas Platters Travels in England 1599, trans. Clare Williams [London:Jonathan Cape, 1937], 169). See also OED, s.v. "stave," v., 6, which cites Epiccene as the earliest figurative use of stave as a verb. This idiom might also be implied in Twelfth Night, where Feste tells Olivia that Malvolio "holds Belzebub at the stave's end" (5.1.284-85). The high incidence of baiting language in this scene is noted by Gordon Campbell, the editor of Ben Jonson, The Alchemist and Other Plays (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), 469-70. 15 Cf. The Merry Wives of Windsor, where Abraham Slender asks Anne Page if she is"afraid if [she] see the bear loose" and boasts,"I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the chain" (1.1.292-96). 67</page><page sequence="6">SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY forcing her to listen to her husband's abuse; then, at last, he gives her leave to lash out with words and fists. Thoroughly beaten, Tom Otter retreats to the South Bank; Truewit assures Clerimont that they would never have been rid of the bearward "vnlesse wee had put his wife vpon him" (4.2.148-49)-in the sense that a dog is "put" or "set" upon a bear.16 That Epicene, like Twelfth Night, uses animal-baiting as a structuring device is clear from the way in which the Otters are introduced to us. The scene in which the shrew upbraids her husband in a torrent of words follows hard on the heels of sev- eral scenes centered on Morose, described in the dramatis personae as"a Gent[leman] that loues no noise,' who has found that prodigy of nature, a "silent Woman," to be his wife. Morose calls the use of her tongue"a womans chiefest pleasure" (2.5.41-42), and the contrast between the woman who uses her chiefest pleasure to bait her hus- band and the woman who remains eerily quiet is unmistakable. The action of the play, of course, will collapse the dichotomy between silent woman and shrew, since Epicoene finds her tongue as soon as she is married to Morose. Noise links the play's action to the bearpits; while Mistress Otter objects to the bestial smells that her hus- band brings into her house, the rest of the play emphasizes instead the decibel level of the sport and the capacity of its sound alone to bait Morose. The idea that bark might be worse than bite where this"stiffe peece of formalitie" (1.1.143-44) is concerned is first articulated when, in the play's first scene, Cleri- mont's boy describes how he has helped to engineer noisy afflictions for Morose: we that loue him, deuise to bring him in such as we may, now and then, for his exercise, to breath[e] him. Hee would grow resty else in his ease. His vertue would rust without action. I entreated a Beare-ward, one day, to come downe with the dogs of some foure parishes that way, and I thanke him, he did; &amp; cryed his games vnder master MOROSE'S windore: till he was sent crying away, with his head made a most bleeding spectacle to the multitude. (11. 169-77) The baiting is continued when Truewit "translates" Sir Amorous La Foole's dinner party to Morose's house, in order that the "bride-ale" may be celebrated there with as much noise as possible. Clerimont makes sure that Tom Otter is invited and that he brings his carousing cups along with him; the drinking contest that follows (com- plete with trumpet blasts like those sounded between bouts in the bear-gardens) is so loud that it has Morose shouting down from the top of his attic, "Villaines, mur- derers, sonnes of the earth, and traitors, what doe you there?" (4.2.70-71). Later, 16 Cf.John Stow and Edmund Howes, The Annales, or Generall Chronicle of England (London, 1615): "Prince Henry ... caused the great Lion to be put into the yard, and iiii. doggs at a course to be set vpon him"; "there entred in thre stout Beare-wards, and set a lustie dogge vppon the mouth of the Lyon" (sig. 4F4r). 68</page><page sequence="7">WHEN THEATERS WERE BEAR-GARDENS Morose confesses to Dauphine that, in order to be free of his new wife, he would do "supererogatorie penance, in a bellfry, at Westminster-hall, i' the cock-pit, at the fall of a stagge; the tower-wharfe (what place is there else?) London-bridge, Paris-garden, Belins-gate, when the noises are at their height and lowdest" (4.4.12-16). Since Paris Garden was the site of the South Bank bear-gardens, Morose's list of hateful places alludes to the sites of three noisy blood sports. From that point forward, the play's triumvirate of wits, Clerimont, Truewit, and Dauphine, turn the screw on Morose scene by scene, and the methods by which he is tormented align him with Shakespeare's Malvolio. Epicoene declares her husband mad, and a crowd of charac- ters (rising in number from five to eleven as the scene develops) offer their opinions of his case. Jonson provides two men in the place of Shakespeare's Feste/Sir Topas, as Otter and Cutbeard play (respectively) a divine and a lawyer, brought in to school Morose in the knotty intricacies of divorce law-with much caviling over the finer points."O, the varietie and changes of my torment!" (5,4.9), cries Morose toward the end of his ordeal, precisely capturing the nature of the drama he has been caught up in. Epiccene turns diverse forms of cruelty into entertainment. To complete its mirroring of Twelfth Night, Epiccene also contains an Aguecheek/Cesario strand in Truewit's plot to shame two knights, Jack Daw and Amorous La Foole.17 Each is assured that the other is out for his blood, and both are so terrified that they agree to endure a small punishment-a kicking or a tweak- ing of the nose-in order to forestall more serious damage to their persons. The punishments are then administered, before an audience of ladies, by the wits. These scenes represent acts of purest cruelty to animals. The spectacle of La Foole,"hood- wink'd in this skarfe" and made to "beare a blow, ouer the mouth, gules, and tweakes by the nose, sans nombre" (4.5.325-29) brings to mind the whipping of the blind bear, a regular part of bear-garden entertainments. Insofar as the plot of Epicoene borrows from the plot (or "sub-plot") of Twelfth Night, it corroborates the argument that the earlier play draws dramatic structures from the animal-baiting arenas that flourished alongside and within the theaters of early modern London. But if these plays are alike in their incorporation of baiting plots, they are nevertheless very different from one another. Where Shakespeare sets his action in the mythical Illyria, Epiccene is precisely located in relation to the emergent sphere of the "town," the fashionable West End which was growing up between Westminster and the cramped city of London-within-the-walls. While Twelfth Night invokes an established tradition of commedia dell'arte cross- wooing/cross-dressing comedy, Epiccene appears in hindsight to pioneer a new mode-one that the Restoration theater would perfect-in its delineation of the 17 For more on this parallel, see Anne Barton, Ben Jonson, dramatist (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984), 125. 69</page><page sequence="8">SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY aggressively competitive behavior of sharp-talking gentlemen. Why should two plays occupying such different social worlds meet in their acknowledgment of the kinship between theaters and bear-gardens? To answer that question, we need to understand the pleasure of blood sports. Why did people bait animals in early modern England? What exactly made the bear-gardens popular London spectacles, as important a part of the tourist itinerary as the royal palaces, St. Paul's Cathedral, and the lions in the Tower? At least two lit- erary critics have recently attempted to answer these questions. For Stephen Dickey the matches were part of a heterogeneous spectacle, "a carnival of cruelty" in a pre- dominantly festive, comic mode, which offered plentiful opportunities for gambling. Contemporary accounts harp on"the audience's unspeakable pleasure and'good con- tentment'"; Dickey comments that "again and again the audience was pleased by what it saw, cheered it on, and laughed at it."18 By contrast, Erica Fudge, in a study of the construction and deconstruction of the animal as"other" in early modern cul- ture, picks up on one report of a baiting match-written by the Italian merchant Alessandro Magno in 1562-which expresses reservations about the sport: They take into the ring-which is fenced around, so that one cannot get out unless the gate is opened-a cheap horse with all his harness and trappings, and a monkey in the saddle. Then they attack the horse with five or six of the youngest dogs. Then they change the dogs for more experienced ones. In this sport it is wonderful to see the horse galloping along, kicking up the ground and champing at the bit, with the monkey holding very tightly to the saddle, and crying out fre- quently when he is bitten by the dogs. After they have entertained the audience for a while with this sport, which often results in the death of the horse, they lead him out and bring in bears-sometimes one at a time and sometimes altogether. But this sport is not very pleasant to watch.19 On the basis of this account, Fudge argues that the fascination of cruelty to animals lay in its repeated blurring of the lines dividing humans from animals. While the monkey moves Magno to laughter, the less obviously anthropoid bears (who are, like the spectators, confined in the arena) serve to remind Magno of his weakness 18 Dickey, 256, 257, and 259. Dickey also notes that the outcome of bearbaitings was often incon- clusive, without clear-cut winners and losers, a fact that guides his reading of the problematic con- clusion of Twelfth Night. 19 Alessandro Magno, quoted here from Erica Fudge, Perceiving Animals: Humans and Beasts in Early Modern English Culture (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000), 11. The role of blood sports in the ideologi- cal construction of animality is considered by Rebecca Ann Bach in "Bearbaiting, Dominion, and Colonialism" in Race, Ethnicity, and Power in the Renaissance, Joyce Green MacDonald, ed. (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1997), 19-35; and by Bruce Boehrer in Shakespeare Among the Animals: Nature and Society in the Drama of Early Modern England (New York: Palgrave, 2002). Throughout my discussion, I use the word animal as shorthand for non-human animal. 70</page><page sequence="9">WHEN THEATERS WERE BEAR-GARDENS in the face of a violent and wild nature. More generally, some parts of the bear- garden entertainment offer viewers the illusion of their superiority to the beasts on display; other parts collapse "the binaries of baiting and being baited; watching and performing; human and animal"20 The documentary evidence suggests, however, that a large part of the pleasure of blood sports for the early modern viewer had to do with what it revealed about the animals. In first-hand accounts of animal-baitings, animals are regularly anthropo- morphized by way of their surprising qualities and characteristics. Here, for exam- ple, is part of a report from the secretary of Frederick, duke of Wiirttemberg, who visited London in 1592: His Highness was shown in London the English dogs, of which there were about 120, all kept in the same enclosure, but each in a separate kennel. In order to grat- ify his Highness, and at his desire, two bears and a bull were baited; at such times you can perceive the breed and mettle of the dogs, for although they receive seri- ous injuries from the bears, are caught by the horns of the bull, and tossed into the air so as frequently to fall down again upon the horns, they do not give in, so that one is obliged to pull them back by their tails, and force open their jaws. Four dogs at once were set on the bull; they, however, could not gain any advantage over him, for he so artfully contrived to ward off their attacks that they could not well get at him; on the contrary, the bull served them very scurvily by striking and butting at them.21 What stands out in this account is the spectator's detached admiration for the qual- ity and courage of the English dogs and the art and cunning of the bull. A similar report comes from the Swiss traveler Thomas Platter, visiting London seven years later in 1599. Platter commented on "the excellence and fine temper of [great English] mastiffs," which,"although they were much struck and mauled by the bear, ... did not give in"; the way the bear"kept the dogs at bay ... artfully with his paws"; and the"masterly fashion" in which the bull tossed the dogs.22 With these accounts we might compare Samuel Pepys's descriptions of the cockfights at which he was a somewhat unwilling spectator. On 21 December 1663, he saw an advertisement for a new pit in Shoe Lane and went to acquaint himself with "a sport I was never at in my life."23 After commenting on the "strange variety of people" in attendance- "from [a] Parliament-man ... to the poorest prentices, bakers, brewers, butchers, draymen, and what not"-Pepys turns to the spectacle: 20 Fudge, 19. 21 Chambers, 2:455. 22 Platter, 169. Another comparable description of a baiting is offered in Robert Laneham, A Letter: Whearin, part of the entertainment vntoo the Queenz Maiesty, at Killingwoorth Cast ... iz signified ... (London, 1575), sig. B5r-v. 23 Pepys, 4:427. 71</page><page sequence="10">SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY I soon had enough of it; and yet I would not but have seen it once, it being strange to observe the nature of those poor creatures, how they will fight till they drop down dead upon the table and strike after they are ready to give up the ghost-not offering to run away when they are weary or wounded past doing further. Whereas, where a Dunghill brood comes, he will, after a sharp stroke that pricks him, run off the stage, and then they wring off his neck without more ado. Whereas the other they pre- serve, though their eyes be both out, for breed only of a true cock of the game.24 During a second visit to a cockpit five years later, Pepys again noted"the mixed rab- ble of people" and found that there was "no great sport" to be had there, "but only to consider how these creatures without any provocation do fight and kill one anoth- er-and aim only at one another's heads, and by their good wills not leave till one of them be killed."25 Surprised at his fellow men, Pepys is also, against his better judgment, absorbed by the behavior of his fellow animals. These are not isolated incidents, and taken together they point to the fact that larger issues of identity were at stake in early-modern animal fights. As one author- ity has noted, "to a large extent the story of bearbaiting is the story of the English mastiff, a particularly large and potentially ferocious animal for which England was famous as early as Roman times."26 This fact helps us to see a little more clearly why Londoners would want to take foreign merchants and ambassadors to the bearpits; in effect, even before Britain came into being, the myth of the British bulldog was being played out in the arenas every Sunday. This is perhaps the place to mention the many testimonies from this period to the more specific group loyalties implicated in animal fights. At a 1620 bullbaiting in Chester, held as part of the farewell celebra- tion for an outgoing mayor,"it Chaunced a Contention fell out betwixt the Bowchers and bakers of this Cittye aboute there dogges then feightinge," which "fell to blowes," prompting the mayor to intervene to pacify the warring tradesmen.27 In Shropshire in 1597-98 the jailer, one Richard Hortoon, set up a cockpit at the back of his house and invited a large crowd to come in and gamble. Here the loyalties were regional rather than professional: "the matche was made betweene the Cockes of cheshire and lanckashir against the cockes of shropshire and wales thider cam lvndeneres withe their cockes whiche held with shropshiremen but in the ennd the cheshiremen and 24 Pepys, 4:427-28. 25 Pepys, 9:154. 26 Brownstein, 243. According to Mark S. R.Jenner,"Dogs were not just ubiquitous, they also car- ried an extraordinary variety of emphatically anthropocentric meanings ....

Viuat Rex.29 That final note of monarchic fervor was not inappropriate, for James, like his Tudor predecessors, thought blood sports a splendid diversion, and the accounts of his pastimes emphasize how much humans can invest in animal identities. Although better known for his devotion to the hunt, James also sponsored static baitings, some of them very unusual. During a guided tour of the Tower of London in the spring of 1604, James was told about the lions kept there. How did they come to EnglandP whereunto was answered that no mention is made in any record of Lions breeding here, neuerthelesse Abraham Ortelius, and other forraine writers do affirme that there are in Englande beasts of as great courage, as the Lion, namely the Mastiffe Dog.30 James then asked Edward Alleyn, Master of the Bear-Garden, to set"3. of the fellest dogs in the Garden" on"the lustiest Lion" in the Tower.31 The fight is described in all its gory detail in Edmund Howes's continuation of Stow's Annales, with particu- lar attention to Jamess attempts to interpret animal nature: The king now perceiuing the Lion greatly to exceede the Dog in strength, but nothing in noble heart and courage ... the King caused the Lyon to be driuen downe, thinking the lyon would haue parted [two dogs fighting each other], but ... contrary to the Kinges expectation, the lyon fled into an inward den.32 The writer adds to these his own observation that"The Lyon hath not any peculiar or proper kind of fight, as hath the Dog, Beare, or Bull, but onely a rauenous kind of surprising for prey"33 James staged similar displays in the Tower the next year, when he set two racks of mutton, two cocks, and a lamb in the arena with the lions, 28J.

(The lions on this last occasion again proved unexpectedly cow- ardly and kept retreating to their dens.) Diversity was evidently important to ani- mal-baiting; the "varietie and changes" of the torments on offer parallel those to which Epiccene's Morose is subjected. But records of these displays suggest that it was the"peculiar or proper" nature of the beasts-with particular attention to their courage-that was of paramount interest.34 And among those beasts the lion had an obvious ideological significance, made explicit by the young Prince Henry when he told Alleyn "to make much" of one valiant mastiff, "saying, he that had fought with the king of beastes, should neuer after fight with any inferiour creature."35 We know from elsewhere in Stow's chronicle that one of the lionesses in the Tower was called "Elizabeth"; the name was disclosed when, in 1604, untrue to her recently- deceased historical prototype, she whelped.36 Such examples suggest that the pleasure of animal-baiting did not arise merely from the challenge it posed to cultural demarcations of the human and the bestial. Rather, it followed from the way that the bearpits and cockpits enabled animals to become objects of knowledge, exposing their inner natures to outward view.37 For this reason, the anthropomorphism implicit in baiting did not necessarily lead to sympathy; rather, where comic detachment was lacking, a quasi-scientific objectivi- ty could come to dominate. The arena became a kind of psychological anatomy the- ater, revealing the courage, nobility, and artistry, the"peculiar or proper" character of the animals that were exposed to the public gaze. This is also the key to baiting's kinship with the public theater of Shakespeare and Jonson. At the end of the sixteenth century, dramatists discovered a new mode: the com- edy of humors. The Galenic medical theory of the four humors, bodily substances 34 Stow and Howes, sigs. 4C8V, 4F3V-4F4r. Apart from courage, the most evident preoccupations in these accounts are with the surprising rivalries and affiliations between animals; in James's 1609 baiting, the lamb gets on well with the lions (they have just eaten two racks of mutton), while in a baiting arranged by Prince Henry in 1610, two lions fail to come to the rescue of a third (sig. 4F4'r) On the premodern attribution of human characteristics to animals, see Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England, 1500-1800 (London: Allen Lane, 1983), 51-70. 35 Stow and Howes, sig. 4A4r. 36 Stow and Howes, sig. 4B2r. 37 That the language of inwardness long predates the advent of romanticism is demonstrated by Katharine Eisaman Maus in Inwardness and Theater in the English Renaissance (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1995) and by John Martin in "Inventing Sincerity, Refashioning Prudence: The Discovery of the Individual in Early Modern Europe," American Historical Review 102 (1997): 1309-42.

Jonson defines humor as "when some one peculiar quality / Doth so possesse a man, that it doth draw / All his affects, his spirits, and his powers, / In their confluctions, all to runne one way" (Every Man out, Pro. 105-8). The effect of such distortions of personality was usually comical, and we can sense the word humorous beginning to take on its primary modern meaning in the welter of titles and subtitles of plays that appeared in print from 1598 onward: The History of Henrie the Fovrth ... With the humorous conceits of Sir Iohn Falstaffe (1598); The Blinde begger of Alexandria, most pleasantly discoursing his variable humours in disguised shapes full of con- ceite and pleasure (1598); A pleasant Comedy entituled: An Humerous dayes Myrth (1599); The Pleasant Historie of the two angrie women of Abington. With the humorous mirthe of Dick Coomes and Nicholas Prouerbes, two Seruingmen (1599); The Comicall Satyre of Every Man ovt of his Hvmor (1600); The Shomakers Holiday. Or The Gentle Craft. With the humorous life of Simon Eyre, shoomaker, and Lord Maior of London (1600)-the list goes on.39 Humor rapidly became a marketable commodity. Who was behind the inno- vation? Although it is hard to establish priority in an area where dating is so uncer- tain, theater historians tend to credit the invention of humors comedy not to Jonson or Shakespeare but to Chapman, whose popular play An Humerous Days Myrth was first performed in May 1597. Thereafter, the two major companies with permanent bases in London, the Lord Admiral's and the Lord Chamberlain's Men, rivaled each other in the production of humors plays. Andrew Gurr has called this rivalry "pos- sibly the clearest single indicator of the power and intensity of the commercial incentive in company repertories through the whole period.40 Commercialism is indeed central to a proper understanding of this craze. The humors were not just a principle for the creation of character; they were also a way of marketing dramatic entertainment. That much is clear from the metatheatrical- ity of humors-plots, which frequently use internal dramatists to create-and inter- nal onlookers to frame-the action, thereby consciously selling the mirth to the audience. The celebrated box-tree scene of Twelfth Night (2.5) is paradigmatic in this 38 The most recent studies of humoral theory in early modern literature are Michael C. Schoen- feldt, Bodies and Selves in Early Modern England: Physiology and Inwardness in Spenser, Shakespeare, Herbert and Milton (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1999); and Gail Kern Paster, The Body Embarrassed: Drama and the Disciplines of Shame in Early Modern England (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1993). 39 The OED does not spell out the logic of the shift to the modern sense of humorous but dates its first appearance to the late-seventeenth century; see also s.v. "humour," n., 7a; and"humorous," a., 4. 40 Andrew Gurr, The Shakespearian Playing Companies (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), 241. For a survey of humor plays, see Robert S.

Malvolio is the victim of a plot requiring the involvement of an internal plotter-effectively a surrogate playwright-in the shape of Maria. There is also an onstage audience, made up of Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian, framing the action that will frame Malvolio. And that audience repeatedly expresses its pleasure in Maria's wares, saying such things beforehand as "If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boil'd to death with melancholy" (2.5.2-3) and afterward as "I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy" (11. 180-81). The hyperbole of these interjections does not vitiate their basic point: good comedy is priceless. But such comments are also, viewed cynically, the early modern precursor of canned laughter. That structure of the box-tree scene is repeated throughout humors comedy.41 A key scene in Jonson's Every Man out of his Humour (first performed in 1599) gives us, in place of Malvolio, the affected courtesan Saviolina; for Maria, the soldier/scholar Macilente; and for an audience, the courtiers Fastidius Briske and Puntarvolo. When Saviolina's true colors are revealed by Macilente's deceits, Puntarvolo informs us that his"splene is great with laughter" and declares that"there was neuer so wittie a iest broken, at the tilt of all the court-wits christen'd" (5.2.133; 5.3.10-11). Perhaps the most telling of such framing comments comes from Epicoene, a later play which falls squarely into the humors mould, with Morose as humorist par excellence.42 After his introduction to the ridiculous poetaster Sir John Daw, Clerimont asks: "Was there euer such a two yards of knighthood, measur'd out by Time, to be sold to laughter?" (2.4.151-52). Here, theatergoing is figured as a form of consumption. The tailor is not Time, however, but the playwright, who cuts out his human fabrics merely to keep the audience in the height of fashion. The point of framing humans, as of baiting animals, was to reveal their inner natures. So, in Twelfth Night, Maria's playlet is designed rapidly to disclose what Maria herself has already divined from her previous acquaintance with Malvolio: he is ... an affection'd ass, that cons state without book, and utters it by great swarths [i.e., swathes]; the best persuaded of himself, so cramm'd (as he thinks) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work. (2.3.147-53) The gulling of Malvolio turns him inside out, exposing his vice of self-love to the eyes of the world both within and without the play. And, as we watch Maria's 41 For a comparison of gulling scenes, see Ann Blake,"'Sportful Malice': Duping in the Comedies of Jonson and Shakespeare" in Jonson and Shakespeare, Ian Donaldson, ed. (Basingstoke, UK: Macmillan, 1983), 119-34. 42 Cf. Dryden's defense of Morose against those critics who thought him too singular in Ben Jonson: The Critical Heritage, D. H. Craig, ed.

Humors comedy offers a voyeuristic promise of disclosure. Surface pretension will be stripped away, and the audience will obtain privileged glimpses into private selves. We get to see the overweening narcissism of a Malvolio; the thinly veiled cowardice of a Daw, a La Foole, or an Aguecheek; the unflappable patience of a Candido (the linen-draper in Dekker's Honest Whore); the ungoverned impatience of a Hotspur. Like animal-baiting, the comedy of humors purveyed a form of knowledge. The point is made most clearly by Phantaste, one of the crew of courtly ladies in Cynthias Revels (Jonson's next play after Every Man out, first performed in 1600). Passing the time, and apropos of nothing, these women discuss what they would like to be. Moria would like to be the person who knows all the gossip; Philautia (self-love) would like to be herself (of course!), but with more power. Phantaste wants to be the one that all men fall for: ... and in that person I would prooue all manner of suters, of all humours, and of all complexions, and neuer haue any two of a sort: I would see how Loue (by the power of his object) could worke inwardly alike, in a cholericke man, and a sanguine; in a melancholique, and a phlegmatique; in a foole, and a wise man ... and how he could varie outward... And then, I to haue a booke made of all this, which I would call the booke of humours, and euery night reade a little piece, ere I slept, and laugh at it. (4.1.198-214) Offering a fantasy of knowledge as potent as any indulged by Marlowe's Faustus, Phantaste's "booke of humours" would record the results of a potentially endless series of experiments in the unity and diversity of human nature. Such experiments are the essence of the theater of humors, which is forever proving its characters. The way it dissects personality clearly aligns this comedy with the early modern anato- my theaters, a resemblance suggested when Sir Toby Belch correctly predicts that his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek will be slow to duel with Cesario: "I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open'd and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of th'anatomy" (3.2.59-63).43 But, through its revelation of interior humoral nature, this drama offers pleasures that are also alarmingly similar to those on offer in the bear-gardens, cockpits, and bullrings. 43 Cf. the assessment of Dekker's Candido:"He was a man made vp without a gall" (Honest Whore, Part 1, in The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker, ed. Fredson Bowers, 4 vols. [Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1953-61], 2:1-130, esp. 91 [5.1.60]).

Plays in this tradition are full of animals that have learned how to talk. Epicene's Sir Jack Daw, that"meere talking mole" (2.4.153), and Tom Otter,"an excellent animal" (2.6.52), are typical verbal fumblers. Chapman's An Humerous dayes Myrth is dominated by a char- acter called Lemot whose hobby, as his friend Colenet observes, is collecting human parrots. Here is the dialogue that frames the presentation of one such, Blanuel: COLENET Why Lemot I thinke thou sendst about of purpose for yong gallants to be acquainted withal, to make thy selfe merry in the maner of taking acquaintance. LEMOT By heauen I do Colenet, for there is no better sport then to obserue the complement, for thats their word, comple- ment, do you marke sir? COLENET Yea sir, but what humor hath this gallant [Blanuel] in his maner of taking acquaintance? LEMOT Marry thus sir, he will speake the very selfe same word, to a sillable after him of whome he takes acquaintance, as if I should say, I am marueilous glad of your acquaintance, He will reply, I am meruailous glad of your acquaintance, I haue heard much good of your rare parts &amp; fine cariage, I haue heard much good of your rare parts &amp; fine cariage, so long as the complements of a gentleman last, he is your complete ape. COLENET Why this is excellent.44 Later on, Lemot (wordy by nature as well as name) offers to amuse his friend Catalian by going round a table and predicting what musty proverb each person will resort to when replying to him: CATALIAN Thats excellent, lets see that yfaith. LEMOT Whatsoeuer I say to Monsieur Rowlee, he shall say, O sir, you may see an ill weed growes apace. CATALIAN Come, lets see. LEMOT Now Monsieur Rowlee, me thinks you are exceedingly growne since your comming to Paris. ROWLEE O sir, you may see an ill weed growes a pace. CATALIAN This is excellent, forward sir I pray.45 Lemot pulls off the same trick with four more diners, the last one a lord who replies with a hoary Latin sentence. Similar displays of comic predictability occur in Henry 44 George Chapman, A pleasant Comedy entituled: An Humerous dayes Myrth (London, 1599), sigs. A2V-A3r. 45 Chapman, sig. E3v 78</page><page sequence="17">WHEN THEATERS WERE BEAR-GARDENS Porter's Two angrie women of Abington, which features a character called Nicholas Proverbs, a "formall foole" who inevitably "speakes nought but prouerbs": "I had thought you had been my friend, but I see all is not golde that glisters, ther's fals- hood in fellowship, amicus certus in re certa cernitur, time and trueth tryes all, and tis an olde Prouerbe, &amp; not so old as true, Bought wit is the best."46 While the Admiral's Men were peddling this sort of"bought wit," their rivals in the Chamberlain's com- pany were staging Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, with its notorious episode in which Prince Hal,"to drive away the time till Falstaff come" (2.4.28-29), contrives to make Francis the drawer reply 'Anon, anon, sir" (1. 27) to offers of freedom and wealth beyond his wildest dreams (11. 34-97): "That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman!" (11. 98-99). In scenes like these, humors comedy beats the bounds between true humanity and a humanity that is merely apparent, annihilating liars, apes, and pretenders to eloquence and wit.47 Sir Andrew Aguecheek, who pockets Cesario's flowery language of compliment- "'Odors,"pregnant,' and'vouchsafed'; I'll get 'em all three all ready" (3.1.90-91)-is cast out, and Malvolio, who"cons state without book, and utters it by great swarths" (2.3.149-50), is unmasked. But Viola/Cesario, who is eloquent enough to deflect Olivia's attacks on her"compliment" (3.1.99), and who turns the idea of conning a speech"without book" to her rhetorical advantage against the countess (1.5.194-95), proves herself to be fully human through her heroic command of language. The proliferation of characters who are animals rather than humans can turn a play into a low form of entertainment, the equal of a freak-show, or a bearbaiting. The jests in humors comedies quickly pall or turn sour. Either they are not very funny in the first place, or they are sold at too high a price by the internal audiences who heap praise upon the"sport," or they turn nasty. In Henry IV, Part 1, Poins has no sooner informed Hal of the plot that will expose Falstaff's cowardice and men- dacity than the young prince launches into his menacing"I know you all" soliloquy (1.2.195-217), in which he promises to tolerate the"unyok'd humor" (1. 196) of his drinking companions only so long as it suits him.48 In Every Man out, the railing jester Carlo Buffone grows sick of watching Puntarvolo playing Lancelot to his wife's Guinevere and guesses that the knight must have been feeding his "Most 46 Henry Porter, The Pleasant Historie of the two angrie women of Abington (London, 1599), sigs.

It is a critical commonplace that the gulling of Malvolio in Twelfth Night is a joke that goes too far, and the dubious nature of the sport in Epicoene has turned it into something of a Jonsonian "problem comedy."49 The chal- lenge that the reign of the humors presented to writers is neatly captured by the onstage spectator Cordatus in Every Man out, when he asks whether anyone could take offense "at the opening of such an emptie trunke as" Fastidius Briske (2.6.159-60). How do you sustain an audiences interest, when the discovery of inward nature is also the discovery of emptiness?50 In asking why Twelfth Night and Epicoene should so explicitly link playing with baiting, the tedium of humors comedy is highly relevant. For a hearty dislike of ani- mal-baiting was not the sole prerogative of puritan preachers. It was also given memorable expression in a sonnet (written around 1595) by a young student at the Inns of Court, Sir John Davies: Publius student at the common law, Oft leaves his bookes, and for his recreation: To Paris Garden doth himselfe Withdrawe, Where he is ravisht with such delectation As downe amongst the dogges and beares he goes, 49 Barton, 120-35. After they have despatched Tom Otter, Clerimont declares himself glad to see the back of him, and Truewit comments appositely that "his humour is as tedious at last, as it was ridiculous at first" (4.2.149-50). 50 There may be a countervailing point to make here. A number of recent commentators have noted the personalization of literary culture in the later sixteenth century, in such phenomena as the growth of name-authorship and the increased willingness of writers and dramatists to direct satire at living individuals. Douglas Bruster refers to a"developing genre that we might call embodied writing ... a kind of text and a textual practice that, increasingly during the 1590s, put resonant identities and physical forms on the printed page" ("The Structural Transformation of Print in Late Elizabethan England" in Print, Manuscript, &amp; Performance: The Changing Relations of the Media in Early Modern England, Arthur F Marotti and Michael D. Bristol, eds. [Columbus: Ohio State UP, 2000], 49-89, esp. 50). Matthew Steggle talks of"personation" and links it with"a more ambitious, author- driven theatre, more prepared to represent realistic things and possibly even from time to time real people" (Wars of the Theatres: The Poetics of Personation in the Age ofjonson [Victoria, BC: U of Victoria P, 1998], 20). Although nobody has ever proved that Malvolio or Morose represented real individu- als, they are clearly embedded in the satirical culture these critics have described. So it is relevant to note that personalized satire was frequently represented as animal-baiting; images from blood sports recur throughout the Thomas Nashe/Gabriel Harvey quarrel, and are prominent in the Joseph Swetnam controversy, culminating in the anonymous play Swetnam the Woman-Hater Arraigned by Women (London, 1620), in which Swetnam is led off to be bound "In certaine places to a Post or Stake, / And bayted by all the honest women in the Parish" (sig. KlV). We might want to speculate that such person-baiting coincided with an increase in resources for the representation of identity- in other words, that satirical personation may have been linked to personation as the term is more commonly employed by theater historians, to describe the development from the 1590s onwards of a more realistic acting style. If so, the humors plays suggest that realism had its limits. 80</page><page sequence="19">WHEN THEATERS WERE BEAR-GARDENS Where whilst he skipping cries To head, To head, His Satten doublet and his velvet hose, Are all with spittle from above be-spread.

Arguably, this is the same division that separates the youth- ful John Donne (reputedly a great frequenter of plays) from the speaker of his sec- ond Satyre, probably written at the Inns of Court. The satirist laments the folly of that writer who gives ideot actors meanes (Starving himselfe) to live by his labor'd sceanes. As in some Organ, Puppits dance above And bellows pant below, which them do move.52 Donne's lines are a manifestation of what theater historians call"the antitheatrical prejudice." That prejudice has, in its late-sixteenth-century form, been linked to the widening gap between popular and elite culture; it would also have applied to blood sports as well as plays.53 In acknowledging a strong affinity between humors comedy and animal baiting, Jonson and Shakespeare demonstrate their disquiet about the medium in which they worked. Such disquiet is far more evident in Epiccene, which incorporates blood sports in their smelly, noisy, commercialized form, than in Twelfth Night, which presents them as the pastimes of aristocrats in a mythical Illyria. Nonetheless, just as London shows through Illyria in Twelfth Night's reference to the Elephant Inn in "the south suburbs" (3.3.39), so the commercial imperatives that shaped early mod- ern theater remain visible beneath the play's elite trappings. For a while, Shakespeare's comedy is propelled by the violent energies of the bear-garden; finally, it almost comes to grief on them. Epicoene, like other Jonsonian comedies, avows its desire to elevate theater above other forms of popular spectacle. But the 51 "In Publium" in The Poems of Sir John Davies, Robert Krueger, ed.

So if it is true that Epicoene pointed the way to the Restoration drama that so delighted Thomas Killigrew, played in theaters where "all things [were] civil, no rudeness anywhere', it is legitimate to doubt whether those theaters had really left behind the bear-gardens of the past. What is clear is that the overlap between the rival entertainments was not just a coincidence of space; it was also a matter of converging spatial practices. The interpretative activ- ities promoted by blood sports and drama in late-Elizabethan and Jacobean England were altogether too close for comfort.</page></plain_text>
