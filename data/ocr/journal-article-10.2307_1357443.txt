"Cypriote coroplasts ... were extremely prolific." Thus opens this ambitious and monumental work, a project that only Vassos Karageorghis could have undertaken. In it he succeeds in showing that the makers of terracotta fig- ures and models were imaginative and creative as well as prolific.</page><page sequence="2">1996 BOOK REVIEWS 79 The first four of a projected six volumes have now ap- peared.1 The completed series will cover the full range of indigenous styles until the advent of the Cypro-Classical period (ca. 475 B.C.), when local production becomes strongly imitative of Greek types. Karageorghis's intent is to provide a "catalogue raisonn6" rather than a complete corpus of objects (of which hundreds or even thousands can be found in a single deposit). Aided by the contacts and access assembled over a long and distinguished ca- reer, and with the generous support of the Anastasios G. Leventis and the A. G. Leventis Foundations, Karageor- ghis has traveled extensively throughout the world to collect material and view in person as many objects as possible. In his selection he gives priority to objects with known provenience, those that are complete, and those iconographically and stylistically unusual. Karageorghis's approach to his material is primarily descriptive.2 While he offers some general remarks and occasional brief discussions of the objects' significance, and aims to show the general development of Cypriot coroplastic art, he regards his contribution principally as a "nucleus" that will serve as a basis for more detailed stud- ies in the future. However, despite his caveat the short sections under the headings of "Introduction," "General Remarks," and "Comments" throughout the book contain many valuable insights in addition to pointing the way to future work. Within a broad chronological framework, each volume is arranged according to "types," which for the most part correspond to subject (e.g., horse-and-riders, ship models) and/or attitude (e.g., seated nude females), with further refinement in some cases deriving from additional stylistic and technological details (e.g., bird-like faces, mold-made construction). Each listed example includes a detailed description. Although this format generally succeeds in providing an easy-to-use reference for the reader, it does have certain drawbacks. Sometimes the classification system separates objects that, from an archaeological perspective, could more meaningfully be grouped together. This difficulty be- comes particularly acute for the Archaic period, for which much of the listed material has a known provenience. Be- cause of the work's organization, groups from the same site or even the same deposit are split up, both within an indi- vidual volume and among the various volumes (III, IV, and presumably the forthcoming V and VI), so the character of the groups is obscured. To some extent, the reader can re- construct the groups through the index, and volume IV in- cludes an extremely helpful listing of proveniences at the back. Perhaps the final volume in the series could include a comprehensive index according to provenience. The pitfalls of the classification system are perhaps best illustrated by the entries for cart and boat models: those with crew or passenger appeared in volume IV, the empty ones will be included in volume VI. The approach also does not work well for the long time span and ex- tremely heterogeneous material in volume I, for which the numerical designations of the classification become ex- tremely complex and difficult to follow. The inclusion of the type designations in the recto running heads of each page facilitates use and alleviates this problem in subse- quent volumes. The illustrations-perhaps the most important aspect of a work of this kind-are excellent and profuse, with only rare exceptions.3 Many drawings supplement the pri- mary black-and-white photographs, and various views are frequently presented. The quality of the photos is occa- sionally uneven, but this is the inevitable result of such a variety of sources. Volume IV also includes color plates of excellent quality, which very usefully illustrate the ef- fect of the painted decoration. The maps in each volume showing the sites mentioned are also a welcome feature. Volume I contains the widest variety of material, since Cypriot terracottas do not become "truly repetitive" until the end of the Middle Bronze Age when clearly defin- able "types" develop that can be illustrated with a few ex- amples. Quantities known from the Chalcolithic through the Middle Cypriot are also fewer, making division into groups more difficult (except in the case of plank-shaped figurines). There are few complete examples from the Chalco- lithic period, most of them from settlements, and Kara- georghis treats each individually. The discussion is limited by the scope of the work, which prevents the terracottas from being considered in conjunction with the more nu- merous Chalcolithic stone figurines, to which they are cer- tainly related. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases are also included for this period, although they are omitted in the listings for subsequent periods. Chapters covering the Early and Middle Bronze Age nevertheless include a wide variety of objects: figurines, models, "scenic compo- sitions," and figures attached to vases. Where their prove- nience is known, the vast majority come from tombs, in particular the large and extensively excavated cemeteries of Lapithos and Vounous. Examples in the White Painted Ware technique are grouped together in a separate chapter, even though some relate closely to Red Polished types. Volume II is the smallest of the four volumes. The for- mat highlights the huge change in coroplastic production between the Late Cypriot I and Late Cypriot II periods, a revolution that reflects broader religious, social, economic, and probably political changes that took place in Cyprus at the end of the Middle Bronze Age. Karageorghis connects the standardization of types ("mass production") in Late Cypriot II-III to a possible standardization of religious beliefs. His brief discussion of the major stylistic changes in LC IIIA-B is also useful. Since the material becomes more repetitive, the con- tent of volume II (and subsequent volumes) is more se- lective, although the criteria for selection are not always consistent. Most entries are free-standing figurines, a few of them attached to vases; also included here are rhyta,</page><page sequence="3">80 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 304 "model sanctuaries," some bottles, a few anthropomorphic vessels, and the utilitarian objects called "mousetraps." Only occasionally do the wit and imagination of earlier periods reemerge. Cypro-Archaic I-II is the most prolific period for cor- oplastic art, with an abundance of large-scale sculpture starting in the seventh century B.C. The floruit is brief, however, starting to decline by the beginning of the sixth century B.C., while limestone prospered under increasing influence from Greek sculpture. In this period the archae- ological record begins to provide groups of figurines from sanctuaries, surveyed excellently in chapter I of the third volume. Karageorghis considers all statues in this volume to be votaries (some, in fact, may be actual portraits), al- though it is unclear how the Bes (No. 92) and the two "Geryons" (Nos. 105-6) conform to such an interpretation. Volume III is organized differently, by "styles" as de- fined by Gjerstad (1948), and includes additional chapters synthesizing costumes and accessories and a brief treat- ment of manufacturing techniques; a separate chapter on masks completes the volume. Partly due to the grouping by types, the sculpture appears rather monotonous at first, but Karageorghis's commentary highlights the subtle dis- tinctions in gestures and expression and provides helpful insight into schools and workshops. Karageorghis does not always agree with Gjerstad's chronology, but due to the stylistic approach the bases for the differences remain primarily subjective. While many entries in this volume have known prove- niences, most are from sites investigated in the late 19th century, when the usual practice was to collect only the heads of statues (cf. Goring 1988). No records of the ex- act context were kept and circumstances of the finds were never adequately published. Publications of scientifically excavated examples are very rare (e.g., Gjerstad et al. 1935: 642-824; Young and Young 1955; Serwint 1992; Buitron-Oliver 1996). Of particular interest here is the inclusion of unpublished material discovered more re- cently, such as groups from Amathus (Nos. 258-72) and Yeroskipou (pp. 70-71), although they, too, still lack de- tailed information on context. A vast amount of material is available in the class cov- ered by volume IV; therefore a much smaller percentage of the total could be included. Sometimes the male/female distinction appears rather arbitrary, as these small figures frequently are not rendered with sufficient detail. Nor is there a sharp natural division between the smaller statues of volume III and the larger figurines here: some are very close in size and are stylistically comparable. One notable difference is the occurrence of many small horse-and-rider figures, while few large examples of this type are known. Precise dating of these small figures is also difficult be- cause of their conservative character. An appendix to volume IV provides the results of PIXE analysis of the clay bodies and pigments of six ex- amples from the Louvre. These results, too, demonstrate Cypriot conservatism and lead to the conclusion that the technique still used was one that had long been aban- doned on mainland Greece. The Coroplastic Art of Ancient Cyprus successfully achieves the author's goal of raising questions for future research. Some of these questions address fundamental is- sues, such as terracotta's relationship to stone sculpture, comparisons between large- and small-scale pieces, their use in tombs as opposed to sanctuaries. Others are more specific: Why does the number of figurines increase sub- stantially in Late Cypriot II? Why do more small Archaic figures carry objects than do large-scale? Why are chariot models known only from sanctuaries, but horses and riders from both tombs and sanctuaries? The examination of these and other questions is seri- ously hindered by problems of chronology and prove- nience. In selecting objects for inclusion in this catalog, Karageorghis gave preference to those with known prove- nience (cf. volume IV, p. xi) but these still constitute a very small proportion of all those listed. This lack of ar- chaeological context for the vast majority of Cypriot ter- racottas substantially undermines their potential for study and interpretation. First, their chronology is based mainly on "stylistic development." In fact, there are entire classes of objects with no datable examples. Of the "earliest" group of 55 horse-and-rider figures, assigned to Cypro-Archaic I, only one comes from an excavated context. In another group, the piece that "may be one of the earliest examples of this type" is known only from an illustration in a Christie's catalog (volume IV, p. 74, fig. 42). Karageorghis is well aware of the difficulty and repeatedly calls attention to the inherent chronological uncertainties.4 The lack of context-even the simple fact of whether they come from a settlement, a tomb, or a sanctuary- also precludes meaningful studies of the function and use of these terracottas. Are they votives, cult images, toys? Did different types have different functions? And while Karageorghis attempts to assign certain pieces, on stylis- tic grounds alone, to particular "hands" or "workshops," there is no firm basis upon which to examine regional or local styles or techniques. Even the results of scientific analysis are of limited value: PIXE analysis revealed that the pigments on one of the figures tested were unusual and not from Cyprus; but because the piece is without provenience, the significance of this finding is unclear. Does it indicate the product of a distinct workshop, or is the figure retouched or even fake? In many cases, the lack of archaeological context must be recognized as simply the unfortunate result of the his- tory of archaeology on Cyprus (cf. Goring 1988). Kara- georghis's tireless search into the collections of many European and North American museums to assemble this catalog has provided an incomparable service to future</page><page sequence="4">1996 BOOK REVIEWS 81 generations of scholars. However, his inclusion of a large amount of material from private collections raises several difficult issues. Some of these collections are held in Cyprus and thus are subject to strict legal protection: they must be regis- tered with the Department of Antiquities (to whom any transfer of ownership must be reported) and they cannot be exported without a permit. A large number of objects comes from the Hadjiprodromou Collection, located in Famagusta in 1974 when the town was invaded and, with a few exceptions, not seen since. It is perhaps useful to publish this material (along with objects held at that time in the Famagusta District Museum), so that anything that appears on the market can be recognized and recovered.5 In any case, private collections in other countries have no such restraints, and publication will inevitably serve to enhance the value of the pieces that subsequently come onto the antiquities market (cf. Cook 1991; Elia 1993). For example, many of the listed terracottas belong to the Desmond Morris Collection, which has persistently been reported to be for sale in recent years.6 And as prices rise, they further increase the economic incentives for plunder- ing archaeological sites to provide more objects for the market. The role of scholars in promoting the prestige that collectors continue to enjoy-despite their direct participation in a network involving criminals, smugglers, and general sleaziness-has recently received increased scrutiny (Gill and Chippindale 1993; Elia 1993; Renfrew 1993). To address this issue, the Board of Trustees of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR) adopted a policy ("ASOR Policy on Preservation of Archaeologi- cal Resources") in November 1995 stating that its mem- bers should refrain from activities such as publication that enhance the commercial value of artifacts illegally ex- cavated or exported from their country of origin after 1970.7 The date, although somewhat arbitrary, attempts to draw a distinction between recently looted and illicitly exported objects and a preexisting "legal" trade in objects acquired before international controls went into effect. A number of terracottas included in Coroplastic Art of An- cient Cyprus are indeed documented as belonging to "old collections" such as the Erlenmeyer or Bomford, many of which have returned to the auction block (cf. Gill and Chippindale 1993: 607). But it must be recognized that even these objects, their value enhanced by publication, will serve to stimulate the antiquities market in general and encourage further looting. In any case, it is difficult to see any justification for including, as Karageorghis does, a number of pieces that are only known from auc- tion house and dealer catalogs, since in almost all cases they remain inaccessible to scholars because their present location is unknown. Most troubling are the cases in which collectors acquire without ethical guidelines and buy more recently looted items. The activities of George Ortiz have attracted con- siderable attention in this regard (e.g., Greenfield 1989: 168-77),8 yet several pieces from his collection are in- cluded in this work. Several arguments are customarily made to defend the publication or exhibition of material without provenience. One of these, used vociferously on behalf of the Ortiz exhibition (above, n. 8), is that the aesthetic experience should take precedence and works of art should be shown for their own sake. Yet in very few cases would Cypriot terracottas be considered "works of art," significant for their aesthetic qualities alone.9 Certainly the heavily re- stored plank figurine owned by Shelby White and Leon Levy (volume I, pp. 65-66, no. 20)-to use an example from another well-known collection (cf. Renfrew 1993)- has little aesthetic appeal, even to this reviewer, who is as passionate as anyone about the Cypriot Early Bronze Age. Others have accused those scholars who refuse, on ethical grounds, to discuss unprovenienced material of "in- tellectual censorship" (e.g., Boardman 1995),10 although in this case, Karageorghis had no intention of compiling a complete corpus. When a work is already selective, as this one is, the issue becomes instead what factors should con- stitute the criteria used in the selection. The most common defense for the publication of ma- terial without provenience is that, in spite of the limita- tions, some knowledge can be gained from it. This claim becomes harder and harder to maintain, however, in the light of recent meticulous examinations of certain classes of objects (e.g., Getty Kouros Colloquium 1992; Gill and Chippindale 1993) which have demonstrated that little knowledge can be gained when the very authenticity of the pieces is doubtful.11 While Karageorghis acknowledges the presence of fakes on the market (volume I, p. 89) and labels as a forgery a piece previously published by another scholar (volume II, p. 8), The Coroplastic Art of Ancient Cyprus still includes numerous unique, unparalleled examples without prove- nience, the authenticity and/or Cypriot origin of which must be considered questionable (cf. Butcher and Gill 1993 for a comparable situation). Particularly notable among these are a figure in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens (volume I, fig. 139) and the piece that has pride of place in the series (volume I, no. 1), the "Ejaculator," which in spite of doubts about its Cypriot origin has come to be widely regarded as one of the benchmarks of Cypriot Chalcolithic art (cf. Butcher and Gill 1993: 391, 393).12 The only known example of a Late Cypriot figurine with a preserved bronze earring comes from a Sotheby's catalog (volume II, p. 4, no. 3); all other earrings known are clay, thus casting doubt on the use of metal for this purpose in the Late Bronze Age. Karageorghis considers another anomalous Late Cypriot example, the only figurine perfo- rated for a nose ring, to be the "latest in the series" because of its "debased" fabric; but a conclusion that it is a fake</page><page sequence="5">82 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 304 seems equally viable (volume II, pp. 5, 22, no. 13). On the other hand, two other unique Late Bronze Age figures (vol- ume II, pp. 15, 23, no. 4; p. 32, no. 1) have irreproachable archaeological contexts, without which they, too, would have been extremely suspect, although Karageorghis does not consider the possibility that the former may have been imported. The Coroplastic Art ofAncient Cyprus brings deserved attention to the rich coroplastic tradition of Cyprus and makes this scattered material accessible to scholars in all fields. It is already serving its intended purpose of stimu- lating and assisting new studies of terracottas. It securely takes its place as one of the standard references in Cypriot archaeology, an achievement for which Karageorghis is to be thanked and congratulated. Ellen Herscher Washington, DC NOTES 1The remaining two volumes will complete the pre- sentation of smaller Cypro-Archaic I-II figurines: an- thropomorphic female (Volume V) and zoomorphic and miscellaneous (Volume VI). 2More interpretive and analytical recent studies of Cypriot terracottas can be found in Vandenabeele and Laffineur 1991. 31 was disappointed by the absence of illustrations in volume III of No. 42, apparently the only large-scale female example of the First Proto-Cypriot style, and the unusual life size African woman (No. 241). 4For example, the only complete example of a group of dancers around a "sacred" tree is dated to the fourth cen- tury B.C. "but could well be earlier (6th century?)" (vol- ume IV, p. 134). 5 Although it also may be argued that publication warns would-be sellers to keep their transactions secret: the objects from the Hadjiprodromou Collection that have so far been recovered were offered for sale publicly and claimed by reference to a confidential catalog. The emer- gence of Hadjiprodromou pieces seems to have stopped after it became known that documentation existed for proving rightful ownership (Cook 1991, p. 533; cf. Coro- plastic Art of Ancient Cyprus, volume I, p. ix). 6Although Morris published a catalog of his collection himself in 1985, one assumes that Karageorghis's impri- matur is more valuable in the field of antiquities. 7 The date of UNESCO's adoption of the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Im- port, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Prop- erty. Other professional archaeological organizations, such as the Archaeological Institute of America, have similar policies. 8An exhibition of objects from Ortiz's collection at the Royal Academy in London in 1994 attracted widespread criticism: e.g., Renfrew (1994); Fenton (1994). 9None of the Ortiz terracottas listed by Karageorghis were included in the exhibition at the Royal Academy. However, the exhibition did include a bronze figurine "allegedly" from Cyprus and dated to LC II, an attribu- tion that must be highly suspect since the piece bears no re- semblance to anything known in Cyprus. 10Boardman wrote the foreword to the catalog of the Ortiz exhibition. " While scholarly awareness of this issue has only recently begun to receive intense discussion, the pio- neering-and generally ignored-study of the problem (Muscarella 1977) appeared 20 years ago. 12Because of their unusual nature and lack of prove- nience, questions must also be raised about the odd monkey riding a horse (volume IV, p. 94, no. 4), the only example of the type; the group of Cypro-Archaic riders on animals other than horses (volume IV, pp. 95-97); figures carrying unusual objects (volume IV, p. 59, no. 8; p. 138, no. 9); three figures with legs (volume IV, pp. 59-60); and the boat model from a Charles Ede Ltd. catalog (volume IV, p. 131). In addition, a few examples simply do not appear genuine, at least in the illustrations presented, such as a vase from a Charles Ede Ltd. catalog (volume I, pl. 118.4).
