<plain_text><page sequence="1">Landscape and Counter- Landscape in the Poetry of William Cullen Bryant KINERETH MEYER .IIBLISHED in 1898, Edmund Clarence Stedman's Poets of America is less a work of analysis and interpretation than one of critical boosterism.' Stedman evaluates popular nineteenth-century poets (William Cullen BryantJohn Greenleaf Whittier, Emer- son, and Whitman, among others) in terms of patriotic feel- ing rather than literary excellence, and thus attaches particu- lar importance to the relationship between the American poet and American geography. His analysis of the connec- tions between poetry and place is unabashedly unicultural: while he dismisses the native population as little more than part of the scenery ("the aborigines of a country are almost a part of its mould" [p. 45]), he calls the early settlers' contem- plation of the land "objective" and considers such objectivity evidence of advanced cultural development. The race that settled America, claims Stedman, had succeeded in reaching the heights of "analysis and reflective art" necessary for land- I Poets of America (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1885; repub. Grosse Pointe, Mich.: Scholarly Press, 1968). In his introduction Stedman claims that "the literature-even the poetic literature-of no country, during the last half-century, is of greater interest to the philosophical student, with respect to its bearing on the future, than that of the United States" (p. ix).

To the sophisticated reader attuned to the nuances of ideology, there is something more than a little funny about a critic who lauds "objectivity" while patently reinforcing a very specific rhetorical version of American settlement. As stilted and narrow as Stedman's criticism may sound to us, however, it drives home an important point about much of nineteenth- century American poetry, namely, that it was largely dedicated to reaffirming a fiction that had figured prominently in writ- ten accounts from the beginnings of European settlement- the originary possession of an untamed land. Supported by a rhetoric that embraced both the primeval (sublime) and the idyllic rural (pastoral) landscape, this fiction was particularly highlighted during the nineteenth century, a period of excep- tionally aggressive agricultural and urban expansion. While their compatriots were engaged in the physical appropriation of the land, Longfellow and Whittier, Bryant and Whitman, Emerson and Thoreau were engaged in working out the com- plex relationship between land (the material terrain, the his- torical entity) and landscape (the terrain framed and shaped by a particular individual or group of individuals).2 The fiction of the eternally possessible land was particu- larly problematic for William Cullen Bryant. Although Bryant is often considered a poet of "domestic and natural harmo- 2 John R. Stilgoe has rightly pointed out that "landscape is a slippery word."

On the problematic nature of defining "landscape," see also John Brinckerhoff Jackson, Discovering the Vernacular Landscape (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1984), pp. 3-8; and Leo Marx's foreword to Views of American Landscapes, ed. Mick Gidley and Robert Lawson-Peebles (Cambridge: Cam- bridge Univ. Press, 1989), pp. xv-xxii. Related studies include Wayne Franklin's Discoverers, Explorers, Settlers: The Diligent Writers of Early America (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1979); although it concentrates on the early stages of American settlement, Franklin's book has important implications for the continuous testing of the adequacy of language to perception in American landscape texts (see esp. pp. 1- 19). In New World, New Earth: Environmental Reform in American Literature from the Puritans through Whitman (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1979), Cecelia Tichi consid- ers the history of land and landscape in America in terms of environmental reform, "the orderly impress of civilization that defined amorphous space" (p. viii).

For Bryant, writing a poetry of place car- ried with it the concomitant danger of the dis-placement, even obliteration, of the "untouched" land with his "barbarous pen." His poems, I argue in this essay, evoke a crisis of artistic "ownership" arising in the act of representation itself. To his contemporaries William Cullen Bryant was nothing less than a hierophantic figure who inter- preted the mysteries of American nature to the multitudes. Whitman, describing a nearly specular image of himself, called Bryant the "bard of the river and the wood, ever con- veying a taste of open air, with scents as from hayfields, grapes, birch-borders."4 Others saw him in a more specifi- cally religious role: "His thoughts go beyond external appear- ances," wrote William J. Snelling in 1832, "to dwell upon things not visible to common mortals."5 Stedman called Bry- ant "the Druid of our forests, the high priest of Nature in her elemental types" (p. 47). This emphasis on the moral and spiritual attributes of landscape brings to mind Thomson and Wordsworth, as well as Emerson and Thoreau. But while Bryant's work was as widely read-perhaps even more widely read-in his own day as that of these writers, today his name rarely appears on reading lists in American literature or culture courses, and 3 Bernard Duffey, Poetry in America: Expression and Its Values in the Times of Bryant, Whztman, and Pound (Durham, N.C.: Duke Univ.

In the words of Bernard Duffey, Bryant's poetry often seems to be "thrumming away at established sentiments," "sedulously regular in form and seeming equal- ly uninspired in idea and feeling" (p. 6). To judge by this and other recent assessments, it is clear that Edgar Allan Poe's 1846 comment, "it will never do to claim for Bryant a genius of the loftiest order" has not been significantly challenged by subsequent generations of critics.6 Most have considered Bry- ant more as a national monument than as a poet worthy of serious critical attention. It is thus not surprising that Roy Harvey Pearce excluded Bryant from his rubric of the "antinominian, Adamic" individ- ual ensured with the continuity of American poetry.7 Unlike poets such as Poe, Whitman, and Dickinson, who, according to Pearce, "called into question received definitions," Bryant, "be- fitting his role, could only confirm them." Pearce sees Bryant's world as "closed," "bounded by the sensibilities of the people whom he taught and to whose needs for self-assurance he so grandly ministered" (pp. 2og-1 o). In his condescension toward the reading public, and in his view of Bryant as "genteel," "cautious," and "comfort- ing," Pearce echoes the critical stance of a generation influ- enced by T. S. Eliot and the modernists. In our own critical era, when concepts of literary reception and literary can- onization are being reexamined, Bryant's appeal to the pop- ular imagination, so loftily disparaged by Pearce, is not nec- essarily a negative characteristic. On the contrary, I would argue that his poems may indicate as much about nine- teenth-century America-and about later developments in American poetry-as those more "antinominian" works valo- rized by Pearce. Pearce's comments are a forceful reminder that we can never "re-create" other periods in the present; they will always be other. We cannot ask Bryant to speak to 6 Godey's Magazine and Lady's Book, 32 (1846), 183. 7 The Continuity of American Poetry (Princeton: Princeton Univ.

We shall discover, I suggest, that continuity may inhere in the failure of Bryant's poems to sustain the mythic in the face of the material America. What appears to be a lack of inspiration in Bryant's poems-their "cautious," "genteel" orthodoxy-is a form of depersonalization and abstraction deriving from the exigencies of the poet's role as Emer- sonian "land-lord!" or verbal appropriator.8 Hyatt H. Waggoner was more sensitive than Pearce to the interpretive possibilities in Bryant's poems, but his analy- sis stops short of a larger historical and cultural insight. Com- menting on the "imagistic incoherence" in Bryant's poems, Waggoner says that it "parallels if it does not reflect the inco- herence of a poet who could write 'The Ages,' celebrating Progress, yet propose a return to Nature as the cure for the 'guilt and misery' of which he found the world full."9 What Waggoner calls "incoherence" was in fact a duality deeply rooted in American history: America as a geographical and historical entity in which land is considered a commodity or a speculative investment, and America as icon in which land is viewed as a moral emblem.Lo This duality was transposed into artistic terms as follows: if, as Emerson put it in Nature, "there is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eyes can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet" (Selected Writings, pp. 5-6; empha- sis added), then landscape, like the land itself, becomes a product of consumption like any other, capable of being owned ("property") and traded on the open market. As such, it becomes the antithesis of the ideal expressed by Bryant's "kindred spirit," the painter Thomas Cole: 8 See Ralph Waldo Emerson, "The Poet," in The Selected Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed.

I The aesthetic touches the political at this point; Manifest Destiny can be seen not only as a nineteenth-century political and economic program but as a rhetorical one as well. The duality of land and landscape is, in effect, a dialectic: un- touched scenes of solitude from which the hand of nature has never been lifted had to be repeatedly affirmed in order to generate a continual replay of America's "primal scene" of discovery and possession. It was necessary for American rheto- ric, including American poetry, to persist in emphasizing an untouched nature in order tojustify continued expansion and appropriation. Although nineteenth-century politicians may have phrased it differently, they were in fact carrying out the Puritan imperative to settle the so-called "vacant" land: "It is a principle in nature, that in a vacant soil he that taketh posses- sion of it, and bestoweth culture and husbandry upon it, his right it is. ..."12 In their glib synthesis of land as commodity and land as icon, Bryant's early poems provide abundant evidence for Myra Jehlen's astute observation that the early ideal of the American individualist included both poet and capitalist.'3 At the age of thirteen, Bryant already gave voice to a dual commercial/poetic ideal in "The Embargo" (1 8o8), a preco- cious satire on early-nineteenth-century America. He lam- poons everyone from the Federalists to the Democrats, charg- ing the Muse of Satire to "wake . .. in the cause of trade," to "hurl . . .

Lurking beneath the "received definitions" and conventionalities of his more mature verse, one detects a destructive counter-landscape that threatened both sublime and pastoral fictions of the American land- scape. This counter-landscape not only reflects nineteenth- century territorial and economic expansion; it also maps the poet's fears of his own destructive powers. For in realizing the land through represention, Bryant participated in a simi- larly appropriative activity. Few readers have noted what may be called the dark underside of Bryant's poetry; "Bryant often '4 "The Embargo, or, Sketches of the Times; A Satire," in Representative Selec- tions, p. 342. '5 In this poem the conflict between an idyllic agrarian landscape (the "peaceful lea") and a grim cityscape ("the close alleys of the town") is ultimately resolved in a third landscape that takes "Embargo" one step further: all images point in the direction of new markets and material gain-resurrection in the name of export. Speaking to the sower as agent of a saving grace, the poet maps out a system of mighty trade routes: "Then, as thy garners give thee forth, / On what glad errands shalt thou go, / Wherever, o'er the waiting earth, / Roads wind and rivers flow! / The ancient East shall welcome thee / To mighty marts beyond the sea, / And they who dwell where palm-groves sound / To summer winds the whole year round, / Shall watch, in gladness, from the shore, / The sails that bring thy glistening store." Significantly, the editors of the popular illustrated "Household Edition" of Bryant's works chose to accompany "The Song of the Sower" with a sketch of a bustling harbor filled with schooners, clippers, and small rowboats; a dense urban metropolis is visible on the horizon (Poetical Works of William Cullen Bryant, Household Edition [New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1896], p. 249; unless noted otherwise, all quota- tions from Bryant are from this edition).</page><page sequence="8">LANDSCAPE IN BRYANT 201 dealt with death," is about as far as these observations go.'6 Bryant's interest in death, however, was not only confined to poems such as "Thanatopsis." His view of the landscape also reflected this preoccupation, revealing on the one hand a fear of the annihilation of the self amid the vast expanses of American space, and on the other hand a fear of the oblitera- tion of the land as a result of his fiction making. Thus, in Bryant's poetry, anxiety regarding the nonverbal hegemony of the image alternates with anxiety regarding the destruc- tive power of the word; iconophobia is countered by an equally powerful logophobia.'7 The poetic result ranges any- where from linguistic self-limitation to the complete "surren- der" of the word-silence, non-poetry. Even the much- anthologized "Green River" (1821; Poetical Works, pp. 27-29), a rather conventional landscape-as-self-reflection poem, is constrained by self-limiting strategies. The very first stanza, for example, filled with rich images of the colors, lights, and shadows of the golden autumn day, is immediately qualified by a stanza that attempts to "preserve" the isolation of the scene from human contact, including that of the poet: Yet, fair as thou art, thou shunnest to glide, Beautiful stream! by the village side; But windest away from haunts of men, To quiet valley and shaded glen.... The more generalized mass of humanity-the "haunts of men"-is contrasted with a dramatis personae presumably de- 16 See Allen J. Koppenhaver, "The Dark View of Things: The Isolated Figure in the American Landscapes of Cole and Bryant," in Views of American Landscapes, p. 185. Koppenhaver rightly observes the "strong if elusive darker strain in Bryant's work," but fails to investigate the possible etiology of this darker strain. Exceptions to the general critical insensitivity to this element in Bryant's poetry include Albert Gelpi, The Tenth Muse: The Psyche of the American Poet (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1975), pp. 3, 63, 67; and Lawrence Buell, New England Literary Culture: From Revolution through Renaissance (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986), p. io8. Buell points out that Bryant often "flirts with a nihilistic view of death" (p. i08). Whitman was also sensitive to the preoccupation with death in Bryant's poetry, noting that the poet was "always lurkingly fond of threnodies-beginning and end- ing his long career with chants of death" ("My Tribute," in Specimen Days, p. 267).

And yet all three, includ- ing the "idle dreamer" who has described the scene so lav- ishly, take from nature, diminishing, even if minimally, its abundant presence. The irony of the poem is that in taking from nature, the dreamer/poet is part of the same civiliza- tion, the same "haunts of men," that he envies the river for avoiding. For, as a poet, he has been: ... forced to drudge for the dregs of men, And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen, And mingle among the jostling crowd, Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud. Is his pen "barbarous" in that it, like the tools of the "sons of strife," violates nature's integrity? Are his words ''strange" because they distort the terrain into a language totally alien to its powerful (nonverbal) presence? Usually seen as a poem of escape, "Green River" is rather a poem of disappointment and futile nostalgia, in which the making of images may be nothing but a narcissistic pose that obviates speech ("I often come to this quiet place, / To breathe the airs that ruffle thy face, / And gaze upon thee in silent dream"). In spite of the escape narrative that "Green River" tells, we remain at the end with the exact opposite of an untouched nature-solipsism, where all is absorbed into the self. The river cannot remain inviolable after the intrusion of what Wallace Stevens called "the murderous alphabet."'18 Once present in the scene, the poet transforms land into landscape by seeing it in his own image. Stephen Fender has pointed to "a sense of dislocation" in American landscape writing. 19 "An Indian at the Burial-Place of His Fathers" (1824; Poetical Works, pp. 58-60) reflects this sense of dislocation: the idyllic landscape-in this case sub- 18 See "The Man with the Blue Guitar" (1937), in The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1961), p. 179. 19 See "American Landscape and the Figure of Anticipation: Paradox and Re- course," in Views of American Landscapes, p. 5 2.</page><page sequence="10">LANDSCAPE IN BRYANT 203 lime rather than pastoral-is historically and imagistically dis- placed, both by the fact of the appropriation of Indian lands and by the image-traces of a barren counter-landscape that threatens artistic idealizations of space. The conflict within the poet's own sympathies presented in "An Indian" is, in effect, a conflict between colonial and transcendentalist attitudes toward landscape. From the out- set the imagery and the organization of the poem attempt to encompass both the seventeenth-century imperative of be- stowing "culture and husbandry" on the wilderness and the nineteenth-century glorification of nature as the "plantations of God": For here the upland bank sends out A ridge toward the river-side; I know the shaggy hills about, The meadows smooth and wide, The plains, that, toward the southern sky, Fenced east and west by mountains lie. (Stanza 2) In terms of organization, the stanzas are interrelated according to a principle of what may be called progressive projection-a white man (Bryant) imagining an Indian imag- ining a white man, all imagined by the reader, who contem- plates the same landscape. Only apparently linear, projection becomes an exercise in mutual specularity, in which all inter- preters, including poet and reader, aestheticize nature: A white man, gazing on the scene, Would say a lovely spot was here, And praise the lawns, so fresh and green, Between the hills so sheer. I like it not-I would the plain Lay in its tall old groves again. While the white settler is seen as confining his vision to the meadows and cultivated lawns that lie between the "hills so sheer," the Indian's vision reaches the sublime heights of ma- jestic mountains and woods. However, like many of the pas- sages in Wordsworth's The Prelude that begin with the words</page><page sequence="11">204 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE "as if,"20 the Indian's fantasy ("a white man. . . would say") and his wishful "I would" suggest an awareness of his own fictionalizing, an acute sense of the absence and loss of the material referent in the very act of image making. The poem continues to limn a failed vision: Methinks it were a nobler sight To see these vales in woods arrayed, Their summits in the golden light, Their trunks in grateful shade, And herds of deer that bounding go O'er hills and prostrate trees below. This metapoetic dimension-the self-conscious aware- ness in the poem of the constraints that history imposes upon the image-makes it an elegy both for the land and for the landscape. Even nostalgia proves untenable here, however, since the "hard fact" of westward settlement gradually over- takes the Indian sublime: They waste us-ay-like April snow In the warm noon, we shrink away; And fast they follow, as we go Toward the setting day- Till they shall fill the land, and we Are driven into the Western sea. The Indian accurately reads the signs of his own de- mise as a demographic force. It is thus a kind of poetic justice that he is the one who has the ability to read the "fearful sign" of the white man's fall, a fall that will be nothing less than a total and encompassing cancellation: "Their race may vanish hence, like mine, / And leave no trace behind. . . ." Is this Bryant's attempt to assuage his guilt and insecurity at the historical and artistic price of nineteenth-century westward expansion? Can it be read as a self-erasure, a kind of poetic suicide? Significantly, Bryant 20 See, for example, the boat-stealing episode in the first book of The Prelude (11. 375-85), and the "as if awakened" section in Book III, 11. 108-14. See also Kinereth Meyer, "Speaking and Writing the Lyric 'I,' " Genre, 22 (1989), 138-39.</page><page sequence="12">LANDSCAPE IN BRYANT 205 "stops" his own (linguistic) appropriation of the Indian's no- ble vision: summoning a silence, or non-writing, that blocks the aesthetic domestication of uncultivated space, Bryant also purports to "leave no trace behind": Those grateful sounds are heard no more, The springs are silent in the sun; The rivers, by the blackened shore, With lessening current run; The realm our tribes are crushed to get May be a barren desert yet. Neither beautiful nor sublime, the barren desert is a pure absence, a pre-T. S. Eliot wasteland toward which all images in the poem move. Although twentieth-century read- ers may read these lines as a prophetic expression of ecologi- cal concern, they may also be read as the absent center of nineteenth-century American landscape poetry-the poet's self-imposed erasure of his own idealizations of space. It is important to keep in mind, of course, that the ideological conflict in the poem-the Rousseauesque noble avage in an untamed environment versus the inexorable movement of white colonization-was more than a subject for poetry; it informed nineteenth-century political agendas regarding land use, it fed conflicts between industry and agriculture, and it colored attitudes toward the native popu- lation. Rather than attempting to resolve this conflict in "An Indian at the Burial-Place of His Fathers," Bryant re- treats from it by voiding-literally emptying-the images of America (rural landscape and raw nature) that he has just posed. The millenial vision of a glorious future, so preva- lent in nineteenth-century texts, is overtaken in "An In- dian" by a counter-landscape in which the object of posses- sion cherished by America's first settlers-the Promised Land-reverts to a barren desert. Like the silent dream of "Green River," the silent spring and blackened shore mark not only the burial place of the Indian fathers, they also mark the momentary death of poetic fictions-landscapes- of America.</page><page sequence="13">206 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE Interestingly, while the history of land de- velopment in America reveals a collective, corporate venture in the molding of space to fit human needs,21 nineteenth- century poetry in general, and Bryant's poetry in particular, presents a different picture entirely. For Bryant, the single individual in the landscape is more than a representative of community land use; he or she is a rhetorical device where- by the most radical components of the act of representation in landscape poetry-the vast terrain and the individual perceiver-are abstracted into their basic functions. The individually framed landscape functions in Ameri- can landscape art as a metonymy for unconstrained space, what Whitman called "that vast Something, stretching out on its own unbounded scale."22 In the receding hills of Asher Durand's Hills, Dale, and Bracken (undated), in the vast ex- panse of sky in Frederic Church's Twilight in the Wilderness (i86o; fig. i), or in the upwardly directed spatial composition of Albert Bierstadt's Mount Whitney-Grandeur of the Rockies (1875; fig. 2), we see the parallel of Thoreau's lusty brag: "Wherever I sat, there I might live, and the landscape radi- ated from me accordingly."23 Whitman encompassed in his individual vision "worlds and volumes of worlds." "I resist anything better than my own diversity. .. ," he wrote, "and am not stuck up, and am in my place."24 His place, of course, 21 Sacvan Bercovitch, The Puritan Origins of the American Self (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1975), pp. 170, 173, sees the relationship between individual and envi- ronmental space in terms of a "corporate teleology," a "conflation of the private with the national dream." Jackson, pp. 7-8, gives similar priority to the collective over the individual, defining landscape as man-made space for collective existence. Stilgoe, in his important work on American land development, defines landscape as "shaped land, modified for permanent human occupation, for dwelling, agriculture, manu- facturing, government, worship" (p. 3). 22 "The Prairies, and an Undeliver'd Speech," in Specimen Days, p. 208. 23 Walden, in The Writings of Henry D.

"I take SPACE," Charles Olson observed, "to be the cen- tral fact to man born in America."25 Bryant found the vastness of American space troubling, for it potentiated the threat of both solipsism and depersonalization, neither of which corre- sponded to his conception of the poet as the transmitter of a clear spiritual and ethical vision.26On one level, the single per- ceiver in the landscape-a recurrent convention in American texts from Samuel Sewell's paean to Plum Island to Emerson's transparent eyeball to Stevens's singer at Key West and beyond-is, as "Green River" and "An Indian" suggest, the ultimate solipsist.

Albert Bierstadt, Mount Whitney-Grandeur of the Rockies (courtesy of The Rockwell Museum, Corning, New York) from the social, historical self interacting with others in a com- munal landscape, the stance of the lone individual in the land- scape can also be seen as a de-personalization, a distillation of human activity into its fewest possible components and into its narrowest dimensions-one individual amid boundless space. Thus, while the position of the isolated perceiver implies that he or she is sole proprietor of space, it can also be read as a minimalization, an attempt to sustain an illusion of non- intervention through which the vast terrain will remain "un- framed" in spite of the framing activity of the landscape poet. The paradox of representation in landscape poetry is that a depersonalized, abstract relationship between individual and scene can at the same time be read as narcissism carried to its furthest extreme, where the single individual, "in the wilder- ness, alone," becomes the sole source of vision and speech. In '832 Bryant paid a visit to his brother on the Illinois prairie. A letter giving an account of that visit is written in a style of newsy reportage, filled with piquant detail. Bryant concludes the letter, however, with the admission that the language of prose is incommensurate with his experience of the prairies: "What I have thought and felt amid these bound- less wastes and awful solitudes I shall reserve for the only</page><page sequence="16">LANDSCAPE IN BRYANT 209 form of expression in which it can be properly uttered."27 Without denying the experiential basis of Bryant's response to the "boundless wastes" of the Illinois prairies, we should note that solitude also served as a rhetorical strategy in the poem Bryant based on his journey. Like "An Indian at the Burial-Place of His Fathers," "The Prairies" (1832; Poetical Works, pp. 130-33) is, on its surface, a historical narrative of American settlement. Human presence is significant in this narrative only to the extent that it is diminished, transitory. In contrast, what Thoreau called the "unhandselled globe"28 is present in all its force in "The Prairies": Man hath no power in all this glorious work: The hand that built the firmament hath heaved And smoothed these verdant swells, and sown their slopes With herbage, planted them with island groves, And hedged them round with forests. The paradox of depersonalization, or dehumanization as the ultimate solipsism, is evident even in this description of nature untouched by human hands. In using speech to de- scribe what he sees as a purely nonhuman presence, the poet becomes a force of interference, even power. The desire to obstruct his own verbal power may be the reason why Bryant is so often drawn to silence in his poetry, as in the "silent dream" of "Green River" and in the "silent springs" in the final, apocalyptic vision of "An Indian." Once the perceiver, however minimalized, is placed in the topography, and once the perceiver contains his impressions in the conventions of language, the claim "man hath no power" is obviated. More specifically, the godly source of the terrain in "The Prairies," typologically recalling the birth of the New World ("the hand 27 "A Letter from Illinois," quoted in McDowell, p. 263. As "one of the most ancient of all arts," in Bryant's words, poetry was the only language suitable for evoking the confrontation between the single individual and the boundless wastes of American space (see "On the Nature of Poetry," Lectures on Poetry, in McDowell, p. 184). 28 See Thoreau's account of his experiences on Mount Katahdin in The Maine Woods (1864), ed. Joseph J. Moldenhauer, vol. 2 of The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1972): "This was that Earth of which we have heard, made out of Chaos and Old Night. Here was no man's garden, but the unhandselled globe" (p. 70).</page><page sequence="17">210 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE that built the firmament"), is cast in the language of human activity. The preponderance of verbs, especially, embodies the American ideal of culture and husbandry: "built," "heaved," "smoothed," "sown," "planted," "hedged." Even the organiza- tion of space in the poem-the hills and island groves sur- rounded by forest-suggests the classic landschaft, a "collec- tion of dwellings and other structures crowded together within a circle of pasture, meadow, and planting fields and surrounded by unimproved forest or marsh" (Stilgoe, p. 2). Indeed, countering the premise that "man hath no power in all this glorious work," the poet is both empowered and a bestower of power in "The Prairies." What seems to be a con- ventional example of anthropomorphism is, in effect, an an- thropocentric statement worthy of Emerson. Like Adam, the poet is the Namer, conferring form upon inchoate nature through pure linguistic fiat: These are the gardens of the Desert, these The unshorn fields, boundless and beautiful, For which the speech of England has no name- The Prairies. Like Columbus, the poet reenacts America's primal scene: "I behold them for the first, / And my heart swells." And, like God, he is capable of perceiving the "encircling vastness" through his "dilated sight." He is also the Prime Mover, whose control is evoked through the ekphrastic play of the images. One moment the prairies are the undulations of the ocean made suddenly still, "with all his rounded billows fixed, / and motionless forever," as if the transformation of land into landscape fixes it in timeless, iconic significance. By the same poetic agency, how- ever, time and movement reenter the landscape: "No-they are all unchained again." The prairie-hawk is another power- ful ekphrastic image, as it "flaps his broad wings, yet moves not," allowing it to hover omnisciently (like the poet/per- ceiver?) over the vast terrain. This use of the classical trope may be read as a reflection of nineteenth-century American landscape hermeneutics, which includes the desire to freeze</page><page sequence="18">LANDSCAPE IN BRYANT 211 land into icon and the need to see the land as the ground of a dynamic, forward-moving history.29 Like Wallace Stevens's song at Key West, "The Prairies" is Bryant's idea of order, a fiction that encompasses both space and time, landscape and history. Even the forces of evil, the vestige of Puritan conceptions of space, have been domes- ticated, subdued by the poet's powerful landscape ("sliding reptiles of the ground, / Startlingly beautiful"). And yet, in spite of his power to freeze and confer movement, to read ideas of historical and spatial order in the "ancient foot- prints" of Indians and bison, as if in an occult hieroglyph, Bryant still retreats from the admission that the poet, like the settler, both appropriates and shapes the land. Listening to the bees ("a more adventurous colonist than man"), he hears the hum of "that advancing multitude / Which soon shall fill these deserts." Instead of joining their ranks, however, he stops the advancing reel of history and turns once again to the refuge of the solipsist: "A fresher wind sweeps by, and breaks my dream, / And I am in the wilderness alone." This line, Koppenhaver says, underscores "the essential alienation of the narrator from his environment" (p. i88). My reading of Bryant's poetry suggests, first, that this alien- ation has a clear etiology, and second, that it was "essential" not in the sense of natural or spontaneous (for it was self- imposed) but in the sense of absolutely necessary. Bryant's poetry is a crafted failure, an essential breaking of the dream, and a continual return to the starting point, "in the wilder- ness alone." Within the tradition of American landscape art, it is the failure to synthesize the material and the mythic that marks the continuity of American poetry.
