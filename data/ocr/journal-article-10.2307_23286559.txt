Whittaker INTRODUCTION Benjamin Winchester never forgot the Church that somehow forgot him. Writing bitterly in 1889, he recalled many of the experiences that brought him into the Church, but he stressed mostly their negative side, soured by being excommunicated in 1844.1 Yet his life represents a paradigm of individuals who, after DAVID J. WHITTAKER is the Curator of the Mormon Manuscripts, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. Much of the foundational research on Winchester was accomplished during a 1973 Summer Research Fellowship given by the Historical Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City. The author is grateful to Leonard J. Arlington, who was then Church Historian, for his support and encouragement. A 1990 Beinecke Fellowship allowed extensive research in the Strang Manuscripts at Yale University. benjamin Winchester, "Primitive Mormonism, Personal Narrative of It by Mr. Benjamin Winchester, An Early Convert and Church Elder," Salt Lake Tribune, 22 September 1889, [2].

His life is important, first, because of his contributions to the early Mormon Church. Specifically he espoused and defended its doctrines in a variety of oral and written presentations. As a missionary he was instrumental in bringing upwards of eight hundred people into the Church.2 Second, a study of his life offers valuable insights into many aspects of the early Church, in par ticular, its early missionary work, the literature and the personnel of these proselyting thrusts, and the resulting stresses and strains of the Church's early growth.3 Finally a detailed study of his life offers a new perspective on a significant area of Church activity in Philadelphia and the East Coast that has been overshadowed by the Nauvoo experience. It is the purpose of this essay to examine these aspects of early Mormon history by focusing on Benjamin Winchester. Early Life Benjamin Winchester was born on 6 August 1817 at Lindy's Lane, Erie County, Pennsylvania. His parents, Stephen Winchester and Nancy Case Winchester, descended from New England stock.4 His father was evidently a farmer. The family converted to Mormonism in January 1833 when Benjamin was fifteen and later 2AndrewJenson, "Benjamin Winchester," LDS Biographical Encyc-lopedia, 4 vols.

Anderson, "A Fragment of Early Church History," Improvement Era 11 (March 1908): 353-58, does deal with some of Winchester's early missionary work, but it too contains historical errors. 4See New England Historical and Genealogical Register 79 (April 1925): 146-47.

Stephen Winchester remained active in the Mormon Church and died in 1873 in Salt Lake City.5 Benjamin later wrote that because of prejudice against the new church in the area, he first went only out of curiosity to hear "these distinguished emissaries of his satanic majesty." By the time of his baptism two months later, "instead of learning some new fangled doctrine, as I expected, contrary to that taught by the Savior and his apostles, I heard the very doctrine Christ com manded his disciples to go and preach."6 The Winchesters left Pennsylvania for Kirtland in November 1833.7 In May 1834, Benjamin traveled in his father's company on ^Stephen participated in Zion's Camp, then moved to northern Missouri.

Evan M. Greene's journal, Book A, LDS Church Archives, also covers this mission in great detail. On 27 January 1833, for instance, Boynton preached one and one-half hours on "the subject of the priesthood and the prosperity of the church in the Apostles day" while he himself spoke on Romans 3:1-3 (the Church coming out of the wilderness). The "Brother Winchester" mentioned in Greene's journal is Stephen Winchester, Benjamin's father. For reminiscences of this mission, but without specific references to the Winchesters, see John F.

He obtained the use of a schoolhouse to preach in and was so successful that the various ministers who argued against him only increased interest in his message. "Thus I continued laboring and making the things of God plain to their understandings," he recalled, "some weeks preaching as often as ten or eleven times."16 It was prob ably during this time that Orson Pratt joined him, and they worked together for a short time.

This call marked a turning point in his life. His successes there would both honor and plague him during the 1840s. Beginning of the Philadelphia Branch Pennsylvania had not been among the earliest or most fruitful of the Mormon mission fields. Evan M. Greene, John F. Boynton, and Philastus Hurlburt, in 1833, were apparently the first to preach in Pennsylvania, followed by Orson Pratt in 1835, Erastus Snow in 1836, and Francis G. Bishop in 1837. Winchester had also preached there, probably in 1838; but after his call in August 1839, the history of his labor is the history of the Church in Philadelphia for the next few years.24 He described the beginning of the work in Philadelphia: As soon as I had arrived here, I commenced enquiring for a house to preach in, but met with poor success the first two or three days. Indeed, I was ridiculed on almost evry [sic] occasion when I enquired for a house. (All of this in consequence of prejudice, and false reports). But my determination was still the same; and that was to proclaim the truth, to the inhabitants of this city. At length I obtained one of the commissioner's Hall's and published an appointment, in one of the news papers; and a crouded [sic] congregation attended the meeting, and I addressed the meeting, with the subject of the first principles of the gospel. I then made other appointments in the same place, and preached some 10, or 12 times and held one debate with one Dr. Bird, of the city: (a Presbyterian preacher,) which was the means of doing much good. —By this time there was quite an excitement, and the former prejudices of the people seemed to be in part removed.

It was an anti-Mormon tirade to which Winchester responded with his first published work, An Exami nation of a Lecture Delivered by the Rev. H. Perkins, probably published by the end of May. It was a point-by-point rebuttal of the Reverend's major arguments using biblical passages in defense of Mormonism. Winchester's wit and education infuse the twelve page work, and his missionary zeal is obvious in the concluding paragraph: "I am determined hereafter, that no man shall get up before a congregation in my presence, and lie so unaccountably about the truth of God; but that he shall hear of it again."38 **Biographical History of Pottawattamie County, Iowa (N.p.: Lewis Publishing Co., 1891), 543.

'^Winchester offered a biblical defense (p. 7) against Perkins's attack on this Mormon belief, which he had probably heard or heard about from Joseph Smith's public sermons in the East. Other doctrinally important pamphlets of this period include: Parley P. Pratt, The Millennium and Other Poems. . . (New York: W. Molineux, 1840), which denied the traditional Christian notion of ex nihilo creation and argued for belief in a finitistic God; Orson Pratt, Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions. . .

(Philadelphia: Brown, Bicking, and Guilbert, 1840), which asserted the LDS belief in a corporeal, anthropomorphic God.

His first project, a defense of the Book of Mormon, probably grew out of the increasing influence of the second printing of E. D. Howe's Mormonism Unvailed, first published in 1834 but reprinted in 1840 as History of Mormonism. Popular in both England and in the United States, Howe's naturalistic explanation of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon became the cornerstone of anti-Mormon writing.42 Shortly before Winchester arrived in England, Parley P. Pratt had begun publishing the IDS Millennial Star. Its effectiveness in defending the Mormon cause and commenting on its doctrines impressed Winchester, whose Origin of the Spaulding Story was a logical outcome of this influence.43 Seeing more clearly the Library-Archives; Lorenzo D. Barnes, Letter to Robinson and Smith, 8 July 1840, Philadelphia, Times and Seasons 1 (October 1840): 182; W. Smith 11:368-70; Parley P.

They arrived in Manchester on 11 August 1840 and visited Mary's friends in Manchester and Staffordshire. Winchester also went to Birmingham with John Needham and Alfred Cordon on unspecified business and was in Liverpool on 28 September, waiting to depart but had not returned to Philadelphia by 17 October.

D. Howe's affidavits, whom Winchester knew personally. Winchester's second publishing venture was a newspaper like the IDS Millennial Star. The first issue of his Gospel Reflector, the first independent, unofficial periodical published in the Church, came out on 1 January 1841, printed by the same firm that had issued his Origin of the Spaulding Story.44 In his first the Spaulding Story Concerning the Manuscript Found: With a Short Biography of D. P. Hulbert [sic], . . . (Philadelphia: Brown, Bicking, and Guilpert [sic] Printers, 1840), probably published in November or early December. The pamphlet related Winchester's conversion to Mormonism, gave a short biography of Hurlburt and his role in the origin of the Spaulding Theory, and made a case that the theory was "a base fabrication." Another edition was published by George J. Adams in Bedford, England, as Plain Facts, Shewing the Origin of Spaulding Story, Concerning the Manuscript Found, and Its Being Transformed into the Book of Mormon, with a Short History of Dr. P. Hulbert [sic] . . . (Bedford, England: C. B. Merry, 1841). In this edition the preface was reworded and signed by George J. Adams on 15 June 1841. Other alterations included the deletion of about four pages of "Reflections" on Winchester's persecutions of the Church and the addition of several pages of material on the Spaulding theory from several sources, plus one letter from Sidney Rigdon, 27 May 1839, Commerce (later Nauvoo) (which had appeared in P. P. Pratt, Plain Facts, 14-16), and a second from Orson Hyde. Hyde's letter explains: "You were advised and directed by the Conference in Bedford to re-publish an edition of a certain tract written by Benjamin Winchester. . . ."

Winchester had earlier responded to attacks by Clark in Gospel Reflector 1 (1J anuary 184l):18-20. In 1847 Dan Jones reprinted some of Winchester's pamphlet in his Welsh tract, A Review of the Lectures of the Rev. E. Roberts, as noted in Ronald D. Dennis, Welsh Mormon Writings from 1844 to 1866: A Historical Bibliography (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, Religious Studies Center, vol. 4, Specialized Monograph Series, 1988), 57-61. 44No copy of Winchester's prospectus, issued in December 1840, has been found.

Winchester planned to reprint Oliver Cowdery's letters on Church history and extracts from the Doctrine and Covenants. He also cited, not the Millennial Star, but Parley P. Pratt's Voice of Warning, an important doctrinal pamphlet first issued in 1837, as his model, and modestly said he would end the project "as soon as I publish all that I consider useful in a work of this kind."46 But when the newspaper ceased publishing in June, it was mainly because of financial problems. In fact, he told Joseph Smith in September that he had not sold enough copies "to realize any benefit from the profit of them."47 Still, the Reflector had a far-reaching impact; many of its articles were reprinted in Church periodicals in New York, Nauvoo, and Liverpool, thus reaching a large audience. Its pages also made available to East Coast mem bers items from other Church publications.48 (18) and minutes of a missionary conference held 14 December 1840 in Philadelphia describes Erastus Snow presenting "a prospectus issued by B.

Later, Winchester's essay "On Perfection" in the Gospel Reflector was reprinted</page><page sequence="17">46 Journal of Mormon History Winchester's desire to answer Mormon critics was a major motivation behind the Gospel Reflector: "As our enemies in this part of the country are engaged in spreading newspapers, pam phlets, and circulars, tracing the doctrine and characters of the above mentioned society, with the intention of stamping them with infamy and disgrace," Winchester wrote, the paper would "refute the publications that appear against us in the shape of arguments, and thus foil our enemies in their attempts."49 This helps explain the Reflector's defensive stance as well as that of Winchester's published works. Although Winchester spent much of his time for the next six months on his paper, he continued as Philadelphia Branch leader and Church defender. In February 1841, in Frankfort, Pennsylvania, he spoke on the Second Coming and the estab lishment of Christ's kingdom on earth. He then opened the in Rigdon's Messenger and Advocate of the Church of Christ (Pittsburgh) 1 (15 October 1845): 359-60. ^Gospel Reflector 1 (1 January 1841): 1-2.

The originals are in "Minutes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Philadelphia, 1840-54," holograph in RLDS Library-Archives. A letter to Winchester from Erastus Snow dated December 1840 appears just before the conference minutes. The letter, which supports the venture, and the conference minutes, appearing as they did in the first issue, undoubtedly were strategically placed to suggest to readers the local and general support of this undertaking. No doubt the Gospel Reflector and Winchester's other works in Philadelphia were in response to the same conditions Edwin D. Woolley noted in a letter dated 17 June 1841 from Pennsylvania, that non-Mormon newspapers were refusing to publish their replies and thus "leaving us but a poor opportunity to correct the errors, or refute the falsehoods, although many are calling for reply from us if they are not true." Woolley also noted that "the public prints are at war with the Kingdom." See the full letter in Times and Seasons 2 (1 September 1841): 531. For a sample of the attacks see Adrian Van Brocklin Orr, Mormonism Dissected, or Knavery "On Two Sticks," Exposed (Bethania, Penn.: Reuben Chambers, 1841).

When Winchester tried to keep the discussion on religious matters, the meeting ended in confusion. Lee printed in the Daily Chronicle (Philadelphia) a summary of his case against the Mormons. Winchester wrote a response on 19 February 1841, but the Daily Chronicle refused to print it. Consequently, Winchester published it as a paid advertisement in the Public Ledger (Philadelphia) on 23 February. In this letter, Winchester dealt with the major charges against Mormon lead ers and contributed some first-hand information relating to the Kirtland Bank.50 About this same time, problems developed in the Philadel phia Branch. The branch minutes tell of a 15 March 1841 meet ing held to resolve differences between Winchester and Almon Babbitt, without disclosing what the problems were. Further more, financial problems that continued to haunt Winchester were also emerging. On 6-7 April 1841, a special conference convened in Philadelphia to more extensively organize the Church there and to help solve its financial problems. The day before, on 5 April, the report of the financial committee, Jacob Baker, William Wharton, Jesse Price, William West, and J. B. Nicholson, revealed that as early as 1840 the branch had begun providing financial support for the presiding elder and had re newed that support after Winchester's return from England. The ^°E. G. Lee, The Mormons, or Knavery Exposed. . . (Philadelphia: n.pub., 1841), 19-21, quotes part of Winchester's letter followed by Lee's rebuttal. Lee continued to plague Mormon missionary efforts, refuted in J. L., "Anti-Mormon Slanders Refuted (From the Philadelphia Public Ledger)" Millennial Star 2 (December 1841): 115-20. Lee's arguments probably received better than average distribution because of Philadelphia's role as a port of entry and exit for the United States. See also Isaac Galland, Doctor Isaac Galland's Reply to Various Falsehoods, Misstatements and Misrepresentations, Concerning the Latter-day Saints, Reproachfully Called Mormons (Philadelphia: n.pub., 1841). In 1889, Winchester gave a negative interpretation of the Kirtland Bank in "Primitive Mormonism," Salt Lake Tribune, 22 September 1889, 2. For the broader context of the early Mormon pamphlet wars, especially in metropolitan centers, see Ellsworth, "A History of Mormon Missions," 35-50.</page><page sequence="19">48 Journal of Mormon History report documented that the branch was using almost all the money it collected just to pay for Winchester's living expenses.51 During the following conference, Hyrum Smith presided and Winchester was appointed clerk. In a reorganization, Winchester was ordained to preside over the "spiritual affairs of the church in this place," with Edison Whipple and William Wharton as his assistant counselors.52 Jacob Syfrett was called as bishop to admin ister the Church's financial affairs in the city with Jesse Price and J. B. Nicholson as his counselors. Clearly, Winchester's office was more general than that of a bishop, but it is not clear what his authority was. On 24 May 1841, Joseph Smith eliminated most of the stakes in the Church; if Winchester had been considered the equivalent of a stake president, this action would have eliminated his position. And certainly the overlapping jurisdiction caused further problems.53 Mission to Salem In the summer of 1841, Erastus Snow and Winchester filled a special mission to Salem, Massachusetts, to "try to establish the Kingdom there."54 This call proved to be a turning point in both 51"Minutes of the Church," 5 April 1841, RLDS Library-Archives. 52"Minutes of a general conference held in Philadelphia, April 6, 1841," [Benjamin Winchester, Secretary] Times and Seasons 2 (15 May 1841): 412-13; Journal History, 6 April 1841; History of the Church 4:331; Journal of History 11 (July 1918): 371-73- Isaac Galland, Letter to Joseph Smith, 15 April 1841, from Philadelphia, notes that Winchester helped him, presumably financially, during this time; see Times and Seasons 2 (1 May 1841): 399. Probably during this time, Winchester made the lengthy entry entitled "The Benefits of being safely within The Kingdom of God," in Susan H. Conrad (Wilkinson), autograph book, LDS Church Archives, and made another entry in the autograph book of Barbara Matilda Neff Moses, LDS Church Archives. ^Joseph Smith, "To the Saints Abroad," Times and Seasons 2 (1 June 1841): 434. Hyrum Smith probably intended Winchester to supervise missionary efforts while Syfrett handled the more temporal, local needs of the converts. Walter Smith, 11:373, noted that "the organization effected at this time put the work on a much firmer basis in Philadelphia, providing a permanent presidency of high priests [Winchester and counselors], and a bishop to care for the financial burdens, which had prior to this been borne by a committee of the brethren." ^Journal History, 16 August 1841; History of the Church 4:403.

Snow wrote: "In the summer of 1841, Elder Winchester and I received instructions from the First Presidency to go to Massa chusetts and open up the gospel in Salem, Boston, and that region of the country. We went together and hired the Masonic Hall in Salem and commenced preaching, but Elder Winchester very soon returned to Philadelphia, leaving me to occupy the field alone."55 Snow had accepted the mission reluctantly because he was preparing to return to Nauvoo where family and property seemed to require his immediate attention. He finally drew between lots marked "Nauvoo" and "Salem."56 Winchester, strapped by pub lishing debts and the costs of renting meeting space, also had reservations about this mission. Nevertheless, they reached Bos ton on 1 September, took the train twelve miles northeast to Salem two days later, rented a room in a boarding house for $3.50 per week, secured the Salem Masonic Hall for a public meeting, and published an eight-page pamphlet, An Address to the Citizens of Salem and Vicinity, which was reprinted twice during the next few months.57 Smith had conducted an 1836 "treasure" hunting trip there, resulting in a revelation (D&amp;C 111) directing his efforts to other "treasures in the city." It is possible that the 1841 mission call to Snow and Winchester grew out of this episode. See David R. Proper, "Joseph Smith and Salem," Essex Institute Historical Collections 100 (April 1964): 88-97; History of the Church 2:464-66; Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church 1:410-12.

Winchester had probably given Nickerson a copy as he passed through Boston. Winchester also sent Joseph Smith a copy when he wrote on 18 September, which was reprinted in the Times and Seasons 2 (15 October 1841): 574-76 and 3 (1 November [misdated on the title page as 15 November] 184l):578-84.

As late as February 1842, Snow expected him to return: "I have many calls for preaching and visiting people in all parts of the city and in the neighboring villages and need the assistance of Elder Winchester very much. "58 But Winchester had changed his mind. On 18 September he wrote to Joseph Smith, complaining of asthma attacks triggered by the New England cold, stating his understanding that the Salem call was only temporary, and expressing frustration at his printing and rental debts. He hinted broadly: "There is much printing to do in Nauvoo, and as I am somewhat acquainted with that business perhaps you could get me a situation of that kind." He also complained that Apostle John Page, then staying in Philadelphia, was pretending poverty so he would not have to accompany Orson Hyde on their assigned mission to dedicate Palestine for the return of the Jews.59 For his part, Page had doubts about Winchester's ability, which he was not hesitant to express.

For at the present time there is a feeling existing in the hearts of some concerning Elder Benjamin Winchester that I think cannot be removed better than by changing the President.... My humble opinion is that Elder Winchester has not been wise in all things as he might have been, and I presume that the members of the same branch have not looked on the course and conduct of Elder Winchester in that charitable light as they might do. Elder Winchester is very sanguine and unyielding in his course of economy concerning matters and things in the Church. There are some of the members of the same propensity and those of that first class of respectability in the branch, so I think that all that is strictly necessary to be done is that the Branch have a new President.60 Needless to say, the personal difficulties between Winchester and Page added to the growing dissension in the Philadelphia Branch. While firm evidence is lacking, it is possible that rumors of polygamy exacerbated the problems in Philadelphia. To NAUVOO In October, Winchester went to Nauvoo. He described his trip and the city in a detailed letter to Erastus Snow from Nauvoo on 12 November 1841.61 He does not, however, explain why he made the journey. On 31 October, he attended a council with the Twelve, suggesting that he was either summoned or was seeking guidance for the situation in Philadelphia. According to the min utes, Winchester "complained that he had been neglected and misrepresented by the Elders, and manifested a contentious spirit." Joseph Smith gave "him a severe reproof, telling him of his folly and vanity, and showing him that the principles which he suffered to control him would lead him to destruction." He was counseled to change his course, govern his disposition, and to quit "tale-bearing and slandering his brethren."62 Winchester's reaction to this rebuke is not known, but he apparently helped edit the Times and Seasons from November ^ohn E.

Although there is no mention in the Times and Seasons of Winchester's connection with it, he recalled in 1889 that for a short time after the death of Don Carlos Smith, Joseph's brother and editor until his death in August 1841, he helped edit the paper; furthermore, the paper reprinted a total of eight of Winchester's articles from the Gospel Reflector; six ap peared, one per issue, between 1 December 1841 and 15 February 1842.63 Gustavus Hills was appointed assistant editor in mid-Janu ary 1842, probably ending any professional hopes Winchester may have had there.64 Beginning in the fall of 1841, the Quorum of the Twelve had received enlarged administrative responsibili ties, and making the Times and Seasons a more official organ was part of a larger pattern. Brigham Young acted as the Church's agent in Robinson's not entirely voluntary sale of the newspaper to the Church in February 1842.65 This growing centralization of power may have been a source of further discontent for Winchester and contributed to his later backbiting against the Twelve and complaints about the situation in Pennsylvania.

Joseph Smith's appended note said this request would be discussed at April conference in Nauvoo. The petition's first signer, Richard Savary, had sent a personal letter to Joseph Smith, 2 February 1842, thanking Page for convincing him of his errors, "relative to the divinity of the Bible."71 The conflict intensified in early April when Winchester insisted on moving the meetings to the Assembly Building on the southwest corner of Tenth and Chestnut streets in the southern part of the city.72 The Marshall Institute hall was in the northern part. This decision may reflect either a need for more space or an attempt to put some space between him and John Page. At least some of the Saints, presum ably under Page's leadership, had held meetings there as early as January 1842. The conference, held on Chestnut Street, approved the decision but not unanimously.73 On 22 April a petition against the move signed by seventy-one was on its way to Nauvoo, asking in strong terms "that a church may be organized in the north part of the city of Philadelphia (in the part of the city where most of us reside) separate and distinct from any others."74 On 14 May 1842 Joseph Smith granted this petition, "and my doings were sanctioned by the Twelve who at the same time silenced Elder Benjamin Winchester for not following counsel."75 Meetings were therefore held in both locations, a de facto split of the branch, from April until September. The disciplinary action may not reflect personal dislike or opposition to Winches ter as much as the political reality that Page was an apostle and the Quorum of the Twelve was continuing to receive and consoli date its power.

Adams, a popular convert, actor, and powerful debater, where they held a two-week "public discussion" with Reverend George Montgomery West.77 Winchester was restored "to his former fellowship and standing in the Church" in July but warned to relocate immediately and promised, "Then it will be well with him, if he will be faithful and true to the great cause."78 But Winchester stayed in the Philadelphia area, an action which led him into greater difficulties with Church leaders. On 14 September Winchester's first counselor, Edison Whipple, resigned to move to Nauvoo.79 Leadership was in dis array given Page's presence but lack of local office, the exist ing bishopric, the first-silenced, then-restored Winchester, who was instructed to leave the city.

Second, he denied John C. Bennett's claims that the Mormons were "sanctioning a community of wives, "82 a stand that must have mortified him when he learned the facts first-hand. Third, the Clipper reporter added that Winchester would deliver a series of lectures in a few weeks, suggesting that the move was quasi-permanent. The lecture also impressed the reporter, who stated, "We confess that Mr. Winchester changed our opinion of the sect." John Taylor, editor of the Times and Seasons, com mented positively on Winchester's contribution to missionary work when he reprinted the article and, at Hyrum Smith's request, printed a notice about Winchester's Synopsis of the Holy Scrip tures, noting that "it does credit to its author." Unfortunately, Winchester returned to Philadelphia before the year ended where, once again, trouble erupted. In the summer he published a 168-page History of the Priesthood,83 a mission 8^'Mormons, or Latter Day Saints," [From the Baltimore (Upper], Times and Seasons 4 (1 December 1842): 27-28. 82John Cook Bennett was a man of varied talents, many of which he used to the Church's benefit during the Nauvoo period. He was especially important in securing the charter for the city of Nauvoo. He was rewarded for these efforts by being elected the first Mayor of Nauvoo. His influence on Joseph Smith appears to have been great, but he eventually lost his standing through his immorality. He was excommunicated in May 1842. His influence as an enemy of the Church was considerable, mainly through his book The History of the Saints; or an Expose of Joe Smith and the Mormons (Boston: Leland and Whiting, 1842). The book appeared in late September or early October 1842. His attacks on Mormonism were extensive, some of which were echoed by Thomas Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal, a vehement anti-Mormon newspaper in Illinois. Pages 217-57 contain the charges, with many examples, of polygamy among the Mormons. It was these allegations, more than anything else, that caused the Mormon missionaries such problems in the field, and it was to these charges that Winchester addressed himself. For a summary of Bennett's association with the Church, see Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church 2:47-50, 140-47; and more recently, Danel Bachman, "A Study of the Mormon Practice of Plural Marriage Before the Death of Joseph Smith," (M.A. thesis, Purdue University, 1975), 218-60. 8^4 History of the Priesthood from the Beginning of the World to the Present Time Written in Defense of the Doctrine and Position of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and also a Brief Treatise Upon the</page><page sequence="28">David J. whittaker/Benjamin Winchester 57 ary-oriented work that included detailed scriptural commentary and reworkings of some essays published in the Gospel Reflector. It presents concisely the main arguments of the early Church about the historicity of God's delegation of priesthood power and the existence of priesthood authority as a sign of the true church.84 Winchester interpreted priesthood as a spiritual, not temporal, power. This view is in keeping with his philosophy, argued as early as April 1841, that Mormonism was a spiritual, not a political, force.85 This view was increasingly at odds with devel opments at Nauvoo. It is difficult to reconstruct fully what happened next, but on 16 February 1843, Peter Hess wrote Hyrum Smith an overview of the Philadelphia difficulties as he saw them. Hess reviewed the events of the October conference, describing increasing disagree ments between George J. Adams and Winchester over Winches ter's continued insistence on dealing harshly with "refractory" members who had been meeting at the Marshall Institute. Thus, he felt that the conference had failed to support Winchester's leadership between April and October. Winchester also made numerous charges of adultery, which later turned into accusations of polygamy and spread to include members in Boston and New York. Hess had opposed these recommendations, recalling that Hyrum Smith had counseled "mildness" in dealing with transgres sors. Hess described members who had sustained him in his office Fundamental Sentiments, Particularly Those Which Distinguish the Above Society from Others Now Extant (Philadelphia: Brown, Bicking, andGuilbert, 1843). The copy in LDS Church Archives was owned by Joseph F. Smith, who seems to have used it throughout his life. ^Winchester's was the first volume-length study to appear on the priesthood. John Taylor's The Government of God (1852) was less historical and more focused on the practical and theoretical application of priesthood. It was as if he was building upon the historical foundation laid by Winchester nine years before, although Taylor advocated the literal establishment of the kingdom of God, while Winchester discussed only its spiritual and scriptural dimensions. 85Benjamin Winchester, "Nebuchadnezzar's Dream," Gospel Reflector 1 (1 April 1841): 192-200; and ibid. 1 (15 April 1841): 201-13- This was reprinted in the Times and Seasons 3 (1 December 1841): 607-14.

Adams had helped keep order; but after he left for Boston, a "secret spring" arose to challenge Adams's authority and to subvert his leadership, when Adams had been elected to preside at a conference in Philadelphia. Hess was convinced that if this "spring" could be removed, the Church would acquire "multitudes and multitudes." This "secret spring," Hess claimed, was absent from most all Church meetings, except he always managed to "thrust himself in where he is not wanted." Lest his metaphor had been too obscure, Hess wrote a postscript to Joseph Smith: "Brother Joseph in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Call home this secret spring. The two first letters of his name is [sic] Benjamin Winchester."86 Hess mentioned that other letters would confirm these facts. Although none seem extant, these Philadelphia reports were apparently on the agenda of a meeting with Joseph Smith and several apostles on 19 April 1843. Joseph commented, "You can never make anything out of Benjamin Winchester if you take him out of the channel he wants to be in. "87 Meanwhile, before Church leaders could send instructions to Philadelphia, a special meeting was convened there on 21 April at Winchester's request to pro vide a forum in which to "set forth the difficulties that existed between Elder Hess and himself." The clerk, J. B. Nicholson, a councilor in the Philadelphia bishopric, was the son of a woman Winchester had apparently accused of immorality, which may account for a certain bias in the minutes.88 It is clear that Winchester was again out of favor with the Philadelphia leaders, but the exact problem is not clear. The complaints against him include Nicholson's accusation that Win chester had been spreading remarks that were "slandering" his mother, who lived in New York. George J. Adams, back from Boston, agreed with others that Winchester was guilty of "back 8%&gt;eter Hess, Letter to Hyrum Smith, 16 February 1843; Hyrum Smith Collection, LDS Church Archives. 87Journal History, 19 April 1843; History of the Church 5:367. 88"A Council Meeting of the Official Members of the Church ... in Philadelphia," LDS Church Archives; typescript in my possession.</page><page sequence="30">David J.

The witnesses against him failed to give any information that was not hearsay, Winches ter strongly denied all charges, and the meeting adjourned to the next day in "some little confusion." No record of a second meeting exists, and both women wrote to Joseph Smith in May "complain ing of the slanderous conduct of Benjamin Winchester." Joseph Smith immediately directed the Twelve to act upon the matter,89 then met with the apostles, Adams, and Winchester five days later on 27 May to investigate Winchester's conduct. Trial in Nauvoo About two months after the investigations in Nauvoo, Adams wrote to Peter Hess: "Winchester was entirely used up by Bro. Joseph and Bro. Young before the council of the Twelve and his license [was] taken from him. It was his last kick until he reformed. I never heard a man get such a scoring since the Lord made me as Winchester got at that time."90 According to Wilford Woodruffs journal, Joseph Smith used Winchester's trial to instruct the apostles further in their areas of jurisdiction and responsibility.91 The charges against Winchester were "improper conduct, slandering the Saints in Philadelphia, for rejecting the counsel of Hyrum, Joseph and the Twelve, and tearing to pieces the Saints instead of building them up." During the proceedings Winchester was "refractory and out of order."92 The group heard several letters read, including Sybbella Armstrong's complaint, then Winchester made a lengthy speech justifying himself.

At this point, Joseph Smith stood up and "rebuked Elder Winchester in the sharpest manner; said he had a lying spirit and had lied about him, and told him of his many errors." Brigham Young, president of the Twelve, said that he had "made his mind up and that his decision was that Winchester should give up his license and cease preaching until he should reform." Hyrum Smith, who had made several pleas for mercy, now pointed out that Winchester had not yet had a chance to get witnesses for his side. After Winchester had asked for time to investigate the merits of Armstrong's letter, of which he had just learned the contents, Young suggested that the Nauvoo high council hear the matter. Joseph Smith instructed the Twelve that they were "to regulate the churches and elders abroad in all the world" while the high council concerned itself only with Nauvoo.93 Hyrum still insisted that the trial be put off until the next day, but Young chastised Winchester severely. Apparently Winchester had been arguing that the Twelve had no authority over him in Philadelphia, but Young wished to make their jurisdiction plain. Winchester's later decision to work against Brigham Young as Joseph Smith's successor probably dates from this tongue-lashing. Joseph Smith then counseled that Winchester be silenced and that his license for preaching be taken from him, that he and his family move to Nauvoo, "and if he would not do that, let him go out of the church." The body unanimously accepted this counsel, and Winchester agreed not to preach. Joseph Smith then gave the Twelve further instructions on conducting an ecclesiastical court and, presumably using Winchester as an example, told the apos tles that their most important responsibility was to "discern the ^Joseph Smith's directive altered his 2 May 1835 directive forbidding the Twelve to become involved in local Church affairs in Missouri.

Because contradictory statements had been made, he further instructed the Twelve to thoroughly investigate the church in Philadelphia.94 Two days later, the Twelve sent a special message to the Saints in Philadel phia, counseling in the strongest terms that these members gather without delay to Nauvoo.95 Winchester obediently went back to Philadelphia and pre pared to move his family to Nauvoo. We have little information on his activities during this period, but Brigham Young traveled with Winchester and Heber C. Kimball in the Philadelphia area in August 1843,96 and he became involved with personal conflicts Apostle William Smith was having in New Jersey in the fall of 1843 According to a pamphlet Smith published in early 1844, Winches ter told Smith that Abraham Burtis, the presiding elder in the branch at New Egypt, New Jersey, was planning to sue Smith for defamation of character, claiming that Smith had forged a letter purporting to be from a Dr. Lee that slandered his wife's morals. Smith gave Winchester Lee's letter, which convinced Burtis that the letter was valid. At a special conference on 18 October 1843 at New Egypt, Burtis was excommunicated for rejecting the authority of the Church, for circulating slanderous reports, and for unchristian-like conduct. Winchester's vote was negative, suggesting either hurt feelings about his own May trial in Nauvoo or possibly stronger ties to Burtis. Winchester had opened this area of New Jersey to missionary work in 1838, and Burtis may have been one of his converts. William Smith calls Burtis "a particular favorite of Bros. Winchester and [E.] Snow."97 94History of the Church 5:412.

In Nauvoo It is not clear how Winchester earned his living, but there is no immediate hint of dissatisfaction. He ran errands for Joseph Smith and helped form the Nauvoo Library and Literary Institute, contributing more books than anyone but Joseph Smith and Jeremiah Hatch, Jr. He was elected its first president, and the minutes record a lively address he gave urging the establishment of its library "in a very energetic and conclusive manner." He assured the group "that wealthy dignity nor fame was power but intelligence was power, for that alone could perpetuate our free institutions, for it was necessary in the tribunals of Justice, it was of the utmost importance in the halls of Legislation and above all most important in the sacred task."98 On 28 November 1843, he was one of 3,419 who signed the "Scroll Petition" for redress because of losses in Missouri."

Many individuals close to Joseph had questioned the growing secularism of his administration months before his death. Joseph Smith's involvement in land speculation, city government, military affairs, and even the quest for the American Presidency seemed evidence that the Church was be coming too worldly. Brigham Young, because of his position as leader of the powerful Quorum of the Twelve, established his claim as the rightful successor.

His reasons for doing so were mixed. In 1889 he recalled the growing secularism of the Church, the doctrine of plural marriage, and his dislike of William Smith as motives. Certainly Young's semi-public tongue lashing did not endear him to Winchester. However, for Winches ter, the succession crisis had begun before 1844. By moving to Nauvoo, Winchester had become aware of the then-secret practice of plural marriage. It is not known if plural marriage was actually being practiced as early as 1843 in Philadel phia, though Parley P. Pratt says Joseph Smith taught him and others in 1840 in Philadelphia the concepts of "eternal family organization, and the eternal union of the sexes."104 During the winter of 1843-44, Winchester later recalled, Hyrum Smith, "who had always been a particular friend," attempted to explain the doctrine to him. When Winchester refused to believe that the practice was anything more than satanic, Joseph Smith sum moned him and "explained it in as plausible a manner as he could and requested [him] to take a mission and go to the Southern cities saying that it was the command of the Lord."105 Although Winchester suggests that he was introduced to polygamy by the Smith brothers, rumors of the practice (and denials of it) had circulated since John C. Bennett had been excommunicated the year before. According to Winchester fam ily descendants, Winchester's parents had sheltered Joseph Smith when he was pursued by bounty hunters. There is a strong possibility that Joseph Smith married Benjamin's sixteen-year-old sister, Nancy Mariah, in late 1843 or in early 1844. She was sealed vicariously to Joseph Smith on 3 February 1846 and to Heber C. Kimball for time.106 Benjamin's repugnance for polygamy, ex ^Autobiography of Parley P.

These developments help explain Winchester's actions and place his personal trials in the larger context of Church growth, both doctrinally and ecclesiastically. He was clearly on a collision course with the men who would become leaders of the Church after Joseph's death. Initially, Winchester did not publicly take sides in the lead ership controversy. In fact, he was probably not in Nauvoo for the final contest between Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon on 8 August 1844, since The Prophet in New York published a warm notice: Elder Bing.

She was endowed in December 1845; she married Amos George Arnold, apparently at Kimball's request because of her desire to bear children, on 12 October 1865 and on 9 December 1867 gave birth to George Stephen Arnold.

Winchester was not involved with Rigdon's losing strug gle with the Twelve nor his excommunication in September 1844.109 In fact, it was not until Rigdon had launched an attack on the Twelve, their secular interests, and polygamy that he allied himself to Rigdon's cause, and then only briefly. Winchester attended a conference in Philadelphia on 31 August and 1 September 1844 in which William Smith reproved Winchester for his past actions.110 Winchester, possibly still smart ing over the Burtis episode, arose and expressed his candid feelings toward the Twelve. Among other things he accused the Twelve of slandering him, of forcing him to spend over four hundred dollars in going to and returning from Nauvoo the previous year, and of never explaining the reason why he had been suspended. For these reasons he stated that he would neither sustain the authorities in Nauvoo nor "go out to preach the gospel."

Grant, who had attended the conference, reported the conference to Brigham Young, adding that Winchester had turned against the Twelve because they had fought against him and his attacks on the "spiritual wife system." According to Grant, Winchester was traveling from house to house in Philadelphia, stirring up conversations about polygamy, while refusing to preach because he did not want to bring any female to her ruin, as he claimed other missionaries had.112 William Smith followed it up with a letter from New York urging Young to take immediate action, for Winchester "has taken a stand that will tend materially to the injury of the Cause in the East." He was drawing to him "a number of 'discontented' spirits" who were using their influence against the Twelve.113 On 25 September William A. Moon, a British convert, elder, and friend of Brigham Young, wrote Young a third report of Winchester's activities in Philadelphia: We . . . found the Saints in a very excited state in consequence of the course pursued by Elder Benj.

Winchester had evidently taken orders for some of his books as he passed through New York on his way to Philadelphia. This notice suggests his works were still sought after and not yet banned.

He charged them with living in open adultery and says that they not only believe but practice polygamy. I asked him privately for his opinion of Joseph at the time he fell.

Moon concluded that Winchester had "become disaffected with the Twelve and has sought in their absence in this underhanded way to vent his spleen and blast their characters and influence for the sake of revenge."114 Winchester's success in Philadelphia (the branch now num bered 334) and long ecclesiastical care of its members may have made him feel responsible for undeceiving them, as he interpreted it. Regardless of his motives, he proved to be a threat to the leaders in Nauvoo. Even before Brigham Young received Moon's letter, he convened a Church court on 26 September. Benjamin and Mary Winchester were excommunicated; Benjamin, in part, for "un christian like conduct" and "slandering the Church," and "railing against, and speaking evil of the Twelve and others."

Adams warned the Church in the East against Winchester, but called Winchester "this giant of an Anti-Mormon," insisted his disobedience had begun in 1840 when Joseph Smith visited the Philadelphia conference (the date when Parley P. Pratt said he first learned about celestial marriage), claimed that Joseph and Hyrum Smith just before their martyrdom had said Winchester "was rotten at heart, would apostatize, and injure the church as much as he could," and accused him of staying with the Church as long as he did so that he could "dispose of a lot of old books he had on hand."117 Such vituperation suggests that Winchester had begun to include Adams in his public charges of immorality. Winchester must have replied, though it has not been preserved, for Adams sued Winchester for slander in November.118 Also on 12 October, Winchester conducted a conference in Pittsburgh "to distinctly ascertain the minds of the members of the church in this place, relative to the heretical doctrines taught and practiced in Nauvoo, by the Quorum of the Twelve and some of their associates, and also the claims of S. Rigdon."119 After 116«October Conference Minutes," Times and Seasons 5(15 October 1844): 682-84; B. H. Roberts identifies Winchester as one of those whom Young was talking about.

According to William Smith, Winchester was under a $2,500 bond by 1 November. 11^The minutes of this conference were published in the first issue of Sidney</page><page sequence="41">70 Journal of Mormon History several speeches, the conference voted to send four messengers to the eastern branches to "set before them the true state of the church." Winchester, one of the four, issued on 15 October a general letter to "all the members," arguing the validity of Sidney Rigdon's claims to leadership and denouncing the Twelve whom, he claimed, feared that Rigdon would bring them to "an account, or in other words, to justice for teaching and practicing the doctrine of polygamy." Winchester promised "to publish, as soon as possible, a work in which I shall cancel [sic] the claims of Elder Rigdon at length, and expose the advocates of the 'Spiritual Wife System' by referring you to facts and evidence of the most un doubted authority."120 The promised work never appeared, probably because Win chester soon grew disillusioned with the Rigdon faction. Several of his Pennsylvania converts followed him to Rigdon's camp, and Winchester seems to have contributed his preaching abilities to the initial thrust of Rigdon's group. However, he remained only long enough to vent his dislike of polygamy. William Smith visited Philadelphia in late October and, irri tated by Winchester's preaching, composed a letter that must rank as one of the most libelous in the early Church. He accused Winchester of being a "wanton falsifier and base calumniator," who, although he has not "stole a horse, or slept with bad women," has done far worse, and concluded with a charge that Winchester "was more or less engaged in Law infraction at Nau voo."121 This statement was tantamount to accusing him of plot ting Joseph's death; and Winchester, who had been in the South Rigdon's Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate (Pittsburgh) 1 (15 October 1844): 11-12. 120Winchester, "To All the Members of the Church...LDS Messenger and Advocate 1 (15 October 1844): 14-15.

Grant in Philadelphia and Samuel Brannan in New York for circulating and selling The Prophet, which published Smith's letter.122 William Smith, who was facing a prison term if he was found guilty, wrote at least twice to Brigham Young trying to find evidence to substantiate his charges he had made against Win chester. The first letter asserted that his article was published to defend "myself and our cause." He sent Young a copy of his published letter and insisted that there was evidence that Win chester was involved in a house-to-house "pettifogging" of the Twelve and Joseph Smith just before the latter's death. He then requested Young "to learn what the Bretherin [sic] know of this subject and put it into the form of affidavits and send [them] to New York."123 Two days after Smith wrote to Brigham Young, he "cor rected" his charges, insisting that his original statement had been misprinted, claiming that he said he believed Winchester had been engaged with the William and Wilson Law faction who had published the Nauvoo Expositor and then apologizing: "A small mistake sometimes makes trouble and it is not my intention to charge any person wrongfully."124 This suit was still pending in March 1845 when William Smith again wrote to Brigham Young, asserting that he was the main target of Rigdonism because he was the "principle [sic] means of Saving the Eastern Churches." Winchester had an "apostate spirit" and Smith needed help from Nauvoo or otherwise he would go to prison for "telling the truth about B. Winchester."125 122Notice, [Samuel Brannan], The Prophet 1 (23 December 1844): 2.

Further, William Smith was sending missionaries out to collect money to help pay for his lawsuits. However, in spite of the "Winchester friction," Elder Jedediah M.

After that point, Rigdon and Winchester concentrated their efforts in Pennsylvania where both he and Winchester had numerous contacts. Approxi mately 40 percent of the Philadelphia Branch were excommuni cated between September 1844 and 1847, most for rejecting apostolic succession. A number of Philadelphia converts signed a broadside publicly supporting Sidney Rigdon, then also gave their support to James J. Strang, and finally rejected him as his own polygamy became public.131 In December William Smith belittled Winchester for say ing he supported Rigdon because Rigdon "advocates the prin ciples of virtue and righteousness," then editorialized on the faults of both men in such a way as to encourage a split be tween them.132 In early 1845, Rigdon's supporters published an editorial commending Winchester for his courage in stand ing up to Smith's attacks.133 Meanwhile, Parley P. Pratt took over The Prophet and issued strict guidelines for publishing. His main concerns were with those works which were often erroneous and wasteful of money needed for the temple. To bring some order to the print chaos, only those authorized by the Twelve were to be in the publishing business, and only Nauvoo, Liverpool, and New York were authorized as "empo riums of light, truth and news."134 Pratt specifically banned Prophet 1 (16 November 1844): 2.

This ban acknowledged the influence of Winchester's books in the East and struck directly at an im portant source of income for Winchester. (Pratt also partially supported himself through his publications.) Winchester's works were advertised in Rigdon's newspaper throughout 1845; and acting as a "traveling agent" for the new LDS Mes senger and Advocate, Winchester managed to make a little money.135 But he was forced into other employment by the end of 1845. In early April Rigdon held his organizational conference in Pittsburgh. Winchester, among those listed as "absentee," was named an apostle in the new church.136 When Nauvoo rumored that Winchester was no longer supporting Rigdon, Winchester immediately penned a letter saying that he remained convinced that "if there is any truth in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants; the friends of Elder Rigdon have the whole of that truth."137 In July Winchester wrote a report of successful proselyting meetings on Rigdon's behalf in Philadel phia,138 but apparently his second thoughts about Rigdon began that month.

This establishment of a temporal kingdom, combined with other doubts, surely pushed Winchester to re consider his commitments. The minutes of Rigdon's 6-8 October conference in Philadelphia reveal Winchester's growing disillu sionment.141 By 9 December 1845, Rigdon's grand council was hearing charges of transgression against Winchester and Richard Savary; while procedural problems prevented specific action, by 13 December Winchester had withdrawn from the Rig donites.142 The twenty-eight-year-old Winchester must also have faced serious questions about providing for his growing family.

One of the last references to him in a Church periodical occurred when George B. Wallace, an early East Coast convert and later president of the Salt Lake Stake, said Winchester told him in November 1845 that "if it had not been for William Smith, he should have been in the church to this day."144 Samuel Brannan commented in February 1846 that he "should not be sur prised" if Winchester "crossed the mountains with the Saints."145 In October 1850 Winchester's old friend, Erastus Snow, visited him. "He had lost the spirit of the fullness of the gospel and his mind was very dark," wrote Snow, "yet he received me very gladly and listened very attentively to my council and exhortation.

Council Bluffs, situated on its west ern edge, was an outfitting point for western travelers with a population of about 1,500. Winchester became a successful brickmaker, greatly aided by a fire that had destroyed half the town in October 1853 with a second fire in 1854 demolishing the newly built wooden replace ments. Brick was thus a popular building material, and Winchester retained this profession for the rest of his working life. It is not known where he learned this trade.148 His first business contract, in the summer of 1854, was mostly in Omaha, Nebraska, just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs. Also in 1854, the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company, which wanted the territorial capitol in Omaha, em ployed Winchester "to make brick for a building which was to be offered to the authorities for a capitol.... In a short time [he] had several thousand brick set in a kiln ready for burning. [But] lacking lumber for shed to protect the kiln from the weather he covered it with canvas.

He served two years as a city councilman and ran unsuccessfully in the 1850s for the state legislature.152 The Democrats were the minority party; but in 1856 he told Frank lin D. Richards at Florence, Nebraska, that he lost partly be cause it came out during the election that he was a Mor mon.153 Iowa had particular reasons for anti-Mormon senti ment. In 1848 the Mormon vote in Kanesville (Council Bluffs) had been challenged; and Lysander W. Babbitt, editor of the Council Bluffs Bugle, nominated on the Democratic ticket for lieutenant governor in 1856, had to defend himself against charges of being a Mormon.154 Various Mormon off-shoots also settled in Iowa in the 1850s, although they usually had amica ble relations with their neighbors.155 151History and Directory of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, 1880-1881 (n.p., n.d.), 155, 393- Early business and residential directories at the Council Bluffs Public Library contain information on Winchester's business activities and, occasionally, biographical information. 152Biographical History of Pottawattamie County (1891), 543; Horace E.

Whittaker/Benjamin Winchester 81 Information on the remainder of Winchester's life is sketchy. The Zion's Camp roll of 12 October 1864 notes that Benjamin Winchester had become a "spiritualist"; and Winchester, on a trip to Salt Lake City in 1871, perhaps to visit his father, called on Amasa Lyman, an apostle excommunicated, among other things, for spiritualism. Winchester retired in 1887, wrote a biographical sketch two years later for the Salt Lake Tribune, died at Council Bluffs on 25 January 1901, and was buried in its Walnut Hills Cemetery.156 Conclusion Winchester's early life and contributions to the early Mor mon Church are the story of attraction to a dynamic system upon which he lavished the creative energy of his young manhood. In his 1889 recollections, he calls that relationship with the toler ance of a man remembering youthful enthusiasms: "I was young, and like many other youthful religious enthusiasts I was induced to believe that many things which seem[ed] to be wrong and absurd would come out right, and with many misgivings about what seemed to me foolish and absurd, I kept on hoping that the 155Charles Blancer Thompson moved his group of followers, Jehovah's Presbytery of Zion, to Monoma County in the 1850s and made a communal settlement called Preparation. In October 1858, Thompson's disgruntled followers chased him out of the town. Dale Morgan, "A Bibliography of the Dispersion," 114-15; Constant R. Marks, "Monoma County Mormons," Annals of Iowa, 3rd series, 7 (April 1906): 321-46. Francis Gladden Bishop led another group of former Mormons to the Little Sioux River in 1854. Alpheus Cutler started the westward trek but tarried in Fremont County where, in September 1853, he organized his own church. Several groups claimed loyalty to Sidney Rigdon, and Daryl Chase, "Sidney Rigdon—Early Mormon Leader" (M.A. thesis, University of Chicago, 1931), 156, suggests Rigdon sent colonies to Iowa in 1854. Van Wagoner, Sidney Rigdon, 417-20, shows that Rigdon sent colonists to Attica, Iowa, in 1865 as a place of refuge for his followers. No information has been found to suggest that Winchester's move in 1854 was more than coincidence. 15^"Zion's Camp Folder," [compiled by Thomas Bullock], LDS Church Archives; Amasa M.

Time dulled and even deadened the enthusiasm that had once motivated and inspired him. On another level, without knowing it, he became fixed on (and against) particular doctrines and practices, unable to evolve at the same speed the Church was changing.158 Faced with the reality of polygamy, a growing tem poral kingdom, and the concentration of authority, Winchester had to make agonizing decisions that, in the end, severed him from the very organization that had given focus and meaning to his life. Winchester's life provides a good case study of the early freelance missionary who survived at first by individualism and strong will. Such leaders were essential to the early survival of the Church. But when the growing organization moved through the stage of centralized power, they were unable to adjust. Winches ter argued that the Church's new authoritarianism was wrong, but his very success as a missionary and writer had helped create the need for increased structure to fellowship, gather, and communi cate with those who had received his message of salvation. He was, then, both an innocent victim and a guilty participant in the process of creating a system that both attracted and repelled his loyalties. Winchester's story also suggests important areas for future investigation. First, we are accustomed to telling the story of the Church in terms of Kirtland, Missouri, and Nauvoo. However, the Philadelphia branch identifies the importance of early Mormon urban history and suggests the importance of investigating New York and Boston as well.159 Much more work needs to be done '^Winchester, "Primitive Mormonism." For an analysis of parallel early nineteenth-century Christian attitudes, see Nathan O. Hatch, "The Christian Movement and the Demand for a Theology of the People, "Journal of American History 67 (December 1980): 545-67; Nathan O. Hatch, The Democratization of American Christianity (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1989); and David J. Whittaker, "The Book of Daniel." 158See Leonard J.

Second, the whole spectrum of the early Mormon mind needs further investigation, especially through the unofficial press and those individuals who contributed the hundreds of tracts, broadsides, almanacs, hymnals, books, and pamphlets to the early Church. Who wrote what and why, and who read what? Parley Pratt's January 1845 attempt to regulate publishing in the Church suggests the key role of the press in the succession crisis. Third, the progress and development of Church organization and doctrine were complex forces that produced predictable stresses on early defenders of the faith. The often unpublicized changes in early Church organization were bound to create dilem mas for leaders far removed from Church headquarters. Commu nication difficulties compounded the problem, as did strong and, in a few cases, flawed personalities. Benjamin Winchester made a number of choices at turning points; but he was also something of a victim of nineteenth-century forces. As a result, this devoted missionary, gifted writer, and energetic leader became someone marked forever by the Church, yet forgotten by it.
