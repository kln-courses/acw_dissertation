<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES THE BREAKING OF THE HEIFER'S NECK by Alexander Roifer {pp. 119-143) In this article an attempt is made to discover the primary form and intention of the rite described in Deut xxi, 1-9 and the stages of development preceding its final integration among the laws in Deuteronomy. To this end complementary material is cited from early rabbinic tradition, possible parallels from the ancient east are examined and the various views propounded hitherto by scholars surveyed. The first conclusion to emerge is that no real connection can be traced between the rite of the יegla 'arufa and ancient arab customs, laws in the Hamurabi codex, Nuzu procedures or the Ugaritic records, which were published in Palais royal d'Ugarit IV. This is chiefly because all these documents are concerned with the settling of relations (mainly compensation) between the relations of the victim and the perpetrators of the crime. In Deut xxi 1-9, on the other hand, no relatives of the victim appear. The dead man is depicted in Jewish law as a solitary person with no kin, the purpose of the rite being purely sacral. A comparison of Hittite law (section 6 in both versions) with the rite of cegla c arufa as formulated in the Pentateuch and Mishna (Sota ix) indicates that a common prin ciple exists: the corpse found in the field deprives the living of the right to the field in question. In accordance with this an attempt has been made to reconstruct an archaic law common to and preceding both cultures: The discovery of the body of a (murdered) person defiles the land on which it was lying and it was forbidden to work this land in any way. In the case of the Hittites this sacral ordinance underwent a secular, civil development — the defiled field became an object of compensation. This trans formation is completely in line with what we know of the course of development fol lowed by Hittite laws. In the case of Israel the sacral concepts did not disappear but were adjusted to the new faith. The concept of the national inheritance connected with that of the covenant with the Lord necessitated the banishing of the defilement into the wilderness. This was achieved through a symbolic repetition of the deed of murder in "a rough valley". An internal analysis of the paragraph in Deut xxi 1-9 indicates that this transition took place much earlier than the composition of the book of Deuteronomy. THE BOOK OF ESTHER IN THE LIGHT OF THE STORY OF JOSEPH IN EGYPT by Moshe Gan {pp. 144-149) An analysis of the book of Esther from the aspect of background, personality of the heroes and their development, the chain of events and various motives as com pared with the story of Joseph's experiences in Egypt related in the book of Genesis (particularly chaps xxxix-xli) leads to the recognition that the author of the book of Esther drew his inspiration, to a decisive extent, from the story of Joseph and built his story on the same plan. This realisation is strengthened by the existence of unmistakeable linguistic influences indicated in the author's employment in the book of Esther of figures of speech and stylistic formulae borrowed from the Joseph story.</page><page sequence="2">II SUMMARIES 1. The setting is similar: a foreign royal house in a foreign country, the heroes (Joseph and his counterpart Mordecai and Esther) Israelites who achieve high position, for the purpose of rescuing their people from misfortune. 2. The heroes' stages of development are parallel: in both cases the heroes (Joseph and Esther) came to the fore on account of their external appearance, their beauty; both experience a period of obscurity and decline and are given opportunities for the expression of their personal qualities; in both cases wisdom and prudence are com bined with moral fibre (Joseph interpreted the dreams of the eunuchs, Mordecai ex posed the designs of the eunuchs); in both stories there are two eunuchs who sinned against the king; but the heroes remain forgotten in spite of the confirmation of their discoveries. At the same time, their coreligionists suffer misfortune and their lives are in danger (the famine, Haman's decree). 3. In the working out of the events the parallel continues: the turning point comes at night. The royal slumber is disturbed (Pharaoh through his dreams, Ahasuerus through insomnia) and the solution comes about through the remembrance of the heroes (Joseph and Mordecai); they achieve greatness through the kings investing them with authority and honour as a reward for their deeds; the entrusting of the royal ring to their hands, the riding through the streets of the city in royal apparel and chariot accompanied by a special proclamation of their distinction. The two stories contain other parallel motives. 4. The linguistic influence is indicated chiefly in the use by the author of the book of Esther of expressions and figures of speech that only appear in the story of Joseph. Here are some of them: a) "for so are fulfilled that days of those who are embalmed" (Gen i, 3) "for so are fulfilled the days of their anointing" (Esther ii, 12) b) "And it came to pass when she spoke to Joseph day by day and he did not listen to her" (Gen xxxix 10) "And it came to pass when they spoke daily unto him and he did not listen to them" (Esther iii 4) c) Consecutive appearance of parallel introductory formula in corresponding groups of verses in both stories: "let the king appoint officers . . over "let Pharaoh . .. appoint officers over all the countries of his kingdom" the land ..." "let every young virgin of goodly ap- "let all the food of the good years pearance be gathered." be gathered." "And the matter was pleasing in the "And the matter was pleasing in the eyes of the king." eyes of Pharaoh." (Esther ii, 3-4) (Gen xli, 34-37) d) The verbs describing the bestowing of royal honours are identical: Gen. xli 42-43 wayyasar ("and he took off") wayyitten 01 נa ("and he put it") wayyalbesh ("and he clothed1') wayyarkev ("and he caused him to ride") wayyiqre'u lefanaw ("and they cried before him") Esther viii 2, 7 wayyasar ("and he took off,/) wayyittenah ("and he put it") wayyalbesh ("and he clothed") wayyarkivehu ("and he caused him to ride") wayyiqra lefanaw ("and he cried before him")</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES III MATTHEW XVII, 24-27 AND THE DEAD SEA SECT by David Flusser {pp. 150-156) The usual explanation of Matth, xvii 24-27 is that the narrative originated in the early Jerusalem Church and that its tendency is to point out that the Christians, being the sons of God, are not obliged to pay the Temple Tax, whereas the Jews, being strangers to God, are obliged to pay the tax. This usual view about the passage in Matthew is difficult to accept. It seems thaf the meaning of the passage is that the Temple tax is objectionable because God can not ask His people to pay a tax which is similar to the taxes paid by subdued peoples to Rome. This logical explanation presupposed that opposition existed in some Jewish circles to the Temple tax. A newly published fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls proves that the Dead Sea sect also opposed the Temple tax. It is therefore probable that Matth, xvii 24-27 expresses in some way the views of the Essene community about the Temple tax which were subscribed to by the Jerusalem Church. BIBLICAL MIDRASH AND HOMERIC EXEGESIS by E. E. Hallewy {pp. 157-169) The aggadic works are essentially a sort of commentary on the Bible in the form of questions and answers. In this respect, they resemble Greek and Hellenistic com mentaries to the poems of Homer, although in many aggadic homilies, the questions are missing from the text and only the answers remain. On the basis of Aristotle's Poetics Chapter 25, which contains all the arguments against Homer in five paragraphs, we can reduce all the numerous and sundry problems of the Midrashim to two fundamental questions: 1) explicit denials (the Biblical text denies in one place a statement which appeared in another passage) and contradictions (the Bible contradicts its own principles, or what the aggadists regarded as its ethical and religious principles); 2) passages eliciting surprise (the Bible makes statements which appear unreasonable; the argument of alogia) and obscure passages (the Bible contains obscure, unintelligible matters). Antisthenes and Zeno tried to explain the contradictions in Homer on the assumption that some of his statements came from his imagination and others were actually true (ChrysostonTs Discourse, 53, 5). The authors of the Midrashim, however, devised numerous ways to introduce harmony into the biblical texts, including the principle method of reaching a decision on the basis of either an explicit or unknown factor in the Bible ("a third passage"). According to one Midrashic tradition (Jerusalem Talmud Pesahim VI, 1) Hillel discovered this method while he was still in Babylonia. The discovery so upset him that he decided to go to Jerusalem and suggest it to the scholars there. However, at this point, he learned that his discovery had long before been revealed to the sages of Eretz Yisrael. And as a matter of fact, we do find this method being used also in the Book of Jubilees (47, 2) which antedated Hillel, as well as in Chrysostom's Dis course (30, 8; 61) and in Plutarch's Moralia (22c), two writers who lived after him. In explaining texts containing anthropomorphic and anthropathetic references, the authors of the Midrashim sometimes make use of other passages to refute them in</page><page sequence="4">IV SUMMARIES order to negate them entirely. This method approximates to the one recommended by Plutarch to the teachers of poetry to the young for the purpose of eliminating the influence and force of verses which do not correspond to the philosophical outlook (Moralia 20e). The method of the aggadic writers of explaining texts by introducing a new ethical note into the ancient narrative was known to Homer's early and late commentators (Cf. Isocrates 13, 2). MIDRESHE HALAKHA IN THE LITURGICAL POETRY OF YANNAI (SIFRA AND SIFRE-DEUT.) by Z. M. Rabinowitz {pp. 170-187) The discovery of Qerovot of Yannai in the Geniza collection considerably enriched the study of Hebrew liturgical poetry. One of the early liturgical poets whose poetry served as a model for his successors was brought to light. In the introduction to Piyyute Yannai the editor, M. Zulay, wrote: "The poetical form fashioned by Yannai is the mother of all forms in the literature of the piyyut and the finest flower of those categories of elaborate piyyut which are built to a system and plan." But hitherto the sources of Yannai's Qerovot without which the latter cannot be understood have not been studied. The first scholars of Yannai such as Israel Davidson, L. Ginzberg and M. Zulay drew attention to the considerable role played by the Midrash and Halakha in his poetry. The present article is a chapter from a comprehensive work on The Midreshei Hala kha and Aggada in Yannai's Poetry. Its aim is to find parallels for all the utterances of the poet on Halakhic and Aggadic themes in Midrashic and Halakhic literature accompanied by explanations and discussion of the relationship between the poet's words and the Midrash, variant readings, formulation and content and the paytan's independent approach in matters of Halakha and Aggada. Parallels to Sifra (the rabbinic commentary to Leviticus) are to be found in Yannai's piyyut to portions of the Halakha and Aggada. The Qerovot to Leviticus contain many halakhot. In the sedarim (weekly Sabbath readings) to Exodus and Numbers too there are many halakhot that can be traced to Sifra, in particular, in the Qerovot to we'ata tezawwe (Exodus xxvii 20) and to behacalotekha et hannerot (Numbers viii, 1). The poet had a special liking for the candlestick in the Temple and what it sym bolised: the light of Torah and redemption. As a rule, Halakhic and Aggadic themes are merged in the Qerovot and there are graftings from both Sifra and Leviticus Rabba. Special importance attaches to parallels from Sifra in Yannai's piyyut in order to understand the piyyut and clarify the Palestinian Halakha and prayer rite. In Yannai there can also be found material parallel to the expositions in Sifre on Deuteronomy. Some of the parallel material to Sifre is to be found too in other sources such as the Mishna, Tosefta and Midreshe Aggada. It is difficult to decide which is the principle source. But the correspondence of some of the material in the Qerovot to the same sedarim in Deut, which are expounded in Sifre, points to the Sifre as the source for Yannai's piyyut. Thus, for instance, the Qerova to shemaי Yisrael (Deut vi, 4) contains parallels to Sifre, and the same applies to the Qerova to wezot habberakha (Deut, xxxiii, 1 — xxxiv, 12). Sometimes the order and content exactly parallels the expositions in Sifre. Here too the parallels are important for clarifying the content and wording of the piyyut and Midrash.</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES ON THE FORM AND ETYMOLOGY OF HAI GA'ON'S NAME by S. Morag {pp. 188-190) Some medieval Spanish Hebrew poets consider the proper name spelled h'y or h'yy to consist of two syllables. As is well known, the usual form of this name is mono syllabic: the famous Ga'on is called Hai Ga'on by members of most Jewish commu nities. However, this is not the only form of the name in question; in the Yemenite tradition, it is haye. It is shown that the form haye is the Babylonian Aramaic correspondent of earlier Aramaic hayye (and the counterpart of Hebrew hayyim): the shift h&gt;h is common in Babylonian Aramaic, and the dissimilation yy&gt;y occurs, particularly in forms derived from the root hyy, both in Targum Aramaic and in Babylonian Aramaic (as preserved in the Yemenite tradition). The Yemenite tradition thus assists us in explaining the bisyllabic form of the name in Medieval Hebrew poetry. It also appears that the spelling h'yy, quite common in Hebrew literature, reflects the form haye rather than the form hai. LETTERS BY GE'ONIM (end) by S. Abramson (pp. 191-213) III. It has been shown in chapter I (above p. 43 seq.) that Mss. T-S 10 G 5s (=1) and T-S 20.100 (=2) are but two fragments of one leaf. The recto of these frag ments was published there. In this chapter the verso of the fragments is dealt with. Both these fragments have been published by Mann (Texts and Studies, I), but, due to his failure to recognize the connection between the two, he ascribed one (=1) to R. Samuel b. Hofni (ibid. pp. 162-3) and the other (=2), as the contents show, to R. Haya Ga'on (ibid. pp. 119-122). In fact both were written by R. Haya. The letter is of great importance for knowledge of the relations between the Pumbadita Academy in Baghdad and the dignitaries of the Diaspora. The letter is being republished here for the improved readings, which resulted from a re-examination of the Ms. In the introduction data concerning the scholars mentioned in the letter are dis cussed, and in connection with R. Hanokh, "the Spaniard", who is mentioned here, the journey of R. Joseph Abitur, R. Hanokh's famous opponent, is clarified. It is suggested in the introduction that the letter was addressed to R. Yehuda b. Joseph, "Alluf" of Kairouan, and material, both published and unpublished, concerning him as well as the others mentioned in the letter is collected here. In Appendix I a letter written to R. Jacob b. Awkal "Alluf" at Fostat is published according to Ms. Adler 3795 7; and in Appendix II a letter by R. Jacob b. Nissim "Alluf" of Kairouan, written to scholars in Kabes is published according to Ms. T-S 16.62. In the "addition" data concerning the scribe of Mss. I-II mentioned in the be ginning of the article are collected. All of them are to be found in the University Library, Cambridge.</page><page sequence="6">VI SUMMARIES BOOK REVIEW RAPHAEL LEVY, CONTRIBUTION Ä LA LEXICOGRÄPHIE FRAN^AISE SELON D'ANCIENS TEXTES D'ORIGINE JUIVE by M. Banitt (pp. 214-226) The author, who has already published a number of studies on glosses of some special interest found in Judaeo-French texts, compiled here about 600 entries dealing with the rest of the 815 glosses listed in his Recherches lexicographiques (Paris 1932). A thorough perusal of hundreds of texts connected with Old French vocabulary enabled the author to antedate the first appearance of almost one hundred words or meanings in French and to correct many data in dictionaries and glossaries. A note worthy 'contributionי indeed. It is regrettable, however, that he thought fit to impose on himself certain limitations, which strongly impair the relevancy of his contribution. Above all, his disregard of the Jewish context, the rabbinical commentaries and, to a certain extent, even the Biblical text, leads obviously to an erroneous interpretation of the meaning of many a gloss, invalidating ipso facto his findings about them. Ignoring, too, the conclusions drawn from studies of other Judaeo-Romance glos saries as to the peculiarities of Biblical translations, the author insists on considering the many derivations, created ad hoc, as words of normal currency; to try and integrate them in the general framework of the French language seems therefore an unprofit able endeavour. One would rather be inclined to accept the logical view that Jews, who lived among Frenchmen, also spoke their language, the so-called Judaeo-French words being confined to liturgical texts and usage. This would explain their rareness in texts like account books, as well as the dialectal divergences between the glossaries. R. Levy, however, seems to visualize a specific Judaeo-French idiom, coined by Rashi in the twelfth century, which remained immutable in time and space, any discrepancy being considered "insolite" and "bizarre". Would it not have been much more '000^^1^6י to have studied just these dialectical traits, in order to determine the locality of the MSS. and give us an insight into the exegetic tradition of the Middle Ages and in order to try and discover traces of Jewish speech peculiarities and bring to light perhaps certain facts about Old French, which are obscured by the clerical tradition of the non-Jewish texts? Apparently, only the critical edition of the various glossaries, including their rabbin ical commentary, will enable us to get the full value out of these documents.</page></plain_text>
