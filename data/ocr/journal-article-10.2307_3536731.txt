We determined age and growth of Oregon chub at 3 locations and the timing of spawning at 2 locations. We found that Oregon chub live much longer than previously thought (up to 9 y) and that most of the fish older than 5 y were females. We found strong relationships between somatic growth and otolith (lapillus) growth within populations and considerable variation among populations. Mature fish were primarily-2 y old, and all fish &gt;40 mm long had gonads that were developing or mature. Oregon chub spawned from mid-May through early August with peak activity in July. Juveniles that hatched prior to mid-June were not found in October, suggesting reduced survival of early hatched fish. Key words: Oregon chub, Oregonichthys crameri, age, growth, timing of spawning, otolith analyses, Willamette River, Oregon Oregon chub Oregonichthys crameri are small floodplain minnows endemic to the Willamette River of western Oregon. This species was for- merly distributed throughout the Willamette Valley (Snyder 1908) in off-channel habitats such as beaver ponds, oxbows, sloughs, back- water pools, and flooded marshes (Markle and others 1991). In the last century, these habitats disappeared rapidly because of changes in sea- sonal flows resulting from the construction of dams throughout the basin, channelization, re- vetments, diking, drainage of wetlands, and agricultural practices. The reduction of suitable habitat and the restricted distribution of the Oregon chub resulted in a determination of /'endangered" status under the federal endan- gered species act in 1993 (Markle and Pearsons 1990; USFWS 1993). Recent recovery efforts include monitoring and protecting naturally occurring Oregon chub populations and their habitats, reintro- ducing Oregon chub within their historic range, monitoring reintroduced Oregon chub populations, and monitoring the effects of land use activities on Oregon chub populations and their habitat (USFWS 1998; Scheerer 2002). We conducted this study to determine age and growth of adult Oregon chub, timing of spawning, and growth rates of juveniles, data which are essential for developing scientifically defensible management and restoration plans for Oregon chub. These data are useful in as- sessing the impacts and/or risks of environ- mental or anthropomorphic disturbances on individual populations, which differ if a spe- cies is short-lived versus long-lived. Knowl- edge of the timing of spawning and the tem- peratures when spawning occurs will aid in the protection of this species by avoiding handling or harassment during key periods and in de- termining the suitability of potential introduc- tion sites. Understanding patterns of growth and the relationships between pond tempera- tures and growth may explain differences in population abundance among sites and aid in evaluating potential reintroduction sites. STUDY AREA AND METHODS This study was conducted at 3 sites located near Lookout Point Reservoir in the Middle 68</page><page sequence="2">AUTUMN 2003 SCHEERER AND MCDONALD: OREGON CHUB AGE, GROWTH, SPAWNING 69 Fork Willamette River subbasin: East Fork Min- now Creek Pond, Hospital Pond, and Shady Dell Pond. All 3 locations have supported sta- ble and abundant Oregon chub populations (&gt;2500 fish) for the past 5 y (Scheerer and oth- ers 2002). The major differences among the 3 sites are water temperature regimes and chang- es in pond areas during the spring and summer months. Hospital Pond is a cold, spring-fed pond that is typically connected to the reser- voir by a culvert between mid-May and early- July of each year. The pond was created ap- proximately 50 y ago when Lookout Point Dam was being constructed. An access road on the north side of the reservoir created the pond by partially blocking a small tributary. Pond tem- peratures remain relatively constant and cold (9 to 11째C) during most of the year and increase to 15 to 16째C for a short period (6 to 8 wk) when the reservoir is full. Pond surface area increases from about 1800 m2 to about 4400 m2 when the reservoir is full and a vegetated terrace is flooded. Shady Dell Pond and East Fork Min- now Creek Ponds are isolated from the reser- voir throughout the year. Shady Dell Pond was a former side channel that was isolated by the construction of a state highway on the south side of Lookout Point Reservoir. East Fork Min- now Creek Pond is a large beaver pond that has been in existence for over 20 years. The surface areas of these ponds are greatest during the winter and spring (about 4300 m2 and 9500 m2, respectively) and lowest in the summer and early fall (about 1500 m2 and 7125 m2, respec- tively). Pond temperatures begin warming in May and exceed 16째C throughout the summer, which is the temperature threshold at which spawning has been observed in the field and in the laboratory (Scheerer and McDonald 2000). Adult Oregon chub (5 per month per site) were collected for aging using a dipnet, min- now trap, or seine. Monthly collections allowed us to determine the timing of annulus forma- tion using marginal increment analysis (Bag- enal and Tesch 1978). Fish were sacrificed and stored in 95% ethanol. Fish were collected De- cember 1996 through November 1998 from East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (n = 120) and Shady Dell Pond (n = 120) and from March 1998 through February 1999 from Hospital Pond (n = 60). Samples were not randomly collected. Fish were collected to include the range of sizes present in the pond at the time of collection; hence, larger fish were collected disproportion- ately to their abundance. All Oregon chub in this study were collected under endangered species permit TE-818627 issued by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Total fish length was measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. The right lapillus was removed from each fish using a fine tip probe under a dis- secting scope. Aging of fish collected in 1998 from East Fork Minnow Creek Pond was done using the left lapillus. These were the 1st fish processed, and initial otolith preparation using the right lapillus yielded unsatisfactory results. Each lapillus that was removed was soaked in a 10% bleach solution for several minutes to re- move tissue, rinsed with water, rinsed a 2nd time with 95% ethanol, and allowed to air dry (Secor and others 1992). Cleaned lapilli were weighed (+0.0001 mg) using an electrobalance. Lapilli from adult fish were embedded into molds (plugs) of epoxide resin (Secor and oth- ers 1992), which were then mounted on glass slides for thin sectioning using a low speed di- amond blade saw. Two transverse cuts were made into the plug to produce a thin section (0.5mm) that included the core. Thin sections were mounted on glass slides in thermoplastic glue and polished using a 0.05- to 5.0-1l alu- mina suspension and 1500 grit wet-dry sand- paper. Adult lapillus sections were aged using transmitted light at 25 X under a compound mi- croscope. The 1st prominent opaque band en- circling the core was designated as the 1st an- nulus. Distances between the otolith core and outer edge of each annulus and between the core and the outer edge of the otolith were mea- sured under transmitted light at 100X using digital imaging software. The distance between the last annulus and the leading edge of the otolith was used for marginal increment anal- ysis to determine the timing of annulus for- mation (Bagenal and Tesch 1978). Mean mar- ginal increments were plotted for fish collected each month for each age class. Fish from all sample locations were pooled for these analy- ses. The time of annulus formation was as- signed to the month when the mean marginal increment was at a minimum (Bagenal and Tesch 1978). Lapilli from adult fish were read indepen- dently 2 times by the same reader, about 5 months apart, to estimate precision. If the 1st</page><page sequence="3">70 NORTHWESTERN NATURALIST 84(2) deposition was 1.01 increment per day (r2 = 0.997; Scheerer and Apke 1998). Juvenile Oregon chub were collected from East Fork Minnow Creek Pond in October 1997 (n = 50), July 1998 (n = 50), and October 1998 (n = 43) and from Hospital Pond in July 1998 (n = 50) and October 1998 (n = 50). All samples were placed immediately in 95째/O ethanol and taken to the laboratory for processing. Right lapilli were removed using a fine tip probe under a dissecting scope and mounted dorsoventrally on glass slides with thermoplastic glue. Lapilli were polished in the sagittal plane to the core, flipped, and polished again until a thin section containing the core remained. Lapilli were pol- ished using 1500 grit wet-dry sandpaper and a 0.05-1l to 5.0-1l alumina suspension. The stan- dard length (+0.01 mm) of each juvenile was measured. Lapilli from juvenile chub were aged under transmitted light at 1000X using digital imag- ing software. Each light and dark band combi- nation was counted as a daily growth incre- ment (DGI). Immersion oil was used to en- hance the resolution of the bands. Increments that disappeared when adjusting the fine focus were considered sub-daily increments and were not counted (Campana and Neilson 1985). Counts of DGI were made from the core to the edge of the otolith along the anterior-posterior growth axis. The distances between DGI were recorded as the distance between the middle of 1 dark band to the next. Juvenile hatch dates were determined by subtracting the age in days from the date of capture. Approximate spawn- ing dates were assumed to be 7 to 10 d prior to hatching, based on incubation data from a sim- ilar co-occurring cyprinid, the redside shiner Richardsonius balteatus (Weisel and Newman 1951). This incubation period is consistent with field observations at Shady Dell Pond (Markle and others 1991). Hatch date distributions were compared using chi-square tests, where each category represented a 7-d period. We examined both mean length-at-age and mean incremental growth over time to deter- mine when juvenile chub growth was maxi- mized in relation to their age, the time of year, and pond temperatures. Average daily growth rates (mm/d) were estimated by dividing the length at capture by age in days. Comparisons between locations were made using t-tests. Growth rates were determined using a linear and 2nd age disagreed, then a 3rd count was made. Fish were assigned the age that agreed with either of the previous 2 counts. Individu- als that had 3 different counts were excluded from analysis. The percent disagreement, or percent of the fish where count 1 differed from count 2, was calculated to describe reader pre- . . clslon. The relationship between total length and otolith (lapillus) radius was described using linear regression. For each population, the back-calculated length-at-age was determined using a body proportional method (Francis 1990). The equation was: total fish length at age = (otolith radius X slope + y-intercept) X CR where CR was the ratio of observed length to predicted length (Francis 1990). The slopes and intercepts of linear regressions of length on age were compared among locations and between years within locations using analysis of covari- ance (ANCOVA). The relationship between total length and logl0 otolith weight was described using linear regression. Comparisons among locations were made using ANCOVA. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were es- timated from lengths back-calculated to the most recent annulus. To avoid violating statis- tical independence, length was not back-calcu- lated beyond the most recent annulus (Vaughan and Burton 1994). These parameters were fitted and statistically compared using a randomi- zation method (Helser 1996). The sex of each adult chub was determined by dissection and visual examination of the go- nads. Oregon chub were classified as breeding (containing developed or maturing gonads) or non-breeding. Breeding adult chub had swol- len gonads that completely filled their body cavities. Non-breeding fish had reduced and translucent gonads. The presence and promi- nence of breeding tubercles on male Oregon chub was also noted. Hatch date analysis was conducted on juve- nile Oregon chub to determine approximate spawning times and differential brood surviv- al. We conducted a larval marking experiment in 1997 in East Fork Minnow Creek Pond and determined that the rate of lapillus increment</page><page sequence="4">Age 1 _ 100- 90 X 80- 짖 70- * + * * _ * E 50 - - _ _ _ ' 40 - _ X 30- -&gt; 20- :; 10- O J F M A M J J A S O N D Monffi Age 2 100 - i 90 _ 80 - - k 70 - - _ * E 60- - - * - e 9 + * + + _ * + Q 40 - - ,s 30- &gt; 20 - _ E 1 0 - O J F M A M J J A S O N D Month Age 3 1 00 - _ 90 - ' 80 - B 70- ,,, 60- Q 40 - - * { + * ,e, 30 - _ 3, 20 - - a * - E 1 0 - _ O J F M A M J J A S O N D Month FIGURE 1.

Female fish comprised the majority of the fish &gt;3 y old at all locations (mean 81%; range 79 to 100%). There were strong relationships between so- matic growth (total fish length) and otolith growth (lapillus weight) at each location. An exponential equation best described the rela- tionships at East Fork Minnow Creek Pond and Hospital Pond, while a power equation best de- scribed the relationship at Shady Dell Pond: AUTUMN 2003 SCHEERER AND MCDONALD: OREGON CHUB AGE, GROWTH, SPAWNING 71 regression of length on age, and comparisons between locations were made using ANCOVA. Lapilli from juvenile fish were read indepen- dently 2 times, approximately 1 month apart. If the 1st and 2nd age differed by 4 d for July sam- ples or 7 d for October samples, then a 3rd count was made. The final age assigned was the age from the previous 2 counts that was closest to the 3rd count. Precision was estimated by comparing the slopes of regressions of length on age using ANCOVA and by comparing hatch date distributions from the 2 indepen- dent aging sessions using chi-square tests. Pond water temperatures were recorded at 5- h intervals throughout the study at East Fork Minnow Creek, Hospital, and Shady Dell Ponds using Hobo' temperature loggers to de- termine the effects of temperature on growth rates and on the initiation and duration of spawning activity. RESULTS Adult Aging Oregon chub lapilli revealed patterns of con- sistent and interpretable growth. The core area was generally dark in color and was encom- passed by a prominent broad opaque band. The outer edge of this opaque band was interpreted as the 1st annulus. Successive annuli (opaque bands) were thinner and more narrowly spaced. This pattern was consistent on most of the lapilli regardless of population. One opaque and translucent zone together repre- sents 1 full year. Because we did not have known-age fish to validate the ages of Oregon chub, we acknowl- edge that annuli are putative and some ages may be underestimates. We found, using mar- ginal increment analysis (MIA), that the dis- tance between the annulus and the otolith mar- gin was smallest in June and July for 1- to 3-y- old fish (Fig. 1). Small sample sizes for fish '4 y old precluded interpretation using MIA. The distance between the annulus and the otolith margin increased from August until December, then leveled off through May. Our MIA sug- gests that annuli (opaque bands) were depos- ited on chub lapilli in June to July. Age distributions were similar at all 3 loca- tions with the majority of the fish aged '3 y (mean 91%; range 88 to 97%; Table 1).

Length-at-age for juvenile chub at East Fork Minnow Creek and Hospital Ponds in 1998. The 1st increment was readily identifiable on most lapilli. Subsequent increments 2 to 20 were more difficult to interpret. This zone (in- crements 2 to 20) was characterized by many sub-daily rings or checks. Increments in the next zone (increments &gt;20) were very clear and easy to read. The edges of the lapilli from larg- er juveniles were also difficult to interpret, due to narrow spacing between increments. There was a strong relationship between ju- venile length and age at both locations (Fig. 3). Juveniles from Hospital Pond were larger at a given age than similarly aged juveniles from East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (F = 5.34, df = 172, P &lt; 0.001 [slopes]; F = 44.50J df = 173, P &lt; 0.001 [intercepts]). The mean daily growth rates for juvenile chub &lt;55 d old (collected in July) were greater than the growth rates for fish &gt;54 d old (col- lected in October) at both locations (Fig. 4). The growth rate for chub collected in July in East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (0.26 mm/d, range 0.22 to 0.34 mm/d) was significantly higher than the rate for chub collected in October (0.19 mm/d, range 0.17 to 0.23 mm/d; t =-15.1, df = 68, P &lt; 0.001). The growth rate for chub col- lected in July in Hospital Pond (0.30 mm/d, range 0.24 to 0.40 mm/d) was significantly higher than the rate for chub collected in Oc- tober (0.21 mm/d, range 0.18 to 0.25 mm/d; t =-14.8, df = 56, P &lt; 0.001). This trend likely applies only to growth measured in terms of length. Daily weight gain was not measured, but was likely greater in the older chub. Juvenile Oregon chub from Hospital Pond grew faster than chub from East Fork Minnow Creek Pond.

Similarly, the growth rate for chub collected in October from Hospital Pond (0.21 mm/d, range 0.18 to 0.25 mm/d) was signifi- cantly higher than the rate for chub collected in October from East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (0.19 mm/d, range 0.17 to 0.23 mm/d; t = 3.65, df = 87, P &lt; 0.001).

However, the peak at Hospital Pond was approximately 2 wk earlier (Fig. 5). The growth rates closely paralleled changes in pond temperature at East Fork Min- now Creek Pond but not at Hospital Pond. The reduction in temperature at Hospital Pond, which happened when the pond was isolated from reservoir, occurred approximately 10 d prior to the reduction in growth rate for fish at that location. This may indicate that juvenile ages were overestimated at Hospital Pond, however it seems unlikely because otolith mi- crostructure and the ease of aging was similar for juveniles from Hospital Pond and Minnow Pond. Hatch Date Distributions Hatch date analyses showed that successful spawning of Oregon chub occurs over a broad period from late-spring into the summer. The distribution of hatch dates in East Fork Minnow Creek Pond ranged from 8 June through 3 Au- gust 1998 (57 d ) when pond temperatures ranged from 17 to 23째C (Fig. 6).

Hatch-date distributions for Oregon chub from Hospital and East Fork Minnow Creek Ponds collected in July and October 1998. Pond the hatch date distribution extended from 31 May through 12 July 1998 (43 d), when pond temperatures ranged from 15 to 17째C. The 1998 hatch date distributions at Hospital Pond and East Fork Minnow Creek Pond were signifi- cantly different (X2 = 25.43, df = 6, P &lt; 0.001). Not surprisingly, there were significant differ- ences between 1998 hatch date distributions for fish collected in the summer (July) vs. those collected in the fall (October), at both East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (X2 = 34.4, df = 4, P &lt; 0.001) and Hospital Pond (X2-58.9, df = 4, P &lt; 0.001). At both locations no fish hatched prior to 14 June were present in the October samples (Fig. 7), suggesting limited survival of these earliest hatched fish. Aging Precision Estimates Multiple aging of individual fish is common- ly used in aging studies to measure precision. We found the aging of adult chub lapilli to be highly repeatable. Overall, there was 93% agreement (range 92 to 96%) between the ini- tial and the repeat counts. No discrepancies were more than + 1 year, and all were resolved after a 3rd reading. The aging precision for lapilli from juvenile AUTUMN 2003 SCHEERER AND MCDONALD: OREGON CHUB AGE, GROWTH, SPAWNING 77 chub was examined by comparing hatch date distributions from the initial aging and the re- peat aging. No significant differences were found at East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (X2 = 9.08, df-7, P &gt; 0.10) or Hospital Pond (X2 = 8.44, df = 6, P &gt; 0.10). In addition, the regres- sion coefficients were compared from the length-at-age relationships. At East Fork Min- now Creek Pond, the 2 counts resulted in sig- nificantly different slopes (F = 2.95, df = 170, P &lt; 0.005) and intercepts (F = 5.96, df = 171, P &lt; 0.001). However, the length-at-age relation- ship from resolved ages showed no significant differences between the slopes (F = 0.204, df = 170, P &gt; 0.20) or intercepts (F = 1.61, df = 171, P &gt; 0.10) when compared to the length-at-age relationship from the 1st count. At Hospital Pond, the 2 counts resulted in similar slopes (F = 1.25, df = 172, P &gt; 0.20) and different inter- cepts (F = 2.10, df = 173, P &lt; 0.05). Again, the resulting length-at-age relationship, using re- solved ages, showed no significant differences between the slopes (F = 0.31, df = 172, P &gt; 0.5) or intercepts (F = 0.29, df = 173, P &gt; 0.5) when compared to the relationship from the 1 st count. DISCUSSION Adult Oregon chub were previously thought to be a relatively short-lived minnow. Pearsons (1989) separated chub into 3 presumed year classes (0 to 1 y, 1 to 2 y, and 2 to 3 y) based on length frequencies. We found that Oregon chub live much longer than previously expected. Us- ing otolith aging, we found Oregon chub males up to 7 y old and females up to 9 y old. The proportion of fish older than-3 y was low in all populations (&lt; 10%). Underestimation of age is not uncommon in western minnows. Val- idated ages in blue chub (G. coerulea), Sacra- mento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Col- orado pikeminnow (1? lucius), tui chub (G. bi- color), and leatherside chub (G. copei) were sev- eral times older than previously thought (Scoppettone 1988; Johnson and others 1995). Longevity in fishes is a mechanism that can buffer populations from year-class failures due to unfavorable environmental conditions that might otherwise doom short-lived species. We found, using marginal increment analy- sis, that chub annuli were deposited on lapilli in June to July. We can use this knowledge to differentiate year-classes in Oregon chub pop-</page><page sequence="11">78 NORTHWESTERN NATURALIST 84(2) ulations. For example, age-2 fish collected in the spring are from the same year class as age- 2 fish collected the previous fall, but are from a different year-class than age-2 fish collected in the summer and fall of the same year. These data can be used to track the abundance of in- dividual year-classes, to predict or assess changes in population abundance from year to year, and to infer relationships between these changes and changes in physical habitat and environmental variables. We found that all chub &gt;40 mm were devel- oping or mature, that mature fish were primar- ily &gt;2 y old, and that maturity appears to be size- rather than age-dependent. This is consis- tent with data for other small western min- nows, which have been found to spawn in their 2nd year of life or older (Weisel and Newman 1951; Johnson and others 1995). We can use this information, in combination with our annual population abundance estimates and age com- position data, to estimate the abundance of the spawning population at each location, and pos- sibly to develop stock-recruitment models. We found substantial differences in age, growth, and timing of spawning among pop- ulations of Oregon chub. Both juvenile and adult Oregon chub at Hospital Pond had higher growth rates than chub at East Fork Minnow Creek Pond and relationships between fish length and otolith radius indicated that larval chub at Hospital Pond were significantly larger at hatch than larval chub at East Fork Minnow Creek Pond. Density-dependent factors do not appear to explain these results. Hospital Pond had a higher density of adult fish of all species combined in 1998 (0.94 fish/m2), except during the brief period when the reservoir is full, than East Fork Minnow Creek Pond (0.69 fish/m2; Scheerer and McDonald 2000). Pond tempera- tures were also consistently cooler at Hospital Pond during the spring and summer than at East Fork Minnow Creek Pond. These differ- ences are of particular interest because gene flow among populations of Oregon chub is very low or nonexistent (Scheerer 2002). Conse- quently, these findings suggest a need for ge- netic studies into the heritable variation of dif- ferent population traits. If these traits have a genetic basis, they are extremely important both as a fundamental precept of recovery planning and as parameters to be considered when planning future reintroductions into new habitats. Hatch-date analysis is a powerful tool for de- termining the approximate spawning distri- bution and relative brood survival for a popu- lation of fish (Campana and Neilson 1985). We found, using hatch-date analysis, that Oregon chub spawned from mid-May through early August with peak activity in July at tempera- tures &gt; 1 5째C. Spawning activity has been ob- served in the field and in the laboratory during this same time period (Scheerer and McDonald 2000). This knowledge allows us to minimize handling or harassing chub during spawning and to avoid scheduling activities at or near chub habitats during and immediately prior to the spawning season. This knowledge may also be useful for determining those factors that af- fect the timing and success of spawning and in determining whether potential reintroduction sites have suitable temperatures for spawning of Oregon chub. We found that the hatch-date distribution at Hospital Pond was truncated in the summer, compared to East Fork Minnow Creek Pond, and coincided with the drop in pond temper- atures that occurred when the pond was iso- lated from the reservoir and the shallow veg- etated terrace in the pond was dewatered. The result is that eggs spawned on vegetation on the dewatered terrace desiccate and die when the pond level drops. Chub larvae may also have reduced survival at the lower pond tem- peratures that occur when the pond becomes isolated from the reservoir. Humpback chub (Gila cypha) eggs incubated at low water tem- peratures (12 to 13째C) showed only 12% and 15% survival to the egg and swim-up fry stag- es, respectively, compared to 62% and 91% sur- vival at temperatures of 16 to 17째C (Hamman 1982). These findings have implications regard- ing reservoir operation and potential habitat modifications, such as the installation of a standpipe or water control structure to main- tain water levels, to extend the suitable spawn- ing period at this site. In summary, the information we gathered in this study enhances our ability to recover this species. The ability to make management de- cisions is enhanced with knowledge of the age and growth of Oregon chub, size and age at maturity, the timing and duration of spawning</page><page sequence="12">AUTUMN 2003 SCHEERER AND MCDONALD: OREGON CHUB AGE, GROWTH, SPAWNING 79 endangered minnow, Oregon chub Oregonichthys crameri, in the Willamette River, Oregon.
