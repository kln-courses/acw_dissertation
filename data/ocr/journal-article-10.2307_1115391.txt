The intimation that adequacy of legal remedy at the moment of first breach forecloses the intervention of equity later seems untenable, since there was no showing by the defendants of any laches.'1 CORPORATIONS-EFFECT OF PRIOR ADVERSE JUDGMENT ON MERITS WHEN REN- DERED AT SAME TIME AS FINDING OF NON-EXISTENCE-CORPORATE EXISTENCE AFTER DISSOLUTION.-The Mechanicville and Fort Edward Railroad Co. was in- corporated in 1880 but engaged in none of the activities which were the conditions of continued corporate existence. In an ejectment action brought by it in 1916 against the Fitchburg Railroad and the present defendant as lessee, the court de- cided without a jury (1) that the nominal plaintiff not having satisfied the statu- tory conditions, was not a corporation, and thus had not the legal capacity to sue, and (2) that the Mechanicville Railroad had no rights to the disputed land.l In 76 F.(2d) 988 (App. D.

The Special Term granted the motion of defendant to dismiss the complaint, which order was reversed by the Appellate Division4 on the grounds that the court in the 1916 action, after deciding that the plaintiff corporation did not exist, had no jurisdiction to make conclusive findings on the merits. On appeal, held, complaint dismissed. The corporation possessed sufficient existence to present to the court for judgment the issues of its existence and of its right to property. The objection to its capacity to sue was hence in effect a plea in abatement and the court, after upholding the objection, had jurisdiction to render a decision on the merits of the case which is res adjudicafa in this action. MacAffer et dl. v. Boston and Maine Railroad, 268 N. Y. 400, 197 N. E. 328 (1935). At common law a plea that the plaintiff was dead or non-existent was con- sidered a plea in abatement.5 If the code policy to allow matter in abatement to be pleaded with matter in bar,6 and the doctrine which holds a judgment on both pleas conclusive,7 are to include all types of what were originally pleas in abate- ment, there would be no need to consider here the question of corporate existence after dissolution. However, the settled principle, that no adjudication of the merits can be made when there is no plaintiff in the court,8 and the in- herent absurdity of such an adjudication necessitates a distinction between pleas which delay and those which permanently abate the action.9 There is some authority for classifying the plea of nul tiel corporation plaintiff as a plea in bar ;" 2The first judgment of dissolution was entered at the Albany County Clerk's Office, March 15, 1930. Two suits for injunctions were brought by the Boston &amp; Maine against the Delaware &amp; Hudson: 146 Misc. 221, 260 N.Y. Supp. 817 (Sup. Ct. 1932), rev'd, 238 App. Div. 191, 264 N. Y.

It then becomes essential to establish that the corporation was not totally dead and that the objection to the capacity to sue was a plea in abatement which merely delays, so as to come within the rule in the Sheldon case.l2 It is deserving of notice that most courts, unlike the one in the 1916 action, would have required a judicial procedure to declare for- feiture of corporate powers. The incorporating statute must usually demonstrate a clear intent to have the dissolution operate ipso factol3 and while there is prece- dent for a construction such as the one given in the 1916 action,14 statutes containing the same'5 and stronger'6 language have been held not to be self-executing. But after dissolution any further proceedings in the name of the corporation are said to be void.7 Following Story's dictum,18 the courts generally adopt the anthropomorphic analogy of human death'9 and speak of their "lack of jurisdiction" of the parties.2 Singularly absent from the American cases is any metaphysical inquiry into the nature of a corporation; the more extreme phases of the theory which regards the corporation as a real person2 are ignored while the fiction or concession22 seems to be tacitly assumed.23 Either of these schools would find it difficult, if not im- possible, to attribute any vestige of "life" to a dissolved corporation. It is sig- nificant, therefore, that the quite modern "functional" approach,24 which emphasizes the activities rather than the definition of a corporation, has found expression in two decisions of an Illinois court25 recognizing the "existence" for certain purposes of the corporate body after its technical dissolution. The biological analogy is 1 See supra note 8. 12 See supra note 7. The result in the instant case seems more easily reached because the operative facts decisive of the plea in abatement are the same facts upon which the title to the land was adjudicated: the continued non-user of the corporate franchise and easement.

CRIMINAL PROSECUTION-POWER OF COURT TO APPOINT PRIVATE ATTORNEY To CON- DUCT PROSECUTION.-The motion of the city attorney to dismiss prosecution of de- fendants arrested by police officers of Milwaukee and charged with unlawful as- semblage in violation of a city ordinance was denied by the district court on the grounds that a public interest was involved. On refusal of the city attorney to participate, the court appointed a private attorney as a "friend of the court" to proceed with the trial, over objections that the common council of Milwaukee is the only authority having power to appoint an attorney to act for the city, and the defendants were found guilty and fined. On appeal, held, affirmed. A case cannot be dismissed without an order of the court, whose duty it is to consider any public interests which may be involved, in determining whether or not to dismiss the ac- tion. The court properly called to its aid one of its officers, and did not need to resort to the collateral action of mandamus to compel prosecution. Gunther v. City of Milwaukee, 258 N. W. 865 (Wis. 1935). The exercise of the local prosecutor's broad discretion in instituting1 and con- tinuing2 prosecutions would seem to depend upon his judgment as to the sufficiency of the evidence available, conditioned to some extent by his conception of the social desirability of a conviction.3 However, the political nature of the prosecutor's office renders him peculiarly subject to pressure from ill-defined groups of varying homogeneity and political and economic power.4 Methods devised to escape their influence may be classified generally as directed toward either achieving mandatory prosecutions5 or reinforcing the judgment of the local prosecutor by that of another See 2 MORAWETZ, PRIVATE CORPORATIONS (2d ed. 1886) 1038. 27 See Kelly v.
