<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOOD OF THE GODS: THE RITUAL USE OF PINE (PINUS SPP.) BY THE ANCIENT LOWLAND MAYA Christopher T. Morehart, David L. Lentz, and Keith M. Prufer The recovery of pine (Pinus spp.) charcoal remains from ceremonial contexts at sites in the Maya Lowlands suggests that pine had a significant role in ancient Maya ritual activities. Data collected by the authors reveal that pine remains are a regular component of archaeobotanical assemblages from caves, sites that were used almost exclusively for ritual purposes, and that pine is often the dominant taxon of wood charcoal recovered. Comparisons with archaeobotanical data from sur- face sites likewise reveals that pine is common in ceremonial deposits. The authors propose that the appearance of pine remains in ceremonial contexts indicates pine was a valued element of Maya ritual paraphernalia. By basing interpreta- tions with analogous information from ethnography, ethnohistory, iconography, and epigraphy, the use of pine during rit- uals is argued to be have been linked with a symbolic complex of ritual burning and offering "food" sacrifices to deities. The possibility is raised that burning pine, perhaps as torches, during some ancient rituals was similar to the modern use of candles. The diversity of ceremonial contexts yielding pine suggests that burning pine may have been a basic element of ritual activities that was essential to establish the legitimacy of ritual performances. La recuperaciOn de restos de carbon de pino (Pinus spp.) de contextos ceremoniales en sitios de las tierras bajas mayas su- giere que tuvo un papel significativo en las actividades ceremoniales de los antiguos mayas. Datos recolectados por los autores senalan que los restos de pino son normales dentro de los materiales arqueobotanicos encontrados en cuevas; tipos de sitios usados casi exclusivamento para propOsitos rituales, y que el carbon de pino es el recuperado mas frecuentemente. Ademas, comparaciones con datos arqueobotanicos de otros sitios arqueolOgicos indican que el pino es coman en depOsitos ceremo- niales. Los autores proponen que la presencia de restos de pino en contextos ceremoniales revela que fue un elemento signi- ficativo en las actividades rituales mayas. Sobre interpretaciones basadas en informacion anciloga procedente de la etnografta, la etnohistoria, la iconografia, y la epigrafia el uso de madera de pino durante rituales tiene probablemente una relaciOn con un complejo de quemas rituales y ofrendas de sacrificios de "comida" a las deidades. Esto surge de la posibilidad de que el uso del pino, posiblemente en antorchas durante ciertos rituales antiguos, fuese similar al empleo moderno de las velas. La diversidad de los contextos ceremoniales en donde se encuentra el pino sugiere que la quema de pino posiblemente haya sido un elemento bcisico de las actividades rituales, esencial para establecer la autenticidad de las actividades ceremoniales. The growing application of paleoethnob- otanical techniques to the study of Maya prehistory has yielded considerable infor- mation on human subsistence and environmental adaptations from the Archaic period to the Colo- nial period (Cliff and Crane 1989; Crane 1986, 1996; Jones 1991; Lentz 1990, 1991, 1999; Lentz et al. 1996; Lentz et al. 1997; McKillop 1994, 1996; Miksicek 1983, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991; Miksicek et al. 1981; Morehart 2001a, 2002b, 2003; More- hart et al. 2004; Pohl et al. 1996; Turner and Mik- sicek 1984). Despite the increased use of paleoethnobotany in Maya archaeology, the approach has offered little insight about the ritual use of plants in ancient Maya society in its most common application, and virtually no reconstruc- tions of the ritual and symbolic life of the ancient Maya have employed archaeobotanical data. Recent paleoethnobotanical investigations at cave sites in the Maya Lowlands have revealed not only the potential of cave sites for the long-term preservation of organic remains, but also that plants and their products were important elements of Maya ritual life (Morehart 2001b, 2002a, 2002b; Prufer 2002). This paper focuses on the signifi- cance of one particular plant resource, pine (Pinus Christopher T.

In general, pine is one of the most common woods recovered from Maya archaeological sites, attesting to its widespread use. This dominance of pine remains is intriguing given that pine resources are not locally available for many sites in the Maya Lowlands. In this region, pine forests mainly are circumscribed geographically to swampy savanna lands, such as the Caribbean pine (Pines caribaea Morelet) forests of northern, central, and southern Belize and certain areas of Peten, Guatemala, and the Mountain Pine Ridge of western Belize, which is composed of both P. caribaea and P. oocarpa Schiede. Many, though not all, sites in the Maya Lowlands are located some distance from pine pop- ulations, though it is certainly possible that the dis- tribution of pine forests was different in the past. The widespread occurrence of pine remains at Maya sites in conjunction with the limited distrib- ution of pine forests reinforces the cultural signif- icance of pine use during the Maya past and has led some researchers to propose that pinewood or prepared pine charcoal may have been exchanged as trade goods during Maya prehistory (Lentz 1999:14; Lentz et al. 2003; Morehart 2002b; Thompson 1970:146). We suggest that remains of pine found at archae- ological sites in the Maya Lowlands fall into a con- textually based multiple-use category. Pine remains are common in domestic and other nonritual con- texts at many sites, evidence that pine served util- itarian purposes, such as domestic fuel or as building material. Yet the recovery of pine remains from cave sites we have investigated, as well as from ceremonial deposits at surface sites, suggests it also had a specific ritual function in these con- texts. By integrating the archaeobotanical data on pine with multiple lines of analogy from ethnohis- tory, ethnography, iconography, and epigraphy, we suggest that pine was a recognized component of ritual paraphernalia, with attendant symbolic mean- ing, and that the burning of pine was a basic ele- ment of many ritual activities. In particular, we explore the possibility that burning pine, often in the form of torches, may have served as symbolic offerings to sacred entities. The primary data utilized in this paper comes from several cave sites located in the upper Belize valley of western Belize (Morehart 2002b). Addi- tional comparisons are made with data from caves in the Maya Mountains of southern Belize (Prufer 2002). Published information on the occurrence of pine from other cave sites and from surface sites also is considered. The possibility that these pine remains were deposited naturally can be ruled out. Although some flora often become incorporated in archaeobotanical assemblages at cave sites through natural means (Morehart 2002b), most of the pine remains from the caves consist of burned wood recovered from deep within their interiors, deposi- tional characteristics unlikely to have been caused naturally. Furthermore, the majority of the cave sites and most of the surface sites with ceremoni- ally deposited pine are located considerable dis- tances, between 1-to-10 km at least, from the nearest modern pine forests, indicating that the pinewood was obtained from elsewhere and phys- ically brought to the sites. Interpretative Perspective Understanding the function of artifact assemblages is a primary archaeological goal. In order to ascer- tain the final use-functions of ancient artifacts and interpret their meanings, one must consider the social contexts that led to their deposition (Hodder 1987; Shanks and Hodder 1995:14). A bias in this process, however, is the assumption that artifacts had static functions. Utilitarian vs. nonutilitarian (i.e., ritual) is a functional dichotomy that archae- ologists commonly confront (Lesure 1999:24). Although some analyses presume that artifacts must fall neatly into one such classification or the other, they most often do not, and such antinomious classifications can lead to simplified inferences of past activities (Walker and Lucero 2000:132). Most artifacts had fluid use-trajectories, existing in mul- tiple contexts, and it is not uncommon to find arti- facts traditionally associated with domestic spheres in ceremonial contexts (Hodder 1985:14). Archaeologically recovered plant remains are artifactual assemblages that have been used pre- dominantly in reconstructions of ancient subsis- tence economies and environmental conditions. Although such investigations successfully have yielded information on the economic and ecolog-</page><page sequence="3">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 257 ical foundations of past societies, as with any other artifact type, plants were used in multiple contexts in ancient cultural systems. Like other forms of material culture, plants have "social lives" (Appadurai 1986; Rival 1998) that are variable and complex. Thus, a botanical product exploited for its economic utility may be equally valued for its use in ceremonial settings (Hastorf 1991; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Kolb and Murakami 1994). Although plant remains, such as pine, recovered from ceremonial archaeological contexts do pro- vide insight into ancient economic and ecological conditions, economic and ecological models alone cannot sufficiently place these data into a cultur- ally meaningful explanatory framework. When considering botanical data from ritual contexts, an interpretive perspective that emphasizes the sym- bolic significance of plant utilization will enrich reconstructions of the cultural biographies of plants (Kopytoff 1986) and add a new dimension to Maya paleoethnobotany. Ethnographic information on the contemporary Maya supports this perspective and offers a back- drop from which to base inferences (Morehart 2002b). Plants are significant components of mod- em Maya belief systems, and the plant world pro- vides a vehicle for symbolism. Among the contemporary Maya, there is a central belief that the natural world is alive or animate (Alcorn 1984; McGee 1990; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934; Vogt 1969, 1976; Wisdom 1940:401). All animated things, including plants, are believed to have a spirit, soul, or essence, a belief that can be traced deep into the past. For the Wastek Maya, the growth of plants is a symbol for the life cycle of humans, and their interrelationships are believed to be a metaphor for social life' (Alcorn 1984:94). The Wastek hold that plants are "'awls t'okat,' more sacred and pure, more respected than humans" (Alcorn 1984:93). Plants, and much of the natural and supra-physical world, are cast in a state of struc- tural oppositions (Alcorn 1984:96; Vogt 1976:71). Domesticated plants are associated with culture, and undomesticated plants are associated with nature, a realm inhabited by spirits, monsters, and deities. Plants are selected for modern Maya rituals based on the symbolic attributes that are associated with them (Alcorn 1984; Barrera Marin et al. 1976:302-320; Flores and Kanttin Balam 1997; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934:130; Steinberg 1999:132; Vogt 1976:66-72). These attributes are variable, but they are often based on conceptual oppositions, such as humoral qualities,2 or on broader cosmological features. Thus, each plant has its place not simply due to its utility but, rather, is selected for its cosmological and mythological history. These ritual plants "provide a rich canvas for the portrayal of crucial messages in symbolic code" (Vogt 1976:5), which cannot be grasped by only examining their economic potentials. Pine Remains from Cave Sites in the Maya Lowlands For the ancient Maya, caves and mountains were among the most sacred elements of their natural landscape, a belief still held by many modem Maya groups (Awe 1998; Bassie-Sweet 1991, 1996; Brady 1989, 1997; Brady and Ashmore 1999; Brady and Prufer 1999; MacLeod and Puleston 1978; Pohl and Pohl 1983; Prufer 2002; Stone 1995, 1997). Caves were believed to be access points to the interior of mountains, a realm inhab- ited by powerful earth deities in control of all mun- dane aspects of human existence. Ethnohistoric, ethnographic, iconographic, and epigraphic infor- mation on caves indicate that they were perceived as transitional loci between structurally opposite cosmological spheres, earth and underworld, night and day, and life and death. Such liminal realms often are associated with ritual and symbolic expe- rience (Turner 1969). Thus, caves were the stage for numerous activities that were laden with sacred import. Because little nonritual use of caves is known from the Maya Lowlands (see Brady 1989), caves offer an unprecedented opportunity to exam- ine the material remains of ceremonial behaviors, including the use of pine. Archaeobotanical investigations in the Maya Lowlands have documented an abundance of pine remains from cave sites, the majority of which are located in Belize (Table 1). Recent archaeobotan- ical research conducted as part of the Western Belize Regional Cave Project, directed by Dr. Jaime Awe, has yielded a prodigious assemblage of plant remains from a series of caves in the upper Belize Valley (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2) (Morehart 2001b, 2002a, 2002b). Sampled deposits range in date from the Early Classic period to the Late Classic</page><page sequence="4">258 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 16, No. 3, 2005 Table 1.

A.D. 250-900). Of all the archaeob- otanical remains recovered from the cave sites, the distribution of pine charcoal is of particular inter- est. An abundance of pine charcoal (Figure 3) was recovered from seven cave sites in three subvalleys of the greater upper Belize valley: Actun Nak Beh, Laberinto de las Tarantulas, and Twin Caves 2 in the Roaring Creek Valley; Barton Creek Cave in the Barton Creek Valley; and Actun Chapat, Actun Chechem Ha, and Actun Halal in the Macal River Valley. Samples were collected as one liter flota- tion samples from both stratified excavation levels and spatially discrete surface features and as radio- carbon samples that were later subsampled for botanical analysis. Good organic preservation per- mitted the recovery of small volumes of matrix for flotation, though multiple, one liter samples were sometimes recovered from single contexts. Addi- tionally, preliminary inspection of macrofloral sam- ples from Actun Tunichil Muknal and Actun Yaxteel Ahau, caves in the Roaring Creek valley that were not included in the formal archaeob- otanical study, also recorded pine charcoal remains. Although the fragmentary nature of the pine charcoal from the upper Belize valley cave sites pre- cludes any absolute assessment of how the wood was used (i.e., for torches, kindling, etc.), quan- tifiable patterns in the distribution of pine charcoal based on ubiquity (percentage of presence) and standardized weight measurements (see Miller 1988; Popper 1988:60-61) are informative. Because multiple samples frequently were col- lected from one deposit, ubiquity here is expressed as the percentage of sampled deposits containing a particular taxon out of all deposits instead of the percentage of samples containing a taxon out of all samples. When compared to hardwood charcoal, there are regional variations in the contribution of pine to the archaeobotanical assemblage from the cave sites. Pine remains were particularly preva- lent in caves located in the Roaring Creek Valley. At Actun Nak Beh, pine charcoal was found in all sampled deposits, but hardwoods were found in only 43 percent of deposits (n = 23). A similar dis- crepancy between hardwoods and pine is evident in the weight of charcoal from flotation samples.</page><page sequence="5">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 259 See Figure 2 La Milpa Naranjo Jolja' Cave Yaxchilan Caracol BELIZE Naj • Tunich GUATEMALA Copan See Figure 5 HONDURAS Yarumela 0 100 km EL SALVADOR Figure 1.

Scanning electron micrograph of pine (Pinus sp.) charcoal from Actun Nak Beh. Pine comprises 98 percent of Actun Nak Beh's total charcoal weight, whereas hardwoods comprise only one percent. On the other hand, the soils encountered at Actun Nak Beh were primarily dense silts and clays, which increased the difficulty of extracting plant remains through flotation (More- hart 2002b:208). Thus, relying on weight mea- surements may deflate the relative importance of hardwoods at the site to some degree. Twin Caves 2 and Laberinto de las Tarantulas, also in the Roaring Creek Valley, yielded abundant quantities of pine charcoal as well (Morehart 2002b). Investigations at both caves were limited mainly to reconnaissance and mapping, however, and only one context was sampled at each site: a surface hearth feature at Twin Caves 2 and an arti- ficial platform at Laberinto de las Tarantulas con- taining fragmented human remains. Because only one context was sampled, ubiquity values are nec- essarily 100 percent. Weight measurements also must be evaluated cautiously. At Twin Caves 2, 2.6 g of pine charcoal and .5 g of hardwood charcoal were recovered from two 1 liter flotation samples. On the other hand, at Laberinto de las Tarantulas, 1.86 g of pine charcoal versus 3.8 g of hardwoods was recovered from five one liter samples. Yet, 2.08 g of hardwood charcoal is represented by one taxon, Cordia sp., making pine the second most abundant taxon by weight. In general, samples from caves outside the Roar- ing Creek Valley contained less pine when com- pared to hardwood charcoal. Actun Chapat, located in the Macal River Valley, provides a good exam- ple. Excavations were undertaken in a series of arti- ficial terraces that likely served as foci for ritual offerings, and deposits were well preserved. Both pine and hardwood charcoal were recovered from all sampled deposits (n = 8). Based on ubiquity, this assessment would equate the contribution of both types of woods to Actun Chapat's archaeobotani- cal assemblage. Comparing the weight of pine and hardwood charcoal, however, demonstrates that this is not the case. Hardwoods compose 96 per- cent (13.53 g) of Actun Chapat's total charcoal weight (14.09 g), while only 4 percent (.56 g) is composed of pine, indicating that pine's overall</page><page sequence="7">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 261 Number of caves present 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Figure 4. Comparison of charcoal taxa from cave sites in the upper Belize valley showing the prominent distribution of pine. contribution to Actun Chapat's total charcoal assemblage is less than hardwoods' .3 The differential deposition of pine among the cave sites in the upper Belize Valley does not, we believe, reduce the significance of pine in caves where hardwoods dominate the charcoal assem- blages. The importance of hardwood charcoal potentially is inflated by comparing all taxa of hard- woods collectively with pine; comparing the dis- tribution of taxa identified to more specific taxonomic levels may be more meaningful (More- hart 2002b:127-128). Indeed, this issue under- scores that the utility of employing "hardwoods" as an analytical category must be qualified. The hardwood category has meaning mainly in regard to environmental distribution; hardwoods are abun- dant in the semideciduous, subtropical forests prox- imate to the Belize Valley cave sites, whereas pine trees are not. Yet both angiosperm and gymnosperm trees are classified collectively as trees in modem Maya folk taxonomies (Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999; Berlin et al. 1974; Breedlove and Hopkins 1971; Breedlove and Laughlin 1993; Metzger and Williams 1966). More specific folk subclassifica- tions are at the generic level and not between more abstract categories such as "hardwoods" (Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999:47-48; Berlin et al. 1974:27). Furthermore, most plants and animals classified at the generic level, usually the most culturally per- vasive and meaningful category, do correspond to scientific species (Anderson 2000; Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999:55-56; Berlin et al. 1974:101-102). More specific, intersite evaluation of individual taxa reveals that, out of 29 identified taxa, pine is the only taxon found at all seven cave sites (Figure 4). Moreover, intrasite evaluation of the charcoal collection demonstrates that pine is the most ubiq- uitous taxon at each cave site where multiple con- texts were sampled (which necessarily excludes Twin Caves and Laberinto de las Tarantulas). Actun Chapat again provides a case in point. Although hardwoods collectively outweigh pine at Actun Chapat, pine was found in all deposits, whereas the most common hardwood species were recovered from 50 percent of deposits sampled. At Actun Halal, 63 percent of sampled deposits contained pine charcoal, but no hardwood species were found in more than one sampled context (n = 16). At Bar- ton Creek Cave, 73 percent of deposits sampled contained pine, though the most abundant hard-</page><page sequence="8">262 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 16, No. 3, 2005 Warrie Creek Nim Li Punit • Xnaheb 10 km Lubaantun 0 Bats'ub/25 Flight Cave KEY • Surface Site Q Cave Site 0 5 Quebrada de Oro Sebaleb Xheton Cave Xbagel Cho'qow Cave Holomi Batz Cave Muklebal Tzul RHF Ek Xux Figure 5.

The most common hardwood taxon from Actun Nak Beh was recovered from 17 percent of deposits, whereas pine, as previously discussed, was found in 100 percent. Interestingly, pine was the only taxa of wood charcoal recovered at Actun Chechem Ha. Paleoethnobotanical investigations at the Chechem Ha consisted mostly of sampling the contents of intact vessels on the cave's ledges, though a single one liter flotation sample from a surface hearth feature in one of the cave's inner tun- nels yielded 93 g of pine charcoal. Overall, the widespread occurrence of pine charcoal from these upper Belize Valley cave sites is likely because the burning of pine was a regular component of ancient Maya cave activities in this region. Investigations in caves utilized during the Clas- sic period in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize have yielded an assemblage of pine remains similar to that recovered from caves in the upper Belize valley (Table 1, Figure 5) (Prufer 2002). Although analysis of these remains is ongoing, some general observations can be made. At Bat- s' ub/ Flight 25 Cave, located on the southwest mar- gin of Belize in the Union Camp area of the Columbia Forest Reserve in Toledo District, over 200 organic artifacts were recovered, including unburned pinewood fragments and pine charcoal. Similar quantities of pine remains were also recov- ered in several caves near the Bladen Branch of the Monkey River, such as Holomi Baatz Cave, Sebaleb Xheton Cave, and Xba' gel Cho' qow Cave. A cluster of the pine remains from Holomi Baatz Cave consists of small stubs of split pinewood that were burned on one end, indicating that they had once been part of a pine torch, and, at Xba' gel Cho' qow Cave, researchers found an intact pine splint, likely a remnant torch, radiocarbon dated to A.D. 430-600, that was embedded in the cave wall but not burned (Figure 6). A similar pine torch frag- ment was discovered in Sebaleb Xheton Cave. In addition to the pine remains from these cave sites, limited documentation of pine remains can be found in site reports and publications on other caves in the Maya Lowlands (Figure 2, Table 1). At Actun Polbilche, in the Sibun River valley of Belize, sixty specimens of pine splints, radiocar- bon dated to A.D. 625, were found (Pendergast 1974:59). Pendergast (1974:59) described the pine specimens from Actun Polbilche as long, narrow splints of wood that were burned on one end, sim- ilar to the pine from Holomi Baatz Cave. The Actun Polbilche pine specimens appeared to have been split from larger pieces of wood, and they may have been bound into bundles to be used as torches. Else- where in the Sibun River valley, pine splints, inter-</page><page sequence="9">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 263 Pine splint Figure 6. Pine torch fragmented embedded in cave wall at Xba'qe1 Cho'qow Cave. preted as torch remnants, were discovered in Tiger Bay Cave (Graham et al. 1980:169), Footprint Cave (Stone 1997:201), and Caves Branch Cave (Reents- Budet and MacLeod 1997:58). In the upper Belize valley, Gann (1925:111) reportedly found a bun- dle of pine sticks in a cave near Benque Viejo, Belize, though the site's location is not specified, and an item identified as a pine torch was found at Uchentzub (Graham et al. 1980:169). At Naj Tunich, in Peten, Guatemala, a torch fragment was recovered but not analyzed (Brady 1989:289-290). With the exception of the pine remains from Actun Polbiche, however, it is uncertain if any of these remains were identified by a trained archaeob- otanist. Pine from Ritual and Nonritual Contexts at Surface Sites The majority of information on the use of pine by the ancient Maya comes from wood charcoal recov- ered from surface sites. Pine remains have been recovered in abundance from surface sites with occupations dating from the Early Formative period to the Colonial period (ca. 1100 B.C.—A.D. 1600) (Lentz 1989, 1991, 1994, 1999; Lentz et a1.1996; Lentz et al. 1997; Miksicek 1983, 1988, 1991; Morehart 2001a, 2003; Wiesen and Lentz 1999). These studies have revealed that pine was widely used throughout Maya prehistory. Unfortunately, many of these reports do not pro- vide functional descriptions of contexts from which archaeobotanical remains were derived, focusing instead on wider sociospatial and temporal contexts or simple lists of identified flora. Nevertheless, functional information on pine-yielding contexts is available for a handful of sites. These studies indi- cate that pinewood was used for a variety of eco- nomic pursuits, including fuel and construction materials. At Copan, Honduras, for example, pine charcoal predominates throughout the site's For- mative period to Late Classic period occupation in middens, hearths, activity surfaces, construction collapse, and post molds (Lentz 1991:280), and at Yarumela, Honduras, pine was found in Formative period fire pits, construction collapse, middens, and</page><page sequence="10">264 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 16, No. 3, 2005 as a preserved post in a Late Formative period struc- ture (Lentz et al. 1997:70). Similarly, pine charcoal from Ceren, El Salvador, a site that was buried by volcanic ash following the eruption of the Loma Caldera volcano, may represent the remnants of a burned roof beam that collapsed following the vol- cano's eruption (Lentz et al. 1996:257). At Pook's Hill, a small, high-status residential site in the Roar- ing Creek Valley of western Belize, pine charcoal was identified in Late to Terminal Classic period middens and from above and beneath floors (More- hart 2001a:Table 1). Information on the ritual deposition of pine and other flora at surface sites is not abundant. The lack of data on plant remains from ceremonial contexts likely reflects the minimal archaeobotanical inves- tigations undertaken in the Maya Lowlands, the fact that most projects employ archaeobotanical approaches to understand ancient subsistence pat- terns and environmental conditions rather than rit- ual practices, and the limited number of paleoethnobotanical reports that provide functional information on archaeological contexts. Thus, the archaeobotanical record is incomplete, and ritually deposited plant remains are severely underrepre- sented. The occurrence of pine remains in ceremonial contexts, while limited, suggests that pine use was widespread during ritual practices at surface sites (Figure 1, Table 1), reinforcing the significance of pine from the cave sites discussed above. In Hon- duras, pine charcoal was recovered from both caches and tombs at Copan (Lentz 1991:Table 1), and pine charcoal was found in subaltar caches and grave offerings from sites in the El Cajon region (Lentz 1989:197). Chase and Chase (1998:317) reported pine needles from a cache in Structure A6 at Caracol in the Vaca Plateau of western Belize, and excavations in a throne room in the southern acropolis at La Milpa, located in northwest Belize, recovered pine charcoal in association with a ter- mination ritual (Hammond et al. 2000:43). Cere- monial contexts at Xunantunich and nearby sites also contained pine remains (Lentz et al. 2003). Fur- thermore, pine charcoal was found in three burials at Pook's Hill, which is not far from the Roaring Creek Valley caves discussed previously (More- hart 2001a). The Pook's Hill burial data demon- strate that pine was burned during ritual activities at both surface and cave sites in the Roaring Creek Valley. Farther from the Maya region, in Oaxaca, researchers found burned pine cones in burials and other ceremonial contexts at the Formative period site, Fabrica San Jose (Ford 1976:266), suggesting that pine was symbolically valued over a wide dis- tance in Mesoamerican antiquity. Utilitarian and Ritual Use of Pine by the Modern Maya The modern Maya of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras use species of pine for numerous util- itarian purposes. The Tzeltal Maya of highland Chiapas use pinewood to construct their homes and to build household items such as chairs, doors, and beds (Berlin et al. 1974:299). The Tzotzil Maya, from nearby Zinacantan, use pinewood for main house posts, wall poles, lintels, doors, tables, chests, and to make musical instruments (Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:183-184). The Kekchi and Mopan Maya of southern Belize also use pine for timber (Thompson 1930:34). The flammability of chemical compounds pro- duced in the resin ducts of pinewood and needles, such as volatile oils and terpenes, makes pine an excellent, though smoky, source of fuel. The wood is used for kindling and torches, and the resin, or pitch, can be collected for similar purposes. In the Maya highlands, the resinous heart of pine, cahal tah, serves as the primary light source in most Tzeltal Maya homes (Berlin et al. 1974:299; Met- zger and Williams 1966:396). Pine is equally val- ued for fuel and torches by several other modern Maya groups in both the highlands and lowlands (e.g., Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999:Table 2.2; Breedlove and Hopkins 1971:122; Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:183-184; Laughlin 1975:341; Oakes 1951:47; Watanabe 1992:33; Wisdom 1940:21). Pine is a common component of ceremonial paraphernalia among many modern Maya groups. The Tzotzil believe that pine is one of the most sig- nificant ritual plants (Vogt 1976:6; Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:183-184; Laughlin 1975:341). The Tzotzil attribute pines to the domain te'tik, trees or forest, thereby associating pine with the wild and undomesticated realm of nature (Vogt 1976:6). Pine needles, known as shak toh, are placed along the bases of crosses as well as over floors during var- ious rites. Vogt states that If] or proper communi-</page><page sequence="11">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 265 cation with the supernaturals, people must stand or kneel on Shak Toh" (Vogt 1969:393). The Tzotzil also attach pine boughs to the crosses that are erected on sacred shrines. These cross-shrines are believed to be "doorways" to the houses of earth deities and ancestors (Vogt 1976:6). The Tzeltal, K'iche' , Kaqchikel, and Tz' utujil Maya have sim- ilar practices involving pine (Berlin et al. 1974:299; Brown 2002, 2004; Tedlock 1982:65). Pine nee- dles and boughs also are used to adorn house altars (Deal 1988:Table 15). The tapped resin and the resinous wood of pine are used also for incense. When burned, the com- bustion of volatile oils and terpenes creates a pleas- ant aroma. In the Maya region and throughout Mesoamerica, incense is a standard element of reli- gious paraphernalia (Stross 1997). The smoke from burning incense is often considered an offering to be consumed by deities and ancestors. The Lacan- don believe that as the incense burns it transforms into tortillas for the gods to eat (McGee 1990:44), and the Tzotzil consider burning incense to be cig- arettes for the deities (Vogt 1976:49). Most Mesoamerican groups make incense from the sap of trees in the Burseraceae family, particularly species of Bursera and Protium (Barrera Mann et al. 1976:309; Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:179; Roys 1931:277; Stross 1997). Some Maya groups, however, use pine resin as the principal ingredient in incense (Case et al. 2003; Tripplett 1999), such as the Itzaj (Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999:Table 2.2) and the Lacandon (McGee 1990:44). The Lacan- don pound the pine resin into a paste and store it in god houses, thatched roofed huts that are loci for rituals and storages places for ritual objects. Splints of pine can be purchased at local markets in Mesoamerica to kindle incense; the resinous qual- ity of the pine splints contributes to the overall smell and effect of the incense. Discussion The common recovery of pine remains from cave sites in the Maya Lowlands, in conjunction with pine remains from ceremonial contexts at several surface sites, is evidence that pine was a common component of ancient Maya ritual assemblages. Earlier archaeobotanical studies have addressed only pine's role as a utilitarian resource, but the cer- emonial use of the cave sites suggests that burning pine served a more specific ritual function during cave activities. Furthermore, though the distribu- tion of pine charcoal at surface sites supports that pine was valued for utilitarian purposes, the com- mon recovery of pine remains from ceremonial contexts, such as caches and burials, reinforces the notion that there was a ritual dimension to pine's utilization. Previous explanations of the occurrence of pine at caves have reflected the utilitarian focus of archaeobotanical studies, and no explanation of pine from ceremonial deposits at surface sites has yet been proposed. Pine remains from caves have been interpreted as the remnants of torches, stress- ing the need for lighting during cave activities (Gra- ham et al. 1980:169; Pendergast 1974:59; Stone 1997:201). This conclusion has been reinforced by the frequent discovery of pottery torch holders, which may have held pinewood, from many cave sites in the Maya Lowlands (Brady 1989:257-258; Graham et al. 1980:169; Reents-Budet and MacLeod 1997:58; Stone 1995:14, 1997:201). One exception to the utilitarian view of torches in caves is Stone's brief discussion of the role of torches during possible katun-ending rites at Joloniel Cave, also called Jolja' Cave, located in Chiapas, Mexico. "On one level, the torch provides necessary illumination....On another level, the torch, as fire, may refer to an important component of the ceremony" (Stone 1989:330). True, burning torches satisfied a basic requirement for illumina- tion when undertaking activities within the dark recesses of caves. But pine torches were one of sev- eral elements of Maya ritual paraphernalia, and their symbolic attributes should be considered. Ethnohistoric accounts have documented the burning and offering of pine torches in caves. Seventeenth-century documents written by Span- ish friars Bartolome de Fuensalida, Juan de Orbita, and Joseph Delgado recorded that the Manche Chol Maya of Belize offered pine torches as ritual offer- ings in caves (Thompson 1988:46), and the eighteenth-century residents of San Andres Lar- rainzar, in Chiapas, Mexico, left offerings of pine branches in caves (Sanmiguel 1994:166). The Popul Vuh, the Quiche Maya book of cre- ation, provides an account of the significance of burning torches in caves (Tedlock 1985:112-113, 137). The Lords of Xibalba subject the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, to a series of trials. The</page><page sequence="12">266 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 16, No. 3, 2005 first trial, which their fathers had failed, took place in an underworld realm called the "Dark House." The Lords of Xibalba gave the mythological fig- ures cigars and a single burning torch with the instruction that they must be returned in the morn- ing unfinished. They were not tricked by the Xibal- ban lords, however. They put the tail feathers of the macaw on the torch and fireflies on the cigars to imitate fire, and the Hero Twins successfully passed the underworld trial. Ethnographic information from the Maya high- lands reveals an interesting relationship between the prehistoric ceremonial burning of pine torches and the modern use of candles. Among the Tzotzil Maya, the general term for pine is toj (Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:182-183), which corresponds to the Tzeltal name, tah (Berlin et al. 1974:299). During Tzotzil ritual speech, candles are referred to as "j-sil yo jtoj, j-sil yo jkantela, a splinter of my lowly [pine] torch, a shaving of my humble can- dle" (Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:183). Similar prayers occur in several other Tzotzil ceremonies (Vogt 1976), revealing that candles and pine torches are rendered as semantically parallel sets of things by highland Maya groups. This relationship between pine and candles is possibly because pine torches are an ancient analogue to the modern day use of candles (see, e.g., Bassie-Sweet [2002:180-181]; Vogt [1976:105] for similar obser- vations). Torch motifs are common in Classic Maya iconographic and hieroglyphic assemblages. The Classic Maya sign for TAJ is a flaming torch (Fig- ure 7) (Coe and Van Stone 2001:165), stressing continuity in the association of pine and torches from the Classic period to modern times. Classic period iconographic representations of torches are numerous, such as Stela 35 at Naranjo and Lintel 24 at Yaxchilan, Mexico (Martin and Grube 2000:82, 125), and the widespread depictions of torches reinforces their significance (Schele and Miller 1983; Stuart 1998). Early Classic period paintings from Jolja' Cave, in Chiapas, Mexico (Bassie-Sweet et al. 2000; Stone 1989:322), depict the use of such torches during cave rituals (Figure 8), supporting the interpretation that pine remains from the cave sites are the remnants of torches. Bishop Diego de Landa described similar uses of bundled torches during new fire ceremonies by the sixteenth-century Yucatec Maya. During the month TAJ Figure 7. Classic Maya sign for taj represented as a burn- ing pine torch. Mak, a new fire rite was undertaken in honor of rain and agricultural gods in which "Whey placed in the middle [of the court] a great faggot of dry sticks tied together and set upright, and first burning some of their incense in the brazier they set fire to the sticks" (Tozzer 1941:163). New or virgin fire rites are still practiced by the modern Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Mexico (McGee 1990:53; Tozzer 1941:259) where they are lit to kindle incense and to purify paraphernalia used during ceremonies. The Wastek Maya use similar sticks of pine branches, known as pithomlaab, during curing rites (Alcorn 1984:228, 229, 913). Candles are standard paraphernalia in the ritual assemblages among many modern Maya groups. The Yucatec Maya believe that melting candle wax is itz, a holy substance or "cosmic sap" (Freidel et al. 1993:210), a belief that may have extended to the copious resin of pinewood during precolumbian Maya society. Today, candles are often burned as offerings in caves, perhaps replacing the role of torches in ancient times. Houston and Taube (2000:265-273) and Taube (2002:7) have argued that the smoke produced from such burned offer- ings was linked with the fragrance of flowers in ancient times. The words for candle and flower in many Mayan languages, such as Chol (Josserand</page><page sequence="13">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 267 Figure 8. Early Classic period painting at Jolja Cave, Chiapas, Mexico, showing ritual practitioners holding a burning torch. Courtesy of Karen Bassie-Sweet.</page><page sequence="14">268 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 16, No. 3, 2005 and Hopkins 1996), are related: flowers are called nich, and candles are referred to as nichim. The Tzotzil call flowers nich as well (Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:278), and nichim functions as a gen- eral term for all ritual plants (Vogt 1969:392-394, 1976:216), including pines. For instance, the Tzotzil consider the tips of certain pine species "flowers" during curing rites (Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:184; Laughlin 1975:341; Vogt 1976:66), stressing interrelated symbolism involv- ing pine, candles, and flowers. The ancient burning of pine torches can be inter- preted as symbolic food offerings based on further ethnographic accounts of the significance of can- dles. Modern highland Maya groups refer to can- dles as sacrificial food for the deities. Candles can symbolize animal meat and human sacrifice (Vogt 1976:46-50). White candles have associations with maize and tortillas for the Tzotzil Maya; they are "tortillas for the gods" (Vogt 1976:50, cf. Watan- abe 1992:76). The Tzotzil Maya place or "plant" candles in the ground in a manner reminiscent of a farmer planting maize, creating a circular network of symbols: "tortillas are made from maize; maize grows with the heat provided by the sun; candles produce heat energy—hence the symbolic relation of tortilla-maize-candle" (Vogt 1976:50). Further- more, the Tzotzil refer to P. michoacana Martinez, a sizeable tree that produces large cones, as ajan toj, "ear of corn tree" (Breedlove and Laughlin 1993:184). Interestingly, this tree is one of the sev- eral pines whose tips are considered flowers dur- ing the Tzotzil curing rites just mentioned, a fact that reinforces the relationship between pine, can- dles, flowers, and, ultimately, maize. It is doubtful that all the pine remains from cave sites and ceremonial contexts at surface sites are the remnants of torches. Although several pine specimens from caves in the southern Maya Moun- tains appear to have been used as torches, clusters of pine charcoal were found at Xba' gel Cho'qow Cave that Prufer (2002) interprets as the byprod- uct of wood used to kindle incense, a practice of modern Maya groups. Many of the pine remains from caves in the upper Belize valley were too frag- mentary to determine absolutely whether they were used as torches or as kindling, though it is likely that they were used for both at different times and places (Morehart 2002b). The surface feature at Actun Chechem Ha that yielded 93 g of pine frag- ments was associated with Late Classic period ceramics with carbonized residues, possibly incense, adhering to the interiors, which suggests that the pine was used to kindle incense. Further- more, a number of charred residue samples from Barton Creek Cave, Actun Nak Beh, and Actun Chechem Ha were subjected to chemical analysis, revealing chemical compounds similar to those found in pine (Morehart 2002b). This finding, while inconclusive, may indicate that pine resin itself was used for incense at these caves. Limited information on the characteristics of some pine remains from ceremonial contexts at surface sites reinforces the notion that the ritual use of pine was not restricted to torches. Lentz observed that the pine charcoal from a termination deposit at La Milpa (Hammond et al. 2000:43) was retrieved from an incense brazier. The possible pine needles from a cache at Caracol (Chase and Chase 1998:317) are suggestive of modem Maya practices of using pine needles as a component of ritual para- phernalia. The association between the act of burning, whether candles, incense, or pine torches, and food offerings, particularly maize, is common for many types of rites (Brown 2004; Stuart 1998; Taube 1989:38; 1998:446; Vogt 1969, 1976; Wagley 1949:69). The flower-like aroma of the smoke from such burned offerings represented the "breath-soul" of the offering (Houston and Taube 2000:267; Taube 2002:7-10). In order for the deities to con- sume an offering's "soul," it first had to be converted to its spiritual, fragrant essence via fire. Apparently this concept was not restricted to symbolic food offerings, like pine, but also included genuine food offerings, such as domesticated plants. Unprocessed, charred maize remains, for example, have been recovered from ceremonial contexts at caves and surface sites (Brady 1989:97; Brady 1995:34; Brady et al. 1997:95; Lentz 1991:272; Morehart 2002b), suggesting that ancient Maya rit- ual practitioners were attempting to release the offerings' inner souls with fire. The act of burning such offerings not only allowed ritual practitioners to "feed" the gods, but it also facilitated communication with the deities (Houston and Taube 2000:271-273; Stuart 1998; Taube 2002:10-11; Vogt 1976:207); they were "things for praying to god" (Watanabe 1992:191). The smoke represented both the essence of the</page><page sequence="15">Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer] WOOD OF THE GODS 269 offering and the "speech" of the deities, which explains why many prehistoric, anthropomorphic censers have a mouth to allow the smoke from the incense to flow out (Houston and Taube 2000:271). The widespread occurrence of pine remains from ceremonial contexts at both surface and cave sites suggests that the Maya may have used a basic formula of ritual paraphernalia, which included pine, regardless of the type of rite. Ethnographers have long recognized the high degree of similarity and overlap in the material components of Maya rituals. For example, Redfield and Villa Rojas (1934:128) observed among the Yucatec of Chan Kom that, "the resemblances among the different ceremonies are so great that, in describing one in detail, one describes much that occurs in many or even all of the others," an observation also made by Love and Peraza Castillo (1984:282). Most dis- tinctions between different kinds of Maya rituals are found in the prayers, songs and music, and the ceremonial habits or preferences of individual rit- ual practitioners (Alcorn 1984:199; Love and Per- aza Castillo 1984:282; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934:128); "material objects and their arrangement are only part of the offering because it is speech that ultimately defines and achieves the purposes of the offering" (Alcorn 1984:199). Although similarities in archaeological assem- blages among diverse types of ceremonial contexts, such as pine charcoal from caves and from burials and caches at surface sites, pose methodological limitations in using archaeological data to infer dif- ferences in ancient ritual activities, such similari- ties are also revealing. Widespread commonalities in archaeobotanical assemblages from diverse rit- ual contexts suggest a tradition of shared under- standings on the symbolism surrounding certain plants and of collective knowledge of ritual behav- ior (Morehart 2002b). The use of such shared sym- bols was a significant means for maintaining (at least the semblance of) a collective identity that could crosscut social, economic, and political divi- sions and was, ultimately, necessary to validate rit- ual performances. Indeed, all ritual is composed of invariable and variable features (Rappaport 1979), and the replication of invariable aspects of ritual may reinforce the legitimacy of variability. The negotiation—often strategic—between invariabil- ity and variability is particularly critical in those settings in which ritual confers social power. Although the same basic symbolic components of ritual experience may have been employed irre- spective of the social positions of practitioners and perhaps regardless of a rite's immediate goal, this practice, above all, suggests that certain key sym- bolic themes, particularly those of "feeding" sanc- tified entities, were closely integrated into the rituals undertaken in many social contexts. As vehicles for this symbolism, plants, such as pine, were essen- tial components in ancient Maya rituals that served to legitimize and empower all ceremonial activity. Conclusions The common distribution of pine remains in sacred cave sites as well as in ceremonial deposits at sur- face sites suggests that pine was a component of prehistoric Maya ritual paraphernalia. Framing interpretations of such pine remains with informa- tion contained in the ethnographic, ethnohistoric, iconographic, and epigraphic records of the Maya enriches our understanding of the role of pine in ancient Maya ritual life and provides support for the notion that symbolism surrounded the use of pine during ritual activities. One set of associations we explored relates the burning of pine, particu- larly pine torches, with a symbolic complex of offering "food" sacrifices to deities, proposing that the role of pine torches in the past may have been similar to the modern-day ceremonial use of can- dles. We believe that these symbolic features were inseparable from utilitarian concerns for quality fuel wood. Furthermore, the widespread recovery of pine remains from diverse ceremonial contexts raises the possibility that pine was a basic element of ritual paraphernalia for many different types of ritual practices; the burning of pine may have been an essential, symbolic act necessary to establish the validity of ritual performances.

It is perhaps useful not to conceptualize these relation- ships only as one in which plants are seen as metaphors that simply reflect or contrast with social relations, emphasizing a duality between humans and the natural world. Rather, as ani- mated entities, humans and plants can exist in a "single social field" (Rival 1993:635). Perceptions of the complex relation- ship between the social and the natural develop as a practical knowledge through the active engagement of humans with their natural world (Bloch 1992; Hastrup 1989; Rival 1993, 1998).</page><page sequence="20">274 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 16, No. 3, 2005] 2. These are hot and cold qualities that are attributed to social phenomena and physical entities. See Furst (1995) and Lopez Austin (1988) for arguments that this distinction is indigenous to Mesoamerican cultures rather than the product of European influence. 3. For purposes of standardization, measurements are from charcoal recovered from one liter flotation samples, a method that yielded 14.09 g of charcoal. If charcoal collected through other means is considered, the total charcoal weight is 30.43 g. However, the difference between pine and hard- wood charcoal remains virtually unchanged with the addition of these data; 97 percent of the charcoal is from hardwoods and 3 percent is from pine.
