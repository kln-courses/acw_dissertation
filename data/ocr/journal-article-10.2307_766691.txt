Moutier Saint-Jean. XIIth century, end of the first quarter. Limestone. Given by the Friends of the Fogg Museum. Three narrative and nine foliate capitals from Moltier Saint-Jean, the oldest Benedictine abbey in Burgundy, were acquired by A. Kingsley Porter from the dealer Demotte in 1922. Another foliate capital and a waterspout, found in Avallon by Paul Sachs, were added to the collection three years later. The thirteen capitals, permanently installed in a newly refurbished setting, constitute one of the most im- posing ensembles of Romanesque carving outside of France. Little remains of the monastery founded by the fifth-cen- tury cenobite Johannes and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. An eleventh-century copy of a charter supposedly granted by Clovis exists nearby in the library at Semur-en-Auxois (published in E. Perard, Recueil de plusieurs pieces curieus- es servant a I'histoire de Bourgogne, Paris, 1664, pp. 1-2). Under a twelfth-century abbot, Bernard II (1109-1133), the holdings of the monastery were greatly expanded and the abbey, which lay near a stream called the Reome, was re- stored ("Bernardus reomaensem ecclesiam renovavit a fun- damentis." P. Roverius, Reomaus; seu historia monasterii S loannis Reomaensis in tractur lingonensi, Paris, 1637, p. 190). An engraving of 1689 shows a typical monastic con- glomeration, dominated by a church of the Latin Cross type with a rounded apse and crossing tower (L. Courajod, Le Monasticon Gallicanum, Paris, 1869, pl. 41). In the view, each of the seven bays in the nave and the three bays to the east of the slightly projecting transept are pierced by three clerestory windows. A single window lights the lower aisle wall. The arrangement shown corresponds to that employ- ed at Cluny and copied at Paray-le-Monial before the col- lapse of the nave vault of the former church in 1125. In con- trast, a modified system, in which single sources of light punctuate the high walls of a somber nave, was used shortly thereafter at Autun in possible reaction to the recent dis- aster at Cluny (D. Grivot and G. Zarnecki, Gislebertus, sculpteur d'Autun, 2nd ed., Paris, 1965, p. 163). By 1636, when Moitier was joined to the Congregation of St. Maur, the church was already dilapidated. In 1797, the abbey was bought for use as a quarry over the protests of the towns- people who, as early as 1791, had petitioned the depart- mental authorities not to sell the church. Whatever remains of the abbey is presently occupied by a farmer (A. Vittenet, L'abbaye de Moutier-Saint-Jean; Essai historique, Macon, 1938; W. R. Tyler, The History of Moutier-Saint-Jean [1939], typescript, Fogg Museum Library). Several capitals, apart from those in the Fogg, have sur- vived the destruction of the church and exist in France. A de- lightful one in the Louvre displays three vintners busily at work cutting, carrying, stomping and pouring; a second less celebrated capital in Paris has large medallions containing a fantastic animal or a rosette on each of its three faces (M. Aubert and M. Beaulieu, Description raisonnge des sculp- tures du moyen age, I, Paris, 1950, Nos. 25 and 26, pp. 37ff). Sculptures still in the environs of Moiutier have been mentioned briefly in the literature (J. Masson-Bayle, "La sculpture romane en Cote-d'Or," Positions des theses des eleves de l'Ecole du Louvre, 1944-1952, Paris, 1956, II, 119); photographs of several capitals in the region were commu- nicated to the Fogg by Yves Peyre (Correspondence, Aug- ust-September 1969). Neil Stratford generously made avail- able his own photos of these and other works together with his notes on their dimensions and exact locations. A diminutive capital with a symmetrical arrangement of leaves, now in the collection of the present tenant of the site of the abbey and two others, one with busts of angels and another showing a lamb against foliage (both in the collection of General Altemeyer at Bard-les-Epoisses a few kilometers away), are distinguished from the series of nave capitals in the Fogg and the Louvre by their size and style. Five foliate capitals in the vicinity of the abbey are close in design and identical in size to those in the Fogg and are dis- cussed along with them below. Two fragments of capitals, one with architectural elements and one foliate, have re- cently been discovered in the park of the ch^ateau at Bard- les-Epoisses, where the Vintage capital in the Louvre had also been found (Memoires de la Commission des Antiqui- tes du Departement de la Cote-d'Or, XXVI, 1963-1969, pp. 121-123, figs. 23, 23bis). Among the pieces in American collections, only a frag- ment with a half-length figure of an angel in the Cloisters, New York, has been convincingly linked to the Moitier sculptures. Similarities in the handling of drapery and facial type were discussed by Stephen Scher in The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (Catalogue of an Exhibition held at the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, May 8 - June 22, 1969, p. 35). Although the broken face of a small capital at Williams College, on which addorsing birds peck at grapes, is similar in composition to the diminutive leaf cap- 59</page><page sequence="2">ital still at Moutier mentioned above, its carving lacks the vi- tality and variety found in sculptures known to have come from the abbey (cf. W. Cahn, "Romanesque Sculpture in American Collections. III. New England University Muse- ums," Gesta, VIII, 1969, pp. 60-61). The attribution to Mou- tier of two isolated broken figures in private collections can- not be accepted despite the fact that drapery conventions corresponding to those found on the figures of Elizabeth and her companion on the Fogg Zachariah capital reappear on the figures. Questions concerning the original function of both fragments need to be clarified (Alumni Treasures; Phil- lips Academy, Andover, 1967, No. 337, p. 99; Judaica and Medieval and Renaissance Art; Collection of Dr. S. Zalman Yovely, Sale Catalogue, Parke Bernet, March 17, 1955, No. 207, p. 50). Walter Cahn has called to my attention a frag- ment of a bas-relief, present whereabouts unknown, on which an angel with a censer is shown acclaiming two joy- ous souls. Although the piece is said to have come from Mouftier, it is virtually identical to the central group in the lefthand part of the Autun lintel, except for the object the angel holds (Gislebertus, pl. A; Rare Judaica .. ., Sale Cata- logue, Parke Bernet, February 24, 1956, No. 444, p. 96). De- tails of the lion-shaped waterspout Sachs acquired for the Fogg (1925.9.2) recall in a subtle way the arrangement of elements on foliate capitals from Moftier. But the coy pose of the whimsical beast as well as questions about its func- tion cast doubt on the plausibility of the spindly-limbed animated gutter. Twenty-two capitals, each of which is about two feet tall, can be attributed to the church at Moutier. All are carved in limestone and are well-preserved despite the effects of ex- posure revealed in occasional surface abrasion and the ap- pearance of lichen. Fifteen capitals belonged to engaged col- umns while seven came from pilasters (five of these are in the Fogg, two are still at Moutier). This division suggests an architectural arrangement similar to that used at Cluny or at Paray-le-Monial in which pilasters were addorsed to piers on the nave side while engaged columns were used on the remaining three sides (Foto Marburg 40842). The dis- tribution of subject matter among the carvings is equally in- teresting and may help to modify this proposed reconstruc- tion: column capitals are decorated with varied vegetal orn- amentation and with the narrative scenes of the vintage and Zachariah; pilaster capitals carry repetitive Corinthian-de- rived designs in addition to the commanding didactic repre- sentations of Cain and Abel and the Journey to Emmaus. In the north side of the choir at Autun, a similar Emmaus carving is prominently placed along with three sober Corin- thian capitals reminiscent of the pilaster decoration from Moutier (Gislebertus, plan VI and pls. 2, 58, 62, 63). This relationship leads to the suggestion that all the surviving pilaster reliefs from Moiutier may have come from the east end of the church (cf. Charite-sur-Loire, Foto Marburg 170560) without negating the earlier remark concerning the variety of supports in the nave. A "Moultier Master" was identified by Zarnecki as an as- sistant to Gislebertus at Autun. Two reasons were given for the attribution to him of the adjacent, undistinguished cap- itals in the nave of St.-Lazare representing Samson and the Washing of the Feet (Gislebertus, pls. 29, 31 and p. 75). The observation that foliate elements appearing in the back- ground of the Washing scene are similar to forms on one of the Fogg capitals acknowledges only that some standard features of composite capitals are unimaginatively used in both carvings. In fact, the cramped effect of the Autun sculp- ture is foreign to work from Moultier where the surviving capitals are boldly conceived and sparingly executed. The second decisive factor in Zarnecki's identification of hands was the similarity between the representations of the Jour- ney to Emmaus (Gislebertus, pp. 65-66 and pls. B1 and B2). Indeed, in this instance, the dependence of Moultier on Aut- un for the compositional scheme seems likely. Awkward as- pects of the Fogg capital, such as the overlapping of the fig- ures, their stiff postures, discrepancies in size and illogical or contradictory drapery systems, can best be understood as consequences of a naive attempt to adapt a composition from a cylindrical drum to a flat surface. But the treatment of the forms and the interpretation of narrative betray a thoroughly different mentality. The Moiu- tier figures are palpable, their heads large, their postures vigorous and stable and their anatomy emphatic. It is not difficult to identify the event depicted because of the emp- hasis on mundane aspects of the narrative and the sequent- ial manner in which the forms are arranged. In contrast, the Autun figures are attenuated, linear abstractions that in- teract ecstatically in ambiguous, ornamental surroundings. Despite the divergent styles exhibited by the sculptures at Moultier (e.g., Cain and Abel), the use of volumetric, organ- ic forms, literally described, distinguishes the entire extant oeuvre. 60</page><page sequence="3">Sources for both the foliate and the figurative motifs used at MoOtier can be found either among the sculptures still in situ in the transept at Cluny or amidst the debris unearthed by J. K. Conant and preserved in the Mus6e Ochier. Simple robust designs with large, flat, vertical leaves and pendant fruit, thick trunks with branches linked by entwined flower- ing stems and detailed arrangements of over-lapping leaves, stalks and volutes abound in Cluniac work (K. J. Conant, "Mediaeval Academy Excavations at Cluny, III, Speculum, IV, 1929, pl. IV, C115; pl. VI, C137, C141; pl. V, C133; pl. III, C107; pls. I, II). In addition, peculiarities observed at Moutier, such as the appearance of masks at the source of a foliate spray or the application of isolated enframed fleurons against the leafy drum, exist on sculptures from Cluny (Fo- to Marburg 35755 and K. J. Conant, Cluny; les eglises et la maison du chef d'ordre, Macon, 1968, fig. 224). Most striking of all, the heart-shaped units of leaf and thistle found on the beautiful Moutier "arum" capital (.25), juxtaposed by Zar- necki with an elegant attenuated one from Autun (Gisle- bertus, pl. B7 and B8), reappear in an identical arrangement and with comparable elan on a fragment found by Conant during his excavations in Cluny at a house near the railroad station (Cluny, fig. 183 and conversation, March 1972). Comparable evidence for the figural work similarly points to Cluniac contacts. Although Pierre Quarre correctly differ- entiated the style of the Moutier capitals with Cain and Abel and the Winemakers from that showing the Emmaus scene, it was unnecessary for him to seek equivalents for the for- mer in Languedoc ("Les apports languedociens et rhodaniens dans la sculpture romane de Bourgogne," Bulletin du Centre international d'Etudes romanes, 1965, p. 37 and n. 9bis). As he remarked in a note, Cluny, especially the tympanum sculpture, provides ample instances of thickly banded drap- ery combined with interest in anatomical structure (cf. Con- ant, Cluny, fig. 203). According to Zarnecki's reconstruction, Gislebertus was trained at Cluny and at Vezelay before arriving at Autun ca. 1125. By 1131 or 32, Zarnecki hypothesizes, work on St.- Lazare could have progressed as far as the fourth pier in the nave and at this point, Gislebertus' assistant, the sculptor of the Samson and Washing of the Feet capitals located there, could have left to work at Moutier (Gislebertus, pp. 166- 178). But the single compelling link between Autun and Moutier, the Emmaus carving, lies further to the east. It could have been put in place soon after work was begun in the apse of Autun early in the 1120's. This observation, in addition to the striking connections revealed in analyses of the carvings that link Moutier to Cluny, indicates a probable date in the mid 1120's for the restoration of the abbey church at Moitier and the execution of its sculpture.

Moutier Saint-Jean, XIIth century, end of the first quar- ter. a. The Annunciation to Zachariah in the Temple; Eliza- beth andJohn (?). Capitalfrom an engaged column. H. 25", W. (top) 24 1/2", D. 23" (block, top; 14" carved) No. 1922.19. Fig. 1. A tri-partite architectural structure, the equivalent of a "bay", encompasses the narrative and eases the transitions between sides and levels on this bell-shaped capital. On the main face, an angel, wings overlapping a billeted archivolt, stands immobile before the figure of a long haired, bearded man originally shown swinging a censer over an altar. At the left, beneath a similar archivolt, an awkward and aged woman converses with a youthful male dressed in a tunic and cape. A crenelated tower, with a diminutive bell-ringer stan- ding in an arched opening, accents the right angle and is extended around the side by a representation of the exterior of two bays of a lower structure; a hooded workman and a demon are seen above. Incised into the uncarved portion of the block behind the simulated architecture is a small four- lobed rosette, possibly a placement mark. The subject of the main representation is based on Luke I: 8-20, Gabriel's Annunciation to Zachariah in the Temple that his wife Elizabeth will bear a son. The figures on the left, identified by A. K. Porter as Elizabeth "accompanied by a handmaiden or possibly a youth," ("Romanesque Capitals," p. 27), may represent Elizabeth and the young John, perhaps in hiding, an event described in the Protoevangelium of St. James XXII:3 (M. R. James, The Apocryphal New Testa- ment, Rev. ed., Oxford, 1953, p. 48; cf. the discussion by Adelheid Heimann, "The Capital Frieze and Pilasters of the Portail Royal at Chartres," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XXXI, 1968, p. 81). The architectural frame is similar to that employed at Autun on the St. Peter capital (Gislebertus, pl. 33a) although no comparable sense of figural movement is achieved. At each level the Moutier sculptor's approach to the problem of space seems to change: jeweled edges and folds bring the draperies together on the surface of the drum while the po- sition of the feet and the three-quarter pose of the shoulders thrust the extremities of the figures deep within the struc- ture. The fully modelled winsome heads contrast with the linear bodies and leap out beyond the frame. An inquisitive air, created by pointed chins, puckered mouths and staring eyes, recalls the expressions on two figured capitals in the small nave of the church at La Rochepot near Beaune (Gis- lebertus, fig. D4, Balaam; an Annunciation is carved on a second capital). Despite short-comings in the handling of the figures, accurate descriptions of texture and occupation provide the carving with strong and original appeal. The characteriza- tion of ball-fringe on the altar cloth, geometric design on a prayer shawl, imbrications in the masonry, recessed frames around windows and the volumetric ornamentation of the two arches provide exceptional and rich visual delight. Ob- servation of architectural detail in Burgundy is exact; the ornamentation of arches simulates that visible on the north transept at Paray (H. Focillon, Art of the West, I: Roman- esque,. London, 1963, pl. 132). Identical decoration is known to have existed at Cluny (cf. the decoration of a choir screen, Cluny, fig. 184) and may have been present at Moutier as well. Corinthian pilasters and triple lights in the upper story were also characteristics of Moutier's own plan. The pre- sence of a cowled workman with a beaded collar shown til- ing the roof, his hammer suspended above him, recalls con- temporary Cistercian representations of laborers (eg., illus- trations in the Moralia in Job, Dijon, Bibl. Mun., 170, III, fol. 75, cutting wheat; St. Gregory on Job, Dijon, Bibl. Mun. 137, fol. 41, cutting down a tree). The whimsical relation of the diminutive bell-ringer, with carefully twisted rope and han- dle, to the demon, seen pulling his own hair at the top, em- phasizes the anecdotal character of the carvings from Mou- tier (cf. also the manuscript illumination in which the hang- ing of Haman is shown, Bible of Stephen Harding, Dijon, Bibl. Mun. 14, fol. 122v. The sequence of occupations por- trayed on this sculpture is reminiscent of that on the wine- makers capital in the Louvre although the execution of that work is closer to that of the Fogg Cain and Abel carving.

Sacrifice of Cain and Abel, inscribed Abel cum primiciis and Cain cum lolio. Capitalfrom a pilaster. H. 26", W. 25" (top; 17 1/2" bottom), D. 23" (18" carvedtop; 5 1/2"bottom). No. 1922.18. Fig. 2. The most celebrated of the Fogg capitals is the one on which the scene of the Sacrifice of Cain and Abel is cere- moniously presented. The moralizing content of this popu- lar theme, which appeared elsewhere in Burgundy during the same period on distinctly narrative capitals at Vezelay, at Chalon-sur-Saone and at Neuilly-en-Donjon, is empha- sized by the inscriptions at the front angles of the abacus and by the symbolic elements placed on the sides behind the protagonists. Beardless, benign Abel genuflects at the left, protecting his uplifted offering with veiled hands. To the right, the bearded profile of a solemn Cain extends, on bent arms, his neatly bound wheat amidst which weeds are carefully distinguished. Above, on the abacus, the mighty hand of God the Father emerges from an undulant cloud pattern; below, a provocative two-headed eagle, overshad- owed by the offerings, functions as an altar for the gifts. FIGURE 2. Sacrifice of Cain and Abel. Moutier Saint-Jean, Xllth century, end of the first quarter. Heaven and the two brothers, the dominant elements in the event recounted in Genesis IV: 3-6, thus form the top and side frames of the inverted trapezoidal face of the cap- ital. The offerings they present animate the rusticated space of the inner field. The only losses on this side are an edge of the drapery with which Abel cloaks the lamb and three fin- ger tips of the great Hand; around on the right, more ex- tensive damage has destroyed the upper torso of the figure shown riding a leonine serpent. The refined, detailed work- manship of the sculpture is, apart from these areas, remark- ably well preserved. A close dependence on Cluniac figurative sculpture is ob- vious. The compact, neat head of Abel, the palpable, logi- cal anatomy of both figures as well as the predilection for form-enhancing draperies with horizontal banding and pro- minent trim at the neck are all reminiscent of fragments ex- cavated by Conant and attributed to the tympanum (Cluny, figs. 192 &amp; 203). Characteristic transformations have occur- red: the smooth, graded planes, crisp incisions and regular shadows of the Cluny carvings are replaced by a variety of robust, irregular forms and a plethora of textural details. The exceptionally tight orchestration of form and content heightens the expressive and didactic value of this Moutier sculpture. Cain's kneeling position is immobilized through its identity with the contour of the capital. Above, the tightly organized inscription, Cain with his tares, abuts his head and is itself impinged upon by the aggressive adjacent cloud pattern. The truncated form of the offering and its abrupt position near the Hand lock Cain at the angle and cut him off from the other figures. In contrast to Cain's earth-bound exclusion, Abel is weightless, buoyed in space by intense concentration on the mighty Hand. His orna- mental halo and drapery add to his prominence and em- phasize his detachment from the ground. The longer in- scription that accompanies him, Abel with his firstlings, is inscribed in ample space and is raised overhead like a triumphant banner. The inscriptions depart from Genesis and present an explanation of the story that is derived from Hebrew and Christian commentary. Whereas Abel was described in the Bible as having selected the fatted sheep of his flock, Cain, it was said, chose only of the fruit of the ground. Jewish wri- ters attributed the rejection of his offering to a reluctant manner and inferior selection (see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, Phila., 1909, I, 107-108). The weeds present in 63</page><page sequence="6">his sheaf and explicitly cited in the inscription above the carving may refer to the weeds said to have grown amidst the good seed in the Parable of the Tares (Matthew XIII: 24-42). A tradition begun by Irenaeus in the second century and continued by Prudentius in the fifth equated sinners and heretics with weeds. Following arguments put forth by Pearl Braude, Cain represented to the Middle Ages the her- etic and the Jew as well as the delinquent Christian ("Cok- kel in oure Clene Corn" Gesta, VII, 1968, pp. 15-28). The comment by the great twelfth century churchman, Peter the Venerable, that "the church of God . . ., by the zealous hands of her husbandmen, roots out the brambles and thorns which are detrimental to the Lord's sowing," (from his Tract against Saracens, cited by J. Kritzeck, Peter the Venerable and Islam, Princeton, 1964, p. 38), provides con- temporary textual support for the interpretation of the forms in the sculpture. Early Christian commentators saw the story of the broth- ers primarily as a confrontation of types: Abel, as the first martyr, was seen as an antetype of Christ; Cain was under- stood as a disciple of the Devil (discussed in P.-H. Michel, "L'iconographie de Cain et Abel," Cahiers de civilization mgdievale, I, 1958, pp. 194ff; see also RMau, Iconographie, II-1, pl. 5 and pp. 94-95). The objects carved on the sides of the capital behind their backs emphasize these natures. The fragmentary figure overcoming the fictitious, scaly-bellied beast is analagous to contemporary representations of Samson or David fighting a lion and, like them, probably signifies the triumph over evil (a lion was juxtaposed be- hind Cain on a contemporary capital from south-western France exhibited at the Cloisters in 1968; C. G6mez-Mor- eno, Medieval Art from Private Collections, New York, 1968, No. 24). The heavily laden tree behind Abel possibly represents the Tree of Life that grew in Paradise. A tree with similar fruit forms the background against which the brothers make their offerings on the capital at Chalon-sur- Saone (Foto Marburg LA778/10); a more schematic tree stands behind Abel with his offering on the bronze doors at San Zeno in Verona (Braude, fig. 3). The Tree of Life was an important element in Jewish Art throughout the Middle Ages where it was often shown accompanied by two birds (Z. Ameisenowa, "The Tree of Life in Jewish Iconography," Journal of the Warburg Institute, II, 1938-39, pp. 329-342). Although no birds perch in the tree behind Abel on the Mofitier capital, the two-headed eagle on the front face, itself a motif common in Near Eastern textiles (D. Jalabert, "De l'art oriental antique a l'art roman," Bul- letin monumental, 194, 1938, pp. 173-176), may be asso- ciated with the vegetal form. A chain of bicephalous eagles decorates an abacus in the cloister at Moissac, the capital of which is adorned with pairs of birds entwined in flowering trees, an ornamental variant on the Jewish theme (Photo James Austin QV 8). The juxtaposition of the motifs on the Moissac sculpture suggests that they are thematically rela- ted. In at least two other instances, the double-headed bird is associated with the punishment of sin. At Vouvant, the winged creature is located just above a representation of the Temptation in the main archivolt on the North portal (Foto Marburg 42710 and 42704). The bird, both heads drinking from chalices, accompanies a representation of St. Michael overcoming the demon in a late eleventh century manu- script from Mont-Saint-Michel (Avranches, Bib. Mun. 50, fol. 1; Art de Basse-Normandie, No. 40, p. 41). The heral- dic two-headed bird at Moutier thus sustains the theme of the triumph over evil in contrast to the demonic tricepha- lous creatures actively pursued on contemporary Burgund- ian capitals at Vezelay, Perrecy-les-Forges, Autun and ori- ginally at Cluny (Gislebertus, pls. B12, 14, 15, 16). On a capital at Chalon-sur-Saone, a heavy, ornamental collar unites the necks of two eagles whose beaks peck at the crowned heads of a man and woman, perhaps in punish- ment (Foto Marburg LA 779/8). The position of the bird on the Mouitier carving suggests that it serves as an altar as well. The location is analagous to that of a bifurcated slender sprout that rises between Cain and Abel on the capital of their Sacrifice at Vezelay (Salet, No. 94, pi. 28). Both elements may relate to the transformation of the setting of the story noted by Michel to have occured early in the XIIth century. A Presentation capital at Autun, which resembles in composition the Mou- tier Cain and Abel work, also includes a foliate sprout placed between two figures offering a church (Gislebertus, pl. 13a and B9; cf. also the ivory carving of Cain and Abel in the Walters Art Gallery No. 71.289, illustration in Arts of the Middle Ages, Boston 1940, No. 127, pl. XXIII). Bibliography: A. K. Porter, "Romanesque Capitals," Figs. 6, 16; Pilgrimage Roads, 11, pl. 66. 64</page><page sequence="7">c. The Journey to Emmaus. Capital from a pilaster. H. 24", W. 24 1/2", D. 23" (14"; 6 1/2" bottom). No. 1922.17. Fig. 3. The presence of staffs identifies the three main figures as pilgrims; since one of them wears a cruciform nimbus and has His hand raised in salutation, it seems likely that the subject is Christ meeting two disciples on the way to Em- maus (Luke XXIV: 13-28). On the left side, an angel is seen hovering above foliage; on the fight; a figure with a horn leans out of a window in an inhabited, locked architectural structure that ornaments the adjacent side. Grivot and Zarnecki used this sculpture to confirm the identification of the representation on the similar capital in the choir at Autun (p. 65). In fact, that work probably served as the inspiration for this one: the curious sizes of the figures, inclined postures and excited draperies, all awk- ward aspects of the Fogg carving, are probably the result of the transference of the Autun figures from a convex surface where they were propped by "air cushions" to a planar one where they are located on a common ground line. Other dis- crepancies in style, more prominent on this sculpture than on any of the others from Moutier, may also relate to the use of a powerful model. The lower parts of both tall figures are too meager for their large heads and broad upper parts; the draperies vacillate between the roles of form-defining, as in the draperies around Christ's legs, and ornamental, as in the confusing cape on the tall disciple that thoroughly conceals the anatomy beneath. Numerous similarities to sculpture from Cluny indicate that the capital at Autun was but a secondary model for the Moutier master. The three-quarter pose and apron folds on the short disciple and Christ derive from those on the figure of God the Father on the Adam and Eve capital (Conant, Cluny, fig. 159). The rolled edges of hair, drilled eyes and broad, sharp-edged facial planes recall the organization of the head of an angel thought to have come from the tympa- FIGURE 3. Journey to Emmaus. Moutier Saint-Jean, XIIth century, end of the first quarter. num at Cluny while beaded, ornamental collars, heavily banded bodices as well as the close cropped beard reappear on another tympanum fragment (Ibid., figs. 193 and 206). Even the foliage beneath the angel, with its long fronds and furled tip, seems to be directly inspired by work at the mo- ther abbey (cf. Fogg No. 1922.16). The diminutive archi- tecture to the right with its beaded archivolt, prominent cornice, fluted pilasters and Corinthian capitals duplicates forms on the surviving clocher at Cluny; heads that peer out from this structure recall those that peek down at the shoe- maker on the well-known "enseigne" in the Musee Ochier (Ibid., fig. 94 and Foto Marburg 35757; see Meyer Schapiro's comments on such sculptural marginalia, "From Mozarabic to Romanesque in Silos," Art Bulletin, XXI, 1939, p. 341). The obvious influence of two other workshops notwith- standing, several distinct Moutier characteristics are appar- ent. The concern with capital contour as an explicit frame for the sculptural field, the emphasis on ornamental, salient, globular forms (e.g., heads) as the organizers of the design, the differentiation between figure and ground and the fas- cination with accumulated, assertive details are used on the figurative sculptures in service of the art of story-telling; they appear as well on the foliate carvings discussed below. Otto P*acht analyzed the interest manifested during the second quarter of the twelfth century in representing ration- alized sequences of time; he linked this phenomenon to contemporary developments in religious drama (The Rise of Pictorial Narrative in Twelfth Century England, Oxford, 1962). The Emmaus story, which was the subject of a Mys- tery Play, the Peregrinus, owed its popularity to its celebra- tion of both devotional pilgrimage and liturgical feast. Both events were frequently depicted in the art of the twelfth cen- tury (L. Reau, Iconographie de l'art chretien, II-ii, pp. 562- 565). The curious double staff Christ carries appears again in the hands of one of the figures on the capital frieze at Chartres who is identified by it as a pilgrim (A. Heimann, op. cit., p. 86). The close fitting hat worn by the bottom fig- ure in the architecture on the right of the Fogg capital is identical to the vertically striped hat worn by the pilgrim from Santiago on the Autun lintel (Gislebertus, pl. Q) and contrasts with the beaded hats worn by the neighboring pil- grim to the Holy Land and by the shorter disciple on the Autun Emmaus capital (Ibid., pl. 2a).

The acanthus decoration on this tall Corinthian work re- calls that on the large capital from an engaged column in the transept at Cluny (Conant, "Excavations-iii," pl. I, C 111). In the Moultier version, the stalks have been elimina- ted, the upper row of leaves has been retracted under the helices and volutes and the furled ends of the leaves have been elaborated into tongue-like forms. The leaves are di- vided by vigorous modeling into a system of palpable ridges and furrows. Although occasional drill holes, short, double grooves at the base of diverging leaf shoots (tech- niques employed also at Cluny) and long linear incisions a- long selected petals bring surface relief to the deeply carved forms, the rich staccato pattern of angular darks that enliv- ens the Cluny sculpture is noticeably lacking. The isolation and enframement of a fleuron at the bottom of the main axis just above the damaged base recurs on the Cluny tran- sept capital mentioned above.

Rectangular leaves with furled tips are staggered in two rows beneath a salient, elevated arrangement of stalks, hel- ices and volutes. Along the central axis at the top, a large rosette awkwardly masks the transition between the artific- ially convoluted collar of the drum and the deeply recessed ornamented abacus. The capital demonstrates the difficulty of adjusting a design conceived for a circular surface to a planar one and the consequent loss of rhythm and vitality. The conservative acanthus ornamentation recalls that on the engaged capital in the transept at Cluny discussed above. The individual elements on the Fogg piece are isolated and flattened out, the leaves reduced by grooves to a collection of rectangular elements. These latter forms resemble those on a fragmentary capital with acanthus leaves at Vezelay (Fo- to Marburg 53432); both derive from more coherant and ab- stract foliage forms such as those on a fragment of a pilas- ter capital from Cluny unearthed by Conant (unmounted Co- nant photo, Fogg collection #333[?]). The tightly curled de- tached ends of the leaves under the volutes correspond closely to the tongue-like protrusions mentioned on the previous Moutier capital (.26); both are similar to the orna- mental buds suspended from the tips of the leaves on the Cluny fragment and the Vezelay sculpture. Two flatter pi- laster capitals from the north side of the crossing at Autun with comparable Corinthian decoration can also be com- pared to this sculpture (Gislebertus, pls. 62-63).

H. 25", W. 25", D. 23" (14"). No. 1922.27. Fig. 6. The careful arrangement of the three distinct decorative elements against the cylindrical drum emphasizes the vol- umetric geometry of the design. Two collared stalks, sup- porting slender helices and volutes, rise from central inter- vals between the three large leaves that form the middle zone of the capital. A collar formed around the lower third of the block by a projecting beaded band is ornamented with a row of six fleur-de-lis enclosed within arched frames (cf. the punched decoration on Fragment 522 from the am- bulatory at Cluny, K. J. Conant, "Excavations-vi," Speculum, VI, 1931, pl. Ib). One of the capitals Conant attributed to the cloister uses a comparable but less rigid scheme of leaves encased in tendril arches as appliques against the acanthus wrapped drum (Cluny, fig. 224). The heaviness of the organic forms is relieved primarily by the dry, inky sha- dows that fill the grooves and holes separating the tubular components of the vegetation. The liberated upper forms contrast strongly with the lower collar of crowded, shallow- ly cut motifs (cf. the beaded band on the angel capital at Bard-les-Epoisses).

Beaded stems arch over the central motif on (.25) and the theme of pine cones is repeated on (.24). The quality of this pilaster capital is markedly inferior. The coarse foliage lacks any interior life and the pine cones seem suspended in shapeless voids. The most emphatic part of the design is the series of tear-shaped intervals above the calyx of each pine cone in the middle zone. Despite the se- vere damage to the lower left corner, it is clear that the up- per forms on this side were never completed. Beading in the arched stem and texturing of the fruit are both missing; only the rosette receives distinctive treatment. The sculpture appears to have been hastily executed. FIGURE 7.

Heavy rectangular angles are reinforced on this capital through the union of tightly wound volutes with three large, thick, concentric leaves centered beneath them. The vast triangular shadows behind the scrolls and the drill holes at their centers provide the angles with a curiously animistic air initially observed by Brucia Withoft. Four aggressively furled leaves with semi-circular contours and two half leaves regularize the base of the capital; crudely folded around the angles, they are unable to enliven the front face of the work. Attention on this side is unfocused: none of the forms is sufficiently powerful to organize the design. At the top, a multipetalled conical rosette is lodged between a bit of cylin- drical drum and the ornamented involuted abacus. On the right side, a shoot emerging from the stalk fills the place of the rosette. FIGURE 8. Capital, Moultier Saint-Jean, XIIth century, end of the first quarter. A pilaster capital at the chateau at Bard-les-Epoisses is similarly dominated by heavy volutes with drilled nuclei which rise from a central collared stalk. Deep triangular pockets of shadow and the dense packing of leaves below the volutes also distinguish the well-preserved upper part of this work and relate it to the Fogg carving. A second com- parable sculpture in the collection of M. Xhanu on the site of the abbey employs five lacy leaves in a row along the base of a flatly carved capital. The workmanship on this latter piece especially recalls carvings at Langres and in the narthex at Autun (W. Schlink, Zwischen Cluny und Clairvaux, Berlin, 1970, figs. 27 and 30,31).

From the intervals between these leaves emerge ban- ded stalks which terminate in a single cleft fruit on the axis and additional cleft ones at the angles. Above, tiny recessed volutes are crushed under an unadorned and involuted aba- cus. The effect is rugged and regular with precise intervals and bold contrasts between rotund and planar, horizontal, vertical and triangular units. The main difference between the works is that the tips of the leaves of (.21) curl down ever so slightly, the crescent fruits are attached at the neck by tight bands and those on the second row rest on detached forked supports. Weathering of the surface on this piece has almost obliterated the central vertical ribs in the leaves. Sim- ilar leaf and fruit units can be found in a slightly different combination on capitals in the Cluny transept (Conant, "Ex- cavations-iii," pl. IV, C115 and pl. V., C129) and on a frag- ment excavated by Conant (unmounted photo 741, Fogg Collection). A capital, very much like (.21) survives at the chateau of Bard-les-Epoisses.

H. 25 1/2", W. 25", D. 23" (15 1/2"). No. 1922.22. Fig. 11. The trunk of a tree, placed at the center of the drum against a roughly worked ground, divides into two collared stems which rise toward the abacus and divide again. The upper branches and pendant fruit replace the traditional vo- lutes and helices of the Corinthian capital. Two additional branches sprout from the middle of the trunk and cross over concealing the bifurcation. Each of these partly detached branches terminates in a leafy spray entwined at the ang- les with an identical shoot emerging from a comparable half-tree on the sides. The massiveness of the sculpture is emphasized on close inspection by the prominence of tool marks. The foliate mo- tifs used to knot the stems are surprisingly lyrical. The re- verse heart-like curves of the upper leaves with their erect oval fruits can be seen in work at Cluny (Conant, "Excava- tions-iii," P1. III, C107; pl. V, C125 and C133). A more compact, seemingly squat capital still at Bard-les-Epoisses utilizes the same motifs in a more abstract manner.

These two capitals are more delicately proportioned, tight- ly organized and crisply carved than the other foliate pieces although they are of comparable size. Both pieces have been detached from the masonry block with which they would originally have been inset into the wall (this is also true of the five capitals still in the vicinity of Moutier). Both sculp- tures bear traces on the lateral surfaces of original poly- chromy. The design of the capitals focuses on a heart-shaped mo- tif of entwined, inverted leaves enframing an upright pine- cone or thistle (D. Jalabert, La flore sculptee des monuments du moyen-age en France, Paris, 1965, p. 68). On the first capital (.25), the device is centered beneath scaly arched stems on the main and side faces and also appears beneath the angles in lieu of volutes, on the central block of the aba- cus as an organic extension of the central motif and, in a FIGURE 12. Capital, Moutier Saint-Jean, Xllth century, end of thefirst quarter. chain of five, defining a broad collar around the lower third of the drum. The unusually crisp treatment of the abacus, in which decorative motifs drawn from the vocabulary of geometric and natural elements elaborated around the drum appear in a regularized pattern, is comparable to the scheme used on an elegant capital from Autun (Grivot-Zarnecki, Gislebertus, figs. B7 and B8). The juxtaposition of the works points up considerable differences between sculpture at the two churches. Whereas foliage on the Moutier carving is presented as lush and energetic and the motif is rhythmi- cally and organically developed, the sprays on the exquisite St.-Lazare relief have the air of a dried aromatic bouquet, the leaves and buds having shrunk away from their ample frames. Subtle details on the Fogg piece such as the wavy patterns between the fruit at the base, the undulant alterna- tion in the position of fruit on the upper level of the drum and the strong geometric reinforcement given to the articu- lation of the angle foliage further distinguish this work above all the others from Moutier. The closely related fragment published by Conant (Cluny, fig. 183 and supra, introduction) has recently been seen by Neil Stratford in a private collection at La-Roche-Vineuse, south of Cluny. The attribution of this piece to the great Benedictine abbey has never been doubted by Conant since FIGURE 13. Capital, Moutier Saint-Jean, XIIth century, end of the first quarter. 70</page><page sequence="13">fragments with strikingly similar thistle motifs turned up during his excavations on the site of the great portal (cf. fragment No. 1018.75, photo No. 575, unmounted Conant photo in the Fogg). Although Conant identified the large fragment as a piece of the conical support for the St. Mich- ael's chapel above the portal (Ibid., p. 104 and fig. 80), the sloped surface of the carving suggests that the piece may in fact have belonged to a capital. In addition to its greater size (about 2" taller), a series of small details, such as banded collars at the necks of the leaves, tubular rather than flat stems in the lower register and a herringbone rather than scaly pattern on the fruit in this zone differentiate the piece in Cluny from the Fogg capital. The same characteristics can be found on other pieces from or at Cluny, for example, a capital in situ in the Tour du Moulin, called to my atten- tion by Neil Stratford. A capital at Cluny sketched by van Riesamburgh early in the 19th century with a twisted arum motif and active foliage, also relates closely to the Fogg piece (A. Erlande-Brandenburg, "Iconographie de Cluny III," Bulletin monumental, 126, 1968, Cat. no. 29, fig. 36). On the second capital (.24), the arum motif appears on the lower part of the main axis enclosed within beaded stems which emerge from the mouths of grimacing, toothy masks at the sides. The shallowly carved heads are obscured by richly worked foliate sprays which also issue from their mouths, rise up toward the angles and furl back to display a diminutive fruit. The taut silhouettes of slender volutes which provide an upper frame for the main face are under- scored and overlapped by the claw-like petals that issue from the leafy sprays of a central stalk. The entire surface is animated by a variety of triangular intervals which create pockets and chains of shadow. The combination of heads with foliage is common in ma- ture Burgundian Romanesque sculpture appearing at Autun (Gislebertus, pl. 59), Saulieu (A. K. Porter, Pilgrimage Roads, II, pl. 58), Chalon-sur-Saone (Foto Marburg LA 779/7) and Langres (Schlink, op. cit., fig. 63) but the forms at these churches are all smaller, disengaged and genuinely anthropomorphic. The closest comparison to the treatment at Moutier occurs on sculpture from Cluny. On the plaques from houses, the mouth of a mask-like creature spitting fol- iage receives comparable emphasis (Foto Marburg 35779); in addition, two small capitals in the museum carry animal heads as the source for arching foliate sprays (Foto Mar- burg 35755, Nos. 111 and 114). These latter sculptures may belong to the cloister at Cluny dated by Conant to the mid '20s (Cluny, pp. 107). A striking, slender, well-preserved capital in the collect- ion of M. Challan-Belleval at Moitier uses the arum motif encased in flat tendrils along the lower part of the drum. The upper part of the capital is devoted to an elaborate scheme of compartmentalized leaves beneath conventional volutes. The integration of the abacus block into the orna- mentation of the main face is comparable to that described on the first of these Fogg capitals. The fragment recently published by Quarre displays the sharp treatment of the tips of the leaves seen on the second work (.24).

Severe penetrating cracks have left this richly carved but battered fragment in fragile condition. 71</page><page sequence="14">Brummer's attribution to Cluny is supported by compar- isons with sculptures from the abbey that display the same diminutive canopied configuration. One capital in the sur- viving transept carries similar architectural forms at the an- gles although these are poorly integrated with the foliate ornamentation below (J. K. Conant, Photo C153, Fogg Col- lection). A small, complex capital in the Musee Ochier, shows lush tendrils woven through the apertures on one side of the diminutive canopy at the top of the drum (Fo- to Marburg 35755, numbered 113). The beading used to out- line the leaves on the remaining sides of this Cluny piece also appears on the outer edge of a curled leaf on the Fogg sculpture. Another capital in the same photo (resting on one numbered 112) is organized around two slender arched forms similar in texture and contour to the fragmentary leaves on the Fogg sculpture. Occasional use of the drill, visible on the Cluny sculptures said by Conant to have come from Pontius' cloister (cf. Conant, Cluny, fig. 226), is also noticeable on the Fogg fragment. A striking comparison can be made with the canopied acanthus leaf capital that crowns an unusual rectangular pier said to have come from Cluny and photographed by A. Kingsley Porter at the dealer Demotte's in 1926 (Fogg pho- to 275 F912 86 (By); present whereabouts are not known). Only the arrangement of the common forms distinguishes the pieces: in the Demotte sculpture, the bridge between the corner turrets is circular, the cornices above are narrow and rectangular windows ornament the end sections of the can- opy. 3. ARCHITECTURAL FRIEZE. Cluny Second quarter, XIIth Century. Limestone. H. 9", W. 15". No. 1949.47.94; Purchase Alpheus Hyatt Fund. Formerly Brummer Collection. Fig. 15. Representations of two arcaded structures fill the interval between the frames of a pair of broken beaded roundels and the remains of a molding on this small relief. The sculpture belongs to a series that originally included two large reliefs in the Pitcairn Collection: one panel was exhibited at the Cloisters in late 1968 (C. G6mez-Moreno, Medieval Art from Private Collections. New York, 1968, No. 29) while the sec- ond, called to my attention by Walter Cahn, was exhibited at one time in Philadelphia (illustrated in Art News, March 21, 1931, p. 30). Unlike the former of these, which is decor- ated on the back with a frieze of small rosettes and a hori- zontal molding, the Fogg fragment has been split away from the original stone so that the miniature arcades, once screens against solid ground, are now pierced. These open parts have also sustained a series of breaks, one running through the door and continuous arcade, two others forming a wedge to the left of the central gable. Although the whole is dotted with lichen, the effects of exposure are limited, and weath- ering has not eroded the sharpness of the carving. Carmen G6mez-Moreno suggested that such reliefs pro- bably decorated the facade of houses at Cluny where they were installed above open arcades. Sculpture still in situ em- ploys only rosettes to fill the bare ground in the spandrels above ornamented arcades (houses, rue Lamartine, rue de la FIGURE 15.

The rectangular format of the piece shown at the Cloisters indicates that it was placed above a lintel, perhaps a gallery (as in the house photographed by Robert, No. III) rather than over an arcade. A large group of rectangular reliefs, decorated with foliage instead of architecture and dis- playing an alternation of animals and fleurons within the beaded roundels, is preserved in the Musee Ochier, Cluny (Foto Marburg 35774-35780). Fragments in the Musee des Ursulines at Macon, similar to the relief in the Fogg, have been called to my attention by Robert Moeller and Walter Cahn. Unusually careful observation of architectural detail is re- vealed in the Fogg sculpture. Coupled arcades separated by piers, as in the structure represented to the left, exist on the actual facades of the houses cited above. The inclusion of corbels and the elaborate treatment of the door are addition- al refinements on the Fogg fragment. The Medieval Sculptor, Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 1971, No. 15. FIGURE 16.

H. 101/2", W. 13" No. 1949.47.88; Purchase Alpheus Hyatt Fund. Formerly Brummer Collection. Fig. 16. A large deep circular plate contains a four-petalled ro- sette, the center of which is filled by a convex, floral motif. The surrounding rectangular field is hollowed out; one intact edge of the medallion projects in deep relief above the ground; the other merges with it. Although almost half of the roundel is broken away and the surface is quite dirty, the carving that remains is extremely crisp. Foliate roundels are the common decoration of archivolts in Burgundy. However, the regular, rather than convex, surface of this piece suggests that it was more likely included in a frieze of medallions such as those above the nave arcades at Vezelay (Salet, pl. 5) and Autun or those that outline the portal at Paray-le- Monial (Foto Marburg 40832). In contrast to the shallow carving of work from these monuments, the bold juxtapo- sition of identical convex and concave shapes as well as the calculated distribution of shadows on the Fogg piece create dramatic effects which, in their austerity, evoke work at Cluny. Comparable squat, petalled rosettes decorate the ab- acus above the figure of Charity on ambulatory capital 4, the Theological Virtues (Conant, Cluny, fig. 129); deeply carved roundels decorate a fragment of a door jamb from the great portal at the abbey (Ibid., fig. 187). Others are believed to have enclosed the tympanum within a rectangular field (Ibid., fig. 185). It is possible that the Fogg piece may have come from that project. 5. ROSETTE FRAGMENT.

Fresh and unfinished carving in addition to traces of old mortar along the surface suggest that this spandrel relief was broken and then employed as building material early in its existence. In addition to the major loss, a vertical section containing the bow and forearm of the figure to the left, several smaller losses have been sustained at two of the ex- tremities and along the lower left edge. An arc of a circle, slightly larger than that of the roundel, is faintly incised in the triangle of stone beneath the feet of the main figures. An ingenious composition has massed a number of ele- ments within the shallow depression of the central field. A hatted, haloed figure restrains a cloven-hoofed animal on the right while a hunter, with a quiver at his waist, is de- picted to the left. Beneath is a beast's head seen emerging from a leafy spray. The arrow the hunter has just released lies beyond the medallion incised in the rough ground to the right; the string of his bow flies free, etched in the sur- face above and behind him. William Coe identified the subject for the Fogg as St. Gilles protecting the hind from the hunter. The animal's head would be that of the hunter's dog. According to legend, the saint was nourished by a doe. One day, hunters of the King pursued the animal into the cave of the hermit wound- ing him instead of the beast with their arrow (Acta Sanct- orum, Sept. I, 284-304). In the unusual representation here, the arrow has missed or passed its mark. The piece was attributed to VEzelay at the time of its acquisition. Certain technical elements, such as the color of the stone and rustication of the uncarved surface with saw marks, are similar to work at the great abbey church (e. g., the great tympanum, Salet, pls. 18-19) suggesting that the association with the structure is accurate. In addition, the partially concealed head of an apostle beneath Christ's right hand on the tympanum (Foto Marburg 33037) recalls the low-browed, thick-necked creatures in the roundel. How- ever, supplementary comparison is difficult. The even, shal- low depression on the medallion here is closest in design to that employed for the roundels on a series of rectangular reliefs in the Musee Ochier, Cluny (supra). In particular, a roundel in which a human headed quadruped grapples with two dogs and another in which a stag is attacked by two beasts present similarly compact, gyrating forms shown either interrupted by or passing through the circular frame (Foto Marburg 35779, 35780). The relief was designed to fill the triangular zone above an arcade. It is impossible to say whether it was intended for use near a window on a fa;ade or in a cloister. The ar- caded plaques that survive from house facades at Cluny monotonously display flat open flowers in this area (Foto Marburg 35783); an elegant fragment, supposedly of a choir screen, is also decorated with only a modest rosette in the spandrel (Cluny, fig. 184). Comparable roundels with figur- ative decoration ornament spandrels in the cloister at Aix- en-Provence (H.A. von Stockhausen, "Die romanische Kreuzgainge der Provence," Marburger Jahrbuch fur Kunst- wissenschaft, VII, 1933, fig. 93 and VIII, 1936, fig. 183); two others from St.-Seine-l'Abbaye, now in the Archeolog- ical Museum at Dijon, have been brought to my attention by Walter Cahn (Chefs-d'oeuvre romans des musees de Pro- vince, ed. by Michele Beaulieu and Hubert Landais, Paris, 1957-58, p. 24, Nos. 33-34). A rectangular fragment in the Louvre, with a mask inside a half-roundel was found at St.- Denis, supposedly on the site of the cloister (Aubert-Beau- lieu, Description raisonnee, I, No. 50, p. 56). Although nothing is known about the Vezelay cloister, aside from the fact that two galleries were standing in the seventeenth century, an association of this relief with that structure should be considered. Viollet-le-Duc apparently copied old fragments found in the ground for his recon- struction of the wall outside the chapterhouse (F. Salet, La Madeleine de Vezelay, Melun, 1948, p. 91).

H. 9 1/2", W. 28", 5 1/2". No. 1949.47.71; Purchase Alpheus Hyatt Fund. Formerly Brummer Collection. Fig. 18. A second carved spandrel with a winged animal, also said to have come from Vezelay, differs in certain technical as- pects from the preceding piece. The extremities are tapered and the surface shows signs of wear, particularly along the right side. Moreover, the roundel is curiously incomplete. The tightness and elegance of the design suggests that the shallow arched edges of the block originally abutted the voussoirs of arcades although this would represent an ex- ceptional treatment of the medallion motif. The bottom point, beneath the animal's belly, is broken. The animal is a griffin, possessing the body of a lion and the head of an eagle; it is identical to one on the series of facade reliefs in the Mus6e Ochier at Cluny (Foto Marburg 35776). The handsome crisp border of acanthus leaves and punched rings against which the animal's neck and wings are silhouetted in bold relief resembles in position the inner rope-like frame around a grape-eating dog on another of the Cluny plaques (Foto Marburg 35778). The design and execution of the Fogg piece is more sophisticated and deli- cate however than the workmanship on the Cluniac reliefs. Arthur Beale, Associate Conservator of the Fogg, has found evidence of original paint in the eye and near the wing indicating that the medallion was formerly a ravishing vermillion in color. Subtle contrasts between powerful mod- eling of the body, precise incision of the hair, ribs and fea- thers and ornamental drill work in the border combine to confer on this piece uncommon vigor and sensitivity. Among the diverse and miscellaneous fragments preserved at Vez- elay are several that display a comparably powerful, orna- mental style (cf. in particular, the fragmentary capital with St. George; Salet, narthex no. 51, pl. 47). The formal and iconographic similarities relating this piece and the preced- ing one to work at Cluny may be linked to their comparable functions and relatively advanced dates.

The two slightly curved lower sides would have abutted the arcade; the upper part of the decorative roundel was lost during recutting. Mortar, covering chisel marks on this long and broken side, survives from re-use of the fragment. There is water damage along the right edge. A wreath of leaves enclosing pine cones surrounds a cen- tral foliate knob within the circular depression on this relief. A chain of tiny pyramidal forms frames the motif in a man- ner similar to that in which the preceding, slightly smal- ler disc is bordered. A comparably organized roundel con- taining pine cones pendant under dry, brittle leaves appears on a less vigorously carved capital at Vezelay, believed to have come from the cloister (Salet, pl. 47). In terms of car- ving, the Fogg sculpture, with its knob worked ajoure, more closely resembles a capital in the narthex on which similar forms, in strong relief, are arranged in a more con- ventional pseudo-Corinthian design (Ibid., pl. 48, No. 5). Despite the fact that the tiny shoots that sprout up between vegetal units in the Fogg medallion are akin to those that appear between the Zodiacal roundels in the archivolt at Autun (Gislebertus, pls. 13-18), stylistic and formal evidence points toward an attribution to Vezelay, possibly the clois- ter. 75</page><page sequence="18">9. FRAGMENT OF A CAPITAL. Vezelay. Ca. 1130. Limestone. H. 7", W. 7". No. 1949.47.50; Purchase Alpheus Hyatt Fund. Formerly Brummer Collection. Fig. 20. This delicately carved hand and portion of a draped knee display the hallmarks of style characteristic of several frag- mentary reliefs attributed by Salet to an early west facade program for Vezelay (Salet, pp. 47-48; illustrated in Gisle- bertus, pls. B29, B31). Such features as the exquisite organ- ization of parabolic folds in the drapery, conscientious arti- culation of relaxed anatomy, discrete use of beading and compact elongation of digits, all recall several evocative re- liefs still at Vezelay. The right hand and leg of a figure in three-quarter pose are shown. The left edge of the block is original; the right results from a break. The proportion and position of the figure suggests that it belonged to a capital. 10. CAPITAL (intwofragments). Vezelay. Ca. 1100. Limestone. No. 1949.47.68; H. 5", W. 8", D. 4".

The angle volute of a capital, composed of curled vegetal stalks, dominates one of the fragments (.68). Above, in- cised leafy forms spray forth from a thick shoot. The second piece is adorned with a palmette inscribed within its own semi-circular frame (.69). A broken bit of the same motif appears on the side. The grooving of the leaves and the deep, irregular shadows that surround the palmette echo the treatment of sprouts on the first piece. A comparable treat- ment of foliage on a re-employed capital with Adam and Eve in the nave at Vezelay (Salet, No. 65, pl. 13) supports Brummer's association of these carvings with the church of the Madeleine. Leon Pressouyre, who pointed out that the two Fogg fragments belonged together, commented that he had seen similar pieces at Vezelay, possibly from the clois- ter there. :: : ,:~~~~~2 FIGURE 20.

This scant but precise evidence concerning style as well as condition points to the north portal at St.-Lazare as the or- iginal location of the carving. Relief fragments attributed to this part of the church show independent figures, facing to the side, with their arms extended (Ibid., pls. IV, V, VI, VIII). Drapery is defined there, as on this fragment, by a combination of closely placed incisions bounded by long rib- bons of ornament on sleeves and grouped worm-like striations at hips or knees. Strong geometry of the compo- sition and emphasis on intervals around figures are also characteristic of the north portal sculptures. The theme of the sculptures at this, the functioning main entrance to the church, was the Resurrection of Lazarus, ac- cording to a description of 1482. The carvings were pulled down in 1766 at the behest of the church itself; most were reused and only a few of them have come to light and been identified. The Eve from the lintel is the most celebrated of the group (Ibid., pp. 148ff and pl. I b). Zarnecki noted that one of the reliefs from the north door, that showing the Adoration of the Magi in the north part of the interior (p. 150). Details of the Fogg fragment recall certain passages of ornamentation and drapery on the celebrated Flight into Egypt capital reinforcing Zarnecki's observation of a re- lationship between the Infancy carvings and the north por- tal. This quadrangular stone fragment, attributed to Autun at the time of its purchase, is dominated by the remains of a figure poised at the right edge facing left. A long sleeve dangling loosely from a bent raised arm overwhelms the torso which is still visible from approximately the should- ers to the knees. A trace of delicately incised ornamentation, composed of cross-hatching framed by drill holes and small regular beads, identifies the badly damaged form in the lower left corner as a piece of furniture, probably the edge of a chair or throne (cf. Gislebertus; pls. lOa, 12a, 33a, 37b). The two carved elements are separated by a boldly shaped patch of bare ground. The fact that the carving of the figure to the right does not extend around to the back together with the absence of any tool marks along the edges of the piece indicates that the fragment was broken away from a larger work. Judging from the abraded and weathered na- ture of the surface and the presence of two iron stains along the edge of the pendant sleeve, it is apparent that the sculp- ture was directly exposed to harsh conditions for some time. 77</page><page sequence="20">The bit of carving that survives links the figure intimate- ly to the imposing angel fragment in the Cloisters known to have come from Abb6 Terret's collection in Autun (Gisle- bertus, pl. VIII). The characteristic grouped striations in the drapery and alternation of beaded and drilled ornamentation distinguish both pieces. The elevated flourish of drapery above the ankles on the Fogg sculpture is an especially graceful invention. Hovering rather than seated, the attitude of the angel is enhanced by the detachment of the middle section of the body. Bibliography: V. Terret, La sculpture bourguignonne, Autun, 1925,II,50.

The leg draperies of a seated figure, seemingly airborne with ankles crossed, is all that remains in tact on this trap- ezoidal stone. The curved contour on the left, slope at the top and the presence of tool marks on all four sides identify the block as a voussoir. Robert C. Moeller further associ- ated the piece with one of the angels described by Abb'e Terret as belonging to the innermost archivolt around the tympanum on the north door at Autun (V. Terret, La sculp- ture bourguignonne, Autun, 1925, II, 50; cited in Gisleber- tus, pp. 180-181). That project has been dated by Zarnecki to about 1130 (Ibid., p. 164). From the diagonal placement of the figure on the stone, it is clear that the piece was in- serted about midway up the arch. Its head and halo would have been carved on the adjacent stone above; the halo of the lower angel is outlined by the semi-circular protrusion FIGURE 23.

Three narrow tubular bands framing two rows of beads traverse the slender cylindrical form seen rising abruptly from a broken angular base. Two crosses, marked by drill holes at the end of each arm and at the center, are aligned on either side of the beading. The pattern terminates at the right at what appears to be the original edge; at the left, the bands undulate continuously across an indentation in the surface. This piece was among those attributed to Autun at the time it was acquired. A similar design, composed of two beaded bands framing a single cross, is found on the thigh of one of the apostles on the Emmaus capital in the choir at Autun (Gislebertus, pl. 2a). On the great Judgment tym- panum there, the upright angel to the right of Christ's man- dorla is shown with two crosses divided by a triple band of beads on the upper thigh and hip (Ibid., pl. G). It is not clear what function the Fogg piece served at the church. Ob- viously a fragment of a larger sculpture, it may also have be- longed to the decoration of the north portal. 14. FRAGMENT OF A TORSO; Autun, Lazarus tomb (?) Mid XIIth century. Limestone. H. 11", D. 63/4". No. 1949.47.103; Purchase Alpheus Hyatt Fund. Formerly Coll. Abbe Terret andJ. Brummer. Fig. 24. This fragment of the upper torso of a figure was said to have come from Autun at the time of its acquisition. It is carved in the round. An unworked area down the center of the back suggests that the figure faced straight out; a coarse ridge at the level of the waist indicates the point at which the figure may have been attached. As the result of pro- longed and extreme exposure, the surface is badly abraded and stained. A small repair in plaster has been attempted at the bottom. The figure is posed with its arms raised, shoulders turned slightly to the left. The long swirls of drapery, composed of coupled worm-like strands seharated by sharp incisions, as well as thicker tubular folds, empha- size the movement and articulation of the body. Heightened interest in anatomy and a similar definition of drapery char- acterize the group of standing figures that survives from the monumental tomb built for St. Lazarus' relics during the fourth and fifth decades of the XIIth century (P. Quarre, "Les sculpteurs du tombeau de saint Lazare a Autun et leur place dans l'art roman," CCM, V, 1962, pp. 169-174 and pl. IV, figs. 14, 15). The Fogg torso may be a fragment from that project (cf. also R. Hamann, "Das Lazarusgrab in Au- tun," Marburger Jahrbuch fur Kunstwissenschaft, VIII-IX, 1936, figs, 16,25, 29). FIGURE 24.

Purchase Alpheus Hyatt Fund. Formerly Brummer Col- lection. Figs. 25 and 26. The nude atlas that peers out from the first of these two corbels is an example of the playful obscenities that are fre- quently encountered in the marginal zones of medieval sculpture. The crouching figure is viewed from the back, one arm raised to support the molding above. His other arm reaches down diagonally toward his buttocks emphasizing the large anus and prominent genitalia readily visible from below. The theme is not an uncommon one; two similar and several related sculptures in the vicinity of Angoultme are discussed as representations of Luxuria by J. George and A. Guerin-Boutaud, Les eglises romanes de l'ancien diocese d'Angouleme, Paris, (1928, pp., 266-67, fig. 235 A-K). The second, sexless, figure is viewed from the front; rhythmic striations on the underside of the thighs indicate drapery. Although general weathering of the figures has obliterated details which would be helpful in localizing the carvings, the vigorous detachment of the figures, the con- vincing articulation of the anatomy and the broad flat facial type as well as the licentious themes bring to mind capitals at Anzy-le-Duc in Burgundy (nude and shortskirted figures inhabit these works as well: Foto Marburg 31345; James Austin KR8). A series of animate corbels enlivens the roof line on the exterior of the nave and east end of the church (Foto Marburg 31316); photographic documentation was not available for close comparison. *This is the first of several instalments in this series to be devoted to the Romanesque sculpture of the Fogg Museum. Objects not presently on ex- hibit are available for study at the Busch-Reisinger Museum nearby. The study profited greatly from the support and cooperation of Daniel Rob- bins and, before him, of Agnes Mongan. Arthur Beale provided invaluable observations on the technical aspects of many of the carvings. Walter Cahn made countless suggestions throughout the course of the study and Leon Pressouyre offered valuable criticism at its conclusion.
