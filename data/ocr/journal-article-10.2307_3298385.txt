<plain_text><page sequence="1">102 BOOK REVIEWS Athenian Religion: A History. By ROBERT PARKER. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996. Pp. xix + 370. Robert Parker has performed an inestimable service in gathering, organizing and interpreting virtually all available information about Athenian religious practice that can be fitted into a chronological frame- work. He has done this so meticulously and with such good sense that his work will have to be the starting point for future study of almost any Athenian cult. Furthermore, he has made his study as readable as possible: documentation (astoundingly thorough even through the mid-90's) is confined to small-print footnotes (almost half the total words!) below a smoothly and engagingly written overview. If this is not a text for beginners that is only because Parker's presentation of the evidence and its various inter- pretations is uncompromisingly honest. The ride through history is bumpy, as it must be given the nature of the evidence. We begin in the 8th C. where the exiguous archaeological remains and the tradition of Theseus' synoecism allow a reconstruction with a quasi-king or king-magistrate at the center of public cult, with priests provided by the gene, aristocratic funding, "petrefaction of reli- gious sentiment into stone structures" just beginning, and with other worshipping groups including individuals, households, phratries, local associations. More substantial is the discussion of 8th-7th C. hero cults (whose origins are obscure and range of types too great for "a socio-political explanation of any simple type") and mountain sanctuaries (whose numerous graffiti at Hymettus suggest "a broader clientele" than farmers concerned about the weather). The 6th C., "the great age of transformation", requires four chapters. "Solon's Calendar" is fished out of the exiguous remains of the Nicoma- chean revision at the end of the 5th C. and provides the opportunity to discuss Athenian calendars in general, which were not "do it yourself" ritual guides but descriptions of "what monies of the Athenian people were to be expended on what gods". "Archaic Priesthood" with its asso- ciated appendix "The Gene" provides an invaluable checklist and survey of these patrilinear hereditary religious groups, "the structure through which the allocation of priesthoods was organized in archaic Attica". "New Splendors" describes the proliferation of monumental architecture and spectacular urban festivals associated with (but not confined to) the Peisistratids: Acropolis ramp, large limestone temple to Athena, Eleusinian initiation hall, temple to Olympian Zeus, Altar of the Twelve Gods, the Panathenaia "transformed into an athletic festival of Panhellenic appeal", and the City Dionysia (re)founded for choral competitions (the early history of these last two is discussed in detail in an Annexe). "Before and After Cleisthenes" considers possible changes in the principal hereditary religious structures: deme (which must have grown from 'proto-demes'), tribe, and phratry (with its subdivisions, gene and orgeones), concluding that Cleisthenes was quite conservative: "the uniformly created tribes immediately acquired a pleasing, natural-seeming diversity".</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 103 The three chapters devoted to the 5th C. not surprisingly comprise over a third of the whole. "Democracy and Empire" considers how allot- ment reduced the priesthood "as it were to a minor magistracy", how public funerals lessened the focus on the individual and how assigned liturgies meant "the real benefactor might now seem to be the political system which forced the liturgist to be generous"; it then turns to imperial religious policy: how allies were compelled to send offerings to Athens and how Athenian presence was felt in Oropos and Delos. "New Gods" in a very important chapter are shown to be "a quite normal operation of polytheism": 'foreign gods' is a scholarly construct ("what really changes in the last quarter of the century is the character of our evidence"); it is better to talk of "the unlicensed god" who is "exposed to suspicion, hos- tility, contempt, and the threat of actual repressive action" since 'foreign gods' were diverse in nature and in their reception in Athens, as Parker's thoughtful Annexe makes clear. The chapter "Trial of Socrates" disap- pointingly (but perhaps inevitably) breaks no new ground (the trial was both political and religious; "religious resentment against Socrates was not necessarily the less acute for being misdirected"), though it sensibly discounts the plague or impieties of 415 as catalysts for a rise in disbelief, seeing rather a crisis of sorts when "natural philosophy was felt to be combined with moral relativism or antinomianism". The chapter on the 4th C. treats post-imperial Athenian religious policy (mostly Delos, mostly Hyperides' fragmentary "Delian Speech"), Lycurgus' religious program (leaning heavily on an essay by Sally Hum- phreys), and, in a full and pointed study, deified abstractions, beginning with what we know (mostly epigraphical) about the new 4th C. divinities (Democracy, Peace, Agathe Tyche) whose difference from the older ab- stractions is more quantative than qualitative: "the new abstractions were claiming a substantial share of the public ritual budget" but the Olympians at the same time "continued to diversify and proliferate in the traditional way" (Hermes Hegemonios, Aphrodite Euploia, Zeus Soter, Zeus Philios- though one may look askance at the inclusion of these last two). The final chapter, "Beyond the Death of Alexander", argues for gradual change rather than a sharp break at the end of the 4th C., but since the sources are limited to inscriptions "no more can be attempted than isolated views". The main changes are the rise of ruler cult ("through external circumstance, not a development or decline in belief"); the decline of demes, phratries, and tribes as active entities (the disapperance of large numbers of familiar Attic festivals may simply reflect lack of evidence); the rise of military garrisons and non-citizen private associations (a boom but not a revolution); individuals achieving "a lasting place in the ceremo- nial life of the city" via wealth or merit not via family; and the acceptance of philosophers (after persecution at the end of the 4th C.) with their "meta- phorical interpretation of the traditional forms of anthropomorphic cult". Thus the story is to a degree the familiar one, minus the crisis at end of the 5th C. and the decline in 3rd, and one may suspect that the more coherent and comprehensible literary sources have counted for more than</page><page sequence="3">104 BOOK REVIEWS the material remains. Vase painting, for example, is hardly considered, and even the epigraphical record so fully cited to attest a cult might oc- casionally be made to yield more (e.g. the changes in the Acropolis treasures). Also, since the evidence concerns mostly civic cult, Parker does not say much about the individual (e.g. Dionysiac or Orphic mysteries) and even claims that the private always has a public dimension ("the antithesis between 'public' and 'private' proves not be absolute even at its extreme points"). Perhaps the individual will come more to the fore in the thematic study of which this volume is the prelude (which, incidentally, may explain the book's sparing subject index, limited mostly to proper nouns). A final quibble is that there may be an historical bias in Parker's repeated focus on the commemorative function of cult. In any case, Parker's achievement is stunning. I hope a paperback version appears soon (with chapter numbers added to the headers to harmonize with the cross-reference system), but no serious student of Classical Athens should be deterred by the hardback price: like many Oxford commentaries, Athenian Religion has permanent value.
