<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE FICTION IN CHILE 181 Remi-Maure Science Fiction in Chile' Translated by Lynette Stokes, Laird Stevens, &amp; RMP 1. Chile, unlike Argentina, does not seem to have had a "Prehistory" in its development of SF. Even fantasy, a genre which had been flourishing for decades in neighboring Argentina, was almost entirely absent. In other words, SF was until recently something imported into Chile, even though it has produced brilliant lit- erature in other genres ever since it attained nationhood. SF entered Chile before 1959 primarily through the channel of Spanish and Argentinian works, which apparently engendered nothing in the way of indigenous SF beyond a few isolated short stories which led nowhere. Then suddenly, in 1959, appeared not only a novel but a writer, Hugo Cor- rea, who remains the best and most prolific of his country, with five SF books to his credit. This may not seem like much of an output for the 22 years that he has been writing, but for Latin America and a non-professional writer, it is. Correa (b. 1926) is the only Chilean writer of SF who can boast an international audience: his novellas have not only been published in Spain; they have been translated into German, English, French, Portugese, and Swedish. Of all the Chilean contribu- tors to the genre, he is the only one who ought truly to be considered as an author of SF. None of the others, in fact, has written more than three books: hence his importance in this study. Correa's first novel, Los Altisimos (The Superiors, 1959), in some measure prefigures Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama (1973) by reason of its nar- rative proceeding of describing at length the inside of an artificial world without introducing any real action. It also brings to mind Clarke's Childhood's End (1953) because of the way it reflects on the destiny of a people which has become the plaything of unknowable cosmic entities. It is one of the great modern classics in Latin-American SF. Los Altisimos is the story of a Terrestrial whose destiny accidentally be- comes linked to that of the inhabitants of Cronn. Cronn is a world, 33,000 kilo- meters in diameter, which conceals beneath its sterile surface eight concentric planets. These are of equal size, with symmetrical continents; all support inhabi- tants on their convex side and all but one on their concave side as well; and each is surrounded by four satellite rings, which are also inhabited. For millions of years, Cronn has been racing through galaxies at the speed of light in a quest which the Cronnians themselves do not understand. The Terrestrial is about to evolve amongst the 10,000 million inhabitants of this perfectly standardized world, where the citizens possess nothing, are con- stantly monitored, and cannot stay in the same apartment for more than one day; where marriage is unknown and relationships lasting longer than a day are forbid- den; where women have been made genetically sterile and reproduction is accom- plished in gigantic incubators. He thinks at first that this world is located at the interior of the Earth, but he progressively discovers its true nature.</page><page sequence="2">182 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) He eventually realizes that the true masters of Cronn are not the Technicians, the robotized Cronnians who control everything, but the Superiors, quasi-divine entities who have chosen the Cronnians to accompany them in their peregrina- tions. Invisible but immanent, it is they who constructed this world into which they welcomed the Cronnians after having exploded their sun. On several occa- sions, the Cronnians have revolted against their masters, who punish them periodi- cally; and one of the high points of the novel concerns the decimation-by means of a rain of billions of cadavers from a previous punishment, then expelled into space and now "recycled"- of the populace gathered on the surface. The central idea of Los Altisimos is that of a humanity which, enclosed in a prison planet, is not master of its destiny, yet in fact is hardly less so than terres- trial humanity, to which the same fate could happen. The book is also an ominous satire on communist society pushed to the limits of deindividualization. Literarily considered, the fiction unfolds as the successive stages of an enigma which leads only to other enigmas, themselves unsolvable. And it is not the least merit of the author to have been able to make this grandiose work a passionate and gripping tale. From 1959 to 1968, Correa published numerous short works of fiction.2 One of these is the novella Alguien mora en el viento (Someone Dwells in the Wind), which appeared in 1959 as a small book and is one of the author's master- pieces. It is the story of two astronauts whose rescue capsules run aground on one of the vegetable islets which float among the violent and noxious winds of Venus. Inside one of these, they find a Terrestrial born from a couple shipwrecked there more than 15 years earlier. But they also find themselves confronted with invisible presences which haunt the tempest. These do not manifest themselves materially, but rejecting some reduces a person to old age, while accepting others restores youth. Apart from the original and imaginative framework, this novella is note- worthy for its half-tone atmosphere and for the human character of the adventure, something it has in common with many of the author's other works. At the same time, it stands, with several other stories about as long, in contrast to a whole series of brief tales of Correa's which display his black humor-a contrast which demonstrates his eclecticism. Correa's second novel, El que merodea en la iluvia (The One Who Prowled in the Rain, 1961), proposes an enigma of cosmic origin: a creature from another world brought to ours, but placed in a conventional context, the Chilean country- side. Unfortunately, the work is laden with a series of redundancies and uninterest- ing dialogue, with flashbacks to a dreary plot-line concerning inconsistent char- acters. All of this banalizes a theme which, while not original, is singularly evocative. Near a crater formed by the crash of a Russian rocket, a presence mani- fests itself on rainy days by an intense cold and the smell of mud. Coming from a chest of lunar samples which was recovered empty, it provokes the interest of various people, some of whom, thinking to enrich themselves, are found suffo- cated in the mud. But if the thing only comes to life in the presence of water, it remains conscious even in its latent state and can influence human minds. Thus it forced the Russian technicians into a wrong maneuver which caused their rocket to crash; and it chooses a human being, Salvador, to accomplish its mission of domination. How? The reader will no more find out than discover the real nature of the Prowler. Such haziness lends itself to a very mystifying ending, but does not justify the length of the book. Los Titeres (The Marionettes, 1969), without being a novel, almost has novelistic unity. A collection of four stories, it centers around the major social</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE FICTION IN CHILE 183 upheavals existing since teleguided and personalized robots have become com- monplace. Provided with an introspective helmet capable of transmitting not only vision and sound but also touch and smell, such a robot, irrespective of who is giving it orders, can perform with this intermediary device what it is incapable of performing in the flesh. Each story presents one aspect of this revolution. In "Alter Ego," a man commits "suicide" through his double, while "El Vera- neante" ("The Vacationer") focuses on both anonymity and the denial of the Other that these simulacra seem to favor. As to the other stories in Los Titeres, they are really short novels which set for themselves a broad panorama. "El Mundo del Tio Roberto" ("The World of Uncle Robert") depicts a civilization where people stay at home while the streets are swarming with puppets (who often look younger than their owners) and where organized groups conduct a hopeless struggle against robots. "El Hombre Prohibido" ("The Forbidden Man") recounts the consequences of a conspiracy by which opponents of a government will replace it under the cover of robots. The book as a whole, while its inspiration is down to earth, is an example of intelligent sociological SF, depicting in a way that is at once logical and disquieting a civilization which has chosen to live by proxy. Correa's last novel to date, El Nido de las furias (The Nest of the Furies, 1981), is something of an event since it marks his return to the genre after a silence of ten years. It has as its setting an imaginary Latin American country ruled by a general whose origin seems linked to the gigantic edifices left by a prehistoric people. Skillfully combining a series of flashbacks with an unfolding of a deterior- ating political situation, the author hints how it was that a nameless extra-terrestrial being long ago made a covenant with this people, and then destroyed them when he was betrayed. Back on Earth the extra-terrestrial then impregnated a virgin who gave birth to the tyrant whose career the story takes to the point of his disappearance-or rather his fusion with his progenitor. As in his previous novels and in Alguien mora en el viento, Correa remains faithful to his taste both for mystery tinged with metaphysics and for Christian symbolism. Refusing to fall into the trap of anthropomorphism or of Grand-Guignol, he prefers to stay vague in the final resolution of his stories or even to renounce it so as not to mislead his readers into a false sense of certainty, as is something of the case with El Nido de las furias. It is true that there is more than this in his work. Nonetheless, we may ask if the idea that the unknowable dominates human life justifies the kind of self-censorship that Correa exerts on an imagination which, in his humorous stories for instance, he has brilliantly and poetically exploited. This is the dilemma that betrays his work when he is too serious. 2. If there exists in Chile a second author of SF, he can be none other than Antonio Montero Abt, who unfortunately seems to have ceased all activity after having produced three volumes. Like the two to come, his first book, Los Super- homos (The Supermen, 1963), appeared under the pseudonym Antoine Mon- tagne-a sign of his Francophilia. Los Superhomos, a very classical novel of extremely simple and linear construction, features 30 criminals whom rehabilita- tion treatment transforms into geniuses gifted with parapsychological powers. Motivated by an impersonal sense of justice, they deplore the chaotic and cruel vision which their super-telescope allows them of other intelligent species in the galaxy. They propose to humanity that they conquer it and thereby establish their perfect order for it: the Earth will supply the troops and they will supply the brains. Confident in their coercive methods despite humanity's refusal of their proposi-</page><page sequence="4">184 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) tion, they begin preparations; and their galactic crusade would have taken place if the spaceship transporting them had not been booby-trapped to send them into a dimension of no return. Though somewhat outmoded and lacking in originality, the story is creditable and without pretensions. On a distinctly superior level is Acd del tiempo (This Side of Time, 1969). It exploits a variant of the theme of Los Superhomos, but in a more sophisticated manner. Also classical in its overall structure, it represents a more dignified vehi- cle than its predecessor for the author's ideas on the relationship between science and power. Aca del tiempo starts with the discovery in a Peruvian cave of an enormous thinking machine which is a depository of knowledge for a non-human race which died out more than 33 million years ago. Constructed by that race's last representa- tives to relay to future intelligences the fruit of their thought, it fathoms the minds of the sages who presently appear before it for its assessment of them. These sages plot to overthrow the Integrated Administration which governs the Earth in the 22nd century; their program is to install a regime conformable to the dictates of the machine. The machine is clearly a poisoned gift: it too far exceeds the human mind's capacity to use it; and even its builders know that they had created a monster-or a myth-and left a warning about it before they expired. The destruc- tion pf the machine by means of an atom bomb left over from the Last World War provides a classic conclusion to this story about an all-powerful mechanical law- giver, a conclusion which has nothing of the childishness which the theme often entails. Montero is also the author of a certain number of short stories, eight of which appeared in No Morir (No More Dying, 1971). The most interesting, "De Regreso" ("Coming Home," 1967), tells of the discovery by three astronauts on Jupiter of a replica of Paris, with all its inhabitants and monuments. On their return to Earth, they find the planet devastated by an atomic war and can only return to Jupiter, where the Parisians, just before the Bomb exploded, relocated themselves by the collective power of their minds. "Este Abismo" ("This Abyss") is the monologue of the astronaut who is the lone passenger on a ship crossing the intergalactic void. This fiction belongs to the intimate vein of the author, as does Aca del tiempo and also "Los Gemidos" ("The Laments"), a short story about the last night of a little girl who perceives the suffering of nature before the final destruction. Montero's short stories are of unequal merit; the dif- ferences between them are as marked as between his two novels. In any event, the best of his work demonstrates marked progress and makes it regrettable that he has published nothing since the early 1970s. 3. With Armando Menedin and Elena Aldunate Bezanilla, we come to two authors who have contributed little to the SF genre; but that little is not without talent. Born in Argentina, to which he returned in 1973, Menedin lived for a long time in Chile, where a number of his works were written. He is a pure writer, novelist, and story teller, but most of all an engage dramatist. His short story "Laura" (1963) is a Martian chronicle in the form of a prose poem: to go through the subterranean canals on Mars, with their mineral curiosities and swarms of giant butterflies is to encounter a veritable swirl of sound and color. His major work, however, is the short novel La Crucifixi6n de los magos (The Crucifixion of the Magi, 1966), a baroque and ironic work set on Phobos, a penitentiary satel- lite where a thousand exiles vegetate, reduced to a tribal state and doomed to a slow death in the rarefied atmosphere. A magus then comes who knows how to</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE FICTION IN CHILE 185 conjure up images in mirrors and who becomes friends with an old illusionist. The latter does not manage to save the magus from being stoned when, after having shown the exiles images from their childhood, he refuses to fall in with their whims. However, he would have promised them deliverance; and, in fact, the spaceship which comes to get him after his rehabilitation announces the imminent closing of the penitentiary. Aldunate (b. 1923) is also a pure writer who has worked in other areas. With an elaborate style and great sensitivity, she began publishing SF in the '60s. Her novella La Bella dormiente (The Sleeping Beauty, 1976) typically exemplifies her pacifist philosophy: a hibernating woman is brought to life in the milieu of a civili- zation which has attained a perfect state of equilibrium and serenity and into which she reintroduces the fears and anxieties of the 20th century. In her novella Del Cosmos las quieren virgenes (The Cosmos Requires Virgins, 1977) she imagines-under the influence of H.G. Wells's Star Begotten (1937) or John Wyndham's The Midwich Cuckoos (1957)?-benevolent extra-terrestrial butter- flies provoking the birth of little pacifist mutants to save humanity. Here, how- ever, the author falls into the trap of sentimentality which she avoids in Angelica y el delfin (Angelica and the Dolphin, 1976), the moving story of an encounter between a young woman and an intelligent dolphin. 4. If a tradition of Chilean SF is being outlined by the advent of Correa, followed by Montero, Menedin, and several others, its most regrettable aspect is its quanti- tative poverty. Here we meet with all the drama of a movement that has not been able to grow for want of an outlet. Most of the Chilean authors engaged in writing SF have never had a book of theirs appear-which suggests that lots of manuscripts remain unpublished. To talk of a "Golden Age" of Chilean SF may therefore seem ironic. And yet, within bounds, it has existed: between 1959 and 1975, the years encompassing the publication of almost all of the Chilean SF that we have. As well, in 1967 a small SF magazine called Espacio-Tiempo was created in an attempt to revive from the other side of the Andes the spirit of Mais Alla, an Argen- tine publication which, between 1953 and 1957, made SF known both in Latin America and in Spain. The only two numbers of Espacio included, along with the inevitable US writers, three Chileans: Correa, Montero, and Aldunate. It might have become a catalyst for the genre in Chile but for the indifference to its editors' courageous, if modest, initiative. But there were also the isolated in- stances of SF writing, and they, too, have contributed to Chilean SF. First of all two thin collections of 13 stories apiece are worth mentioning. The less interesting of the two, Uranidas, Go Home! (1966) by Rene Peri Fager- strom, contains stories which are mainly ironic or humorous, but fairly superfi- cial. We might single out "Hoy, Gran Match Intersolar" ("Grand Intersolar Match Today"), a satire on sports on an interplanetary scale, and "De Profun- dis," about the misadventures of a company of tunnel-diggers who discover that the world is hollow before its interior's inhabitants expel them through an active volcano. The second anthology, La Tierra dormida (The Earth Asleep, 1969) by Ilda Cadiz Avila, comprises mainly a series of often gripping vignettes. "Una Peguenia Muestra" ("A Small Sample"), for instance, evokes an extra-terrestrial visitor bending over a found object in the ruins of the Earth and using it to repair some- thing. "Final de un Suenio" ("The End of a Dream") is a monologue by a survivor of Olbers' planet, whose asteroid was hit by fragments of the Earth. "Nostalgia" has as its heroes two adolescents, living in a gigantic artificial satellite in which</page><page sequence="6">186 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) life and civilization have taken refuge and dreaming of going back to devastated Earth. Finally, "Los Seres de los Andes" ("The Creatures of the Andes"), the only long story, is the chronicle of the survivors of a new ice age who take refuge in the caves in the Andes. All countries have their established writers who condescend momentarily to leave "literature" for SF. In Chile, such a writer is Miguel Arteche, novelist and poet, a master of the Castilian language. His novel El Cristo hueco (The Empty Christ, 1969) takes place two centuries hence, several decades after a six-month war that ravaged the planet and even outer space. Using atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, the southern hemisphere has overwhelmed the northern hemisphere. Many European cities are still in ruins, and Rome, together with the Papacy, is nothing but a memory. On these ashes are built the New World State and the New Church, which are allies. The former has installed a hard and authori- tarian regime, while the latter is reformed to the point of allowing divorce and codifying adultery. Both lead humanity towards an ideal life which is purely materialistic, and all opposing them are excommunicated and hunted like pariahs. Nevertheless, the opponents become more and more numerous, and as they begin to win influence, the oppression increases. However, the regime vacillates-and the story of its fall subtends the entire plot. The pivot-or starting point-of the story is a dead man, Manuel, a heretic whom the New State had ordered eliminated and whose ghost is in fact the princi- pal character. The temporal power seems to have reacted very violently to such an insignificant individual, even if he was gifted with parapsychological powers before his disappearance; his ashes were scattered to avoid making a martyr out of him. An inquest is ordered, apparently to unmask the murderer, but in fact to resolve the mystery of Manuel. The investigator is Inspector Martin of the World Security Directorship, an ex-rebel who has joined the New State. He goes to the house of Archpriest Humberto, who before denouncing Manuel was his protector, and now burdened with the secrets of two powers is a prelate upon whom weigh serious presumptions. At Humberto's Martin finds Antonio, Governor of the South Pacific, who puts the policies of the regime into practice, but without con- viction. He is the official lover of Magdalena, the wife of Captain Sinker, whom the pariahs secretly win over after an insurrection on Mars. All these characters, developing in an atmosphere of conspiracies, reveal themselves one after another. One of the instruments used in the inquest is the Screen, a device which records, and is capable of reproducing, everything around it. Installed obligatorily in the houses of all high spiritual and temporal functionaries, it is a valuable means of control-if it is not circumvented. Thus the intimate details about all present, even the dead man, are going to be betrayed. But in fact, what the investigation reveals is the advanced state of human spiritual and social disintegration. It does not much matter that the guilty party turns out to be the inspector, who commits suicide when the regime crumbles. Together the personages take us for a walk on an Earth where the combined power of State and Church has made the satisfac- tion of material human needs the supreme purpose. "Christ," the author has In- spector Martin say, "changed slowly but inexorably into a giver of material things, and it was necessary therefore to eliminate every detail which in him would have brought suffering to mind. The power of the New State, the temporal power, lied and banished in the name of an aseptic Christ, and then sold a parody of free- dom, a parody which, for those who did not accept it, contradicted what the cross signified: love through suffering."3</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE FICTION IN CHILE 187 What Arteche narrates is simply a retelling of the adventure in the cata- combs. What he is expressing through the charismatic Manuel is the appearance of a new Saint Peter (more brilliant than the first). What he is exalting is the Church in its primitive purity, as opposed to that which compromises with the times and the money-changers. Such a novel fits marvelously into the ultra-Catholic context of Latin America, and it is not unique in the SF of those countries. This return to the "spirit of the catacombs" that the author advocates as a remedy to the increasing materialism of modern civilization, while it is a homage to the Evangel- ists, is also a criticism of a Church already contaminated. The "empty Christ" is a warning: the author has his idea of Christianity and is preaching it for his parish. A very beautiful sermon, magnificently written and orchestrated but, it must be recognized, a little long; and its density does not relieve an atmosphere which is turbid and suffocating-and no less repellent for being intentionally so. 5. Finally let us focus on three novels of the '70s. The first, Extraila Invasion (Strange Invasion, 1970) by Roberto von Bennewitz, exemplifies how not to write SF. It tells of the discovery at the center of the Andes of an unknown species of enormous scorpion. As they are edible, specimens are removed so that they can be bred domestically. Little time passes before they escape and proliferate, putting civilization in danger if every last one is not destroyed. Long, heavy, didactic, and boring, this book is interesting mainly from a bibliographic point of view. The second, by contrast, Carlos Ruiz-Tagle' s La Luna para el que la trabaja (The Moon to One Who Works It, 1979), is humorous and brief. Rather than being a novel, it is more a collection of letters and various documents concerning the conquest of space by Chile in the more or less near future. If the eminently satiric side of this short work is the most prominent one, that is probably because it was destined for internal consumption; indeed, numerous allusions are in effect inac- cessible to a foreigner. In any case, however sympathetic we may be to what he proposes to do, Ruiz-Tagle is fairly superficial. The same cannot be said of Mafiana hacia el ayer (Tomorrow Towards Yes- terday, 1975) by film maker, composer, and virtuoso Jose Bohr. It can be con- sidered as properly closing the "Golden Age" of Chilean SF, 1959-75. Not that the publication of SF in Chile has totally ceased since then; but Bohr is the last new author to have written a book in this domain. Bohr takes a subject already used by American George Allan England in The Elixir of Hate (191 1), and also by his compatriot ilda Caidiz in Cuenta Regres- siva (Story in Reverse, 1969). His long, slow-paced book is a kind of chronicle of the years 1903-35, and centers upon Julius Drive, a man who regains his youth. Starting at age 71, he suddenly regains his vigor, his virility, and a new set of (natural) teeth; presently he sets out to seek his fortune in America. At the same time, he also acquires the gift of prophecy: he predicts the death of Edward VII, sees the end of the Titanic, and is present at the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The mystery of his condition is revealed to him in 1910, when an inhabitant of Galas, the most powerful planet in the galaxy, tells him that he has been chosen to warn humanity of the dangers confronting it. Putting his prophetic powers at the service of his country (Great Britain), he leaves for Europe on a diplomatic mission to try to stop the next war. In spite of setbacks, he continues his monitory work, all the while going from middle age to adolescence to infancy. Without having attained his goal, he dies of youth in 1937. However, the life in reverse is not seen as a checkmate. More than Julius Drive's mission, it is his attitude</page><page sequence="8">188 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) towards his rejuvenation which is important: his rediscovery of passion and adven- ture, his doggedness and his vitality. The subject of the novel is a profoundly human story, lived and told in a personal way, almost independent of his mission. And when Julius Drive dies, the crowning incident is the apotheosis of his soul on Galas, where, thanks to the science of its inhabitants, he will know eternal life. The moral of this novel is eminently individualistic: live your life for yourself, not for the world. What more is there of Chilean SF after this last contribution to a (very rela- tively speaking) "Golden Age"? Only Aldunate and Correa have shown any activity in the field since. Also, the latter's novel was published quite recently- and in Spain, which was also the case for Arteche's. The discrepancy in the treat- ment of an SF vs. a "mainstream" author says a lot about the state of the market in Chile. What has become of the other writers of SF? How many manuscripts have remained unpublished? Deprived not only of the support of the editors but also of a specialized support, Chilean SF is nothing more than a memory. Espacio- Tiempo did not even have the time to establish a significant nucleus of amateurs. Only in Santiago is there a club where some diehards meet, but there is no editorial activity. The economic and political crisis has relegated Chilean SF to the back seat. It deserved better. Let us hope for a rebirth in the near future. NOTES 1.

(RMP) Abstract.-Chile could not lay claim to any indigenous SF until 1959. That year, however, marked the first appearance in print of Hugo Correa, who remains the most prolific as well as the best writer of SF that Chile has so far produced. Los Altissimos (The Superiors, 1959), his first book (of five, to date) is something of a classic, cer- tainly an auspicious beginning to a "Golden Age" of Chilean SF. Second to Correa is Antonio Montero Abt, with three SF titles to his credit- most notably, Aca' del tiempo (This Side of Time, 1969). But Montero apparently ceased writing after 1970, and no one else of talent among his compatriots has since devoted her or himself to writing SF exclusively and in quantity. There is, perhaps predictably, one renowned "mainstream" author, Miguel Arteche, who momentarily condescended to an S-F future history, El Cristo hueco (The Empty Christ, 1969). And among the SF books of the '60s, those of Armando Menedin, Elena Aldunate Bezanilla, and Ilda Ca'diz Avila deserve mention, even though they have written little and that little entirely in the form of short fictions. So, too, among '70s' writers, Carlos Ruiz-Tagle and Jose' Bohr can be singled out, espe- cially the latter for his Maniana hacia el ayer (Tomorrow Towards Yesterday, 1975). And finally, just for the record, there also exist some execrable SF stories by Roberto von Bennewitz and Rene' Peri Fagerstrom. Chile's "Golden Age "has proved to be short-lived: it lasted until about the time of Allende 's overthrow-until 1975, to be precise-since which time SF activity in the country has virtually come to a complete halt.
