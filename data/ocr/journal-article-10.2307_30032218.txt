The regular absence from the Iliad of mortal awe and divine awesomeness at such moments has perhaps encouraged 1 Key differences in how mortals perceive gods in the Odyssey prevent me from including that poem in this paper. I hope to write a second article, entitled "Perceiving Odyssean Gods," soon. a &amp;Xv 5' au' toa &amp;n' 6p0eaXpwv Xov, i npiv nfiEv, / 5&amp;pp' Ei ytyvW'KTjq Tv 0E6v i165 Kai av6pa (I1. 5.127-128). The mist Athena describes is unique; in all other scenes the gods envelop whomever they want to conceal in the mist. with Clay 1983:16-18, I take this single instance as a metaphor illustrating the limitations of mortality, including the inability to perceive the gods. The Iliad regularly connects the ability to see with life and the loss of sight with death, particularly in formulas describing a hero's death. Cf. II. 1.88, 5.82-83, 5.696, 13.671-672 etc. See Griffin 1980:44, Foley 1991:150-154, and Constantinidou 1994:6 on the connection between blindness and death. 3 The best general examination of epiphany in ancient Greece is still Pfister 1924:277- 323. Also see Pax 1962:832-909, and Versnel 1987:42-55. The Greek word epiphaneia encap- sulated a broad range of interactions with the gods. Any sensory experience that proved the immediate presence of a divine force, including dream visions, auditory experiences, and miraculous events, could be called an epiphaneia. See in particular Richardson 1974 on lines 275 and following for divine scent as an element of epiphanies. Though the concept existed long before Homer, the term itself first appeared in the fourth century, was not regularly applied to divine manifestations until the Hellenistic period, and first became a fixed theological term only with Christian writers. The Homeric poems only rarely use phainesthai of manifestations of the divine (Il. 1.198, 5.867, 20.131; Od. 7.201, 16.159, 16.161, 24.448), and the term only means "to become manifest" during an epiphany in II. 1.198 and Od. 16.15. Though the word epiphaneia may postdate the Homeric poems, the phenomenon can be traced back in Greece to the Mycenaeans and Minoans, and in the Iliad outlines a more or less definable family of encounters between humans and gods.</page><page sequence="2">Daniel Turkeltaub many to argue that the poem lacks numinous religious sentiment4 and instead presents the gods scientifically, as mere literary devices that explain human emotion, represent natural phenomena, and create particular literary effects.5 But the generalized proximity of the divine and mortal figures is an illusion created by the poem's focus on the great heroes. Because Athena describes the mist as an individualized phenomenon, as something which does not so much conceal the gods as wrap mortal eyes in a shroud that marks their mortality, the mist is liable to differ from mortal to mortal. In fact, only the greatest heroes ever experience epiphanies, while for the common soldiery the gods always remain distant and mysterious, objects of reverence and awe. Nor does a simple dichotomy divide the great heroes from the masses who follow them. The different means by which heroes perceive gods suggest instead that the metaphorical mist that marks their mortality has degrees of transparency, and hence that the modes of perception in divine epiphanies correlate with heroic levels or grades. 4 Though the gods' general lack of a clearly numinous character certainly colors the debate (see in particular Griffin 1980:144-178 and Clay 1983:134-138), the main argument concerning their religiosity centers on their "immoral" behavior specifically. For many scholars, divine farce inherently precludes the numinous augustness that characterizes religious gods. For refutations of the Homeric gods' religiosity, see in particular Nilsson 1925:148-179 and 1933:266, Mazon 1948:208, Scott 1921:174-179, Gernet and Boulanger 1969:27-28 and 95-96, and Redfield 1975:76-78 and 225-233. In defense of the Homeric gods' religiosity, see in particular Guthrie 1950:118-127, Kullmann 1956:81-82 , Kirk 1975:292, Lloyd-Jones 1971:10, Dietrich 1979:129, Griffin 1980:162-163 and 188-204, Erbse 1986:2-4, and Lynn-George 1996:8. These lists are by no means complete, as it would be impossible to reference every discussion of this issue here. s Homer's ancient critics generally condemn his particular depiction of the gods as fatuous, but do not claim that they are irreligious. By trying to persuade others not to believe in them, these ancient critics depict a world in which people regularly did believe that Homer's gods were identical to the gods of their own religion, as Herodotus 2.53.2 indicates. See in particular Xenophanes B1, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16 DK, and Plato Rep. 2.377d-383c. Others, beginning with Theagenes and Metrodorus, felt not that Homer's gods were corrupt representations of real deities, but rather that the stories about them must be decoded to disclose the truth, and so resorted to allegorical interpretations of Homer's poetry. Among later writers, both Sallustius in On the Gods and the Universe and the Homeric Problems ascribed to Heraclitus make it painfully clear that they are decoding or interpreting the Homeric gods in order to save them against the slander of immorality. This subject is vast, and there is no space to explore it here. See Lamberton 1986 and the collected papers in Lamberton and Keaney 1992. 52</page><page sequence="3">Perceiving Iliadic Gods In this paper I hope to prove that Iliadic epiphanies, identifiable as moments when mortals both perceive gods6 and recognize their divinity, can be divided by mode of perception into families, and that the Iliad uses each family only in particular circumstances and for partic- ular effects.7 The families of epiphanies naturally form a hierarchy of increasing proximity to a complete and unmitigated perception of the divine," and so reflect gradations in the poetic aggrandizement of the mortal witnesses or percipients.9 Though it falls outside the scope of this paper, it is worth noting that in some cases the difference between the modes of perception in two thematically linked epiphany scenes invites a comparison of the scenes; the hero who experiences the higher mode is revealed as greater than the other hero, and his actions correspondingly bear greater weight. Because the heroes as the Iliad presents them are given relative honor by their poetic contexts, the stratification of heroes and of scenes are inextricably intertwined-to prioritize Achilles' decision not to kill Agamemnon over Odysseus' to stop the Achaean exodus based on their respective modes of perceiving Athena is simultaneously to glorify Achilles over Odysseus at that moment.1' Note too that the perception of Athena that allows Odysseus 6 Unless qualified, by "perceiving a god" I mean "having a sensory experience of a god," and by "recognizing a god,"' the realization that the god is a god, not the identifica- tion of the specific god. The gods' many disguises and Hector's question to Apollo--rig Ea 06 Eoot &lt;ptiporE 8ECV, 'q p' e ipEcat avrlv; (II. 15.247)-attest to the difference between perceiving a god and recognizing his divinity, as well as the difference between perceiving the god and recognizing his specific identity. On this issue, see Dietrich 1983:54 and 65-66 and Turkeltaub 2003:30-31. 7 We should therefore think not of epiphanies as discrete from each other, but rather as comprising a single group of genetically related events. Together they constitute what Lord would call a theme (Lord 1960:68-69), but in this particular case I would prefer to call simply a "narrative pattern." On this term, see Turkeltaub 2003:16-50. This hypoth- esis runs counter to Seward 1991:18 and Piettre 1996:50, who both claim that epiphany scenes are too disparate to be iterations of a single theme or type-scene. 8 Or at least as unmitigated as any perception of the divine can be. See Pucci 1998a:70. 9 Janko 1992:2 writes that "Homer exploits the gods' interactions with mortals as a metaphor for, and a guide to, the response of the human audience. Divine spectators may dignify the battle below by deeming it worth watching, and may glorify a warrior by aiding him ... Divine involvement is a major sign of the significance of an event and of how we should view it" Also see Griffin 1978:1-22 and Griffin 1980:179-204. 10 The relationship between these two scenes has been discussed by Pucci 1998b:84-96 53</page><page sequence="4">Daniel Turkeltaub to countermand Agamemnon's commands to abandon the war is of a higher order than the perception of Oneiros that leads Agamemnon to issue those commands. The poem later uses the same basic technique to stratify Achilles and Hector in their duel. The epic relies on its audi- ence's religiosity to create this effect, and so even though its gods are poetic devices, they are poetic devices powered by the audience's belief that they are identical to their own objects of worship. This examina- tion will bring to light both a system of poetic patterning and the reli- gious sentiment that serves as the basis for that system. It is important to remember, however, that every scene has its own individualizing tone and themes, and in laying out a general pattern for them all I do not mean to trivialize the vast differences between them. Analyses of every scene's individualizing poetics would be too extensive for this forum, which will be restricted to outlining only some general trends in the underlying precepts on which the poem operates. Because we are dealing with poetic constructs, our understanding of the poetic medium limits our understanding of the percipients' experiences. With this in mind, I do not want to assume, for instance, that, just because the poem only says that Odysseus UVyrllKE 0~E 6taTI &lt;povrlaonrl (II. 2.182), he does not see Athena as well. To read Homeric epics in this way would be to treat them as literary works in which the events only exist to the extent that they are created by their texts." Research into Homeric narrative patterns suggests, however, that the and Turkeltaub 2003:131-132 and 223-224. Yet because mode of perception is only one of several factors that determines how forceful an epiphany scene is, it would be vain to attempt to use it to compare epiphanies that are not immediately juxtaposed in some fashion, and even in these cases it should not be the sole point of comparison. 11 It is best here to think in the narratalogical terms used by de Jong 1987:xiv, who in turn uses the terminology of Bal, Narratologie: Essais sur la signification narrative dans quatre romans modernes (Paris 1977). The fabula is "a chronological series of events caused or experienced by characters in a fictional world." The story is "the elements of the fabula as perceived, ordered, and interpreted by a focalizer." The story is the version of the events from the particular perspective taken. The text is "the focalized story ... put into words by a narrator." This is the language we read or hear that communicates the story of the fabula to us. Using the more general terms "point of view" and "perspective" for "focal- ization," Rabel 1997:1-8 provides a brief but excellent summary of the academic develop- ment of this field in relation to Homeric studies through 1997. 54</page><page sequence="5">Perceiving Iliadic Gods text often omits events to de-emphasize rather than exclude them,'2 and that their existence may have been implied for audience members fluent in all the nuances of the Homeric Kunstsprache.13 The families of epiphanies therefore do not necessarily define the percipients' actual experiences, but rather what the poem chooses to emphasize for poetic effect. Because we are discussing here only those events the text depicts as being of poetic moment, scenes that do not make the mortal's recog- nition of the god entirely obvious must be excluded from this analysis."4 Though they would qualify as epiphaneiai, instances when mortals do not perceive a god (even in disguise), but witness phenomena that lead them to deduce a god's presence must similarly be excluded. Occasions when mortals incorrectly deduce a god's presence from suggestive phenomena (e.g. II. 5.185-186), when gods intervene in ways that could but do not cause their presence to be recognized, and events that in some cases are performed by gods but in others are not (weapons breaking, for instance) all suggest that including scenes without any perception of a god whatsoever would be precarious.'5 12 The theory has been presented in various forms by Scott 1921:153-155, Combellack 1941:63, Reece 1993:193, and Foley 1999:29 and 124. 13 In the case of Odysseus in Iliad 2, for instance, the formula &amp;yxo0 6' iolacqivrl in line 172 that describes Athena's position might also imply that Odysseus sees her. Though more research would be needed to prove this hypothesis, Iris' epiphany to Priam in Iliad 24 lends it some support. Like Athena in the second book, Iris in 24.169 ofi S T nap&amp; Priam when she speaks to him. Though the text of the encounter does not mention any visual experience, Priam later claims that he saw her face-to-face (Il. 24.223). His claim suggests that visual experiences may be implied in epiphanies in which they are not explicitly excluded, and moreover that the act of standing near a mortal might imply a visible manifestation. For other instances of lines that mean "stood close to" or some- thing similar occurring with visible manifestations of gods, see II. 2.20, 2.790, 3.129, 4.92, 17.582, 22.228; Od. 6.21 and 20.32. The notion occurs just as often when the text is unclear about the god's visibility: II. 5.123, 10.508, 11.199, 15.243, 18.169, 22.215, 24.682; Od. 15.9. 14 A prime and problematic example occurs when Poseidon rescues Aeneas from Achilles in Iliad 20.318-340 and then speaks to him. Because the scene is focalized through Poseidon and because Aeneas neither responds nor reacts, Aeneas' awareness of the god remains a mystery. Unable to determine whether Aeneas even realizes that a god has saved him, let alone whether he sees Poseidon or hears his voice, we must exclude the scene from this study even though it would be difficult to believe that Aeneas perceives nothing divine in this encounter. 15 Jorgensen 1904 lends further support to this approach by noting that the mortals in the Odyssey are only rarely able to identify which particular gods intervene in their affairs. 55</page><page sequence="6">Daniel Turkeltaub With this caveat in mind, we can distinguish five modes of recog- nizing the divine in Iliadic epiphanies, each of which will be exam- ined in more detail shortly: 1) the mortal perceives a disguised god and deduces the god's divinity only after the god has left (post factum recognition), 2) a god who is disguised or has hitherto not been explic- itly recognized announces his true identity (verbal recognition), 3) the mortal recognizes the god's voice (aural recognition), 4) the mortal sees the god (visual recognition),16 and 5) the mode of recognition is taken for granted and so not specified by the immediate text (unspecified recognition). These five modes of recognizing gods constitute a gradu- ated continuum of proximity to the divine, from epiphanies in which the mortal does not actually perceive any of the god's divine aspects and only deduces his divinity through an intellectual process after the god's departure, to those epiphanies in which the mortal perceives the godhead so naturally that the event is taken as a matter of course. The five modes of perception can be further grouped into two larger sets. In the lowest two modes the mortal never explicitly perceives anything recognizable as a god, and so must rely upon deduction or the god's self-identification. These epiphanies are associated with particular circumstances in the divine realm (the god's disposition, his autonomy, etc.), and so reflect less on the mortal and his situation than on the god and his. In the three higher modes the mortal perceives some aspect of the godhead directly. These epiphanies coordinate with the particular nature of the mortal percipient and sometimes with a particular situation on the mortal world. We could say that the divine determines the first set, the mortal the second. The correspon- dence between the extent of perception and the sphere of concomi- tant circumstances is by no means coincidental. The perception of a godhead exalts the grandeur of the mortal percipient, and so it makes good sense that the context should focus on him rather than on the god. with the parameters set, let us now turn to the specific families of epiphanies. 16 For the Greeks, vision was regularly thought superior to hearing. See Clay 1983:12- 13. Later (1981:19) she distinguishes between divine knowledge based on vision (Ei'Eval) and human rumor based on hearing (KXMoq). 56</page><page sequence="7">Perceiving Iliadic Gods (1) In post factum recognition the mortal perceives a disguised god, and only realizes the god's divinity after the encounter has ended. Though he may feel the effects of having encountered a god, he never perceives the divine directly. There are two clear instances of post factum recognition in the Iliad: in AI. 13.68-75 Ajax deduces that "Calchas" was really a god (Poseidon) from his own newfound eager- ness to fight and the size of the god's footprints,'7 and in II. 22.296-301 Hector realizes that his now vanished brother "Deiphobos" must really have been Athena. To these two clear examples, I would add a third somewhat less obvious one: Patroclus' realization that Apollo disabled and disarmed him before his death. Though Patroclus does not recog- nize Apollo before the attack (II. 16.789) and is rendered senseless by the attack (II. 16.805-806), he nonetheless deduces his assailant's iden- tity before dying and so before the end of the scene (II. 16.844-849). Not just Patroclus, but in fact each of the three characters who recognizes a god's divinity after the god has successfully duped him ends up being killed by the god either directly or indirectly.18 Apollo's and Athena's epiphanies to Patroclus and Hector lead directly to the two most crucial death-scenes in the Iliad, and though Poseidon actu- ally strengthens Ajax during his epiphany, Ajax's post factum recogni- tion nonetheless foreshadows his future demise at Poseidon's hands. Nor is this pattern limited to what could be strictly termed post factum recognition-the motif underlying this manner of recognition also colors Achilles' recognition of Apollo when the god disguises himself as Agenor to lure Achilles away from the Trojans (II. 21.544-22.20). Achilles' discovery ofApollo's identity only after the ruse has succeeded 17 There is some debate over whether Ajax sees the footprints or the back of the god's legs. I find myself persuaded by Janko's argument (1992: on 13.70-72) that the genitives nto7OWv iSk Kvrlpadov (II. 13.71) describing Poseidon's Yxvta are pleonastic and simply mean "feet" (cf. I. 17.386). With this understanding, the problem of how lower legs could leave footprints disappears and we are free to construe 'Xvia as "tracks" in accordance with its normal usage. 18 The initial success of the god's disguise is crucial to this phenomenon. Even though Aphrodite and Apollo are disguised when they appear to Helen and Aeneas, the mortals recognize them immediately (II. 3.396-397 and 17.338-389) and so the same dynamic does not apply to these cases. The same pattern extends even to some cases in which the mortal never recognizes the god. Pandarus, for instance, is tricked by Athena and is later killed by Diomedes, whose spear Athena drives through Pandarus' nose (Ii. 5.290-291). 57</page><page sequence="8">Daniel Turkeltaub prefigures his death at Apollo's hands, as foretold by Hector (II. 22.359- 360).19 Hector's realization that his own death has been sealed by Athena's deception (II. 22.299-305) reveals the thematic operations of this sort of epiphany: though gods can conceal their identities from mortals and remain innocuous,20 when a mortal recognizes a god after being deceived, the god's disguise becomes neither a means to remain anonymous nor to appear in a perceptible form, but to mislead, trick, and ambush. In displaying the mortal's utter impotence before the god to both the audience of the poem and to the mortal himself, the disguise, in conjunction with the revelation, not only evinces the gap between mortal and divine that makes its existence possible,21 but also forces the mortal to realize both the limits of his own paltry mortality and that his patron gods have abandoned, or will abandon, him to the assaults of their adversaries. (2) With verbal recognition the mortal again does not explic- itly perceive the divine, but he does not need to rely on deduction to surmise the god's presence because the god explicitly introduces himself. It is precisely the deliberateness of the disclosure that elevates this mode above post factum recognition. In post factum recognition both the audience and mortal percipient remain unsure of whether or not the god cares about the percipient's knowledge of the encounter, and so the interaction remains in that sense one-sided. The tenor is quite different for both the audience and the percipient when they know that the god wants to be recognized. Whereas post factum recog- nition may seem incidental or even accidental, the intentionality of verbal recognition indicates not only that the gods deem the mortal and his actions significant enough to warrant their attention, but that they also deem him worthy of knowing that he has been singled out for such honor. 19 Though colored by the post-factum recognition pattern, the text leaves the means by which Achilles recognizes Apollo here unspecified, and so the scene belongs in the fifth group. See n51 and p70 below. 20 Smith 1988:166-167. 21 The gods cannot conceal their presence from each other so easily. Hera must trick Zeus into falling asleep so that Poseidon can enter the battlefield, and Athena needs the help of Hades' helmet to conceal her presence from Ares (II. 5.844-845). On this point, see Clay 1983:15. 58</page><page sequence="9">Perceiving Iliadic Gods The Iliad contains five epiphanies with verbal recognition: at 2.16-26 Oneiros appears to Agamemnon as Nestor22 and instructs him to attack the Trojans, at 11.195-213 Iris tells Hector to abstain from battle until Agamemnon has been forced to withdraw, at 24.160-188 Iris bids Priam to ransom Hector's corpse from Achilles,23 and at 24.341-469 Hermes escorts Priam across the battlefield and through the Achaean camp to Achilles' hut before revealing his identity to him and returning to Olympus.24 Apollo's epiphany to Hector beginning at II. 15.220 combines verbal recognition and unspecified recognition, and so reflects the trends of both groups. In all instances of verbal recognition Zeus sends the god to the mortal with a specific task to perform, and, so long as 22 As Dream, Oneiros must assume a form that Agamemnon might plausibly dream about. Robert 1950:33-34 notes that Agamemnon frequently obtains Nestor's advice, and so the particular identity of Oneiros' disguise makes his statements more persuasive by adhering to the dynamics of Agamemnon's normal advisory structure. 23 Priam's recognition of Iris in 24 is verbal, but problematized by his fear. Iris stands next to him and speaks uzrObv &lt;p~Eyf apivrl" tv S~k p61ppoo XraIE yuicra "e~polt, Aap5avi6rl fpipapE, (ppoi, pi E rit nipfEt'" (Ii. 24.170-171) before identifying herself as Zeus' messenger (IL 24.173). Priam's fear suggests that he recognizes her divinity before she identifies herself, and the order of the clauses suggests aural recognition. But then how could Iris' first words, the very words that must frighten Priam, already assuage his fear? Though such assuagements are traditional (Richardson 1993: on 21.288, 24.153-154 and 171-174, and Turkeltaub 2003:33-34), they always respond to rather than anticipate the mortal's fear or address another fear entirely (Turkeltaub 2003:225-227), and since mortals in the Iliad are never frightened by personal divine epiphanies elsewhere, Iris has no basis on which to anticipate Priam's reaction. He could recognize her before she speaks in some other way, and later claims to have seen her face-to-face (II. 24.223), but he says this to persuade Hecuba more effectively, and so we cannot retroactively classify his recognition of Iris as visual. Scott 1921:162 discusses how thematic differences between scenes lead to apparent contradictions of this sort. The problem vanishes if Priam's fear does not denote recognition, however. Because "the force of the divine presence on the human psyche rather than the knowledge of the divine presence ... directly triggers the [mortal's] intense emotional response [to the god's epiphany] ... it is a sensory reflex that bypasses and in some cases paralyzes the mortal's cognitive faculties" (Turkeltaub 2003:31-32), Priam's fear need not indicate a conscious recognition of the goddess (cf. II. 24.258-260 where Priam fears Hermes without realizing his divinity). It could just as well indicate surprise and the fragile state of his psyche after Hector's death instead. Priam's obvious grief would also explain how Iris could anticipate his response (contra Turkeltaub 2003:225n487). 24 The need to maintain the somber atmosphere of the scene and the monstrous impression of Achilles further determines the type of recognition used here. See Turkeltaub 2003:210-212. 59</page><page sequence="10">Daniel Turkeltaub the god does not first ask Zeus' permission to intervene, such circum- stances always produce verbal recognition if there is an epiphany. The gods in the first three scenes are minor deities without great religious significance25 and, with one exception,26 never act unless at the behest of another, whose messages they convey verbatim. Because they serve as little more than Zeus' mouthpieces in these scenes, they omit their own names and identify themselves only as his messengers.27 Hermes in the last book also acts at Zeus' behest, but because his individual- izing personality rather than Zeus' command shapes the scene,28 he identifies himself not only as Zeus' emissary but also as an indepen- dent god: iitol ~yto 086 Eiporoq EiX'jXouoa, / 'EppEiaq (II. 24.460-461). Apollo similarly identifies both himself and the god who sent him (Zeus) to Hector (Ii. 15.254-257). Though the mortals' situations vary greatly among the instances of verbal recognition, even to the extent that Hector's situation in Iliad 15.220 and following causes the epiphany to belong to another group as well, the divine context in these scenes remains constant. This is not the case in the higher set of epiphanies, to which we now turn. (3) The lowest mode of recognition in the higher set of epipha- nies is aural recognition, in which the text explicitly states that the mortal hears the god's voice29 and so perceives him and recognizes his divinity directly. Beyond the honor of perceiving an actual aspect 25 On Iris, see Erbse 1986:54-64. 26 No one sends Iris to lead Helen up to the walls in Iliad 3.121-145. 27 Oneiros tells Agamemnon and Iris Priam "At6q 56 rot iyyeX6 Eipt" (II. 2.26 and 24.173), and Iris tells Hector "ZE6 LPE naIrCp IpoETlKE TEtV rd iS~ Tu0rio8tc0at" (II. 11.201). 28 Zeus sends him to guide Priam not because he is a messenger-god, but because he takes pleasure in guiding those mortals whom he wants to help (Il. 24.334-335). Hermes' task is more complicated than either Iris' or Oneiros', and instead of receiving specific instructions or a fixed message from Zeus, he only receives the barest outline of instruc- tions (Il. 24.336-338) to carry out as he thinks best. His gentle behavior, words, and atti- tude in comforting Priam and guiding him to Achilles' hut express his own nature rather than zeus'. He returns to Priam and leads him home not because Zeus told him to do so, but apparently because he wants to. On the relationship between this scene and Iris' earlier in the book, see Erbse 1986:69. 29 On the nature of divine voices in particular, see Clay 1974:129-136, who argues that the gods differ fundamentally in their demas and aude, which are normally human attri- butes (as opposed to omphe, which is divine voice as in II. 2.41). 60</page><page sequence="11">Perceiving Iliadic Gods of the godhead, aural recognition's directness suggests the mortal's familiarity with the divine, and such familiarity exalts him above those who need to deduce or be informed of a god's divinity. This form of recognition only occurs when the mortal is in the process of making a decision or has just made a decision that needs to be changed,30 and so it is the first mode we have seen that coordinates with the mortal's circumstances rather than the god's. In Iliad 2 Athena finds Odysseus hesitating to depart with the rest of the Achaeans, and admonishes him to stop the exodus. Though Athena never announces her identity, Odysseus nonetheless uvErlKe OER &amp;r31 qpovrldoaai'rlq (1I. 2.182), and this formula recurs when Athena interrupts Diomedes' memerizein scene in the Doloneia to tell him to return to the Achaean camp (Il. 10.512).32 Lastly, Hector explicitly hears Apollo's voice (Il. 20.380) when the god reverses his decision to confront Achilles. 30 For this reason these epiphanies, and particularly Athena's to Achilles in the first book, have been used to argue that the gods are nothing more than psychic phenomena. The earliest non-fragmentary argument for this view can be found in Heraclitus' Homeric Problems §19-20, though the theory goes back to Theagenes (A2 DK). Modern proponents of this view include Nilsson 1924:363-390, Dodds 1951:2-18, Snell 1953, Otto 1954:183-184, Kirk 1974:292-293 and 1985:on 1.193-194, and whitman 1958:231. It has been opposed by Schrade 1952:149, Tsagarakis 1980:57-80, Lloyd-Jones 1971:9-10, Hooker 1990:25-32; Janko 1992:3, Redfield 1975:77, Heiden 1997:224, Pucci 1998a:77, Pulleyn 2000 on 1.194, and Turkeltaub 2003:148-151. Several scholars reach some sort of mediation between the two sides. Kullmann 1956:107-111 believes that the gods reveal the internal desires of the individuals, but do not allegorically represent those desires. Erbse 1986:70, 96, and 139-140 and Lesky 1961 assert that the gods cause mental changes without having their natures determined thereby. According to Cauer 1895:384 the Homeric epics present a series of theological strata. At the earliest layer, the gods were entirely anthropomorphic, independent entities, but by the end they had become amorphous and allegorical. Since the layers are still evident in Homeric poetry, he argues, both views can be supported. Seward 1991:70-78 summarizes the major trends in this area. These lists are by no means complete. 31 I do not include Iris' announcement to the assembled Trojans in the second book as an instance of aural recognition because Hector in 2.807 ('"EK-r0p 5' o' 0T EZSa TtOq hlyvotiraev) does not explicitly recognize Iris' voice, her ops, but only her speech, her epos. This distinction may be inconsequential, and if it is, it should be noted that the scene exhibits characteristics of this group: the Trojan leaders are assembled and awaiting news from Polites about the Achaean forces before deciding what to do. Much like in the other aural recognition scenes, Iris' speech influences a decision about how to act. 32 For a more detailed analysis of the applications of this sort of epiphany, see Pelliccia 1995:220-234. 61</page><page sequence="12">Daniel Turkeltaub Unlike epiphanies of the first two modes, which can occur to any hero, the three characters who experience aural recognition are all particular favorites of the gods-though the gods help other heroes, no hero who is not a god's direct offspring can boast such consistent divine partiality as these three figures enjoy-and they are held in such high esteem not because of any specific actions they have done or will do (which would render such affection temporary), but rather due to their own inherent natures. In this sense Homer presents them as intrinsically superior to most other heroes, though by having those experiencing postfactum recognition suffer circumstantial animosity, he does not present them as intrinsically inferior. Athena favors Diomedes most explicitly because he is Tydeus' son33 and Odysseus because of his craftiness.34 Her ire against Hector, on the other hand, is not caused by anything inherent in his person and so in no way reflects on his own worth-it is an extension of the anger Paris earned by awarding Aphrodite the prize of beauty (II. 24.25-30).35 Similarly, Apollo's affinity for Hector transcends any such temporary causality36-he remains 33 Diomedes notes in II. 5.115-117 and 10.84-291 that Athena particularly favored his father. Athena's particular and regular support of Tydeus was a widely recognized aspect of his character (Ii. 4.390), even to the extent that she planned to make him immortal, but changed her mind when she found him eating Melanippus' head (Apollodorus 3.76). Athena helps Diomedes wound two gods, a feat that no other hero in the epic attempts to rival (not even Achilles, who in 22.19-20 expresses his desire but inability to harm Apollo). In the funeral games she helps him win the chariot race by returning the reins to his hands, strengthening his horses, and breaking Eumelus' chariot (II. 23.388-393) even though he does not pray to her for help. 34 Od. 13.296-297 and 332. In Od. 1.60-61 Athena also notes Odysseus' piety, which Zeus acknowledges (Od. 1.66-67). In the Iliad, Athena helps Odysseus win the footrace by making his limbs light and by causing Ajax to slip in cow manure (II. 23.771-776). Diomedes selects him as his companion in the Doloneia because Athena favors him in particular (II. 10.245), and when Odysseus later prays to Athena for help he reminds her that 7 rE pot aidE / Ev tnwvEot ant6votot tcaptiaaoatc, o5E oE ot1'O) / KlV6}IEVOR (Il. 10.278- 280). The particularly close nature of her relationship with him is evident throughout the Odyssey, and is discussed explicitly by Nestor (Od. 3.221-222), by Odysseus (Od. 13.314- 315), and by Athena herself (Od. 13.331-332). 31 The relevance of this story to the Iliad has been called into question, but Reinhardt 1960:16-36 successfully defends it. 36 Apollo favors Hector so much that he is willing to sacrifice Aeneas, another of his favorites, to save him from Achilles (II. 20.75-80). Nor does he favor Hector simply because he is Troy's champion. Even after Hector has died and so can no longer defend Troy, 62</page><page sequence="13">Perceiving Iliadic Gods steadfast in his support despite the fact that he shares Poseidon's reasons for detesting Priam's line (II. 21.441-460)-while his animosity towards Achilles seems to derive simply from their opposing alle- giances.37 There is something special about Diomedes, Odysseus, and Hector that simultaneously causes, is caused by, denotes, and is exalted by the divine favoritism they enjoy. Their ability to perceive and recog- nize their patron gods aurally when contemplating some action is merely a facet of this honorific complex. (4) There are three visual epiphanies in the Iliad, including what are perhaps the two most important epiphanies in the epic: Athena's epiphany to Achilles in the first book,38 which sets in motion Achilles' withdrawal from the war, and Aphrodite's epiphany to Helen in the third book,39 which recreates the initial seduction of Helen that began the war.40 Athena's epiphany to Achilles seems to be modeled on aural recognition-she interrupts his mermerizein scene to direct his deci- sion, and the scene as a whole resembles Athena's aural epiphany to Odysseus in the second book quite closely41-but it is augmented in accordance with the superior nature of the mortal percipient. The third visual recognition occurs during the battle over Patroclus' body in the seventeenth book. The Achaeans are on the verge of pushing the Trojans back behind their walls against Zeus' plan, when Apollo Apollo preserves his corpse from the rays of the sun while Aphrodite protects his body from dogs and anoints it with ambrosia to prevent Achilles from damaging it (II. 23.185- 191). Apollo beseeches the other gods to rescue Hector's corpse from Achilles because Hector was always diligent in his offerings (II. 24.33-34), and Zeus reiterates this notion (11. 24.68-70). The consistency of Hector's piety indicates that it should be viewed as an aspect of his personality rather than as a set of individual acts. Zeus also calls Hector piXatroq... Ed0i EoiopoTv o0i Av 'IXi Siyiv (Il. 24.67). 37 Reinhardt 1960:21 and Erbse 1986:169-171. Apollo rails against Achilles in order to convince the gods to save Hector's corpse (I/. 24.39-54), but by blaming Achilles' behavior on his grief, Apollo limits his attacks to Achilles' immediate behavior. 38 Athena is ot &lt;p xtvopvr" rtv 5' Mkaov oil rtq 6paTo (II. 1.198). It is perhaps prob- lematic that Athena "appears" to Achilles when she in fact stands behind him.

Though the text contains no verb of seeing, the attributes she recognizes could only be recognized by vision. 40 Lendle 1968:70-71, Lenz 1975:132-133, and Turkeltaub 2003:152-155. 41 See p53 above. 63</page><page sequence="14">Daniel Turkeltaub disguises himself as Periphas and encourages Aeneas to greater feats of valor. Aeneas recognizes him by sight despite his disguise (II. 17.333- 334), and tells Hector of the encounter immediately afterwards (17.338- 339). The Trojans recover their strength and reestablish the stalemate. All three of these percipients are hemitheoi, half-gods with one mortal and one divine parent.42 Though such characters may be deceived by disguised gods, when they do recognize gods they never experience a form of recognition lower on the hierarchy than visual recognition, and no mortal who is not a half-god ever experiences a form of recognition higher than aural recognition except under a very specific set of conditions we shall soon discuss. This gap between hearing a god's voice and seeing a god suggests an ontological divide between the hemitheoi and those who are genealogically further from the gods, even if only by a single generation.43 The distinction is further indexed by the particularly intimate relationship these figures share with the gods, and not necessarily with their own parents. Achilles refers to time he spent in the home of his grandfather Nereus (II. 1.396- 397),44 both Helen and Aphrodite indicate their familiarity with each other (II. 3.399-417),45 and Poseidon rescues Aeneas from Achilles (even 42 The bT scholion on II. 3.396-397 explains that only such characters see the gods: toiq Stoyeveot 5GorlXovrat oi OEoi, dq rTi 'EXEvrj. Also see Rose 1975:66 and Turkeltaub 2003:167n358. 43 The gods grieve for their children, but not for their grandchildren. Achilles can control his divine horses while other men cannot because he is the son of a goddess (II. 10.402-404 = 17.76-78). Hera rebukes Apollo for not holding Achilles in higher regard than Hector because the former's mother is a god, the latter's a mortal (Il. 24.58-63). Combatants in the epic can boast of their superiority by citing their parents' strength. In such comparisons divine parentage lends particular potency. Apollo reveals the impor- tance of divine parentage in persuading Aeneas to challenge Achilles by saying that his mother is a mightier goddess than his adversary's (Il. 20.105-106). Even though he is only one generation further removed from Zeus than his opponent, Tlepolemus discounts Sarpedon's divine parentage before their duel (II. 5.635-646), and Sthenelos cites Aeneas' divine parentage to dissuade Diomedes from attacking him (II. 5.243-250). 44 According to the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite 256-277, Aeneas was raised among the nymphs until he was five years old, though this upbringing is not mentioned in the Iliad. Iliad 13.465-466 says only that his brother-in-law Alcathous nurtured him when he was small. Janko 1992 on 13.463-467 writes that "like Alkathoos himself, the detail that he reared Aeneas was surely invented for its effect on the latter." 45 Clader 1976:13 and Kirk 1974: on 3.399.

The gods' disguises in these scenes are troublesome, however.47 If the gods want to hide their identities, then how can mortals see them? If Aphrodite and Apollo want to be seen, then why do they conceal their identities behind disguises? If they want to conceal their identities only from the surrounding mortals, then whey don't they only appear to their desired percipients, as Athena does in Iliad 1? Aphrodite's and Apollo's disguises might be superfluous to, and unjustified by, the plot, but they do effect the tenor of the passages by adding an air of decep- tion that renders the gods' intentions and the nature of Helen's and Aeneas' visions ambiguous. They see the gods, but we do not know whether or not the gods intend to deceive them, nor the precise nature of the mortals' visions.48 The gods' disguises cloud these epiphanies, 46 Ignoring Poseidon's stated affection in I1. 20.293-300, Redfield 1975:230 argues that the only reason Poseidon rescues Aeneas is to preserve the course of fate. Though this factor certainly contributes to his reasons (11. 20.302-308), discounting Poseidon's explicit statements would still not eliminate divine affection from Poseidon's motives, for Poseidon mentions that Aeneas is only destined to survive and rule the Trojans because Zeus cares for the line of Dardanus (li. 20.303-308). 47 Gods' disguises are problematic in any situation, and only become more so when the gods are perceived through them.

OEajv (1. 17.338), and so raises 65</page><page sequence="16">Daniel Turkeltaub and so distance Aeneas and Helen from the gods at the same time as their visual perceptions draw them closer to the gods. Athena's posi- tion behind Achilles also restricts his perception (II. 1.197) and so simi- larly calls into question the clarity of his perceptions, though on a more symbolic level that we shall soon discuss.49 (5) In the highest mode of perceiving a god, the mortal recognizes the god as naturally and inherently as he would recognize another mortal, so naturally that the poet does not even feel the need to specify how the recognition occurs. The fact of recognition in these instances is emphasized by the absence of its means from the text, from the very fact that the recognition, though made entirely obvious by the mortal's response to the god, is left unspecified. of the sixteen instances of unspecified recognition, eleven incite or occur during the greatest aristeiai, belonging to Diomedes in the fifth book, Hector in the fifteenth, Patroclus in the sixteenth, and Achilles in the twenty-first and twenty-second.so Of these, Apollo's epiphany to Hector in II. 15.220, as we have already seen, also includes aspects of verbal recognition, and Achilles' recognition of Apollo in 22 aspects of post factum recogni- tion.51 Five instances of unspecified recognition occur outside aristeiai, all belonging to Achilles.52 These two groups are not as distinct as they at first appear, as they share the fundamental similarity that all charac- doubts about whether he recognizes his interlocutor's specific identity or merely his general divinity. 49 It lends an ominous tone to the scene by alluding to Achilles' blindness to the conse- quences of obeying Athena. See Pucci 1998a and Turkeltaub 2003:132-135. 50 II. 5.114-134, 5.330-352, 5.431-446, 5.711-909, 5.846-867, 15.220-261, 16.698-711, 21.211-382, 21.272-304, 21.595-22.23, and 22.166-277. 51 Hector recognizes Apollo's divinity immediately, but must be told which god he is. Apollo, like Hermes in 24, is sent by Zeus with general instructions to fulfill as he wishes, and so identifies himself both as Zeus' emissary and by name (Il. 15.254-256). Achilles is duped by Apollo's disguise, but recognizes the god's specific identity when the god boasts of the ruse's success (II. 22.15). He will later be killed by Apollo and Paris. 52 Il. 1.351-430, 18.34-138, 18.165-202, 19.2-39, 24.103-142. Hermes' second epiphany to Priam (II. 24.679-694) continues his earlier one and so is not an independent mani- festation. For more on responding epiphanies, see Turkeltaub 2003:34-35 and, on this particular scene, 183. Athena's second epiphany to Diomedes in the fifth book and Thetis' epiphany to Achilles in the nineteenth are also responding epiphanies, but I have decided to discuss them in the unspecified recognition group because the epiphanies they respond to belong to this group, whereas Hermes' earlier epiphany to Priam does not. 66</page><page sequence="17">Perceiving Iliadic Gods ters who perceive gods in this fashion exist (even if only temporarily) at a higher metaphysical state than do their mortal comrades. During their aristeiai heroes are temporarily elevated to a semi- divine level,53 imbued with divine strength by the gods and often radi- ating light54 exactly as do the gods in the Homeric Hymns. They gain heroic honor by rivaling the gods, and so are regularly described as equal to a god, Saipovt looq or some similar construction.55 Such divine power can extend to the mortal's senses, allowing him to perceive and interact with the gods on their own level, which Athena's removal of the mist from Diomedes' eyes (II. 5.127-128) symbolically reifies. Yet because incomplete perception is an index of the gulf in power dividing mortals from immortals, and so is a vital component in epiphanies,56 Diomedes' elevated status and enhanced perception threaten to bridge that gulf and so eliminate the epiphanic nature of his subsequent inter- actions with the gods. His encounters with Aphrodite, Apollo, and Ares all lack the tenor of epiphanies57 because his enhanced state allows him to perceive these gods as though such perception were natural. Diomedes' ability suggests that for the moment he stands on the brink of apotheosis. Athena then truly does fulfill his prayer (II. 5.116-117) and imbue him with his father's power as she promises (II. 5.125-126), since this is precisely where Tydeus stood at his death. Just as his father perishes right at the brink of immortality, so too Diomedes verges on the divine only to have his mortality reasserted by Dione's prophecy (Ii. 5.406-415). This moment fusing apotheosis and death is the culmination of Iliadic heroism, linking hero as mortal and hero as immortal figure of cult through the poet's gift of posthu- mous kleos.58 The hero's aristeia, verging as it does on apotheosis and 53 Mueller 1984:129. 54 When Athena inspires Diomedes with strength at the beginning of his aristeia, for instance, a-i oi E'K K6pUe6q TE KCa aoarTi8Oq aK IIaTOV iEOp (II. 5.4). 55 Muellner 1996:12-17. He specifies the general comparison of a hero during his aristeia to a god by explaining that "the narrative makes it plain that the god whom the warrior incarnates and competes with is Ares himself" (12). 56 Turkeltaub 2003:13, 29-32, and 38-40. 57 Pucci 1998a:71 notes that they are magical rather than epiphanic in quality. 58 Nagy 1979 passim but especially 10§13. At int. §17, Nagy writes, "The hero's death is the theme that gives him his power-not only in cult but also in poetry ... when a hero 67</page><page sequence="18">Daniel Turkeltaub death, both creates and symbolizes the immortal poetic kleos that preserves and vivifies the hero's memory long after he is gone. Heroes who sit on the edge of death, who are about to attain immortality by passing entirely into the memory that is the provenance of the poet,59 transcend the real and become poetic figures, figures of poetry, with a corresponding insight into future poetic events. Both Patroclus and Hector prophesy the deaths of their opponents as they themselves pass into poetic memory. Patroclus' aristeia does not quite follow the pattern laid out by Diomedes', however, in that he receives no divine inspiration. Rather, he achieves the same elevated state by making himself a duplicate Achilles,60 and so his ability to perceive the gods with unspecified recog- nition derives from Achilles' unique ability to do so outside of an aris- teia. Though we might be tempted to cast out four of the five instances in which Achilles recognizes gods in this fashion because they involve his mother (Ii. 1.351-430,61 18.34-138, 19.2-39, and 24.103-142), none of the other hemitheoi in the epic is privileged with even a single word from his divine parent, let alone an actual epiphany.62 Nonetheless, the remaining instance, when Iris tells Achilles to save Patroclus' corpse and Achilles responds to her by name (II. 18.182), cannot be dismissed. If heroes during their aristeiai can perceive the gods without the means enters combat in the Homeric Epos, we are fully aware of the intense seriousness of it all: he will confront death." 59 Though several characters are concerned with how they will be remembered (II. 2.119, 3.287, 3.460, 22.305), Helen is particularly aware of her future immortality in verse (Il. 6.357-358). See Clader 1976:6-23, who notes that Homer depicts Helen symbolically as a poet in her own right and as such a symbol of kleos, and that Helen's associations with death and danger correspond to the inherent relationship between kleos and death. On the relationship between kleos and poetry more generally, see Nagy 1979:229-261. 60 whitman 1958:200 notes that during his aristeia, "Patroclus is playing the role of Achilles. For the moment, he has become Achilles, and acts much more like the great hero than like himself." This substitution led Dio Chrysostom (11.97-100) to propose that Homer manufactured Patroclus' role to account for Hector's ability to wear Achilles' armor without having killed Achilles. He concludes that in the actual war Achilles and not Patroclus must have sallied forth to stop the destruction of the ships and been killed by Hector. 61 In this scene Achilles invokes his mother with a prayer. 62 Aphrodite tries to save Aeneas in II. 5.318-343, but he has already been knocked unconscious by Diomedes (II. 5.310). 68</page><page sequence="19">Perceiving Iliadic Gods specified because they are temporarily elevated to a semi-divine level, then it seems that Achilles exists at that superhuman level all of the time.63 By temporarily replacing Achilles, Patroclus in a sense borrows his semi-divine status, and so can perceive Apollo. Achilles' permanent superhuman nature is reflected in his uniquely clear perceptions of the gods. He perceives three times as many divine epiphanies as any other hero, and is the only one to do so without his recognition explicitly limited in some fashion. When Athena first appears to Diomedes in 5.114-134 she responds to his prayer, and so he could deduce her identity from his invocation rather than by recognizing her independently. His insistence that he recognizes her (ytyv3aKh) oWG, Od, O6yatmp AtL6 aiyt6xoto [5.815]) when they next meet perhaps suggests as much. Because, in his prayer to Athena, Diomedes only claims that she helped his father (5.116-117) and does not mention any previous personal relationship with her, it is possible that he has never encountered her before himself.64 A similar effect is created in Apollo's epiphany to Hector in 15. Hector perceives Apollo, and moreover realizes that he is a god, but has no idea which god he is (Ii. 15.247), suggesting that he has never encountered Apollo before. When Apollo rebuffs Patroclus from the walls of Troy in II. 16.698-711, Patroclus' silence (he merely obeys the commands) precludes any indi- cation of the extent to which he recognizes the god. His withdrawal indicates that he recognizes the divine presence, and the parallel scene in II. 5.431-444 suggests as much, but his perception remains limited because the poet does not construct it for his audience. Though we could say that some of the epiphanies Achilles witnesses are similarly mitigated, closer examination reveals how the poem subtly maintains the purity of his perceptions. When Poseidon and Athena support Achilles against Scamander, Poseidon refers to Athena by name, but to himself only as 'yc' (Ii. 21.290), expecting Achilles to recognize him. Athena and Poseidon have responded to Achilles' prayer for help in 21.272-283, but that prayer could not help Achilles recog- 63 Whitman 1958:181-220 examines Achilles' proximity to the gods on a psychological or even spiritual level. 64 West 2003:9 notes that even though Homer knows of the Epigoni story, he "seems to forget that Diomedes has proved himself in a previous war." 69</page><page sequence="20">Daniel Turkeltaub nize Poseidon because he addressed it to Zeus. When Apollo identifies himself after pretending to be Agenor in order to lead Achilles away from the Trojans, Achilles calls him EKaEpyE (II. 22.15), and so indicates that he recognizes Apollo's specific identity even though Apollo only reveals his generic divinity to Achilles (Il. 22.8-13). The familiarity suggested by Achilles' ability to recognize the gods so freely can also be found in their casual treatment of him. Both his mother and Athena run "errands" for him while he waits-Thetis requisitions divine armor for him and Athena leaves him temporarily to trick Hector into fighting him-and though gods may lend other mortals strength or perform certain miracles to help them (guiding weapons, for instance), they never appear to anyone else with instructions to wait while they accomplish some task for him. While gods frequently bid mortals to act, they reserve the phrase atc KE TnOerlat (II. 1.207, 21.293, 23.82) for Achilles, which not only creates an air of respect,65 but also implies that he alone has the ability to refuse their instructions.66 Though gods never appear in groups to other mortals, Thetis comes with her entourage of Nereids to console Achilles in IL 18.65, and Poseidon and Athena appear together to Achilles when he is attacked by Scamandros. Elsewhere such group encounters only occur with other gods. 65 The phrase appears twice in the third person: when Thetis agrees to ask zeus to honor Achilles (II. 1.420) and when Nestor bids Patroclus to convince Achilles to reenter the war (II. 11.791). Both Thetis and Patroclus must persuade more powerful figures, and this extremely respectful phrase indicates their inability to compel that person to act. The phrase occurs only four times in the second person (II. 1.207, 21.293, 23.82; Od. 1.279). All three Iliadic occurrences involve a god (or the ghost of Patroclus in the last example) trying to convince Achilles to perform some action. The lone Odyssean example works similarly, in that Athena tries to convince Telemachos in the Telemachia to leave Ithaca to search for news of his father. In all cases, therefore, the line denotes a superhuman figure trying to convince the main character of the epic (or subsection of the epic) to do something. There is no reason why it should lose its deferential force when shifted from the third to the second person. 66 When he follows Athena's instructions not to kill Agamemnon, he does so not because she compels him, but because he realizes that if he performs this "favor" for Athena, she will heed his future requests: he tells her Xpi! 1v acpwitrap6v ye, 0e6, iToV eipooaoaacl KaC l TaXaEP rUrp e1 KEXOXAP4vov. q yap apEivov (II. 1.216-217). On his act as a decision, see Kullmann 1956:109, Morrison 1997:280-281, Pulleyn 2000 on 1.207-220, and Turkeltaub 2003:141-145. Never, save here, do gods make requests of mortals who quite so explicitly announce their expectations for future favors in return. 70</page><page sequence="21">Perceiving Iliadic Gods Iris' behavior towards him is perhaps the most telling. She treats Achilles almost as though he were another god, even to the extent that she acts as his messenger by delivering his prayer to the winds (II. 23.198-213)! Several unusual aspects of her epiphany to him in 18.165- 202 further illuminate his status. Though Iris' scenes usually begin with her receiving a message from Zeus,67 when she appears to Achilles not only does Hera rather than Zeus send her, but the poem also elides the preliminary scene and so precludes any assessment of whether she repeats Hera's message or whether she extemporizes. She must modify the instructions somewhat, something she never does elsewhere, for Achilles' inability to fulfill her first set of instructions compels her to formulate a new plan. In responding to Iris at all Achilles takes unprec- edented liberty with the goddess, since mortals never respond to her elsewhere, and while responding he addresses her by name and asks who sent her. His question not only indicates that he recognizes her, but also that he is familiar enough with her to realize that she must be conveying another god's message. Her unique failure to announce even her function suggests that she expects Achilles to recognize her, and her expectation is fully justified. These facets of the scene-Iris' input into the message, a two-sided conversation, the absence of the god's personal identification, and the percipient's recognition of her-estab- lish a rather informal tone to their conversation. Though they never occur elsewhere when she interacts with mortals, they do when she delivers messages to other gods,68 and so her encounter with Achilles resembles her missions to Poseidon or Thetis far more closely than her epiphanies to Hector or Priam. She treats Achilles, and he responds to her, almost as though he were a god himself. 67 There are only three exceptions to this rule. In 2.787 the poem only refers to Zeus' instructions without depicting them, and in the scene beginning at 3.120 it mentions no motivation whatsoever. When Iris conveys Achilles' prayer to the winds (23.192-213), the text does not relate the prayer, which she summarizes. 68 Whereas Iris always identifies herself as a messenger when she appears to mortals, when she delivers a message to Poseidon she mentions her function to explain her presence rather than to identify herself: &amp;yyEXirv rtvd Tor ... / Xh0ov 68Epo qcppouoa tnapal Atbq aiyt6xoto (I1. 15.174-175). She assumes the same familiarity when she delivers Achilles' prayer to the winds (II. 23.205-211) and when she speaks to Thetis (I1. 24.88). 71</page><page sequence="22">Daniel Turkeltaub The poem offers three interrelated explanations for the special treatment Achilles receives. Unlike Aeneas and Helen, who never interact with their divine parents throughout the poem (at least while conscious) nor provide any indication that they have done so in the past, Achilles freely associates with his divine mother and in his first conversation with her reveals that he spent time in his grandfather Nereus' home (II. 1.396). Because Achilles has visited gods in their own home and become familiar with them individually, he can now recog- nize them and is treated more intimately by them. His relationships with the gods since childhood also elevate him above his peers to some- thing between the standard heroes and the gods, and this elevated status in a cyclical manner sustains his personal interactions with them."' Ultimately, however, the poet creates both Achilles' intimate relationship with the gods and his semi-divine status because Achilles is the protagonist of the epic, and as such singled out for special honors. The close association he shares with the gods both explains his ability to perceive them and is in turn justified by that ability. The two ends of this circular relationship feed on each other to aggrandize Achilles. This is the divine half of his character, the half he inherits from his mother,70 the half that is so prominent in the Iliad that it often threatens to remove entirely the metaphysical separation that distances Achilles from the gods and that prevents other mortals from perceiving gods clearly."7 If Diomedes' interactions with Aphrodite, Apollo, and 69 Smith 1988:169 and Alvis 1995:23-27 also note that Achilles' intimacy with the gods rather than his bloodline affords him special treatment. Alvis argues that this special treatment is also his undoing, since Achilles wants to live like the gods and refuses to subject himself to another mortal (i.e. Agamemnon). His elevated status is also evident in the application of minis only to Achilles and the gods. See Alvis 1995:9 and Nagy 1979: chapter 5. Muellner 1996:2 and 106-123 observes that though the noun is only used of Achilles' emotions, the verb form is used for Agamemnon's and Odysseus' as well. Zeus' sanction, however, distinguishes Achilles' as true minis. 70 Slatkin 1991 explores how Thetis' other mythological traditions exalt Achilles above the other mortals at Troy while simultaneously reinforcing the inevitability of his death. 71 Alvis 1995:27 and 109 goes a step further in saying that the gods are jealous of being overshadowed or outdone both by Achilles (in the Iliad) and by Odysseus (in the Odyssey), and that their hardships result from these jealousies. His theory is difficult to accept, considering there are no overt references to any jealousy in the poems. Rather, the lives of all people, particularly in the Iliad, are depicted as more or less universally 72</page><page sequence="23">Perceiving Iliadic Gods Ares cannot properly be called epiphanies because Athena has momen- tarily bridged the gulf between him and the gods, then how can any of Achilles' interactions with any god at any time be so labeled when he does not even need Athena to remove the mist from his eyes first? Achilles' intimacy with the gods, and so his ability to perceive them, enables him to create the Iliad, for his ability to perceive the gods is symbolically his ability to perceive the greater workings of the universe and to know the imminent death that drives him to withdraw from the war when his honor is threatened.72 Achilles alludes to his imminent death while complaining to Thetis about Agamemnon in II. 1.352, and she explains it more fully when she agrees to convey his request to Zeus (II. 1.415-418).73 It is through Achilles' close relationship with his mother and her family that he learns how Thetis can persuade Zeus to steer the course of the poem according to his desires (II. 1.396-412).74 It is then only through his proximity to the gods that Achilles sees the shadow of death that hangs over him and draws it closer around him by withdrawing from the war; the divine half he inherits from his mother forces him to face the mortal half he inherits from his father head-on.75 Though the gods treat him with more familiarity and respect than they do other mortals, his susceptibility to Scamander's attack and Apollo's trickery in the midst of his aristeia remind both Achilles miserable. Clay 1983:209 argues that Athena is jealous of Odysseus because he "is too clever; his intelligence calls into question the superiority of the gods themselves;'," but if Athena were jealous of Odysseus' cunning, then her animosity should precede the sack of Troy, since he displays his cunning before then. Both the Iliad and, more importantly, the Odyssey preclude this possibility, however (in Od. 13.314, for instance, Odysseus asserts that Athena was kind to him before Troy fell). 72 Slatkin 1991:25 notes that Proclus in his summary of the Aethiopis suggests that Thetis warned Achilles of his imminent death before he confronted Memnon, and that is the reason he withdraws from battle. 73 On these two references to Achilles' destiny, see Slatkin 1991:34-37. 74 Griffin 1980:163 writes, "Achilles has real foreknowledge of his own fate ... Achilles knows, because he is the son of a goddess, and she has told him; Hector is ignorant, because he is only a man:' Also see Slatkin 1991:44-48, who notes that Thetis reiterates and reinforces Achilles' destiny throughout the Iliad, and particularly in reference to the inability of Hephaistos' armor to prevent his death. In her next chapter, she discusses how Achilles can sway Zeus because Thetis has the power to stabilize and destabilize the cosmic order (Slatkin 1991:59-73). 75 Griffin 1980:163-164. 73</page><page sequence="24">Daniel Turkeltaub and the audience that he remains mortal even when at the height of his power. Athena's manifestation to him alone of the Achaeans in the first book may distinguish him as closer to the gods than his fellow heroes, but her appearance behind him simultaneously raises doubts about the completeness of his perceptions.76 Though he perceives enough to realize his own imminent death and to convince Zeus to fulfill his wish, he cannot perceive that his request will lead directly to Patroclus' death and his own disillusionment with the very honor he at first holds so dear.77 The dichotomy between Achilles' mortality and immortality, evidenced in his perceptions of the gods, creates the epic because it is in attempting to navigate between these two extremes that Achilles acts as he does.'8 Other heroes experience this unification of immor- tality and death only during their aristeia, but Achilles exists perpetu- ally on the boundary between apotheosis and death, and so is the embodiment or incarnation of the essence of aristeia. And aristeia, we see, is inherently tragic, as the hero is elevated to the brink of divinity, shown the glorious magnificence of the gods and allowed to sample the careless ease of immorality, only to be dragged down into misery and death by the chain of mortal ignorance and frailty that leads him to act in an unwittingly self-destructive manner. Achilles' illustrious ability to perceive the gods with unspecified recognition is ironically also an index of his great tragedy. Such regular coordination between the means of recognition and the contextual circumstances in epiphany scenes leads to the conclusion that the context of each scene relates paradigmatically to a particular mode of perception. I say "paradigmatically" rather than "formulai- cally" because this association does not indicate that the composition of the epic was in any way controlled by a preset recipe for poetic expres- sion. The three scenes that blend the circumstances and/or means of 76 Pucci 1998a:73. 77 On Achilles' disdain for kleos, see Griffin 1980:81-103. 78 whitman 1958:195 writes "Heroism cannot be maintained in isolation, or it becomes nothing. Though the heroic nature partakes of the absolute qualities of divinity itself, and though the higher it looks, the less it can endure the compromises of the human level, still its human connections alone justify it as a human phenomenon." Achilles' negation of heroism's two ties forms the core of whitman's chapter on Achilles' psycho- logical development. 74</page><page sequence="25">Perceiving Iliadic Gods recognition from different groups79 indicate instead the liberty with which the poet worked and that his modes of recognition were selected to create a desired thematic effect rather than elicited by direct asso- ciation with a particular set of circumstances. The relationship between circumstances and mode of recognition is therefore coeval, and if the two interact it is in parallel for the creation of a particular effect rather than causal. Patroclus' aristeia does not trigger his ability to perceive Apollo with unspecified recognition: his temporarily elevated state causes both his aristeia and, as part of his aristeia, his ability to perceive Apollo with unspecified recognition or, to speak in a more literary sense, both of these associated phenomena create the effect that Patroclus achieves semi-divine status when he dons Achilles' armor. Similarly, Odysseus' privileged relationship with Athena in one sense causes him to be the sole hero who contemplates staying in the second book and affords him the honor of hearing Athena's voice, but in a more literary sense that he contemplates staying and that he hears Athena's voice creates the goddess's favor. The consistency with which the Iliad uses the same circumstances with the same modes of perceptions therefore testifies not to a formulaic system that might govern its composition, but rather to a deep understanding of the subtle poetic effects of both the circumstances surrounding each epiphany and the ways in which the epiphany itself may be depicted. This understanding leads the poem to coordinate each mode of perception consistently with the particular set of circumstances that best complements its poetic effect. The cumulative effect of these various modes of perception across the whole of the epic stratifies the characters beyond the obvious two (gods and mortals) or three groups (gods, heroes, and common mortals) into five echelons: 1) Achilles, who perceives the gods inherently; 2) other hemitheoi, who may be honored with seeing the gods; 3) favored heroes, who may hear the gods' voices and have the gods advise their decisions; 4) standard heroes, who may experience divine epiphanies, but never explicitly perceive the gods; and 5) the common soldiery who never receive any individual attention from the gods. These levels 79 Athena's epiphany to Achilles in Il. 1.193-222, Apollo's epiphany to Hector beginning at II. 15.220, and Apollo's epiphany to Achilles in Ii. 21.595-22.23. 75</page><page sequence="26">Daniel Turkeltaub are poetic in that they are formed by poetic devices for poetic effect. In relying upon increasingly intimate interactions with the poetic gods, they make use of the audience's reverence for the real gods those poetic constructs represent to glorify the heroes, and so unite poetic experience with religious sentiment by drawing the audience's reli- giosity into the text. Without religious sentiment, Hector's ability to hear Apollo, Helen's ability to see Aphrodite, and Achilles' ability to interact all but openly with Athena would have no relevance per se, and so would influence neither their characterization nor their placement in the cosmic order of the Iliad. It would no longer matter how these characters perceive the gods, merely that they do so. But the regularity in the associations of the various modes of recognition attests to their importance to the poet at least, and so we must conclude that he did not distinguish between his gods as the divine machinery of his poem and his gods as objects of religious worship. These two aspects are so inextricably intertwined that one cannot function without the other. As the poet relies upon his audience's religious sentiment to affect his poetic art, he draws his audience into the tale he weaves so that they become immersed in it. The reality he creates overflows the bounds of his verse, as he creates not so much a distinct poetic world as his own image of the real world, which he uses to refashion and modulate his audience's awareness of their own reality and their position within that reality. The poet's invocation to the muse unifies the real and the poetic by making her simultaneously a character within the poetry and the source of the poetry itself. The poet's story consequently becomes that of a past reality rather than of a different reality as he extends the divine machinery of his poetry to the world outside his poetry, presenting it as a functional theology that empowers him to recite his poem. Within the theological system he constructs, he depicts the members of his audience, who presumably have never perceived a god directly, as on a par with the common soldiery of the Iliad, while he presents himself as a hero favored by the gods through the various invocations that consis- tently suggest that he hears the Muse's voice and so experiences aural epiphanies.8o By presenting its poet in such close communion with the 80 He invokes the Muse to sing or tell him the story in II. 1.1, 2.484, 2.761, 11.218, 14.508, 76</page><page sequence="27">Perceiving Iliadic Gods gods, the Iliad lends clout to the poet's words and makes him as much a figure of his own poetry, as much a divinely loved hero, as the greatest of his mortal-born characters. The distinction between poet and poetic narrator/character breaks down as the Iliad garners for its legendary poet/narrator the heroic status of such bards as Orpheus, Amphion, and Arion. His audience becomes his entourage, who both heed him as their leader and look to him as something more than human.81 UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME WORKS CITED Alvis, J. 1995.
