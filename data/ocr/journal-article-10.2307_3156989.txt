FOSTER, Cumberland University, Theological School, Lebanon, Tennessee. I. b. This is the oldest Semitic name of the Divine Being of which we have any knowledge. It is allied to the verb 1XK, to be stronig; and hence among the Semitic nations K, the Mighty One, is the name designating the Semitic conception of deity, or, rather, the gods; the polytheistic notion being if not the primitive, at least a very early, one, and power the dominant idea. It is applied for this purpose in no otherwise than in respect to strength, dominion, power. It was not an abstract notion of existence, nor of immortality, nor love, nor jus- tice, which was apotheosized, but power, and the authority which power implies. It need not be inquired here whence the notion came. It is sufficient to say that the Semitic nations considered it the type or manifestation of a being beyond themselves, and accordingly they named it tR, and worshipped it. Or it may have been a mutil- ated and distorted form of the doctrine'of the Divine Being trans- mitted to them from the beginning. ,NM is supposed to be only an etymological development of '., the original sense, therefore, being that of power. Thus, Gesenius, Ewald, Fuerst, and others. Another view regards it as a distinct word, and makes its root meaning to be terror, in which case ntK is the Being who inspires terror. But as this may be most easily con- ceived to be done by a manifestation of power, it may be said that the idea of power still subjectively inheres in ;riLN. It is found both inside and outside of the sphere of revelation. Dt', R also denotes might or power. It is found in none of the Semitic languages except the Hebrew. It is generally believed to have been invented by the Hebrews to express the infinite fullness of the might and power which</page><page sequence="2">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. lies in the Divine Being. Hence the plural form. The Deity so called was conceived of as the aggregate of many infinite forces, or powers. It hints at the mystery of the Trinity only so far as to fur- nish a foundation for that doctrine. From the Israelite point of view it is singular in sense, and is so construed grammatically; but it is also not infrequently applied from the polytheistic standpoint to the gods of the Semites and other peoples, being usually followed in such cases by an adjunct, as the name of the nation whose gods are meant; as "the gods of the nations," " the gods of the peoples," the " gods of silver." As the name of the true and most high Divine Being D';ifK is commonly, though incorrectly, rendered God. But the two words are by no means lexical equivalents; they designate the same Being,. but do not signify the same thing. Nations name their deity accord- ing to the attribute to which they attach most prominence. With one it is force or power, and then the deity is the Mighty One; with another it may be goodness; and then the deity is the Good One. The primitive significations of the names may, however, in process of time, entirely disappear, and altogether new ones attach themselves thereto.. So it has to come to pass that God has practically ceased to signify the Good Being; nor is it safe to suppose that KR awakened in the latter and more enlightened Hebrew mind precisely the same idea as in the case of the early. Hence the original, or root, meanings of words are not always the ones to be sought after. The antediluvian and pre-Abrahamic doctrine of God was probably a decay; the Hebrew doctrine of Him was a growth. Qualified by various other words, .K was used in the pre-Mosaic period to desig- nate the Hebrew conception of God. Confining ourselves in the selection of such qualifying words, to the ground form of the Pentateuch, wherein must be found, if at all, the theology of the patriarch, as contradistinguished from the latter theology of Moses, we may make out the early Hebrew doctrine of God, and its progressive development. Thus (I), God appeared unto Abraham and said, 'I am Almighty El," "ei LN. In Gen. XLVIII., 3, Jacob said unto Joseph, "'T KN appeared unto me, etc. " This name," says Oehler, " characterizes God as revealing Himself in His might"; equivalent to the Greek aavroipdatp, with which word the expression is commonly rendered in the Septuagint Book of Job, though not generally in the Pentateuch. " It is no longer the powerful Divinity ruling the world in general that is El Shaddai, but the God who testi- fies of Himself in special deeds of power"; not merely the God who, by his power rules nature, but the God who, to use the words of Delitzsch, "compels nature to do what is contrary to itself, and sub- 370</page><page sequence="3">TIE NAMES AND DOCTRINE OF GOD. dues it to bow and minister to grace." God subsequently revealed Himself as Jehovah, but in some sense at least, not so to Abraham; as in Ex. VI., 3: "I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai; as Jehovah I was not known unto them." According to Taylor's Hebrew Concordance El Shaddai occurs in Genesis fifteen times, and, according to Fuerst, in the pre-Mosaic book of Job, thirty- one times. (2). DiY. "And Abraham called there upon the name of Jeho- vah "; viz. D7iy tN, the Everlasting El (Gen. XXI., 33). The patriarchs knew Him, therefore, as the Almighty and Everlasting El, though possibly not yet as the only one. He is in some sense rather a tutelary El. " Jehovah, thy God, is one God," and the only one was a truth subsequently to be impressed, and a hard lesson to learn it proved to be. In Gen. xvI., I3 He is called KNI .R, not the El who has become visible to me, but the El to whom I am visible, the All- seeing El. To Isaac He appeared as the El of Abraham; to Jacob as the El of Abraham and Isaac, thereby contradistinguishing Himself from the god of the Canaanites, Phoenicians, Arameans, and other nations among whom, or contiguous to whom, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob lived. The name was afterwards nationalized as El Israel, the El ruling over, and recognized by the descendants of Jacob. So, therefore, the identity of the idea is preserved and transmitted, and God-so nearly the trite God only as is represented by these attri- butes-is known to all pre-Mosaic Hebrews as the almighty, all-seeing and everlasting El, though still, perhaps, not yet as the only one. They are yet not far from polytheism, and El is still tutelary. Thus far he has to them no moral qualities, so far as the names employed to describe Him are concerned. He does not become K3p N. the jealous El, the El jealous in the defense of his own honor, until Ex. xx., 5, He so announces Himself to Moses, and asserts it again and again in the peculiarity, and oftentimes the severity, of His educational dealings with Israel. He does not become D.In'l N, the tender, the compassionate, the merciful El, until He so reveals Himself during the same dispensation. In Deut. XXXII., 4, He is 1.ON. LN, the un- changeable, or faithful, El, on whom one may securely rely. By the post-Mosaic writers, KN is used interchangeably with 5y', as by the authors of the books of Samuel and Chronicles. Baal is also the Mighty one, and hence the Lord and Ruler over things in so far as he possesses them-the nom.en numinis of a great part of the Sem- itic races. It is also used interchangeably with 3N, as in Jeremiah II., 27, 28, the stock and stone being called 'N in the one, and '.1. -- 371</page><page sequence="4">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. an after form of .--in the other verse. With "17 it is the God of Eternity, the pater Clzronou of the early, or Orphic, Greek. It is also used interchangeably with II', or Vi, a characteristic name of El at a very early period. In the Chaldaean religion, it is the mystic and un- mentionable name of the mysterious deity enthroned above the seven heavens, representing the spiritual light principle, and also conceived as a demiurge, or world-creator. The Chaldean Yahu is the Phoenician Helios, Father of Light, with which Baal is also used interchangeably. 'X, according to Taylor (Heb. Con., Art. 1W), finds its Latin syn- onym in deus, according to the learned Pococke (Newton's Principia, Gen. Schol.) is derived from the Arabic di, Lord, one who possesses power and exercises it. Numen, I should think, is more nearly its syn- onym. Baal, however, though used interchangeably with El, is scarcely to be regarded as synonymous with it, except in intention. Baal is always El individualized, and more or less anthropomorphic, while El is Baal at one time or place, Yahu, El-Israel, etc., at another, not in itself representing in the minds of the nations any idea of distinct personality at all. e6c, in the Greek, was not always Zeus or Pater Chronou, though Zeus and Pater Chronou were always oE60. So, also, Neptune, the numen awquoris, is always Deus though Deus is not always Neptune, but sometimes Bacchus or Jupiter as well. There was nothing in Theos to limit the Greek mind to monotheism. The Greek offered neither praise, nor prayer, nor sacrifices, to Theos as Theos, but to Theos as Zeus, or Pallas, etc. Nor was there anything in Deus thus to confine the Roman mind, nor in the Teuisco, or rodera weard, of our Saxon ancestors. So far as the influence of the conception of the word El, of the Semitic dialects, is concerned, neither was there any- thing in it to determine the Hebrew mind to monotheism. Hence the method alluded to above of preserving the identity of the idea involv- ed in El. El said unto Jacob that he was the same El who appeared unto Abraham and Isaac. It was necessary that he should have said this, for Jacob is possibly not yet assured of his in all-comprehending unity. Joseph was high in authority and distinguished by piety, but he makes no missionary effort in behalf of the Egyptians. So far as the record states, we have no reason to believe that he was assured of the oneness of God. He worshipped the true God only as he recog- nized him, just as man does now. The El of Joseph, as Joseph con- ceived of him, seems to have been a tutelary El-the El of the Hebrews -whom he preferred above the El of his neighbors; and in the theistic controversy which afterwards arose between the Hebrews and the Egyptians, supremacy is the only item involved; and the supremacy so marvelously asserted and sustained in the contest by the Hebrew 372</page><page sequence="5">THE A AMES AND DOCTRINE OF GOD. El, is only one step in the process whereby the Hebrew doctrine of God is to become a more and more improved doctrine. Notice: El was identified on his second appearance to Abraham by Himself refer- ring to the circumstances and quoting the language of His first appear- ance. So, also, in the subsequent revelations which He makes to Abraham. In a similar manner he is identified by Jacob, and, further by declaring Himself "the God of thy fathers"; in Egypt, as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; while now, he may be identified additi- onally as the El, or God, "who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." If the idolatry of Aaron and the Israelites was not intended as an indirect worship of the same El, it was the worship of one whose existence they had not been called on to doubt, and whose worship they had not been called on to disown. The severity of the punish- ment inflicted for the idolatry illustrates the importance of the lesson to be learned. The process of unfolding the true character of God, and the character of the true God, must be carried forward. He im- plants the idea of his spirituality by prohibiting image worship, and the idea of his oneness by visiting upon his people severe inflictions when any other El is worshipped. That El is, they never doubted, but that El is one, and such as had been described must be declared to them by word and act again and again. It was never a contest between theism and atheism, but between polytheism and monotheism. Even at a later day in Hebrew history, Ahab did not deny that the El of Elijah was God. His sin was in asserting that Baal also was God, and in practically asserting his superiority. This was true among the Greeks and Romans; indeed, of every ancient nation of whose theology we have any knowledge at all. The Greek mind had no use for 086c without the 6, expressed or understood. It was not oe6^ did thus and so, but invariably o e,oc, some particular one of the gods. O6e was merely the the divinity in Zeus, Neptune, Pluto, etc., and the divinity in each was distinct from the divinity in all the others. The Theos in Zeus was merely a Greek conception of something above themselves, local- ized and labeled Zeus. So through the whole of the Greek polytheism. Among the Romans it was the same. Ovid could preserve intact his orthodoxy on the subject of Deus, and yet make the deus of Jupiter dethrone the deus of Saturn, and the deus of Mars wage war, and the deus of Bacchus get drunk. Among the Hebrews, theistic discussions in those days were as the discussions of church creeds in these days- intrinsically more important, perhaps, but illustrated by them, never- theless. It was no more difficult on the score of conscience for an ori- ental, or an occidental, to substitute the worship of one El, or Theos, for that of another than it is for a modern churchman to change his 373</page><page sequence="6">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. creed. A particular name is useful, of course, only in so far as it em- bodies a conception, thereby rendering it tangible, and enabling you to lay it away out of your consciousness and take it up again by name when you have use for it. It is right for me to worship the Divine Being, though as to whether it is right or not depends upon what sort of ideas I attach to the name by which I call him, for I can worship him only as I conceive him to be. If I should ascribe the wrong attributes, or a greater or less number of attributes, to him than he possesses, I would not be worshipping him as he is. God, in a sense, is to every man what that man conceives him to be. The advantage of a name is to unify and enable us to identify our ideas of him. I may ascribe to him too much of the merciful; you, not enough. Or I may ignore his mercifulness and regard him mainly as the Just One; while according to your conception of him he does everything arbitrarily whether it be just or unjust. One man may conceive of him as one living far back in the beginning of eternity, having wisdom and power enough to say that such and such things shall come to pass to-day. Another may conceive him as sitting wrapped in the whiteness of the ages, far up in the evening of eternity, with historical knowledge enough to know that such and such things did come to pass to-day. (And why would not one of these conceptions of him be as correct as the other?) Another may conceive of him as a nunc stans, living in the early morning, and noon, and evening of eternity at the same moment, all knowledge being with him a present knowledge. It matters not by what name we call him provided only our conception of him be cor- rect; and the more incorrect our conception of him is, the more nearly does our worship of him become the worship of Jupiter, or Zeus, or Fate, etc. The God of some theists, not to say some Christians, who hold a certain theory concerning the relation of God to the world, is not very far from being the God of the ancient Epicureans. The doctrine of God was more clearly unfolded and understood in the days of Elijah than it was in the days of Jacob and Joseph, though polytheistic views were still prevalent. The sin against which the prophet had to contend was not the denial of the existence of El, but the affirmation that there were more El's than one. Theism and not atheism is indigenous to the human mind. Man does not have to be reasoned into the belief of theism; he reaches it per saltum, and in spite of himself. He must go into his closet in order to reason him- self out of theism, if he can. But nations have no closets, and hence nations are never atheistic. I say El is because I cannot help it, and so it is with every man. Why should it be attempted to prove the ex- istence of One the belief in whose existence is intuitional or instinct- 374</page><page sequence="7">THE NAMES AND DOCTRINE OF GOD. ive, and in either case axiomatic ? Argumentation there must be, of course, but should it not rather be in order to a definite understanding and agreement as to the character of God. and not as to his existence, otherwise I may name my conception of him Fate or Force, and you may name yours El or deitas or God, all agreeing, perhaps, in no other respect than in that of existence. The object of God in the tui- tion of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the race of Israel, was not to re- veal his existence, for they could not deny that, but to make himself more distinctive, and to inculcate an improved knowledge of his char- acter, as will appear from a brief consideration of his Mosaic name, to-wit: II. m1,v The introduction of this name is the beginning of a new era in Hebrew theology. God appears in the flaming bush to Moses and calls himself the El of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, and "the El of thy fathers," thereby enabling Moses to identify him, and distinguish him from the El as conceived of and worshipped by other nations. Had he merely spoken, without thus introducing himself, what could have hindered Moses from believing that, if an El at all, he might be the tutelary El of Midian, rather than the El of his fathers? for it is not clear from the record that Moses at this period of his life was quite free from polytheism. He also gives himself the name Jehovah, which must be linked in the Hebrew mind to the old conception of the na- tional El, by Moses' calling him, not merely Jehovah, but "Jehovah the El of thy fathers;" otherwise, the Hebrew might naturally regard him as some new and unfriendly god of whom Moses might have learned during his long absence from them. The word MnlT (Tfl), whence ;7TN, and thence of1;', or ,?, had held, of course, all the while, a place in the Hebrew vocabulary, but to this new use it had never before been appropriated. The old conception being thus linked with the new name, Jehovah becomes henceforth a memorial name to all gen- erations, a perpetual reminder of his identity; the name of him who both essentially and morally is always what he is, distinguishable from whomsoever else might be called El, and to attribute change to whom is to deny his being. So the Hebrews' God becomes the one change- less, continuing God, and Jehovah is his distinguishing name; and into the knowledge of whose exclusive oneness and true character the He- brews must be indoctrinated, not in the midst of the corruptions of Egypt, nor in the midst of the polytheism of Canaan, but in the long, hard, school of the wilderness, under the immediate tuition of Jeho- vah, who instils and establishes conceptions of himself as the Mighty One, the Merciful, the Holy, the Only One, the Independent, the Un- 375</page><page sequence="8">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. changeable, the Faithful, etc. The Hebrew mind must of necessity have undergone two difficult processes, which could not have been wrought upon it elsewhere than in the isolation of the wilderness. It must be relieved of its polytheistic tendencies, and correct concep- tions of the true character of the one universal God must be introduc- ed. Hence, the new distinctive name, Jehovah, and the complex, rigid, and peculiar institutions of Moses. OLD TESTAMENT CRITICISM IN THE AMERICAN CHURCH. BY PROFESSOR GEORGE H. SCHODDE, PH. D., Columbus, Ohio. Old Testament criticism in its present phase has a somewhat peculiar history in the American church. What seemed but a short time ago as a cloud the size of a man's hand in the far distance, has in a remark- ably short period increased and covered the theological heavens; in which aspect some, pessimistically inclined, see only the threatening blackness and thickness, while others know that behind these clouds is the shining sun. Without exaggeration it can be fairly said that no purely theological question has for many decades, if ever, succeeded in attracting such general attention and in drawing forth such wide- spread sympathy and antipathy in so many circles as the pentateuchal problem has done. It has become a "burning question" in the study of the professor, in the lecture room of the theological seminaries, and in the pages of scientific journals. It at once sprang into promin- ence also in the editorial and literary columns of the religious period- ical press, and even found its way into the leading literary and political papers. In short, its agitation showed that it was decidedly a popular question, on which the general reader, and not only the student and specialist, wished to be informed. Even in Germany, the land of critics and of criticism, no problems of Biblical science, not even the agitation attending the publication of Strauss' popular " Life of Christ," provok- ed such a general and animated discussion as have the claims of ad- vanced criticism in the American church. It is true that this discussion has been on both sides more dogmatical than critical, but this fact has rather added to the interest taken in the problem than detracted from it. And peculiar, too, has been the origin and source of this agitation. Only a few years have passed since the appearance of such articles as "Bible," and "Deuteronomy" in the ninth edition of the Encyclopae- dia Britannica, from the pen of Professor W. Robertson Smith furnished 376</page></plain_text>
