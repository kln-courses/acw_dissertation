<plain_text><page sequence="1">84 The Journal of Haitian Studies, Vol. 13 No. 1 © 2007 Murphy Pizza University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror: A Comparison of Women's Theologies in Vodou and Neopaganism In the chapter titled "Ezili" from her groundbreaking book, Mama Lola, Karen McCarthy Brown describes the triplicate nature of the Lwa of femininity par excellence in Haitian Vodou, Ezili. Interweaving her complex interpretations of the lore of the spirit with descriptions of phases of the life of her informant and teacher, Alourdes, the author reveals how the realities of the lives of Haitian women are acknowledged and reflected by the many facets of Ezili far more thoroughly than typical mythic archetypal analysis does. McCarthy Brown describes the three Ezilis as "both mirrors and maps," and discusses how each spirit is simultaneously a reflection of Vodou practitioners' lives and an example to follow. The longest entry in the chapter- and the most meaningful to McCarthy Brown's informant- is Ezili Danto, a Petwo spirit called "mother" by the Haitian women in the text. She is typically syncretized with the image of Our Lady of Czestachowa, a black Madonna robed in red and blue, the colors of Haiti. Our Lady of Czestachowa bears scars on her cheek, reflecting wounds Danto received while helping to lead the Haitian Revolution. Reflecting the complexity of the Haitian Independence narrative, Danto was purportedly subjected to having her tongue cut out by the very people she liberated. Manbos and houngans who are possessed by Danto consequently mumble incoherently, yet her message to the faithful is understood. Fierce, angry, heroic- especially with regard to her children- Danto was described by Alourdes as "black, black, black." She takes many lovers and marries no one, has many children, and is, interestingly, also a patroness of lesbians. Ezili Danto represents the constant struggle and the harshness that make up the lives of poor Haitian women, but also symbolizes their religious power in the context of Vodou cosmology (McCarthy Brown 2001). Equally as powerful to Vodou practitioners is the "sister" spirit of Danto, Ezili Freda. Imaged as Maria Dolorosa del Monte Calvario, a childless Virgin Mary dripping with jewelry, Ezili Freda is the version of the Lwa that popular</page><page sequence="2">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 85 literature on Vodou has presented: the ruler of love, beauty, sex, flirtation. She is the unattainable ideal for women and the ultimate object of desire for men. According to McCarthy Brown, she is also a white woman, and that attribute alone is heavily symbolic. In Haiti, less than ten percent of citizens are light-skinned; that same ten percent make up the social ascendancy and possess nearly all of the island nation's wealth. Consequently, Freda also represents social unattainability, dependence, and every woman's fantasy of life in a perfect house, with adoring husband, and no need to work (McCarthy Brown: 2001). According to some stories, Freda has children, but in her desire to be eternally perceived as young and desirable, shoves them away to be raised by her black sister, Danto (McCarthy Brown 2001). Freda, as a result, is all the things about uppity high-class women that are funny and pathetic- forever insecure, obsessed with appearance, and all too eager to shove responsibilities off on lower-class help. These two seemingly polar representations of womanhood, and the conflict between them, slip from simple symbols to recognizable patterns negotiated in the lives of the Haitian women that McCarthy Brown documents. They are also mediated by the third, and most enigmatic, version of Ezili: La Sirène. Compared to the archetypal-yet-earthbound Ezilis- Danto and Freda- who reflect the Haitian woman's social experience, La Sirène is supernatural, transcendent, and symbolically evocative of the inner experience of women practitioners. McCarthy Brown argues that perhaps the inspiration for her mermaid-like form came from the prow maidens or decorations on slave ships; La Sirène represents primordial womanness, ancestors and roots in Africa, and the mother who, during the Middle Passage, both protected and received into her depths the enslaved Africans who either survived or perished during the transit, respectively. La Sirène is also the women's initiator into the Vodou mysteries; when the formal initiation into priesthood is beyond one's financial means, women frequently relate the story of being kidnapped into the sea and taught the Mysteries by La Sirène, but retaining no strong memory of having been missing until many years later. Lore has it that one who naturally possesses healing talent and favor with the spirits is an initiate of La Sirène, and is noted by having straighter hair and lighter skin than she possessed before. The paradoxes of women's stereotyping, as well as racial and class-based stereotyping, are mitigated with La Sirène; she is both white and black, both woman and sea creature, simultaneously homeland, ancestral land, and the ocean. She is the fundamental root of women's power that is accessible when social power is not; she is also the tie to African ancestors and story of the middle passage itself (McCarthy Brown: 2001). The three aspects of Ezili- La Sirène, Ezili Danto, and Ezili Freda- are not just Primordial</page><page sequence="3">86 Murphy Pizza Womanhood, Ferocious Warriorship, and Fickle Flirtatiousness, respectively. The very fact that these Ezilis are at once separate from each other, related, and one and the same gives acknowledgment to the problematic overlaps and paradoxes inherent in women's experiences and their sense of self. Social roles, sexuality, the body, the politics of skin color and class, relationships with men, women, and children- all of these issues and their nuances are acknowledged, but not judged good or evil, and reflected in the energetic anthropomorphism of the spirit Ezili (McCarthy Brown 2001). The similarities and differences of Vodou's envisioning of the divine feminine with the concepts of the Triple Goddess in Wiccan and Neopagan communities are striking. It would be tempting to interpret Ezili as yet another version of the Maiden-Mother-Crone archetype venerated by Neopagans as the life-cycle metaphor and as the divinity inherent in all of nature, including women's bodies and experiences, still ignored or rejected by dominant Western religions. But while the Triple Goddess attempts to provide a universal divine template onto which Witches and Neopagan women fix their experience, the focus on the need for the Goddess to be universally applicable frequently leaves the variations of women's lives and meaning-making struggles unacknowledged. Often, Neopagan women will select specific goddesses from ancient pantheons or esoteric branches of other religions to fill in the interpretive gaps; while the deity may be more personally specific, the process of choosing a goddess who more directly reflects a devotee's life throws into sharp relief the complications involved in Neopagan women's attempts to have their experiences acknowledged in a Goddess form that rejects specificity (Eller 2000; Griffin 2000). The triple Ezili, on the other hand, is visceral in her directness, both in personal terms and cultural ones. The warrior-mother Ezili Danto, for instance, is simultaneously a leader in the Haitian Revolution and rendered silent by her own people, still bearing the wounds. She is everyone's mother and no one's wife. She is a fighter and a healer. She is at once nemesis, sister, and inherent part of the desirable and beautiful Ezili Freda. And, according to McCarthy Brown's analysis, women possessed by Ezili Danto experience her righteous anger so completely that they have been known to vomit blood in ceremony (McCarthy Brown 2001). The power of Ezili, in all of her manifestations, to women practitioners of Vodou is undeniable; she does not simply reflect Haitian women to themselves- she inhabits them, both intensely during possession, and more subtly in the course of living everyday life (Deren 1953; McCarthy Brown 2001). Both Alourdes's descriptions and McCarthy Brown's analysis give the Ezilis such a powerful presence that they practically leap off the page when one reads about them. Ezili and her Brazilian/Cuban counterpart,</page><page sequence="4">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 87 Oshun, have made their way into the literature of the Neopagan Goddess Movement, once again as symbols of divine femininity and as "evidence" for a worldwide, cross-cultural veneration of goddesses and female spirits. In these cases, rather than presenting their aliveness as McCarthy Brown has done- Vodou is a vibrant, living tradition, after all, while many of the European goddesses are salvaged from dead religions- the Ezilis become just Ezili with a list of correspondences and attributes useful for petitionary spellwork and as tips for shrine decoration. Moreover, Ezili's inherent Haitian-ness vanishes in these more popular texts, and she is frequently discussed as a deity who is African, but discussions of her roots among the Fon of Dahomey (Benin) do not emerge. The lack of information about Ezili's origins could be due to a lack of research on the part of popular authors; it could also be caused by genuine confusion about what kind of spiritual stake non-Haitian or even non-African American women would have in a deity as complex as the Triple Ezili. The Goddess Movement specifically has its focus on universal female divinity, careful to respect cultural boundaries. (Wicca and other Neopagan groups that venerate the Goddess in some manner are often content to be Eurocentric.) While genuinely sincere goddess- worshipers embrace the idea of having multicultural representations of their divine concepts and experiences to draw from- an end to ethnic and racial conflict is one of the desired aspirations of the Goddess Movement- there is a confusion and incompleteness about their appropriation. The images and their archetypal patterns are appealing, but the specificity of the Ezilis with regard to Haiti's legacy and their fluidity and adaptations to Haitian political/social realities as described in Mama Lola almost never appear in Neopagan Goddess literature. Neopaganism, and the Goddess Movement specifically, in the interest of learning from and accepting divine forms of many cultures, gives a nod to the deities of Vodou and its sister religions (Santería, Candomblé, etc.), but their understanding of Lwa like Ezili is frequently out of context and often superficial. Many writings on Ezili or Oshun stop at casting her archetypally as a goddess of love and sexuality, an African Aphrodite (Eller: 2000). One never encounters Ezili in these sources as the fiercely protective Danto; the same sources seem unable or unwilling to contend with the privileged, Europeanized Ezili Freda, if they know of that aspect at all- Reflecting the discomfort with social privilege (despite the overwhelming whiteness of Neopaganism, adherents are genuinely interested in learning from other cultures) and a sincere desire to respect and honor divinity in any form it takes, many Neopagans find themselves in a quandary. They wish to adopt a deity form that they feel compelled to honor and worship, but do not wish to appropriate or disrespect the traditions of cultures not</page><page sequence="5">88 Murphy Pizza their own. Hence, even well-meaning adoptions of Ezili or Damballah in Neopagan circles result in these Lwa being drained of their cultural and personal specificity (Pike 2000). Some scholars rather reductively interpret this phenomenon as an essentially cosmologically expressed "white guilt" (Eller 2000). However, looking at this pattern of conceptions of divinity- gods, goddesses, spirits, or otherwise- in the Neopagan communities points to the possibility that this runs deeper than simple atonement. Like the Triple Goddess mentioned earlier, many conceptions of the divine in Neopaganism are stripped down to their essentials, regardless of their culture of origin. The Norse Loki is reduced to a trickster; the Greek Aphrodite is a sexy babe; Mother Earth is simply a nurturing mother. In ritual, Neopagan adherents frequently perform or represent divine forces. However, in observing fieldwork there have been no instances of intense trance or possession of a person by these forces; the closest observed is a light trance technique frequently called "aspecting," but that typically translates into not much beyond heavy acting. In stark contrast to Vodou practitioners, many Neopagans are still not inhabited by their gods or their Goddess. For many Neopagan women, their bodies are a divine map, but not yet a divine vehicle (Griffin 2000). This dramatic difference in the conceptions and experiences of the divine feminine in Vodou and Neopagan traditions has its roots in differences in acculturation, philosophy, and theologies between African and Western cultures, respectively. By exploring the contrasts in the concept of self, concepts of the divine, and the concept of the female body in theological terms, some light can be shed on why physicality and religious ecstasy are the hallmarks of Vodou, and on why those elements still seem out of reach for many Neopagans despite their longing for these hallmarks. Self in Relation to the Universe: Divine Mirrors Vodou rituals are always done counterclockwise; since the heavens are always moving in a clockwise motion, practitioners honor the universe as the Divine Cosmic Mirror by reflecting the patterns of the cosmos (McCarthy Brown: 2001; Deren: 1953; Mena: 1998). It is not so surprising, then, that the lives of Vodou practitioners are reflected back to them, good and bad equally, in the personified forms of the Lwa. Conversely, Wiccan and Neopagan rituals typically begin and end moving clockwise. Since the Earth and the Cosmos are interpreted as containing eminent wisdom, rather than reflecting it, Neopagan ritual strives to emulate and attain this eminent wisdom as its own (Pike 2000; Adler 1996). In this way, a more real and truthful relationship</page><page sequence="6">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 89 with the divine is sought, unmediated by any clerical role. In some cases, Neopagans design rituals (ritual creation and composition is the preeminent Neopagan art form) to honor and contact specific deities or specific cultural pantheons. This very broad comparison highlights one of the major differences between Vodou and Neopagan Wicca: how the self is conceived in relation to divine truth. Both traditions embrace an eminent, in-the-world spirituality; however, people's relationship to that spirituality varies between the two traditions. Vodou, influenced by an African philosophical ethic, takes as a given an individual's interconnectedness with the society and the Cosmos, and the rituals celebrate and utilize this understanding (Carter 1962; Ray 1976). Wicca and subsequent forms of Neopaganism, simultaneously influenced by and in conflict with Western philosophical traditions, have an intellectual understanding of one's connectedness to the world, but acquiring this physical or spiritual understanding is often a struggle, and an ideal to be attained. Despite the tough spiritual work done to overcome the Western legacy and its insistence on human separation from the world, many Witches and Neopagans still habitually speak of one's place in the world in dualistic terms. Personally and ritually crossing this barrier between self and divine via magical working is what gives Neopaganism its energy and subversiveness, but the results are not always in the form of permanent perception change, and most Neopagans acknowledge this (Pike 2000). Like Vodou, Neopaganism does utilize the metaphor of the cosmic mirror to contextualize one's existence in the Cosmos- the Hermetic dictum "as above, so below" is frequently cited- but the divine reflections presented to many Neopagans are personae to become or to discover in oneself rather than personae who reflect just who and what they are. Neopagan deities rarely have "warts," so to speak; even the most wicked tricksters or most bloodthirsty warriors are interpreted as possessing powerful or helpful aspects that adherents work to adopt for themselves. With regard to women's experiences and the cosmic mirror, the issues of perception and reflections are thrown into sharper relief. In Vodou, its African antecedent, and its sister religions, the idea and the experience of the divine feminine are never in question. (Not surprisingly, this is one of the reasons that Christian colonists and slave traders from the West found African traditions "inferior" or "savage.") Manbos and other women Vodou practitioners are not engaged in the process of fighting to reclaim the notion of female divinity, nor is it questioned by male practitioners. As a result, space for both personal and cultural expressions of spirit- thousands of Lwa- is there, and many of the spirits manifest in ritual and possess the bodies, both male and female, of the practitioners. The rule of the mirror is</page><page sequence="7">90 Murphy Pizza at work: if it exists in the world, it must exist in the Cosmos- no negotiations, no question (McCarthy Brown 2001; Michel 2001). While not nearly the battleground that dominant Western religious traditions have become when presented with a "feminine face of God," Wicca and Neopaganism generally are still in the process of conceiving the Goddess, both cosmically and personally. Still facing the stigma of being imagined as "satanic" at worst or just plain kooky at best by the dominant culture, Neopagans' insistence on, and preference for, the Goddess is still considered a radical act, and in many ways it is still a tenuous process. Having only fifty or so years behind them, Neopaganism's cosmic conceptions are still very much the product of radical creativity rather than long-standing tradition (Griffin 2000; Pike 2000). To many Neopagan women, the Goddess is empowering and liberating, but only after a struggle and the spiritual wounding that results from overthrowing patriarchal paradigms. In the process of shaking off male-dominated perception, the image reflected back at Neopagan women has often had a "funhouse mirror" quality to it- one sees, but not clearly, and often the interpretation of the image gets in the way of the seeing. Sometimes one sees what one wants to see- or won't see what one hates to see- rather than seeing clearly. This is not the fault of Western Pagan women, nor is this a simplistic argument for the inherent "authenticity" of African traditions. The struggles are different, and rooted in different experiences. Even the most Westernized version of the spiritual experience of African-American women- black womanist theology- argues from a fundamental stance that the experiences of black and white women in the West are intrinsically different (Burrows 1999; Mattis 2002). In fact, it is generally agreed upon by womanist theologians that one cannot be white and womanist, so rooted is African-American women's sense of divine relationship based on experience. While Vodou is not explicitly "womanist," it is deeply tied to Haitian and Haitian-American history and experience: long, old, and- though syncretized- largely unbroken. There is a source that can be found when one wants to fully understand the Lwa Ezili. Neopaganism, the Goddess Movement, and Wicca are admittedly starting from scratch and emerging from a marginal group- women- who are taught to doubt their own experiences or whose experiences have been blotted from Western religious and philosophical history. White feminist theologians- after being forced to admit that they simply cannot speak for a universal female religious experience- frequently are arguing for their place in both the practices and philosophies of traditional religions that refuse to see them. This legacy still bleeds into Neopagan discourse, despite Pagans' conscious fight against it.</page><page sequence="8">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 9 1 As a remedy, the theologian Luce Irigaray suggests the idea of a mirror as metaphor for women's religious experience: woman-as-mirror. But rather than women being the passive flat mirror existing as a reflection for patriarchal values, she suggests they are a speculum mundi , a "mirror of the world," a curved mirror that not only reflects the Cosmos, but allows at some point for the mirror to be self-reflective (Sheffield 2002; Priest 2003). It is precisely this relationship of woman-as-world-as-divine for which Witches and Neopagan women are striving. Through the complete incorporation of Ezili into the lives and physicality of women Vodou practitioners as well as her presence in the cosmic whole, it appears that Vodou accomplished this centuries ago by seeing rather than striving. Woman's Holy Body: Divine Symbol and Incarnation The altars and shrines of Neopagan Witches and Goddess spiritualists are frequently centered around or, in some cases, filled with what is interpreted as the divine female body. Prehistoric images emphasizing female anatomy are often problematically regarded as goddess images and placed in Neopagan sacred spaces. Alongside images of early Pagan goddesses- Egyptian, Greek, Roman, etc.- and reinterpreted Virgin Marys and Black Madonnas, these images are utilized as polyvalent symbols, simultaneously expressing forces of nature, the earth, and the female body as divine. Women reclaiming the integrity of their bodies from centuries of devaluation by established male-dominated religious traditions is another hallmark of Neopagan religious experience. Re-making sacred the passages, functions, and appearance of the body and sexuality is another pioneering aspect of Neopaganism (Pike 2000; Eller 2000; Griffin 2000; Rountree 2002). This contrasts strikingly with Vodou practice and philosophy. The printed reproductions of altars to female Lwa like Ezili studied for this article are filled with both iconic and non-iconic symbolism- colors, foodstuffs, flowers, candles, beads, and "borrowed" Italianate images of Marys or saints among them- but no representations of the female body as such appear. In the case of Ezili, what appears most commonly and evokes her presence instantly is her heart-shaped vévé drawn on the ground with meal or beaded into a banner. Vodou practitioners frequently speak of having visions of her- as Alourdes and her daughter did in Mama Lola- and a personification of Ezili in female form is accepted, but Ezili is not a body to be symbolized. She is a spirit who, during possession, utilizes the bodies of the ritual dancers to make herself known and experienced. The body, in Vodou, is not a reflexive symbol, but a divine conduit; hence, any symbolic physicality of the Lwa is irrelevant (Deren 1953; McCarthy Brown 2001; Michel 2001).</page><page sequence="9">92 Murphy Pizza What is also powerful to watch occur in Vodou rituals is how practitioners use their bodies in the sacred dances, and the moments of possession when practitioners release control of their bodies to the Lwa who chooses to inhabit them. The dancing is fervent in itself and the moment of possession is marked by even more intense moments of seizure-like struggle until the spirit has settled into the body. It has not escaped observation in many ethnographic films that much of the possession and trance work is done by manbos and other women; whether it happens more easily or frequently to women rather than men is difficult to determine. Nonetheless, a very different metaphysic of the body is at work in Vodou: there is no body reclamation occurring in the discourse. Vodou women do not have to fight for their right to be present in ritual or for leadership roles- the tradition requires it. There is no demand for the Lwa to be represented in female form- when personified , the gender attributions of the Lwa run the gamut. And, most dramatically, there is no need for discourse on the woman's body as symbolically holy- the body and its movements are interwoven with the Vodou religious experience. One cannot practice Vodou without engaging the body. This is why the body is a holy gift and divine vehicle in Vodou, for men and women alike (Michel 2001; McCarthy Brown 2001; Deren 1953; Mena 1998). It is also, undoubtedly, this intense physicality that frightened colonizers and missionaries when they encountered this African religious expression; believing it to be inherent to the "savageness" of African peoples, colonizers and slave owners tried on many occasions and in many locations to tame or control the physicality of Vodou and its sister religions. The unapologetic use of the body was distracting and repugnant to the Christian missionaries (Mena 1998). The irony of this position emerges when one traces the history of religious movements among European immigrants and the experience of evangelical Christian and Spiritualist movements among white Americans. Here there is a long-documented tradition of "fits," "trances," and possession episodes within these contexts, and the vast majority of experiencers of these phenomena were women. Not surprisingly, the same clerical intellectuals who considered physicality and women's bodies sinful wrote off these intense visionary experiences and trances as either proof of women's emotional frailty and weakness, or as women's aptitude for sickness and insanity (Taves 1999). Hence, the conundrum of religious experience for European-American women: feminist theological theory argues for women's dignity and epistemological reality on par with men- which often requires denying the body for the mind- yet there is an intense demand for the re- sacralizing of women's bodies which, to the philosophies inherent in Western religious traditions, somehow still means rejecting the logical capability of</page><page sequence="10">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 93 the mind for the sway of emotions or physical urges. Sadly, this dualistic tangle is still being unraveled by feminist theologians (Bednarowski 1999; Heyer-Gray 2000; Charton 2000). The literal physical expression of this conundrum is observable in Neopaganism. Traditionalist Witches, while stressing the necessity of trance and energy raising, also fundamentally stress a "dignified" approach to walking the earth. The more eclectic or "shamanistic" Neopagan forms, products of the experimentation in the 1960s in the U.S., are more actively dancing and reincorporating their sacred bodies, but many women report that working through the cultural shame inflicted on their bodies is a constant, vigilant practice (Griffin 2000; Pike 2000). The old cultural habit of needing to be intoxicated in order to let inhibitions drop enough to experience altered states is occasionally contended with in Wiccan and Neopagan contexts, as well; many Neopagan versions of recovery groups have been increasing in numbers over time (Pike 2000). It is in light of this that Neopagan women adamantly reclaim and defend the integrity and holiness of the female body, whereas Vodou women do not find reclaiming necessary. Some critics of the Goddess movement and its appropriation of female imagery have wondered if there is not some form of "divine objectification" occurring within it (Eller 2000; Sheffield 2002) and if this reclamation is nothing more than, once again, essentializing women's physical experience. The same critics, interestingly, are arguing for either a more essentialist or "inclusive" imagery (forms of nature, animals, etc.) or some form of boundaryless iconography (Eller 2000). Such arguments do no justice to the reality of the West's enculturation of the female body as shameful or filthy, the "pollution" in patriarchal religions' sacred spaces (Bednarowski 2000). They also are remiss with regard to the fact that despite Western traditions' arguments for a genderless God, the history of the image of the divine demonstrated in Scripture, literature, and artistic interpretation is of a male, white God. (It is surprising, to say the least, that critics of the Goddess Movement argue as if divine embodiment exists in a historical and cultural vacuum.) Again, acknowledging the newness of Neopaganism, it may require time and work for Neopagan and Wiccan women to shift the focus from body as symbol to body as actual meeting point with the divine, as it is in Vodou. It would require trusting their experiences enough to be divinely undignified. Cultural Divine Concepts: Appropriation, Identification, or Rejection of Cultural Identity Since it is acknowledged in women's theological discourse that one culture's religious interpretation cannot speak universally for all- that,</page><page sequence="11">94 Murphy Pizza for example, womanist theologians cannot be white- it is still puzzling that Neopaganism, Wicca, and the Goddess Movement are criticized as essentialist and appropriative when they attempt mythic universality and inclusivity of cultural traditions, and simultaneously backhandedly criticized for Eurocentricity when they choose to limit their spiritual expression to their own cultural background (Eller 2000). This "damned if you do, damned if you don't" quandary would not be a quandary at all if, in American society, one's cultural or ethnic background as well as religious affiliation were not so politically charged. When faced with as much religious plurality as exists in the U.S., many religious groups- notably dominant Christianity- demand the swearing of allegiance and drawing of boundaries by believers in order for groups to determine friend from foe, perhaps as a habit of Western thought. Consequently, religious minorities are forced to resort to similar boundary-drawing and identity politics in order to be heard. While useful in public discourse, this insidious cultural habit often leads Neopagan women to question their right to blur their religious identity, ethnic, or cultural affiliation boundaries. In a sincere attempt to reject the label white and the societal privilege that comes with it, many Witches and Goddess women attempt to reclaim religious traditions that feel more culturally specific to them (Celtic or Greek, for example), but that are historically dead and reconstituted from a modern perspective. This is a problematic process fraught with critique in Neopagan communities, but it does bring up the notion that many American Neopagans feel "rootless," or culturally and ethnically bereft, unpossessing of any legitimate ties to their culture of ancestry. As it was honestly expressed decades ago by Neopagan priestess Morning Glory Zell: We're orphans, we're bastard mongrel children in a beautiful land that isn't really ours. We're grafted and transplanted, saddled with a tremendous guilt for every- thing from strip mines and city dumps to the death of the people who lived here before... The only people who have a real tradition here are the Native American people. There is much to identify with them. But it is not our tradition. We were never chanted the chants and rocked in the cradle and told the working rhythms and rhymes. Most of us were raised in concrete and steel, totally removed from the seasons around us... Some of us are attuned to the same rhythms as indigenous people, but we have no traditions. We live in an impoverished culture. We have to create our own culture from scratch. (Adler 1996)</page><page sequence="12">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 95 Thus, the preference for "the Goddess of a Thousand Names" (Griffin 2000), a divinity that represents all but reflects no one in particular. Despite this, Neopaganism is observed to be and criticized as a white phenomenon; even though the Triple Goddess symbol is intended to encourage a "multi-cultural" identification, the makeup of Neopagan groups is still mostly, to their dismay, white people. This interpretation may then be more culturally specific than Neopagan adherents realize (Eller 2000), or- perhaps more accurately- a rootless divinity that reflects adherents' self-conscious rootlessness. By comparison, McCarthy Brown argues that Ezili is a complex reflection of women's complex lives, but the patterns of personification within Ezili are also very obviously those of a Haitian reflection of Haitian women's lives (2001). Ezili and other personifications of the Lwa are culturally specific. Nonetheless, the remarkable syncretism that makes Vodou the unique tradition that it is demonstrates that cultural specificity does not inevitably result in impermeable boundaries of religious identity. Many practitioners of Vodou- notably African-American practitioners- have no trouble participating in and blending together religious ideologies and practices; it actually is frequently interpreted as a way to make spiritual relationships stronger (Hucks 2001) rather than as diluting the perceived "purity" of one religious tradition. A question arises: is it the cultural specificity of Lwa like Ezili that allows for these sorts of blurred boundaries, the belief that "all religions have ache"? Is the experience the anchor, and the acknowledgment of women's experience the tether that explains Vodou's adaptability? Engaging McCarthy Brown's argument, can Ezili truly inhabit the lives of non-Haitian, non-African women? McCarthy Brown's own initiation into Vodou is testament to her belief that Ezili can, as does Maya Deren's account of her possession (McCarthy Brown 2001; Deren 1953). It is also conversely argued by some theologians that a lack of cultural affiliation and experience makes this impossible; the Lwa are not universal archetypes (Pike 2000). Ezili's cultural specificity has a reason for being that is intimately tied up with the history of the Haitian experience. Under the duress of slavery and colonialism, the specificity of the Lwa was a method to keep the values and the cultural truths and practices of Africa alive. Watering down the Lwa or disregarding them for the European-visualized Catholic saints would have meant Africans essentially turning their back on themselves, and rejecting who they knew they were for who they were told they were. In Vodou, African language, philosophy, metaphysics, and social structures remain intact as African. The specificity is the strategy of survival. Again, it would be easy here to fall into the trap of stating that since white American women have had nothing but social privilege, it would</page><page sequence="13">96 Murphy Pizza follow that their Goddess would be ignorantly conceived as universal, since white women cannot possibly understand the experience of other women (Lorde 1984; Eller 2000). This is an assumption-laden and unfair categorization of Neopagan women's divine relationships. While cultural survival has not been the purview of white women- therein lies the slice of privilege- the place of women, their experiences, their bodies, and their social roles have been controlled and subverted by men, who have not allowed women to join the discourse about these issues. Patriarchal culture created the "womanly ideal," enforced it on women, then rewarded them with life in a gilded cage if they obeyed dutifully. Those who did not were punished socially, economically, and physically. Hence, despite their cultural privilege, white women are left to shake the cultural legacy of being inferior, polluting, worthless, incomplete, soulless. Neopagan and Wiccan women who are fully engaged in their spirituality are not so concerned with preserving their cultural legacies. If anything, their strategy has been to try to wipe the slate clean and re-learn about themselves by remaining as open as they can to other women's experiences. When confronted with essentialism in attempts to be universal in scope, Witches and Goddess-women begin to look to their pre-Christian ethnic legacies- lore and practices- but, even then, they are extremely selective about what they wish to reclaim. In this sense- in marked contrast to Vodou women- cultural maintenance is spiritual and social suicide. Conclusion: Polished Mirrors and Permeable Boundaries Engaging in a comparative discussion such as this one frequently aids in gaining insight into two seemingly different religious traditions; the problem inherent in this process is that it becomes far too easy to slip into a dichotomous trap. African- American women and white women still appear divided by experience; Vodou and Neopaganism still appear divided by cultural boundaries. Despite a commonality of religious relationship and sacred values, the cautionary voice of Audre Lorde to the theologian Mary Daly rings in the background even at well-meaning attempts for both sides to reach across the boundary (Lorde 1984). Without engaging in dismissive and pointless dialogues about "transcending experience," how can Vodou women and Witches and Goddess women interact and share their experiences without negating their different histories and social experiences? Is it possible to acknowledge commonalities in experience- physically and religiously- as women? Can the two traditions learn from each other, or are they destined to remain separated by an impenetrable boundary of experience, forever dichotomized into the subjugated and the privileged?</page><page sequence="14">Sacred Body in a Clear Mirror 97 There can be a way to bridge the gap, if it is remembered that the reality of permeable boundaries is a common theological reality for both Vodou and Neopaganism. Once identity boundaries are set up as fences or battle lines, the discussion is over; when personal identity is recognized as the fluid phenomenon it truly is, attachments can disappear and the dialogue about women's experiences can flow. Through sustained discourse, attachments to defining experiences or categorization by patriarchal institutions can be released and real social and religious change can occur. Unquestionable personal categorization is the philosophical legacy of the West, and it is a remnant of a theological history that insists on transcending and overcoming one's station in life in order to win favor with divinity; in order to gain divine approval, one must create categories and constantly strive to attain them. Rejecting this pattern is a radical act, and one in which religious women in the West are engaging. This radica) rejection requires Neopagan women to be open to re-envisioning their identity and place in the Cosmos, unmediated by patriarchal institutions. Having the model of engaged spirituality and the inhabiting divinity present in Vodou can be a valuable new religious philosophy to embrace, without needing to appropriate the cultural specificities so necessary for practitioners of Vodou. Shameless love of self and the world is shameless love of the divine; knowing this, internalizing this, may help Neopagan women look as clearly and squarely into the cosmic mirror as their Vodou sisters do, and all will have the balance and the strength to see and know deeply what divine truth is reflected back to them.
