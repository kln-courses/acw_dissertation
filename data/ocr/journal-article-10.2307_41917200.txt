A different approach to the play is that of Ezio Rai- mondi, who in a series of essays has taken soundings of the play's striking heterogeneity of inspiration and tonal register.4 Raimondi's findings pose 2. Fido, pp. 107-108. For the convenience of the reader, Marvin T. Herrick's synopsis of the play follows: Callimaco, a young Florentine who has been living in Paris for some years, has returned to his native city to see for himself a celebrated beauty, Madonna Lucrezia, wife of Messer Nicia Calfucci. The young woman has proved to be even more beautiful than reported, and he has fallen desperately in love with her. But what can he do? Lucrezia is as chaste as she is beautiful. Callimaco, who is no callow youth, perceives three weaknesses in the defense: the simplicity of the husband Nicia, the desire of the couple to have children, and the easygoing mother of the wife. Callimaco has reasoned soundly, and his campaign is successful, but not until he has engaged the help of the parasite Ligurio, who in turn has to call on a friar to win over the two women. It is Ligurio who devises the fraud that insures success: Callimaco poses as a learned physician from Paris who concocts a draught of mandragola guaranteed to make any woman conceive. There are complications, however, for it seems that the first man to cohabit with a patient who had drunk this potion will die within a week. Therefore it is necessary to kidnap some homeless young man to serve as the agent. This waif, of course, is Callimaco disguised as a strolling musician. Owing to the ready co-operation of the husband and mother-in-law, the arguments of the friar, and the expert timing of the parasite, everything runs like clockwork; the young man wins a beautiful mistress, the husband and his mother-in-law rejoice in the prospect of an heir, the parasite is sure of three meals a day for some time to come, and the father confessor is richer by 300 ducats [pp. 80-81}. 3.

Once we have fully weighed both the play's levity and its gravity, we must come to terms with the undertone of pessimism and bitterness that many critics claim to detect in the apparently jocular events. The opinion of Nino Borsellino might be considered representative:6 The world of Mandragola is fervently anarchic, deprived of ideals, where the natural order of the instincts may be restored only through moral disorder. Machiavelli acknowledges this world with that sharp and lucid realism that does not conceal its bitterness: as if the "odd and spiteful bauble" of the comedy permitted him to relieve the oppressive malignity of fate [my translation]. will return to refertilize Florence, represented by Lucrezia, hitherto in the grasp of Nicia, who stands for political impotence. Ligurio might be Machiavelli himself. For Parronchi, the alignment of characters and historical personages is more exact: because, in his view, the first performance of Mandragola took place in September of 1518 as part of the celebrations commemorating the marriage of Lorenzo de Pierfrancesco de Medici to Mar- guerite de la Tour Angoulême, Callimaco must be Lorenzo returning "victorious" from France; Nicia is the ineffectual Piero Soderini, gonfaloniere for life of the Florentine republic (and whose wife was indeed sterile). Roberto Ridolfi, in his Life of Niccolò Machiavelli , 2d ed., trans. Cecil Grayson (Chicago, 1963), accepts the identification of Nicia with Soderini. 5. In Commedie del Cinquecento, ed.

MARTINEZ With the intention of shedding some additional light on the problems raised by Machiavelli 's play, I am proposing a detailed reconsideration of the textual relationship between Mandragola and Livy's account of Lucre- tia's suicide {ab urbe condita , 1.57-59). Although the irony implicit in naming the (finally) pliable Florentine Lucrezia with the name of a Roman exemplar of chastity has been remarked, it has not served as a primary datum that might lead to a systematic view of the play.7 Moreover, the consideration of Livy's text in conjunction with Machiavelli^ addresses the principal critical problems outlined above; for the political result of the suicide in Livy's history plants for the critic the question of the political domain of Machiavelli^ own text, while the somber events of Lucretia's death extend a dark background for the ribaldry and humor of Machiavelli 's play. Let me first consider a few methodological questions. Though topical allegories such as those of Sumberg and Parronchi have been attacked as unconvincing, it cannot be doubted that Mandragola invites some form of programmatic decoding. Felix Gilbert has defined Machiavelli 's own brand of allegory as the discovery of general rules of political behavior in the events of classical antiquity.8 Indeed, Machiavel- li^ argument that human nature is essentially invariable, and that states follow regular cycles of development (the Polybian thesis of anakyklosis) permits the construction of a transhistorical frame of interpretation within which the events of the present may be measured against those of antiq- uity.9 The history of Rome and the history of contemporary Italy con- 7. One can do no better than quote de Sanctis: "La tragedia romana si trasforma nelle commedia fiorentina," Storia , p. 94. The idea that the play is at bottom tragic in mood is advanced by Benedetto Croce in "La commedia del rinascimento," reprinted in Poesia popolare e poesia d'arte (Bari, 1932), p. 247; the notion is developed by Russo, Machiavelli, p. 143- It has been restated recently by Ridolfi, Studi sulla commedia del Machiavelli (Pisa, 1968), pp. 65-66. Ian Donaldson's The Rapes of Lucret ia: A Myth and Its Transformations (Oxford, 1982), appeared too late for me to exploit its rich inventory of literary and artistic treatments of Lucretia in the formulation of my own arguments. Donaldson addresses many of the issues I have considered in my own approach - the relation of political and sexual tyranny (p. 8) and the symbolism of Tarquin's knife (pp. 16-17), for example - but his own views of Mandragola are disappointingly conventional. His conclusion, that Machiavelli is demythologizing Lucretia (p. 93), could not be further from my own. 8. Felix Gilbert, Machiavelli and Guicciardini (Princeton, N.J., 1965), pp. 168-169. 9.

English translations of the Discorsi are from The Prince and the Discourses, introd. Max</page><page sequence="5">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 5 stitute two discourses that can be read in terms of one another - one way of defining allegory. The evidence for such an interpretive context may be found readily in Mandragola, from the references in the author's prologue to the corruption of the present age ("che per tutto traligna dall'antica virtù ... il secolo presente") to the use of specifically Roman names (Lucrezia, Ligurio, Camillo) beyond the requirements of Plautine and Terentian example. 10 The comedy thus shares that comparative spirit that makes the juxtaposition of Roman and Italian events a reflex - indeed, a method - of the Prince and the Discourses on the First Decade of Titus Livius.11 Nor is the play's political context merely general: readers have noted that Machiavelli situates Callimaco's departure from his native city in 1494, when the first French invasions of Italy, in Callimaco's words, destroyed the province of Italy (" ruinorno quella provincia"). 12 As Luigi Russo observes, reflections on the effects of 1494 are uncharacteristic of the blandly apolitical Callimaco but typical of his author; Callimaco's Lerner (New York, 1950) (translator of the Discorsi is Christine E. Detmold). Machiavelli's examples are the Gauls against the Romans and the hosts of Charles VIII against the Italians. For the "Polybian" thesis of cyclical history, see the Discorsi, I. For Machiavelli's use of Polybius, now generally accepted, see G. Sasso, Niccolò Machiavelli, storia del suo pensiero politico (Naples, 1958), pp. 308-315 (on the anakyklosis).

MARTINEZ words in fact reiterate a phrase from the Discourses. 13 And the date does not simply dangle freely; Callimaco's opening soliloquy dates the action of the play to 1504, ten years after the first of the French invasions, es- tablishing a mensuration by decades that recurs in the play and that corresponds to Machiavelli^ division of political epochs in the allegorical Decennali, which begin in 1494. 14 In the context of Machiavelli 's use of Livy both in Mandragola and in his commentary on the first decade of Livy's history, the ten-year segments in the play are linked to Livy's division of the books of his history into pentads and decades, which reflects the Roman practice of measuring years by lustra. 15 Though not necessarily coextensive, the measurement of time and of the articulations of narrative share common principles. Finally, as stated in the author's prologo, the apparato or stage set for Mandragola represents Florence, though the illusionism of the theater will permit, another day, the repre- sentation of Rome or Pisa. 16 For Parronchi, mention of Rome and Pisa helps to corroborate his view that the play celebrated the union of Lorenzo de Medici and his French bride. 17 But whether his hypothesis is proven or falsified, it remains suggestive that Machiavelli has chosen to mention both the illustrious model and parent of Florence - Rome - and Pisa, the city that was the most recalcitrant object of Florentine imperialism and 13.

My own argument, then, goes further than that of those who admit a general relationship of Mandragola to the major political statements, but remains distinct from the approaches of topical allegorists who discern a specific, historical dramatis personae in the characters of the play. More than a play with historical overtones, Mandragola is itself a form of theorizing about, and interpreting, history and politics. Moreover, with respect to the story of Lucretia in particular, Machiavelli is in an es- tablished Florentine humanist tradition, for it has been shown that for early humanists and republicans alike, the iconography of the rape of Lucretia was associated with anti-tyrannical and pro-republican views. At the same time, the story of Lucretia appears in panels that mark the progress of scientific perspective in the scenografia of the early Renaissance, such that Machiavelli^ choice of Lucretia as part of his subject occurs in a context where a specific link between the Roman episode and the public spectacle of the commedia had already been established. Some elaboration of these points may be helpful. Already in the late trecento the rape of Lucretia was the subject of a pro-republican declamatio by Coluccio Salutati, and thus figures in the complex debate, analyzed in detail by Hans Baron, over the relative merits of tyrannies or republics that agitated humanists of the early Renaissance.20 To confirm the persistence of the Lucretia theme in the 18.

Co-</page><page sequence="8">8 RONALD L. MARTINEZ terms of the same debate, Guy Walton has shown that the Baltimore Lucretia panel, dated to 1504 or slightly after, caps a discernible tradition of representations of the rape of Lucretia and Brutus's subsequent oration over her body.21 As Walton points out, the presence in the Baltimore Lucretia of the statues of David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes make the anti- tyrannical polemic of the panel unmistakable, as these figures, once totems of Florentine resistance to Visconti tyranny, had come to signify the hostility of the Florentine republic to the continued dynastic pretensions of the Medici after their expulsion in 1494. The subject of Lucretia and Brutus (paired with the related episode of Appius and Virginia) is thus inscribed in a political iconography at the heart of Florentine civic concerns. In addition, as both Walton and Richard Krautheimer have shown, the Lucretia and Virginia panels, in their use of noble, classicizing architecture and their adoption of rigorous scientific perspective, are textbook examples of the so-called tragic scene. Krautheimer notes that the "tragic scene," whether devised for real or imaginary performances, evolves in close synchronization with the evolu- tion of scientific perspective itself; its depiction of classical temples, arches, and plazas conform to canonical distinction, descending from Vitruvius through Alberti, between the archetypal "tragic" and "comic" scenes.22 It is just such a "perspective," the famous Urbino panel, that luccio Salutati refers to his declamation on Lucretia in a letter {Epistolario di Coluccio Salutati , ed. F. Novati, v. 4, [Rome, 1905} [Fonti per la storia d'Italia, v. 18], pp. 253-254); Novati gives in his note the passage to which Salutati refers, from Lucretia's answer to her father's and husband's pleas that she not commit suicide: "Nichil muliere mobilius: egritudinem animique motus nedum mollit sed extinguit tempus. si distulero, forsan incipient michi flagitiosa piacere," etc. The passage is striking because it makes Lucretia's justification for suicide her fear of her own nature as a woman, "semper varium et mutabile." 21.

The de- scription is of a classicizing scene, with friezes and reliefs depicting Ro- man heroes, including the Horatii.24 In the context of Machiavelli^ own literary practice and political interests, it is hardly speculative to assert that a conspicuously classicizing backdrop for the bourgeois comedy of Mandragola would provide an ironic visual "perspective" on the action of the play just as the evocation of Roman Lucretia in the name of Nicia's wife Lucrezia provides verbal irony. An idealized antiquity represented both by allusion to Livy and the visual allusions of architecture frames the action of Mandragola and imposes a perspective from which the audience views and judges the events of the plot. My exposition of Lucrezia's fall will be in three parts, with a prologue. After consideration of some general aspects of Machiavelli^ use of Livy's text, the first part will consist of a description of the principal parallels between Livy's history and Mandragola. A calculation of the differences between the Roman and Florentine Lucretias yields an inventory of the differences for Machiavelli between the heroic civic virtue of the Romans and the corruption of the civic body in early cinquecento Florence. The second part of the study examines the function of ritual action in the two texts. In Livy's narrative, the episode of Lucretia and Brutus functions as an etiological fable: Lucretia's suicide makes her the sacrificial victim, the pharmakos whose destruction is instrumental in precipitating the expul- sion of the tyrants and establishing the Roman republic. As such, Lucre- tia's tragedy is one of a series of episodes in the first decade that exemplify Aristotle's view in the Politics that offenses to women may serve as 23. Parronchi, pp. 54-56. 24.

MARTINEZ catalysts precipitating revolutions in the state.26 Machiavelli's interest in Lucretia's story - as in the first decade of Livy in general - springs largely from his concern for the problems of political innovation, whether during the original foundation of a city or as a part of constitutional reform or violent revolution. Thus Mandragola, too, as some readers have observed, is itself an etiology of a new community, albeit one founded not on heroic sacrifice but on the rational calculation of private advantage, on acquisitiveness or guadagno. Third and finally - in the wake of studies showing how the lore of the mandrake root penetrates the language and action of the play - I turn to a discussion of the potent, ambiguous medicine mandragola from the perspective of Lucretia herself as the Phar- makon that purges Rome from the disease of tyranny.26 The ambiguous function of mandragola is the play's principal link to the sacrificial eco- nomy operating in Livy's account of Lucretia's suicide and its aftermath; and it is only after an elucidation of the full semantic domain of man- dragola in the play that we can begin to unravel the play's teasing final ironies - foremost of which is the magnificent rejuvenescence of Lucrezia herself. Because Lucrezia is the cynosure, the uniquely virtuous element in the generally corrupt world of the play, both her submission and her final transformation are central to our understanding of the play's meaning. The specific parallels between Livy's text and Machiavelli's play are framed by Machiavelli's use of several important Livian themes in Man- dragola. First, Machiavelli's notorious remarks in the verse prologue, referring to the corruption of the present age, repeat the fundamental premise of Livy's vast history, which would, in the historian's words, trace the progress of our moral decline . . . the sinking of the foundation of morality as the old teaching was allowed to lapse, then the rapidly increasing disintegration, then the final collapse of the whole edifice, and the dark dawning of our modern day when we can neither endure our vices nor face the remedies needed to cure them. The study of history is the best medicine for a sick mind; for in history you have a record of the infinite variety of human experience plainly set 26.

MARTINEZ through the night is made explicit in Ovid's version of the Lucretia- Brutus story in the Fasti , which follows Livy closely.32 Whichever the textual stimulus for Machiavelli, in Mandragola the play's observation of the unity of time is ostentatiously proclaimed by the corrupt priest Timoteo at the beginning of the fifth act.33 In the context of Livy's theatrical treatment of the Lucretia story, Machiavelli 's religious observ- ance of the unity of time is both vestige and elaboration of the dramatic tendencies in the historical text. Finally, the Livian account of Sextus's violence against Lucretia is framed in terms of his father Tarquinius Superbus's siege of Rutulian Ardea; it is because the siege is stalled that Sextus and the other officers, including Collatinus, fall to boasting of their wives' virtue, that "mu- liebris certamen" that leads directly to Sextus's fatal infatuation with Lucretia.34 The original context of the siege continues as metaphor through Sextus's attack and defeat of Lucretia's virtue, justifying Livy's reference to her loss of chastity with the formulaic term for the reduction of a city or fortress: "expugnatum decus."35 Livy's metaphor is hardly lost on Machiavelli the student of military strategy and the psychologist of human competition, and thus the action of Mandragola is more than once conceived in the terms of a siege operation: the protagonists Callimaco and Nicia bear the names of generals, one imaginary, one real; and the terminology of assault and resistance appears in Callimaco's calculation of Lucrezia's virtuous opposition to his desire ("mi fa la guerra la natura di lei 32.

Livy also establishes a relation between the initial attempt of Tarquin's forces to seize Ardea by storm - "temptata res est, si primo Ímpetu capi Ardea posset" (1.57.3) - and Sextus's own capture by the desire to rape Lucretia; "Ibi Sex.

I.i. , p. 62). 36 In the play's penultimate operation, the metaphor of siege is made comically explicit as Callimaco, disguised as the surrogate garzonaccio, is caught in the grip of a two-horned phalanx rallied to the cry of "San Cucù" - Saint Cuckoo. The disguised Callimaco, inserted into Lucrezia's bedroom, might be viewed as a sapper, a mine designed to "blow up" Lucrezia, the object of the play-as-siege.37 Machiavelli^ borrowings from Livy the moralist, Livy the dramaturge, and Livy the poet and mythographer - drawing parallels between the chastity of a Roman matron and the integrity of the city - would give Mandragola a Livian cast even in the absence of more specific parallels with Livy's history. But specific parallels there are. Those that I will discuss immediately following are, with one major exception, known, though their implications for the interpretation of Machiavelli^ text have re- mained largely unexplored. They are drawn from crucial junctures in Livy's episode and play correspondingly important roles in Machiavelli^ comedy. I The first major parallel serves to link Sextus Tarquinius's mimetic desire for Roman Lucretia with Callimaco's for Lucrezia. The terminology of René Girard is strikingly appropriate to the triangle of Collatinus, Sextus, and Lucretia as Livy presents it.38 Sextus conceives his desire for Lucretia because of her husband's ostentatious demonstration of her super- ior beauty and virtue. Because he desires to be the victor in the competi- 36. Callimaco's terms here for Lucrezia's chaste natura echo Machiavelli^ twenty-fifth chapter of the Principe : "Io iudico bene questo, che sia meglio essere impetuoso che respettivo, perché la Fortuna è donna, et è necessario volendola tenere sotto, batterla e urtarla ..." 37. The metaphor of Lucretia's virtue as a citadel is worked exhaustively in Shakespeare's Rape of Lucrece, w. 221, 441, 465, 485-487, 723, 1172-1173. 38. For the mechanisms of mimetic desire and its role in ordering rivalry, cf. René Girard, Violence and the Sacred , trans. Patrick Gregory (Baltimore and London, 1975), esp. pp. 145, 169, 174-175. Girard gives a succinct definition on p. 145: "Rivalry does not arise because of the fortuitous convergence of two desires on a single object; rather, the subject desires the object because the rival desires it. In desiring an object the rival alerts the subject to the desirability of the object."</page><page sequence="14">14 RONALD L. MARTINEZ tion to decide whose is the most exemplary wife, Collati nus excites a rivalry that is only satisfied with Sextus's triumph over Collatinus's dear- est possession, his wife: Collatinus, pleased with his success, invited his friends to sup with him. It was at that fatal supper that Lucretia's beauty, and proven chastity, kindled in Sextus Tarquinius the flame of lust, and determined him to debauch her. Thus Sextus desires Lucretia because she is chaste, because she belongs to another. And not merely any other. For Collatinus and Sextus are rela- tives; their rivalry echoes the archetypal fraternal rivalry stretching back in Roman history to the twins Romulus and Remus.39 The web of con- sanguineous rivalry extends even to Brutus, himself related to both Col- latinus and Sextus, though Brutus's response to Lucretia, though passion- ate, is more filial in its sexuality. In Mandragola , Callimaco's desire for Lucrezia is instigated by the praises of another as well. And even more indirectly: Callimaco falls in love with a verbal report of Lucrezia's beauty given by Cammillo Calfucci, a relative of Nicia, Lucrezia's husband. That Callimaco has not yet seen Lucrezia when he falls in love with her is a result of literary history, which interposes between the model of Livy's history and Mandragola the rich medieval and Boccaccian examples of desire instigated by verbal report.40 But these distinctions should not cloud the significance for Machiavelli^ play of the fact that the desire of the seducer is stimulated in a context that is, immediately, that of masculine rivalry. As Callimaco notes in his opening soliloquy, the news of Lucrezia's beauty comes to him at the 39. The genealogical relationships of the Tarquins to Collatinus and Brutus are ex- plained in detail in Roman Antiquities , vol. II, IV. 64. 1^4 and IV. 68, 1-2 (pp. 473, 481). Boccaccio, in his Commento alla divina commedia , ed. D. Guerri (Bari, 1913) I, 54, recalls his lineage: "Bruto fu per legnaggio nobile uomo di Roma, perciochè egli fu d'una famiglia chiamata i Giuni, ed il suo nome fu Caio Giunio Bruto, e la madre di lui fu la sorella di Tarquino Superbo, re de' romani." Though Boccaccio's genealogy differs from Dionysus's (in fact makes much better sense), the point is maintained that Brutus is kin to the Tarquins. 40. The vida of the troubadour Jaufré Rudel, who falls in love with the countess of Tripoli by hearing reports of her beauty and grace, is the most famous example. (Cf. J. Boutière and A. H. Schutz, Les biographies des troubadours [Paris, 1964}, pp. 16-17.) But Machiavelli's immediate examples are those of the Decameron, 1,5; IV. 4; VII. 7.</page><page sequence="15">Roman Lucret ia in Mandragola 15 instance of Fortuna, who thus disturbs an existence chiefly remarkable for its freedom from rivalries: . . .1 lived quietly pleasing everyone and taking pains to offend no one, so that I was accepted by the townspeople, by the gentlemen, by strangers, by the poor, by the rich . . . But when Fortune decided that I was having too easy a time of it, she ordered that one Cammillo Calfucci should arrive at Paris . . . (1.1.61) The excitement of sexual desire for Lucrezia deprives Callimaco of this tranquility and initiates him into the certamen , the competition of insatia- ble masculine desire, immediately provoked by the vehemence of Cal- fucci's praise, just as Collatinus's praise of Lucretia has excited Sextus:41 ... he named madonna Lucrezia, wife of messer Nicia Calfucci, whose beauty and manners he praised so lavishly as to leave all astonished, and awakening in me such a desire to behold her that without further deliberation, and setting aside any consideration of war and peace in Italy, I set on coming here . . . (1.1.61) There are close incidental parallels to Livy in the above passage: Cam- millo's excitement ("quasi che irato") recalls Collatinus's ardor in proclaiming his wife's virtue "certamine accenso";42 Callimaco's in- difference to the military situation between France and Italy echoes the abandonment of the stalled siege of Ardea by the soldiers and their trans- fer of interest to the "muliebris certamen." These minor parallels are significant especially in terms of the long-range effects of new passion on Callimaco. In a Machiavellian context, erotic passion, no less than politi- cal ambition, subjects its victim to the whims of Fortune - as Callimaco acknowledges - and plunges him into an uncertain world of risk. Though it is true that in the course of the play's action Callimaco, with consider- able help from others, reaches his goal, there is more than one hint that 41. Machiavelli offers a pessimistic theory of competition in the Discorsi, 1.37: "La cagione è, perchè la natura ha creato gli uomini in modo che possono desiderare ogni cosa e non possono conseguire ogni cosa: talché essendo sempre maggiore il desiderio che la potenza dello acquistare, ne risulta la mala contentezza de quello che si possiede, e la poca sodisfazione d'esso." 42. AUC, 1.57.7.</page><page sequence="16">16 RONALD L. MARTINEZ points to Callimaco as the plaything of Fortune. Callimaco's tedious posturing, his Petrarchan protests of suicidal despair, mark him as a victim of erotic furor, of the aegritudo amoris recognized as a disease since the time of Hippocrates.43 Moreover, if we look closely at the text, it is apparent that Ligurio's objection, early in the play, to pursuing the corruption of Lucrezia at the public baths because of the presence of other suitors permits Machiavelli a sly acknowledgment of Callimaco's personal mediocrity as well as a glance at the intrinsic instability of the enterprise on which Callimaco has embarked.44 As we shall see, these disturbing possibilities implicit in Callimaco's project are realized at the play's con- clusion. For the present, it may be recorded that the first principal parallel with Livy's episode, describing the moment of the origin of desire and thus the mainspring of the action, establishes the grounds for the ironic subversion of Callimaco's erotic triumph, even as it provides the occasion of tragedy in the Roman text. In the ferocious world of rivalry that Machiavelli envisions as the stage of all public and private ambitions, Callimaco's entry into the certamen for the favors of Lucrezia engages him in a gamble which he cannot win, for in the slippery world of Fortuna, triumph is the prologue of defeat. In Ovid's words: "Quid victor gaudes? haec te victoria perdet." By way of a corollary to the first major parallel to Livy, Machiavelli has veined his text with unmistakable allusion to the Roman historian by using the name of Cammillo Calfucci. Camillus, who saves Rome from the Gauls, is the hero of Livy's first decade if there is one; Machiavelli 43. Radcliff-Umsteaďs strongly positive view of Callimaco {The Birth of Modern Com- edy in Renaissance Italy , pp. 124-125) is, to this reader at least, exaggerated; Callimaco's behavior and his dependence on Ligurio are reminiscent of Roderigo's simpering depen- dence on Iago in Othello. 44. Act I, scene 3 (p. 66): "... e potrebbe venirvi uomo a chi madonna Lucrezia piacesse come a te, che fussi più ricco di te, che avesse più grazia di te; in modo che si porta pericolo di non durare questa fatica per altri, e che intervenga che la copia dei concorrenti la facciono più dura, o che dimesticandosi la si volga ad un altro e non a te." Callimaco's willingness to seize any expedient ("per pigliare qualche partito bestiale, crudo, nefando," 1.3 p. 67) is probably also an allusion to the resolution of Sextus - not Livy's Sextus, but Ovid's in the Fasti , 11.781 ff.: " 'exitus in dubio est, audebimus ultima!' dixit, / 'viderit! audentes sorsque deusque iuvat.'</page><page sequence="17">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 17 remembers him generously and often in the Discourses ,45 It is Camillus who spends his exile from Rome precisely at Rutulian Ardea, the city besieged by Sextus and Collatinus - providing a topographic link between the story of Lucretia and the illustrious career of the savior of Rome.46 Thus Cammillo Calfucci, Fortune's agent provocateur in Machiavelli^ play, evokes a standard of political high seriousness against which the characters of the play, and their narrower concerns, will finally be judged. To my knowledge, the second of the principal parallels I will discuss has not been noted in the literature on Machiavelli^ Mandragola , though an ancillary source in a novella of Boccaccio has long been recognized.47 The parallel is spread over two distinct episodes in the play. Preparing Callimaco for his placement inside Lucrezia's bedroom, Ligurio suggests that the lover persuade the wife to accept his suit by threatening to damage her reputation if she refuses: "dicale el bene le vuoi; e come sanza sua infamia la può essere tua amica, e con sua grande infamia tua nimica" (IV.iii.p.96). Ligurio's threat is a glancing but unmistakable echo of Livy's text, where it is Sextus's offer to destroy Lucretia's reputation that breaks her resistance to his lust: But all in vain; not even the fear of death could bend her will. "If death will not move you," Sextus cried, "dishonor shall. I will kill you first, then cut the throat of a slave and lay his naked body by your side. Will they not believe that you have been caught in adultery with a servant - and paid the price?" Even the most resolute chastity could not have stood against this dreadful threat. Lucretia yielded. Sextus enjoyed her [expugnato decore ], and rode away, proud of his suc- cess.48 45. For Camillus in the Discorsi : 1.29, where he is juxtaposed to Consalvo Ferrante, the great Spanish soldier; 11.23, where he is praised as an example of the rejection of the halfway measures in military and political decisions; II. 2, cited in the text, where his exile to Ardea is an example of Fortune's manipulation of human events; III. 23, on the reasons of Camillus's exile from Rome; III. 30, where Camillus is remembered for his effective measures in the protection of Rome, and juxtaposed to the imprudence of both Savanarola and Soderini, who did not know how to manage the envy of their rivals. 46.

MARTINEZ Sextus shatters Lucretia's resistance by making of her greatest strength, her commitment to her reputation, a fatal weakness. It is the dilemma into which Sextus's threat forces her that necessitates her subsequent suicide, which, she maintains, can alone convincingly witness her inno- cence of any complicity with Sextus. Sextus's threat is thus the precise weapon that batters down the fortress of Lucretia's chastity and prepares the tragedy that ensues. The echo of Sextus's proposal in Ligurio's coaching of Callimaco dis- appears from the report that Callimaco gives in the last act, after his success with Lucrezia. But Callimaco does relate Lucrezia's own testimony as to the accumulation of causes that forced her to yield to her lover. The passage is therefore functionally parallel to the moment where Roman Lucretia realizes that she must succumb to Sextus if she is to preserve her reputation: Given that your cleverness, the stupidity of my husband, the simple-mindedness of my mother, and the unscrupulousness of my confessor have led me to do what I should never have done on my own, I judge [ voglio iudicare } that all this results from a heavenly command that has so wished it . . . (V.iv. 109) Lucrezia's enumeration and evaluation of causes here is important for several reasons: it reiterates a pattern often used in the play (indeed a pattern favored by Machiavelli in his analytical works), from the dramatis personae in the authorial canzone ("uno amante meschino / un dottor poco astuto, / un frate mal vissuto," etc., w. 40-43, p. 57) to the rhetorical schemes adopted during the course of the play by Callimaco, Liurio, and Timoteo. Ligurio's version is the most succinct, as he argues regarding the possibility of corrupting the priest Timoteo: CALLIMACO Who will persuade the confessor? LIGURIO You, me, and money; our wickedness - and theirs. (II.vi.77) In effect, Lucrezia's list retrospectively reflects the plot of the play, which, under Ligurio's direction, has pitted the combined efforts of parasite,</page><page sequence="19">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 19 lover, husband, mother, and confessor against the resistance of Lucrezia's chastity. Significantly, however, the forces Lucrezia enumerates as acting upon her are not so much powers as defects - with the exception of astuzia , which is not Callimaco's in this case but Ligurio's. Where, in Livy's account, Lucretia is broken by the terror of infamy and Sextus's victrix libido , Florentine Lucrezia is constrained by simplicita , tristizia , and sciochezza. There is a calculated degradation in the nature of the forces that impinge on the chastity of Lucrezia, the cynosure; she succumbs not to violence but to cumulative, circumambient corruption. Lucrezia's decision to accept Callimaco's offer entails her will alone, for her body has by then been conceded to the supposed garzonaccio, the surrogate who is to absorb the toxic properties of the mandragola. The distinction of mind and body is pertinent to the third of the principal parallels, noted recently by Ezio Raimondi.49 In Livy's text, Lucretia's husband and father remind her that since she has not consented to Tar- quin's violence willingly her mind remains free of guilt. This Lucretia concedes, without however exempting herself from punishment: "ego me etsi peccare absolvo . . . supplicio non libero" (1. 57.9- 10). 50 In Man- dragola it is frate Timoteo who attempts to persuade Lucrezia that Now that the act is a sin is nonsense, because it is the will that sins and not the body. And the cause of sin lies in displeasing the husband, but you please him; in enjoying pleasure, but you are displeased. (IV.ii.89) The distinction drawn here focuses its irony on the passage discussed in the previous major parallel. Callimaco's proposal of love requires not the physical submission of Lucrezia, but the full complicity of her will. On the face of it, this consent is fully granted to the lover. Lucrezia, continu- ing her account of why she surrenders to Callimaco's offer, appears to place herself entirely in Callimaco's hands: 49. See Raimondi, Politica e Commedia , pp. 202-203. 50. Boccaccio's version of the tragedy in his De claris mulieribus emphasizes Lucretia's motive in preserving her life so as to proclaim her innocence, "Fearing that if she died there would be no one to avenge her innocence, she unwillingly gave her body to the adulterer," trans, in Guido Guarino, Concerning Famous Women (New Brunswick, N.J., 1964), p. 102.</page><page sequence="20">20 RONALD L. MARTINEZ ... I am not strong enough to refuse what heaven wishes me to accept. There- fore I take you as lord, master, guide: I wish that you be my father, my defender, and my entire good: and what my husband has wanted for a single evening, I wish him to possess forever. You will become his godfellow; you will come to church, and from there you will come to breakfast with us . . . (IV. iv. 109) Whether we choose to interpret Lucrezia's surrender to Callimaco's offer as the fabliau-inspired victory of a mal mariée , or as the index of the corrup- tion of the Florentine civic body, there can be no doubt that Lucrezia here submits to Callimaco and comes to will what he wills. But the imperious tone of the future tenses at the conclusion of the passage above also suggests that Lucrezia's will, though placed under Callimaco's rule, has taken on a very lively willfulness of its own - a crucial point to which I shall return at the conclusion of my argument. The three Livian parallels with Mandragola outlined above are central to the development of Machiavelli 's plot: one concerns the moment of Calli- maco's embarcation on the slippery paths of desire and Fortuna ; one the etiology of Lucrezia's fateful submission to her seducer; one the ironically pregnant fullness of her sudden complicity with Callimaco's desires. Taken together, these three junctures profile Machiavelli 's transformation of Livy's episode of ritual, cathartic violence into a sly and cynical fable of bourgeois accommodation and civic corruption. The defection of Florentine Lucrezia from the example of heroic resistance and self-sacrifice established by Roman Lucretia is the more striking because it had been the explicit purpose of the Roman heroine to set an example of severity and self-discipline for the benefit of future generations of free Romans: "nec ulla deinde impudica Lucretiae exemplo vivet" (1.57.10). The seduction of Florentine Lucrezia therefore marks a failure of the "antica virtù" to maintain itself in the Florence of Mandragola. With the fall of Lucrezia, cynosure of the play's intrigue and last surviving spark of ancient virtue, the corruption of the present age advertised in the play's prologue appears fully demonstrated.51 51. Consider a passage like Discorsi II, proemio, referring to the current conditions of Italy: "perchè in questi (tempi) non è cosa alcuna che gli ricomperi da ogni estrema miseria, infamia e vituperio, dove non è osservanza di religione, non di leggi, non di milizia, ma sono maculati d'ogni ragione bruttura ..."</page><page sequence="21">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 21 il Yet the most significant parallels between the text of Livy and that of Machiavelli remain to be discussed. These concern the results of Lucretia's suicide at Rome and of Lucrezia's submission at Florence. The last act of Machiavelli^ comedy is by common consent a tour de force of comic harmony; the ambitions, however questionable, of all the principal characters are stunningly reconciled. Nicia anticipates an heir; Callimaco possesses his Lucrezia, Timoteo may look forward to alms, "grascia" for good works, Sostrata will be cared for in her dotage, while Ligurio, the chief architect of the successful conspiracy, earns his pappo , his free meals at Nicia's expense. The felicitous cooperation of flagrant self-interest di- agrams a proleptic Hobbesian utopia, and few critics have resisted applauding the compelling, amoral joy that Machiavelli^ sleight-of-hand provides.52 Moreover, as Raimondi has noted, the final scene of the play is rich in references to both carnival festivity and Christian ritual, to the fulfillment of cyclical patterns of rebirth that Northrop Frye has termed the fundamental argument of comedy.53 Some form of rejuvenation is attributed to most of the characters: Nicia is to be reborn through his "figlio maschio," his male offspring ("Tu mi ricrei tutto quanto. Fia egli maschio?" III. 8. p. 86) though he starts to swell and blossom with self-regard well beforehand: "io paro maggiore, più giovane, più scarzo . . ." (IV.viii.p. 101). Callimaco, in turn, must repeatedly be pulled back from the brink of suicide by Ligurio's strat- agems, termed rimedi ("tu mi risusciti," I.iii.p.68), though such ex- pressions often go no further than the stock gestures of Latin comedy.54 More significant language is found in the play's final scene, as Timoteo observes to Sostrata that, in becoming a grandmother, she has "sprouted a 52.

MARTINEZ new shoot on the old stock" ("messo un tallo in sul vecchio," V. vi. p. 112). 55 In context, the remark works as a sly reference to the insertion of a vigorous young breeding male in the household of the sterile Nicia, a graft that promises to rejuvenate the declining house of Calfucci.56 But the one rejuvenescence that makes all the others possible is, of course, that of Lucrezia, who is marvelously refreshed, indeed trans- formed, by her night with Callimaco. "Gli è proprio, stamane, come se tu rinascessi," Nicia announces with delight, marveling at Lucrezia's vivac- ity ("tu sei molto ardita") where previous to her night with the garzonaccio she had seemed half dead, "mezza morta." Most telling of all, Nicia invokes one of the notoriously phallic totems of carnival to describe his re-energized wife: "La pare un gallo."57 In terms of the carnival humor that pervades the last act of the play, the immediate reasons for Lucrezia's revival are clear. The same materia medica that teaches Callimaco, dis- guised as a Parisian doctor, to analyze Lucrezia's segno (urine sample) as cruda for lack of proper covering ("mal coperta") - technically speaking, for lack of the proper decoction of the menses by the heat of male seed - would reveal that a night of normal, healthy intercourse has purged Lucrezia of the noxious humors accumulated due to Nicia's neglect of his marital duties.58 Lucrezia, with Callimaco's aid, has literally undergone a healthful purge - a catharsis .59 55. The expression "un bel tallo" refers to the phallus in the fifteenth century "canto carnascialesco" known as the "canzona degli ortolani." See C. S. Singleton, ed., Canti carnascialeschi del rinascimento (Bari, 1936), p. 5. 56. The idea of the rejuvenation of the house of Calfucci should be viewed against the background of Dante's remark, through Cacciaguida, that the Calfucci had become extinct by Dante's day ( Paradiso , 16. 106). An undercurrent of futility, as well as folly, veins Nicia's ambitions. 57. For the rooster as a symbol of fertility associated with carnival, see Emmanuel le Roy Ladurie, Carnival in Romans , trans.

Since the passage is central to my argument, I quote at some length: Her father and husband were overwhelmed with grief. While they stood weeping helplessly, Brutus drew the bloody knife from Lucretia's body, and holding it before him cried: "By this girl's blood - none more chaste till a tyrant wronged her - and by the gods, I swear that with sword and fire, and whatever else can lend strength to my arm, I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius the Proud, his wicked wife, and all his children, and never again will I let them or any other man be King in Rome."63 60. The carnival aspect of the play must not be underestimated. In addition to those carnival elements underlined by Raimondi (p. 215) and Toschi (pp. 12, 306-307) the Mandragola is set - if Ridolfi's deductions are correct - in late January or February, which is carnival time. In Machiavelli^ day plays like Mandragola were conventionally staged during carnival festivities, whether their subject had any explicit link with carnival or not (Machiavelli's Clizia, for example, is set during carnival: "Ed è pur carnesciale," II. 3., ed. Gaeta, p. 129). 61. Livy's description explicitly identifies the event with the pubescence, so to speak, of Rome as a political entity: "Dissipatae res nondum adultae discordia forent, quas fovit tranquilla moderatio imperii eoque nutriendo perduxit ut bonam frugem libertatis maturis iam viribus ferre possent" ( AUC , II. i. 6). 62.

Festa, [Florence, 1926]), III. 65 1-802, Petrarch relates the story of Lucretia's suicide as the occasion that sparked the expulsion of the kings ("causa novande," 1.65 1); cf. also Cicero, De finibus bonorum et malorum, 11.66: "Stuprata per vim Lucretia a regis filio testata cives se ipsa interemit.

MARTINEZ The vehemence of Brutus's oath, and the miracle of his sudden, albeit artificial, transformation ignite the others, who follow their new leader in swearing an oath; led by Brutus, they raise a tumult that frightens Tar- quín from Rome. These results have been predisposed by Lucretia herself, who before her suicide challenges the men of her household to avenge her if they are men enough, "si vos viri estis." Her challenge, and Brutus's response, have the effect of galvanizing the passive, grief-stricken men (cf. "luctu occupatis") into citizens worthy of political independence.64 Lucre- tia provides Brutus not merely with the perfect opportunity for his sudden and dramatic self-manifestation as liberator ;65 she also provides the culter, the knife symbolic of the virga of power, flowing ("manatem cruore") with her generous blood, which Brutus seizes and passes to the others, joining them in a fraternal conspiracy of liberi.66 Armed with her strength, they expunge the tyranny in retaliation for the expunction of her chastity. Lucretia's role is that of scapegoat, the pharmakos who assumes the viru- lence and opprobrium of the tyrant in her own person by literally in- corporating his seed. Killing herself, she expiates her defilement and becomes (as in the later practice of devot io ) an instrument for the renewal of Rome.67 In addition, if she is herself the sacrificial victim, her blood - whose defilement by the "regia iniuria" is punctiliously mentioned by Brutus - is a Pharmakon, a remedy both virulent with the tyrant's seed and virtuous because of Lucretia's sacrifice.68 Touching it as it flows from the 64. As Ogilvy notes (p. 228), the fact that the Romans are described in Livy's text as "opifices ac lapicidas" ( AUC , 1.59.9) means that they were like slaves. That Spurius Lucretius, Lucretia's father, and Collatinus are overcome with grief implies that they have been unmanned; the effect is made more strongly in Ovid, Fasti, 11.835-836: "ecce, super corpus communia damna gementes / obliti decoris virque paterque iacent." 65.

Ovid, Fasti, 11.839: "stillanteque tenens generoso sanguine cultrum"; Pet- rarch, Africa, III. 740-741: "Ille cruentum / Fervidus educens spumanti vulnere ferrum." 67. Ogilvy notes that the story of Lucretia is based on Greek stories including accounts of the expulsion of the Peisistratids. Recently, the function of the pharmakos in Oedipus Rex has been studied with brilliant results by J. P. Vernant, "Ambiguité e renversement; sur la structure enigmatique de "Oedipe-Roi," in Echanges et communications: Mélanges offertes à Claude Lévi-Strauss (Mouton, 1970); see also Girard, Violence, pp. 108-109. 68. Both the nourishing and medicinal or lustral aspects of Lucretia's blood (and its pollution by the seducer) are strongly implicit in the accounts; Ovid's "generoso sanguine"</page><page sequence="25">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 25 phallic culter, the conspirators, wailing with effeminate grief, regain the masculine virtù that tyranny had stripped from them. That Lucretia's power is, at the moment of her death, that of the phallus is unmistakable if Livy's passage is scrutinized.69 Subsequent versions of the story, modeled on Livy's render more nearly explicit the sense in which Lucretia, through her heroic act, becomes masculine. Thus Ovid, in the Fasti , refers to her as "matrona virilis animo," a phrase echoed by Valerius Maximus, who makes Lucretia the chief {dux) of Roman chastity and ventures that her soul, truly virile, was misplaced in a woman's body by an error of Fortune: "Dux Romanae pudicitiae Lucretia, cuius virilis animus maligno errore fortunae muliebre corpus sortitus est . . ."70 Ovid, too (though not Livy), gives to Lucretia the gesture of modesty at the moment of death attributed to the murdered Caesar, who fell so as to prevent any possibility of exposing himself.71 And Livy's own description of Lucretia's fall - "prolapsa in vulnus moribunda cecidit" - echoes the fall of male heroes on the epic battlefield.72 More significant still is the fact that Lucretia's insistence on exacting the full penalty for her minimal complicity with Sextus provides an example of that unyield- ing respect for the law that Machiavelli - among others - admired among (Fasti, 11.839) and "fořtem castumque cruorem" are expressive of the enhancement of Lucretia's virility precisely because of her rape by the virulent Sextus. The idea is taken to its extreme form in Shakespeare's Lucrece, where Lucretia's blood separates: "Some of the blood still pure and red remained / And some looked black, and that false Tarquín stained" (w. 1742-1743). For a brilliant dissection of Pharmakon as a radically ambiguous term in Plato's language, see J. Derrida, "La pharmacie de Platon," in La dissémination (Paris, 1972), pp. 69-197. 69. The spotlight on the culter as phallic is in evidence from the point where Sextus enters armed into Lucretia's room ("stricto gladio," 1.58.2; "ferrurn in manu est," 1.58.2) and continues when Lucretia draws her knife from beneath her garments ("Cultrum, quem sub veste abditum habebat ..." 1.58. 11). Again, it is in Shakespeare's Lucrece that the phallic imagery becomes pervasive; cf. w. 359, 364, 505, 1843 (364: ". . .at the mercy of his mortal sting"). 70.

MARTINEZ the Romans of the republican period.73 Lucretia's act establishes the rigor of the law as above any and all circumstantial mitigation. It is thus no accident that Brutus, who is in a sense both Lucretia's final lover and her true spiritual offspring, is remembered by Machiavelli for his willingness to sacrifice his own sons to the rigor of the law when they conspire to return kings to Rome.74 Because she establishes the primacy of law, because she reinvests Roman manhood with their lost phallic virtue, Lucretia is a true founder of the city, urbis conditrix, justly ranked in that small class of lawgivers and city-founders Machiavelli admired above all other persons.75 Contra Augustine, who chops logic in dismissing the virtue of Lucretia's act in the City of God, Lucretia's exemplary demonstra- tion of inflexible adherence to a draconian law for the sake of the future republic is not a private act of escape from shame but a public ritual, a sacrifice. Another, related dimension of Lucretia's suicide must be mentioned at this point. I suggested earlier that Sextus's threat to dishonor Lucretia's memory - and Lucretia's submission to that threat - necessitate her suicide. Her death both punishes her justifiable moment of weakness in yielding physically to Sextus at all and frees her memory from any taint of blame in so doing. As the early Christian fathers (and, much later, Boc- caccio), recall the event, Lucretia's suicide is lustral, washing her soul clean of Tarquin's lust and of any doubts regarding her own complicity.76 Because Lucrezia's resolution and courage are described by Roman writers as virile, her suicide appears as a victory not only over her shame, but over her female nature. Thus, Livy's account of Tarquin's entrance into Lucre- tia's chamber stresses her physical vulnerability before the rapist: Lucretia opened her eyes in terror; death was imminent, no help at hand.

Quo terrore cum vicisset obstinatum pudicitiam velut victrix libido . . . The subsequent heroic, virile behavior of Lucretia marks the transforma- tion that has taken place since the rape - indeed, because of the rape, for Lucretia's body transforms the virulent seed of the Tarquins into the force that restores the Romans - and the sense in which Lucretia's suicide, a typically masculine gesture in Roman culture, signifies her triumph over the feminine debility that necessitated her physical submission to Sextus. The episode of Lucretia's suicide and its effect on Lucius Brutus and Rome is often alluded to in Machiavelli^ Discourses.78 It is discussed most extensively at the beginning of the third book, where Brutus's opportun- ism in seizing the moment offered by Lucretia's suicide is singled out for special praise: . . . when on the occasion of the death of Lucretia, in the midst of the father, husband, and other relatives, he was the first to pluck the dagger from her breast and to make all present swear henceforth to suffer no king to reign in Rome. (III. 2) In the following chapter, Brutus's severity in condemning his own sons for conspiring against the republic is also praised. The discussion of Brutus's merits takes place in the context of the thesis that opens the third 77. Ovid's version links Lucretia's physical vulnerability to Sextus with psychological vulnerability stemming from fear of dishonor: "quid faciat? pugnet? vincentur femina pugnans" {Fasti, 11.801); "succubmit famae vieta puella metu" (11.810). In Discorsi, 1. 19 Machiavelli points to the need for the successive kings of Rome to return periodically to the Romulean virtue of the city's foundation in order to prevent the onset of "effeminacy": "era bene poi necessario che gli altri re ripigliassero la virtù di Romolo, altrimenti quella città sarebbe diventata effeminata." 78. See 1.3; 1.9; 1. 16; 1. 17; 1.25; 1.28; 1.58. The examples of the expulsion of Tarquín and the life of Camillus are in fact among the most frequently cited in the Discorsi.</page><page sequence="28">28 RONALD L. MARTINEZ book of the Discourses. The principle is elaborated in the medical terminol- ogy that Machiavelli uses following Livy's diagnoses in the histories:79 . . . and the means of renewing them is to bring them back to their original principles. For, as all religious republics and monarchies must have within them- selves some goodness, by means of which they obtain their first growth and reputation, and as in the process of time this goodness becomes corrupted, it will of necessity destroy the body unless something intervenes to bring it back to its normal condition. Thus, the doctors of medicine say, in speaking of the human body, that "every day some ill humors gather which must be cured." (III. 1) In the context of the pathology of the civic body as Machiavelli presents it in the third book of the Discourses, the analysis of Lucretia's suicide as a remedy, a Pharmakon that buys the health of the state and returns Rome to the pristine, virile origins of Romulus and Numa appears consistent with both the political and metaphoric dimensions of Machiavelli's thought.80 But even after putting the suicide of Lucretia in the context of the politi- cal pharmacopoeia of the Discourses, and noting the continuity of medical terminology uniting the Discourses and Mandragola, we may well ask how the episode of Lucretia as an etiology of the republic can be translated into the narrower, bourgeois world of Machiavelli's comedy. First, the function in Machiavelli's political typology of Lucretia's suicide as the opportunity for Brutus to return Rome to its principles informs Machiavelli's insertion of political details in Mandragola. As noted before, the date of action is placed in 1504, ten years after the invasion by Charles VIII that initiated the ruin of Italy but also provoked the restoration of republican rule to Florence. Thus, by the end of the date of the play's action, Florence had been a republic for a decade, exactly one 79. References to the sickness and health of the body politic are abundant in Machiavelli's text; cf. Discorsi , 1.4: "e sono in ogni republica due umori diversi"; 1.7; 1. 17: "e che quella corruzione che era in loro si fosse cominciata ad istendere per le membra, come le membra fossero state corrote era impossibile mai più riformarla"; II. 1; II. 5; 11.30; III. 49. 80.

See also Raimondi, p. 153-</page><page sequence="29">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 29 of the intervals Machiavelli, in the Discourses , recommends might separate attempts to return the state to its principles after inevitable corruption: It would be desirable therefore that not more than ten years should elapse be- tween such executions, for in the long course of time men begin to change their customs, and to transgress the laws; and unless some case occurs that recalls the punishment to their memory and revives the fear in their hearts, the delinquents will soon become so numerous that they cannot be punished without danger. (Ill- 1) Lest the common interval of ten years appear too general to establish the parallel between Mandragola and the Discourses , it may also be noted that the relation between the invasions of the French armies and the invasion of the Gauls in early Roman history (like Lucretia's suicide, the event shocked the Romans into undertaking constitutional reforms) is made explicitly by Machiavelli, again in the Discourses. In Machiavelli's own terms, then, historical Florence, ruled by the complacent Pier Soderini and the Otto di balia is, or rather might have been, ripe for a constitutional crisis that would benefit the health of the republic.81 That no such crisis is precipitated - that, in fact, the parallel of Roman and Florentine history invoked by Lucrezia's name is defective - is precisely the point: the in- trigue of Callimaco and Lucrezia occurs not in a heroic political context uniting ancient Rome and modern Florence, but rather in the in- digenously Florentine world of the Boccaccian bourgeois novella , the world of the ingenious trick, the beffa .82 As Machiavelli argues in the Discourses , if the corruption of the citizenry proceeds too far the oppor- tunity to "riprendere lo stato" and return it to its principles is irretriev- 81.

In Machiavelli's view Florence was faced with a historical obstacle to maintaining its freedoms because of its former servitude to Rome; see Discorsi, 1.49 and II. 1, for the harm to citizenship caused by servitude. 82. Machiavelli's debts to the novelle of Boccaccio are well established; for some in- ventories see Russo, La commedia , pp. 26-39, and Raimondi, pp. 180-181. For Machia- velli, Boccaccio's masterpiece suggests a world of bourgeois mercantilism which the "anti- ca virtù" of the Romans - who played off private interest against public need - cannot penetrate. The political tragedy of Renaissance Florence, incapable of regaining the virtue of a true republic, is played out in the struggle between the Livian fabula of Lucretia and the Boccaccian register of the beffa.</page><page sequence="30">30 RONALD L. MARTINEZ ably lost.83 The very transformation of literary genre from Livy's narrative tragedy to Lucretia to Machiavelli 's beffa- 'msipiïzà comedy is eloquent testimony of Machiavelli^ typology of historical cycles at work: in Man- dragola, an economy of seduction and accommodation replaces the cathar- sis of heroic violence in ancient Rome; the virtù that stood in Lucretia's suicide falls with Lucrezia's submission to the suffocating alliance of astu- zia , sciochezza, semplicità , and tristizia.84 Second, just as Lucretia's suicide and its effects stage the foundation of a new community bound by her virile blood, Ligurio's plot in the comedy binds Timoteo, Nicia, Callimaco, Sostrata - and finally Lucrezia herself - in a new community based not on the austere rigor of the law but, rather, on the programmatic corruption of the civic role of each member. Early in the play we see Ligurio the parasite, Timoteo the corruptible priest, and Callimaco, the comically ruinous lover, con- spicuously pledging their questionable faith to one another.85 The alle- giance is not merely the routine complicity of Latin comedy. In a unique moment of professed emotion, Ligurio, the social parasite, acknowledges an intimate fraternal kinship with his client, Callimaco: "il tuo sangue si affa col mio" (I.ii.p.67). The utterance has sinister portent if we compare the words of Ligurio's other chief conspirator, Timoteo, reflecting on his own seduction by the parasite: "This devil of Ligurio presented himself to me, and made me dip ( intignere ) my finger into a fault, where I've since place my arm and my whole body" (IV. vi. 99). No reader of the Latin Bible can fail to hear the priest's allusion here to the possession of Judas by the demon and to Christ's pronouncement that one who dipped his bread in the dish with him would betray him: "Qui intingit mecum manum in paropside" (Matt. 26:23). Ligurio's elegant plot to seduce Lucrezia, which depends on the corruption of each conspirator for its success, is the model of a community where the characteristic act is betrayal. The socially microcosmic nature of the community of conspirators has often been remarked; Sumberg in particular has noted the constitutive 83. Cf. Discorsi, 1.17-18, and Pocock, pp. 203-211. 84.

The behavior of the principal characters systematically displays an inventory of violations of civil and canon law and traditional piety. Nicia, the paterfamilias (!), accepts the certainty that a fellow citizen will die on his behalf, though he has qualms about the possibility of getting caught;88 he stands just at the point where the threat of punish- ment provided by the laws no longer represses criminal behavior.89 As far as Timoteo is concerned, even in Machiavelli's supposedly skeptical terms the pliable priest undermines the legitimate social authority of the 86. The idea of the play as descriptive of the establishment of a community is sug- gested as well by allusions to the epoch of the biblical patriarchs: Timoteo's reference to the daughters of Lot (III. 1 1, p. 89) and to the sterility of Rachel (who therefore requested mandrakes, cf. Gen: 30, 1-16) supplement Machiavelli's references to the antiquities of Rome. Compare for example Callimaco's mention of Nicia's desire for children (1.1, p. 63: "hanno un desiderio che muoiono") with Rachel's plea in Gen. 30:1: "Da mihi liberos, alioquin moriar." 87. V.2. The "washing" of Lucrezia and her reconsecration are usually the con- sequences of an actual parturition, not of a night of love. Nicia's anticipation of the ceremony continues the theme of Lucrezia's (and his) delivery from the toxic mandragola. 88. Cf. Nicia's extreme fear of the "Otto di balia" (II. 6 p. 77-78). In Machiavelli's terms Nicia's corruption resides not so much in his callousness as in his willingness to let another engage in a dangerous enterprise in his stead and on his behalf; cf. Pocock, p. 204, where it is pointed out that for Machiavelli the model of public irresponsibility is the hiring of mercenaries. 89. Discorsi, 1. 11-14. "Perchè dove manca il timore di Dio, conviene o che quel regno rovini o che sia sostenuto dal timore d'uno principe che sopperisca a' difetti della religione" (1.11). It is precisely such a "mancanza di divozione" that Timoteo (whose name recalls "timore di Dio) laments in the fifth act (p. 105).

MARTINEZ church - affirmed unambiguously in the first book of the Discourses - by violating the privileges of the confessional: "E si maravigliano poi se la divozione manca." Both Sostrata and Nicia cheerfully prostitute a virtuous wife in order to guarantee the legal and economic security that follows from having male heirs. The principle in the name of which the characters engage in fun- damentally antisocial acts is stridently inscribed in the cognome of Calli- maco himself: Guadagni. Machiavelli, who draws from Dante's Commedia the family name of Nicia and Cammillo Calfucci (cf. Paradiso 16. 106) has also remembered the poet's excoriation of the Florentine nouveau riebe in the Inferno : La gente nova e i subiti guadagni orgoglio e dismisura han generate Fiorenza, in te . . .90 As Machiavelli writes in the Discourses, the pursuit of private gain at the expense of public good is one of the maladies that can afflict and destroy a republic.91 So noxious is wealth to civic virtue, he argues, that it were better that the citizenry of a republic were kept poor so as to corrupt neither others nor themselves: The cause of this is manifest, for it is not individual prosperity, but the general good, that makes cities great . . . (IL2) We have argued elsewhere that it is of the greatest advantage in a republic to have laws that keep her citizens poor. (111.25) By contrast, the characters of Mandragola - Nicia, Callimaco, even Sostrata - are explicitly prosperous. It is Nicia's great private wealth, and his desire to maintain it as such, that spurs him to desire the personal inconvenience of children: 90. Note Ligurio's instruction of Callimaco at IV. 2 (p. 96): "tu te la guadagni." 91. For Machiavelli^ analysis of the effects of acquistare and guadagno on the political virtue of citizens, cf.

(1.1.63) Finally, as I have already suggested above, Machiavelli's metaphor for the health and corruption of the political bodies is a traditional one: that of the human body.92 In this respect - whatever other models he may have consulted - one principal source is Livy's history, where the preface draws on the metaphor and whose first pentad includes the most important Roman instance of the metaphor, the speech of Menenius Agrippa famil- iar to all students of Shakespeare's Coriolanus ,93 In different ways, Machiavelli's echoes Livy's poem and its metaphor of the body in the prefatory chapters to all three books of the Discourses.94 The importance of the metaphor of the body for Mandragola, whose title describes a remedy for sterility, can hardly be overstated. In addition to what is explicitly medical in the play - Callimaco's disguise as a Parisian physician and the gynecological and pharmaceutical lore that he spouts - the medical lex- icon that operates in the play is directly linked to the relationship between Roman Lucretia as pharmakos! Pharmakon for the Roman state and the rejuvenation of the characters in the comedy, especially Madonna Lucrezia herself. In Livy, the passage of the bloody knife, the virga of power, to Brutus and the other conspirators initiates the resurgence of Rome; in Mandragola, Lucrezia's restoration is attributed to the superior sexual potency ("iacitura") of Callimaco. At the same time, however, the col- lapse of ancient virtue begins with the fateful transmission of Callimaco's phallus to Lucrezia. To illuminate this important nexus linking Livy and Machiavelli's comedy, the meaning of the play's title - and thus the lore of the mandragola - must first be briefly considered. 92. For the conception of the state as a human body in antiquity and the Renaissance, see Leonard Barkan, Nature's Work of Art (New Haven, Conn., 1974), esp. pp. 97, 100, 115, 119, 151, 158-159. 93. AUC, 11.32-33. 94. Texts in note 28, above.</page><page sequence="34">34 RONALD L. MARTINEZ III The importance of traditional lore on the mandragola for the plot of Machiavelli^ play has been illuminated by several recent studies.95 In- trinsically, however, mandragola serves as the comprehensive rubric for sexual meaning in the play. As Callimaco describes it, mandragola can be made into a pozione that promotes not only fertility, but impregnation itself: "non è cosa più certa a ingravidare la donna che darli bere una pozione fatta di mandragola1 (II. vi. p. 75). Callimaco is presumably leaving out an important step when he suggests that the potion will cause preg- nancy without futher interventions of the male. But the omission is significant because it suggests a metaphorical equation between the nat- ural cause of Lucrezia's pregnancy - Callimaco's seed - and the fabulous mandragola. Consequently the numerous terms in the play that refer to the remedy - pozione , rimedio, Nicia's colloquial suzzacchera , hypocràs - may also be taken to refer to the seminal efficacy of the male.96 It is thus no accident that, given the rhizomatic analogy between the mandrake root and the male radice , the play abounds in double entendres for the phallus, woven deftly into the play's richly idiomatic texture of language such that the comedy becomes a sustained carnival song, a canto carnascialesco with all of its ingeniously veiled obscenity.97 Expressions like Nicia's "zugo a piuolo" (III. vii. p. 86), and references to the "tallo in sul vecchio" for which Sostrata hopes, to the spadaccino or bodkin worn by Nicia at the capture of the potent garzonaccio, to the bladder and bauble ( vesciche , badalucco ), to the white-headed leek (in sodomizing position, "porro di dietro") are all circumlocutions for the sex of the male. Nicia, anticipating the events to take place in his own bedroom, expresses confidence that 95. See note 26, above, for citations. 96. The analogy between the mandrake root and the phallus is suggested when Timoteo observes the removal of Callimaco from Lucrezia's room: "e' cavano fuora el prigione," where cavare (extract, dig out) recalls one of the common terms for digging up the mandrake root; cf. Raimondi, p. 257, who cites a commentary to Dioscorides (15 18): "iactantque tanto periculo effodi humana forma." 97. Machiavelli wrote several obscene carnival-songs, including "di uomini che ven- done le pine" (Gaeta, p. 337), where the pine cone is an image for the penis: "e che direte voi che dal pin cola / un licor ch'ugne poi tute quei nocchi ..." For similar examples, see also Singleton, Canti , passim.</page><page sequence="35">Roman Lucret ia in Mandragola 35 "Pasquina enterrà in Arezzo" - that is, that the phallus will enter the "dark place" (a rezzo) successfully.98 The most important reference to the male sex from the perspective of the links between Livy and Machiavelli's comedy is brilliantly indirect. It comes during the hilarious scene of Nicia's examination of the garzonaccio - Callimaco in disguise - to determine if there any signs (bolle, sores) of syphillis or other venereal disease. Nicia's role of health inspector is transparently a ruse: what he really wants to do is touch and see, "toccare e vedere," Callimaco's body and its splendid endowment. As he puts it, he wants to get to the bottom of the matter, "toccare a fondo." He goes so far as to make sure that the mystery to be consummated between Lucrezia and the garzonaccio is already well underway before he leaves the room: "e innanzi volli toccare con mano come la cosa andava" (V.ii.p. 107). Now, Nicia's expression "toccare e vedere" reflects a for- mula of Latin comedy, adopted in its turn by the novella, usually appear- ing in the mouth of a clever servant promising to show his master the facts of a given matter." But Machiavelli's little scene in the fourth act also has more proximate literary antecedents in several tales of Boccaccio and in the Calandria of Bernardo Dovizi, where touching the facts of the matter has the same meaning: the phallus is the truth, th z fondo of things. 100 For 98. "Tallo sul vecchio" as a circumlocution for the penis appears also in Singleton, Canti, p. 5. The phallic suggestiveness of the spadaccino or stocco is illuminated by Machiavelli's use of a similar double entendre in his Clizia , where Nicomacho - in bed with the servant Siro disguised as Clizia - is repeatedly poked by what Nicomacho takes to be a dagger ("mi sento stoccheggiare un fianco e darmi qua sotto el codrione cinque o sei colpi de' maladetti!" (V.3, p. 160). "Pasquina enterrà in Arezzo" (Pasquina will enter in Arezzo {the town} [in the dark place]) is for Nicia a fairly transparent circumlocution of the event that he anticipates in his bedchamber; cf. Boccaccio, Decameron , VI, introduzione , where Licisca refers to "Ser Mazza" (Sir club, staff) entering Montenero ("black mountain"). In addition to terms specific of the penis, Nicia is also fond of colloquial references to the backside, "Cacastecchi," "Cacasangue," "Scingasi!" ("stickshitter," "bloodshitter," "let him drop his pants," etc.). 99- For some examples, cf. Decameron III. 6. 19; IV. 4. 9; VII. 7. 34 - significantly, the last two tales include the love-by-report device adopted in Mandragola. 100. See Decameron , II. 3. 30; III. 10. 17-18; Bibbiena's Calandria is one of Machiavelli's richer veins of suggestion for the language of his own play (I count some 28 parallels), especially phallic imagery, which is central in the Calandria because of the hero's disguise as a woman. The play's resolution thus requires some positive identifications: "Tutto l'ho</page><page sequence="36">36 RONALD L. MARTINEZ our play, Nicia's handling of his rival is not only the grotesque nadir of his cuckoldry and a strong suggestion of why he has failed to produce chil- dren, but also a parody of the ritual transmission of phallic virtue depicted in Livy's episode of Lucretia and Brutus: in other terms, it is a translatio stultitiae rather than, as in Livy's history, a translatio legis and imperii. I will return to this point in a moment. Mandragola is not to be decoded as seminal virtue only; it is also to be interpreted as a figure for the scheme of sexual differentiation itself, for sexedness as the master segno at stake in the play. Alongside the ingenious references to the phallus there are marked references to the female sex: Nicia's exclamation ("potta di San Puccio") and the profoundly obscene reference by Timoteo to the sgocciolatura, the "draining" of the surrogate from Lucrezia's bedroom (V.i.p.105), are examples. Nicia's joke about how much the garzonaccio has enjoyed the unto (grease, chrism, oil) pro- vides an ambiguous term whose meaning ranges from sexual lubricants to the mandragola itself. There is good reason for the sexual ambivalence of terms associated with mandragola. In the traditional lore regarding the plant, the mandrake is always described as both anthropomorphic and sexed, having the shape of a human body and displaying the marks of sexual differentiation. 101 It is thus the symbol of the scheme spelled out explicitly by Callimaco disguised as physician when he explains, in simple maneggiato e tocco . . "Fulvia l'ha tocco tutto, e trovatolo femina ..." (Bernardo Dovizi da Bibbiena, Calandria , in II Teatro italiano , ed. Bonino, pp. 67, 72; see also pp. 68, 73). 101. For contemporary medical information regarding the mandrake, cf. Raimondi, pp. 257-258, where Beroaldo's commentary to Apuleius's Asinus aureus is cited: "duo sunt genera mandragorae, mas et femina." The Renaissance authorities are largely dependent on the medieval encyclopedias like those of Isidore and Bartholomaeus Anglicus (who gives generous excerpts from Dioscorides); Isidore's account is relatively complete and succinct: "Hanc poetae anthropomorphon appellant, quod habeat radičem forma hominis sim- ulantem. . .huius species duae: femina, follis lactucae similibus mala generans in sim- ilitudinem prunorum. Masculus vero, foliis betae similibus ..." ( Etymol XVII. 9. 30, PL 82.627). Reference to the power of mandrakes to cure sterility is also a feature of carnival songs, e.g., Singleton, Canti , p. 17 ("per chi vuole ingravidare, che mandragola si chiama").</page><page sequence="37">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 37 but conspicuous medical Latin, the possible reasons for the couple's failure to procreate. 102 Nam causae sterilitatis sunt: aut in semine aut in matrice, aut in strumentis seminariis, aut in virga, aut in causa extrínseca. 103 It is as a model of sexual differentiation that the traditional account of the mandragola is both remedy and poison is most telling for the meaning of the play. As Callimaco-physician describes the drug, it will impregnate Lucrezia but also kill the first male that lies with her: its effect on the female is vital and benign; on the male, mortal.104 As Aquilecchia has demonstrated, the folklore motif of the poisoned lady, who annihilates her consorts, has been grafted by Machiavelli to the conventional lore of the mandrake found in the encyclopedias and medical texts of the Latin West. But the additional inclusion by Machiavelli of reference to the ordeal of Tobit's bride, Sarah, who must be detoxified for several days before Tobit can expect to survive a night with her,105 points the way to the naturalis- tic referent behind the fabulous lore in the presumed toxicity of the female sex itself - marked most sensationally by the medical myth that the menses have virulent properties. 106 Thus mandragola, in its widest sense, 102. For "scientific" explanation of how the mandrake can aid fertility, we have the account of Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De rerum proprietatibus (1601; repr. Frankfurt, 1964) XVII. 104: "quod mandragora sumpta modo debito matrice disponit ad conceptionem quando primitus calor nimis et siccus conceptionibus materiam impedivit. Mulieres cali- das et húmidas disponit ad conceptionem, cum sit frigida et sicca." Medically, then, the mandrake aids conception only in the special case of a woman who is excessively humid and hot (in traditional medicine women are normally humid and cold); otherwise, like most substances that are cold and dry, the mandrake is toxic and inimical to life. 103. Callimaco's scholastic form of reasoning here parodies Machiavelli's own technique of dividing one question in the first chapter of II principe. For the consequences of Machiavelli's reliance on these patterns of thought, cf. Pocock, pp. 158-159. 104. For the motif of the poisoned lady ("concubitus velenatus"), cf. Aquilecchia. pp. 88-89, and Raimondi, p. 257-258. 105. For the reference to Tobit, see Raimondi, p. 257. The text (in the Vulgate) is Tobit 6:1-22. 106.

MARTINEZ embraces the full gamut of oppositions active in the play: both the opposi- tion of male and female sexual power and the ambivalent power of the drug, the pharmakon, the "remedy" that is both toxic and tonic, potion and poison, virtus and virus. Nicia's outburst when Callimaco-physician informs him as to the hitch in using the potent medicine describes the mandragola exactly, for he calls it a " suzzacchera the name of a medicinal drink composed of vinegar and sugar, both sweet and sour. From this perspective, mandragola, the play's title, is the term that funnels into Machiavelli^ text the coexistence of medicinal and toxic properties, of masculine and feminine aspects, in the defiled but virtuous blood of Roman Lucretia. But there is one more decisive feature of mandragola. Also termed rimedi everywhere in the play are Ligurio's ingenious expedients for overcoming the obstacles to the execution of the plot, which has as its object the fertilization of Lucrezia. 107 Since Ligurio's need for constant resourceful- ness enacts the Machiavellian commonplace that only a superior virtù can repeatedly overcome the obstacles of Fortuna, his rimedi also take their place under the rubric of mandragola, which thus sexualizes every device of the plot. It is perhaps this sexualization of Ligurio's rimedi that accounts for the alliance of Callimaco and Ligurio, for only Ligurio's skill makes Callimaco's sexual energy efficacious. 108 Both Ligurio and Callimaco are finally provided with keys to the "camera terrena" of Nicia's house, for both brains and brawn are needed to complete the execution of the bril- liant beffa. If, in the Prince, Machiavelli compares the successful man of action to a centaur, because he can enlist both intelligence and feral violence for his designs, in Mandragola no single character embodies that ideal. crops do not germinate, wine goes sour, grasses die, trees lose their fruit, iron is corrupted by rust, copper is blackened. Should dogs eat of it, they go mad." 107. For Ligurio's many rimedi, cf. pp. 67, 71 (3 times), 75, 76, 77 (3 times), 79, 83, 91, 94, 95. The three uses on p. 77 (II. 6) show Ligurio inventing new rimedi to overcome fresh obstacles, fulfilling the Machiavellian notion that new and innovative solutions are constantly required for the challenges of Fortune. 108. The sexual dimension of male virtù is rendered most brutally explicit in Machiavelli's notorious reference, in the 25th chapter of the Prince, to Fortune as a woman who must be treated roughly by the man who would master her.</page><page sequence="39">Roman Lucret ia in Mandragola 39 The richness of Machiavelli^ title, which should be rendered without the article ("la favola Mandragola si chiama") so as to preserve its com- prehensiveness, should be evident: mandragola covers nearly everything in the play and, reflexively, the function of the play itself as an ambiguous rimedio administered to its audience. It is both full of the bitterness of the satirist who confesses in the prologue that he, too, knows how to speak ill of others - "sa dir male anch'egli" - and potentially a rimedio offering relief to its author and illumination to its audience, if not the definitive healthy purge that would restore the vigor of the Florentine civic body. The function of mandragola in embracing both the sexual dyad and the ambivalent efficacy of the pharmakon is important for understanding the meaning of the transformation of Lucrezia at the conclusion of the play. As noted above, Lucrezias reported words when presented with Callima- co's proposal display a strikingly healthy faculty of willing.109 By sub- mitting to Callimaco and the "miraculous" power of his sex, she has become a powerful, even commanding figure. Much is at stake here. Nicia's admiring comparison of his wife to the rooster, the phallic totem of carnival virility, testifies to Lucrezia's assumption, through submis- sion, of a masterful power that parallels Roman Lucretia's assumption of heroic virtue through her suicide. In terms of the lore of mandragola , Callimaco's night with Lucrezia has drawn the imaginary toxicity from her body into himself; she, in return, has retained his seed and, in effect, his masculine potency. Translated back into the realistic psychology of the play, Lucrezia enters into the possession of a new and subtle mastery over those who appear to have triumphed over her virtue, just as Lucretia triumphs over her seducer through the effects of her sacrifice. Lucrezia is transformed from the single remaining spark of ancient virtue to the absolute mistress of the corrupt world of the play; as Ligurio puts it early in the play, Lucrezia is "atta a governare un regno," and it is that realm that she inherits at the play's end. Cured of her resemblance to Roman Lucretia, Lucrezia comes to stand 109. V.6, p. Ill: "Io l'ho molto caro, e vuoisi che sia nostro compare"; p. 112: "Dategliene dieci," Lucrezia's last words in the play, order her husband to give ten grossi to Timoteo, echo the circumstances at the conclusion of Decameron VII. 7. 36 ("datigli sette gigliati"): a suggestive parallel, as Peronella, too, has just finished cuckolding her husband in his presence.</page><page sequence="40">40 RONALD L. MARTINEZ for an ambiguous female power that thwarts the ideal political agendas of the male virtù that, in Machiavelli^ typology, strives to conquer history and fortune.110 Indeed, Lucrezia finally represents the female per- sonifications Fortuna and Natura themselves, the traditional adversaries of the designs of masculine desire.111 In this respect the contrast with Ro- man Lucretia is again telling. In Livy's episode, Lucretia is powerful because she becomes like a man, she triumphs over a timorous female nature, she becomes "matrona animi virilis." Through her, the Roman virtue triumphs over nature and natural corruption, restoring the state to its pristine strength. In Mandragola , Lucrezia's submission to Callimaco marks the final defection of ancient virtu' her alteration ("ell' e stamane up po' alterata," Nicia remarks) is itself a change of nature, as Callimaco had hoped at the play's outset, that makes her a representative of changeable nature herself, "semper varium et mutabile."112 In her defection, the corruption of nature triumphs over obstinate virtue. The triumph of nature in Lucrezia's ascendancy requires a re-evaluation of the apparent success of Nicia and Callimaco in the play. For the consummation of Ligurio's ingenious plot marks the defeat not only of ancient virtue but also of the illusion of Callimaco's (and Nicia's) triumph. It is clear, in retrospect, that Nicia and Callimaco have been driven by Nature and Fortune throughout the play: Nicia because he wishes to preserve his fortune by propagating himself - the work of Natura - and Callimaco because it was Dame Fortune herself who in- flamed his desire with the verbal images of Lucrezia's beauty.113 Indeed, 110. For this view of male virtù in Machiavelli^ works, see Gilbert, pp. 192-198; and Pocock, pp. 156-182, esp. p. 167, for an acute analysis of virtù as finally self-destructive. 111. For Machiavelli's view of virtù besieged by fortune - which it can surmount - and by nature, which it cannot, see his letter 119 (ed. Gaeta, 1961, pp. 230-231); also II principe XXV (ed. Cantimori, pp. 92-94); Discorsi, III. 9; "capitolo di fortuna," w. 108-114 (ed. Gaeta, Il teatro . . ., p. 315). For discussion, cf. Pocock, p. 180. 112. For the problem of mutability, cf. Discorsi, 1.42. For an analysis of corruption as an irreversible change of nature, see Pocock, pp. 207-208. 113. That Nicia is victimized by his desire for offspring is clear from the play; but Callimaco, too, is shown driven by a libido beyond his control: he threatens repeatedly to adopt violent remedies or destroy himself; e.g., 1.3 (p. 67); IV. 4 (p. 97): "io mi gitterò in Arno o io mi appiccherò o io mi gitterò da quella finestra o io mi darò d'un coltello in sullo uscio suo." In Act IV. 1 (p. 92) Callimaco gives a description of his condition ("le gambe</page><page sequence="41">Roman Lucretia in Mandragola 41 as the play progresses Callimaco and Nicia, whose relationship is es- tablished with exchanges of university Latin, become increasingly similar. Not only are they to be god-fellows, compari , because Lucrezia wills it, but their names, already linked by common recourse to military etyma, are doubly related: as echoes of Machiavelli 's reliance on Boccaccio's character Calandrino (Dec. 8.3, 6; 9.3, 5) and on Bibbiena's related Calandro (from the Calandria) as models for Nicia; and as dispersed homophonies of Machiavelli's own full name.114 Thus Calandro/Calandrino's prefix dis- appears from Nicia's first name and reappears in front of his last (Cz/fucci) and in Calli maco's name, while Niccolò Machiavelli yields the elements of Nicia and Callimaco. The point, I believe, is that Nicia becomes Callima- co's true father, which means that Callimaco is destined to become, in his turn, another Nicia. If Lucretia's suicide provides the perfect opportunity for the "stupefied" Brutus to become miraculously wise and purposeful, the translatio stultitiae conducted by Nicia in Lucrezia's bedroom marks the initiation of Callimaco into a household ruled and represented by the idiotic Nicia. 115 As a figure of Nature and Fortune, Lucrezia is, at the conclusion of the play, the mistress of a world wholly in the grip of those two powers because of the loss of the ancient resolve to stand at any cost against the triemono, le viscere si commuovono, il core mi si sbarba del petto . . .") that, as Rai- mondi notes (p. 202) is taken from Lucretius's sharply satirical view of erotic passion in the De rerum natura III. 152-158. 114. Machiavelli's flair for playing with names is beyond doubt. The protagonist of the Clizia, Nicomacho, is a collapsed version of Niccolò Machiavelli (cf. Ridolfì, p. 247). For the meanings of the names Nicia ( = victorious) and Callimaco ( = beautiful in battle) cf. R. Sereno, "A Note on the Names of the Personages of Machiavelli's Mandragola Italica , XXVI (1949), 56. Machiavelli's own nickname, Machia (cf. Ridolfì, p. 210), represents an operation on Machiavelli similar to that of Nicia on Niccolò. Machiavelli was, of course, well aware from Thucydides and Plutarch that Nikia was the name of the Athenian general who led the disastrous Sicilian expedition during the Peloponnesian War; cf. Discorsi, 1.53; III. 16. 115. As Hugo Rahner points out, Dioscorides gives as one of the names of mandragola the term morion, because the drug made from the plant is narcotic. In the context of our play, however, it might be suggested that the effect of mandragora in the broadest sense is stupidity. Cf. Rahner, p. 224, citing De materia medica, IV, 75, 7.</page><page sequence="42">42 RONALD L. MARTINEZ entropy of history. 116 A remarkable episode placed at the very heart of the play suggests, in an oblique but highly suggestive way, the depth of Machiavelli 's melancholy understanding of the failure of the Florentine republic. In the third act (scenes iv, v, vi of twelve) Ligurio tests Timoteo's willingness to cooperate with the plan against Lucrezia by first suggesting an even more scandalous scheme: Timoteo is to persuade the abbess of a nunnery to administer a pozione to the pregnant daughter of Cammillo Calfucci so that she will miscarry. Citing the advantages to all concerned, and garnishing his reasoning with hints of subsequent contri- butions to the Church, Ligurio overcomes the pliant scruples of Timoteo, who agrees to attempt the service. The episode is striking for being an inverse parallel to the principal action of the play. Both of Ligurio's schemes are rimedi that entail administering a pozione. In one case, how- ever, the object is impregnation; in the other, abortion. Both schemes call out the formulaic Machiavellian skill in assessing the pros and cons of a plan. In one case that skill is applied by Ligurio: Observe how much good results from the course of action: you maintain the honor of the monastery, the girl's reputation and that of her family . . . and on the other hand you offend nothing more than an insensible unborn piece of flesh, which can be lost in a thousand ways [che in mille modi si può sperdere ] (III. v. 84) in the other case, by the newly converted Timoteo, who persuades Ma- donna Lucrezia with the same kind of argument: "el fine si ha a riguardare in tutte le cose: el fine vostro si è riempire una sedia in paradiso, con- tentare il marito vostro." Another, deeper similarity also links the two schemes: the economy of sacrifice. In the scheme that Nicia accepts, adopting the treatment of mandragola for Lucrezia, a provision is made for the sacrifice of the sur- rogate who is to absorb the toxic properties of the drug. The life of the garzonaccio, whose ugliness and social marginality mark him as a tradi- tional scapegoat, a pharmakos , is to be the price of the rejuvenescence of 116. For the destructive forces of the historical process, cf. Discorsi II. 5; Gilbert, p. 198; Pocock, pp. 2 16-2 18. As Pocock points out, the republican system of Rome was also intrinsically unstable, though a virtuous republic can concentrate its energies and succeed politically for a long time.</page><page sequence="43">Roman Lucret ia in Mandragola 43 Lucrezia and the household of Calfucci. By contrast, in Ligurio's test scheme for Timoteo the sacrificial victim is the imaginary unborn infant of Calfucci's imaginary daughter. That an infant, the desired object of the major plot, is the sacrificial victim of the imaginary microplot is not merely an exposure of the moral flexibility of the principal conspirators. The point of the episode is to place at the play's center a symbol of that which, in the full Machiavellian sense, is sacrificed by all the characters in the play: the "antica virtù" itself, precisely that which, in the Roman tragedy of Lucretia, is born. Ligurio argues to Timoteo that the abortion of the fetus is trivial because it tends to be lost in so many ways, "in mille modi si può sperdere." His idiom is hauntingly reminiscent of a passage in the Discourses where Machiavelli points to the multiple ways in which a republic may be betrayed: ... no adequate remedies existing for similar disorders arising in republics, it follows that it is impossible to establish a perpetual republic, because in a thousand unforeseen ways its ruin may be accomplished [per mille inopinate vie si causa la sua rovina]. (III. 17) One of the funniest plays ever written, Mandragola holds at its heart an etiological fable of the defection of ancient virtue and the failure of a free republic. The tale of Lucretia, for Machiavelli the inception of a Utopian ideal of civic virtue, gives the measure that permits Mandragola to be grasped as the etiology of dystopia.</page></plain_text>
