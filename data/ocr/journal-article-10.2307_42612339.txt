Such recognition typically falls to clergy - "Dr. Peale's Church" - if only because they often hold their positions longer than most vestrymen and from the pulpit are the church's daily face to the world. But sometimes a vestryman, serving at the rector's side, adds his imprint to the church's name and face, and in New York's St. George's Church, on Stuyvesant Square (2nd Avenue and 16th Street), this has happened twice: first, with J. P. Morgan, a warden of the church from 1885 to 1913, and then with Charles C. Burlingham, a warden from 1934 to 1959. Of the two, Morgan, because of his bank, is the more famous, but in parish history not just because of his money. When in 1881 the vestry debated removing the church to Madison Avenue at 70th Street, to follow its congregation uptown, Morgan supported the decision to stay put and minister to the immigrants who were replacing the neighborhood's old New York families and turning the single-family houses into crowded tenements. Moreover, he had an active role in hiring the new rector, William S. Rainsford, brought in to reorganize the parish and to make St. George's a great urban church with myriad social and religious programs designed to reach all people, but especially the poor, illiterate, and ill-housed. To that end, under Rainsford and Morgan, St. George's in 1883 became the first large Episcopal [Anglican and Episcopal History, 2003, vol. LXXII.

And among those it reached with its programs, many remembered Morgan not only as a banker on Wall Street but also as a churchman with a hand in their lives on Stuyvesant Square. Even fifty years after Morgan's death in 1913 an elderly taxi driver, dropping a passenger at the parish house, could exclaim: "Why didn't you say you meant Morgan's church?"2 Burlingham's later role in St. George's history, though less powerful and less often recalled, is in some respects more interesting because based not at all on the power of money. In his career as an admiralty lawyer Burlingham achieved comfort and financial independence, but was never rich, and never sought to be. His great case, lasting from April 1912 to December 1916, was defending the White Star Line against claims for loss of life and property in the sinking of the Titanic. He argued it up to the U. S. Supreme Court and then, as directed, started again in the Southern District Court in New York. Finally, after four and a half years and before the court reached a decision, he won a settlement: White Star to pay $664,000 on claims totaling roughly $18,000,000, less than four percent of the potential liability. The case won him a national and international reputation and established him as a leader of the New York admiralty bar. More personally, it gave him financial freedom to devote more time to public affairs. 1 Pew rentals: see Henry Anstice, History of St. George's Church in the City of New York, 1752-1811-1911 (New York, 1911), 292-94; William S.

BURLINGHAM 325 He had always played a role in efforts to reform the city's government, to moderate Tammany Hall's one-party rule, and in particular, to end Tammany's corruption of the city and state courts: patronage in the appointment of clerks and judges, the frequent buying of judgeships, and warping of court decisions. After the Titanic case, he worked more continually in reform movements of all kinds and in 1933 was a leader in the Fusion movement that elected La Guardia to the first of three terms as Mayor of New York. For most of those twelve years, though Burlingham, now usually called "CCB," held no official post and sought none, he was an advisor to La Guardia who consulted him almost daily on every sort of issue. As one of La Guardia's biographers wrote: CCB "had a world of experience, and mature wisdom to match. His judgment was as sound as could be had; he coveted no office, was entirely self-sufficient, and had received all the honors he needed in his full life... From this remarkable man, and from almost no one else, La Guardia would take criticism, and even sometimes be diverted from ill-considered plans."3 And the same, to a lesser extent, was true of CCB's relation to Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the latter's two terms as Governor of New York and four as President of the United States. As the depression deepened and World War II threatened, the city was deeply involved with the federal government, and its newspapers discovering CCB's behind-the-scenes role, for the last twenty-five of his hundred years, 1934-1959, celebrated him as "New York's First Citizen."4 What he had was influence, not power. He had no constituency to offer the politicians at the polls; he controlled no votes. And his influence, aside from its wisdom, was lodged in his personality: a cheerful, optimistic oudook; a strong moral cast to his thinking and 3 Charles Garrett, The La Guardia Years: Machine and Reform Politics in New York City (New Brunswick, 1961), 127; see also, August Heckscher, When La Guardia was Mayor, New York's Legendary Years (New York, 1978), 159-160. 4 The earliest use of the term "First Citizen" seems to be in an editorial in The Nation , 30 August 1933, v. 137, n. 3556, 231, praising CCB for his part in creating the Fusion Party that had the major role in nominating and electing La Guardia to be mayor.</page><page sequence="5">326 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY expression; a mind capable of grasping and stating issues clearly; a gift for words, phrased often in a pithy informal style; and always, grace in defeat. He continually reminded La Guardia and Roosevelt of first principles, of the right action to take, even if difficult. And often the politicians listened. But sometimes not. One instance in which La Guardia as mayor was not persuaded by CCB was the city-wide uproar that gradually arose over the appointment in 1939 of the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell to teach some advanced course in philosophy at the City College of New York. The appointment was to run for three semesters, seventeen months, in 1941 and 1942. Because Russell's views on sexual freedom were well-known and far advanced for the decade, the Episcopal bishop of the New York diocese, William T. Manning, in letters, sermons, and speeches began to preach a crusade against Russell, not for his mathematics or philosophy, but for his morals. And Manning succeeded in alarming not only many conservative Episcopalians but almost all the city's Roman Catholics. CCB, who personally had no use for Russell's views on sexual relations, urged La Guardia to stay out of the fight, but the mayor saw votes in Manning's party of the righteous, and maneuvered successfully to cancel the appointment. But not before he had been asked in writing by CCB: "Why should a man with your record in a free country do to the CCNY what the Nazis have done to Heidelberg and Bonn?" First principles.5 Meanwhile, in the years 1934 to 1959, among those who dealt with CCB on city affairs, whether legal, political, journalistic, or religious, St. George's increasingly was referred to as 5 Heckscher La Guardia, 273, quoting CCB to La Guardia, 18 April 1940. The letter, before and after the sentence quoted, states: "I strongly urge you to direct Chanler [the City's Corporation Counsel] to consent to appeal. I seriously doubt his right to tell the Board of Education they cannot appeal and I regard this refusal... as high-handed... You know how foolish I think the Department of Philosophy and the Board of Higher Education were in nominating and appointing Russell, and how abhorrent Russell's doctrines are to me. But why should a man... [as quoted]... Heidelberg and Bonn?... Your attempts to dispose of the case while it was in the courts was bad enough; but to prevent the Board appealing to higher courts is far worse... It is not YiYeyou."</page><page sequence="6">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 327 "Burlingham's church." To a remarkable extent, the church's vestry, congregation, and clergy seemed one with him, sharing his beliefs, which in personal life were rather conservative, but on social and economic issues, rather more liberal than might be expected. St. George's was one of the first of New York's "white" churches to admit a "black" into its choir, in 1894, and that man, Harry T. Burleigh, who sang with the choir for fifty-two years, became a much loved, much respected member of the parish.6 And one of CCB's programs, which he kept before La Guardia, was the appointment of the first African-American judge, in 1936, to the city's Magistrates Court.7 Similarly, with the church's rector, Edward O. Miller, at the annual conventions of the diocese of New York, for ten years Burlingham led the fight to allow women to serve as delegates to the conventions and on church vestries, just as in another field he steadily campaigned to open law schools and bar associations to women. And in 1957 St. George's became the first church in the diocese to elect a woman to the vestry.8 CCB was not born an Episcopalian but was the son of a Baptist preacher, and he did not officially enter the Episcopal fold, at St. George's, until 1891, by which time he was thirty-three, married, with three children, and with his ideas on religion set. Even then 6 Moulton St. George's , 86-88, 116, 133-34; also, Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 4, 125-26: "Burleigh was a short, dignified, dapper man who looked twenty or more years younger than his age. He was noted for his infectious enthusiasm for life, music, and poetry - which he read in French, Latin, German, Italian, and Hebrew - and for his generosity to struggling black musicians." One of the oddities of contemporary journalism, and perhaps of contemporary desire to see everyone as a victim, occurred in Episcopal Life, November 1994, 6, in reporting the reburial of Burleigh in his hometown of Eirie, Pennsylvania. The reporter dismissed Burleigh's fifty-two years at St. George's as merely "living most of his life in New York City," while stressing, by quoting the eulogist, that "Burleigh intimately knew the racism and prejudice directed towards African-Americans." 7 He was Myles A. Paige, appointed 2 September 1936. Paige had gone to Harvard, had put himself through Columbia Law School while working as Pullman porter, and since had done a great deal of church and community work. In 1940 La Guardia promoted him to the city's three-man court of "super magistrates," the Court of Special Sessions. 8 She was Mrs. Henry Hill Pierce, see Moulton St. George's, 113, 120.</page><page sequence="7">328 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY the decision seems to have been as much of a compromise with his Episcopal-born wife as an act of individual faith. Yet the die cast, he entered his new church with hope and energy, intending to make its life his own. When he died, on 6 June 1959, in his hundred and first year, Burlingham left no published record of his life beyond what appeared in New York's daily newspapers, in various law reviews, and in such journals as St. George's Bulletin and Who's Who.9 But these, written by others, though fulsome, dwell almost exclusively on his legal and political accomplishments, such as his part in starting the judicial careers of Learned Hand and Benjamin N. Cardozo, two of the twentieth century's greatest jurists, and on his roles in La Guardia's terms as mayor, and of Roosevelt's as governor and president. Happily, Burlingham's family preserved a trunkful of letters written while he was at Harvard College and starting life as a young lawyer in New York, and these reveal the foundations of his religious beliefs and life.10 His father, Dr. Aaron H. Burlingham, had been a child on the frontier in Western New York, who at age twenty-one, turned eastward to educate himself at Hamilton Literary &amp; Theological Institution, Hamilton, New York, then the center of Baptist theology in the state.11 After five years of self-support he graduated from the college, and in two more from the divinity school, and took a succession of small churches in Pennsylvania and New York 9 Also, in the Dictionary of American Biography , Supplement 6, 1956-60, 87-88, written by Jerold Simmons. Felix Frankfurter published an account of CCB in Harvard Law Review, January 1961, v. 74. n.3, 433-40. The Association of the Bar of the City of New York, in its journal The Record , December 1959, v. 14, n. 9, published three memorials to CCB by prominent city lawyers: Edward S. Greenbaum, Lloyd K. Garrison, and Harrison Tweed. 10 In my biography of CCB, to be published by Far rar, Straus &amp; Giroux, this collection is titled "the Schmiderer Collection" or, in short-hand, CCB-TFS. And will be so referred to hereafter. Timothy F. Schmiderer is CCB's eldest great-grandchild. 11 The Hamilton Institution at the time had four buildings, housing a preparatory school for the college (called the Academic Department), the college, and the theological school. These schools, in 1846, changed their name to Madison University, and still later to Colgate University.</page><page sequence="8">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 329 State. In 1856 he was called to a Baptist church in New York City, on 25th Street, where he stayed nine years, and where his second son Charlie, born in 1858, lived until seven. Then, according to CCB, his father one day "had a quarrel with one of his deacons" and resigned.12 Selling his house, he took his family to England, preaching as a guest in many churches, and for the winter of 1865- 66 taking a post as minister in what was then known as "the American Chapel in Paris." The chapel was at the time the only English-speaking church in Paris, and though founded by a Congregational minister had since employed others from a variety of Protestant denominations. The present chaplain, who was departing on a six-month leave, was a Presbyterian. Dr. Burlingham, however, was asked to conduct his services according to Episcopalian usage, a condition to which he agreed, angering some Baptists. His flexibility, however, did not hinder a call in 1866 to a major Baptist church in St. Louis, Missouri, and in late 1866 he took his family there, staying eleven years and performing the great work of his life. His job was to reunite a congregation badly split by the Civil War and, following the growth of the city westward, to move the congregation and church inland from the Mississippi riverfront. In all of this he was successful and is much praised in the church's history.13 Young Charlie received a good education in St. Louis, through sophomore year at Washington College, but was not drawn to life in the West. He strongly resented, for example, that each year when Edwin Booth and his Shakespeare troupe came to St. Louis, and in anticipation CCB, his classmates, and their teacher read the plays scheduled for production, he alone of the class was not allowed to attend the performances - because "I was the son of a Minister," and the Baptists considered it 12 From a memorandum, "Childhood," by CCB in the Charles C.

To which he added, "They made no objection to a circus."14 Apparently the ban, though reflecting the inclination of his father and mother more importantly was imposed by the prejudice of the congregation, and CCB, by the time he was fifteen, seems to have felt that life in the East would be less restrictive. In any case, he regularly read the New York Tribune , to which his father subscribed, and in his sophomore year at Washington arranged, with his father's blessing, to transfer to Harvard College, agreeing on admission to repeat his sophomore year - again, despite the added cost, with his father's blessing. Thus, the transfer to the East was in no way a break with his parents. His mother feared that in Cambridge, the fount of Unitarianism, he might be lured from his parents' faith, but Dr. Burlingham, who himself had left the frontier to seek an education, was sympathetic, and sought for his two boys, with CCB the younger by four years, the best education they could absorb. At Harvard, from which CCB graduated with honors in 1879, he seems to have made no good friends, indeed hardly even an acquaintance. In the letters to his parents that survive and in thirty-two to Annie Hoe, an unmarried family friend, six years older than he and with whom he more freely debated his religious thoughts, he does not mention a single classmate by name. Describing for her his return by train to Cambridge after his sophomore Christmas vacation spent with the Hoe family in New York City, he wrote of a car full of "Harvardites, all rather festive and a few, I am sorry and ashamed to say, rather boozy. I am glad you are not one of those who say: 4 Boys will be boys, you know; they are sowing their wild oats. They will settle down.' Most of them settle down much lower than such people think." Apparently, throughout the seven-hour trip from New York to Boston, though surrounded by fellow students, he sat alone.15 14 Memorandum by CCB, "CCB and the Stage," CCB-HLS, 20:2. 15 CCB to Annie Hoe, 10 January 1877.

BURLINGHAM 33 1 His social isolation throughout his college years, in all three of which he roomed alone, was seemingly self-imposed, but it did not interfere with his intellectual progress. He worked hard, proclaiming himself to his father a "grind,"16 and in senior year was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society.17 Nor did his self concern hinder his religious development. Besides the brief, daily chapel services still required by the college, he initially attended a Cambridge Baptist church, which he soon abandoned in favor of Sunday trips to Boston to hear the famous preachers of the day. Among theses were the evangelists Dwight Lyman Moody, whom he rather liked, and Ira David Sankey, whom he disliked; the Unitarian Edward Everett Hale, whom he found uninspiring; and finally, the Episcopalian Phillips Brooks, who he told Annie was "the best preacher I ever heard."18 Of Brooks, CCB later would declare, "no one has had a greater influence in my life."19 In his first letter to Annie to mention Brooks, CCB, who had spent the Sunday "visiting four churches," with Brooks preaching at the last, reported: He preached on Nicodemus, and one point in his sermon pleased me very much. Speaking of what a mystery is, he said that it was a perfectly plain result with an unknown cause. We are ourselves mys- teries; we know that we live, we feel it, but how we received life we know not. Applying this to the spiritual life, we know not how we have been born again; we only know that we are spiritually alive. The life can not be without birth in the spiritual as well as in the physical sense. 16 CCB to his father, 15 May 1877, CCB-TFS. 17 He seems to have attended only one meeting of the society, in June 1879.

That is the proof of conversion.20 In another letter, he described to Annie a conversation with a classmate who had insisted that if CCB "accepted the Bible as an inspired book," which CCB did, then "I must believe all that is written in it." CCB disagreed. The advances in science had made a literal belief in the Bible impossible. "Do you remember," he asked Annie, "in Phillips Brooks' sermon on the present and future faith, his statement of the character of the times? Till now, Mr. B. says, rocks and ice have been bound fast together. No one could tell what was firm and what was not. Now as the ice breaks up, we can see what is firm, and can cling to that." He added, "For my part, I am glad the ice has begun to 'break up' now. It must have done so sooner or later. Why not now?"21 No doubt in 1879, that view was easier for a young man to assert than for an old. And if CCB was ready to follow Brooks into accepting the ideas of Newtonian physics and Darwinian evolution, displacing man from the center of the universe and questioning his creation in God's image, almost surely CCB's father was not - a reason perhaps why CCB confided such thoughts to Annie rather than to his father. After hearing Brooks' preach on Easter Sunday, 1879, CCB wrote to her: Mr. B. in his Easter sermon this morning said, that if we knew what immortality meant and what Christ's love was we could resist all temptations. That is certainly a truer interpretation of the command "Be ye perfect" than that so often given "Be as perfect as you can (and be content with it)"... . . . Annie, I am, I fear, growing heretical. I want to be unorthodox in many things, but I do not want to go further than I ought. Still I do get comfort from some things that I believe. I do not know what God 20 CCB to Annie Hoe, 18 March 1877, CCB-TFS. 21 Ibid., 16 February 1879.</page><page sequence="12">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 333 is. I do not know what personal means when applied to him. I am not anthropomorphic enough to think him like myself. Yet he is incomprehensible to me, a different from me. I know that my inabil- ity to conceive him is no proof against his being. Indeed, although I cannot prove his existence (the a posteriori argument seems of little worth to me), I believe he exists because I often feel him in me. But this faith will not convince others. I said some things comforted me. They are Christ's life and love. When I cannot understand God, I can understand him [Christ].22 This was the core of Brooks' teaching, and remained vital to CCB throughout his life. Though Brooks can be viewed as building a bridge between Unitarian liberalism and Christian orthodoxy,23 the fear of CCB's mother that he might be drawn to Unitarianism proved groundless. Though in later life, during a nervous and emotional collapse, CCB was rescued financially by friends, most of whom were Unitarians, he never wavered in his belief in the centrality of Christ to a religious life. He bothered himself little about issues of theology, summarized in creeds and concepts like the Trinity. What mattered to him was God taking on manhood, coming down to the world, and struggling to make it a better place. For CCB, "Love Thy Neighbor" was equal and like unto "Love Thy God." The hermit, in a cave, worrying about the state of his soul, was no more of a Christian, perhaps less, in the sense of doing God's work, than the man or woman .battling ignorance, disease, or superstition in a tenement. As an adult CCB seldom discussed his religious beliefs, but one day, harassed by a questioning nephew, he burst out: "Belief in God and trust in his over-ruling power form the basis of my character."24 For him, influenced by Brooks, religion was not 22 Ibid., 11 April 1879. 23 See David B.

He prayed daily and even, in anguish, audibly.25 He married a young woman, Louisa Lawrence, who was a . niece of Annie Hoe and who was, in social and financial position, a rank above him. The marriage was happy, and for life, and he used to say with pleasure, "I was just a Baptist pup until Louie took me in hand." His father married them, but at Louie's request, using the Episcopal rite, and though CCB continued frequently to attend Baptist meetings with his parents, he also with Louie became a member of the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation, on Murray Hill at Madison Avenue and 35th Street, where Arthur Brooks, the younger brother of Phillips, was rector. Though less of a preacher than his brother, and with a parish more inclined to high church customs than low, he was highly regarded, and in his church, again because of Louie, the Burlinghams in 1886 had their eldest two children baptized. CCB wrote to his mother: Louie has wanted to have them christened, as perhaps you know. I have objected, but not because I thought it could do any harm, (for as a service of dedication it seems to me very beautiful and appropri- ate), but because I thought it was not a real baptism; but as Mr. Brooks said, even if I felt that way, there was no reason why I should stand in Louie's way. So I yielded.26 Five years later, though the third child also was baptized by Arthur Brooks, they joined St. George's Church, though it lay a good bit further from their home on 38th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, an area CCB characterized as "the slummish slopes" of Murray Hill. In their surviving letters they do not discuss their decision, but one speculation seems likely. The church, in its customs, was low Episcopal, and the Incarnation was, if not high, certainly higher. St. George's, therefore, was 25 Audible prayer: Lloyd K. Garrison, see n. 9. 26 CCB to his mother, 26 May 1880, CCB-TFS.</page><page sequence="14">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 335 doser in its rituals and emphasis on preaching to the Baptist church. Its leader was considered a rector, not a priest; it had a communion table, not an altar, and on the table, no cross or candles. On the wall behind the table hung the tablets of the Law, flanked by the Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' Creed. So great were considered the perils of Rome and idolatry that not until 1950, in a service staged to demonstrate "the wide range of ceremonial used in Episcopal churches to express our common liturgy," would copes and mitres be worn by the clergy and incense swung in the aisles. And not until 1976, seventeen years after CCB's death, would the communion table bear candles. In 1891 the rector was William S. Rainsford, a preacher in the Phillips Brooks mould, and in old age CCB declared, "Rainsford drew us to St. George's." In the coming years, however, Louie lost interest in the church whereas CCB's enthusiasm for it strengthened, so that in their family life, and in the eyes of parishioners, and ultimately of the city, it became "Ais church." Evidently, from the start he made himself useful in small jobs, and in 1914 was elected to the vestry. By that time one of the church programs on which he worked hard, one not fully achieved until 1919, was the establishment of free health and dental clinics, the first in the city to be set up by a church for a community and designed chiefly, but not exclusively, for those living in the nearby tenements. The health of children in the public school system had been a concern of CCB when a member of the city's Board of Education, and even after leaving the board he had followed closely the public school programs. Moreover, in 1908, he had served as chairman of the Committee on Physical Welfare of School Children, sponsored by the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (later the Community Service Society). St. George's clinics, however, were aimed primarily at the Italian and Russian Jewish immigrants who were beginning to replace the Germans and Irish in the blocks south of St. George's. The work of setting up the clinics was shared by CCB and his fellow vestryman Dr. James Wright Markoe, the Morgan family's</page><page sequence="15">336 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY personal physician who had cared for the elder Morgan until his death in 1913 and then for his son, J. P. Morgan, Jr. On the advice and planning of Markoe, the elder Morgan in 1902 had built on Stuyvesant Square and funded, entirely alone, the New York Lying- In Hospital, which in its early years handled sixty percent of all hospital births in Manhattan.27 Two years after Morgan's death, Markoe, in a news story widely reported, had cared for Morgan's son who had been shot (not fatally) by a deranged man who insisted that the younger Morgan, if only he would, could stop the First World War. In working with CCB to establish the health and dental clinics, Markoe essentially was in charge of the medical side of the health clinic, and CCB, in charge of all else. The health or nutrition clinic started service in March 1919, available to anyone three afternoons and one evening a week, free. The doctor, recruited by Markoe, was a specialist in child health and was backed by the parish nurse, aided by volunteers. The dental clinic was slower to open, and on 3 January 1920 CCB wrote to his dentist, Dr. George E. Rice: Here is a check for you to help meet the H. C. L. [high cost of living]. And how about my dental chair that you were to get me for St. George's, cheap as dirt, or cheaper? And the fine set of second-hand tools from a dead dentist - if they ever die? We need them right away. We have a nutrition clinic, with 250 children on our list, and they need to have their teeth looked after. My hope is that if I get a fine, handsome chair and set of tools, some kind lady or gent will come in and see them and say, "Where is the dentist?' and we will say, "he is not yet caught or bought," and she or he will say, "I will pay for him for a year or less."

BURLINGHAM 337 On Sunday 18 April 1920, the church Bulletin announced: "A dental chair and complete equipment have been secured and are now on view in the Clinic." And it all but promised a dentist to begin work in the near future. That same day, at the church's mid- morning service, a small, shabbily-dressed man, intending to shoot J. P. Morgan, Jr., fired a pistol point blank at the vestryman offering him the collection plate, and Markoe fell in the aisle, a bullet in his left forehead. Rushed to the Lying-in Hospital, he was declared dead. The shooter, tackled in Stuyvesant Square, had escaped from a mental institution. Despite the loss of Markoe, the clinics throve, so that the doctor in charge for her 1926 report could state: "The children who came to us as babies seven years ago have now passed through the first years of childhood and arrived at school age and comparative safety as far as health is concerned." CCB, as the clinics' administrative head, gave the figures: Visits to the nutrition clinic of babies, school children, boys over 12, and adults totaled more than 8,000, not including examinations of 589 for various summer programs. Visits to the dental clinic totaled nearly 2,000. The cost to the church for the previous year, with no value assigned to volunteers, was $8,361.13, incurring a deficit of $377.20. All the figures went into CCB's annual appeal for contributions. Meanwhile, early in 1925 CCB in his church activities ran into a personal embarrassment. The rector, Karl Reiland (1912-1936), had suggested that CCB be elected to the post of junior warden, but the senior warden, Robert Fulton Cutting, a city leader in finance and good works of all kinds,29 while enthusiastic for the nomination had a raised a question, to which CCB replied by letter: "You are quite right. I have never been confirmed. I have put it off, waiting for a more convenient season, and I have become a little shy about it, I think. I ought to have been confirmed with my children."30 So, in place of himself, he recommended the 29 For a mini-biography of Fulton Cutting, see Moulton St. George's, 71. Among other posts held, he was the first president of the Citizens' Union, founded in 1897. He was a vestryman of St. George's from 1883-1907, and a warden from 1907-34 - fifty-one years. 30 CCB to R.

Wickersham, who after four years in Washington as attorney general for President Taft had returned to New York and was devoting much time to St. George's. As CCB pointed out to Cutting, "We have not always been in step with the diocese, and I think that Wickersham would help us in that regard." He was hinting - what he knew Cutting would grasp - that the bishop and his assistants liked to associate with the rich and powerful, and Wickersham, though personally modest, came clothed in the aura of great office. In addition, as Cutting no doubt remembered, CCB was the one who most recently had put the church out of step with the New York diocese. Only three years earlier, at the 139th annual diocesan convention, held in 1922 on the grounds of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, CCB as a lay delegate from St. George's had publicly questioned the wisdom of William T. Manning, the reign- ing bishop. Manning had opened the convention with a speech calling on all his clergy and communicants to support the Volstead Act, "to see prohibition fairly tried, and to stand in this matter with their whole strength for that respect for law which is vital to the life of our country and which is the first obligation of loyal citizens." The statement, delivered in sonorous tones by a bishop in full regalia, seemed one to which no delegate could take exception. CCB, however, immediately rose and introduced for the delegates' consideration a resolution that began: "We recognize the right of citizens to protest against the Volstead Act and to seek by all proper and legal methods to secure its modification or repeal." Agreeing that of course everyone must obey the law, he pointed out that its burden fell very unevenly on rich and poor. The rich easily could evade it at their "clubs, in restaurants, and social parties," a fact that led the poor to "class antagonism" and "class hatred." His resolution was referred to a committee on miscellaneous business, but the next day the delegates passed in its place a resolution that "This convention records its emphatic approval of the sentiments expressed in the Bishop's address regarding obedience to the law." To the bishop's supporters, CCB's resolution was just the sort of impertinence that St. George's too often produced.</page><page sequence="18">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 339 So, in 1925 Wickersham became junior warden and, on Cutting's death in 1934, senior warden, at which time CCB became junior warden. Two years later when Wickersham died, CCB became senior warden, which he remained until his death in 1959. No record of his confirmation has been found, but it never again was questioned. Apparently, as time passed, everyone simply presumed that such an active vestryman was a communicant. Meanwhile, he took communion regularly. Presumably, at some point in the distant past, he had begun the practice. But at the diocesian convention for 1922, if someone in the bishop's party had known that CCB had not been confirmed, he could have been challenged, ruled improperly present, and ejected. Meanwhile, the two clinics continued useful, and by 1933 annually had about 17,000 calls. During the depression and start of World War II, however, when the church's income declined, the number of calls also dropped, partly because of improvement under La Guardia in the city hospitals and public health department. In 1942, St. George's, having made a survey, published a report on "Why a Clinic?" The church had discovered, perhaps to its own surprise, "many single self-supporting people as well as families in our Parish who hesitate to accept the free service of the city hospitals, and yet can barely meet the fees of a private doctor. Also there are many health situations closely linked with other problems of so personal a nature that the Church is peculiarly fitted to be of help; for the church alone among modern institutions, is interested in the 'whole man' - his body, his mind and his spirit." Accordingly, St. George's continued its clinics, charging a moderate fee (often waived), but with reduced hours, fewer staff, and a greater reliance on volunteers. Finally, in 1949, after thirty years of service, the vestry closed the clinics, chiefly because the number of hospital and dental facilities in the neighborhood had increased. With the funds released, the vestry then founded an experimental school for three to five year-olds, which soon proved a success, drawing parents as well as children to the church.31 31 See Moulton, St. George's, 148.</page><page sequence="19">340 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY During World War II, the church's rector was Elmore M. McKee (1936-46). Though an exceptional leader in parish activities, he probably is more often recalled because in time of war he was a pacifist. He had never made a secret of his belief, preaching his first sermon on pacifism four weeks after to coming to St. George's. But as war approached, many parishioners wondered how he could continue as rector. CCB, as senior warden, put his thoughts on the issue in a letter to Allen Wardwell, a leading partner in the law firm of Davis Polk and a vestryman at St. George's from 1920 to 1953.32 I was not impressed by Elmore's letter to you. It seemed to me rather muddy. His pacifism, he says, is not a philosophy; it comes from his idea of relationship as distinguished from values, which in turn comes from his understanding of the meaning of the Incarnation. I am no philosopher and need to be taught the meaning of the term. His concrete illustration of the parachutist in his backyard I can understand. He would spare his life for the possibility of a future relationship and would not kill him for the sake of Liberty, an "abstraction." Well, I would spare the fellow unless I thought he was about to kill my wife or child or do some mortal injury to my country. I suppose these religious pacifists take our Lord's words literally. I don't. I think He laid down principles. To love one's enemies and to resist no evil do not seem to me inconsistent with killing a man who is seeking to kill innocent children, women and men for his own selfish purposes. But enough of this. I tell Elmore that the pacifists love peace no more than we do, that as we respect his opinion so he should respect ours. He is a true Christian and no fanatic. Your attitude toward him I share.33 32 Ibid., 118. Wardwell had a deep interest in music, and not only at St. George's, where music was exceptional; he also served on the board of directors of the Metropolitan Opera Association and was counsel for the Juilliard Foundation. 33 CCB to Allen Wardwell, 22 September 1940, CCB-HLS, 19:14.</page><page sequence="20">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 34 1 So, in St. George's tradition of mutual respect for different views, McKee continued as rector. The vestry, however, did not allow him to use the church for a meeting of the Episcopal Pacifist Fellowship, a group of which McKee was a vice-president. The vestry feared that such a gathering, sure to be reported by newspapers, would suggest to the public that St. George's, its vestry, and parishioners, were mostly pacifists - when the great majority were not. On the other hand, McKee could continue to preach pacifism within the church, for such was St. George's tradition of a "free pulpit." Even shortly before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, according to a later Herald Tribune report, McKee "opposed such preparatory measures as the establishment of air raid precautions, on the ground that they tended to create a receptive attitude toward war. He argued that we should exert our efforts in the other direction, toward bringing about reconciliation among nations." After Pearl Harbor, McKee offered his resignation to the vestry, but it asked him to stay on. While CCB supported McKee's right to preach pacifism, he exercised his similar right to work actively for those who believed differently. In these years St. George's annually in January invited Reinhold Niebuhr to preach, and the occasion always was treated as special. Niebuhr opposed pacifism, and in November 1940, he and other church leaders founded ajournai that soon became well- known, Christianity and Crisis. Its purpose, in CCB's words, was "to express the attitude of the Christian Church toward the war." In asking a friend to help with the cost of "a new little paper of eight pages to be published fortnightly," CCB explained: The idea we have is to publish four pages of news from Europe, such for instance as a talk by the Archbishop of York, or a report of the state of the Lutheran Church in Germany, etc., which would not be likely to appear in the daily press or in religious papers... we expect to send out through the country several thousand to clergymen on the list of the Federal Council of Churches in order to enlighten them on the issues and tell them what's what. The pacifists are a very small body, but they make an awful noise and have done a lot of</page><page sequence="21">342 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY harm with young people. No one who hasn't had a good deal to do with the clergy knows how ignorant they are.34 The journal, in seeking subscribers, described its purpose more formally: To present the bearing of Christian faith upon the international and social issue of our day. While its columns will welcome pacifist contri- butions, its own view-point will dissent from Christian pacifism. Rather, it will elaborate the historic Protestant faith which holds that in history men must choose between relative goods, and even insists that only such relative choices are possible. Therefore, it will refute pacifist interpretations of our faith which seek, vainly we believe, to practice an absolute perfection in historic decisions, and thereby are betrayed into submission to tyranny. Our analysis of the present world crisis would reveal it as a peculiarly vivid illustration of the evil forces which men must always combat and the baffling alternative which always demand their decision. This position compels us to advocate that Christians enlist their resources in defense of democratic civilization, despite its obvious imperfections, against the totalitarian menace which imperils all Christian as well as humanistic values.35 The statement, probably drafted by Niebuhr and worked over by others, including CCB, articulated CCB's views. To friends in England, he wrote: "The head and front of Xianity and Crisis is Reinhold Niebhur... He is reputed very able. He is too deep for me and his style is deep and Germanic." CCB described himself to his friends as a "merely nominal" editor of the paper. Niebuhr, 34 Thomas D. Thacher Collection, at Yale's Sterling Memorial Library, 2:13, CCB to TDT, 12 November 1940. Niebuhr's daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, in her article "The Serenity Prayer," Yale Review, January 1998, v. 86, n. 1, 38, states: "But beyond the college chapels where he [RN] was a hardy perennial, only two or three churches welcomed him. One was St. George's..." 35 CCB to TDT, 12 November 1940, TDT-YSML, 2:13.</page><page sequence="22">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 343 however, evidently thought of him as something more, and five years later CCB still was editing in detail a statement for "R. N." 36 The journal apparently helped many Protestants wrestle with their beliefs on right and wrong about World War II and the conflicts that followed. Though its circulation was small, initially about 10,000, and never more than 13,000, its influence was large. Typical of its species, it was always in need of financial support, yet survived fifty-two years, closing only in 1993. In those years it opposed anti-Communist "McCarthyism," supported the civil rights movement, and opposed the Vietnam War. CCB's part in its founding doubtless was minor. Still, as was his way, when he saw a need, he took action, and typically more than just by writing a check. In 1946, after the war's end, McKee offered his resignation to the vestry, his main reason being fatigue. The parish was big - its Sunday school, for instance, enrolled more than 2,000 children - and exhausting. The vestry, eager to have him stay, offered him a year's leave of absence. He pointed out, however, that he had come to the Church at age forty, was now fifty, and the job was growing larger, not smaller. In a year or two, new housing in the neighborhood, mostly the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village projects, would bring some 50,000 new residents into the parish. To CCB he confessed: "With steady fatigue has come a decline in zest and the ability to give the steady stimulus needed. The Stuyvesant Town era literally appalls me. It is for a man nearer thirty than fifty, who knows the 'young marrieds' and their children." As CCB knew, the rector in the 1880s, William S. Rainsford, had come to the church in his thirties and after twenty- two years had retired, physically and spiritually worn out. St. George's was an exciting place to work, but it drained its clergy of 36 Christianity and Crisis. CCB to Frank Hirst, 12 May and 26 June 1941: "It has a circulation of nearly 10,000."

CCB admired McKee and regretted his going, but he began a search for a younger man. Meantime, he offered the vestry his own resignation. His reasons were plain: the war was over, he was eighty-eight, and a new era in parish history was beginning. Time for a change. But the vestry said "No:" he was in good health, his contacts in the political, legal, and editorial worlds were valuable, and so, too, was his ability to write a letter to raise money. Besides, the vestry enjoyed his company. He was to get on with the job of finding a new rector. The vestry screened a list of more than a hundred candidates and gradually settled on Edward O. Miller, the assistant minister at Christ Church, Cincinnati. Miller, in some ways reminiscent of Rainsford, was tall, athletic, intense. Though graduating from Harvard College in 1937 with a magna cum laude degree in government, he had felt called to the ministry because of an increasing belief that the world's illness needed a solution more profound than legal revision or treaties. He, meanwhile, had become a stirring preacher and was familiar with St. George's because, while a student at the General Theological Seminary in New York, he had worked for three years as a part-time assistant to McKee. Knowledge of what the post required, however, led him to tell CCB that he was too young: St. George's needed someone older, wiser. "Nonsense," said CCB. "I am 88 and you are 30. That makes an average of 59. What's so young about that?"37 And on 1 December 1946, Miller (aged thirty-one) became St. George's rector. Aware of life expectancy tables, CCB in 1946 must have believed that each year would be his last. Yet the partnership of age and youth, wisdom and energy, continued for another thirteen years, and made a remarkable record of continuing old traditions, the "free pulpit," the Sunday school, the festival services, while 37 Moulton, St. George's, 142.</page><page sequence="24">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 345 meeting new conditions with new solutions. One of Miller's new programs, started in 1949 and aimed "to get church activities out where the people are," was a June "Whitsuntide Fair" on 16th Street, which offered children rides on fire engines, rides on ponies, games with prizes, and cookies galore. In December there was an outdoor crèche with live sheep, and then a much-loved service, started by Rainsford in 1888, "Church Decoration Night," in which, during the singing of "We Three Kings of Orient Are," a star of Bethlehem slowly ascended into the chancel's high arch. For young and old it was, it still is, thrilling. In 1957, the year St. George's became the first church in the diocese to elect a woman to its vestry, it faced a problem of discrimination in New York of another sort. The American evangelist Billy Graham announced a "Crusade" in the city, and St. George's, though an evangelical church, was unsympathetic. In this, it was once again out of step with a majority of the diocese, and CCB turned to Niebuhr for help: I have a very faint recollection - if I can call it that - that you wrote something about Billy Graham a few months ago. If I am right, will you tell me where I can find it... Billy is coming in May, and one vestryman of St. George's, a rather rich banker, has contributed to a fund for Billy. Miller has read to our Vestry passages from a book by Billy, which shows him as an extreme fundamentalist. I think we ought to make plain to the members of our parish why we cannot support Billy in any way. I do not want to get us into open conflict with him, but I wish we could make a mod- erate statement exclusively for members of our parish - reasons we cannot back him. . . Billy's appeal at present is to the rich. They hear that he has reformed drunkards and whoremongers. That is enough for them. Billy's appeal to the churches is chiefly to get from them ushers for the big meetings in Madison Square Garden, etc.</page><page sequence="25">346 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY It has got around that Miller is strongly opposed to Billy, and several clergymen have agreed with him, but they do not wish to get into a row with Billy...38 Niebuhr's article, "Proposal to Billy Graham," had appeared in the August 1956 issue of Christian Century , and in it he articu- lated what bothered many people in Graham's message. After stating his admiration for Graham's "modesty and sincerity in the Christian community," Niebuhr proposed that Graham should incorporate into his message that among the "fruits meet for repentance" should be "a whole-souled effort to give the Negro neighbor his full due as a man and brother." Graham, wrote "Niebuhr, is 'enlightened' on the race issue. He does not condone racial prejudice. But neither does he incorporate the demand of love transcending racial boundaries into his evange- listic appeal. He does not suggest that the soul, confronted with the judgment and the forgiveness of Christ, should regard racial prejudice as an element in the 'life of sin' from the conversion experience redeems." Why not? Because Graham's form of evangelicalism "relies on an oversimplification of the issues in order to create the 'crisis' which prompts conversion and the acceptance of the Christian faith. The best way of inducing this crisis is to call attention to some moral dereliction of the person, in which some accepted moral norm has been transgressed and the conscience is consequently uneasy." The accepted moral norms are most easily found in the Ten Commandments, which list sins we do as individuals, not as communities. Graham's technique, wrote Niebuhr, "requires the oversimplification of moral issues and their individualization for the sake of inducing an emotional crisis. Collective sins are therefore not within the range of a revival." St. George's parishioners had found no difficulty in loving the exceptional Negro individual they had known well, Harry T. Burleigh, the well-known composer and musical arranger of 38CCB to Niebuhr, 28 February 1957, CCB-HLS, 17:3.</page><page sequence="26">CHARLES C. BURLINGHAM 347 spirituals, who had sung in the choir and been an outstanding member of the church for fifty-two years. More complicated were the issues of segregation in public housing, in schools, and in neighborhoods. Niebuhr's article became CCB's touchstone for a Christian's duty on the most profound moral issue of his life's final decade. Through him, and through Miller, Niebuhr's ideas passed into the parish and became, however poorly understood or articulated by some members of the congregation, the majority view of St. George's vestry and parishioners. In that, perhaps, there was little remarkable; but it surely is extraordinary that a ninety-eight year-old man should have been the conduit, the one who remembered the article, sought it out, and then passed it on to his fellow parishioners. For CCB, unhappily, in his physical health the thirteen years he served as senior warden with Miller as his rector, were increasingly difficult. His hearing, already bad, faded further, though with a hearing aid he could converse with an individual or even a small group. His sight, however, grew dim, and then, despite operations for cataracts, both eyes blanked out. His mind, however, remained sharp. Vestry meetings were moved to his apartment, and he, through conversations and being read to, continued abreast of all church activities and, even more remarkably, of much that was happening in the city, in the legal profession, and in Washington politics. A steady stream of visitors came to his apartment, and on Sundays, except during the summer months when he was out of town, he almost always could be found in the church's front, right hand pew, "Deaf Man's corner," directly below the pulpit. There he usually was joined by a vestryman or, for a number of years by Morgan Jones, the retired head usher. On communion Sundays the other deaf parishioners and their families sitting close by watched Jones help CCB up to the communion rail and back into the front pew. It was a contest. Jones believed he gained credit with God if he assisted the old man; CCB gained credit, if he could contain his anger over the unwanted "fussing." For CCB, the moment of greatest danger lay in the return to the pew, at the</page><page sequence="27">348 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY step down. At that moment Jones, for extra credit with the Lord, would pluck assiduously at CCB's sleeve, hand, and arm. If CCB could get back into the pew without pushing Jones away, he would sit straight, triumphant. If he had broken down, brushing off Jones in anger and striking at the unwanted hand or arm, he would slump, defeated. In his last years, CCB sometimes kept a small box of cornflakes beside him in the pew, to provide "sustenance" for the trip to the communion rail and back. By then a more sensitive vestryman had succeeded Jones as helper, and CCB never lost his temper.39 The Sunday "battle" with Jones was visible only to those in the first two or three right-hand front pews. What most parishioners saw was described by one in the months after CCB's death: I never had the privilege of meeting Mr. Burlingham, but in the ten years that I have attended St. George's - and with no idea of who he was - his example of devotion has left an impression upon me that I'll never forget. Certainly his steadfastness has done much toward the stiffening of my spine in many ways.40 He died of kidney failure, on 6 June 1959, at his home in the city, and apparently the last letter he wrote was a note to Miller, following a meeting of the vestry in his apartment: Dear Ed: Last night I did not hear well except what Harvey [Pike] said. I do not think a church should ask a foundation for contributions. If Prot- estants do it, Catholics will. If a church like ours renders public ser- vice such as combating Juvenile Delinquency in Stuyvesant Square such a request might be proper, but to ask a foundation to help make up a church deficit seems to me highly improper. I heard nothing last night of wiping out our deficit. Is that not our immediate duty? 39 Author's personal observation, from the pew behind CCB, and his interview with vestryman John N.

Yet he had always spoken of death without fear, saying that the first thirty minutes after death would be life's most interesting.42 What to make of such a life? Conclusions will vary, but as one who has studied the life, I am most struck by the wholeness of it. Somewhere along in his mid-thirties, CCB more than most of us managed to pull all different sides of himself together: secular interests, profession, family, and, most important, his sense of what, following Christ's example, needed to be done in the world. In so doing he became a remarkably complete person, so much so that what power he had lay not in any particular skill (although a great reader of human character), but in his personality. What impressed people, and impressed them enormously, was himself. And as they increasingly realized, where he pulled all those sides of himself together, privately and publicly, was in his church, an institution offering succor to the "whole man - his body, his mind and his spirit." CCB's ideas of what should be done in the world sprouted in a classical education that stressed a citizen's duty to his city, and in turn were nourished by Brooks' emphasis on the example of Christ, by a succession of remarkable rectors and vestrymen at St. George's, and by acquaintance with Reinhold Niebuhr.

Of course, he had models in his predecessors on the St. George's vestry, but in a more secular age he managed to continue, and perhaps even to further, their example. Given a hundred years to live, he made the most of them. And at his death he probably was still looking forward. He was always a man for the next chapter.
