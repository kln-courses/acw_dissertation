<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers. By Werner Jaeger. Oxford, at the Claren don Press, 1947. Pp. vi, 259. 15s. In this book, which consists of the Gilford Lectures for 1936, Professor Jaeger effectively sets forth the point of view that natural theology had its origin among the early Greek philosophers, as has already been stated by St. Augustine and Cicero, and doubtless by others before them. Originally, however, natural theology was not opposed to super natural theology, as it came to be later, but to the theology of the myths and that of the state religion; that is to say, the contrast was between nature and convention, physis and i/iesis, a division of long standing in many fields of thought. The natural theology of the early Greek philosophers was neglected, according to the author,.by scholars of the positivistic school, who looked on the early Greeks as the pioneers of natural science and were inclined to excuse what seemed to them to be the mere intrusion of half-mythological elements. Nor, on the other hand, is he willing to go to the other extreme of deriving all Greek cosmological thought from mysticism and Orphism, since this procedure tends to make it something irrational. The middle course, he believes, is to note that the new conception of the universe obtained from a rational investigation of reality led to a new view of God or the divine. These terms, he points out, are to be understood not in the Christian but in the Greek sense; and yet out of these beginnings developed the philo sophical theology of Plato, Aristotle and the Hellenistic schools which penetrated the Christian tradition and became an essential ingredient in the universal theology that provided the religious framework of Christian civilization. The early philosophers, according to Professor Jaeger, were foreshadowed by Hesiod, as Aristotle pointed out. Unlike Homer, Hesiod employs the traditional myths to pro mulgate doctrines that are genuinely theological. This is evident in the poet's efforts to schematize the generations of the gods by employing the principle of successive pro creation of the divine generations. This the author considers to be real causal thinking, even though it takes the form of myth. Using this theology as a background Hesiod believes himself capable of answering actual problems of human life, which are interpreted in the light of traditional myths; for example, the theft of fire from the gods by Prometheus and the creation of Pandora, the first woman, brought labor and grief into the world of men, a theological explanation, according to the author, of certain social facts, that may be compared to the biblical account of the Fall of man. The importance of Hesiod in the Greek theological tradition is perhaps most evident in the poet's conception of Eros as one of the oldest and most powerful deities, a conception that was most fruitful in the history of philosophy, as may be seen, for example, in Parmenides and Empedocles. While Hesiod does not yet inquire into the nature of the divine as such, since the gods are accepted as part of the mythological tradition, his theological explanation of the world constituted a heritage accepted by the philosophers who sought the divine by means of reason. The Greek philosophers, in a manner that Professor Jaeger considers unmistakably Greek (to this extent he agrees with Burnet), utilize a form of rational thinking that takes as its point of departure not the traditional myths, as is the case with Hesiod, but the real ities that are presented to human experience. This point of view must have been felt from the outset to be opposed to the mythical explanation of reality, and we might perhaps expect such thinkers to banish all theological considerations from their thinking. But 345</page><page sequence="2">346 TRADITIO this, says the author, would be a false modernization, and he proceeds to show in what sense one should conceive the pre-Socratic philosophers to be theological. With regard to Tha?es, traditionally the first of the philosophers, there is little evidence of any kind. The statement that 'everything is full of gods/ attributed to Tha?es, would indicate that the higher powers in the universe are present in the world about us and do not, like the mythical deities, dwell in some sequestered region. Anaximander, after arguing that the Boundless, which encompasses and governs all things, must be the source of all change in the universe, goes on to say (as indicated by Aristotle) that it is divine, since it is immortal and indestructible. Anaximander, who appears to use the concept of the divine for the first time, does so very naturally, since attributes like immortality, traditionally applied to the mythical gods, are conceived by the philosopher to belong with greater justice to the first principle of being. In this he was followed by many later philosophers. Anticipating that someone may object that Anaximander's god is not one to whom men would pray or that speculation of this kind is not true religion, Professor Jaeger points out that preconceived notions of what constitutes religion should not blind us to the religious significance of Anaximander's conception of the divine; for the idea of endlessness associated with this concept by him must be considered essential to any advanced form of religion. With Anaximander, moreover, theodicy may be said to be joined to theology, since he conceives that coming-to-be and passing-away take place in accordance with a principle of justice that is immanent in the universe; thus the universe becomes for the first time a kosmos. The third of the Milesian naturalists, Anaximenes, continues, according to Professor Jaeger, the idea of divine government of the universe by substituting air for the Boundless of Anaximander, saying that air controls the universe just as the soul within us controls our bodies. Anaximenes takes this step because he feels that the power of thought, which governs our bodies, is necessary also for the govern ment of the universe. In addition, Anaximenes follows Anaximander in deriving 'innumer able gods,' that is, worlds, from the primordial element, another clear indication of the theological trend of his thought. Although these philosophers must have felt that their conception of the divine was opposed to that of the poets, and especially Homer, the educator of Greece, Xenophanes was the first to oppose actively the poetic tradition and transfer the ideas proposed by the new philosophy to the Greek intellectual world at large. He criticized the anthropo morphic conception of the gods handed down in the poetic tradition and insisted that there is a single God in no way like unto mortals, who abides in the same place without moving and sets in motion all things by the power of thought alone. Professor Jaeger offers the opinion that the God of Xenophanes is a personal deity to whom the poet was able to pray. One of the most fruitful conceptions of Xenophanes, as the author well observes, is that of 'what befits the divine nature.' Although the poet uses this idea explicitly in only one place, where he says that it does not befit God to move from one place to another, it provides the criterion of his entire criticism of anthropomorphism. The influence of this conception may be traced far down in the history of theology, and forms in the Church Fathers 'one of the corner-stones of Christian theology/ One of the most interesting points in the development of the author's thesis is his in terpretation of the shadowy world of religion in sixth-century Greece, where he discusses the interrelations of philosophy and the so-called Orphic th?ogonies. He points out that we know much less about the Orphic doctrines of this period than was at one time sup posed, and that there is little reason to believe in the existence of an organized religious community holding tenets vaguely Oriental in origin. We can observe the same ability</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 347 to construct th?ogonies as always existed in the Greek mind, but there is a definite in fluence of the new philosophical point of view on the religious consciousness of the day. Anyone who has attempted an analysis of the Homeric concept of the soul, psych?, and examined the literature on it will appreciate the clear and concise treatment of this problem by the author, who believes that the original meaning of 'breath-sour is the one that can best account for the various uses of psych? in Homer. In the course of time the psych? took over the various functions of mind and emotion as well as that of life, and the notion of transmigration held by the Orphies gave an impetus to the 'development of the idea of the soul as the unity of life and spirit,' and to the attribution of a spiritual in dependence to the soul. This independence of the soul and the eschatology connected with it called for a purity of life to be safeguarded by certain rules. This Orphic concep tion influenced the doctrine of the soul in the philosophy of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and is important for the study of Greek theology, according to the author, since one source of the experience of the divine in Greek philosophical thought was the inner experience by the soul of its connection with a higher realm. In taking up Parmenides, Professor Jaeger considers the proem of his poem not a matter of artistic formalism but one of much importance for an understanding of the philosophical content. It is clear that Parmenides considers the ideas he expresses to be the truth which he has received by revelation from a higher power. The transference of a religious form of expression to philosophy produces a new intellectual world, and it is Professor Jaeger's conviction that the devising of new symbols by the philosopher is just as important an event in the intellectual life of Greece as the formulation of new doctrines. While Par menides effectively connects the knowledge of being with the sphere of religion, he does not identify being with God. The author therefore suggests that we speak of Parmenides' 'Mystery of Being' rather than of his philosophical theology. The 'religious element lies more in the way the man has been affected by his discovery . . . than in any classification of the object of his research as divine.' Heraclitus must be looked upon less as a teacher and scholar than as a prophet attempt ing to rouse his fellow-men from their slumber. The principle which he discovered to be basic in the universe is the unity of opposi tes, not only in cosmology but also in the affairs of human life. This unity of opposites is primarily a divine law of the universe, and it is the foundation of all human laws; the divine law, moreover, is sometimes identified with God, but not in the anthropomorphic manner of the popular religions: 'One thing, the Wise alone, is unwilling and yet willing to be called by the name of Zeus.' In the case of Empedocles there has always been the problem how to relate his two poems, On Nature and the Purifications, one a cosmological treatise, the other a religious work based on Orphic pietism. Professor Jaeger finds the answer primarily in the per sonality and poetic genius of Empedocles, whose flexible and ardent imagination could 'entertain truths of such different orders, preserving each of them in all its absoluteness despite their basic incompatibility.' But, more than this, the poet's philosophy of nature is a theogony replete with mythical imagination; the problem of God for him was the problem of the divine form, since Empedocles did not doubt any more than the Greeks as a whole that there is a divine element manifested in the activity of the world, as set forth in the poem On Nature. 'In the mythical space of a world pervaded with divine figures, the two attitudes so irreconcilable from our abstract point of view will be seen to fit together as two distinct, but in the last analysis basically homogeneous, spheres for the interplay of divine forces.' The Sphere of Empedocles indicates the influence of the idea of unity as he perceived it in Xenophanes and the Eleatics; it is especially akin</page><page sequence="4">348 TRADITIO to the one God of Xenophanes. In the Purifications, on the other hand, the divine is found within the soul itself, and the inner experience of the power of Love and Strife in the soul is reflected in the dualistic control of nature by these two powers. Anaxagoras attempts to find a place for mind within the framework of the physical world, not in an entirely different sphere, as is the case with Empedocles. Starting with the medical notion of mixture he comes to the conclusion that all mind must be unmixed with anything else. Although there is no direct evidence that he called mind divine, this may be inferred with certainty, not only from the hymn-like form of his statements, but from the fact that such epithets as 'infinite' and 'self-ruling' are applied to it. Though earlier thinkers like Xenophanes and Empedocles indicated that consciousness belongs to the highest principle in the universe, Anaxagoras is the first to use mind as a physical principle in the proper sense. In addition, however, Anaxagoras uses mind to explain the ordering of the universe in accordance with a rational plan; in this concept there is im plicit the notion of the good which Socrates later sought in everything, although Anaxa goras does not employ this principle throughout in the explanation of particular phe nomena. This step was left to other thinkers, in particular Diogenes of Apollonia, who in identifying air with the basic principle of the universe gives it the power of thought and, according to the author, was apparently 'the first to try to demonstrate the sway of a purposeful divine thought in nature by interpreting particular phenomena from this point of view.' In the period of the Sophists we meet an entirely new approach to the problem of the divine. There is a widespread scepticism that any certain knowledge of the divine in nature can be obtained, as we see in Protagoras. The whole question is altered by the tendency of this period to make truth subjective and relative. Religion is of interest only as a psychological and social fact whose origin is to be explained and the meaning for human life evaluated. In Xenophon, for example, a pragmatic consideration of the ad vantages to men of a belief in the gods manifests a sympathy with the traditional forms of religion. Prodicus finds the origin of religion in the tendency of the earliest men to look upon those natural forces which are helpful to man as gods to be honored. Democritus explains some religious conceptions as fictions which result from the bad consciences of men, but also indicates that a reverent fear of nature produced in the wise men of a bygone day the earliest conception of deity. It is only a short step to the conviction that a belief in the gods is a device of the state to insure obedience to its laws. This whole approach to the idea of God in terms of human nature and society brings about a crisis, according to Professor Jaeger, in the philosophical idea of God and prepares the way for the Socratic consideration of the 'goal of human life and action.' This inadequate survey of the book is intended to indicate how the author has treated systematically and as a whole an aspect of Greek philosophy and thought that has pre viously been taken up sporadically and in piecemeal fashion. The whole book is per meated by the author's conviction that it is not possible to arrive at an adequate under standing of the Greek intellectual tradition by separating it into compartments, especially when these are relatively recent in their origin. This is especially evident in his treatment of the religious and philosophical approaches to the problem of the divine as manifesta tions of the same Greek intellect, the common element between the two lying 'in the fact that whenever the Greeks experienced the Divine, they always had their eyes on reality, and all their experiences were oriented in that direction.' As a result he considers that, although the spiritual element of the traditional religion seemed at first to have been re placed by the philosophical conception of the universe, this spirit was reinstated in the notion of the divine in nature, which in its development not only altered the idea of Zeus</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 349 (which was always taking on new perspectives) but also came around itself 'to something more like the mythological conception of the gods on a higher stage of the spiral cycle/ In a field of this kind, where it is so often true that the materials are scarce, their value doubtful and their connections tenuous, it requires a scholar of Professor Jaeger's com petence to speak with authority and persuasion. For it is necessary that a writer immerse himself in a problem of this kind so completely that his thinking may be said to be identi fied with that of the thinkers he discusses. Although the author's art in this respect conceals itself through its perfection, the reader is not left unaware of the masterly knowl edge and breadth of thought revealed in the book. When Professor Jaeger, in reading a passage of Aristotle concerning Anaximander, uses as one part of his argument the sound of the passage to a 'philologically trained ear,' he is able to convince us as very few men indeed would be able to do. In interpreting the delicate nuances of fragmentary writings from centuries long past we must depend to a large extent on the ability of a small number (growing smaller, alas!) of men to enter into the spirit of the period, make it their own as far as that is possible and communicate it to others. It is to be expected that specialists in one field or another will feel that Professor Jaeger's treatment neglects their field of interest, but he points out, as is certainly the case, that in a period where the materials have been so thoroughly worked over at various times it is not necessary to take up everything once more in detail. A more serious question will be whether the chief motivating factor of a philosopher in setting forth a given doctrine or using a certain mode of expression is not so much theological, in the author's use of the term, as philosophical, scientific or even literary. But in this matter Professor Jaeger's procedure is cautious and his claims for the theological interpretation are con servative, as, for example, in the case of Parmenides. Certain questions of detail will perhaps always remain controversial, as, for example, the most adequate meaning of psych? in Homer, the relation of the two poems of Empedocles to each other, and the pre cise manner in which we are to interpret certain statements of Aristotle on his predecessors. But the author is always aware of the controversial nature of such questions and of the various answers proposed, and his own answers to all such questions are based on objec tive evidence sifted with the greatest discrimination and fitted most carefully into the general picture of Greek thought and culture. Professor Jaeger has not fallen into the pitfall of reducing the theology of the early Greek thinkers to a single formula or compressing the rich variety of their thought into a narrow framework. He has made ample allowance for their versatility of intellectual outlook and employed it strikingly to show how each contributes to the Greek theological tradition in his own specific manner. Each thinker is handled as an individual problem and each emerges as a vital and even colorful seeker after truth. There can be no doubt that this study has long been needed and will long endure, since the theological background of Plato and Aristotle, when it has not been left in the dark, has so often been illuminated in a fitful and even deceptive manner. This is a comprehensive synthesis and penetrating interpretation of the available material on theology as it was understood by the early Greeks, and the author makes a very convincing argument that this theological thinking is a native characteristic of the Greek intellect and has been bequeathed by it as a heritage to future ages. A word should be said about the presentation; it is uniformly excellent and never for a paragraph becomes monotonous. Not one of the least features of the book is the author's ability to write notes that are not only scholarly, which we take for granted, but so in teresting and stimulating that they may be accepted as a model for this kind of book.
