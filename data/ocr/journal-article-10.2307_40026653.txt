<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers: the construction of equality in the Late Dorset period T. Max Friesen Abstract Around 1000 years ago, the eastern North American Arctic was occupied by people known to archaeologists as Late Dorset, who exhibited a high degree of sedentism, reliance on storage and in some regions a relatively high population density. At the same time, the Late Dorset archaeological record has yielded evidence for a well-developed artistic tradition, construction of elaborate communal structures in many regions and a widespread trade network. This package of traits is often associated with inegalitarian 'complex hunter-gatherers', a category represented in its most extreme form by recent First Nations of the Northwest Coast of North America. In the Late Dorset case, however, a number of attributes appear to be more consistent with egalitarian social relations. Most importantly, prominent communal structures in many Late Dorset regions known as 'longhouses' and 'hearth rows' are best interpreted as overt symbols of equality and homogeneity among Late Dorset individuals and groups. In attempting to understand why Late Dorset groups would invest so much labour in reinforcing a message of equality, a key contrast can be seen between the 'core' of the Late Dorset world, in Foxe Basin, and other regions to the west, north and east. The core does not contain longhouses and hearth rows, but does contain apparently high population densities and at least the beginning of a tradition of formal burials; in other regions, population densities are probably lower, longhouses and hearth rows are ubiquitous and burials are virtually unknown. Thus, the prominent egalitarian symbols in peripheral regions may have developed not simply as a reflection of existing social relations, but rather as a form of resistance to, or masking of, increasing social complexity in Late Dorset society as a whole.

Although each society is unique, and can be seen as the confluence of an almost infinite number of historical and environmental factors which are at least nominally independent, some general patterns do exist which guide thought on hunter- gatherer lifeways. Perhaps most prominent in recent decades is the study of hunter- gatherer 'complexity', which is generally taken to refer to societies with some degree of stable social ranking, hierarchy or inequality (see overviews in Arnold 1996; Fitzhugh 2003; Price and Brown 1985; Sassaman 2004). Hunter-gatherer complexity tends to correlate with, and has often been explained by the presence of, reliable and concentrated food sources, storage, sedentism, high population densities and territorial circumscription. What might be termed 'secondary' correlates include elaborate trade networks, highly developed representational 'art' and an emphasis on burials often including permanent cemeteries. In this paper, I will discuss the case of the Late Dorset, who inhabited the eastern North American Arctic from approximately 500 to 1300 AD. For the Late Dorset, many of the pre-conditions for hunter-gatherer 'complexity' existed, such as a high degree of sedentism, reliance on storage and in at least some regions a relatively high population density. At the same time, the Late Dorset archaeological record is rich in many categories of information often associated with complexity, such as a well-developed artistic tradition, construction of elaborate communal structures and a widespread trade network. However, I will argue that as a whole Late Dorset society can be seen as one in which active efforts were made to reinforce an egalitarian, non-hierarchical world-view. This contradiction may provide a window onto otherwise obscure aspects of Dorset social organization. Hunter-gatherer social organization: egalitarian, hierarchical and points in between Most theory applied to the archaeological record of hunter-gatherers is ultimately based on the ethnographic record, with recent overviews emphasizing variability in virtually all aspects of society. In this paper, I will briefly explore the relationship between two particularly important dimensions along which hunter-gatherer societies vary: subsistence- settlement organization and degree of social hierarchy. This will be achieved by outlining two ideal extremes of hunter-gatherer social structure: complex and egalitarian, and linking them to the conditions thought to be necessary for their existence. This discussion will provide context for the interpretation of a unique combination of these factors found in Late Dorset society in the eastern Arctic. At one end of an idealized continuum are 'complex' hunter-gatherers, for which I take the narrow social definition: they exhibit some level of formal, ascribed hierarchy in which specific individuals or groups (e.g. households or lineages) have privileged access to power, prestige and the necessities of life (Layton 1986; Price 2002; Sassaman 2004). Well-known ethnographic examples include many North American Northwest Coast First Nations (e.g. Ames and Maschner 1999; Coupland 1998; Matson and Coupland 1995), the Chumash of California (Arnold 1992; King 1990) and the Calusa of Florida (MacMahon and Marquardt 2004). These societies had formal leaders whose positions were inherited within lineages of differential status, often with an elite class, and in the case of at least</page><page sequence="3">196 T. Max Friesen some groups on the Northwest Coast, slaves (Donald 1997). Elites reinforced their status through ideology ultimately originating in a shamanistic world-view and symbolized by personal adornment seen in clothing, ornaments or body modifications such as tattoos, labrets or cranial deformation (e.g. Cybulski 1993). Trade was usually highly developed, and controlled by elites who displayed and redistributed exotic materials to reinforce their status (Hayden and Schulting 1997). Representational 'art' was often elaborate and used to reflect or reinforce social divisions; for example, the elaborate art styles of the Northwest Coast, including 'totem poles', masks used in rituals and labour-intensive anthropomorphic or zoomorphic stone bowls, appear to have developed in tandem with increasing status differences (Ames and Maschner 1999). Dwellings were often variable, with larger or more elaborate houses occupied by higher-status households (Donald and Mitchell 1975). Finally, these societies tended to have well-developed burial practices, sometimes incorporating cemeteries with separate areas for different lineages and differential treatment of higher status individuals in terms of grave goods, grave size and other features (e.g. Gamble et al. 2001). Complex hunter-gatherers are generally associated with a package of other phenomena associated with subsistence, settlement patterns and demographic factors. They exist in regions with abundant and reliable resources capable of sustaining relatively large human populations, and are associated with 'delayed return' economies (Woodburn 1982) in which resources are acquired during relatively brief periods and then stored for later use. In fact, storage is a major part of almost all complex hunter-gatherer economies. Elaborate technologies are often also required to acquire and process key resources in these systems. These societies are also generally sedentary, that is, they have a low level of residential mobility (in which entire communities or households move), often compensated for by some degree of logistic mobility (in which specialized task groups acquire resources at some distance for transport back to the main residential base: Binford 1980). At the other end of the social continuum are hunter-gatherers who exhibit a fully 'egalitarian' world-view and organization, well articulated by the idea of a 'foraging mode of production' (Leacock and Lee 1982; Crothers and Bernbeck 2004). For egalitarian hunter-gatherers, as represented by, for example, the !Kung (e.g. Lee 1979) and Hadza (e.g. Woodburn 1970), all individuals of the same age and gender are nominally 'equal'. Leadership is weakly developed or informal, and where present is based on ability (as in a successful hunter exerting some authority in decision-making surrounding hunting), and is not stable or ascribed. Sharing is emphasized, and equality is enforced through mechanisms such as ridicule of successful people and 'demand sharing' in which 'haves' must share with 'have-nots' (e.g. Lee 1982; Peterson 1993). Social cohesion is maintained through partnerships, bilateral kin ties and frequent visiting and interaction between regional groups. Social mobility and inter-group communication are emphasized, allowing relatively easy movement by individuals or families between groups. Finally, while representation in terms of art, music, dance and oral tradition is often elaborate, access to that representation is usually not restricted, except by sex and age class. Egalitarian hunter-gatherers thus defined can, in a general sense, be associated with circumstances which are essentially opposite to those defined for complex hunter- gatherers. They tend to live at lower population densities, often due to their presence in more 'marginal' environments. Their economy is 'immediate return' (Woodburn 1982), in</page><page sequence="4">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 197 that resources are consumed shortly after they are acquired, and storage is rare or absent. Residential mobility is relatively high, with frequent moves of the entire social group when resources in the vicinity of a residential site are exhausted (see Binford 1980). The relationship between social forms, on the one hand, and environment, subsistence and settlement, on the other, is at least hypothetically clear in this scheme. For complex hunter-gatherers, higher population densities lead to social stresses which can be reduced or managed through a number of means including the institution of formal leadership (e.g. Friesen 1999; Johnson 1982). Storage allows and implies 'ownership' of resources which may earlier have been considered common property (Testart 1982). Once owned, resources can be manipulated, for example to incur debt or other social obligations (Hay den 1995). Territorial circumscription involving defence of key locations reduces the ability of individuals or groups to 'opt out' of local politics and join other, neighbouring groups (Kelly 1995). It also leads to the creation of cemeteries as means of both laying claim to territories and providing a concrete reflection of social order (Gamble et al. 2001). All of these factors together can lead to conditions in which ambitious individuals ('aggrandizers' in Hay den's (1995) terminology) may achieve higher status, which can eventually become institutionalized. At the other end of the continuum, egalitarian hunter-gatherers live at lower population densities, move around more frequently, maintain relatively 'open borders' with neighbours and have a reduced ability to accumulate stored food or other material goods. Under these conditions, aggrandizers simply do not have the means to persuade or coerce others to the extent that inequalities can become institutionalized. As must be apparent, this intentionally reductionist dichotomy between complex and egalitarian hunter-gatherers masks an overwhelming complexity inherent in any effort to understand hunter-gatherer social relations in the past. Many key issues remain unresolved and subject to debate; however, for present purposes I will raise one particular set of issues: the characterization and understanding of hunter-gatherers organized at intermediate points along the continuum from egalitarian to complex. This can be re- phrased as a series of questions which will guide this study. What combinations of economic and social formations occur in between the two poles? Is hierarchy inevitable given dense, sedentary 'delayed-return' populations or are there effective strategies which could allow these societies to stay relatively egalitarian? Under what conditions will societies become more, or less, hierarchical, given that this process should not be seen as unidirectional, leading only from egalitarian to complex (Rowley-Conwy 2001)? At these intermediate points, how tight is the relationship between the economic/subsistence/ settlement and social realms - to what degree do they co-vary or are they relatively independent (Keeley 1988, 1991)? And, finally, are there cases of mobile, small-scale hunter-gatherers with institutionalized hierarchies and, conversely, are there sedentary, storing, hunter-gatherers with fully egalitarian social relations? The case study developed below is linked to Wiessner's (2002) recent study of the Enga, a horticultural people of highland Papua New Guinea, which led her to assert that egalitarianism is not simply a traditional state or an absence of hierarchy, rather it is 'the outcome of complex institutions and ideologies created and maintained by cultural means which empower a coalition of the weaker to curb the strong' (2002: 235). Through a variety of mechanisms, including trade patterns and systems of kin relations, the Enga made active efforts to reduce the ability of individuals to obtain higher status. In a related</page><page sequence="5">198 T. Max Friesen vein, Keen (2006) has discussed variability in social organization in a range of Australian hunter-gatherer societies, concluding that environmental constraints placed limits on the degree to which social hierarchies could develop, particularly as they relate to reproductive power of older men. These two studies are based primarily on the ethnographic record, and their translation to the archaeological record remains a significant challenge, given the vagaries of archaeological preservation and the lack of direct material correlates for many phenomena discussed within them. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that in prehistory a much greater variety of societies living in a broader range of natural and social environments existed than are known from the ethnographic record. In the case outlined below, I will present archaeological evidence which is consistent with an overt attempt to impose and/or reinforce an egalitarian ideology in an Arctic hunter-gatherer society. In other words, not only does this case show an absence of evidence for hierarchy, it shows the presence of direct material manifestations of egalitarianism. The Late Dorset period: an overview The prehistory of the eastern Arctic incorporates two archaeological traditions: Palaeo- Eskimo, which lasted from approximately 2500 cal. BC to 1300 cal. AD, and Inuit, representing groups which migrated eastward from Alaska around 1200 cal. AD, replacing the Palaeo-Eskimos (Maxwell 1985; McGhee 1996). The earliest Palaeo-Eskimos, known as Pre-Dorset, Independence I and Saqqaq, arrived in the eastern Arctic around 2500 cal. BC, and their material remains indicate a very sparse and mobile population which peopled most of the Canadian Arctic, Greenland and Labrador. Around 800-500 cal. BC, a transition occurred in which technologies changed, semi-subterranean houses were introduced, midden accumulation increased in some regions and larger sites were created; this new entity is known as Dorset. Dorset culture developed through Early and Middle stages, culminating in Late Dorset which appeared around 500 cal. AD in a process which is still poorly understood. These major developments occurred in situ in the eastern Arctic, although not all areas were occupied for the full duration. Rather, some areas, such as the High Arctic, Greenland, Newfoundland and the western Arctic Archipelago may have been periodically depopulated or abandoned, after which further waves of migration expanded into these areas. Late Dorset is known from most of the eastern Arctic, from Victoria Island in the west to northern Labrador in the east and from the northern coasts of Hudson Bay in the south to Ellesmere Island and north-western Greenland in the North (Fig. 1). Despite this great expanse, Late Dorset society probably arose in what has been referred to as the 'core area' of the eastern Arctic, which is centred on Foxe Basin but which during many periods can be considered to include adjacent regions of northern Baffin Island and Hudson Strait. The core area concept became formalized in the 1970s (e.g. Maxwell 1976; McGhee 1976), and has since received criticism on several grounds, including the lack of adequate published data from the core (Hood 1998) and the fact that during some periods other regions may have seen large populations and technological innovations which would be consistent with them being considered to have a 'core' status (Fitzhugh 1997). However, despite these issues, I accept the core area concept as useful, and it seems clear that for</page><page sequence="6">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 199 Figure 1 Map of the eastern North American Arctic, indicating extent of Late Dorset settlement and important places named in text. The Late Dorset 'core area' is centred on Foxe Basin. Site names are as follows: 1) Cadfael; 2) Igloolik Island; 3) Alarnerk; 4) David; 5) Kap Sankt Jacques; 6) Phillip's Garden, Port au Choix. most, if not all, of the Palaeo-Eskimo period, and especially the Dorset period, this region had relatively large and stable populations, as measured by site sizes and relatively continuous cultural sequences. This does not necessarily mean that individual sites were occupied for the entire Dorset period, but that the region as a whole always had a large population (e.g. Mary-Rousseliere 2002; Maxwell 1985; Meldgaard 1960a, 1960b. 1962; Murray 1996). This is particularly true in the Late Dorset, when there appears to be a peak in population (e.g. Rowley and Rowley 1997; Lynnerup et al. 2003). This core status clearly results from the confluence of many key resources in the region, with walrus and seals in particular being focal species in regional Dorset economies (Murray 1999).</page><page sequence="7">200 T. Max Friesen Late Dorset society, then, arose around 500 cal. AD, probably in the core area. However, the spread of Late Dorset people to other areas of the Arctic occurred later, and dates from far to the west on Victoria Island (Friesen 2004), north on Ellesmere Island and in north-west Greenland (Appelt and Gullov 1999; Schledermann 1990) and east in northern Labrador (Cox 2003) indicate that there may have been a rapid Late Dorset diaspora, occurring over a brief period centred on the second half of the eighth century cal. AD, into regions which had in many cases been abandoned by Early or Middle Dorset people centuries earlier. The Late Dorset period ends in most regions by approximately 1300 cal. AD, although the timing and causes of its demise are controversial topics (e.g. Appelt and Gullov 1999; Friesen 2004; McGhee 1997; Park 1993, 2000). What is clear, though, is that Late Dorset were replaced by Thule Inuit from Alaska, who are the direct ancestors of all modern Inuit in the eastern Arctic. In the following, I will briefly summarize the Late Dorset archaeological record, emphasizing aspects which make it unique and which relate to social organization. Occasionally, I will draw on Early or Middle Dorset examples where relevant. The Late Dorset economy was based on virtually all available food sources in the eastern Arctic, with the probable exception of bowhead whales. Aquatic mammals, such as walrus, ringed seal, bearded seal and harp seal; terrestrial mammals, such as caribou, muskoxen, Arctic hare, and fox; migratory and permanently resident bird species, including ducks, geese and ptarmigan; and fish, such as Arctic char and lake trout, all appear in Late Dorset house or midden contexts (e.g. Damkjar 2005; Darwent 2001; Maxwell 1985; Murray 1996). However, each region saw a different emphasis with a focus on locally abundant taxa. The subsistence economy varied significantly by season, with summer occupations often relying more on migratory birds, fish and caribou and winter on other taxa, such as seals or walrus available at breathing holes or polynyas (localized areas in which sea ice does not form, leading to concentrations of important resources). Importantly, many of these resources were available for relatively brief periods, and storage is clearly important to the Dorset economy. Murray (1999) has shown that storage caches are much more common in Dorset than earlier Pre-Dorset sites in Foxe Basin, and Dorset settlement patterns throughout the Arctic include significant numbers of caches. Caches, along with many other feature types, are probably under-represented in the published record because many Dorset sites were re-occupied by Thule Inuit, who destroyed, re-worked or re-used pre-existing Dorset structures. Throughout the Dorset period, semi-subterranean houses are relatively common, often with significant midden formation (e.g. Renouf 2003; Ryan 2003; Sutherland 2003). This is clear evidence for an increase in sedentism relative to their Pre-Dorset predecessors. 'Lighter' dwellings such as tent rings were used during the warm season, and it is likely that snow houses were used in at least some regions during parts of the winter. A particularly spectacular category of structure built only in the Late Dorset period consists of 'longhouses', which are linear outlines of boulders or gravel berms whose exterior dimensions are always around 5-7m in width, but vary from 8 to 45m in length (Damkjar 2000, 2005) (Plate 1). There is variability in longhouse construction, with, for example, longhouses in Ungava being semi-subterranean and outlined by gravel berms (Plumet 1985) and at least one very elaborate example at the David site in north-western Greenland which includes a complex axial feature running down its midline (Appelt and</page><page sequence="8">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 201 Plate 1 Longhouse 2 at the Cadfael site, Victoria Island, Nunavut. A: aerial view of the 38-metre long longhouse. Note internal walls, which are interpreted to represent two episodes of 'shortening' of this longhouse. B: interior of longhouse facing north. A 1 x lm test pit has been excavated along the east wall of the structure. Gull0v 1999; Gullov and Appelt 2001). This variability, combined with the fact that some longhouses were rebuilt several times, leads to uncertainty regarding many aspects of their form and use, including the nature of their roofs. However, it seems very likely that most, if not all, were originally roofed in some manner and actually occupied by Late Dorset groups, for three primary reasons: 1) a number contain ephemeral features interpreted as the remains of tents or partitioned living areas in their interiors (e.g. Plumet 1985; Schledermann 1996); 2) many longhouse sites do not contain other dwellings nearby and</page><page sequence="9">202 T. Max Friesen therefore the longhouses themselves appear to be the only possible structures in which people might have lived (e.g. Damkjar 2000); and 3) many longhouses contain a broad array of artefacts, and in some cases thin middens are found adjacent to them, often just outside one or both ends (Damkjar 2005). Therefore, the most likely scenario is that most longhouses originally housed multiple tents, probably with one for each family, although we cannot rule out the possibility that some had more continuous roofs created by joining individual family tents, or that in some cases individual longhouses were reworked into a form which did not incorporate a roof. Longhouse sites also usually contain other features including caches, and in many cases 'hearth rows', which are rows of identical features probably used in food preparation. Animal bones from these sites confirm that they were occupied during the summer (Damkjar 2000, 2005). In sum, the Late Dorset settlement pattern can be summarized as one which is regionally variable, but in most areas included relatively sedentary occupations at fall/winter sites with occupation of semi-subterranean houses and, in some cases, snow houses. Other seasons saw the use of tents, and major summer aggregations occurred in most regions at longhouse sites, although it is not clear whether these were annual events or occurred less frequently. Significant departures from this pattern occur in the densely populated Foxe Basin region, where longhouses do not occur, and in Ungava, where semi-subterranean longhouses may indicate longer occupation each year and/or occupation during a colder season. Late Dorset demography is difficult to reconstruct, due to insufficient survey and excavation, and to problems of site contemporaneity in which it is not clear how many dwellings on a particular site were occupied simultaneously. It is clear, though, that patterns varied regionally and seasonally. For most of the Arctic outside the core, the largest aggregations appear to have occurred during the summer at longhouse sites. Here, the largest longhouse, at 45 metres in length, probably corresponded to an aggregation in the range of 100 people (Damkjar 2000; Schledermann 1996), although most other areas outside the core had smaller populations. In these same areas, cold-season sites, as indicated by the presence of semi-subterranean dwellings, were probably much smaller, with only a few houses occupied for local cold season populations of perhaps 10-30 (e.g. McGhee 1996; Schledermann 1990). In Foxe Basin, however, the situation is reversed. Some sites with semi-subterranean dwellings are very large, for example, at Alarnerk, eighty-seven houses can be confidently attributed to the Late Dorset period (Lynnerup et al. 2003), and on Igloolik Island the Late Dorset period sees one of several peaks in settlement density (Rowley and Rowley 1997). However, longhouses have not been found in Foxe Basin, probably the richest and most densely populated part of the core area, although they do occur on the outer edges of what is considered the core on Bylot Island, south-eastern Baffin Island and Ungava (Damkjar 2005). It is important to note that, in periods prior to the Late Dorset, other areas saw particularly large aggregations. In the Early Dorset period at the Kap Sankt Jacques site in north-eastern Greenland, a minimum of 274 dwellings indicates substantial aggregations, despite the fact that only a fraction would have been occupied at a single time (Appelt 2006; Gronnow and Jensen 2003). Likewise, during the Middle Dorset period at Port au Choix on Newfoundland, the very large Phillip's Garden site contained a minimum of sixty-eight semi-subterranean dwellings. Some of these houses were of a very large size and must have been intended to house particularly large numbers of people (Renouf 1999, 2006; Renouf and Murray</page><page sequence="10">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 203 1999). This large and rich site developed due to a unique location allowing optimal access to the huge annual harp seal migration (Hodgetts et al. 2003). Turning now to artefact assemblages, three aspects of Late Dorset material culture will be emphasized for present purposes. First, artefact form is extremely uniform over the entire geographic range of Late Dorset settlement (McGhee 1996). While some of this uniformity must result from the fact that all Late Dorset populations are derived from a single region, it also indicates continuous inter-regional communication. Second, although inter-regional exchange occurred throughout the Dorset sequence, in the Late Dorset period we see intensified exchange in a variety of materials including exotic lithic raw materials, copper, meteoritic iron, ivory and soapstone (e.g. McCartney and Mack 1973; Rowley and Rowley 1997; Schledermann 1996). Again, this is clear evidence for inter- regional interaction. Third, Dorset sites have produced large numbers of finely detailed representational carvings ('art') in ivory, antler, bone, wood and soapstone, and production of carvings increases substantially in the Late Dorset period (McGhee 1996; Sutherland 2001; Ta$on 1983; Taylor and Swinton 1967). Most are very small figures of animals or humans, often with suspension holes, while other categories include miniature harpoon heads, antler 'wands' covered in multiple human faces and obvious shamanic equipment such as full-sized wooden masks and carved animal teeth designed to fit in a human mouth. These carvings are relatively common, and most categories occur in a wide variety of contexts including longhouses, dwellings and middens. While the precise 'function' of the numerous small carvings may never be fully understood, their use as amulets seems plausible. Finally, a particularly noteworthy aspect of the Palaeo-Eskimo period as a whole is a near total lack of burials. In the Dorset period, despite its broad geographic extent and often excellent organic preservation, only a handful of human skeletons and isolated bones have been found, as summarized by Maxwell (1985; see also Helmer 1996; Lynnerup et al. 2003). However, in this extremely sparse record, two regions stand out as having more frequent and elaborate burials. First is the Port au Choix region in Newfoundland. Here, a number of graves have been found including at least two Middle Dorset cave burials located only a few kilometres from the major dwelling site of Phillip's Garden. These burials contain a minimum of eight and four individuals, respectively, including both adults and children, as well as a range of artefacts included as grave goods (Anderson and Tuck 1974; Harp and Hughes 1968). The second is the Foxe Basin region, where Meldgaard (1960b) reported a series of Dorset graves. Included in this number are several at Alarnerk, including one quite elaborate mound burial, and all graves with diagnostic artefacts are associated with the Late Dorset period (Lynnerup et al. 2003). Construction and maintenance of egalitarian social relations in Dorset society: longhouses and hearth rows The portrait of Late Dorset society painted above does not conform easily to the idealized dichotomies presented earlier which link environment, subsistence, settlement pattern, mobility and storage, on the one hand, with social organization, on the other. Dorset, and</page><page sequence="11">204 T. Max Friesen particularly Late Dorset, lived a relatively sedentary life, constructing substantial semi- subterranean houses in communities of varying size and storing large quantities of food obtained during seasonal peaks of availability. Population density varied, with longhouse aggregations probably indicating regional populations reached maxima of at least 100 individuals in some outlying areas, while in Foxe Basin, where we do not have longhouses, maximum aggregations may have been larger, and possibly more permanent as well. This is a virtual 'checklist' of conditions which can lead to the development of social hierarchies. However, in looking at more fine-grained evidence for the organization of Late Dorset society, social hierarchies are not directly indicated, and in fact much of the archaeological record can be read as reflecting egalitarian social relations. For the most part, the inference of egalitarian social relations results from a lack of clear indications of any hierarchy. For example, in cases where more than one house has been excavated at a site, and contemporaneity appears likely, houses tend to be of similar sizes, and generally do not have radically different frequencies of exotic artefacts which may indicate differential access to 'prestige'. Likewise, Late Dorset carvings are so common and widely distributed that they are consistent with relatively equal access to ideological power of at least some categories by all members of society. Of course, this does not necessarily apply to shaman's equipment and rare forms such as antler 'wands' - it is likely that some forms of ideological power were vested in individual shamans. Finally, elaborate cemeteries are a hallmark of complex and territorial hunter-gatherers, and their near absence in Late Dorset is consistent with an egalitarian social structure. While these observations are all in a sense 'passive' indicators of egalitarian social relations, one site type stands out as strongly reflective of active and overt efforts to signal equality: summer aggregation sites incorporating longhouses and hearth rows. Long- houses have recently received a great deal of attention as a window into Dorset culture. They clearly represent aggregations, generally occurring in the summer, although the Ungava semi-subterranean examples may represent longer and/or colder season occupations. The sites as a whole must have seen a complex and integrated combination of ideological (shamanic ritual, community ceremonies: e.g. Gullov and Appelt 2001), social (finding marriage partners, renewing alliances or partnerships: e.g. Schledermann 1990; McGhee 1996) and economic (acquiring locally abundant resources, trading: e.g. Damkjar 2005) activities. For this paper, however, my goal is to understand how these longhouses express Dorset social relations, especially as they relate to egalitarian vs. hierarchical organization. As an initial observation, it is clear that in all regions other than Foxe Basin, longhouse sites saw the largest aggregations, and must therefore have formed central hubs in tightly integrated networks of trade and information exchange, and a destination for individuals or groups travelling for any of these purposes. Therefore, these sites were centrally important in the production and reproduction of Dorset society - they took on a heightened role within the cultural landscape as a place where crucial messages were created and broadcast to those attending the aggregation, including members of the regional group and travellers from further away. These messages were amplified through what must have been elaborate ritual occurring during these aggregations, and complex symbolic associations for the longhouses and hearth rows themselves (e.g. Gullov and</page><page sequence="12">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 205 Appelt 2001; Plumet 1989). However, the centrally important aspect of these longhouses is the fact that large numbers of people, perhaps entire regional groups, lived and acted together within a symbolic boundary (e.g. Plumet 1985). In this connection, longhouses may have represented an extended version of a standard Dorset dwelling (Friesen 2000; Gullov and Appelt 2001; LeMoine 2003; Plumet 1989). Dwellings are a primary symbol of the family, which represents a group of closely related and interconnected people bound by ties of mutual aid and responsibility. The longhouse, therefore, would have extended this symbol to the entire regional group, and perhaps also to visitors from other regions, even though not all of these individuals would necessarily have been closely related kin. Thus, longhouses served as powerful symbols of a homogeneous, interconnected society. The impressive size of the walls of many longhouses, often incorporating huge boulders, is far more than would be required for any functional purpose. Therefore, in the act of building the longhouses, participants in these aggregations were shouting, not whispering, their message. The hearth rows, on the other hand, are quite different (Plate 2). They are not single enclosed spaces, but rather open-ended sets of closely identical structures. Individual hearths which make up the hearth rows might be small rectangular box-hearth- like depressions surrounded by stones, large amorphous circular concentrations of stones or a third form consisting of a flat slab with one or more larger stones on each of two opposite sides. This latter form probably supported a pot, skin bag or other piece of equipment (Schledermann 1996), and for present purposes will be referred to as a 'container support'. The function of each hearth type is difficult to determine; while food preparation is likely, there are very few bones, artefacts or signs of burning in most hearths, probably resulting from the use of many hearth rows on only a single occasion. Rows are either single or double, with double rows containing parallel rows each with a different type of hearth. For example, in a double row one row might contain box hearths while the other contains container supports. Where well-preserved, double rows contain 'pairs', that is, there are precisely equal numbers of the two types of hearth. Hearth rows typically contain between four and twenty-eight units, or pairs in the case of double rows (Damkjar 2000), each one probably representing a single family attending the aggregation. The most striking aspect of these hearth rows, and the key to their interpretation, lies in the fact that there is great variability between hearth rows, but within each hearth row each individual hearth is virtually identical in form and size. It is clear that the builders took great pains to create precisely equal features. As one example, the Cadfael site on southern Victoria Island contains four longhouses, ranging from 17m to 43m in length, and twenty- four hearth rows including eight double rows. The hearth rows are highly variable; however, within each row hearths are nearly identical, the clearest indication of this being in the orientation of rows containing container supports. In some rows, the orientation of the two upright stones in each container support is parallel to the row, while in others the orientation is perpendicular to the row, but in no case does a row contain a 'mix' of orientations. Presumably, the actual construction of a hearth row must have been significant, or they would be re-used, and there would be no need to construct multiple hearth rows on a single site. I suspect that, as the row was built, each individual or family copied the preceding hearths as closely as possible - exact equivalence in form was in many</page><page sequence="13">206 T.

Given that each hearth almost certainly represented one family, it seems clear that the hearths were meant as direct material symbols of equality and homogeneity between families. In sum, while longhouse site aggregations must have had multiple purposes and been the location for a great range of activities, at their core was a major effort to reinforce the notion of Late Dorset society as egalitarian, homogeneous and interdependent.</page><page sequence="14">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 207 Egalitarian social relations were not passively constituted; rather, a great deal of energy was expended to make them the central message to be received by all who participated in the aggregation. Implications for Late Dorset social organization Clearly, Late Dorset society exhibited most of the characteristics which can lead to the development of social hierarchies. They were at least seasonally sedentary, relied on storage and in some regions had access to dense, dependable resource concentrations which allowed high population densities (at least by Palaeo-Eskimo standards). However, the archaeological record left behind is for the most part consistent with egalitarian social relations, and, in the spectacular case of summer aggregation sites incorporating longhouses and hearth rows, a major effort was made to reinforce egalitarian social relations. The key question then becomes, if Late Dorset were fully egalitarian, why would they need to expend such major physical, social and ideological efforts to reinforce this central structuring principle? In a break from most previous interpretations, including my own (Friesen 2000), I propose that this evidence for overt signalling of equality may indicate the presence of the exact opposite: longhouses and hearth rows may have been constructed as acts of resistance to a growing tendency towards inequality or incipient hierarchies in Late Dorset society. This idea can be developed further by returning to the idea of Foxe Basin as the core of the Late Dorset world, with particularly dense and sedentary populations. In the Late Dorset period, real differences may have existed between regions, with the core effectively coming closer to a critical mass of factors which could allow the development of hierarchies. Here, we have particularly dense and reliable resource accumulations (Maxwell 1985; Murray 1999), large sites, most spectacularly represented by Alarnerk (Lynnerup et al. 2003), and aggregations are probably more permanent. Furthermore, in a clear and telling development within the Palaeo-Eskimo sequence, a variety of burials have been reported here, including at least one elaborate example (Lynnerup et al. 2003). Finally, Murray (1996) has identified what are almost certainly ownership marks on harpoon heads from Igloolik Island in Foxe Basin, and has convincingly argued that they would have been used by hunters to establish ownership of game, especially walrus, a practice consistent with elaboration of social complexity. These marks occur throughout the Dorset sequence, but are present in the highest proportions during the Late Dorset period. Thus, Foxe Basin contains both the conditions under which ambitious individuals ('aggrandizers') could try to achieve more power over others, and several data classes indicating that social change was occurring in the direction of increasing complexity. Importantly, this same confluence of factors does not appear in the Late Dorset archaeological record in other regions. However, the Foxe Basin core is also the one major region where longhouses and hearth rows do not occur, despite their presence in virtually all other regions inhabited by Late Dorset people (Damkjar 2005). Murray (1999) has commented on this fact, hypothesizing that longhouses and hearth rows in peripheral areas represent attempts by Late Dorset people to emulate their more fortunate counterparts in the core. However, according to</page><page sequence="15">208 T. Max Fries en the model outlined here, the opposite is the case: longhouses and hearth rows were built in outlying regions as a reaction to, or in opposition to, incipient or actual social hierarchies developing in the core area. Based on exchange patterns of exotic materials, and the close similarities in artefact form throughout the Late Dorset world, it is clear that the peripheries maintained active communications with the core, so incipient or real status hierarchies, elaboration of burials, ownership of resources and other phenomena developing in the core would have been well known to people on the periphery. Perhaps there were even occasional attempts by individuals on the periphery to imitate social developments in the core. Reactions to these tendencies must have been complex and varied. However, the most visible one was resistance: the construction of longhouses and hearth rows as prominent symbols of an egalitarian world-view which would have represented opposition to the example of their neighbours. Once raised, the possibility that social inequalities developed in the core provides a novel perspective on Late Dorset archaeology. Longhouses and hearth rows have already been mentioned in this connection; perhaps many of the other phenomena which make Late Dorset unique can also be explained by this model. For example, the increased frequency of artistic production in the Late Dorset period is often attributed to external stress, brought about either by climate change or interaction with aggressive Thule Inuit newcomers (e.g. McGhee 1996; Ta^on 1983). However, if inequalities were developing in Late Dorset, then the associated internally generated stress could be implicated instead, with 'art' somehow mediating social tensions. Similarly, the intensive exchange of metal, ivory and lithic raw materials may have been at least in part driven by individuals or groups seeking to enhance their prestige. Another remarkable feature of the Late Dorset period is the rapid peopling of a huge area in the eastern Arctic by Late Dorset over a short period during the eighth century AD. We currently have no certain explanation for this diaspora, although it is often considered to result from the changing climate of the Medieval Warm Period. The present model suggests an alternative: some Late Dorset groups may have moved out of their core 'homeland' because social developments there produced enough tension to lead individuals and collectives to 'vote with their feet' and leave, in order to avoid participation in actual or incipient hierarchical social structures. Alternatively, the migration could have been initiated by status-seeking individuals whose ambitions could not be satisfied in the core. Regrettably, none of these suggestions can be fully evaluated based on currently available evidence; however, they are eminently testable on the basis of future survey and excavation. Discussion These interpretations of Late Dorset social structures have a number of implications for Arctic archaeology and for more general studies of hunter-gatherers. In an Arctic context, this suggests a reorientation for Dorset Archaeology: the search for evidence of at least incipient social 'complexity' and its impact on Dorset cultural development at both the local and regional levels and at both short-term and long-term time scales. Of course, we should not expect to find full-blown 'hunter-gatherer complexity' of the sort seen on</page><page sequence="16">Hearth rows, hierarchies and Arctic hunter-gatherers 209 the Northwest Coast. Palaeo-Eskimo histories and Arctic environmental conditions were unique, and would lead to unique social solutions. The idea of history is crucial here: Palaeo-Eskimo culture developed in relative isolation from a base of very small-scale, mobile and almost certainly egalitarian societies which first populated the eastern Arctic during the third millennium cal. BC. This must have conditioned both the form of 'complexity' it developed, and perhaps also the nature of resistance to any tendencies towards emerging inequalities. This development within pre-existing social structures can be seen, for example, in the fact that longhouses may have represented symbolic expansions of pre-existing Dorset house forms. Likewise, the nature of the Arctic environment must have imposed constraints on the development of inequalities, albeit in a regionally variable fashion (cf. Keen 2006). Thus, we should look for unique social forms in Late Dorset, and should probably expect to find tendencies toward social change in the direction of hierarchy, rather than fully developed hierarchies. These interpretations lead to a series of questions. If hierarchies developed, were they most pronounced in the core area? Can the roots of this development be seen earlier in the Dorset period - for example, is the 'transition' from Pre-Dorset to Dorset only a development in economy, technology and settlement pattern, as usually portrayed, or might it also represent the roots of social change in the Palaeo- Eskimo record? Were there instances earlier in Dorset prehistory where similar processes occurred? For example, in the Middle Dorset occupations at Port au Choix, where we have dependable resources, large populations, large houses and the appearance of burials, do we see a similar, independent process or something quite different? To resolve these questions for Late Dorset, we need large-scale excavations of multiple, contemporaneous houses at individual sites, in order to recover patterns of inter- household differentiation in access to prestige and power, as potentially visible in phenomena such as house size and frequencies of exchanged exotic materials. This is especially true for Foxe Basin, and another corollary of this model is that the 'core area concept' is in fact still valid, especially for the Late Dorset period. Perhaps most significantly, if this explanation holds up, the trajectory of major developments in Late Dorset society would be seen to result largely from internally generated social tensions or contradictions, rather than the external environmental explanations usually deployed in Arctic prehistory. In more general terms, this paper provides a case study of a hunter-gatherer society organized in a manner predicted by the ethnographic record but not yet fully demonstrated in the archaeological record: hunter-gatherers living a sedentary existence consistent with the development of 'complexity', but whose social organization indicates an active effort to reinforce an egalitarian world view. The Late Dorset pattern, as interpreted here, is unique, although other related examples exist of prehistoric hunter- gatherers who are clearly sedentary, densely populated and with intensified economies, but have been interpreted as having no clear evidence for status hierarchies (e.g. Middle Jomon in Japan: Habu 2002; Natufian in the Levant: Bar-Yosef 2002). The Late Dorset example suggests that it is in the initial stages of developing inequalities that we might see resistance, in this case in the form of overt egalitarian messages carried in communal structures at aggregation sites. Alternatively, it might be in these initial stages that emerging elites go to the greatest efforts to mask incipient inequalities (Hay den 1995).</page><page sequence="17">210 T. Max Friesen Perhaps we should not expect to see such clear indications of an overtly egalitarian ideology in cases of 'immediate return' societies, since they may not need to expend as much effort reinforcing equality given an absence of storage, sedentism and their correlates. Instead, and in some senses counter-intuitively, the appearance of overt symbols of equality in the archaeological record may in fact indicate the exact opposite: the presence, or at least incipient development of, status hierarchies.
