<plain_text><page sequence="1">Songs Of Innocence And Volkswagens Geoff Nicholson Is The Book of Volkswagens and Forgetting W JL JLe JL JLe is dreaming. It is an erotic dream of sorts. It happens. The bombs go off. The car is blown apart from within. It is all slow-mo and freeze frame, a carnival of special effects, brightness dancing and hanging in space, shimmering, spinning tinsel, particles that curl and leapfrog, fragments of vehicle that shuffle and reshuffle, furling and unfurling in the dented air; electrical components, shards of glass, slices and slithers of upholstery, tatters of fabric and machine. It is all fallout. There is a great leveling, a loss of organisation, a bringing down to size. He stirs. He wakes up. He is not sure who he is. He is not not sure who is the owner of the dream. 2: Six Volkswagens in Search of an Author Carlton Hart, a scion of the Hart property and banking dynasty has successfully turned himself into one of England's, if not the world's, foremost Volkswagen collectors. He is a man of middle years but he still likes to think of himself as something of playboy. Certainly devoting his life to the Volkswagen seems pleasingly boyish and irresponsible, but that doesn't mean it isn't serious. He wakes early in the bedroom of his London house, a place he always refers to as his 'gentleman's residence'. The room is dark. He doesn't know what time it is. He reaches out and turns on the bedside lamp. The lamp is in the shape of a Volkeswagen Beetle, is made of blue porcelain, and is surprisingly accurate in its detailing. He consults the bedside clock, also Beetle-shaped, and decides to get up. He goes into the bathroom, sits on the cold toilet seat, thumbs through a copy of the magazine Volkswagen Universe while he's waiting, a magazine that has recently featured an article about the Hart collection. When he's finished he pulls a flurry of toilet paper from its holder. This holder too is shaped like a Beetle, the rear half anyway; the axle between the rear wheels serving as a core to hold the toilet roll. That over with, he steps into the shower, turns on the water. The shower curtain is decorated with a pattern of primary-coloured Beetles that career down it as though it is a busy motorway without lane markings. He starts to soap himself with a brand new block of soap that is again, Beetle-shaped. Carlton Hart goes to his dressing room. As he walks along the connecting corridor he is pleasantly aware of the array of toy and model Beetles that line the walls, secure in their locked and illuminated display cabinets. He barely looks at them but their mere presence gives him a kick. All the great manufacturers are represented here, as well as all the minor and obscure ones. All the examples are in perfect condition, mint and boxed where appropriate, the die-cast and the tinplate, the rarities and the</page><page sequence="2">16 crt c V bß rt Ž C/Ì "o &gt; 13 £ bO G O *§ o õ -fi u Z promotionals and the one-offs, the mass produced and the craftsman made. There are Beetles made of plastic and wood and glass and rubber, some fought for at auction, others sought out in obscure and surprising corners of the world, handmade in Nigeria or Egypt or Mexico. The collection spreads throughout the house. Many items are valuable beyond belief. Together they are priceless. Once dressed, he goes downstairs past the library with its unparalleled collection of Volkswagen books, histories, magazines and technical manuals. And he can't resist popping his head into the billiards room for the sheer pleasure of seeing the part of the collection that lives there. Around the walls of the panelled room, Volkswagen memorabilia is displayed like hunting trophies. Here are serried rows of hubcaps and steering wheels laid out to demonstrate changes in design and function. Likewise with speedometers and foot pedals, crankshafts and tail light assemblies, wing mirrors and distributor caps. There is a desk in the corner with Beetle stationery, a Beetle ruler, a Beetle sellotape dispenser, a Beetle stapler, a Beetle pencil sharpener and a Beetle rubber. There is a small model of a Beetle set in a cube of clear plastic to act as a paperweight. There are badges of a hundred or more Volkswagen owners clubs from all around the world. Finally there are posters, postcards, stickers, calendars, sales brochures, caps, shoulder bags; the works. Now it is time for breakfast, he prepares himself a boiled egg. When it's had its three and a half minutes he puts it into a shiny black Beetle egg cup, then adds salt and pepper from Beetle-shaped shakers. He pours coffee from a Beetle-shaped coffee pot, and drinks it out of a mug with a design proclaiming 'Fifty Years of the Beetle'. He lights a cigarette with his Beetle lighter, flicks ash into a Beetle ashtray. He feels in his pocket to confirm that his car keys are there, dangling from an enamal Beetle-shaped key fob. Ready now, he leaves his house, trots down the steps from the front door, and goes out to the garage. Actually there are two garages. One is a long, low building at the rear of the house converted from a former stable block. It contains ten or so Beetles, and as such is hardly in itself the home of a major collection, but Carlton has made sure that these few cars are very, very special. There is a 1937 Series 30 prototype, conceived so early in the Beetle's development that it doesn't even have a rear window. There's a Rometsch- built taxi, one of the few Beetles ever to be made with four doors. Here is a Hebmuller convertible used by the Munich fire department in the 1950s. There's a military Kübelwagen, as used by Hitler's troops in the Second World War. Here are a couple of immaculate and completely original split- windows. There's a Beetle-based 4stretch-limo', made by welding a couple of extra 'middles' into an ordinary saloon. Here's a cream and grey, lowered, louvred, dressed-up Cai look Beetle, so slick, so sexy, so shiny, so lacquered as to appear pornographic. Here is a state of the art, electric-blue Baja Beetle with its exposed engine and its stinger exhaust and its big knobbly tyres just waiting to eat up the desert. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Carlton Hart lets it be known that he has other garages in secret locations around the country, in Europe and even in America, as well as whole warehouses full of desirable Volkswagen goodies. Nor does he deny the existence of a famous, or infamous, locked room' somewhere in his house, a room that is reputed to contain</page><page sequence="3">memorabilia of such rarity and value as to be positively dangerous. Items that a man might kill or be killed for. 3: The Volkswagen Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors The first problem the police have with serial murders is determining what constitutes a series. Boy meets girl, boy gets her in his car, boy takes her to some lonely spot, beats her over the head, strips her, rapes her, mutilates her: so far so commonplace. Before police are prepared to admit that a serial killer is on the loose they want something a little more concrete, more decisive, a particular quirk, an idiosyncratic way of working, the fact perhaps that the murderer has a taste for handcuffs, has a savage way with a speculum, or even perhaps that he drives a Volkswagen Beetle. Here is Ted Bundy, comparatively early in his life of crime. He is an accomplished shoplifter, though in general he is fastidious about stealing only what he has use for. But today he is in a garden centre in Seattle, Washington and suddenly he gets an uncontrollable urge to steal an eight foot tall potted Germanica plant that is for sale and is positioned tantalisingly close to the exit. So he simply picks it up as though he owns it, walks out of the garden centre and heads for his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle. So far so good. But he's still got to stash the plant in his car and make his escape. How's he going to get an eight foot plant into a Volkswagen? Dead easy actually. The car's a 1968 model, the kind with the canvas sun roof that peels right back. He inserts the plant through the roof so that it rests in the passenger seat and Ted Bundy drives away unchallenged. It must have been an unusual sight, seeing this Volkswagen bowling along the freeway with three feet of Germanica foliage sticking out of the sun roof, but people who drive Bugs are the sort of people who do that kind of thing. Nobody bats an eyelid. 'Christ,' says Ted Bundy to himself, 'I love this car.' Here is Ted Bundy at Sammaville Beach in Seattle. It's a holiday afternoon and the place is crowded with people. He's dressed in sports clothes and he's got his arm in plaster. He cruises the beach, stopping girls from time to time with a line that goes something like, 'Hey babe would you help me lift my sailboat onto the roof of my Volkswagen? You can see I've injured my arm. How about it?' So they go to the car park. The Volkswagen's there but the boat isn't. 'Oh, I forgot to mention,' he says, 'my boat's up at my parents' house, just a few miles up the coast. Get in the car and I'll take you there.' Ted tries this line on a lot of girls. Most of them don't fall for it, but three do. Later they are raped, violated, murdered. And here is Ted Bundy in Utah in 1975. He has a dozen or so killings under his belt by now. He is stoned on marijuana and is driving his Volkswagen for the sheer hell of it, noticing how sharp and clear all the sounds and colours are tonight. And perhaps he's too stoned to notice that he's driving well over the speed limit, and too stoned to notice that there's a police car behind him. And perhaps he doesn't even see the red stop light that he drives through, but the officer in the car certainly does, and the siren starts sounding and there's a brief chase before Bundy is forced to come to a halt in a gas station. The officer gets Bundy out of the car and checks his ID, which appears to be in order. However, he looks into the car, sees there's no passenger 17 £ &lt;u bß a Ž Õ &gt; £ a C/3 bC £ O C/3 Ì2 o C/3 "o y Z</page><page sequence="4">18 C/5 G V be a Ź C/5 M "o &gt; -ö G a C/5 be G O "S o C/5 O -fi u 2 seat and that there's a jemmy lying on the floor. The officer calls for help. More police arrive. They search the car and find an ice pick, a mask made from silk stockings and a pair of handcuffs. Bundy is hauled in, and a more thorough investigation of the car's interior takes place. They gather up all the dirt and fibre and debris, and send it off for analysis. Eventually they will discover a human hair from the head of one of the murder victims, and, curled at the base of the gear lever, a pubic hair belonging to another dead girl. But all this takes time. Initially all they can charge Bundy with is the possession of tools that might be used in a burglary. Bundy is let out on bail. One of his first acts is to sell his Volkswagen. It must have broken his little heart. The police are gradually putting two and two together. With Bundy in the frame the police have the opportunity to see if there is evidence to link him to the murders. They find a girl who Bundy tried to lure to her death. She identifies him. The charge changes from possessing tools to aggravated kidnapping. Bundy is in trouble, the heat is closing in, but he is determined to go down in a blaze of blood, death and car theft. Here is Ted Bundy escaping from jail. Here he is hiding in the hills, stealing cars; a Cadillac, an MG, a Toyota, a Dodge van. Here is Ted Bundy the fugitive stalking the corridors of the Chi Omega sorority house, committing two more murders and numerous acts of brutal mutilation. It's the real thing for Ted, but it's not the same without a Volkswagen. In Tallahassee, Florida, he finally gets lucky. He's walking down the street looking for another car to steal and he comes across a Beetle with the keys inside. He gets in and drives a few miles. But the car is heavily customised all fancy body work and dressed up and chromed, and Ted, a Republican at heart, fears the modifications may have impaired the car's essential reliability. So he ditches it. And then he finds another Beetle. This is a stock 1972 model, painted orange. He decides it's the car for him, but it too turns out to be a clunker. If he drives over fifty miles an hour the wheels shake as though they're about to fall off, but he decides he'd better stick with it. It's real film noir stuff by now. He steals credit cards, tries to use them but they've already been reported stolen. He drives up a dirt road to lie low for a while and finds himself on an airforce base. He tries to steal handbags in a shopping mall and is bounced by the security guards. Finally the police recapture him, not because they recognise him as Ted Bundy the serial sex killer, but because he's at the wheel of a stolen Volkswagen. It's another ten years before they get to fry him. While on Death Row he receives a lot of mail. There are love letters, women who want to marry Ted Bundy, give him their love, have his children. There are packages containing all kinds of tokens both of love and hate. One contains a bottle of barbecue sauce for when Bundy is 'fried'. But the oddest of all comes from a man who bought Ted Bundy's cleaned and spruced-up Volkswagen after his first arrest. The writer of the letter says he hates Bundy and he'll never drive a Volkswagen again. He's had the car taken to the scrapyard, but he's kept the gear lever as a grim souvenir and now, for reasons he only dimly understands, he wants Bundy to have it back. Of course, the prison authorities never give Bundy the gear lever but it is</page><page sequence="5">often rumoured that it found its way into the collection of Carlton Hart, one of the items kept in the famous locked room. 4: My Volkswagen Wants to Kill Your Mama Here is Charles Manson living at the Spahn Movie Ranch; a permanent, though rundown, movie set in the style of a cowboy town. It consists of one main street, with the facades of a jail, a cafe, a funeral parlour. Occasionally the set is used by makers of TV commercials or moderately ambitious porn movies. The only things that look out of place here are half a dozen or so stolen Volkswagen dune buggies parked a little way off the main drag. Manson has moved his whole extended family here, and they receive a lot of company; mostly outlaw biker types who belong to chapters with catchy names like Satan's Slaves or the Straight Satans. Manson is free with his food and dope, and the girls in the family will do just about anything he tells them. Out here at the edge of the desert, Manson has decided that things are going to get fairly Apocalyptic before too long. Heiter Skelter is on its way. There'll be an armed uprising by the blacks, who will slaughter millions of white folks, take over America. Then they'll realise they've been damned fools, recognise that Charles Manson is both God and The Devil, and invite him to become their leader. In order to lie low during those years of conflict, Manson has arranged a hideout in Death Valley, at the Barker Ranch, but he needs a means of getting there when all Hell breaks loose. He used to favour old school buses as transport, but he knows that not any old vehicle will make it through the rough desert terrain to the hideout. He needs something special, namely a fleet of Volkswagen dune buggies. There are all sorts of practical reasons for choosing Volkswagens. They're rugged and reliable, and they're small enough to get through tight gorges and caverns where police vehicles can't follow. With special outsize gas tanks they'll have a range of thousand miles or so, and if the going gets really tough, they're light enough that two or three people can pick them up and carry them. Manson imagines a whole fleet of them, some loaded up with food, some with dangerous drugs, some with ammo. He sees them charging through the desert in V formation, himself at the front like Rommel, churning up the earth, a cloud of thick dust obliterating the world behind them. But there's more. Manson, not usually much of a reader, has been studying his Bible, and it's all in there, all this stuff about the significance of the dune buggy, right there in the Book of Revelation. The dune buggies are going to have breastplates of fire, in other words they're going to be horses of the Apocalypse, you dig? * * * Manson starts to live out more of his fantasies. He sets up a production line behind the Spahn Ranch, which he calls the Devil's Dune Buggy Shop. Volkswagens are stolen from town, taken to the ranch, stripped down, converted into vehicles of the Apocalyspse. Pride of the fleet is Manson's own Command Vehicle. It is one Hell of a dune buggy. It looks both futuristic and ancient. There is a 'magic sword' sheathed in the steering column, locks of human hair tied round the roll bar, a sleeping platform, armour plate, a machine gun mounting, a fur canopy. It has been recently resprayed, then desert sand thrown onto the 19 5/3 C V bC £ 5/3 *0 &gt; -o e a 5/3 bo C O o 5/3 "o u Z</page><page sequence="6">20 C/5 G v bC £ &amp; Õ &gt; C «S C/5 bo C O 'c o CA "o .fi u 2 paint while still wet, to form a kind of camouflage. When the whole shooting match is over, this Command Vehicle will be displayed at a car show in Pomona, California and get a lot of admiring attention from the custom Volkswagen fraternity. * * * It is July 15, 1969 and officer Breckenridge of the Los Angeles Sheriff office is making a routine helicopter patrol flight over the desert. He passes over the Spahn Movie Ranch and sees three Volkswagen floorpans lying around down there. It looks to him as though somebody is seriously into car theft and stripping down. He makes a note to take a closer look at ground level before too long. But a few stripped Volkswagen chassis out in the desert, well it hardly looks like the crime of the century. It will be a month before he organises a police raid, quite a hectic month for the Manson family, a month in which the Hinman-Tate-LaBianca murders will take place. * * * And here in the aftermath, when all the media have covered the murders, is Mrs McCann thinking about her missing daughter whom she knows was a member of the Manson family. To Manson, the daughter was known as Malibu Brenda and she was with him from the very beginning to the very end of the madness. Mostly Mrs McCann prefers not to think about all the things her daughter must have done while in that man's clutches. However, when Manson makes the cover of Life magazine, even she finds it hard not be interested. Her relationship with Brenda has always been a difficult one, but she tried to understand, to be, you know, permissive. She didn't even mind too much when Brenda stole her ocelot coat; after all, she might need it for those cold desert nights. But suddenly, here's Mrs McCann perusing Life magazine and there are pictures of Manson and the family and of the Manson Command Vehicle, and she sees with horror that the vehicle's canopy is made from the very fur coat that her daughter stole from her. She is speechless. Her heart suddenly hardens. There are some things, many things, you might forgive a daughter, but turning your best ocelot fur coat into a canopy for a dune buggy of the Apokalypse is surely not one of them. That same fur canopy is another of the relics that is supposedly to be found in Carlton Hart's locked room. 5: That Obscure Volkswagen of Desire Here, finally, is Adolf Hitler in the Spring of 1938 in a timber cabin in the woods of Bavaria. He is here to relax from the affairs of state. Eva Braun sits beside him on a Biedermeier love seat, sipping Apfelwein and nibbling Mohnstriezel. And here is Paul Loffler, one of German's finest, most inventive makers of clocks and automata, and one of Hitler's favourites. He is here to entertain the happy couple, to amuse and amaze them with his latest creation. In the past he has made cuckoo clocks out of which pop extinct or mythological creatures - cerebus, a gryphon, a dodo - or an automaton the size of a wedding cake on which lovingly hand-carved figures enact scene from Wagner's 'Ring", synchronised to music played on gramophone records.</page><page sequence="7">Loffler enters carrying a large carpet bag which he places on a small table in front of the Führer. He released the clasps and opens the neck of the bag before reaching in and producing what looks like a small model of a Volkswagen Beetle, though of course, he would not have known it by that name. It is carved from smooth, polished mahogany, with brass fittings for the hub caps, windscreen wipers, door handles and headlamps, and although it has a fabric sunroof, the windows are opaque* made of black glass. It is no more than a foot long. Loffler holds it out to Adolf Hitler who takes it from him and eyes it carefully. He does not smile. He can see that it is a well-made and skillfully executed model of the car, but somehow he had expected more from Loffler. Then he notices that there is a small brass winder protruding from the rear of the car, like a cranking handle, that just cries out to be turned, and Hitler duly turns it. Slowly and smoothly the sun roof rolls back to reveal the interior of the car. There are seats and a steering wheel and a metal gear lever and foot pedals, but there are also two small figures, a man and a woman sitting beside each other on the rear seat. they're carved from real human bone, ' Loffler says confidentially. Adolf Hitler peers at the two tiny figures. They are beautifully carved and they are articulated. They are able to move thanks to an intricate system of threads, wires and armatures, and as the handle turns, they begin to perform. But there is something disturbing about them. First, they are naked, a forgivable artistic licence perhaps since it shows off Loffler's carvings of muscles and flesh; but what seems unforgivable, what in the circumstances would have previously been considered unthinkable, in the fact that the two white figures have been given the faces of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. As Hitler continues to turn the handle, the female figure lowers her head towards the male figure's crotch where a penis, flatteringly out of scale and disproportionately large, rises towards her mouth. The two bone automata mime an act of vigorous fellatio until, in a sudden rapid conclusion, the female pulls back her head and a shower of sparkling powder - 'Genuine diamond dust,' Loffler explains - jets out of the automaton's penis and coats the face of the miniature Eva Braun. Instantly the sunroof springs back over the car and conceals the two figures. Again it looks like a harmless model of a KdF wagen. Paul Loffler looks exremely pleased with himself, but Adolf Hitler shows a more complex, more equivocal response. His face is not inert, rather it seems to be searching for an appropriate expression. Beneath the moustache, his lips twitch in an uncertain manner that Loffler certainly hopes will turn into an expression of uncontainable pleasure, and sure enough, at length, the Führer does allow his lips to bend into a thin, taut smile. Later that same day, Paul Loffler is taken out into the woods and, in a spot well screened from the cabin by a row of silver birches, he is shot by a Gestapo officer. The automaton disappears. Carlton Harťs life ambition is to find it again. 6: The Twilight of The Volkswagens The noise of twin carburetors and stinger exhausts screams across the sky. There is a curl of blue smoke, the smell of multigrade and four star and teen spirit, the sound of radiais on loose gravel. Here they come; a 21 C/5 c p bo a Ž C/Î "o &gt; TJ C CS) bo C O "c o c/5 o u z</page><page sequence="8">22 C/3 G V bo 03 £ C/3 O &gt; T3 C c/3 bC C O i: o C/3 O -fi u Z procession, a danse macabre, something stately and dangerous, new- fangled yet elemental. They come in different engine capacities and colours, with or without optional extras. Here they come, the heroes and the bad guys, the lovers and killers, the good, the bad, the winners and posers, the hippies and cops, the postmen, the surfers, the ravers; all driving Volkswagen Beetles, always crashing in the same car. Here are some Disney executives at the boardroom table having a brainstorming session, sometime in the late sixties. 'Hey it's freaky out there. Everybody's taking drugs, marching on the Pentagon, burning their draft cards. What we need is some mawkish sentimental crap for the family audience. And sure, we've made plenty of mawkish sentimental crap about wildlife and children, but hey, let's face it fellers, the times they are a changing. How about this for a concept? Let's make some mawkish sentimental crap about an anthropomorphic Volkswagen!!!!! Far out or what?' Here is Ralph Nader, pioneer of consumer safety, the man who nixed the Chevrolet Corvair, and he isn't at all happy about this Bug mania that's sweeping the country. They're strange and foreign and popular as Hell and it sure wouldn't do his profile any harm if he could prove they were rolling Germanic death traps. So he looks at them and drives them and take them apart and crashes them, and in the end all he can find to complain about is the fact that in the event of a serious collision, the petrol cap cover might, you know, fly off and hurt somebody. Here is Ivan Hurst the man who brought the Wolfsburg factory back to life after the allied conquest of Germany, the man who, more than anyone else was responsible for the post-war rebirth of the Volkswagen Beetle. It is 1989 and he is living in the village of Marsden in West Yorkshire, a Volkswagen Golf GTi on his garage, and a neighbour asks him is it true he used to work for Volkswagen. 'Well actually,' he says, 'Volkswagen rather used to work for me.' Here is Woody Allen with 'Sleeper' where a Volkswagen Beetle that hasn't been used for centuries still starts first time. And serious students of Allen will note that when Susan Anspach leaves him in 'Play it Again Sam' she too drives away in a Beetle. Here is Philip K. Dick in July 1964, driving a Volkswagen Bug; Philip K. Dick a man with a taste for Tri-Chevvies and Jags. Here he is, paranoid and speeding, seeing angels and devils, crazy as a hoot-owl in the opinion of his girlfriend, fearing he is being persecuted by the CIA and the FBI as well as by some nameless neo-Nazi organisation. He powers the Bug into a corner, completely misjudges its capacity for understeer, and he flips the car over. He has to wear a body cast and has his arm in a sling for the next two months. Even the Volkswagens are against him. Here is Liberace making a grand entrance in his new Las Vegas show. He drives on a stage in a mirrored Rolls Royce, but has a Volkswagen that is used solely to carry off stage his pink feathered cape. Here, on some New England campus in the mid nineteen-sixties are a whole bunch of young students engaged in the sport of 'jamming', in which they attempt to cram as many people as possible into a Beetle. Bodies press together, hands, faces and erogenous zones are brought into unlikely and intimate contact. It just wouldn't be the same in a Cadillac. Here at the guys at Doyle Dane Bernbach, the advertising agency that's</page><page sequence="9">S cp^iļ: ¿ 0-f- -L*«' ocelce- i/o / /Cf í^zt^evf o ^"V^i I^As^LÁ^Y^V^</page><page sequence="10">24 landed the account for Volkswagen in America. Thing is, some of these ^ guys are Jewish, and naturally they have a few qualms. Hey, they say, Adolf S Hitler was responsible for the Volkwagen. Adolf Hitler killed six million nP Jews. I'm a Jew.

Ž And where are they going, all these fellow travellers? What's the destination? Why, they're heading for the vanishing point, following the yellow brick road. They're driving towards Edge City, towards Valhalla, towards a new Albion and the darkness at the edge of town. Are you there Dean Moriarty? And here is the writer, here am I, writing this piece in a room full of Volkswagen books and Volkswagen clippings and Volkswagen models and Volkswagen memorabilia. I could pretend it's all just research material, but it's deeper and weirder than that. Here I am skimming through biographies and running through indexes. Did the Yorkshire Ripper drive a Volkswagen? Did Jeffrey Dahmer? And if they did then wow, that's another chapter I can write. Did Clint Eastwood drive a Beetle? Did Billy Connelly? Did Eddie Van Halen? Well yes, as a matter of fact they did, but what exactly can I do with that? And sometimes I ask myself 'Why a Beetle?' Sometimes I think I might have chosen some other familiar, cultish, man-made object. Why not the Luger or the Zippo Lighter or the Fender Strat. But that's another story, another obsession, another novel. Perhaps I am the owner of the dream. 7: The Volkswagen in Winter Carlton Hart leaves his house, but today he isn't going to the garage containing his wonderful rare Volkswagens. He goes instead to a garage at the front of the house. There is a trompe l'oeil painting of an oval window Beetle on the garage door. He now unlocks and opens it to reveal ... a metallic grey Range Rover. 'Volkswagens are all very well to collect', Carlton Hart thinks to himself, 'but I wouldn't actually want to drive one.' * * * *</page></plain_text>
