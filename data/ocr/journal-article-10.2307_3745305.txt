<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD AND MAN Professor CLEMENT C. J. WEBB Just three years ago I contributed to this Journal a few remarks on the problem of the relation of "God" to "the World." I propose in the present article to add some observations on the closely con? nected (and, indeed, overlapping) problem of the relation of "God" to "Man"; especially in view of the theory, by no means a new one, biit at the moment much in evidence (and that in more shapes than one), that when we speak of God what we have really in mind is our own human nature or some part or aspect of it, imaginatively objectified as a distinct or independent reality. Nowhere can this theory be studied to greater advantage than in the brilliant work of Ludwig Feuerbach, Das Wesen des Christ- enthums, published in 1841, and translated into English in 1854 by Marian Evans, better known as George Eliot, the celebrated novelist. Most of the later developments of the type of thought which finds expression in this book are anticipated in it in principle, and it was with a very just appreciation of its importance that the late Baron von Hugel took it for the text of his admirable essay on Religion and Illusion, which is included in the first series of his Essays and Addresses on the Philosophy of Religion, published during his lifetime, in 1921. From the time of the Greek satirist Xenophanes, who, in his attack upon the degrading stories about the gods which repelled so many of the highest minds among the Greeks from the popular religion, observed that if oxen or horses or lions could make images of their deities, they would make them like oxen or horses or lions, as the case might be, with as much or as little right as we make images of ours like men, down to the time of Rupert Brooke's poem entitled "Fish," the anthropomorphism of our theologies has aroused the doubt and suspicion of acute-minded men. The story in the book of Genesis which tells us how God made man in his own image inevitably appears (to all who do not take it for the record of an actual historical fact supernaturally revealed to the writer) as a naive attempt to justify such anthropomorphism; and this is of course the point of the often-quoted epigram that God made man in his own image, and man has ever since been returning the compliment. Among the Greek philosophers who came after Xenophanes we find the greatest of all?Plato?seriously concerned to disentangle 559</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES from one another a right and a wrong anthropomorphism. No one could have shown himself more unsparingly severe than Plato towards the legendary or literary mythology which fell under Xenophanes' lash, no one more earnest in denying to the divinity not merely the outward shape of man?he does not trouble himself about that, for no educated thinker of his day would, I suppose, have attributed this to God?but any share in human weakness or passion. Yet he was at least as much in earnest in tracing in the world-order the vestiges of a Mind and Reason, the archetype and source of the mind and reason which are in man. For the same reason which discovers the unreasonableness and therefore the vanity of fabies which ascribe to the gods "body, parts or passions," in that very act affirms its own transcendence of the animal organism with which it is associated and the immanence in itself of an absolute criterion of truth and falsehood; that is to say, it affirms, if not its own godhead, at least its own godlikeness. In the subsequent history of European religion we find in Christ? ianity a doctrine of God which retains the horror of idolatry charac? teristic of the Judaism in the bosom whereof Christianity arose, and is (as anyone knows who is familiar with the classical literature of Christian theology) as far removed as can well be, in its insistence (inspired by Greek philosophy) on the simplicity, eternity, and self- sufficiency of the divine nature, from anything which can properly be called anthropomorphism?anthropomorphism, indeed, it reckons as a heresy?but we find this doctrine united with a doctrine of the incarnation of God which notwithstanding declares this divinity to have been supremely manifested in an historical individual human life and personality. The concluding stanzas of Dante's Paradiso, describing the vision of the Godhead which crowned his pilgrimage through hell, purgatory, and heaven, express in unforgettable words this paradox at the heart of his religion. He sees the likeness of a man as it were painted on the midmost of the three circling rays, like rainbows mutually reflecting each other, which symbolize the triune Deity. Qual e'l geometra ehe tutto s'affige Per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritrova Pensando quel principio ond'egli indige; Tale era io a quella vista nuova; Veder voleva, come si convenne L'imago al cerchio, e come vi slndova; Ma non eran da cio le proprie penne, Se non ehe la mia mente f u percossa Da un fulgore, in ehe sua voglia venne. Air alta fantasia qui manco possa; Ma gia volgeva il mio disiro e il velle, Si come rota ch'egualmente 6 mossa, L'amor ehe move il sole e Faltre stelle. 560</page><page sequence="3">GOD AND MAN Unquestionably in religion?and not in the Christian religion only, though there most obviously?the image of the human spirit is discoverable in the object which man worships; is it not perhaps, so we are invited to ask ourselves, in truth no more in the end than the reflection of ourselves? Is the mysterious glory, as of an abso? lute, transcendent perfection, by which it seems to be encompassed, indeed an independent reality, or not only an appearance incident to the process of reflexion? Such is the question involved in the suggestion made by the theory or theories to which I propose in this article to call attention. The starting-point of Feuerbach was the philosophy of Hegel; and it is easy to see that this philosophy, taken in a certain way, might lead to the view that "Religion is the childlike condition of humanity," in which man sees his own nature as something outside of himself. "Hence," as Feuerbach declares, "the historical progress of Religion consists in this: that what by an earlier religion was regarded as objective, is now recognized as subjective; that is, what was formerly contemplated and worshipped as God, is now perceived to be something human. What was at first religion becomes at a later period idolatry." "Man has given objectivity to himself, but has not recognized this object as his own nature; a later religion takes this forward step; every advance in religion is therefore a further self-knowledge. But every particular religion excepts itself ?and necessarily so, otherwise it would no longer be religion?from the fate, the common nature of all religions. . . . It is our task to show that the antithesis of divine and human is altogether illusory; that it is nothing else than the antithesis between human nature in general and the human individual." The difference between the view here outlined and the Hegelian view, of which it was a development, lies, as I take it, in this, that for Hegel himself the truth is not so much that the divine is "human nature in general" as that the human spirit, rightly understood, is divine; and that whereas, for Feuerbach, the "human individual" is what is truly real, and that which we know first as the "divine" nature is just what is common to all individuals of the human species, for Hegel "the truth is," as he on one occasion says,1 "that there is only one Reason, one Spirit; that Spirit as finite has no true existence." But for Hegel, as for Feuerbach, God's otherness (upon the religious importance of which Rudolf Otto has lately insisted so much) is illusory; and it is the function of religion, and that most conspicuously in its Christian form, to transcend this illusion and to recognize practically, as philosophy will go on to 1 Werke, xii. p. 287, Philosophy of Religion, English translation by Spiers and Sanderson, iii. p. 77. 561</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES recognize theoretically, the reality which it has concealed from us, namely, the unity of man with God as one Spirit. I propose, however, on this occasion to begin my discussion of the theory that our knowledge of God is nothing else than know? ledge of ourselves by considering it in the form which it assumes in the mind of those who, taking upon the whole what we may call a naturalistic view of reality, regard religion as an illusion which in the maturity of human intelligence must necessarily be discarded. I will reserve, until I have dealt with this, any examination of the form in which it is presented by idealistic philosophers who, holding Spirit to be the one genuine reality, are prepared to allow to the religious consciousness a higher degree of validity than belongs to the ordinary consciousness or to that with which the natural sciences are concerned, but who would regard the antithesis of God and man implied in the practice of religious worship as destined to be transcended in philosophy, since, when we know that, in Hegel's words, "there is only one Spirit," and that "Spirit as finite has no true existence," we can no longer regard the relation of worship (or, perhaps, any relation) as belonging to the ultimate constitution of reality. An interesting example of the naturalistic variety of the theory which sees in the divine nature the human in disguise is that afforded by the French sociological school whose leader was the late Emile Durkheim and their organ the journal called UAnnee Sociologique. The tendency of this school?though Durkheim himself eventually reached a position which did, in my judgment, more justice to the facts than that adopted by most of his colleagues?was to assume that, because religion rests upon what they call "collective repre? sentations"?in other words, is in its origin a function of social life ?it cannot claim objective validity. This assumption seems to me to be unjustified. The attempt to identify "pure reason" with that kind of thought for which nothing but the abstract individual is real, to deny objective value to what these writers call "collective representations," just because they are "collective" and not merely individual, is, I am convinced, fundamentally mistaken. Indeed, the very natural sciences which such thinkers, like other Positivists (for the school of which I am speaking has inherited the Comtian tradition), are apt to take it for granted constitute the sole channel by which reality is revealed to us as nearly in its true nature as our intelligence is capable of apprehending it, must be, on their premises, involved in the same fate with religion, since they too rest upon "collective representations." The whole position of Naturalism is undermined for us when we come to perceive that natural science cannot be the one sufficient basis of philosophy, because it cannot account for its own existence, but necessarily 562</page><page sequence="5">GOD AND MAN assumes the existence of truth and the possibility of distinguishing truth from error, thus by implication ascribing to the mind a character which, as a merely natural phenomenon, capable of being exhaustively studied by the method used in the natural sciences, it could not possibly possess. In regard to the special contention of the French sociologists that in the object of religion we have only an imaginative representation of the unity which binds together human individuals in society, we need not indeed doubt that the object of religion is first envisaged as that with which the individual has to do in his experience of a communal life shared by him with the other members of his tribal group. Yet we must note that this comes to be distinguished from everything which can be merely identified with the principle or sentiment of communal life, as soon as "the individual attains the level of development at which he not only sees in that which all his fellows recognize as valid or desirable the really or objec? tively valid, the really or objectively desirable, but comes to recognize that something may be really and objectively valid or desirable which not only he but his whole group fails to accept or to desire."1 Nor is it only what is ultimately differ? entiated as religion which is at first implicated in the social experience. The fact, insisted upon to exaggeration by these same French sociologists, that the attention to the measurement of time and space which is eventually so important in the intellectual life of man is, it would seem, first aroused in connexion with the institutions of tribal life and tribal religion, illustrates the truth that, when man begins to concern himself with the universe, it is from the point of view of his society, of his group. "The con? sciousness of the world is mediated to him through the conscious? ness of his group. It is in becoming aware of himself as a member of a group, as living in it a life which distinguishes from his indi? vidual life as larger, more fundamental, more sacred, that he starts out on the way that will eventually lead him on to the adventures of science and of philosophy."2 Another form of the naturalistic version of the theory which finds in the God of religion only man's mistake of "his natural face in a glass" for the face of Another is that which it assumes in the hands of the exponents of what is often called "the new psychology." Just as it would be a mistake to overlook the importance of the light thrown upon the religious experience by the work of those who, with the French sociologists, would see in it merely an imagina? tive expression of our social experience?since it is true that man's r See the present writer's Group Theories of Religion and the Individual, pp. 159, 160. - Ibid., pp. 75, 76. 563</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES religious experience is most commonly mediated to him through his social?and yet social experience will not account without remainder for religious experience; so too it would be a mistake to ignore the contribution which a consideration of religious doctrines in the light of any knowledge which we may be able to obtain through psycho? therapy of the obscure and subconscious workings of the human mind may make to our comprehension of that experience. Never? theless, it does not follow that our religious doctrines have, as it is sometimes put, no ontological value, but only a psychological; or, in simpler words, that they describe no reality other than our own inner states. The very same line of argument which would persuade us of this, logically carried out, would leave us no real external world; would perhaps even leave to each one of us no real fellow human beings beside himself. For, unquestionably, our perceptions of the external world and our mutual relations with each other have, no less than what we call our religious experience, a psychological history as incidents in the course of our individual life. The assump? tion which even the "new psychologist" makes throughout of the independent reality of the external world and of other persons beside himself is not in kind different from the conviction which the religious man has that in his religious experience he has to do with Another beside himself. No doubt religious experience is differen? tiated from our perception of the external world by the inapplica- bility in the former case of verification by other sources than those which mediated the original perception. But in the case of our relations with our fellows it will be readily apparent on considera? tion that our recognition of them as persons cannot be explained (though the attempt so to explain it has not unfrequently been made) as merely an "inference" from our perception of their bodily shape and movements by analogy with our own. Such inference may indeed play a part in the recognition, but a direct rapport transcending anything that such an inference by itself could give us is absolutely requisite; while, for the maintenance of such know? ledge of our fellows as belongs to the closer kinds of intimacy, a continuous voluntary exercise of interest is necessary, to which the active seeking of God in prayer, which is indispensable to the retention of a living conviction of his reality and presence, is entirely parallel. When we pass from what I have distinguished as the naturalistic form of the theory which sees in God only our own nature reflected to what we may call its idealistic form, what appears, to me at any rate, a far more difficult problem is raised. Here, too, several varieties of the theory may be recognized, but I can only now deal with these very summarily and superficially. All of them may, I think, be said to have their roots in the thought, a statement of 564</page><page sequence="7">GOD AND MAN which by Hegel I quoted above; and, if we neglect such kindred speculations as may have been suggested in the Far East by the thought, so familiar to Indian piety, of God as the Atman or true Self, and confine ourselves to modern European philosophy, we may say that they are in the main to be found in the schools which have drawn inspiration from the teaching of Hegel. Of Englishmen, two distinguished thinkers who have passed away within the last few years, Bradley and Bosanquet, and of contemporaries elsewhere, the two leaders of Italian thought, Croce and Gentile, all exhibit in some measure the tendency of which I am speaking. In the case of the two former, however, it is perhaps only in a slight measure; though many a religious person who can neither bring himself to abandon worship, nor yet to render it except to One who is both Another than himself and also the ultimate Reality in whose being his own is rooted, in whom he "lives and moves and has his being," will be apt to think that their account of religion has "taken away his Lord" and left him only an experience of his own. Nor do I pretend to be content myself with the theory of religion to be found in the works of Bradley and Bosanquet (I am neglecting here?as they generally did themselves?differences between the two which appear to me to be in other respects important). But I do not think that it can fairly be said of it that it finds in God only our own humanity. Bradley has expressly affirmed that "there is nothing more real than comes in religion"; and if God is not for him (or for Bosanquet) ultimately real, so neither is man; both are "appear? ances"; and of the two it is God that manif ests the more fully the nature of that which is real, namely the Absolute. What "comes in religion" would by neither thinker be described as exclusively human. Indeed, the polemic of Bosanquet's last book, The Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary Philosophy, is directed against the Italian idealists precisely on the ground that they are too exclusively humanistic, in not allowing, for instance, that the beauty of nature is an independent source of inspiration to man, but making it out to be merely the expression of human emotion. These Italian idealists, on the other hand, may, I think, be reasonably held to be maintaining a theory which makes the object of religion, when rightly understood, no other than the human spirit. Croce, indeed, denies to religion the rank of an autonomous and permanent activity of that spirit; it is for him an immature form of philosophy, destined, whenever men's intellectual develop? ment has reached the stage of full maturity, to be superseded thereby. To Gentile it is more than this. It is a permanent "moment" (in the German sense of the word) or factor in the life of the human spirit, with which we cannot conceive of it as dispensing; yet, if I under? stand his view rightly (of which I am far from being confident), he 20 565</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES also, like Croce, regards it as in the main, at any rate, a kind of knowledge, in which what we ultimately come to know as our own spiritual essence appears to us as other than ourselves, that being here apprehended as transcendent which philosophy apprehends as immanent. I do not, however, profess to have an acquaintance with Gentile's philosophy sufficient to entitle me to speak with assurance about it; and in bringing him forward as an example of a theory which makes God's nature in the last resort man's in disguise, I may well be attributing that view to one who might justly disclaim it. My interest is, however, for the moment in the fact that an idealistic as well as a naturalistic version of this theory may be entertained, whether it be actually embraced by a particular thinker or not. Now that "he who," in St. Paul's language, "is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit" is a conviction which lies at the very heart of religion in general and of the Christian religion in particular. No doubt the spiritual unity of two or more persons who are connected by membership of a community or, in more intimate fashion, by a common purpose or by mutual love, does not abolish but requires and depends upon their difference from one another. But the rela? tion of a finite person to God cannot be conceived as the same relation which exists between one finite person and another. The meta? physical principle enunciated by Spinoza in the saying Quicquid est, in Deo est, and the religious sense of entire dependence upon God even in our consciousness of him, alike forbid us so to conceive it. Thus the way is laid open to a doctrine of God's immanence which seems on the one hand to leave us no personal object of religious worship, and on the other to make our own life a part of the divine life which in its own way is as truly and necessarily a part of it as any other, so that in coming to know anything of God we are coming to know something which is essentially not other than our own nature, but that which is it or is continuous with it and, if continuous with it, then not continuous with it after the manner of a material continuum, each part of which is external to every other, but after the manner of a spirit, in regard to which the notion of externality has no application at all. It is, I think, easy to see that the appropriation of a view of this kind, while in a mystic who feels his own life already one with the divine it might tend to destroy the humility which is begotten of a sense of the contrast between the littleness of man and the greatness of God, would in an ordinary person be apt rather to lower, if I may so express it, the temperature of the spiritual life by suggesting that there is no actually existent quality of life superior to that which is manifested in the highest civilization at present attained by man; so that one could say in a phrase which Bosanquet has some? where quoted from Turgenieff: "I believe in civilization and I 566</page><page sequence="9">GOD AND MAN require no further creed." In either case it seems to take out of religion something with which it cannot well dispense. Nor is it surprising that after a period during which the current of thought, especially in Germany, had set strongly in the direction of a purely immanentist and secular or "this worldly" conception of the object of religious experience, we should find, especially in that country, such a reaction towards an even exaggerated insistence on the otherness of God as we find in Otto's doctrine of the "numinous" and in the emphasis laid by such writers as Karl Barth on the neces? sity of regarding religion as the reception of a revelation coming into our life in this world from a sphere quite different from that in which our civilization is at home. All I have to add on this occasion will do little but repeat what I said in my previous article on "God and the World." (i) The religious experience depends upon the tension between the consciousness of being other than God and that of being one with God, and cannot afford to abolish either in favour of the other. (2) While religion cannot be content with ascribing personality to its object in a sense which would set the worshipper and his God side by side after the fashion of two finite persons, and make their personalities mutually exclusive; yet still less can it be content to ascribe to God a less completely concrete individuality than to his worshipper; so that in no sense of personality in which the word connotes the kind of actual substantial existence of which we are aware in ourselves and in our fellows can it be ascribed to the worshipper and denied to God. (3) The mystery of personality or (if we prefer the expression) of concrete or substantial individuality, which must ever elude the grasp of any general explanation or account of the spiritual nature which yet exists in this way and only in this way, involves the presence in religious experience of a genuinely personal relation as an abiding moment or factor in that spiritual life which is in that experience revealed as the supreme and ultimate Reality. 567</page></plain_text>
