<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYLVESTER'S DU BARTAS AND THE METAPHYSICAL ANDROGYNY OF OPPOSITES BY JOHN LOUIS LEPAGE Antithesis is a matter of scientific as well as poetic distinction. Renaissance natural science regarded physical contrast somewhat in terms of opposition on an infinite line, whose extremest points observable in nature appear to touch, circularly adumbrating the relationship of God and man. John Arthos has pointed out the extrinsic relationship of science and poetry in their respective lan- guages. His work is fraught with subtle misunderstandings but his observations are important. Arthos's starting point, from which he moves antithetically backward to the classics and forward to the end of the eighteenth century, is the French sixteenth-century encyclopedist, Guillaume de Saluste, Sieur Du Bartas (1544- 1590), and especially his English translator, Joshua Sylvester (1563-1618). 1 With good reason; for Les Semaines is the first major and influential work of combined science and poetry of the French Renaissance, and Sylvester's translation, the Divine Weeks, ex- erted an influence on the mainstream poets that is difficult to overestimate. Evaluated stylistically, the most prominent device of Les Se- maines is antithesis. It need not be strenuously argued that an- tithesis is in part a structural device and in large part a device of thought. In Sylvester's Divine Weeks antithesis creates the struc- tural qualities of Augustan poetry-making Sylvester an important precursor of the formidable Augustan line and the balanced heroic couplet-and a conceptual superstructure upon which English metaphysical poetry builds. Development of line and narrative in Du Bartas relies on the spur of opposition: Tempestent sans tempeste, et, pour nous abismer, Vomissent en ronflant une mer dans la mer. (5:853-54) 621</page><page sequence="2">The opposition is more forceful in Sylvester's translation: Or whatsoever other Monster haunts In storme-lesse seas, raising a storme about. (5:906-7)2 In Homer and Virgil, the raising of a storm is often regarded as an inversion of the natural order of things. Virgil, for instance, creates an image, in the Aeneid, of waves being so disproportionate as to lash the stars, defying gravity (3:423). The storm and the calm complement one another; at their extremes they are equally un- natural, and either acts as a foil for a natural state. In the above two lines from Divine Weeks the word "stormlesse,"' with its neg- ative suffix, is a rhetorical precondition for the raising of a "storm,"' and thus for the figuring in agnominatio. The figure is a connotative example of what Cleanth Brooks suggests is the modifying capacity of words in poetry: The tendency of science is necessarily to stabilize terms, to freeze them into strict denotations; the poet's tendency is by contrast disruptive. The terms are continually modifying each other, and thus violating their dictionary meanings .3 Brooks is perhaps mistaken about the nature of scientific en- quiry-which may, at the pure level, be disruptive-but his judg- ment of poetry is valid, and true especially of Sylvester's Du Bartas. Northrop Frye gives this power of words a religious ca- pacity to confirm a doubt in what he calls "creative doubt," ap- plying the term to a Bible which he feels is dedicated-like all poetry-to expanding consciousness.4 Sylvester's calm seas are present in the first instance to put into relief the storms that can be artificially made by sea monsters. A monster's artifice can "raise" a storm from nothing; its artifice is modelled on God's art, which also raises storms. The agnominatio in Sylvester's lines mag- nifies the creative act. A heaven-spurred storm in Vaughan's The Storm is rhetorically promoted in much the same way, but with negative prefixes: Thus the enlarged, enraged air uncalms these to a flood Vaughan's lines begin with a forced emphasis on the prefix "en-," which is then modified in the second line to "un-," creating an 622 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="3">unusual verb, "uncalms. " The curiousness of the verb foregrounds it, making the storm a creation. Donne uses the same procedure as Vaughan in The Progress of the Soul (stanza 32).5 The rhetoric of agnominatio involves itself intimately with the preconditioning and definitive quality of antithesis. One word for which Du Bartas pointedly apologizes in Les Se- maines is "Antiperistasis. " The defense is a kind of loose antithesis in its own right, an awareness of its possible impropriety and a justification of it on the very grounds of propriety. The word ex- plains the foil-like capacity of antithesis: 'Tis (doubtless) this Antiperistasis (Beare with the Word, I hold it not amisse T'adopt sometimes such strangers for our use, When Reason and Necessitie induce: As namely where our Native Phrase doth want A word so force-full and significant). - . . (2:465-70) The word is brashly new (an OED first citation). It explains scien- tifically the effects of extreme opposition in nature. Hot is made hotter when juxtaposed with cold. But it also determines an ex- treme opposition in which sensibilities are inverted, cold pro- ducing heat, heat cold. Bacon talks about the quality in Novum Organum as "instances in proximity where the nature of heat is absent."'6 Poetically this antithesis has a long lineage. It may be found in Virgil, for instance: ne . . . Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat (Georgics, 1:92-93). Aristotle's rhetorical analysis of antithesis is certainly correct within its own terms: This kind of style is pleasing, because things are best known by opposition, and are all the better known when the opposites are put side by side; and is pleasing also because of its resemblance to logic-for the method of refutation is the juxtaposition of contrary conclusions.7 Aristotle's understanding of antithesis refers to its display in a shaped line of poetry, certainly to shaped oratory; and the emer- gence of the alexandrine couplet in France in the sixteenth century may have encouraged a like formal, useful, antithesis. Aristotle apparently takes the device as the finding of dissimilitude in the John Louis Lepage 623</page><page sequence="4">similitude of comparison. And this is a logical step of applied sci- ence; that is, to test. But poetry is different. Even Aristotle prefers to regard poetic meaning as the finding of similitude in dissimili- tude.8 When antithesis is used in poetry dissimilitude comes to mean opposition. The metaphorical result is a creation of one entity out of exploding-in Koestlerian terms-opposition. And this is where antiperistatic science becomes serviceable to poetry. In Du Bartas, because cold makes hot seem hotter, it may be said to define hot in a way that the mean cannot, and may in a round- about way be seen as a metonymy for it. Geometrically, the con- tinuum of hot and cold would be represented as a circle, in which cold begins by being strikingly different from hot, but as it be- comes extreme it resembles extreme heat. The adjective extreme itself defines the unity and is opposed only relativistically to the non-opposite mean. The preconditioning quality of antithesis in Les Semaines might be likened to a mother giving birth to a child, but, instead of from female to male or female, the birth-giving is indiscriminately as from positive to negative or negative to positive. The frequency of the devices of agnominatio, anaphora, and symploce in the work is some indication of the antithetical, birth-giving character of Du Bartas's -and Sylvester's -approach to metaphor and narrative line. The large number of "-less" and "-full" ending adjectives, and of "un-" and "dis-" beginning adjectives in Divine Weeks, seem to indicate the rounding of opposition. 9 Such qualifying adjectives are the rhetorical mothers of their opposites. But these are added flesh, and it is in the generative images and concepts and their opposite offspring that Les Semaines and Divine Weeks most an- ticipate the metaphysical strain in English poetry. Not the least of the antithetical relations seized upon by Du Bartas is that of the soul and the body, the two mutually hostile components of man: a Serpahin that, bore A waving sword, whose bodie shined bright, Like flaming Comet in the midst of night, A bodie meerely Metaphysicall, Which (differing little from th'ONE unicall, Th'Act-simplie-pure, the onlie-beeing BEEING,) Approcheth matter, n'erthelesse, not being Of matter mixt: or rather is so made So meerelie spirit, that, not the murdering blade, His joyned quantitie can part in two, 624 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="5">For pure it cannot Suffer ought, but Doe. (Imposture, 636-46) This extract explores the gulf that lies between body and soul, a metaphysical gulf. The angel can mysteriously approach matter, but is unmixed of it. It has none of the solid and fluid of "matter mixt"; it is immaterial, spirit. For Du Bartas, all things in nature are material lodgings for a soul. It is in seeing the souls of all things-even of the world-analogistically as "kindred spirits" that metaphysical poets are "metaphysical." Physical dispropor- tions in Du Bartas and in the metaphysical baroque, or dissimili- tudes-or even opposites-may be overleapt as such because of a spiritual likeness that spreads from the world as a whole to all of its members, including man. Here it would perhaps be of value to remember Dr. Johnson on the passionate concern of the me- taphysical poets with a progressive unity in opposition: But, wit, abstracted from its effects upon the hearer, may be more rigorously and philosophically considered as a kind of discordia concors; a combination of dissimilar images, or discovery of occult resemblances in things apparently unlike. Of wit, thus defined, they have more than enough. The most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together; nature and art are ransacked for illus- trations, comparisons and allusions. . . .'o A suggestive word in Johnson's not incorrect attack is the adjective "occult,&gt;" which implies a wit shared by these poets and not by Dr. Johnson. But, surely, after the initial shock of an image-a desired effect-the wit is not entirely inscrutable. One difference between Sylvester's Du Bartas and the rest of the metaphysical pack is in genre. Du Bartas's epic forces upon him a Virgilian concern with narrative line. Donne, on the other hand, often suffers only the exigencies of his conceit. This differ- ence in kind (in superstructure) has probably tended to obscure the similarities that do exist between Sylvester and Donne and subsequent metaphysical poetry.'1 We have seen Sylvester trans- late a storm that uprises as a rhetorical necessity only out of exact calm. Donne is fixated on a notion like Ignatius Loyola's, that "no storm is so insidious as a perfect calm," as a matter of antiperistatic definition: for Donne a calm is almost always like a storm. In two poems to Christopher Brooke, The Storm and The Calm, the first lines of the latter effect a synthesis of the two poems: Our storme is past, and that storms tyrannous rage, John Louis Lepage 625</page><page sequence="6">A stupid calme, but nothing it, doth swage; The fable is inverted, and farre more A blocke afflicts, now, then a storke before. Donne tells us pointedly that "The fable is inverted"; indeed, our expectations are thrown upside-down. It were surely as if The Storm had been designed as a disturbing foil for this far stormier calm. The antithesis of the opening lines of The Calm may differ in fact from those of Du Bartas and Sylvester quoted above, but they illustrate a predominating philosophical aspect of Les Se- maines, that may have been transmitted as a poetic concern to Donne by Sylvester. The proverbial "calm before a storm"&gt; is inverted in Donne's two poems, but the sense of the generation of opposites lying in the proverb and figured in agnominatio in Sylvester becomes the very subject of The Calm: We can nor lost friends, nor sought foes recover, But meteorlike, save that wee move not, hover. Onely the Calenture together drawes Deare friends, which meet dead in great fishes jawes: And on the hatches as on Altars lyes Each one, his own Priest, and owne Sacrifice. (21-26) Friends beget foes; the metaphor of motion, in the compound "meteorlike," begets motionlessness. The rhetorical antithesis verges on oxymoron, but its meaning is so intense as to produce something near paradox. "Meteorlike" conjures not merely mo- tion, but shooting motion, save of course "that we move not"; but it is also an intellectual conjuring in Donne, completed by the oppositional, line-ending word, standing aloof, "hover": we, like meteors, are a thing of space. Similarly, Sylvester's angel is meta- physical, like a "flaming Comet" caught motionless "in the midst of night." The struggle between motion and fixed stability in Donne is perhaps further glossed by this antithetical passage from Crashaw's "To the Noblest and Best of Ladies": Almighty love! end this long war, And of a meteor make a star. Oh, fix this faire indefinite.... (29-31) Crashaw's prayer to love is almost a thing of futility, since to "fix this faire indefinite" were to destroy it. For his part, Donne rec- 626 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="7">ognizes a "fair indefinite" not only in a fixed hovering, but in an animating heat which prefigures the coldness of death. The play on the hot fever of love and the hot calentures of men caught motionless in a rank, stagnant sea is brought together with the chill of death. Thomas Carew takes up the wordplay in his poem "Upon the Sickness of E. S.": Under whose shadow let her rest secure From chilling cold or burning calenture: Unless she freeze with ice of chaste desires.... (41-43) Love is the culprit. As with Crashaw above, there are two kinds of love: a warm indefinite, and a cold almighty one. The near oxymoron "chaste desires" suggests the incompatability of the two. From Petrarchan poetry love is a feverish desire which culminates in the figurative death of sexual intercourse. The likening of love- making, which is regenerative, to death is itself antiperistatic. From the Christian tradition a chaste love leads to freedom from death only in death. Donne's final image- Each one, his owne Priest, and owne Sacrifice owes directly neither to the Christian nor the Petrarchan tra- dition; rather, I believe, to a number of oxymorons in Divine Weeks that point analogistically to heavenly love and afterlife. These explore the paradox of one person being both sacrificer and sacrifice. It is a paradox that pervades the Fathers, for instance, in which Abraham begins by being an "inconstant neuter" (240) enduring the "&lt;counter-puffs"' of the artificially opposed love of his son and the love of his God. Abraham comments at one point on the paradox of Isaac's carrying the fagot for his own sacrifice: "Both Priest and Beast of one same Sacrifice" (301). The line reads star- tlingly like Donne s. Other such formulations are abundant in Di- vine Weeks. For the moment I am rather interested in the syn- thesis of antithesis in Sylvester's Du Bartas and parallelly in Donne. This convergence arising from a divergence is something approaching the device of synoeciosis. If I may employ a Renais- sance commonplace, the foil of antithesis gives definition to the stone of the narrative tenor; but at its farthest extreme, through a metonymic principle, the foil can reflect, actually equal or out- shine the stone.12 John Louis Lepage 627</page><page sequence="8">In Elegy 9 Donne says, "I hate extremes," but our "'creative doubt" finds this a too honest baring of the soul to be believed; and later in the same poem Donne refers significantly to the cradle and the tomb. In fact, Donne enjoys extremes, whether they be in terms of oxymoronic imagery or in terms of scientific descrip- tion. Yoked extremes, particularly of birth and death, are generally indebted in Donne to Divine Weeks. II Alluma pour guider son nud Leandre a bord Au lieu du feu d'amour la torche de la mort.... (5:917-18) Whear love-blind Heros hap-less diligence, In steed of Loves lampe, lighted Deaths cold brand, To waft Leanders naked limbes to land: (5:978-80) Du Bartas emphasizes rhetorically the synthesis of love (a life- giving thing) and death in a way that Sylvester cannot. For he flings together these flames with a unifying paronomasia ("d'amour/de la mort") that cannot be equalled in the English lan- guage. But Sylvester's divided line matches the rhetorical antith- esis of the original alexandrines, and the unity-out-of-opposition of subject by retaining the apposite "lampe" and "brand." Love is replaced by death; the warmth-the heat-of love is countered by an oxymoronic "cold brand." Du Bartas's vehicle-contextually in an epic digression on chaste love-is the classical story of Hero and Leander. Both original and translation hint at the eroticism of the story-"Leanders naked limbs" and its sad conclusion "Heros hap-less diligence." Marlowe's treatment of the story, in Hero and Leander, portrays a love that on one side is only cold infatuation with beauty. The image is of equally cold eroticism, if such is possible. In Les Semaines the digression only stands to serve a greater digression, constrastingly about chaste love. The digression proper is about the mutual love of an eagle and a woman, concluding finally in a surrogate climax of death. Du Bartas apostrophizes on the immortality that they will achieve in his verse, which Sylvester renders thus: o happie Payer upon your sable Toombe, May Mel and Manna every showring come; 628 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="9">May sweetest Mirtles ever shade your Herse, And evermore live you within my Verse. (5:1083-86) The immortality suggested in the lines is one expression of the oxymoron "dead-live" (e.g., 5:943). Simon Goulart, Du Bartas's commentator, defends Du Bartas's short narrative of love, and its last, self-indulgent line, by referring vaguely to an earlier prece- dent in Virgil-Fortunati ambo? si quid mea earmina possunt / Nulla dies unquam memori vos eximet ovo.13 At any rate, the self- indulgence is topical. But I believe Du Bartas has something to say about a paradox of love and death, and assuredly about a con- trast between faithful love and lust. Marlowe's is a rhetorically complex treatment of lust: So beauty sweetly quickens when 'tis nigh, But being separated and removed, Burns where it cherished, murders where it loved. (2:126-28) Beauty itself, "loves lampe," finally generates a false light: A kind of twilight break, which through the hair As from an orient cloud, glimpse here and there; And round about the chamber this false morn Brought forth the day before the day was born. (2:319-22) The last paradox is brilliant, a "witty expatiation" such as the meta- physical poets were later fond of. 14 The line would have suited Du Bartas. And the structure and phraseology are reminiscent of Sylvester at his best. Marlowe's inversion of the natural order of things is not a comment, however, on this natural order of things so much as the suggestion of an unnatural transfiguration. The distinction, it seems to me, is important. The juxtaposition in the former passage of "burns"' with "cherished" is metaphorically a repetition of ideas rather than an antithesis, following in parison that of "separated"I and "removed." The link between "murders" and "loved" is not of opposition, but of sequence. Marlowe pre- sents a lie rather than an opposition. And the final dawning in Hero is a moment of recognition that gives the lie. But the chiasmus of the last line describes a circle that structurally imitates this false creation of daylight. John Louis Lepage 629</page><page sequence="10">After the Hero and Leander aside in Divine Weeks comes the digression proper, the tale of a fair, noble, rich maid: There dwelt a Maide, as noble, and as rich, As faire as Hero, but more chast by much: (5:981-82) The lines here make use of the repeated adverb "as, in a pro- gression not unlike the device of climax. The development is not chiastic, having only three main components, but it does parabol- ically diverge and then converge. Here for the first time there is sense in the smuggled allusion to Hero and Leander. Du Bartas's chaste maiden is introduced in Sylvester's translation as one whose "steel brest" blunts the blades of "Paphos' Archer"; she is a heroic battle figure in the war of love. Spenser's female warrior, Britomart, literally, in her armor, bears such a steel breast, but there appears periodically in her a spasmodic wistfulness for some Heroic, passionate love, as for in- stance at the end of Faerie Queene, book 3. The sensual, Marlovian tenor of these lines, their almost ingrown hostility to chastity, make interesting their exclusion from the 1596 edition of the Faerie Queene, and from thenceforth: Had ye them seene, ye would have surely thought, That they had been that faire Hermaphrodite, Which that rich Romane of white marble wrought, And in his costly Bath causd to bee site: So seemd those two, as growne together quite, That Britomart halfe envying their blesse, Was much empassiond in her gentle spright, And to her selfe oft wisht like happinesse, In vaine she wisht, that fate n'ould let her possesse. 3. 12.46a The metaphor and approach to these lines bear some resemblance to a series of lines in Du Bartas; and the Christian fervor of Du Bartas's metaphor curiously anticipates the blithe manner in which Spenser couples the metaphor and the accomplishment of Brito- mart: Source de tout bon heur, amoureux Androgyne, Jamais je ne discour sur ta saincte origine, Que, ravi, je n'admire en quelle sorte alors D'un corps Dieu fit deux corps, puis de deux corps un corps. (6:987-90) 630 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="11">The emphasis on unity in diversity continues unexhausted. The story is of the creation of Eve, and of the immediate union in love of Adam and Eve. Eve has been torn from Adam's side, in division, and has returned in love and in unity of soul unto him, making the couple an androgynous one. The diction of the two passages is notable: first, Du Bartas's choice of the word "Androgyne" where Spenser has elected for the comparable "Hermaphrodite." As if by way of explanation of Spenser's word choice, Holland's Pliny says: "Children of both sexes, whom we call Hermaphrodites. In old time they were known by the name Androgyni. "15 The term "Hermaphrodite" is more common in the sixteenth century than its rare cousin, "Androgyne." In either case, the metaphor is at first difficult if not strained, poetically. Gascoigne had earlier written "I am in dede a Dame, or at the least, a right Hermaph- phrodite" ("The Steele Glas a Satyre," 50) as if in game, playing with the pleasant internal rhyme. But the use is not pointed, not, to use George Justus Lawler's designation for the unifying trope, part of a "heuristic myth."'16 Sylvester uses neither word, settling instead for a more disturbing compound epithet: Source of all joyes! sweet Hee-Shee-Coupled-One Thy sacred Birth I never thinke upon, But (ravisht) I admire how God did then Make Two of One, and One of Two againe. (6:1051-54) Elsewhere, however, Sylvester appears to be interested in the subject of androgyny: in the Vocation he translates "camp ef- femine" (297) into "Women-Men" (333); in the Handy-Crafts he creates the oxymoron "guirle-boy" (305) out of the antithesis "ceste femmelette en homme desguisee" (273). Sylvester's exclusion of the metaphor of androgyny is curious for still other reasons: the metaphor is evocative of a fusive strain prevalent elsewhere in Les Semaines and Divine Weeks. The metaphor is in fact a Renaissance emblem for several kinds of unity in diversity, and especially an emblem of self-regenera- tion.17 Its inclusion in the 1590 version of the Faerie Queene and its exclusion thereafter is a textual puzzle worth considering. In a cyclical "heuristic myth" the repeated cycle only ends at the con- clusion of time and motion; in the Christian scheme, on the day of Last Judgment. The hermaphrodite in Christian emblematics and equally in alchemy was an image of extempore creation and John Louis Lepage 631</page><page sequence="12">temporal regeneration, but not of conclusion. Spenser's her- maphroditic image may have sign-posted regeneration in three then unpublished books of the Faerie Queene, and would thus be unnecessary in subsequent complete editions of the text. The "Mu- tabilitie Cantoes" themselves debate the question of the change of a temporal world and final changelessness after the Last Judg- ment. In such a reading, the androgyny becomes an emblematic reflection on change and the self-regenerating cycles of change. There is a clever syllepsis on the word "ravis" in Du Bartas's treatment of the androgynous Adam. Here, and equally in Sylvester, the word has overtones of a reenactment, of a recrea- tion, of the androgynous impregnation of Adam and Eve (though caused, in fact, by God). Du Bartas, like Britomart, is a chaste spectator of this scene, who in spirit, for a moment, loses his chastity (without his inno- cence). The creation of Eve from Adam is a representation in min- iature of the creation of the world, one of a chain of analogous events in Les Semaines. By default it brings attention to a process, begun with first creation, that is recurrent and cyclical. Prop- erlywe should remark the chiasmus in both Du Bartas and Sylvester: two are made of one and then one of two again. The device maps a returning that describes a circle. 18 Behind this phe- nomenal birth of woman from man is the Sophoclean hint of a birth of mankind from man; and behind this lies the suggestion of a universe created by a God who thereupon mysteriously consti- tutes the universe. If the birth of woman from man, and the resultant unity, is androgynous, what are we to make of the birth of oneself from oneself? On this may hinge beliefs of creation ex nihilo and ex traduce. For Donne, as for Du Bartas and Sylvester, the difference between the two kinds of birth is scant: We'are Tapers too, and at our owne cost die, And we in us finde the Eagle and the Dove. The Phoenix ridle hath more wit By us, we two being one, are it. So, to one neutrall thing both sexes fit, Wee die and rise the same, and prove Mysterious by this love. ("The Canonization, 21-27) In "The Canonization" Donne gives human love a claim to sanctity which Spenser has for the moment dropped and which Du Bartas 632 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="13">attributes to God. Donne's lovers are both creator and creation. "We two being one" is a statement of being, different yet related to the love of Adam and Eve in Divine Weeks.'9 Donne here, as Sylvester, does not use the word "Androgyne," though he means it- So to one neutral thing both sexes fit. He means it also in one of his more Sylvestrian works, "The Prog- ress of the Soul,"&gt; though he alludes to it in rather savage terms: Some have their wives, their sisters some begot, But in the lives of emperors you shall not Read of a lust the which may equal this; This wolf begot himself, and finished What he began alive when he was dead.. (stanza 44) Here the androgyny expresses impossibility, and Donne makes use of the topos of the impossibilia, so characteristic of Divine Weeks. Donne does use the term "Hermaphrodite," however, in the Epithalamion, "made at Lincolnes Inne." Both the language and the content are reminiscent of Sylvester's Du Bartas: And you frolique Patricians, Sonnes of these Senators wealths deep oceans, Ye painted courtiers, barrels of others wits, Yee country men, who but your beasts love none, Yee of those fellowships whereof hee's one, Of study' and play made strange Hermaphrodits, Here shine; This Bridegroom to the Temple bring. (25-31) There are two proximate passages from Divine Weeks at Donne's disposal. Sylvester presents the mystery of androgynous love, with its incumbent sexuality, as we have seen, in the passages referred to above. But his androgyny is directed solely at the greater ref- erent of God. Donne's is in its own terms non-referential alter- ation. Crashaw's love is "mystical" and "High."- Thou art Love's victim, and must die A death more mystical and High; Into Love's arms thou shalt let fall A still surviving funeral. ("Hymne to St. Teresa," 75-78) John Louis Lepage 633</page><page sequence="14">Crashaw's is antithetical, phoenix-like, but not demonstratively androgynous; the last line above recalls the Sylvester formula of the linked cradle and tomb. Carew's love is, like Donne's, a par- adoxical, consuming oneness, but offers to its lovers instead of sanctity, idolatry: With bended knees I daily worship her, Yet she consumes her own idolater. ("A Cruel Mistress," 15-16) There is a strong suggestion of androgynous love throughout Sylvester's translation, that, it seems to me, must have caught the notice and the fancy of his contemporaries-including Donne- who came to be so taken with the image of the phoenix and with consuming love. The most familiar passage in Divine Weeks is the following: The Heav'nly Phoenix, first began to frame The Earthly Phoenix, and adorn'd the same With such a plume, that Phoebus, circuiting From Fez to Cairo, sees no fairer thing.... He did appoint her Fate to be her Pheere, And Deaths cold kisses to restore her heere Her life againe, which never shall expire Untill (as she) the World consume in fire. For, having passed under divers Climes, A thousand Winters, and a thousand Primes, Worne-out with yeeres, wishing her end-less end, To shining flames she doth her life commend: Dies to revive, and goes into her Grave To rise-againe more beautiful and brave. By breake of Day she builds (in narrow roome) Her Urne, her nest, her Cradle, and her Toombe: Where, while she sits all gladly-sad, expecting Some flame (against her fragrant heape reflecting) To burne her sacred bones to seed-full Cinders . Which (re-ingendred of it's selfly seed) By noblely dying a new Date begins, And where she loseth, there her life she winnes: End-less by'End, eternall by her Toombe, While by a prosperous Death, she doth become, Among the Cinders of her sacred Fire, Her owne selfes Heire, Nurse, Nurseling, Dam, and Sire: (5:587-642) The breadth of this account of the phoenix is impressive. The theme of the passage might be called paradox itself; and in this 634 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="15">respect original and translation are about equal. The account of the phoenix calls to mind Petrarch. Sylvester has possibly read Spenser's "The Visions of Petrarch" (5): I saw a Phoenix in the wood alone, With purple wings, and crest of golden hue. Spying the tree destroy'd, the water dried, Himself smote with his beake as in disdaine, And so forth with great despight he dide. The image is emblematic. The iconography of the bird sucking from its breast with its beak its life's blood is a figure for Christ (though the bird is most often a pelican). Spenser's lines are simply iconographic, and there is little or no interest in antithesis or par- adox. The description, next to Sylvester's above, is stark. In fact, the phoenix mythology, with its strong millennial over- tones, perfectly suits any connection with Christ. In 1601 Robert Chester's Love's Martyr or Rosalin's Complaint was published. The work consists of a loving verse description of the phoenix coupled with a dialogue between the phoenix and the turtle-dove. It antedates Sylvester's First Week, but seems to have been greatly influenced by Du Bartas, in the original, and, by my guess, in the 1598 translation. The poem features an enlargement of Du Bartas's phoenix description: Under this mirrour, are her princely eyes: Two Carbuncles, two rich imperial lights; That ore the day and night do Soveraignize, And their dimme Tapers to their rest she frights: Her eyes excell the Moone and glorious Sonne And when she riseth all their force is donne. (stanza 9) The diction is pronouncedly Sylvestrian: the adverbial adjective "princely"1; the jewelled eyes of "carbuncles"P; the periphrasis 'im- periall lights"&gt;; and the "ize" formulation are all standard compo- nents of Sylvester's language. But Chester's eye description is vast and elaborate when compared with Sylvester's "two sparkling eyes." Accompanying Chester's poem are a number of short lau- datory poems on the phoenix and the turtle-dove, including Shake- speare's, and several loosely related poems by Jonson, Chapman and Marston among others, and some anonymous poems.20 Few of the poems feature the discordia concors instrumental to the John Louis Lepage 635</page><page sequence="16">make-up of Sylvester's phoenix. One poem, however, which does anticipate metaphysical attitudes, includes the following lines: light my weaker eie: Raise my invention on swift Phantasie, That whilst of this same Metaphysicall God, Man, nor woman, but elix'd of all. My labouring thoughts, with strained ardor sing, My Muse may mount with an uncommon wing. (p. 177; 11. 21-26) The ardor of these lines-by Donne?-is manifest. The desire for "Metaphysicall" indeterminacy and "uncommon" verse appears fa- miliar with Sylvester's poetic "Metaphysicall" angel (Imposture, 639) and his oft-repeated Bartasian call for uncommon verse. "Swift Phantasie" is an odd phrase: given the paradoxical figure of the phoenix, what is curiously lacking in the poems of the collection is the "swift Phantasie" of antithesis, and of paradox. And there is little relation of the phoenix myth in the collection to the Christian framework, or to God. Donne treats of the phoenix in The First Anniversary as a re- flection of the destruction of an old world of Paradise, and the rising out of these ashes of a new world: 'Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone; All just supply, and all relation: Prince, subject, father, son, are things forgot, For every man alone thinks he hath got To be a phoenix, and that then can be None of that kind, of which he is, but he. (213-18) The passage is somewhat apocalyptic. In Sylvester's account of the phoenix the story relates purely to an aspect of God. The periphrasis "The Heav'nly Phoenix" ("'Ce- leste phenixe") is an unusual one in poetry. It designates a savior who will die, rise from the dead and return to rule over the mil- lennium. We find in him the utmost regenerative principle. The phoenix's love is her fate. Yet again, death is cold, like a "cold Brand," but-tied up with a metaphor of love-warmly kisses the phoenix. The oxymorons of the text (e.g., "End-less End," "gladly- sad," "seedfull Cinders," "prosperous Death") adumbrate the same regenerative fusion, the cycle of death and renewed life. Finally Sylvester's cradle/tomb formula, which is repeated in the passage, makes good sense: "Her Urne, her nest, her Cradle and 636 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="17">her Toombe." The line is the impossible equal of Donne's "Her own self's heir, nurse, nurseling, dam, and sire," or indeed of its cognate in The First Anniversary: "For that first marriage was our funeral" (105). The use of the possessive pronoun own," the oxy- moron and the paradox are familiar to Divine Weeks. The notion and condition of life being generated out of ashes is perhaps a fanciful one. But it has a long heritage in an antique cyclical view of nature, and in scriptural remonstrance (John 12:24-25): "Amen, Amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, itself remaineth alone. But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit." And the proof of this remark lies typically in Christ. In Du Bartas the fusion is not a simple oxymoron, but a vital paradox. It occurs again in Divine Weeks, 3:671; Colonies, 754; Vocation, 1416; and elsewhere. And so, it passes into the poetic thought and idiom of the seventeenth century. Drummond of Hawthornden recalls Sylvester when he describes the phoenix: So from a blacke Eclipse out-peeres the Sunne: Such (when a huge of Dayes have on her runne In a farre forest in the Pearly East, And shee herselfe hath burnt and spicie Nest) The Lonelie Bird with youthfull pennes and Combe Doth soar from out her Cradle and her Tombe. . ("Hymne 2," 35-40) John Ford has a Sophoclean paradox in mind, nurtured surely by metaphysical commonplace: She's dead; alas, good soul; the hapless fruit That in her womb received its life from me, Hath had from me a cradle and a grave. I must not dally. This sad marriage-bed, In all her best, bore her alive and dead. ('Tis Pity She's a Whore, 5.5.94-98) In Milton, however, it is more pointed, describing a universal historical process. The "wild abyss" of chaos is "The womb of na- ture and perhaps her grave" (Paradise Lost, 2.911). The line makes history seem inconsequential, fuses all creation into one chaos. Edward Young bleakly extemporizes on birth as a motion that leads only and inevitably to death: And Cradles rock us nearer to the tomb. (Night Thoughts, 5:718) John Louis Lepage 637</page><page sequence="18">From the fixed womb of birth comes the restless motion of life, a relentless and exhausting thing observed by poet and poet again; for instance, in Whitman's throbbing line, "Out of the cradle end- lessly rocking." The form of the paradox of equated life and death, or sacrifice and sacrificer for that matter, is preserved in some Augustan poetry, so that Pope can wittily write, At once the Chaser and at once the Prey. (Windsor Forest, 83) A similar formula, bizarre, but less paradoxical, is Pope's line in the Essay on Man: Of half that live the Butcher and the Tomb. (3:162) In Donne the phoenix/hermaphrodite paradox is a clever turn of phrase, but more, it is a first and last hope for regeneration, an expectation, and a device of creation: I hate extremes; yet I had rather stay With tombs, than cradles to wear out a day. Since such love's natural lation is, may still My love descend, and journey down the hill, Not panting after growing beauties, so, I shall ebb out with them, who homeward go. (Elegy 9, 45-50) The hill indicates a valley with yet another hill, and the motion is geometrically wave-like, with innumerable epicycles. Growth is replaced by the "ebb" of a yet contrary "homeward" motion. The words "cradle" and "tomb" bespeak the antiperistatic extremes that make life a sensation. Donne's is a "panting" yearning for these opposites, for in them he can apprehend the shape- defi- nition-of his and all nature. Only from "the Autumnal" (the name of this elegy) can a new spring arise. Here, Donne's phoenix/her- maphrodite only has emblematic value in travesty. And this is true of the image in Songs and Sonnets and to some extent in The Anniversaries. We see a pronounced difference in emphasis in the divine poetry, however. Donne describes Tilman, upon his taking orders, as some kind of miracle, a begetter of things heavenly and earthly, an hermaphrodite akin to Christ: 638 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="19">How brave are those, who with their engines, can Bring man to heaven, and heaven again to man? These are thy titles and pre-eminences, In whom must meet God's graces, men's offences, And so the heavens which beget all things here, And the earth our mother, which these things doth bear, Both these in thee, are in thy calling knit, And make thee now a blessed hermaphrodite. ("To Mr. Tilman," 47-54) The paradoxical androgyny of the virgin conception is figured in the remark in "Upon the Annunication and Passion," "She sees a cedar plant itself" (8). The religious mystery (the creation of matter from nothing; Adam as type of Christ; Eve springing from Adam; Christ born of a virgin; the death and resurrection of Christ; in- deed, the prefigurement of this in the entombment of Jonah in the belly of the whale, and his seemingly impossible renewal) is the focal point of the metaphysical interest in paradox. The story of the phoenix is one steeped in a mystery attractive as symbol, and as a figure for the poetry of Divine Weeks. Not only does the story afford the ornamentation of rhetorical device, but it stands hieroglyphically for the subject of process itself, and of form. If copulation, metaphor, Logos are equal in form, as Lawler and a host of others suggest,2' the phoenix, with its incumbent two- sexedness, and the hermaphrodite have to be regarded as indica- tors of the unity that Du Bartas explores. They are signs to be read, hieroglyphs. It is doubtless this phoenix hieroglyph that Donne has in mind in the Epithalamion, "on the Lady Elizabeth and Count Palatine being Married on St. Valentine's Day." On the one hand Donne is interested in the political process of unification put into motion by this marriage and its salvatory prospects in earthly terms.22 But he is also concerned with an almost alchemical fusion, of the sun and the moon, that in the same way as alchemy imitates the perfect love that binds base man with God. Here the phoenix as andro- gynous emblem is especially valuable. The love of Lady Elizabeth and the Count Palatine is to be the model for all future loves. Donne's source is plainly Sylvester's phoenix. The account of this mythical bird in Divine Weeks launches a long series of ency- clopedic and anthropomorphic descriptions of bird species. The phoenix becomes the model of all birdlife, and God creates all John Louis Lepage 639</page><page sequence="20">other birds as pale imitations-indeed, disciples-of the godly phoenix: The Phoenix, cutting th'unfrequented Aire, Forth-with is followed by a thousand paire Of wings, in th'instant by th'Almighty wrought, With divers Size, Colour, and Motion fraught. (5:645-48) The Colchian Pheasant, and the Partridge rare, The lustfull Sparrow, and the fruitfull Stare, The chattering Pye, the chastest Turtle-Dove, The grizell Quoist, the Thrush that Grapes doth love, The little Gnat-snap, worthy Princes Boords, And the greene Parrot, fainer of our words, Waite on the Phoenix, and admire her tunes, And gaze themselves in her blew-golden plumes. The rav'ning Kite, whose traine doth well supplie A Rudders place; the Falcon mounting high, The Marline, Lanar, and the gentle-Tercell, Th'Ospray, and Saker, with a nimble Sarcell Follow the Phoenix, from the Clouds (almost) At once discovering many an unknown Coast: (5:699-712) Donne's world of birds, on the other hand, comes first and is eclipsed by the perfect love of the princess and the count: Hail Bishop Valentine, whose day this is, All the air is thy diocese, And all the chirping choristers And other birds are thy parishioners, Thou marriest every year The lyric lark, and the grave whispering dove, The sparrow that neglects his life for love, The household bird, with the red stomacher, Thou mak'st the blackbird speed as soon, As doth the goldfinch, or the halcyon; The husband cock looks out, and straight is sped And meets his wife, which brings her feather-bed This day more cheerfully than ever shine, This day, which might enflame thyself, old Valentine. Till now, thou warmed'st with multiplying loves Two larks, two sparrows, or two doves, All that is nothing unto this, For thou this day couplest two phoenixes, Thou mak'st a taper see What the sun never saw, and what the Ark 640 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="21">(Which was of fowls, and beasts, the cage, and park,) Did not contain, one bed contains, through thee, Two phoenixes, whose joined breasts Are unto one another mutual nests, Where motion kindles such fires, as shall give Young phoenixes, and yet the old shall live Whose love and courage never shall decline But make the whole year through, thy day, 0 Valentine. Up then fair phoenix Bride, frustrate the sun, Thyself from thine affection Takest warmth enough, and from thine eye All lesser birds will take their jollity. (1-32) Donne's birds may not correspond to Sylvester's-though the "lyric lark" has something of the character of Du Bartas's lark (5:615ff.), which sings with a "tire-lire," and whose onomatopoeic song is most notably imitated by Shakespeare in Winter's Tale, 4.3.9-but the relationship is striking. Indeed, typically, Donne uses Sylvester's encyclopedia to exemplify the great chain of re- lationships perceived by Renaissance science, and as the source book for his hieroglyph of perfect love. Equal with the capacity of the hieroglyph to penetrate instruc- tively the minds and spirits of readers is its capacity to reduce to travesty, which Donne indulges to the full in the Songs and Son- nets. The duality of the metaphor is not to be ignored: one can read up from man to God; or one can read down from God to man, to appetite and copulation. Sylvester expresses the flexibility of such metaphors in a juxtaposition of Helena and Hecuba, Faustina and Lucretia, in the Second Day (each of the names rhyming and partly homonymic), and then finally in the agnominatio on "God- ling" and "Gods": Those learned Spirits, whose wits applied wrong, With wanton Charmes of their inchanting song, Make of an old, foule, frantike Hecuba, A wondrous, fresh, faire, wittie Helena: Of lewd Faustina, that loose Emperesse, A chaste Lucretia, loathing wantonnesse: Of a blind Bowe-Boy, of a Dwarfe, a Bastard, No pettie Godling, but the Gods great Maister. (1-8) These opening lines, themselves the product of a conscious "maker" of poetry, satirizing a threateningly alchemical species of John Louis Lepage 641</page><page sequence="22">poet, indulge in a rather public joke. Refusing to put the word "God" next to the profane, Cupid-like "Godling," Sylvester sub- stitutes a euphemistic periphrasis. The wordplay is parodic, for the Godling is indeed what these craftsmen devise. The fusing of Hecuba and Helen, Faustina and Lucretia, must have fascinated Renaissance sensibilities. Bacon, in the Advancement of Learning, takes up the metaphor to the same purpose: "but above all the rest, the grosse and palpable flatterie, whereunto many (not un- learned) have abased and abused their wits and pens, turning (as Du Bartas saith,) Hecuba into Helena, and Faustina into Lucretia hath most diminished the price and estimation of learning."23 The metaphorical relationship between the motivating force of love and that of lust is one that can easily abase and abuse. Du Bartas warns us that poetic artifice is a toy. And this need not be at the literal level of subject but may be at the level of hieroglyph as well. There is a genuine grain of validity in Du Bartas's warning, for we find that metaphysical poetry begins the seventeenth century by trav- estying the creative Logos as coitus, even if its motives are only the magnification of the latter and not the diminishment of the former. Sylvester cunningly demonstrates the effects of the per- version of the dignity of poetry: The'inchanting force of their sweet Eloquence Hurls headlong down their tender Audience.... (2:25-26) The moralization may not meet with our approval; nor is it just an adept use of antithesis. Du Bartas's admission of the flexibility of poetry, particularly of the dual readings of certain emblems (Hec- uba and Helen are emblems that can be read two ways: Helen is beautiful to Hecuba's ugliness but she is inconstant to Hecuba's constancy), is especially apt in the light of the incorporation of his treatment of the celestial phoenix by Donne in "The Canoniza- tion," in celebration of the coital creation of an alternate universe. Donne's phoenix lovers of the third stanza are a small creation quite distinct from the real world. In the fourth stanza only they can honor their love-death, with sonnets built in "pretty rooms": Wee can dye by it, if not live by love, And if unfit for tombes and hearse Our legend bee, it will be fit for verse; 642 Sylvester's Du Bartas</page><page sequence="23">And if no peece of Chronicle wee prove, We'll build in sonnets pretty roomes; As well a well wrought urne becomes The greatest ashes, as halfe-acre tombes, And by these hymns, all shall approve Us Canoniz'd for Love. (28-36) The rooms are obviously small by comparison with "halfe-acre tombes." The image of "pretty roomes" has often been glossed as a play on the Italian word "stanza" and the "sonnets" of line 32. Though I should not like to reject this suggestion out of hand, it seems rather more likely that Sylvester's industrious phoenix and its confined room lie behind the image: By breake of Day she builds (in narrow roome) Her Urne, her nest, her Cradle, and her Toombe: (5:611-12) The implications of this connection can be rather forbidding. If Donne's phoenix equals Sylvester's-the model for all birds-we are bound to speculate on the followers of Donne's lovers in the fifth stanza, that they owe their place in "The Canonization" to Sylvester's apostolic birds. Still, the problematic images of the third stanza of Donne's poem are indeed things of the air.24 It is perhaps still a source of discomfort to us that the devices of opposition configuring in impossible juxtapositions and related to unlikely symbols should be the basis for metaphysical represen- tations of such emotions as love. But, viewed from the window of Renaissance natural science, which regarded antithesis systemat- ically if not logically, there is profound coherence to the poetic marriage of opposites in celestial and sexual androgyny. Sylvester's Du Bartas, as a work of poetry and of science, offers an excellent view.

Geoffrey Shepherd [London, 1965], 117), "in the actions of our life who seeth not the filthiness of evil wanteth a great foil to perceive the beauty of virtue." At its farthest extreme this equation makes evil Manichean, equal with good. Evil can shine diabolically with the radiance of good- Satan's "Then evil be my good." The Bower of Bliss does resemble the Garden of Adonis; the labyrinth of evil resembles the labyrinth of good. Evil for Du Bartas is such lying eloquence. 13 A learned summary upon the famous poeme of William of Saluste Lord of Bartas, trans. Thomas Lodge (1621), 248. 14 I owe this expression to J. B.
