<plain_text><page sequence="1">A new species of Eupatorium (Asteraceae) from the Philippines Eric E. Lamont1 and Ulysses F. Ferreras2 1 The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY 10458-5126, USA; e-mail: elamont@optonline.net 2 Herbarium, Institute of Biology, University of the Philippines, Diliman, 1101, Philippines; e-mail: uferreras@yahoo.com Abstract. Eupatorium leonardii, presently known only from Mt. Mingan in the border region between Aurora and Nueva Ecija Provinces in Luzon, Philippines, is described and illustrated. The new species is remarkable because it is the only woody representative of the genus with a peculiar spiral phyllotaxy. Previously, Eupatorium s. str. consisted of herbs with opposite or verticillate phyllotaxy. Key Words: Eupatorium , Asteraceae, Philippines Flora, new species. Eupatorium L. was once a large, artificial genus of approximately 1200 species, but is now split up into numerous segregate genera (King &amp; Robinson, 1987; Funk et al., 2009). As currently circumscribed, Eupatorium is composed of 48 species of annual or peren- nial herbs from eastern North America, the West Indies in Cuba, south and east Asia, with one species (E. cannabinum L.) reaching North Africa and Europe (Bremer, 1994). Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences done by Schilling et al. (1999), Schmidt and Schilling (2000), and Ito et al. (2000a, b) have provided insight into phylogenetic rela- tionships among Eupatorieae genera and within sections of New World Eupatorium , but no sequence data has been published on any Eupatorium species from the Philippines. In the Philippines, no systematic study of Eupatorium has been conducted, nor has a complete flora been published. Historically, eight species of Eupatorium have been reported from the Philippines: E. benguetense C. Robinson, E. camiguinense Merr., E. cannabinum L. ssp. asiaticum Kitam., E. cátense Elmer, E. lindleyanum DC., E. nodi- florum Wall., E. sambucifolium Elmer, and E. toppingianum Elmer. However, the taxonom- ie status and distribution of these species have not been recently studied. Elmer (1906, 1915) considered E. toppingianum "closely related to E. sambucifolium " and noted that E. cátense was similar to but "distinct from Eupatorium sambucifolium Elm. of northern Luzon." Robinson (1908) noted morphologi- cal similarities between E. sambucifolium and E. benguetense. Koster (1935) listed E. sambucifolium and E. benguetense as syno- nyms of E. toppingianum , but King and Robinson (1987) and H. Robinson (2011, pers. comm.) recognized all three taxa as distinct species. Merrill (1912) considered E. camiguinense "manifestly allied to . . . Eupa- torium sambucifolium Elm., E. toppingianum Elm., and E. benguetense C. B. Rob., and nearer the first than to either of the others." Currently, Eupatorium cátense is usually listed as a synonym of E. camiguinense , while E. benguetense , E. camiguinense , and E. sambucifolium are considered endemic to the Philippines (King &amp; Robinson, 1987). The native status of E. cannabinum ssp. asiaticum in the Philippines is debatable. Merrill (1912) reported "a distinct northern type" of E. japonicum sensu Merr. non Thunb. [=E. cannabinum ssp. asiaticum ] "in the Philippine flora" and Ferreras (pers. obs.) reported it as established in the Philippines, but King and Robinson (1987) did not include the Philippines within the native range of E. cannabinum. Koster (1935) reported E. nodiflorum from the Philippines, but we have not seen any specimens to verify this report.

Distribution and ecology. - Eupatorium leonardii is known only from the type locality. The population consists of two individuals growing close to each other and a third growing approximately 150-200 m away. Ferreras initially suspected that addi- tional individuals might occur along the sharp-crested ridge system in the upper montane cloud forests of Mount Mingan but after an extensive, one-month field survey in 2006, and a second visit in 2010, no other individuals were located. The type locality contains several recently described, topotypic taxa including Mycaranthes leonardoi Ferreras &amp; Suarez and Diply cosia bartolomei Ferreras &amp; Argent, as well as the range-restricted Robiquetia enigma Ferreras &amp; Suarez (Ferreras &amp; Suarez, 2009; Ferreras &amp; Argent, 2011). Eupatorium leonardii was observed grow- ing in two types of habitats. The first was a sun-exposed, relatively flat site on a ridge crest leading to the summit of Mount Mingan. The dominant vegetation consisted of stunted and moss covered trees, including Leptosper- mum flavescens Sm., Podocarpus sp., Ilex paucinervia Merr., Elaeocarpus parvilimbus Merr., Astronia quadrangulata Maxw., Myr- sine sp., Loheria crassifolia (Merr.) Stone, Dacrycarpus sp., Camellia mollis (Merr.) H. T. Chang &amp; S. X. Ren, and Cleyera japónica Thunb.

The summit of Mount Mingan at 1905 m is the point of highest elevation in the Sierra Madre. Our current understanding of the flora of Mount Mingan and the immediate vicinity is based largely on the estimated total of 1200 to 1300 voucher specimens collected by R. Alvarez in 1910, M. Ramos and G. Edano in 1916, and M. Jacobs and D. Mendoza in 1968 (Co et al., 2007). An examination by Ferreras in 2010 of all Asteraceae exsiccatae deposited at the Philippine National Herbarium revealed no previous collections of E. leonardii from these earlier botanical expeditions. The prevailing climate in this region is classified as "Type IV" under the modified Corona Classification System where rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. A PAG-ASA meteorological station in Baler, Aurora, 40 km northeast of Mount Mingan, recorded an average monthly rainfall of 457 mm (PAG-ASA-IRI-LDEO Climate Library, 2011). Extreme rainfall events usu- ally occur from October to December and coincide with the arrival of tropical depres- sions, cyclonic storms, and typhoons. Occa- sionally, at least once or twice every ten years, storms with gale force winds exceeding 200 kph hit Aurora Province causing massive landslides in and around the vicinity of Mount Mingan. Conservation status and threats. - Based on the extreme rarity of this species at the type locality and considering parameters outlined in IUCN Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2001), Eupatorium leonardii can be considered Critically Endangered: CR Blab(i, ii, v), 2ab (i, ii, iii, V), Csa(i, ii). A new anthropomorphic threat to E. leonardii is posed by the increasing number of mountaineering enthusiasts who hike along ridge crest trails during attempts to scale the summit of Mount Mingan. Unrestrict- ed access to upper montane cloud forests by mountain climbers has resulted in trampling of vegetation and extensive habitat damage in many forest sites throughout the Philippines (Ferreras, pers. obs.).</page><page sequence="5">372 BRITTONIA [VOL 64 Phenology. - On the basis of two visits to Mount Mingan by Ferreras in 2006 and 2010, flowers of Eupatorium leonardii begin to open in early May and full maturity is reached by mid-June. Etymology. - The specific epithet honors Leonardo L. Co (1953-2010), a respected and revered botanist in the Philippines who dedicated his career studying Philippine plants at the remotest localities. He is best known for his untiring and unselfish mentor- ing of young Filipino botanists. Leonard died tragically after being shot by the Philippine Army while conducting field work with co- workers in the forests of Leyte. Eupatorium leonardii differs sharply from all other species of the genus because of its woody habit and peculiar spiral phyllotaxy. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences (Schilling et al., 1999) have shown that Eupa- torium must be circumscribed much more narrowly than the traditional views of Bentham (1873), B. L. Robinson (1934), and others. As circumscribed by King and Robinson (1987), Bremer (1994), and Siripun and Schilling (2006), Eupatorium s. st. includes only herba- ceous taxa with opposite or verticillate phyllo- taxy. With the discovery of E. leonardii , the morphological boundaries of the genus must be expanded. Due to the uniqueness of this species, it is not possible to indicate close relationships among the other species of Eupatorium occur- ring in the Philippines or in the New World.
