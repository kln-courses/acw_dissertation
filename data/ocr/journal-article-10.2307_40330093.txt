No. i SEPTEMBER, 1973 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS : A MILLENARIAN CULT AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE NEW GUINEA HIGHLANDS1 By M. J. Meggitt Introduction A NTHROPOLOGICAL INQUIRY in New Guinea and adjacent islands has, •^^ almost from its beginnings, devoted considerable effort and ingenuity to explaining the millenarian movements that have appeared so frequently among the indigenous peoples of the region, and some of the resulting monographs, such as those of Williams (1923), Burridge (i960), Schwartz (1962) and Lawrence (1964), are now regarded (and deservedly so) as major contributions to our understanding of chiliastic phenomena in general.2 Worsley (1957), Jarvie (1963-64) and Schwartz (1968) offer valuable analyses of this literature, so there is no need for me here to attempt another survey. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the bulk of this writing is concerned with societies of coastal and insular New Guinea. Apart from a handful of papers from Berndt (1953-54), Salisbury (1958), O'Brien and Ploeg (1964) and Strathern (1970-71), 1 The University of Sydney, the University of Michigan and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research have in turn funded my field work among the Enga ; I thank all three institutions for their generous support. Much of my work, especially that dealing with the local manifestations of Ain's cult, would have been impossible without the cordial co-operation of the then Department of District Services of the Administration of Papua and New Guinea, which not only gave me free access to official records but also approved my accompanying its patrols into what were then uncontrolled areas. I am particularly indebted to the officers leading those patrols, Phil Robb and Jack Worcester, who so cheerfully put up with the presence of an inquisitive anthropologist for long periods in difficult conditions. I thank Roy Rappaport for his critical comments on the first draft of this paper. 1 Throughout this paper I make the following distinctions : a movement is " a series of actions and endeavours of a body of persons for a special object " (Concise Oxford Dictionary) ; a millenarian movement is one whose object is to bring about certain existential changes, after which the participants (the elect) will for ever more enjoy specified benefits such as the acquisition of power, wealth, health, or happiness ; a millenarian cult is that kind of millenarian movement which emphasizes and employs religious (and magical) doctrines and rituals to explain and to achieve its purposes. A</page><page sequence="2">2 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS very little has been published about millenarian movements among the peoples of inland New Guinea. Why this paucity of material ? Is it that among the large populations in the highlands of New Guinea such movements are in fact rare ? Or is it because they occur early in the indigenes' contacts with Europeans and then dissipate, not to recur, before anthropologists have an opportunity to study them ? Either proposition, if true, would point to highly significant differences between the highlands and the coast, where chiliastic movements are both numerous and enduring, differences that in themselves would demand explanation. Or is it simply the case that, although such movements emerge often enough in the highlands, the ethnographers there have been concerned to report other kinds of field data that they take to be more pertinent to their own theoretical interests ? My own tardiness in writing the present paper certainly offers support for this last speculation. The account I now give of a millenarian cult that erupted in the 1940s among the Taro, a branch of the Enga of the Western Highlands District of Australian New Guinea, is based on material gathered mainly in 1956 during short sojourns among these and neighbouring peoples. I hope, nevertheless, that this description, despite its manifest gaps, will not have come to light too late to be of use to scholars interested in comparative research in this general subject. Moreover, I want also to take this opportunity to place on record other ethnographic data concerning a people about whom almost nothing has as yet been published. I should warn the reader that, whereas my slender ethnography of Taro society largely derives from firsthand observations, I have had to base my account of the cult itself solely on statements made by men who participated in activities that had ceased some ten years before my arrival. Finally, I should point out that my liberal use of footnotes has been deliberate. The information they contain, while germane to the account, could not be incorporated into the body of the paper without seriously impeding the flow of the narrative. Ethnography of the Taro Enga The Taro Enga, who probably number no more than about 5,000 people, occupy part of the valley of the upper Lagaipu River, which flows west to join the Strickland River, the major tributary of the Fly.3 Most of the Taro live and garden on the southern slopes of the valley, between the Kera and Misyo tributaries of the Lagaipu, but others are settled on the north side, downstream from Moko Creek.4 8 Both the Taro themselves and their Enga neighbours to the east refer to the people by this name. The Enga word taro signifies " beech tree " (Nothofagus spp.), a tree commonly found in the high montane forests of the area. 4 I remind the reader that the ethnographic present in this sketch of Taro society refers to the year 1956, " at which time the Taro domain was still part of the area regarded by the Adminis- tration as " uncontrolled ". Accordingly, no Europeans then resided permanently in Taro country, which was briefly visited several times a year by Administration patrols from the Laiagama patrol post. In i960, when Laiagama became a sub-district headquarters, the Taro region was officially considered pacified. Christian missions entered, and the rate of social and economic change increased to some extent. Nevertheless, the Taro remained largely peripheral to the centres of European influence in Enga territory. A similar pattern of relative isolation and limited social change after i960 also held for the Maramuni and the Waka Enga.</page><page sequence="3">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 3 Heavily forested and steep mountains that rise in places to over 11,000 feet above sea level mark the northern limits of the Taro domain. To the north-west are the Kewa people, who live in small, dispersed and apparently labile communities. They speak a Sepik Hills language and are culturally distinct from the Taro, who believe them to be cannibals and have little to do with them. The headwaters of the Maramuni River, a tributary of the Yuat, lie to the north-east of the Taro area. There in dense forests reside the scattered clans of Enga-speakers. These people may well be descendants of emigrants from the Mae Enga clans of the upper Ambumu valley, and they maintain close relations with the latter. The Taro have irregular but fairly frequent contacts with the Maramuni people. *\ ) ' ¿KJETCH A/0P ¿/9ÓJCÙ OaS NT \ y ™S^. *****&gt;*. ^ P/rr^oju */*** °F /0S~o&amp; \ \ Y ¿ink* To the west of the Misyo River the steep Auwakumu and Maipia mountains', (at about 9,000 feet above sea level) separate the Taro from the 5,000 or so Ipili who live in the upper Porgerà valley. The Ipili, who speak a language cognate with Enga and with Huli, are in many respects culturally intermediate between these two peoples (see Meggitt, 1957-580 and Glasse, 1968). Taro and Ipili intervisit for reasons of trade, but intermarriage is not common. Taro men assert that, because they and Ipili frequently fight over the ownership of forest pandanus trees, the theft of pigs</page><page sequence="4">4 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS and previous homicides, they do not care to risk having their sisters reside among the Ipili ; in times of warfare these women might be killed in retaliation for Taro incursions into areas claimed by the Ipili. To the south of the Taro a broad belt of high (up to 11,500 feet), rugged and uninhabited mountains separates them from the Huli of Tari in Papua (see Glasse, 1968). Such knowledge as the Taro have of the Huli comes to them mainly through their relations with the Ipili and with the Waka Enga of the Wage valley to their south-east (see Meggitt, 1956-57). No major physical obstacles restrict the intercommunication of the eastern Taro with the Yandapu Enga further up the Lagaipu valley near Laiagama or with the Paroko Enga who live along the Kera River and in turn adjoin the Waka Enga (see Meggitt, 1957-586). The western Yandapu and the Paroko may number about 10,000 people, the Waka also about 10,000. In cultural terms, it is not easy to determine where Taro clans end and those of the Yandapu and Paroko begin. The Taro have long had fairly frequent contacts with both peoples for purposes of trade, public prestations and ritual ; but warfare between them has also been common and again intermarriage is relatively limited. In its course of 15 miles or so between the Kera and Misyo junctions, the Lagaipu River falls from about 6,500 to 4,500 feet above sea level and is a boulder-strewn torrent that is difficult to cross. Topographically, the Taro domain may be divided into two parts. From the Kera junction to Muriraka (a distance of about seven or eight miles), the valley is relatively wide, enclosing some more or less level tracts of land, and the soil appears to be better suited to the traditional system of horticulture. The population there is more dense, perhaps 50 persons per square mile, and tends to be concentrated in a belt between 6,500 and 7,500 feet. Downstream from Muriraka the valley narrows and there is little flat land anywhere. The valley slopes are steeper and more accidented, and the gardens extend further up these to about 8,000 feet. The population density in this western sector is lower, perhaps 30 per square mile. There are unused, or at least uninhabited, localities, the people being clustered in pockets on the better patches of soil. Meteorological observations from Laiagama, the nearest recording station to the Taro, indicate a mean annual precipitation of 84-5 inches (the highest recorded year being 102 inches, the lowest 64 inches), with rain falling on the average of 239 days of the year. June through August are relatively dry months, with an average rainfall of 2-3 to 4-4 inches. All of these figures are considerably (20% to 30%) lower than those recorded at Wabag in Mae Enga territory to the east (C.S.I.R.O., 1965 : 58). The staple crop of the Taro is sweet potato, grown in mounds in well tilled gardens under the system of swiddening and long fallowing common to most Enga. Indigenous varieties of sweet potatoes take up to twelve months to mature, but varieties intro- duced since the coming of the Europeans need less time and give greater yields, characteristics keenly appreciated by the Taro. Taro plants of inferior quality and low yield are raised, mainly near the river banks. Yams do not grow at all.</page><page sequence="5">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 5 Indigenous sugarcane is limited both in quality and quantity, and the cultivated varieties of nut pandanus so common further east do not thrive here. The Taro are largely dependent on the less prolific wild varieties in the forests for this significant source of vegetable protein. Introduced Irish potatoes are nowadays (1956) an important standby, frost-resistant cropland the Taro have added shallots, cabbages and maize to the traditional supplements of beans, setaria, rungia, solanums and other greens. In general, and despite their relative freedom from the winter frosts that so frequently damage the sweet potato crops of many of the Yandapu Enga living at higher altitudes, the Taro gardens appear to be much less productive than those of the Enga to their east. Taro men also assert this, saying that food shortages are common here, and they ascribe these failures to the poor soil.6 According to them, a newly made garden produces on the average only one reasonably good crop of sweet potatoes. The tubers of the next crop, they say, are so small as to be fit only for pigs. After that harvest the red clay is visible through the topsoil and the plot must lie fallow until the original gardener's son thinks it is again ready for cultivation ; that is, the land requires a fallow period of anything from 15 to 25 years as compared with the cycles of one to 10 years observed among the Mae Enga. Obviously, each local Taro group needs a relatively large area of land on which to maintain itself. The Taro raise pigs, which are mainly reserved for use in rituals and in sporadic public prestations, so that pork is not a common item of daily diet.6 Chickens are few. However, the Taro, to a much greater extent than the central Enga, have access to game (cassowaries, feral pigs, tree kangaroos, possums and other small marsupials) in the extensive forests that abut their gardens. Despite the acquisition since the early 1950s of steel axes and machetes in native trade and from Adminis- tration patrols, the demand of the relatively sparse population in the area for fresh garden land, firewood and building materials has as yet (1956) had little noticeable effect on the forest cover. In broad terms, the social structure and organization of the Taro resemble those of the Mae Enga, albeit they appear to be rather less complex. The differences may perhaps stem from the smaller total population and the lower population densities of the Taro (compare Meggitt, 1956-57, 19650). The Taro are members of named groups which they themselves equate with the patrilineal clans of the Enga to their east. In at least two instances pairs of clans * Mr. James Brugh, who was mining gold in the Porgerà valley in the late 1940's and the 1950's, travelled through Taro territory a number of times with his lines of carriers. He also informed me that shortages of sweet potatoes seemed to him to be more common there than in Enga areas to the east. • Taro men told me that the local herds of pigs had still (1956) not fully recovered from the epidemic of " shortwind " (probably bacterial pneumonia, see below) that had swept in from the east in the 1940's. Moreover, there had recently been a fresh outbreak of the anthrax that seems to be endemic in the region. Since the 1 goo's the Taro herds have benefited from interbreeding with varieties of pigs introduced to the Laiagama area by the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries and by the missions.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS are held to be " brothers ", their putative founders being regarded as sons of the eponymous founders of the phratry that each pair comprises. Such named phratries do not have any obvious social functions or tasks, and there is no suggestion that the component clans are in any kind of balanced or complementary opposition. Each Taro clan, named for its putative founder, is made up of several named sub-groups, the eponymous founders of which are usually said to be the sons of the clan founder. Of four clans that I have investigated, one has three sub-clans, one has four, one has five, and one has seven. Two of the sub-clans of the last clan bear the names of putative daughters of the clan founder, and the men of these sub-groups are referred to as wananye, " sisters' sons " of the clan ; this appellation, however, does not appear to make any difference to their jural or ritual status in the clan. How widespread this pattern of " attached " sub-clans is I do not know, nor did I discover whether sub-clans are further divided into the equivalent of central Enga patrilineages. Members of the clans of one named phratry may and do intermarry. Clans, however, are ideally exogamous and, in a sample of 89 Taro marriages that I noted, only two are intra-clan. Although the rules of exogamy are phrased in terms of clan membership, and although clans are also important in warfare and ritual, the sub-clans appear to be the significant local units. In some cases two sub-clans of the same clan share (that is, garden in) the one named locality, but usually each sub-clan has its own named gardening and residential domain separated from others of that clan by dense bush. Occasionally the sub-clan territories may be five miles or more apart on opposite sides of the Lagaipu River. Within the sub-clan domain the people live in scattered homesteads, whose situation is largely determined by the location of current gardens and sources of potable water, as well as by considerations of privacy and of defense. Married women and their young sons and unwed daughters occupy separate houses ; small groups of related men live in houses that are male social centres as well as dwellings. Boys join their fathers in these houses when they are about seven or eight years old. Given that the inheritance of gardening and residential rights to land in a sub-clan territory is ideally by and through men, at least patrifilially if not patrilineally, one would expect each sub-clan parish group to comprise a core of men who are actual or putative agnates (tiwinggi), together with their wives and widows (imanggi), and their children (also tiwinggi) (compare Meggitt, 1956-57, 1963-64). However, there may also be present a substantial percentage of other people who have access to this land for long or short terms. These normally fall into two main categories - sisters' husbands or daughters' husbands (imanggi) and their families, and fathers' sisters' sons or sisters' sons (wananye) and their families. The former are men who for various reasons have chosen to live with their wives' agnates and to participate fully in the economic activities of the latter. The wananye are often men whose fathers have died when they were children and who have returned with their mothers to live on land granted them by their mothers' brotheis or fathers. The sons of the co-resident affines (imanggi), if they remain as functioning members of the host parish, not only</page><page sequence="7">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 7 become sisters' sons (wananye) but may also cultivate the land used there by their fathers. In any case the children of co-resident sisters' sons inherit their fathers' rights and are regarded as agnates (tiwinggi). The composition of one Taro sub-clan parish I censussed affords an example of these arrangements. The sub-clan's territory covers about four square miles.

The Taro recognition of the claims that a man may make on his mother's brother or mother's father for usufructuary and residential privileges in land is but a specific instance of the general pattern found among Enga wherein, through maternal filiation, the rights and obligations of a person's matrilateral kin are clearly defined and set off against those of his or her agnates (see Meggitt, 1965a : chap. 7). A child receives its flesh and blood, its corporeal vitality, from its mother and depends on her for the nurture that lays the basis for its survival as an adult. The main danger thought to face the individual in an uncertain world is illness and death ultimately caused by the malice of the ghosts of his (her) close agnates, especially of the ghost of the father, the man through whose clan membership the child acquired its spiritual vitality (see Meggitt, 1956-57, 1965Ò). Thus, when a person is injured, falls ill, or dies, the men of the mother's natal sub-clan, whose blood the victim in a sense shares and who have an interest in his or her physical welfare, hold responsible the men of the latter's sub-clan for failing to protect their sister's child, and they demand and receive material compensation (latta pinggi). This, then, is the rationale of the continual round of prestations among Enga individuals and agnatic groups that concern insult, accident, illness and death - one which appears to hold also among the Taro.</page><page sequence="8">8 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS Important, too, is the fact that such payments of compensation are always public and thus serve epideictic functions, enabling individuals and groups to display their wealth and strength and to enhance their prestige. In consequence the amounts given are not fixed ; rather they vary according to circumstances such as the status of the deceased, the current wealth of his or her agnates, and the existing relationships between the donors and recipients. For instance, the death compensation paid to matrilateral kin of each of two married Taro men was five pigs and ten pigs ; for each of three Taro children it was four, five and seven pigs. Such compensation of matrilateral kin also occurs when a person dies in or as a result of warfare, or is murdered. It is to be distinguished from the homicide compensation (tepinggi) that the killer's agnates make publicly to the victim's agnates. In these cases among central Enga one clan (rather than a sub-clan) gives to another, and this seems to be true also of Taro Enga. At any rate, Taro homicide compensa- tions are on the average larger than the death payments made to matrilateral kin. Thus, the clan of one married man killed in battle received 50 pigs from the killer's group, whereas the homicide compensation for two bachelors was 10 pigs each and for a spinster 20 pigs. Normally, the victim's sub-clan makes the death compensation to maternal kin of the deceased after it has received the homicide payment. Marriage, which is in effect the event that begins these chains of prestations, is also marked by public distributions of wealth among the Taro. Although Taro men are as uneasy as are other Enga men about sexual contact with women and fear the potentially polluting effects of menstrual blood (see Meggitt, 1964), polygyny is nevertheless the explicit ideal. Most men strive to acquire several wives each in order (1) to secure the female labour necessary to care for the gardens and pigs on which an individual's wealth is based, (2) to have many children of whom the sons provide economic and military support, whereas the daughters bring in wealth through bride price, and (3) to establish through affinal connections as wide a range of exchange relationships as possible so that the individual can employ his wealth to the best effect. Taro girls first marry when they are in their mid to late 'teens, men when they are in their late twenties. This age discrepancy, by defining a larger pool of marriage- able females than of males, in fact facilitates the occurrence of polygyny. Thus, a sample of 49 Taro husbands has 71 current wives, an average of 1 -4 wives per married man. Of these men, nine have two wives each, five have three, and one has four. The 71 wives, incidentally, have a total of 135 surviving children. One reason for the relatively late age at which the men marry (apart from their sexual worries) may be the size of the bride price normally required (see Table 2). A young man cannot easily on his own behalf amass the number of pigs required for the bride price, and his agnates and other relatives are reluctant to assist him in this venture until he has demonstrated through several years of participation in public prestations that he is a good exchange investment. Similarly, the kinsmen of a girl require this kind of information before they let her go in marriage, because they too</page><page sequence="9">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 9 want the union to establish enduring and profitable exchange connections with the husband and his agnates. The details of Taro marriage transactions appear to resemble closely those of the Mae Enga, albeit the occasions may well be on a smaller scale and less complex (see Meggitt, 1965a : chap. 5). The groom's family, assisted by other close agnates and relatives, hand over the bride price agreed upon in several instalments to the bride's family. The latter then make the smaller return gift of pigs. This is not a dowry - the bride has no effective control over its disposition. Once the return gift pigs are Tablb 2 Sample of Taro Bride Prices and Return Gifts (1956) Approximate Occasion Number Other Date of Pigs Valuables (a) 1936 . . . . b.p. 10 ? 1941 . . . . b.p. 10 ? rg. 3 o 1946 . . . . b.p. 10 2 r.g. 2 o 1950 .. .. b.p. 5 1 r.g. o (bride a widow) 1952 . . . . b.p. 1 2 r.g. 1 o 1953 •• .. t&gt;-P- 6 3 r.g. 1 o 1954 •• •• bP- 8 * rg. 5 o b.p. 10. ? r.g. 4 ° 1956 . . . . b.p. 7 3 r.g. 1 o Mean pigs, b.p. = 7 '4.

Any subsequent attempt to dissolve the union is a divorce and is strongly opposed by both sets of relatives, who now have a vested interest in maintaining the exchange relationships set up between the groups by the marriage. I have only one divorce recorded in the sample of Taro genealogies I collected, that of a relatively important polygynist who sent his third wife back to her parents soon after the marriage and retrieved the bride pride. I do not know the reason for his action. Taro marriage rules closely resemble those of the Mae Enga (see Meggitt, 1965a : chap. 4). They emphasize sub-clan and clan exogamy, and in a sample of 89 recorded marriages only two have been made within the clan. In addition, a man should not marry into the sub-clans of his mother, of his mother's sisters' husbands, and of his father's sisters' husbands, although he may marry women of other sub-clans of those</page><page sequence="10">io THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS clans. I have found two cases of men married to women of the husbands' mothers' sub-clans. A man may wed the sister of his late wife, and there are three such unions in my sample ; he should not, however, marry the sister of a living wife and I have encountered no such cases, although one Taro man has taken two living wives from one sub-clan. The reason for all of these prohibitions appears to be that common among other Enga, namely, a disinclination to use bride price to establish further affinal connections with groups of people with whom exchange relationships already exist. Such actions are thought to waste limited exchange resources. With respect to the remarriage of widows, there is ideally a form of the levirate in that the woman should not remarry outside her later husband's sub-clan unless no man in it offers for her. If the widow has children, the agnates of her late husband are likely to make some effort to keep her and the offspring in their group ; but in general, to judge from my sample (admittedly small), such leviratic unions do not appear to outnumber extra-group remarriages of widows. Some older widows with children do not remarry at all but remain under the protection of close agnates of their late husbands. In leviratic marriages there seems to be considerable variability in the pattern of exchanges of bride price and return gift. Some Taro men say that there is no need to offer another bride price to the widow's natal group ; others state that a token bride price should be offered (especially if the woman is young), with no expectation of a return gift. An ambitious man who is aiming to make his name widely known, however, may offer a full bride price to the widow's agnates and demand a return gift as well. In any case, if the widow's children are older than about eight or ten years, the leviratic husband is likely to make a gift (perhaps of a pig each) to them. This passes into their mother's possession and appears to be a douceur to induce her to remain and so keep the children in the group of their late father. Should the widow (especially if she is relatively young and has children) go to a man outside her late husband's group, he is likely to give a new bride price (about as much as for an unwed bride) to her agnates and at the same time make a token gift to the agnates of the dead man. The latter largely depends on whether he is on good terms with them or has an exchange partner among them. Whatever the arrange- ments made, it seems that the children of a widow who remarries outside her late husband's group are likely to be incorporated into the group of the new husband. This may well reflect the likelihood that the latter can readily provide the incomers with sufficient land for their future needs, because of the general abundance of land relative to the sparse Taro population. Religious beliefs and activities among the Taro have much in common with those encountered among other Enga and among the Ipili (see Meggitt, 1956-57, 1957-580, 19656) . There is, first of all, the same basic assumption that all people are descendants of the one father and mother, the male sun and the female moon. This couple had many offspring (the sky or originating people, te akali=yalyakali), some of whom ultimately left their celestial domain to settle in specific localities in the Taro area where they became the eponymous founders of present-day social groups (phratries</page><page sequence="11">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS n or, in some cases, clans).7 The terrestrial social system, together with the content of Taro culture, is seen as a reflection (perhaps isomorphic) of that which the sky people still maintain above. The sky people (including the sun and the moon) continue to control meteorological events such as droughts and flooding rains that affect the Taro, and apparently in some sense they are the final arbiters of the fates of individual mortals in that they (in an obscure manner) determine whether a man will live long or die young, achieve success or suffer failure in important social activities. Nevertheless, although contemporary men may divine their own futures, they can do little to influence the sky people to act for good or ill in everyday affairs.8 In the ordinary round of Taro life, the good and bad fortune of a man or woman, to the extent that they are not attributed to that individual's personal qualities or capacities (and in this respect most Enga appear very much to be imbued with some- thing approaching the Protestant ethic), are explained primarily in terms of the actions of spirits of the dead and, to a lesser degree, of the human performance of magic and sorcery. As far as I can tell, the Taro theory of ghosts is largely that of eastern Enga, so I shall deal with it only briefly (see Meggitt, 19656). Enga generally believe that every person while alive possesses (that is, has within him- or herself) an individual spirit or breath that at death becomes an active and highly mobile ghost capable of attacking the close surviving kin of the deceased. The Mae Enga emphasize and fear the malevolence of ghosts ; they attribute most injuries, illnesses and deaths to ghostly interventions and they employ a variety of rituals to ascertain and if possible to assuage the pernicious intentions of these entities. Western Enga (including Waka and Taro), as well as the neighbouring Ipili, however, take a more lenient view of ghosts in that, depending on circumstances, they impute both malevolent and benevolent attitudes to them. Thus, whereas the Mae try to avoid all contact with their dead, western Enga frequently express less fear of the ghosts of their dead kin. Families may keep the skulls and jawbones of deceased members in or near their dwellings in the hope that the ghosts will warn them of impending dangers and assist them in various enterprises such as inter-group warfare and distributions of valuables. Should the particular ghost fail to help the head of the family when invoked or should the family suffer misfortunes that a diviner or medium ascribes to the malice of that ghost, the bones are buried with the rest of the corpse, and the family turns to the ghost of another recently deceased member for aid. Nevertheless, on balance it seems that recent ghosts among the Taro are more often dangerous than they are helpful, and the people know and use much the same range of rituals as do central Enga to propitiate them or to force them to desist from 7 The names attributed to at least three of these putative founders of groups were homonymous with Enga floral terms, e.g., the name for cane grass (Miscanthus sp.). However, such eponymy does not seem to have any totemic implications, in which respect it resembles the usages of the Waka Enga clans to the south-east (see Meggitt, 1956-57). 8 Given my limited contact with the Taro, I may here be underestimating both the effective intervention of the sky-beings in the people's daily life and the extent to which the latter think about these entities.</page><page sequence="12">12 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS attacking closely related survivors. Indeed, Taro and Waka Enga employ some rituals that the Mae do not have, rituals that they appear to have acquired from the Ipili and, indirectly, from the Huli. For instance, karae pinggi, thought by Taro to have come from the Ipili further west, is performed at night when a man is seriously ill. His " brothers " erect a large rectangular hut with open sides and set up a slender pole about eight feet high within it. A ritual expert kills a pig belonging to the victim and, as blood drips from its snout into a cooking fire near the post, offers the beast (or, more accurately, the "smell" and essence of its blood) as roma singgi to the ghost thought to have attacked (" bitten ") the spirit of the man. While the butchered pig cooks in the earth oven, male relatives sit on one side of the hut, women and children on the other. Two men, with brightly painted faces and soot-blackened torsos, appear. They wear layers of women's skirts and adorn their heads and chests with many cassowary-plume ornaments.9 They dance round and round the post, hopping sideways as they beat drums until the pork is cooked. Neither they nor the audience sing. A side of the pork is set aside to be given to the close paternal kin of the victim's mother, and the assembled company eats the remainder of the pig. If this kind of domestic propitiation of the ghost fails to improve the patient's condition, or if more people fall ill, the members of the local group may decide that several recent ghosts are responsible. They then turn to certain old men among them to ascertain what ritual to use in order to alleviate the situation. The old men go into seclusion for two or three days in a house hidden in the bush. Each morning they look at the rising sun and experience a fit of shaking (taripa pinggi) that passes into a trance-like state, during which they look for signs to indicate the appropriate ritual to be performed by the local group. One such ritual, koto pinggi, seems to be an elaboration of a widely practised but simpler " ghost-spearing " technique (nea pinggi) of the central Enga.10 The affected members of the group contribute valuables (not pigs) to pay for the services of a koto expert, who is called in from abroad (for instance, from the Ipili or the Huli). He tells the men of the victims' families to donate pigs (perhaps two each) for the ritual. That night all the women and children remain in a woman's house while the decorated men prepare an earth oven outside. The koto specialist goes alone into the men's house, where he makes and bespells a stout " spear " about four feet long, to which he attaches three prongs. At dawn the donors of the pigs assemble outside the men's house and, at a signal from the expert, each kills each of his pigs with one blow of his club as the specialist dedicates the animals to the ghosts that the donors • Given the general Enga notions of female pollution, I assume these are new skirts, that is, not yet contaminated by women's emanations. 10 For nea pinggi, close agnates of a sick man or child (or of the husband of a sick woman) engage a specialist diviner who makes and bespells a pair of pointed wooden tongs about two feet long. He dedicates a pig as a roma singgi offering to the ghost thought to be causing the illness. A kinsman of the victim clubs the pig so that the blood from its snout runs into the oven pit. As the ghost, attracted by the dedication and by the smell of the blood, enters the pit, the specialist vigorously stabs the tongs through the ghost and into the earth, twisting them so that the points snap off in the oven. The ghost, simultaneously mollified by the offering and intimidated by the " spearing ", abandons its attack on the victim and flees - at least temporarily.</page><page sequence="13">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 13 believe are causing their troubles. He arranges the pigs in a stellate pattern around the fireplace of the men's house so that their snouts touch and their blood mingles. Attracted by the " smell " of the blood and by the dedications, the ghosts gather in the fireplace. Crooning spells, the expert steals up to the fireplace and drives the " spear " into the pool of blood. He uses an oven stone to hammer down the " spear " until the butt is flush with the ashes and then he places his mouth over the butt and blows and speaks spells into it. The " spear " and the spells act together to pierce the eyes of the ghosts so that, for the time being at least, they cannot see their victims to injure them further. The expert returns the pigs to their owners, who take them home for cooking, and he then lights a fire on top of the " spear ", which remains permanently in the fireplace. Later the men bring the cooked pork to the public dance ground for general distribution to their relatives, including the maternal kin of the victims. The specialist receives as extra payment for his services the guts, ears and snouts of the pigs, plus a side of pork. Individual ghosts do not, however, continue indefinitely to trouble their surviving close relatives. As time passes and the latter die (" killed " in whatever manner by recent ghosts), their ghosts in turn are active and the original ghosts become part of the anonymous collectivity of ancestral ghosts or spirits that the local descent group has been amassing through the generations since the death of its founder. The Taro, like the central and other fringe Enga, believe that, although the power or influence of the corpus of ancestral spirits can on occasion pervade the whole of each local descent group's territory, the spirits themselves are concentrated in specific localities within that territory (see Meggitt, 1956-57, 1965Ò). Thus, in some cases, a clan or a set of fraternal clans possesses a number of portable and curiously shaped stones, usually called " eggs of the sun " and sometimes " eyes of the sun ", which the clan or phratry founder brought with him from the sky world or which subsequent ancestors found on earth in remarkable circumstances. These stones are normally kept buried within a grove of trees (often thought to have been planted by the ancestors) distant from the habitation and gardening centres of the group members, who in the ordinary way take care to avoid such sites for fear of the displeasure of or attacks by the ancestors resident, in the stones. Among other clans, the ancestral spirits are thought to dwell in a freshwater pool or pond hidden in the montane forest claimed by each group. These ancestors may manifest themselves to the appropriate ritual experts in the form of a huge snake that sleeps under the water until it is disturbed. Naturally, people avoid these pools during their everyday activities. In a few cases, a clan or set of clans may have both stones and pools, between which, presumably, the ancestors of the group commute. By and large the ancestral spirits remain quiescent in such localities and in doing so enable the living members of the local group to pursue uninterrupted their quotidian round. But, when a major misfortune besets the whole group, as for instance a series of human or porcine deaths, a crop failure, or an ignominious military defeat, men argue that the calamity is an expression of the anger of the ancestral spirits en masse (rather than of the expected malice of an individual ghost) because of some dereliction</page><page sequence="14">14 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS on the part of their living descendants. The people's fault may lie in their ineptness in carrying out an inter-group exchange of valuables that would magnify their own group's name, or in failing to defend the group's resources (for instance, pigs or pandanus nuts) against the raids of other groups, or merely in omitting to " feed " (by offering pigs and game) the ancestors over too long a period. Whatever reason is hit upon in public discussion among the men, their leaders, the Big Men, make arrangements to call in one or more ritual specialists to determine and to direct the appropriate measures for pacifying the ancestors. Sometimes the clan or group of clans has its own spell-man ; sometimes it must invite one from another Taro clan or even from the Ipili to the west, people who have a well-founded reputation for ritual expertise. In all cases the group pays handsomely in pork, salt and other valuables for the services of the specialist. The rituals performed to assuage the anger of the ancestors vary considerably from one specialist to another and from group to group (especially between those groups with stones and those with pools), but they all emphasize one central feature - the killing of pigs or game animals and the offering of the cooked meat or fat to the ancestors, who consume the essence of the gift (which may reside in the grease, blood, or smell) and leave the material part to be distributed among the participants, including the specialists, visiting relatives and exchange partners. In general, these rituals as described by Taro men to me (I have not seen them performed) appear basically to resemble those of the Enga to their east but with a certain Ipili overlay (see Meggitt, 1956-57, 1957-580, 19656). n Certainly they are characteristically Enga in their stress on a here and now quid pro quo, on the notion of bargaining with and buying off the ancestors as one would deal with somewhat larger than lif e kinsmen or neighbours in order to repair a damaged social relationship and to extract some benefit from the situation (in this case a return to the desirable status quo ante in which the aroused and malevolent ancestors are persuaded to withdraw into quiet repose in their bounded locations and so let people go about their ordinary business of living). Early Contacts of the Taro with Europeans In 1956 the Taro area was still, by Administration definition, restricted or uncontrolled territory and, with respect to contemporary European influences, was very much an isolated backwater. For some years Administration officers had made brief patrols there (about twice each year on the average) ; and during the 11 Among the Yandapu Enga of the upper Lagaipu River to the east of the Taro some, but not all, descent groups possess anthropomorphic, ithyphallic figures (each about three feet tall and made from woven fibre) called Yupini. Such objects, which are kept in secluded cult houses, appear to embody the ancestral spirits of the particular clans or phratries and are employed in rituals designed to propitiate these ancestors. Thus, when pigs or other animals are killed in the ritual, their fat is rubbed on the figure's mouth so that the ancestors may eat the essence of the offering. These figures are clearly analogous to the bark plaques painted with human shapes and to the human skulls that some Enga clans use in propitiation rituals to represent their ancestors, and they may perhaps be related to the old red ochre paintings of three men in full Enga ceremonial regalia that I observed in 1956 on a limestone outcrop near Kepilyama on the upper Lagaipu. I do not know whether Taro Enga also use Yupini figures in their ancestral cults, but given their proximity to and connections with the Yandapu, they may well do so.</page><page sequence="15">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 15 1950s two or three European prospectors from time to time travelled along the Lagaipu valley, going to and from their small gold-mining leases in the Porgerà valley to the west. No other Europeans were as yet permitted to reside in the area. Conse- quently, it is difficult to put together more than a sketch of the earlier history of European and Taro contacts and of the events that led to the genesis of Ain's millenarian cult. The first European contacts with Enga for which we have indubitable evidence occurred as part of the series of explorations by gold prospectors (mainly from Australia) of the New Guinea highlands that began in the late 1920s. Thus in 1930 a party of five prospectors, working for the Akmana Company, together with carriers travelled from the Sepik River via the Karawari to the upper Maramuni and Tarua rivers, where for some weeks they engaged in brisk trading with local Enga while unsuccessfully seeking deposits of gold (see Shepherd, 1971). In 1934 the Leahy brothers walked from Mount Hagen up the Lai and Ambumu valleys to about 20 miles west of the present site of Wabag, before illness and the frequent attacks of central Enga groups forced them to turn back (see Leahy and Crain, 1937). In the same year the Schmidts (father and son) prospected from Mount Hagen to the Jimi and Maramuni valleys, murdering local natives right and left before they travelled on to the north coast of New Guinea. There Administration officers arrested them for their crimes and Schmidt pére was subsequently hanged in Rabaul (see Souter, 1963 : 186-87). Also in 1934 the Fox brothers prospected unsuccessfully from Mount Hagen westwards along the northern (Sepik) slopes of the central ranges at least as far as the Strickland River and perhaps even to the border of Dutch New Guinea. They returned to Mount Hagen via the Tari basin along the southern slopes of the ranges (see Leahy and Crain, 1937 : 270 ; Fox and Fox, 1936 ; Souter, 1963: 187-88). From the exiguous details recorded in the published account of the journey of the Fox brothers it is not possible to determine whether in fact they walked through the territory of the Taro Enga. If they did not do so, they must have passed close to it on the north. Although the Akmana party and that of the Schmidts did not enter Taro country, they did encounter Maramuni Enga, who traditionally traded with the Taro some 30 or 40 miles across the mountains to the south-west. It is likely, then, that news of the passage of Europeans, strange red-skinned creatures laden with valuables and possessing guns and gelignite,12 would soon have reached the Taro, especially as a consequence of the bloody depredations of the Schmidts. By 1956, however, it was clear that the knowledge of Taro men of these earlier movements of Europeans had become conflated with what they knew of European » By and large, relations between the Maramuni Enga and the Akmana party during their brief sojourn seem to have been amicable ; the former were eager to exchange foodstuffs for steel implements and other European commodities. However, at one point the Enga stole considerable quantities of supplies from the Akmana base camp and, in order to recover these, the prospectors made a show of force that included rapid fire from rifles and the detonation of charges of gelignite. Apparently there were no Enga casualties but the people, impressed by the noise and smoke, quickly surrendered the stolen objects. Friendly intercourse, including trade, was later resumed (Shepherd, 1971)-</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS visitors of the late 1930s and early 1940s. I found it impossible to put these men's accounts into any sensible temporal order. In view of the discouraging reports from these early prospectors, none of whom found gold in payable quantities in Enga territory, there was no more exploration of this region until 1938, when the Administration established a permanent patrol post with a tiny airstrip near Mount Hagen. From here in that year the Administration officers Taylor and Black began their remarkable patrol which lasted 15 months and during which they visited many Enga localities, including that of the Taro (see Taylor, 1940). Their party was large by New Guinea standards, at times comprising 20 native police and over 200 carriers bearing a great array of European equipment and foodstuffs. In addition they cleared an airstrip at Wabag, from which small aircraft made several flights in order to survey as yet untravelled country (such as that of the Taro) and to drop supplies to the patrol at various stages of its progress. Although the Enga and the intruders clashed violently several times (notably near Wabag, where a major Enga attack was repulsed with casualties on both sides), relations between them were on the whole amicable ; for instance, Black's brief patrol along the Lagaipu valley into Taro territory was apparently without incident. It is clear that all aspects of the Europeans and their entourage (for instance, their very appearance, their puzzling activities in mapping the terrain, sending radio messages and the like, their multitudinous possessions, their weapons, their use of aircraft, the discipline of their squad of police) combined to make a deep impression on the Enga, who quickly came to regard the Europeans either as visitors from the celestial world or, less commonly, as reincarnations of ancestral spirits from the terrestrial world (see Taylor, 1940 : 142). Either view was, of course, eminently reasonable in the light of Enga religious beliefs and cosmology ; and the very presence of these Europeans (no matter how short their sojourns), was a powerful, albeit circu- lar, verification of the validity of such views.18 With the completion of the Hagen-Sepik patrol in 1939, the Administration abandoned the post at Wabag. Taylor's report indicated that no payable deposits of gold had been found west of Hagen, thus confirming the experience of the earlier explorers there, and for some years afterwards prospectors ignored the area. I do not know if, during the years immediately following the removal of the Wabag post, the Administration officers from Mount Hagen continued to patrol Enga territory. By 1940 Australia was becoming deeply involved in the war against Germany, and a number of officers of the Administration of the Territory of New Guinea joined the military forces for service elsewhere, thus making it difficult for the Administration 11 European explorers in other parts of the highlands reported similar responses from the peoples they encountered (see, for instance, Chinnery, 1934 : 4°9 I Leahy and Crain, 1937 : 159 ; Taylor, 1940 : 143 f.). Indeed, the conviction of central Enga that Europeans were yalyakali, immortal " causal people " visiting from the sky-world, was not seriously shaken until 1951, when a small aeroplane crashed at Wapenamanda and all of its occupants, including the Assistant District Officer, were killed. As late as 1955, when I began my field work among the Mae Enga, many older men still insisted that Europeans were transient sky-people, whose failure to perform their proper meteorological functions in the world above was responsible for such terrestrial difficulties as the recent poor yields of pandanus nuts.</page><page sequence="17">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 17 to maintain its never very extensive field activities in the central highlands, let alone to expand them. The Japanese invasions of northern New Guinea in 1942 changed the situation. Early in 1942 the Australian Government replaced the civilian administrations of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea with a single military command and set up the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit to function as its civil arm ; many of the members of ANGAU were former Administration officers. One task of ANGAU was to maintain an east-west line of communications through the highlands, based on existing or newly established patrol posts and small airstrips. This chain of posts was intended to act as a first line of warning and defence if Japanese troops attempted to move from the northern coast into the mountains. Although never put to this test, the highlands line was important in providing an escape route for the civilians (mainly planters and missionaries) and Australian troops cut off in various coastal pockets by the Japanese advance. Given Japanese superiority, then, in the air and at sea, these refugees had no choice but to try to make their way on foot inland through the swamps and rain forests and up into the mountains. For people caught in the Sepik area, for instance, one of the best ways out was to the south-east via the Karawari or Yuat valleys to Wabag. In consequence, in 1942 or 1943 ANGAU officers re-established a patrol post at Wabag and also set up posts manned by native police at localities east and west of Wabag. To keep open the line of communication the ANGAU officers regularly patrolled between Mount Hagen and Wabag and also further west to Sirungki, some 15 or 20 miles from Taro territory. I do not know how many pai ties of refugees used the Sepik- Wabag escape route, but certainly several did in 1943, some coming up the Maramuni, others up the Lagaipu through or near Taro country. Brief and somewhat guarded references in patrol reports of the time indicate that on occasion conflicts broke out between the refugees and local people over thefts of food and pigs and assaults on women. Moreover, similar confrontations occurred between Enga and the inadequately supervised native police occupying the outlying posts, culminating in an unsuccessful attack by Yandapu Enga on the Sirungki police post.14 The senior ANGAU officer then in command at Wabag dealt harshly with such " riotous behaviour ", as well as with any other expressions of Enga exuberance such as their beheading of one of his interpreters. Indeed, even in the late 1950s the Mae Enga in whose territory he was most active still ruefully recalled his treatment of them. Spectacular as such collisions between Enga and Europeans may have been at the time, they do not in retrospect seem to have been felt as especially traumatic or significant by the Enga, largely, I believe, because they were fully compatible with Enga notions of the propriety of inter-group warfare, murder and general violence, including arson. Such behaviour was (and is) in their view a wholly acceptable way of dealing with enemies if one can get away with it. 14 This was not an isolated incident. Down the Lai valley to the east of Wabag, Laiapu Enga attacked the police at the Birip post, and in the Sau valley a series of armed assaults by Saui Enga forced an Australian Army radio unit to abandon its post permanently. B</page><page sequence="18">i8 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS During this period, the early 1940s, there were, however, other events that markedly affected the Enga, including those like the Taro who still had relatively little contact with Europeans, events that persuaded them that the times were indeed out of joint, that traditional and trusted responses to calamities were no longer as efficacious as before. The first was the great meteorological upset of 1940 or 1941, when much of the Enga region (especially the higher western parts) was gripped by the coldest winter in memory. Normally, Enga are able to grow their staple crop of sweet potatoes, which are vulnerable to frosts, up to altitudes of about 8,000 to 8,500 feet above sea level ; in a very few favoured locations the plants can survive some winters as high as 9,000 feet.15 On this occasion there were days of sleet at high altitudes (and perhaps also snow on the crests of the ranges) that killed sweet potatoes and other supplementary food plants ; pigs and game also suffered. Frosts then persisted for days, perhaps weeks, and destroyed sweet potato gardens situated as low as 6,000 to 6,500 feet. A long spell of dry weather followed to complete the damage. People in the higher clan territories scavenged " like wild pigs " for food in the bush, while at the same time they performed the usual rituals to propitiate their ancestral spirits as well as the sky people. These measures had little discernible effect, and Enga were forced to migrate temporarily in considerable numbers to the lower valleys to call on relatives and exchange partners for succour. Some refugees died en route, apparently of exposure. The valley groups, themselves hard pressed by food shortages, had in some cases to resort to arms to protect their gardens and pigs from such incursions. In general, however, the reluctant hosts were able to support their hungry visitors after a fashion until conditions improved sufficiently for the latter to plant and harvest emergency gardens in their home territories. Informants' accounts of this whole episode indicated that one important consequence was the degree to which it shook the trust of the uplands peoples in some of their own rituals and, in doing so, left them more ready to consider new alternatives. The daily life of the Enga had scarcely recovered from these misfortunes when, in 1943, the people began to experience some of the indirect effects of the war in the Pacific. The substantial and rapid movements of military units (Australian and American) and native personnel from the coast into the eastern highlands facilitated the spread of certain diseases. The opening by ANGAU officers and native police of the line of communications between Mount Hagen and Wabag was followed in 1943 by a serious outbreak of influenza that killed some Enga, especially the very young and the very old. At about the same time an epidemic of dysentery that had been steadily moving westwards through the highlands entered the Enga area and affected even those peripheral clans that had few, if any, dealings with the foreigners.16 15 The runners of the sweet potato, which when it is mature cover the garden in a dense carpet, are succulent. One night of frost can freeze the sap in the runners, causing it to expand and rupture the plant's tissues. When the sun melts the ice, the runners quickly rot and they and the tubers soon turn into a slimy putrescent mess. 1€ I do not know whether this disease was in fact dysentery or was some other kind of enteritis.</page><page sequence="19">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 19 ANGAU and visiting Australian Army Medical Corps personnel attempted with some success to implement appropriate hygienic measures among the central Enga (for instance, the digging and use of latrines), but in some localities the disease did not abate until the end of 1945. I have not been able to discover any figures for the incidence of, or the number of deaths from, dysentery during this period; my impression is that the death rate was in general fairly low. While the Enga were still coping with these problems, yet another disease swept in from the east, this time to attack their pigs. It is unclear exactly what this " shortwind " was, but most likely it was a form of bacterial pneumonia. At any rate, it had a devastating effect on the Enga pigs, which normally were heavily infested with lung worms and other internal parasitic nematodes and among which verminous pneumonia was endemic (Animal Disease Survey, 1946 : 41-70). Given the scale and frequency of the inter-clan distributions of pigs made by Enga, it is not surprising that the disease spread rapidly to all parts of their territory, including those in which contact with outsiders had been minimal. Again we have no reliable figures concerning mortality rates but, to judge from the reports of ANGAU officers at the time and of Enga informants subsequently, they appear to have been high indeed ; perhaps as many as 20-30% of Enga pigs died before Administration officers brought the epidemic under control in the late 1940s by the use of antibiotic drugs and the shooting of many of the infected animals owned by central Enga. Finally, there seems also at this time (1943-45) to have been in various localities a marked increase in the number of deaths of pigs from the anthrax that had long been endemic in the area. Perhaps this was a concomitant of the debilitating effects of " shortwind " on the herds. It is clear, even from the sketchy account I have been able to piece together, that during the decade 1934-44 the Enga, including the Taro, faced a series of events that in many respects were without parallel in their remembered history - the sudden advent of the Europeans with their armed retainers and exotic possessions, the ability of these small parties of strangers to impose their will on much larger groups of Enga, the extraordinary winter of 1940 or 1941, and the several illnesses that later struck both people and pigs throughout the Enga domains. Nevertheless, the statements of men who were adult and socially active during that decade indicated to me that, in retrospect at least, the Enga did not necessarily view all these occur- rences as an unrelieved spate of inexplicable disasters. Thus, a great many Enga benefited directly from the considerable numbers of steel axes and machetes, as well as from the various sea shells, salt, tinned meat and the like, with which the Europeans paid for services and supplies. Such objects quickly entered the traditional large-scale exchanges and distributions of valuables that were so significant in Enga public life. Moreover, not only were the armed clashes between the foreigners and particular Enga groups intelligible in the light of Enga views of the exercise of power, but also various clans positively relished such military defeats of old enemies and were quick to take advantage of their troubles</page><page sequence="20">20 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS in order to encroach on their territories. Indeed, several clans, especially some who had the closest contact with the Wabag post, actively participated in ANGAU punitive patrols directed at groups with whom they were currently feuding. The outbreaks of disease, however, were a different matter. It is true that Enga in general had long been subject to endemic ills such as influenza, enteritis, yaws and leprosy, just as their pigs had always been a scrofulous, worm-infested species prone to anthrax and verminous pneumonia. In fact, one function of a number of Enga religious and magical rituals was to cope with just these disabling conditions. But the frequency with which the epidemics of the early 1940s entered the Enga region, as well as the rate and extent of their spread, put the traditional ritual and folk medical practices to an impossible test and left the people feeling vulnerable in the face of events that had obviously got out of hand. This was especially true of the western Enga who lived at higher altitudes and had suffered most in the earlier fierce winter. To judge from my informants' comments, it was the " shortwind " among pigs that had the greatest impact on the people, probably because porcine mortality was so high at all age levels, whereas, of the relatively fewer human fatalities in the influenza and dysentery epidemics most were among infants and the aged - that is, among categories that usually were at risk in the Enga population. However that may be, there is little doubt that for most people, whether they lived in the centre or on the periphery of the Enga region, the major unsettling consequences of the arrival of Europeans were seen in terms of sudden increases in the incidence of sickness and death, both human and porcine, and of the apparent failure of usually accepted techniques to deal with these calamities. It is important to keep this in mind in attempting to understand the millenarian movement that emerged at this time among the Taro Enga, one that for the sake of brevity I shall call " Ain's cult " and which I now describe. Ain's Cult The Beginnings During the early 1940s four brothers, named Lunggunu, Langgara, Pauwaiya and Wambilipi, lived at Lyeimi, a locality in Taro country on the north side of the Lagaipu River, not far from Tumandana. They were members of Kamani clan. The three eldest, all married, were men of substance and reputation ; the youngest, Wambilipi, was aged about 30 and had recently taken his first wife.17 In 1944 the ghost of their father, Ain, an important man who had died many years before, appeared in the dreams of some or all of the brothers. He told them that the great sicknesses which were striking the Taro and their pigs could be averted if the people would adopt new rituals to deal with them. Ain's ghost had learned of these 17 In 1956 only Wambilipi was still alive. I encountered him at Tumandana and tried to discuss with him his role in the cult. He was completely unforthcoming, in contrast to the other Tumandana participants who were happy to talk at length about the whole affair. Given the later reactions of the ANGAU officers and other Enga to the cult (see below), his reticence was understandable.</page><page sequence="21">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 21 rituals while hunting in the mountain forest. There he had come across a pond, from whose clear water had emerged a huge tree-climbing kangaroo (Dendrolagus sp.) that instructed him in the new techniques and doctrine and then re-entered the pool.18 The kangaroo's instructions, as conveyed by Ain and then by his sons, seem to have been mainly, indeed solely, aimed at the preservation of the health of people and pigs and at the maintenance of their numbers. Nevertheless, as we shall see, this apparent specificity did not hinder subsequent embellishments and re-inter- pretations of both dogma and practice in other communities. The brothers called a meeting of their clansmen and the latters' families at the Kamani clan danceground at Lyeimi and told them of Ain's prescriptions, which they were to disseminate among other Taro. The exhortations can be summarized as follows : (i) Inasmuch as recourse to the clan ancestral spirits had proved ineffective to halt the spread of the various illnesses, the Taro should, at least for the time being, give up the rituals they normally practised to propitiate these beings ; in particular, they were no longer to perform the " new and alien " rituals that involved the manipulation of kepele stones, although later they could again undertake with confidence the kaima pool rituals that they traditionally used to communicate with their clan ancestors.19 (ii) The Taro should recall that the sun and the moon were their original progenitors, " the father and the mother of us all " who were ultimately responsible for the presence of people and pigs on earth ; consequently they should turn through rituals to the sun for aid in this time of crisis, (iii) Each local descent group should build on its main danceground a substantial round house (similar to the usual ancestral cult houses hidden in the forests) with a high platform in front of it.20 All the families in the group were to gather here and the head of each was to bring one or two pigs as an offering to the sun. The sons of Ain would mount the platform (to be closer to the sun), where each would stare along the shaft of his spear at the sun. In due course the power of the sun would induce a fit of violent shaking in these men, during which they would call on the sun to protect the health of the 11 There are several points of interest here. Not only do some clans regard certain forest pools as the loci of ancestral spirits, but also in Enga dreams the appearance of a forest pool is often interpreted as an omen that the dreamer will receive wealth of some kind (see Meggitt, 1962). Note also that the kangaroo, which is certainly not aquatic, usually lives high above the ground. 19 This is the only context in which I encountered the suggestion that among the Taro the use of stone rituals for the ancestral cults had superseded (recently or otherwise) the use of pool rituals. However the known distribution of stone and pool rituals among Enga in general is compatible with an hypothesized spread of the former from the east or south-east to the west or north-west at the expense of the latter. » During the recurrent Te distributions of pork, central Enga commonly erect on their dance grounds platforms about four feet high and many yards long, from which they give out the meat. I do not think that formerly the fringe Enga in the west made 6uch platforms, but I cannot be sure of this.</page><page sequence="22">22 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS populace and their herds of pigs.21 Then the family heads were to hand up the chosen pigs to the sons of Ain, who would hold each high in the air, dedicating it (or its spirit-double) to the sun by means of new spells (learned from Ain) before clubbing it to death on the platform.22 The owners of the pigs should butcher and cook them communally in earth-ovens at their men's houses and then distribute the pork among their families to eat. The meat of any rufous pigs should be reserved for con- sumption by bachelors,23 and the sons of Ain should receive one side of each pig, together with its entrails and liver, as payment for their " hard work " in teaching this new ritual to their clansmen. (iv) Following this feast, the people were to wash themselves thoroughly in a stream nearby every morning for a month (" one moon " - see Meggitt, 1958a), the males first, the women next, in order to avoid contracting new sickness. During the first cleansing, the sons of Ain would stand on the bank of the stream and intone new spells (learned from Ain) over each group of bathers (both male and female) to ensure the efficacy of this prophylaxis. Subsequently, the people themselves should pronounce these spells, either overtly or covertly, while they washed.24 11 Throughout this Taro expression and all subsequent transformations of Ain's cult the element of violent shaking constantly recurred as a concomitant of entering into contact with the sun or less often with the sky-people. Initially, the practice of looking at the sun and shaking was probably an adaptation of the taripa pinggi shaking traditionally used by old Taro men to determine which ritual a local group should undertake to deal with particular misfortunes. Whether such behaviour by the cult adherents is to be regarded as spiritual " possession " of the kind encountered in some other religious complexes is, however, a moot point (see Lewis, 1971, for evidence and discussion). There did not appear to be any explicit idea that the sun or its power had in some way entered and taken possession of the shaker. Rather, the shaking, like the fire handling, was simply an overt signal that the cult leaders or messengers were truthfully reporting the intentions of the sun. In short, the central concern seems to have been with veridical or valid communication of instructions - just as in the common situation when an Enga medium (generally a widow) tries to communicate via the ghost of a dead son in order to ascertain the specific desires of another ghost who is attacking living relatives. At any rate, I do not think there is anything to be gained by viewing the leaders or prophets of Ain's cult as " shamans ". 11 As far as I could discover, at this point in the development of the cult the round houses were no more than tangible marks of its presence, backdrops to the more important platforms. Apparently no ritual or other activities were intended to take place inside these houses. As we shall see, this changed in other areas. The few pig-killing spells that I was able to record were cryptic, almost to the point of unintelligibility for the outsider (like many other Enga spells and songs). For instance : " sun moon spirit being, sun moon spirit being, leaves of Podocarpus tree destroy, vine leaves destroy, leaves of Evodia tree destroy ". The leaves mentioned are used (respectively) in kepele stone rituals, bachelors' purification rituals and post-menstrual period cleansing magic. The spell asserts that these rituals are being abandoned in favour of honouring and propitiating the sun and the moon. M I could discover no explicit reason for this. However, it is the case that Mae Enga associate *' red skins " with cannibals, immortal sky-people and Europeans. Moreover, in the kaitna pool rituals of several Enga groups, bachelors play a special role. 14 The manner of this washing (standing in the stream, while water pours over the face and torso from a pandanus-leaf spout set in a spring in the bank) and the presence of a man reciting spells over the bathers are clearly inspired by similar elements in the bachelors' purification rituals (see Meggitt, 1964). Nevertheless, for men (the sons of Ain) to be present while women wash en masse is an unexpected and most un-Enga variant.</page><page sequence="23">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 23 (v) The men should also observe a number of other requirements : (a) They should give up warfare (" break their spears ") and no longer shed the blood of their neighbours ; (b) they should put aside their fears of female pollution, abandoning the bachelors1 purity rituals, and instead should copulate with their wives frequently and without spells in order to beget many children25 ; (c) they should take good care of their hunting dogs and feed them well, for game would be an important source of meat until the present decline in their herds of pigs was reversed ; (d) they (and the women) should not eat tree pythons (Chondropython sp.), sugarcane and certain other vegetables such as pitpit (Setaria sp.) and auwe (a crucifer, Nasturtium sp. ?) for the space of one season (about six months) as an earnest of their turning to the sun for help.26 The temporal duration of these instructions is significant. Although the prohibitions on inter-group warfare and on restricting sexual intercourse were intended to remain in force indefinitely, the other requirements were limited in time. That is to say, there was the clear implication that once the group performed the necessary rituals to enlist the aid of the sun and to cleanse the actors, those people and their pigs would in effect no longer be vulnerable to that particular conjunction of disasters. Life would return to " normal " (albeit with its usual quota of sickness and death), and people could resume their kaima pool (but not the kepele stone) rituals in order to propitiate the clan ancestors whenever this was appropriate. In short, in its original form Ain's cult seems to have been a specific response to a unique set of problems, with no suggestion that the cult should peisist after it had solved these problems. The Kamani people eagerly accepted the words of the sons of Ain, and they carried out all the instructions without delay. Then the four brothers, together with their clansmen, visited other Taro centres of settlement to spread the new gospel. Apparently they were received with enthusiasm and their audiences hastened to build cult houses and perform the rituals. However, as accounts given me by Tumandana men indicate, already there were accretions to the basic corpus of instructions and practices. Thus, at Tumandana, Wambilipi, the youngest of the brothers, who led the proselytizing there, told the people that strangers (Europeans) were coming into the area, bringing with them new fashions and sickness. If the Taro adopted these 26 The prescriptions ($a and 56), if followed together, could perhaps have kept up group numbers in the face of the losses of old and young people to influenza and dysentery. " I could not ascertain why these particular foods were prohibited. Most Enga men hold snakes and lizards in such aversion that they will not touch them, let alone eat them - which is understandable in view of their attitudes concerning sexual activity (see Meggitt, 1964). In any case pythons are by no means common in this area. Sugarcane, pitpit and auwe are prized elements of the diet but usually are eaten only on festive occasions (see, however, note 38).</page><page sequence="24">24 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS exotic customs, they and their pigs would sicken. Therefore, they should make their offerings to the sun and bathe in order to eradicate the current sicknesses, and then they should cleave to the kaima pool rituals, eschewing all other innovations, including the " alien " kepele stone rituals. The Tumandana men brought pigs for Wambilipi to kill on the platform before the new cult house ; but now the pork was to be cooked in one large earth-oven on the danceground and eaten there communally. As the men butchered the pigs in readiness for the oven, Wambilipi spoke of the need to care for their hunting dogs and to make his point he fed pieces of choice pork to the dogs. Then he urged the men to give up fighting and dramatized his message by taking their spears to make a circular fence in the middle of the danceground. Within this enclosure he buried the guts of a sow, on top of which he planted an ornamental cordyline shrub (Cordyline tertninalis).27 This, he said, would always remind them of the dangers of shedding blood, and here the Tumandana men should eat the meat of pigs they killed for their ancestors. No other food was to be eaten here. Finally, Wambilipi walked into the oven fire, stood in the embers and ate two pigs' livers while looking at the sun and shaking.28 Then he picked up the red-hot oven stones and tossed them in the air, telling the people that his invulnerability to the heat was proof of the truth of his message and of the efficacy of the new rituals. This demonstration certainly convinced the Tumandana men. Indeed, several of them, after learning the new spells from Wambilipi, looked at the sun, began shaking and then stood unscathed in the fire. Aipa, one of these men, told me that at the time he simply felt compelled to imitate Wambilipi's actions. " I was not frightened of being burned ; I just did what he did because I was out of my senses." 17 Although the Enga and their neighbours do not eat any part of the cordyline, the shrub is important to them. Men use the leaves of several common varieties for rump covers, for tying bundles and for making measuring strings employed in house building. Both sexes use the leaves to line earth ovens. Individual men also maintain small plots of certain strikingly coloured or shaped varieties, which they believe are necessary elements in magic performed to attract wealth. 18 Although " fire walking " by initiates is a feature of some Huli ritual (see Glasse, 1965 : 45 ; 1968 : 107 1), there is no evidence that Enga ever practised it before the appearance of Ain's cult. Nevertheless, given the contacts (albeit indirect) of Taro Enga with Huli, it is possible that Wambilipi was here imitating Huli behaviour. However that may be, other actions of Wambilipi at the oven were cognate with those I have observed in a Mae Enga ritual, anggauwe pinggi, used to divine the intentions of, or to placate, angry domestic ghosts. A man who for any reason fears that the ghost of a deceased close relative (especially of his father) is likely to attack and kill him or a member of his immediate family, calls in a diviner to kill and offer a pig to that ghost. The diviner ties together the trachea, lungs and heart of the pig, holds them up towards file sun and shakes them as he recites a formula offering the pig to the ghost in return for releasing the intended victim. He does the same with a haggis made of pig's belly. He puts all of these organs in a small earth oven, carefully smoothing the oven mound and surrounding soil. Then as the meat cooks he watches to see if insects emerge from the oven or the soil. The appearance of any insect that moves about vigorously is a good omen, a sign of health and prosperity ; that of a dying insect or of an earthworm presages sickness and death. The diviner later removes the organs from the oven pit, which he fills with loose soil. The likely victim stands in the pit, and the diviner plants at his or her feet a stake to which are tied a cordyline shrub, a tuft of tree moss and a pandanus seedling. With the right hand the patient then holds up the haggis, suspended by a string, and presses this to his mouth while looking at the sun. At the same time the diviner constructs a low fence of pointed stakes around the oven and places moss on each point as he intones spells to placate the ghost. When the fence is completed, the patient steps out of the circle and, still looking at the sun, eats the haggis.</page><page sequence="25">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 25 As far as I could discover, among both the Taro and the other groups through which the cult later spread, no formal criteria defined those who could become " shaking men " (tnarakali). Bachelors, married men, Big Men, all were eligible to stare at the sun in the hope of receiving its aid. Nevertheless, although numbers of men (and sometimes women and children also) shook on occasion, only about four or five men in each locality became true shaking men, those who could handle fire and who were regarded by their teachers (and by the adherents) as clearly having the knowledge to direct rituals at home and to proselytize in other groups. Aipa became an ardent convert to the cult, and he was the main organizer of its activities at Tumandana. In addition, after each bout of shaking the ghost of his late father appeared to him in his dreams. The ghost several times showed him enormous, healthy pigs and quantities of big pearlshells which, he said, the Tumandana people would receive provided they scrupulously observed the rules about washing in the river. Without clean skins, they could not remain healthy and so live to enjoy this new wealth. Moreover, the ghost instructed Aipa to bring water (over which the cleansing spells had been intoned) from the spouts on the river bank and to pour it into small pits dug around the edge of the danceground. At some unspecified time in the future, pearlshells would be found in these pools, pigs would appear in the women's houses and new crops (unidentified) would sprout in the gardens.29 Aipa's (or his deceased father's) doctrinal addenda marked the first overt shift from the purely prophylactic aims of the cult to a concern with the acquisition of additional material possessions. There is little doubt that this was a response to the garbled stories reaching the Taro of the fabulous quantities of shell valuables and exotic foodstuffs (for instance, rice, sugar, tinned meat) possessed by the Europeans at Wabag, commodities that the latter occasionally used to pay for food, timber and services given them by the Enga living near the ANGAU post. Indeed, Aipa himself made this point when talking to me in 1956. In addition, there was even sound, although bizarre, evidence for the future arrival of huge pigs of a new kind. One of the coastal natives then employed at Wabag had brought with him (I have no idea why or from where he got it) a cow's tail. To the Enga, who had never heard of, let alone seen, cattle, this could only be the tail of the biggest pig in the world. News of this phenomenon rapidly spread through the western Enga group, together with the assurance (quite reasonable, in fact) that somewhere, perhaps in the sky world of Enga cosmology, people had whole herds of these desirable beasts. Having encountered wherever I travelled among western Enga in 1956 references to the existence of this great celestial pig, I am convinced that the fortuitous presence at Wabag of this preposterous cow's tail was an important factor in the ready acceptance of Ain's cult by the Taro and their neighbours. Of such is the stuff of history ! 19 As we shall see, this notion that artificial pools would be the repositories of wealth reappeared in many of the transformations of the cult. It was pretty clearly a reworking of the episode in which Ain found the forest pool from which emerged the uncanny tree kangaroo.</page><page sequence="26">26 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS Spread and Further Transformations of the Cult The acceptance of the cult by the Tumandana people appears to have completed the conversion of the Taro population. Although there was nothing in Ain's original formulation of the doctrine to suggest that he (or his sons) intended the proselytizing of other Enga to follow, this is in fact what happened. No doubt the ready reception by the Taro in itself generated a surge of enthusiasm that impelled the shakers out of mere altruism to share their knowledge with others ; but it would not do to overlook the fact that this knowledge was indeed valuable, that, as is customary among Enga, its transmission had to be paid for. Remember that from the beginning the four prophets received at least a side of each pig killed for the sun. Even allowing for the relatively small numbers of Taro donors (and hence of pigs offered) and for the distributions of this pork that the brothers doubtless made on each occasion to their followers, there was clearly a handsome gain to be made directly by the sons of Ain, while indirectly their various exchange partners would benefit in subsequent trans- actions with them.30 Obviously, then, it was in the material interests of both the brothers and their recruits, especially those who had personally acquired the new spells and had become shakers, to exploit fresh pastures. Whatever the explicit and implicit motives involved, the Taro men decided, apparently at Tumandana, to spread their tidings among neighbouring peoples. Accounts of just how this was planned are varied and somewhat obscure, but the actual itineraries seem to have been as follows. All four brothers, together with some 20 or 30 men (mainly shakers) and women, visited the Ipili to their west, after which they continued on to the Pai-era speakers (west of the Ipili) before returning home. Then Pauwaiya, one of the brothers, led a party of Taro to the Maramuni Enga to the north-east, some of whom later proselytized among the Mae Enga of the Ambumu Valley further east. At about the same time Wambilipi and several followers went south to the Waka Enga ; they were met with considerable suspicion and Wambilipi limped home with an arrow in his leg. Subsequently, however, the older brothers Lunggunu and Langgara made a successful visit to the Waka, who in turn passed on their versions of the cult to the Huli to their west. Nere and other shakers from Kamani clan spread the word among Aruni and Karintsu Enga groups in the western Kandepe (south-east of the Taro), while Aipa and men of Tumandana carried it to Yandapu Enga clans of the Lagaipu headwaters to their east. Two general features of this propagation of Ain's cult are noteworthy. First, the rapidity of the process was remarkable. These journeys and the concomitant recruiting of followers occupied only a few months. Second, apart from the setback Wambilipi received among the Waka, this substantial movement of groups of proselytizers and new adherents back and forth between communities possessing 80 It should also be noted that, to judge from informants' comments, at the feasts that followed the pig killing, both among the Taro and elsewhere, the prophets and their followers consumed some (in some cases most or all) of the sides of pork received as payments. Moreover, it is clear that on all these occasions, given the number of animals killed, there was a substantial and most un- Enga wastage of meat through spoiling, particularly of entrails and other less valued portions.</page><page sequence="27">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 27 different customs and dialects was accomplished relatively peacefully - even though until recently these people had often fought each other. Both facts are further evidence of the unsettling effects the epidemics were having on the western Enga and their neighbours and of the people's readiness to try novel ways of combating them. The Cult among the Ipili of the Porgerà Valley*1 The party of Taro men and women led by the four brothers visited at least six or seven Ipili localities, in each of which they preached Ain's message to appreciative audiences. However, during this peregrination both the doctrine and various of its attendant rituals underwent a number of interesting, albeit intelligible, changes. I could not discover whether the prophets deliberately introduced such changes or whether they arose from Ipili re-interpretations of the prescriptions. Perhaps both processes were operative. To the Ipili assembled at each clan danceground the sons of Ain spoke of the failure of traditional practices (such as the kepele stone rituals used to propitiate ghosts or ancestral spirits) to avert the sicknesses currently attacking them and their herds. They urged the Ipili to turn for help to " our father " the sun, who would ensure that, after the people's performance of the appropriate rituals, they and their pigs would enter the sky-world, to live there in good health for ever. Moreover, once they were established in the sky-world, the progeny of their pigs would attain great size, becoming as large as that much-discussed beast whose tail had been displayed at Wabag. This doctrinal shift towards an emphasis on a kind of bodily assumption, although apparently radical, was but a logical extension of the belief prevailing throughout the area in the existence of a celestial world inhabited by the immortal offspring of the sun and the moon, a realm from which came the eponymous founders of terrestrial phratries or clans and, in the opinion of many, also the powerful, wealthy and seemingly indestructible Europeans. The Ipili readily accepted the message and followed the prophets' instructions. On each danceground they constructed a high platform, to which they brought many pigs as offerings to the sun.32 The brothers and other Taro men stared along their upraised spears at the sun and shook violently, then stood in the fires and handled the embers to demonstrate the invulnerability that their new knowledge had conferred upon them. Some Ipili followed suit and thus became " shaking men " (marakali), 81 This account derives from information Ipili men gave me during my sojourn among them in 1956 (see also Meggitt, 195 7-5 8a). Pai-era men then visiting the Porgerà told me that events followed much the same course among them as they did among the Ipili, but I was unable to spend any time in the Porgubieri valley to pursue these statements further. Apparently the Pai-era did not pass on the cult to their neighbours, which suggests that their acceptance of it might not have been as wholehearted as that of the Ipili. 82 It seems that, with the spread of the cult, the converts in each locality killed many more pigs as offerings than did the original Taro adherents. Whether this was in response to the proselytizers* demands or was simply an expression of their own enthusiasm, I cannot say. At any rate, among Ipili and Maramuni Enga (and perhaps others), this combination of lavish pig killing and the continuing presence of " shortwind " left the people with severely depleted herds for several years after the cessation of cult activities.</page><page sequence="28">28 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS entitled to learn the new spells and to be the local cult organizers. The various spells were concerned with the killing of pigs for the sun, the ritual bathing, copulation and the coming of the time of darkness (see below). The brothers killed the pigs on the platform, holding each one with its snout towards the sun while clubbing it with a small steel tomahawk. The donors of the pigs butchered and cooked their own beasts in earth-ovens on the danceground, giving net bags containing the guts, liver, kidneys and one side of each pig, plus cowrie shells and pieces of pearlshell, to the visitors as payment for the spells and rituals they were receiving.33 The Taro men in turn bespelled the kidneys, together with Evodia leaves, and they and the Ipili ate them together.34 The prophets then buried within a circle of stones in the middle of the dance- ground the guts of a sow, on top of which they planted a cordyline shrub.27 Here, they said, the people must build a large round house, whose main post should be set in the stone circle.36 Within a few months massive discharges of lightning would signal the coming of a great darkness that would cover the land for days or weeks, during which time the local people must shelter within the cult house and intone the spells that would invoke the help of the sun to disperse the cloud of darkness.36 Some of the Taro men would come to them at this time and encircle the house, both to encourage them and to join them in uttering the spells. Then enormous moropae pythons would hang suspended from the sky, and all the people and their pigs would make their way into the sky-world along the " paths " formed by the bodies of the snakes.37 In the meantime, while awaiting these startling events, the Ipili should confine themselves M There was no reserving of rufous pigs for bachelors to cook and eat. *4 Among the Enga generally formal commensality is a public statement of the establishment of new social relationships between individuals or groups (including ghosts and ancestors) or of the repair of an earlier breach between them. »5 The cult houses initially erected by the Taro resembled the relatively small, cylindrical or bell-shaped edifices formerly used in the rituals to propitiate the clan ghosts or ancestral spirits. However, as the cult spread into other areas, the houses (which could be round or oval, depending on the locality) came to be much bigger - presumably to fit the new functions allotted to them. Now they were some 20 to 30 feet in diameter, 15 feet or more in height, and their construction entailed the hauling of substantial logs for use as main posts. Even so, the local groups erected these houses quickly, taking only a few weeks to complete the framework. 10 Enga generally believe lightning to be the house fires of the sky-people, visible as the latter open the doors of their houses and emerge to urinate. The lightning cleaves a hole through the clouds and enables the urine to fall to earth as rain. Lightning is also likely to strike men (or their houses) whose behaviour has angered the sky-people - for instance, those who have performed such " anti-social " acts as fouling sources of drinking water, felling ancestrally planted trees around dance grounds, or copulating near ancestral cult houses. 17 Moropae pythons are thought to dwell in the deep forest, of which they are in a sense guardians. They are enormous (many feet long), cunning and usually hostile to men because the latters' settlements encroach on the domain of the moropae. Thus, a moropae on seeing a hunter walking through the forest goes ahead to a place where the path skirts a ravine or gully, spits up slime on to the track and lies in wait below. The hunter slips on this coating and falls into the cavernous open jaws of the moropae. Similarly, if a party of hunters or travellers is passing the night in a forest hut, the moropae coils its body three times around the shelter and shakes it until the panic stricken inmates rush outside and plunge into the open mouth that covers the doorway. Given the characteristics usually ascribed to these mythical snakes, it is somewhat surprising to find them enlisted in an activity that was intended to help men escape disaster.</page><page sequence="29">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 29 to a diet of pork and sweet potatoes. In particular they should not eat bananas {Musa spp.), taro (Colocasia sp.), fruit of the oil pandanus (P. conoideus), or the flesh of tree pythons (Chondropython sp.), otherwise the spells to remove the dark cloud would not be effective and the moropae pythons would not appear.88» 89 After the killing of the pigs at each locality, the visitors commanded their hosts to wash under a sluice set up on the bank of a stream nearby in order to cleanse and prepare their bodies for the ascent into the sky-world. Here again, new features appeared in both ritual and dogma. Women, it was said, had always been sources of pollution, and men had to employ magic to protect themselves from such dangers when they copulated with their wives.40 This, however, was no longer adequate to ensure the degree of cleanliness required for acceptance into the world above. Accordingly, the prophets taught the local people how to deal with this problem so that they could, after a month of sexual abstinence, resume copulating and procreating without fear of the consequences. First, the brothers took a pearlshell from the payments given them, bespelled it and wrapped it in a piece of tapa, together with a quantity of red pigment.41 Then they stood beside the water spout at the stream, holding the bundle in the falling water •• In view of the sexual anxieties commonly expressed (both directly and indirectly) by Enga and Ipili men, the presence of this concatenation of phallic objects (snakes and elongated fruit and vegetables) presumably has some deeper significance than mere similarity of shape, but what exactly it is escapes me. »• The expectation of the coming of darkness can probably be connected with a widely known Enga story that tells of a great dark cloud of fine " dirt " that briefly covered their land at some time in the past. The local variants of this story are markedly consistent. I give a Mae Enga version of the story in Appendix I. Other anthropologists have recorded similar tales in various parts of the highlands (for instance, Glasse, 1965 : 45-46 ; Watson, 1963). All seem to refer to the consequences of a major volcanic eruption on or near the mainland of New Guinea. However, suggestions that the stories point to the Krakatoa explosion in Indonesia seem to me to be untenable in the light of its recency (1883) and of what we know of the extent of its effects (see Naval Intelligence Division, 1944 : I» 25-27). 40 The details of such magic vary among Enga groups but the basic pattern is fairly constant. When a young man first marries, he does not approach his bride for about a month. During this time an older married man (often a father's brother or a mother's brother) teaches him the spells to use each time he and his new wife copulate ; generally the technique involves spitting on one's hand, bespelling the spit and rubbing it on one's belly " to fasten the vital juice so that it will not be lost with each ejaculation " (shades of Dr. Strangelove 1). The instructor also strengthens the groom's body by rubbing it with a bespelled leaf from his own A corns calamus plant, a cutting of which he gives to the neophyte to cultivate for the latter's future use. After every coition the recipient should rub his body with a leaf of this plant to ensure that his corporeal vitality and mental functions remain unimpaired. The groom repays his tutor with a new net bag filled with pork and pig's entrails, plus a cowrie shell (a splendid vulvate symbol !). He should employ the techniques at least until the birth of his first child. Some men, however, continue to use the spells until they are well into middle age. 41 This procedure was clearly a variant of one of the many forms of taki magic, which Enga men use to attract to themselves wealth in the shape of pigs, pork, shells, etc. The pigment can either be pulverized dark red ochre or trade paint (both imported at considerable cost for groups such as the Maramuni Enga who are in contact with peoples of the Sepik Hills). A man intones spells (bought or inherited) while wrapping in a tapa bundle an ounce or so of the pigment, plus leaves of Evodia sp. and of Acorus calamus, stems of met ai fern and the wing bones of a fruit bat (Pteropus sp.) (see note 61). Before attending a distribution or exchange of valuables (such as a wedding, a funeral, a death or homicide compensation, or a Te assembly), he uses the bat's bones to paint his face with the pigment. The mere sight of this potent powder is thought to compel his exchange partners to give him many more valuables than he could otherwise expect to receive.</page><page sequence="30">30 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS and uttering spells as the local men washed below and received the protective power emanating from the charm. After the men withdrew, the local women bathed, while the wives of the visitors held the unwrapped pearlshell in the water and scraped it with a stone. The fragments thus dislodged were thought to enter the vulvas of the women bathing below and neutralize their potential for polluting their husbands when next they copulated. Everyone repaired to the danceground, where the hosts sat quietly while the visitors retired to decorate themselves as for a festival, using the shells given them as payment. The latter then returned, running round and round the seated people and flogging them soundly with nettles and thorny vines before dashing to the stream and back. In this way, the prophets told the local people, we have driven the sickness out of you to be carried away by the water, just as we drive off the ghosts of the dead.42 Give up fighting, observe the food taboos we have laid down, do not copulate for a month, then, when the time of darkness comes, you will all follow " a good path ". There will be no more sickness or death among you and hence no more ghosts or any need for rituals to propitiate them. Go now and build the cult house in readiness for the darkness. The Taro visitors took the payments they had received and moved on to the next locality, promising their hosts that they would return to assist them when the darkness came. Some of the " shaking men " from each host group accompanied the prophets from place to place, and a few went briefly to Taro country with them in order to learn more of the spells, ritual and dogma. Other shakers among the hosts stayed at home to supervise the building of the cult house and the observance of the new rules. There is no doubt that among the Ipili the manifestation of Ain's cult had become in many ways much more elaborate, not to say dramatic, both in doctrine and ritual I cannot tell whether this development simply expressed the logical working out through time of assumptions implicit in the original dogma before the Taro entered the Porgerà valley or whether it came about in response to what I intuitively believe is a greater complexity inherent in Ipili religious belief and ritual, a characteristic that in turn may well be a consequence of the frequent and long-term contacts the Ipili have had with their southern neighbours the Huli, whose religion is extraordinarily rich (see Meggitt, 1957-580 ; Glasse, 1965). Whatever the truth of the matter, the apparent innovations were largely adaptations (as I hope I have indicated) of ideas and practices long and widely spread throughout the region. The interesting point is the way in which all were brought to bear on the basic aim of the people to get themselves into a condition whereby sickness and death would be with them no longer. Whereas the original Taro formulation of the cult seems to have been a desire for a return to the status quo ante, in which the " normal " incidence of illness and death was acceptable, the Ipili version stressed perpetual health and, in a sense, personal immortality. 41 On some occasions, when taking a corpse for burial (especially that of a leper), Enga men run along the path and thrash the air with branches in an attempt to drive the malevolent ghost away (at least temporarily) from the house of the mourning relatives.</page><page sequence="31">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 31 It is possible, although there is no direct evidence to confirm the suggestion, that this concern of the Ipili reflected a heavier impact on them of the epidemics of dysentery and " shortwind ", just as it is possible that, for whatever genetic or environmental reasons, " indigenous " diseases (for instance, malaria, yaws, tropical ulcers) had always been more severe among the Ipili than among their Enga congeners (as they certainly were in 1956 when I was in the Porgerà). Perhaps the combination of introduced and endemic diseases was particularly lethal in the Porgerà valley. Moreover, it is clear that inter-group fighting there was often extremely destructive, even up till the late 1950s. I noted that, after Ain's cult was established among the Taro, some of the men of Tumandana, apparently influenced by Aipa's dreams and by information coming from Wabag, extended the original dogma and ritual to secure wealth as well as health. Something of the sort occurred also at a later stage in one of the Ipili localities, Tipininni, which significantly enough is not far from Tumandana. Furthermore, this reinterpretation was connected with another striking feature of the passage of the cult through Ipili country, namely, the important part that the Taro women played in it. Normally, Enga women have a very limited place in public affairs, including rituals. At best they provide an audience for the men, fetching and carrying provisions for them and cleaning up after them. Yet here they were members of the prophets' party, participating with men in matters of great moment and, in the cleansing of the Ipili women, directing a ritual of crucial import. Such behaviour was most un-Engalike. Whether any of these visiting women were shakers is uncertain, but at least one Ipili woman was. This woman, Ipiama of Tokaiera clan, was a spinster, apparently in her twenties (which suggests at once that, given local marital norms, she was in some way unusual). When the Taro came to Tipininni, at the start of their Ipili itinerary, she became a shaker to such effect that, after that party's departure, her clansmen accepted her as one of the local supervisors of the cult. As time passed and, despite the people's scrupulous observance of the prophets' commands, the darkness did not appear, they became sceptical of the genuineness of the message (I discuss this below). Ipiama, then, either in dreams or during her bouts of shaking, learned from the sun that at the bottom of Tindipa, a pond hidden in the high mountain forest near Tipininni, lay a great number of new pigs and pearlshells, waiting for the Tokaiera people to collect them. Most of her clansmen by now rejected her exhortations to cleave to the new cult, but she was able to persuade (how I do not know) three men, the wife of one of these men and a young girl to accompany her to Tindipa to look for the wealth. They were to take several pigs there and build a small hut in which to spend the night. Next day they would kill and cook the pigs as offerings to the sun, then line up beside the pond. Each person would hold five Ficus dammaropsis fruit bespelled by Ipiama and, at a signal from her, would throw them at each other's livers (why I do not know). Then all except Ipiama were to jump into the pond (which is quite deep) and dredge up the pigs and pearlshells.</page><page sequence="32">32 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS It seems that the enthusiasts did all of these things. Ipiama waited and, when the searchers did not reappear (few Enga or Ipili can swim), went back to Tipininni. She told the rest of her people what had passed, stating that the original divers must still be collecting the great quantity of valuables in the pond, and she asked for more volunteers to help them. A visiting Yandapu Enga man, finding Ipiama's story wholly implausible, went at once to Tindipa, where eventually he discovered the corpses of the wealth-seekers. He informed the men of Tipininni, who retrieved the bodies for proper burial and then hacked Ipiama to death with their axes. Some people said that the men took her to Tindipa for execution and threw the pieces of her body into the pond, not wanting to have such a crazy ghost haunting the clan settlement.43 The Cult among the Waka Enga of the Wage Valley" After the Taro proselytizers had returned home from their " work " among the Ipili and Pai-era people, Wambilipi, the youngest of the sons of Ain, made his abortive visit to the Waka at the head of the Wage valley. Subsequently, his elder brothers Lunggunu and Langgara led a party of Taro (including women) first to the Kera basin, where they converted the few Yandapu Enga living there, then, accompanied by Kera men from Kindarepe, to several of the Waka clans residing along the upper reaches of the Wage.45 It seems that the Taro themselves went only about as far south as Pauwaiya before turning back, leaving the Waka people to carry the word further down river. I could discover no reason for this decision. It did not appear to stem from any overt conflict with the Waka, most of whom readily accepted the cult ; indeed, some of them also gave it to their western neighbours, the Huli.46 Moreover, the Waka devised an ingenious system for passing on the cult that admirably suited the catenated disposition of their local groups along the narrow Wage valley. Lunggunu and Langgara and their colleagues not only taught the new dogma and rituals to the few Waka clans at the head of the chain but also actively helped the members of each of these to begin building the cult house, participated in the killing of pigs and subsequently directed the cleansing of the congregation. After the visitors received their payments and departed, members of these indoctrinated clans (A), that is, men and women who had become shakers, went to the next clan (B) down the valley and instructed this group. While the men of B were erecting their 48 Ipili men in 1956 swore that these bizarre events did occur as I have described them and, indeed» in the same year Waka Enga men in the Wage valley told me much the same story, which they said certainly happened near Tipininni. Nevertheless, I still find the whole thing hard to swallow. 44 Most of the information presented here and in the next section I gathered in 1956 when I accompanied an Administration patrol down the Wage valley and through the Kandepe (see Meggitt, 195^-57)- I also discussed the cult with Waka and Kandepe men who were visiting the Mae Enga from time to time between 1955 an(i J957« 45 I walked through the Kera country en route to the Wage, but I was there such a short time that I learned relatively little about the cult among these people. My impression was that in general Kera cult activities resembled those of the northern Waka. 46 Whereas I know little about the fate of the cult among the Huli, my colleague Robert Glasse has information on this.</page><page sequence="33">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 33 cult house, the people of A moved on to the next clan (C) to explain the cult. Then they returned to clan B to officiate at its pig-killing and cleansing, after which they were paid and went home. The converts (shakers) of clan B then visited clan D to teach its members. While clan D was making its preparations, the people of B led the pig-killing and cleansing of clan C, then returned home with their payments. The shakers of clan C then instructed clan E and, during the preparations of clan E, guided the rituals of clan D. Shakers from clan D taught clan F and helped clan E - and so on. In this way the cult moved from the head of the Wage River downstream as far as its junction with the Andabari River, where resided the Wapima whose territories marked the southern limit of the Waka Enga. Further south were the non-Enga grasslanders and the people of Lake Kutubu, with whom Waka had long been associated in the salt and tree-oil trade (see Meggitt, 19586). Apparently Wapima men (shakers) were able to utilize these connections to transmit the cult to the southerners, from whom, they told me, they received handsome gifts of pigs, pork and shells in return. Some of these valuables they handed on to people upriver as extra payments for the latter's " hard work " in bringing them the new knowledge. The information given me at various localities along the Wage indicated that marked differences occurred in the expressions of Ain's cult as it moved from head- water clans to those near the Andabari junction.47 This was not simply a matter of the addition and subtraction of details of belief and practice. Rather, there was a significant shift in the cult complex from a concern with the preservation of health and the acquisition of wealth to a preoccupation with wealth alone. The Waka mode of disseminating the cult clearly facilitated the occurrence of such changes. Instead of the original founders of the cult going from group to group to teach them a more or less consistent version of the " authorised " dogma and ritual, as happened in the Porgerà, each Waka clan receiving the message was able to pass on its own more or less idiosyncratic interpretation to its immediate neighbours, who in turn proselytized with their variants, and so on. Moreover, according to Waka informants, the clans further down the Wage valley did not suffer as severely from the epidemics of dysentery and " shortwind " as did those to the north. This difference may perhaps account for the absence among the southern Waka of any emphasis on the goals of immortality and of freedom from human and porcine sickness. To indicate the extent of this variation I describe two manifestations of the cult - the first at the Waka headwaters, the second near the Andabari confluence. The people of Tindi clan (Makapu phratry) at Pauwaiya learned of the cult directly from Lunggunu and Langgara and their Taro and Kera followers - and here already the instructions and rationale differed from those given earlier to the Taro and the Ipili. There were the usual exhortations to give up the bachelors' 47 One feature that remained constant here among the Waka Enga, as well as in all other areas into which the cult spread, was the invoking by the various prophets of the presence of the cow's tail at Wabag as evidence of the size of the new pigs that would come from the sun or from the sky-people. c</page><page sequence="34">34 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS purity rituals and the propitiation of clan ancestors through the kepele stones and instead to invoke the assistance of the sun, " our father ", in this time of trouble and sickness. But the prophets now asserted that only those who made offerings of pigs and cleansed themselves in the prescribed manner would live forever in the sky-world ; all others would be left to die here on earth. In addition, before the chosen ascended into the sky, the sky-people (" the children of the sun ") would send them quantities of large pigs, pearlshells and steel axes to take with them to their new home. The proselytizers displayed their credentials by staring at the sun and shaking, and by standing in fires and handling live coals. These performances convinced most of the hosts of the power of the new message, although some of the wealthier men remained sceptical. People (including women and children) began to shake, and some men, who were to become cult organizers and prophets, also entered the fires. Lunggunu and Langgara produced lengths of bamboo filled with water. This, they said, came from the forest pond where Ain had encountered the mysterious kangaroo and in which he saw a sample of the wealth that the sky-people would give to true believers. They dug holes about three feet deep and three feet in diameter around the edge of the danceground and poured a little of the water into each one. At the appropriate time the new wealth from the sky would appear in these pits. The visitors then helped their hosts erect the framework of a large cult house, with a platform in front of it. In the middle of the danceground they drove a circle of spears into the earth to mark the site of the oven.48 During these activities they taught songs and spells to the new shakers. When all was ready, the Tindi people decorated themselves and brought shells and other valuables to the danceground to give to their teachers, as well as pigs to offer to the sun. Everyone sang and danced all through the night. Next morning the Tindi sat inside the cult house and the local shakers led them in the new songs, while on the platform Lunggunu and Langgara presented the pigs to the sun and clubbed them. The owners of the pigs cooked them in the common oven. They reserved a side from each pig as payment for the visitors and set aside a whole pig for the latter to eat apart from the hosts. The Tindi people then ate the rest of the meat (bachelors did not receive the rufous pigs for themselves). Early the next morning the visitors supervised the washing of the Tindi in a stream, men in one group, women in another. They intoned spells over the bathers and poured water on their heads, but they did not employ any of the valuables at this time. Before departing, the prophets gave the local people these instructions : (i) Complete the building of the cult house ; (ii) " throw away " the kepele stones and abandon bachelors' rituals ; (iii) continue killing pigs for the sun and eating the meat, until all are consumed ; the sky-people will replace them ; 48 No cordyline shrubs surrounded the spears, nor were pigs' guts buried there.</page><page sequence="35">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 35 (iv) until the new wealth arrives, do not copulate lest this imperil your newly acquired purity ; (v) for the same reason, butcher pork on platforms and not on the ground, because sickness may be there ; (vi) similarly, do not kill and eat sick pigs ; if they die, bury the carcases away from the danceground; (vii) eat no game but bush rats (Hydromys sp., Uromys sp.)49 ; (viii) do not eat the vegetables Setaria sp. or Acanthacaea sp.49 ; (ix) do not travel far afield lest the wealth appear in your absence and outsiders steal it ; (x) within a few months of the completion of the cult house a cloud of darkness will cover the land for a day and a night ; during this period everyone must remain in the cult house and chant the appropriate songs to ensure that water fill the holes around the danceground ; when the darkness dissipates, the local shakers must visit the pits to remove the pigs, pearlshells and steel axes placed there by the sky-people ; they should then distribute these among the Tindi, who have cleansed themselves and faithfully observed all the injunctions of the prophets ; on no account is this wealth to be shared with other people ; (xi) soon after this event long " ropes " (similar to but bigger than the cords used for tethering pigs) will hang from the sky and the chosen, together with their possessions, will climb these to enter their new habitation. Clearly, the cult as the Tindi men described it to me was in most respects recognizably the same as it was among the Ipili, the main difference being that the acquisition of wealth now received as much emphasis as did the avoidance of sickness and death, and an appropriate method for securing the wealth was added to the corpus of ritual actions. It is interesting to observe how one of the original and seemingly minor elements of the cult, namely Ain's pond in the forest, reappeared as a pool full of valuables and so justified the digging of the pits in which the sky-people would place the desired objects.50 Also noteworthy was the shift towards the notion that the rewards of the cult would not automatically be available to everyone but would be confined to those who carefully followed the new rules. This seems to have been a response to the presence of sceptics in the community, men of substance who would not participate wholeheartedly in the cult activities.51 Both characteristics, the stress on gaining wealth through ritualized behaviour and the individual scepticism about the efficacy of this approach, may well have been 4» I could discover no explicit reason for these prohibitions. 50 In this respect, the episode at Tipininni, when Ipiama persuaded her friends to seek valuables in Tindipa pond, an event known to some Waka men, might have had some significance. 61 Although these sceptics, presumably to play safe, offered some of their pigs to the sun and underwent the washing ritual, they did not kill the rest of their pigs while waiting for the coining of the new wealth. Instead, they hid the animals in the forest and continued to tend them there. When later the cult collapsed (see below), the local people depended on the offspring of these pigs to replace their herds.</page><page sequence="36">36 THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS a consequence of the fact that several Waka men, perhaps five or six, had earlier accompanied Taylor's patrol to Wabag and, subsequently, had maintained relatively frequent contacts with the ANGAU officers and their native subordinates at Wabag in the hope of securing some of the valuables being distributed there. Whereas some of these men apparently believed that they could, by means of the usual pragmatic modes of trade or exchange, get access to the commodities handed out by the Europeans, others were overwhelmed by the sheer variety and exoticism of the Europeans' possessions and were thus ready to seize on the new cult as a way (perhaps the only way) of sharing in this fabulous wealth. That is to say, for them Ain's cult was as much a path to " cargo " as it was the avenue to health and immortality. However significant this kind of attitude might have been in the transformation of Ain's cult, by the time the cult had passed along the chain of Waka clans to the southern limits of their territory it was concerned solely with the acquisition of wealth by people here on earth, even though its general form remained unchanged. Thus, the prophets from further upriver who visited the people of Waimbia clan at Wapima told them that, if they built a cult house and platform, killed all their pigs for the sun and cleansed themselves, the sun would ensure that in due course they would receive new, bigger pigs and other valuables. There was, as far as I could discover, no suggestion that acceptance of the cult would guarantee immunity from sickness, immortality, or residence in the sky-world. Nor was there any mention of the coming of darkness or of the descent of snakes or ropes from the sky. The visitors went through the usual performances of staring at the sun, shaking and rolling in fires in order to persuade their audience of the validity of their instruc- tions, and several of the latter followed suit. The prophets killed a rufous pig, after presenting it to the sun, and buried portion of its entrails and fat at each point on the danceground where a pillar of the cult house was to be set. They gave the meat of this pig to the Waimbia bachelors to eat. At the same time the prophets planted a circle (about ten feet in diameter) of cordyline shrubs opposite the door of the cult house, and in the middle, of this circle drove a smaller ring of spears into the ground. In future, they said, all meat was to be cut into small pieces and cooked over a fire made on top of these spears. However, until the sun sent the new wealth, nobody was to eat the fat or kidneys of any animal but instead should burn these in the special fireplace as gifts to the sun. The prophets directed their hosts to dig a number of deep holes around the perimeter of the danceground. When the cordylines around the fireplace flowered (which would be a matter of months), they said, the Waimbia men who were shakers must fill the pits with water (the visitors had not brought any special water for this purpose). That night all the local people should sit in the cult house, while the shakers went out periodically with torches to inspect the holes, in which the new pigs, shells and axes would appear. The shakers would distribute the valuables among their clansmen, all of whom would henceforth be Big Men, that is, men of substance able to engage in many transactions.</page><page sequence="37">THE SUN AND THE SHAKERS 37 On the evening the framework of the large cult house was completed the Waimbia assembled with their pigs. In the middle of the danceground they piled up the axes, pearlshells, cowries and other objects that comprised part of their payment to the prophets for their tuition. The hosts and visitors, lavishly adorned, sang and danced through the night, their festivities punctuated by periods during which people shook and played with live coals, and the prophets climbed with extraordinary rapidity up and down the framework of the cult house.52 At dawn the prophets mounted the platform and began killing the pigs, holding each one up to the sun and uttering spells as it was clubbed. The Waimbia cooked the meat in earth-ovens around the danceground, reserving rufous pigs for bachelors to eat and setting aside a hind leg and the heart, liver and lungs of each of the other pigs to be heaped up with the rest of the payment intended for the visitors. Next morning at dawn the visitors, wearing all the ornaments given them, took the local people to a stream. As the naked Waimbia men and women bathed in two groups, the prophets went upstream and, to the accompaniment of spells and songs, washed their valuables so that the " essence " of these floated down and touched the other bathers, thus ensuring that the latter would later receive the wealth from the sun and become Big Men. The visitors then departed with their spoils, leaving the Waimbia to wait for the flowering of the cordyline plants. M. J. Meggitt. (To be continued) 52 This ability (and agility) of the climbers was also taken to be a proof of the worth of their cult knowledge. The logic of this escapes me, other than the obvious equation of " being high in the air " and " being in communication with the sun ".</page></plain_text>
