<plain_text><page sequence="1">929 XXXI. SOME MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. By A. KEURIEDALE KEITH. rpiIE last few years have seen the successful application to so many forms of religious belief of theories which at first sight appear to have no support in Vedic myth or ritual, that it is natural to ask whether this apparent peculiarity of Vedic religion is real or not, or whether there exist in the ritual as preserved traces of beliefs and practices which reveal a state of religious thought older than that presented to us in the main body of the ritual. Of these theories three aspects are most important. The theory of totemism still has many supporters; recent research in Australia has confirmed in the main the results of previous enquiry, and Mr. Lang, Dr. Jevons, and others contend that it solves many problems of Greek mythology and cult. It is impossible to define the system with any accuracy, but a clan may fairly be said to be totemistic if it deems itself to be descended from some plant or animal whose name it bears, and which or part of which it wears as a badge, if it observes strict marriage laws, if it shows reverence to animals or plants of the species, and either does not eat thera at all or only on some occasion of especial solemnity when the totem animal is slain with tokens of sorrow for the slaughter of a kinsman, nnd then eaten sacraincntully to renew the bonds of brotherhood between the members of the clan and their totem. Whatever its origin, such a scheme of religious belief is intelligible and seems to have actually existed j.ii.a.r. 1907. 0:5</page><page sequence="2">930 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. both in Australia and in North America, and its possible occurrence in Vedic religion is not to be denied.1 It appears from Servius, JEneid, ii, 785, that on Mount Soracte the Hirpini, a wolf tribe, performed a wolf dance, and Mr. Lang2 naturally finds in this a clear case of totemism. Greek instances are numerous, though none are certain, but Apollo Lykeios, Apollo Smintheus, and tho bear-maidens of Brauron, could all be explained on the hypothesis of totemism,8 which, Mr. Cook4 has tried to show, existed in the Mycenaean age. But even assuming that the theory of totemism is not accepted, Semitic religion shows clearly, as Robertson Smith has proved, a conception of the animal sacrifice as the sacrifice of one akin at once to the sacrificer and to the god, who share alike in its flesh and blood, so that the sacrifice is at once a shedding of kindred blood and a renewal of the union between god and man. Whether such sacramental meals exist in Greek religion is disputed, but the ritual of the Diipolia5 is a fairly clear instance, and the worship of Diouysos undoubtedly shows the idea of the theanthropic animal. Dr. Frazer,6 again, accepting the facts as to the slaying of the god relied on by Robertson Smith, but rejecting the theory of totemism, has made elaborate efforts to explain all the phenomena by the theor}' of the corn-spirit, which when the corn is cut takes refuge in animals or men, who may then be killed to enable the worn-out spirit to revive 1 I eunuot, however, accept Oldonberg's view (Religion des Veda, p. 85, n. 1) that the exigence, if proved, of totemism in (iret.ee und Italy ia a proof that totemism is Aryan. There is overwhelming evidence that much of Creek ami Italiau religion is due to tho pre-Aryau Mediterranean race; cf.

The October horse1 at Rome seems clearly an example of such a rite, and no less clear is the case of the Thargelia2 at Athens, while similar practices are found all over Europe and Asia Minor and in Egypt. If we turn to Vedic religion, the traces of totemism are by no means convincing. Professor Macdoneirs3 summary shows that the evidence is practically confined to names like the Matsyas, Ajas, Sigrus, Vatsas, Sunakas, Gotamas, Milne!iikeyas, Kausikas, and Kasyapa. In the Satapatha Brahmana Prajapati appears as a Kunna, and it is said that, since Kfirma is identical with Kasyapa, all beings are held to be the children of the tortoise. Samvarana, ancestor of the Kuru kings, is said by the Epic to have been the son of Rksa (bear), and the name Arksa occurs in Rg-veda, viii, 57, 10. This evidence, however, falls far short of proving totemism. The Satapatha passage (vii, 5, 1, 5) is merely a piece of theology and is of no weight, in view of the countless absurdities which the Brahmanas contain. The Epic notice does not carry us further than the tribal names, and we have no right to say that to bear the name of an animal must mean totemism. There is no proof that the Matsyas adored fish or claimed kindred with them. A stronger piece of evidence than any yet adduced might be found if in the Aitareya Aranyaka, ii, 1, 1, vaydmsi could be taken as the name of a tribe,4 for in the Baudhayana Dharma Sutra, ii, 8, 14, 10, it is expressly said, vayasdm hi pitarah pratimayd caranti, and the most probable theory of the origin of totemism seems to be that the spirit of the ancestor is imagined as passing into some animal or plant, which thereby is conceived as being akin to the tribe and, as the recipient of the ancestral spirit, an object of veneration, and birds aro natural recipients5 of the souls of the departed. 1 Warde Fowler: op. cit., pp. 241-250. * Fnrncll: op. cit., iv, pp. 208-284. s Vedic Mythology, p. 153.

But it is quite easy to assume that names were adopted for other reasons, because tbe tribe was rich in cattle, or dwelt among horseradishes, and so forth.1 It may, of course, also be argued that the cases of theriomorphisin of gods are relics of totemism, since under that system the animal is regarded as divine, and when it has passed away, or a new system has been superimposed upon it, traces may remain in the occasional attribution to an anthropomorphic god of an animal form. But two other explanations of these cases are at least equally probable. In the first place the theriomorphic god may be a remnant of a period of zoolatry when beasts were worshipped, not as totems, but simply as powerful to aid or injure men. There appear to be clear traces of such zoolatry in Vedic religion, whether the deification is quasi-permanent, as in the case of the cow2 or serpent,8 or only temporary, as in the case of the ants (Kausika Sutra, 116), the worms (Taittiriya Aranyaka, iv, 30), or mice (Hillebrandt, Ritual litteratur, p. 85). In the second place, the fact must be admitted that primitive man was wont to identify animals and things with deities by a process of symbolism which must be understood in the sense that the symbol is actually conceived as pervaded by the deity or as a temporary incarnation of the deity. Thus Poseidon Hippios4 in Greek religion arose from a primitive and widely spread idea, which sees a resemblance, and therefore a partial identity, between the sea and the horse. The horse is not an object of worship in itself, but as identified with the god of whom it is an incarnation. To this set of ideas we must probably 1 Cf. Uurdou, The Khasis, pp. 65, 66. Mere food tabus (e.g. Oldenberg, op. cit., p. 415) prove rtothiug for tott'inism. See also Hopkins, J.A.O.S., \\i, p. tiiv. 2 Macdonell: Vedic Mythology, pp. 1,50, 151. 5 Ibid., p. 153.

These instances, however, would not prove conclusively that the god was actually conceived as theriomorphic. It might be held that the descriptions of Indra as a bull were merely poetic comparisons of the strong god who fertilises to the animal, and apparently Dr. Hillebrandt2 holds this view. But though it is conceivable that to some minds this was the case, the probability is not great. The primitive mind insists on a real identity in a similarity, and could hardly avoid regarding Indra as to some extent present in the bull.3 Fortunately ritual, a much more trustworthy guide than mythology, gives us some help. In the Vajasaneyi Samhita, xi, 12 seq., in the Agnicayana Agni as the sun appears to be represented by a horse in the ritual, and also by a goat. In the offering of the spit-ox in the domestic ritual, Hiranyakesin, ii, 8, tells us that the ox called Isana was placed to the south, a cow to the north, and between them their calf. Three dishes of cooked rice were prepared and offered to the animals with the words, " Hail to the god Bhava!" " Hail to the wife of the god Bhava! " and " Hail to Jayanta! " It is quite certain that the cow and the ox are conceived as for the time being incarnations of the god and goddess, and it may be remarked that here we have a piece of evidence in favour of taking Rudra to be a god of vegetation as much as a thunder god, since the ritual identification of the bull and the vegetation spirit is a common feature of religion as in the case of Dionysos. It may be noted that Hadad, the chief male god of the Syrians, was likewise at once a thunder god and a god of 1 Macdonell: op. cit., pp. 148-150. * Thiere und Gotter im vedisehen Ritual, Breslau, 1905, p. 7. 1 The choice of colours of nuimals, of which Hillebrandt gives many cases, points in the same directiou. Similarity means partial identity.</page><page sequence="6">934 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. fertility.1 The bull similarly represents the god Ksctrapati in another rite described by Iliranyakesin, ii, 9. In the Caturmasya rite offerings were made to a ram which represented Varuna and a sheep which represented the Maruts.2 Oldenberg8 quotes cases where a horse is stationed so as to look at the place where fire is produced by friction, where fire is deposited in the track of the horse when it goes in advance, and where the offering is made in the ear of a goat. Probably these cases afford a clue to the curious old ritual preserved from a common source in the Grhya Sutras of A^valayana, ii,' 4, 8-11, Sankhayana, iii, 14, 3, and Gobhila, iv, 1, where at the second Astaka ceremony a cow or a goat might be sacrificed, or optionally an offering might be made to a cow. It is of course possible to add this to the instances of direct worship of the cow, but the contrast between the optional courses becomes improbably violent. If, on the other hand, we take it that the cow was regarded as the incarnation for the time of the god, the contrast becomes less remarkable. Finally, it seems we must recognise in the horse of the Asvainedha an incarnation of the sun. The Rg-veda, i, 1G3, 2, states that the sacrificial steed was fashioned out of the sun, and in the Vajasancyi Samhita, xxiii, 32, the 6teed is expressly called Dadhikravan, who is elsewhere clearly an emblem of the sun. Further, the divine character of the horse is shown by the fact that the sacrificer offers it the remains of the night oblation of grain which, if the horse refuses to eat them, are thrown into water, doubtless as being too sacred for human consumption. The slaying of the divine steed, however, raises at once the question whether we havo not here a case of totemism or of a corn-spirit. In favour of either theory might be quoted Vajasaneyi Samhita, xxiii, 16, where at the moment when the fatal blow is administered the unfortunate animal 1 Frazer: Adonis, Attis, Osiris, p. 80. 2 Hillebrandt: MtuallitUratur, p. 116.

Stud., xiii, p. 247, n. 3.</page><page sequence="7">MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. 935 is assured that it is not really being injured, but only being sent by fair paths to the gods. For, on the one hand, the slaying of the kindred totem is a mournful act to be ignored as much as possible, while on the other hand Dr. Frazer1 has collected numerous instances where the slayers of animals seek in every way to appease them and avert the vengeance of the offended ghosts and of the other members of the species. Moreover, there are cases on record where the corn-spirit has been deemed to take the horse as its resting-place, as in the clear case of the October horse at Rome. Or, again, the simpler form of Dr. Frazer^ theory may be accepted in which the annual sacrifice of an animal is directed to strengthen by sympathetic magic the species. It is impossible to deny the plausibility of these theories, but the facts permit of another explanation. We cannot, however, hope to make good Dr. Ilillcbrandt's2 position that in the selection or avoidance of certain animals for sacrifice no trace of totemism or of theriomorphism can be found. Indeed, Dr. Hillebrandt3 supplies ample material to refute his own proposition. In the Asvainedha, Parjanya receives as an offering the *frog, and the frog is a very natural symbol of the rain-god in India ; fish are offered to the waters, and dolphins to the sea. The daksina at the sacrifice to Aditi is a cow. In a rain spell the otter is offered to Apain napat (Kausika Siitra, 127). Indra constantly has bulls offered to him, and is the bull par excellence among the gods. Agni is a goat, and goats are offered to him. Ptisan, lord of herds, who takes his place at the Asvainedha in the form of a goat, has goats offered to him. No doubt the paucity of animals available for sacrifice made other gods receive the same offerings, but that fact need not have destroyed the special propriety felt in each case when the choice of animal coincided with the special character of the god. The rule is, no doubt, accurately stated in Paraskara 1 The Golden Bough7, ii, pp. 380 seq. Cf. Hunter: Indian Empire*, p. 100. * Thiere und G'ottn', p. 5. 3 Op. cit., pp. 6-8. The purusamraa offered to the moon (Taittiriya Samhita, v , 5, 15) is ot particular interest. Cf. Oldmberg, op. cit., pp. 357 359.</page><page sequence="8">936 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. Grhya Sutra, iii, 11, 10, that at a sacrifice directed to a special deity the animal belonging to that deity should be sacrificed, and a portion should be made for the god und carefully conveyed to him. Instances could be multiplied, but there is no possibility of doubt as to the main principle. On tho other hand, the explanation of the custom is not certain. In some eases a simple explanation is possible. If the gods are conceived as surrounded like men with au animal world for their amusement,1 then in slaying animals the sacrificer may be conceived as sending the gods a present of a new plaything, just as to the dead man slaves and horses are offered by many peoples to attend him in the next world.2 So it may be thought that the goat sacrifice to Pusun was merely a gift to the god of a beast to bear his car. This view is certainly a possibility, but in the case of Pusan it is not very probable.8 It must be remembered that not only do we actually find Pusan as meutioned above himself in the form of a goat, but that in many cases animal attendants on a god ure a survival from a time when the god himself was deemed to bear an animal form. A familiar Greek example is that of Artemis and the bear,4 and it seems clear that the lions which appear in Cretan and Asianic art are really symbols of the sun-god.5 We must therefore accept as a real problem the practice of sacrificing to the god an animal in which at times the god was deemed to be incarnate. Against an explanation by totemism, it may be urged thut totemism merely accounts for the rare ceremonial eating of the slain god, and not for the numerous instances of animal sacrifice found in early Vedic religion. But this argument would only show that totemism was in an advanced stage of decay when the 1 Macdouell: op. cit., p. 148. Oldenberg : op. cit., p. 74. a Frazer: Adonis, Attis, Osiris, pp. 188, 189. ' Oldenberg (op. cit., p. 73) recognises the probability that Pus, in originally was conceived as a goat. 4 Faruell: op. cit., ii, pp. 435 seq. * Evuiim: Journal of Hellenic Studies, 1901, p. 161.

Similarly, even if the original intention in slaying a goat for Pfisan was, as it would be on Dr. Frazer's theory, the desire to strengthen the species goat or to destroy the outworn vegetation spirit, }-et the times of the Vedic animal offerings refute the idea that these primitive conceptions still reigned. It is then, perhaps, best to fall back on the theory that to the Vedic Indian the animal sacrifice was only a gift in the crude sense of the present of food to gods who, like men, were fain to eat, and would, if well fed, bestow boons on their votaries. Now the natural thing would be to select for an offering that food which would be most acceptable to the god, and to believers in magic the proposition that the god who is sometimes a goat will feed especially eagerly on the goat would probably seem self-evident, since the god would thus, acquire anew the qualities of the victim. The suggestion of cannibalism is only apparent, since the god is much more than the goat, which, however, stands in a mystic relation to him. In Vedic religion, at any rate, where we find clear examples of zoolatry proper as in the case of the cow or the snakes, the sacred animal is not offered to itself. The theory approximates to the simplest form of Dr. Frazer's views, but it differs essentially from them. For in his theory, which may be an adequate explanation of many cases of sacrifice, the slaying of an animal is merely a piece of magic to multiply the species, accompanied by a series of attempts to propitiate the anger of the dead. The theory here adopted, on the other hand, assumes the existence of gods conceived as theriomorphic, but in origin great natural forces regarded as animated, to whom gifts are brought bjr worshippers. If it could be proved as satisfactorily as it is confidently asserted that magic ideas such as those supposed in this case are always older than the conception of the need of winning the divine favour by gifts, then it would probably be necessary to give up the hypothesis which we accept, but it seems far safer to recognise that the currents of magic and religion, in the sense of the</page><page sequence="10">938 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. recognition that there exist forces beyond magic which must be propitiated and not compelled, run parallel, and that in explaining cult resort must be hud to either set of facts. The theory requires to be supplemented before it can suffice to cover all the facts. One common feature of the ritual of the animal sacrifice elsewhere is the fact that the performer touches the animal with a sacrificial implement, and then the sacrificer touches him, and this is found both in the Grhya and the Srauta ritual.1 This must, of course, be intended to convey to all those participating in the rite the sanctity of tbe animal. It is hardly sufficient to account for this sanctity that the animal might in some cases be chosen because of its being the occasional embodiment of the god, for the fact occurs in other cases of sacrifice. The probable explanation is that the coining of the god to the place of sacrifice and his entry into the victim to make it his own account for the sacred character of the victim. Thus an animal, in no wise divine2 before the sacrifice, might in the course of the rite acquire a sacred character and be much more than an ordinary animal, while at the same time it was not felt by the worshippers that they were killing their god. This would explain the Asvainedha. In it the horse perhaps was originally offered to the sun, and it may be significant that in the Vajasaneyi Samhita, xxii, 9-14, Savitr is assigned such prominence, lie was chosen because of the fact that the sun is repeatedly, as is proved by the ritual and mythology alike, regarded as theriomorphic as a horse. The horse's markedly sacred character therefore follows from his affinity to the sun, and from the entrance of the gods into him when chosen for sacrifice. Similar ideas are common in Greek religion. A Homeric hymn tells of the grove of Poseidon at Onchestos in which horses were entered by the spirit of the god, and Poseidon was often considered as of equine form.3 The 1 Hillebrandt: Ritualhttcratur, pp. 73, 122. Oldeuherg: op. cit., pp. 332, 499. 3 Still more so, of course, if the animal were already quasi-diviue. 3 Faruell: op. cit., iv, pp. 20 seq.</page><page sequence="11">MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. 939 blood and flesh of the hosioter at Delphi were so sacred as to place the priest in close relation with Apollo, in whose honour the beast was slain.1 Since the Vedic Indians do not seem to have interpreted their sacrifices as the slaying of a god, it is not remarkable that we find little trace of sacramental meals such us those depicted among Semites by Robertson Smith,2 in which undoubtedly we have the eating of a god as a means of communion with the divine. Rut a meal may be called a sacrament which falls short a good deal of the Semitic sacrament.3 In the first place the eating of part of a victim, of which part has been consumed by the god, is in itself a means of becoming one with the deity, since to primitive man the eating of the same food results in similarity of essence. In the second place, since the god, by entering into the animal at the sacrifice, fills it with the divine essence, the eating of the animal is a direct means of fellowship. "We must probably recognise both these ideas in the numerous sacramental meals which we find in the ritual. The general rule in the Grhya ritual is laid down by Sankhayana (ii, 14, 2-3), " Let him eat nothing without having cut off (and offered as a bali) a portion thereof " In entertaining strangers flesh is to be served, and precisely as in Homer we find that every meal is also a sacrifice (ibid., ii, 15). Eating of the remnants of the sacrifice is enjoined in the iipiikarana (ibid., iv, 5, 10). Remnants of food belonging to the Manes, gods, guests, and servants may be eaten by a snataka (ibid , iv, 11, 1'J).4 It is particularly interesting to note the reference to the Manes. There can be no doubt that the conception of the offerings to them was a meal, in which the descendant sought to place himself ' Ibid., p. 258. 2 Religion of the Srniitr*. 3 Cf. Ftiruell, llihhat Journal, Jan., 1901; Frazrr. Adonis, Attis, Osiris, p. 172. 4 Thi* practice may perhaps explain the reference in the Uhaktamfila to Kr?rm frntlierinp* the wnsfc f&lt;?"d at the IMjnsuva whieh Dr. Grierson discusses, supra, pp. 080, CHI. F??r other example-* of sacramental meals see Oldenberjr, op. cit., pp. 326 mm|. ; and cf. tbe renson given in the Satapatha Brahmana why Brahmanas only can sacrifice (S.B.E., x.w, p. 321).</page><page sequence="12">940 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. in union with them by sharing the same food, and eating the remains of food tasted by them would be felt as bringing about a particularly close union.1 With this may be compared the tabu so common in savage tribes on the remains of food eaten by the chief, who is considered as the possessor of a powerful spiritual influence, which is communicated to the food of which he partakes, and renders it dangerous for a commoner to taste. Again, in the sacrifice to Ksetrapati described by Hiranyakesin, ii, 9, all the relatives eat remains of the offering made to the bull which here represents the god. In the Madhuparka2 the Rudras, Adityas, ViSve devas, and beings partake, then the sacrificer has a portion, and then a Brahmana. If this cannot be done, the sacrificer may eat the whole or throw it into water. The latter alternative clearly indicates the holy nature of the food of which the gods have partaken. Other instances are common, and it is probably a result of the practice of the sacramental meal that we find the custom of feeding Brahmanas on many occasions either with actual parts of the sacrifice or with other food. Naturally, in the ritual as developed the Brahmanas usurped the place of the other members of the sacrificer's family until their presence obscured the original sense of the rite. In the face of these facts we cannot accept the view of Dr. Hillebrandt3 that the Indian conception of sacrifice is opposed to the Semitic in so far as the latter is an act of communion in which the god and the worshipper join in partaking of the flesh of the animal. Dr. Hillebrandt points out against this view that in India the blood of the victim was deemed an offering to demons and therefore impure. But in fact the blood seems to have been considered too sacred for consumption by the worshippers, and to have been regarded as an offering to the earth-goddess, represented 1 So the wife of fie sncriticcr, who wishes children, tastes the offering to the pitra, aud thus wins their favour (Gobhila Urhya Sutru, iv, 3, 27). 1 Alvalayaua Orhya Sutra, i, 24. * Thiere und Goiter, p. 4. Oldeuherg (op. cit., pp. 327, 328) aud Hopkius (J. A.O.S., xvi, p. ccxxxix) take substantially the same view.</page><page sequence="13">MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. 941 often, as all over the world, by the snakes.1 As earth deities tend to be or become deities of the underworld, the tasting of blood would put the worshipper in unpleasant contiguity with the infernal powers and would be avoided. So in Greek religion2 the origin of the practice of purification from murder appears to have been the idea that by cleansing with the blood of the pig, a chthonian animal and an embodi ment of the earth-goddess, the murderer would put himself in a sacramental union with the offended deity, and in other pieces of ritual blood is connected with death and a new life.8 But iu the case of the flesh it is surely impossible to doubt that the sacrificer ate with the god to put himself in communion with him. When he did not eat, it was because the god possessed some chthonian attribute which rendered too close contact undesirable. So in the case of the spit-ox offering to Rudra, which was by some offered after midnight out of sight of the village, the sacrificer was forbidden to partake of the victim or to carry any part within the village, and people were to be kept away from the vicinity of the place of sacrifice, else the god would harm human beings. This is conclusive proof that the animal became in sacrifice pervaded with the divinity of the god. But ASvalayana4 preserves for us the important notice that on an express injunction the sacrificer might partake of the sacrificial food, which would then bring him great luck. The divinity of the animal was normally too great for safety, but might in a special case be made fortunate use of. The substantial points of difference between the Semitic and the Vedic ideas of the animal sacrifice lie rather in the fact that, (1) though the animal might be chosen because of its close connection with the god, and, in the actual sacrifice, be filled with his divinity, 1 ASvalayana Grhya Sfitra, iv, 8, 27. - Farnell: op. cit., iv, p. .'{01. Fra/er (Adonis, Altin, Osiris, n. 103) and Rohde (Vsyehc*, ii, p. 77) differ, but their views arc much less probable. 3 Cf. Mannhardt: Mythologische Eorschungen, pp. 97-90. 4 Orhya Sutra, iv, 8, 34. Cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., pp. 333 seq.</page><page sequence="14">942 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. yet the Indian did not strain this to the logical conclusion that in the death of the victim the god himself died, and (2) that, though the Indian recognised a certain kinship between man and god strengthened in the rite of sacrifice, and realised the quasi-divine character of the victim, yet ho did not consider that the victim was of close kin to himself, and that his death was therefore the slaying of kindred blood and a source of sorrow. There remains one piece of ritual on which a word may be said. Paraskara, iii, 12, describes a penance for a student who has broken the vow of chastity, which includes the sacrifice to Nirrti of an ass, the skin of which he then wears for a year. Two explanations of this seem possible. In the sacrifice the ass would be filled with the divinity of the goddess, and so the skin would, if worn, serve to place him in constant communication with the offended goddess. AVe would, in fact, have an example of the supplicatory sacrament seen in the Greek ritual of purification referred to above. This explanation suits most accurately the rite as it presents itself in the Sutra since Nirrti is expressly mentioned. But it is also possible that at the first the reason for the wearing of the ass-skin was different. Loss of chastity may have been conceived in tho more primitive sense of loss of virility, and the ass hide may have been worn2 as a magic spell, as is suggested by the view of some teachers recorded in the Siitra, iii, 12, 7. In that case it is a fair conjecture that we have a trace of an ass form of the Asvins, to whom in the primitive form of the rite the offering may have been made?for Nirrti is not, of course, an early deity. The Asvins have an ass as their steed and may well have been themselves conceived as in ass form, for they are reckoned as like buffaloes and flamingoes and their steeds are sometimes 1 Cf.

Now it can hardly be without significance that the Asvins in myth so often renew the virility of the aged or infirm as in the cases of the myths of Cyavaua, Kali, Ghosa, Iliranyahasta, the cow of Sayu, etc.2 The connection with them of the ass can hardly be independent, of this fact, whether it is that the Asvins owe their position as givers of fertility to a primitive identification with the ass or the identification is due to their powers of fertility. But in this, as in practically all points in connection with religion, we must be content with bare probabilities.-1 The most formidable rival to the theory of the wearing of the ass-skin here adopted is the toteinistic, especially as in Mycenaean religion 4 there have been seen by some clear traces of the sacred character of the ass and the existence of a totem clan. But we find no clear evidence in India of anything similar. That the ass was an embodiment of the corn-spirit is no doubt possible, and in that case the ritual of fertilisation in the Lupercalia at Rome5 may be compared as showing the power conceived to be resident in the thongs of goat-skin used by the priests. But here, again, other Indian evidence for the ass as a corn-spirit is wanting. Still more difficult is the problem presented by the purusamedha in its various forms. Une set of cases is, however, comparatively simple. In the Agnicayana, one of the opening ceremonies is, according to the Satapatha Brahmana, vi, 2, 1, 5, a sacrifice of five male victims? a man, a horse, a bull, a ram, and a he-goat. There were optional forms of sacrifice, hut we may follow Weber6 in 1 Bloomfield: J.A.O.S., xv, p. 270. 1'robably they were once conceived as horses (Oldenberg, op. cit., p. 73). - Macdonell: op. cit, p. f&gt;2. 1 If the ass is so regarded, this would explain its prcscnee with the horse and goat?both representing deities?at the Agnicayana (Oldenberg, op. cit., pp. 78-80).

The belief in the efficacy of blood, especially human, to secure the permanence of a building by its use in the composition of the cement stands in no special relation to any religious belief, and is merely a piece of magic, though possibly the view that blood had this mystic power was due to the fact that it was offered to the earth and demons like the ltaksases,1 who in part represent the souls of the dead. The outpouring of blood might be deemed to attract their favour, and their partaking of the blood might give the mortar, in making which the blood was used, especial strength. Another part of the ritual consisted in preserving the heads of the victims to form part of the lowest of the layers of the structure. The idea of this practice was doubtless to secure active watchers to guard the altar. A similar motive has plausibly been seen in the head-hunting of the natives of Borneo.2 Much more serious problems are presented in the ritual of the Rajasuya3 and the Purusamedha proper. That there was ever a human sacrifice in the former ritual rests merely on the fact that at one point the story of Sunahsepa was recited. As another story, with presumably the same contents, was recited at the Purusamedha,4 it is impossible to feel any certainty as to whether we can accept the view that there was ever any human sacrifice in the lliijasiiya itself. There remain, therefore, as evidence of human sacrifice the clear account of the Purusamedha in Saukhayana, which evidently contemplates an actual sacrifice, and the legend of Sunahsepa, which is certainly, as Weber urges, extremely old in character. At first the story appears to point to a ritual in which the 1 Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., pp. 162-1G1; Oldenberg, op. cit., pp. 60--G2. * Fume^s : Home-Lijc of Borneo Head- Hunter*, p. 59.

But the explanation of these legends may well often be different. Dr. Frazer interprets them on the basis of the divine character of the king-priest. From time to time the king must be slain to preserve the strength of the vegetation spirit. In the course of time the inconvenience of slaying the actual ruler permitted the substitution for the sacrifice of some mimic rite, or the victim ceased to be the king, and became merely one of the royal house, who would also be partly divine. The facts can also be quite satisfactorily explained on the totcinistic hypothesis. For if the animal of sacrifice is akin to the clan, and is treated in the sacrifice as human, as is no doubt the case, the tendency, especially in time of trouble, to substitute3 for the theanthropic animal a man and one of the purest blood would bo very great, and the practice might, in times when totemism had dis appeared through religious conservatism, be continued until abolished on humanitarian grounds. Still, a third explanation is possible. The earliest conception of sacrifice may have meant the actual consumption of the victim by the god, but undoubtedly the tendency of the idea was to become merely that of a gift to gratify the god. In time of national calamity it would be felt essential to appease the wrath of heaven at any cost, and so the king would be expected to sacrifice his most precious possession, his eldest son and heir. Thus the Carthaginians did in time of defeat, and so did Mesha of Moab, while Hamilcar at Himera offered his own life as an offering for victory.4 We need, perhaps, 1 Farnell: op. cit., i, p. 94. 2 Frazer: Adonis, Attis, Osiris, pn. 12, 34, 38, 85, 182, 314.

G4</page><page sequence="18">946 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND TIIE VEDA. see no more thau a recollection of such a custom in the legend of Hariscandra. The Purusamedha1 presents other problems. In the first place, it is impossible to regard that rite in the form in which it has been preserved to us as more than a mere duplicate of tho Asvamedha save for the substitution of a man for a horse in the offering to Prajapati. The ritual agrees with that of the Asvamedha very closely in all details, and the Vaitana Sutra accurately expresses the relation in the words (xxxvii, 10) puruxamedho 'ivamedharat. Dr. Hillebrandt2 has, indeed, argued with much ingenuity that the man-sacrifice was the source of the well-known Itg-vedic verses x, 18, 8, and 85, 21, 22, but this attempt has not received much support,3 and so the strongest piece of the evidence he urges for the antiquity of the practice disappears. He also argues that, had the sacrifice not been a real one, the Brahmanas would not have preserved a record of it, since it involved the death of one of their own order, but this ia to take an excessively optimistic view of human nature, and in any case the victim might equally be a Ksatriya, according to Saukhayana. There can be little doubt that the Delphic Oracle, in many ways a distinctly civilising influence, nevertheless encouraged the idea of the peculiar efficacy of human sacrifice,4 and priests who assisted in the vast slayings of animals prescribed at the Asvamedha and actually practised as late as Asoka's time,5 can hardly be credited with superabundant compassion. It is, then, perhaps legitimate to conjecture that the Purusamedha owed its existence to a priestly improvement on the ASvamedha, while the fusion of the Sunahsepa legend with 1 Weber: Ind.

Another influence, doubtless, was that of myth,1 in the shape of the legend of the creation of the world by the sacrifice of Purusa, which would find its counterpart in the human sacrifice. This is the view presented in the text of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, xxx, xxxi, where the ceremony is merely a type of the sacrifice of Purusa. No doubt such instances of myth producing cult are rare, but there is a clear example in the offering of a dwarf-animal to Visnu referred to by Dr. Hillebrandt.2 To what extent the sacrifice was actually carried out must remain doubtful. It is, however, important to notice that the Purusamedha was a rare offering, inasmuch as it could only be made after the victim had been allowed a year's freedom3 and enjoyment of all he desired. We may therefore suspect that the rite was seldom, if ever, put in force, and this would explain the fact that so little notice is taken of it in literature, whereas the Asvamedha is constantly referred to, and that when mentioned it is nearly always in conjunction with the Asvamedha. To this conclusion, which reduces to very moderate dimensions human sacrifice in Vedic cult, it may plausibly be objected that the Vedic Indians can hardly have failed to practise a rite of which instances arc found in very many religions, and were known to the aboriginal inhabitants of the country. Hut it may bo noted that such sacrifices an* usually bound up with the worship of the earth-goddess regarded as a vegetation deity,4 and such a cult is not 1 Cf. Griflith : translation of While Ynjur Vcdn, p. 255. 2 Thicre und Glitter, p. 7. 3 The parallelism with the Mexican rites described by Snhngun nnd others is striking as tar as regards this point. Rut the rule is lound in the Astamedha, and seems originally to have been due to the solar character of that rite, and in other points the parallel breaks down. 4 Cf. Frazer, The Golden Bough ?, ii, pp. 238-248 ; Maunhordt Baumkultus,</page><page sequence="20">948 MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGION AND THE VEDA. prominent in the Vedic pantheon. Further, we cannot postulate that religions all pass through the same stages, and, although Vedic worship shows many signs of the primitive customs of an agricultural and pastoral people, it cannot be proved that the Indians must have accepted human sacrifice as part of such customs. But here, as elsewhere, we must be content with probabilities. If, then, we accept the view that human sacrifice is not a characteristic of Vedic religion, we must assume that Hinduism owes to the earlier Indian races, Kolarian or Dravidian, the human sacrifice which is admittedly a constant feature of the worship of Siva and Durga from the times of the Epic downwards.1 In this ritual it can hardly be doubted that Siva appears as a vegetation spirit and Durgii or Kali as the earth - goddess, and the nature of the sacrifice as a spell to secure good crops appears clearly in the practice among the Khonds2 of scattering pieces of the victim's flesh over the fields, while, as in Mexico, it was deemed a good sign if the victim wept copiously. On the other hand, sacramental eating of the victim in the sacrifice at Jaintia3 seems proved, and, while it can be explained without recourse to totemism, it may point to such a system. The prevalence of matriarchy4 among the Khasis tends to point in the same direction, since matriarchy is often associated with totemism. There is a tradition in the Nongstoin State5 that the Siems are descended from a stag, and, while mere animal names of clans are inconclusive, this claim of descent is significant. pp. 359-361 ; Faruell, op. cit., iii, pp. 19, 20; Dieterich, Archiv f. Religions wissensch., 1904, pp. 10 seq. The sacrifice among the Kha.sis (Burdon, op. cit., pp. 94 seq.) may have been an offering to propitiate tbe earth-goddess, or merely an offering to the snakes. The sacramental meal at Jaiutia (ibid., p. 102) is noteworthy. 1 Of. Hopkins, Great Epic of India, pp. 378, 474; Hunter, Indian Empire*, p. 262. * Macplicrson: Memorial* of Service in India, p. 113.

It is a fair hypothesis that, among the other facts2 of the worship of Nagas, wc may find place for a totcmistic worship of snakes by tribes of kindred blood with the Khasis. If so, probably several elements3 went to form the basis of human sacrifice in the ritual of Siva and Kali, though of later years the sacrifice as accepted by the priests was doubtless regarded merely as a piacular rite. A notice in the SaktanandatarafiginI4 confines to kings the right to offer the sacrifice, possibly a confused reminiscence of the old l'urusamcdha. 1 Burdon, pp. 15, 10, and J.R.A.S., 1907, pp. 744, 745.
