<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE Mechanics of head injury and politics of brain damage Dinesh Mohan Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi 110 016, India Types of head injury and the mechanical basis of such injuries are reviewed in this paper. A brief description of the history of attempts to explain thé biomechanical basis of head injury is also included. The review summarizes the present understanding of human tolerance to head impact injury and the criteria developed to characterize such injuries and set safety standards. Recommendations on how these criteria can be used to make our equipment and environment safer are outlined. The following cases are to be given up as hopeless, viz. fracture of the pelvic bone (or of bones that are of this description, wherever they may be situated); dislocation of the pelvic joints; compound fracture of the thigh bone (or of the flat bones); fracture into small pieces of the frontal bone or its dislocation; simple fracture of the breast bones, backbone and temporal and cranial bones. The Sushruta Samhita1 Human beings have always taken great care to protect their heads from injury because until a few decades ago we knew very little about human tolerance to head impact, about designing effective head protection devices, or about treatment of head or brain injury. As the above quotation shows, very early medical texts considered serious head injuries to be unsurvivable. There was empirical recognition of the fact that falls on hard surfaces (especially from heights) result in more severe injuries than falls on soft surfaces and that blows on the head by blunt objects can cause brain damage. This resulted in design of helmets, initially made from animal hides and later on of metals, mainly for protect ing soldiers in battle. There was almost no progress in the understanding of the forces involved in producing head injury and the associated mechanisms from the turn of the first millennium AD up to the early 1940s, when some very important studies were published. In 1941 Denny-Brown and Russel2 carried out the first animal experiments which established the impor tance of head acceleration for the onset of concussion. Sir Hugh Cairns, a pioneer neurosurgeon, was instru mental in reducing head injury mortality among World War II motorcyclists by ensuring that they wore helmets3. In 1943 Holburn4 published a landmark paper on 'Mechanics of Head Injuries'. He was the first CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 65, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 1993 person to attempt physical and theoretical modelling to propose a hypothesis for the mechanics of head injuries. He concluded that there are 'two main causes of injury: (1) deformation of the skull with or without fracture; and (2) sudden rotation of the head which is responsible for the so-called contrecoup injuries, for haemorrhages and probably for concussion'. All of these pioneers worked at Oxford. At about the. same time, DeHaven5 in the USA published a study of human survival in falls from 50 to 150 feet and concluded that the 'human body can tolerate and expend a force of two hundred times the force of gravity for brief intervals', and that 'structural provisions to reduce impact and distribute pressure can enhance survival and modify injury within wide limits in aircraft and automobile accidents'. These studies set the stage for collaboration between professionals working in the physical and life sciences for developing a better understanding of the mechanics of head injury and for using this knowledge to design and develop safer equipment, products and the environ ment. This paper summarizes these developments of the last forty years or so, and the state-of-the-art in head injury control. Suggestions are also made on how this knowledge can be gainfully employed in reducing the prevalence and incidence of head injury in India. Methods of biomechanics research Human tolerance to injury can only be established in quantitative terms if all the physical factors involved can be identified and measured and then related to the associated injuries. It would be obvious that forces, energy, accelerations, strains and stresses cannot be measured easily in all situations and human beings cannot be used in experiments to produce injury. Therefore these kind of data have to be obtained using different methods and then collating all the knowledge to gain an overall understanding. 'Real-life' studies A great deal of useful information about mechanical forces and injuries can be obtained by studying 'real life' injury events. An example is DeHaven's pioneer 749</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLE ing work on falls from heights5.

However, since transport is a state subject each state has to notify and enforce it separately. At present the law is being enforced only in Delhi and Chandigarh. Even in these places pillion riders are being exempted. In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka the law was once notified by one set of governments. When the respective governments lost in the assembly elections and the opposition parties came into power, the latter removed the helmet laws for narrow populist purposes. There is no pattern of enforcement or removal con nected with party ideology. This is in spite of the fact that scientific studies all over the world have de monstrated conclusively that the helmet is the single most effective safety measure for two wheeler riders. Studies also indicate that the helmet is not particularly harmful for the neck in a crash. On the contrary, the helmet also reduces the transmitted forces to the neck when the head hits something hard. Our studies also show that any helmet, as long as it has thermocole padding is better than no helmet at all66-67. Further, we have also found that unhelmeted two-wheeler riders can sustain severe head injuries at speeds as low as 10 kmph. It is at low speeds that helmets are particularly effective. Therefore they are an ideal safety device for India where average speeds are not very high. It is imperative that helmet laws be enforced for motorcyclists immediately. Windshields in Indian cars are not laminated. Even the cars manufactured by Maruti Udyog Limited do not have laminated windshields installed in cars sold in India though the car technology has been acquired from Suzuki of Japan recently. This is twenty-five years after they became standard in Europe. The Maruti advertise ments (e.g. in Business India, Aug 17-30, 1992) mislead the consumers that their outdated technology is modern: 'The windscreens are made of "zone toughened" glass that fragment into rounded edges on impact, rather than jagged ones that could cause injury'. This statement is made when these windshields are not allowed in Japan and twenty-five years after it was shown that toughened glass windshields are much more hazardous than laminated windshields! Hazardous front surfaces of vehicles. Modern cars are being designed with 'softer' front ends and bonnets and no hood ornaments are allowed. This is to minimize head and other injuries in crashes with pedestrians. These designs are being defeated by car users adding rigid front guards to their, vehicles. These guards cannot protect the cars but can cause fatal head injuries to children at low velocity crashes. There is no move to ban such add-ons. Pedestrians and bicyclists constitute CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 65, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 1993 the majority of road crash victims in India. For this reason it is essential that standards be developed requiring all vehicles' fronts to be free of any rigid or sharp objects. Buses. Our studies show that a large proportion of bus commuters killed in Delhi are those who fall off buses68. All these deaths can be prevented if buses are equipped with doors. Pneumatic doors have been used successfully in other developing countries for years. In Delhi, the manufacturers of the recently introduced buses have been allowed to provide door-less buses on the excuse that the technology is too sophisticated! Playgrounds. Studies show that children can sustain serious injuries if they fall head first onto a rigid surface from heights as low as 2 m. This means that all playgrounds must not be paved with bricks or concrete. In addition, the area around swings, slides, climbing apparatus must have sand or gravel pits around 25 cm deep. No such directions have been issued to schools and housing societies. Boxing. It has been known for a long time that amateur boxing can result in long-term brain damage. When a boxer is 'knocked out' it means that he has Suffered concussion of the brain. This is a serious injury. Many schools still encourage children to take up boxing as a 'sport'. Parents are not informed that this has possibilities of resulting in permanent brain damage. It is this kind of politics of brain damage which may be resulting in more than 10,000 needless deaths and 100,000 serious injuries every year. Recommendations - All cars must be fitted with laminated windshields, seat belts and air bags. - Fronts of vehicles should not have any sharp or pointed objects. - All buses must be fitted with doors which must be closed when buses are in motion. - Children must not be placed in front seats of cars. - Bus designs must be developed which have more 'forgiving' fronts which are safer for pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. - Helmet use must be mandatory for all riders of motorized two-wheeler riders immediately. The law should be extended to bicyclists once inexpensive bicyclist helmets have been developed. - Boxing as a sport should not be allowed in schools.. - Playgrounds should not have paved surfaces. Guidelines for safe playground design should be formulated and circulated widely. 759</page><page sequence="12">REVIEW ARTICLE - Children should not be placed on high surfaces in homes. Preferably, they should be kept on the floor as far as possible or on low furniture. Use of rugs and mats reduces probability of severe head injury. Use of window guards reduces the incidence of children falling out. 1.
