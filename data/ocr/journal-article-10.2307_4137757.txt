<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEVERLY GORDON Embodiment, Community Building, and Aesthetic Saturation in "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space This case study focuses on a functioning campus bathroom that has been trans- formed into a sensually rich women's community space and explores how women have created meaning in a private context where their own norms prevail. The women have built an embodied environment, where ordinary objects are used to foster connectedness, expressiveness, and creativity. They value playfulness, good humor, and an aesthetically elaborated environment that caters to all body senses while expressing a nonconsumerist ethos. Introduction THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT of a particular "backstage" women's space, a small bathroom in the School of Human Ecology at the University of Wisconsin. While remaining a functioning institutional restroom serviced by regular janitorial staff, the room has over the past four years also become a distinctive community space, with gallery-like displays featuring artifacts of women's everyday lives. The space is sensually rich, with ever changing decorative displays and vignettes built from an array of objects, plants, and even food. It includes a comfortable lounge area with a stock of reading material, candy, and other give-away items and a guest book for patron commentary. The environment offers ongoing surprises, but the consistent message of the room is that women's lives should be celebrated. Regular users feel personally identified with the space because it gives them the sense of belonging to a lighthearted, private (though nonrestricted) women's club that exists within the serious and im- personal male-dominated university. "Restroom World," as the environment was dubbed by one of its patrons, has even become a rallying point for those who regu- larly use it. An examination of this self-contained "world" serves as a unique case study that illuminates a number of folkloric themes and allows us to look in depth at the way a group of women have built a separate "culture" and community. The study builds on the idea that there is such a thing as a "workday neighborhood," because the mem- BEVERLY GORDON is Professor, Department of Environment, Textiles, and Design and the Folklore Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison Journal ofAmerican Folklore 116(462):444-64 Copyright @ 2003 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 445 bers of this community work together in the same professional unit. It relates in some ways to the literature on office folklore, although this office neighborhood is unique: it is open only to women and exists in a particularly private or intimate arena that is not usually included in scholarly discourse (see Dundes 1983; Jones 1987:119-21; Swanson and Nusbaum 1979). A bathroom is clearly a backstage region where the need to keep up the usual social "front" is reduced (Goffman 1959:106-49). Any back- stage region may by definition provide a sense of relaxation and ease, but a restroom exists to deal with bodily needs and is thus inextricably tied to a sense of physical self. It is a place of "un-dress," where bodily functions and body image are primary con- cerns. Understandably, there is a kind of overlay in this situation between the room and the women who use and identify with it-it functions as a symbolic and, in some ways, literal extension of them. We can look, then, at Restroom World as a place where women's norms not only prevail, but also where women's "culture" is expressed un- abashedly (Hollis, Pershing, and Young 1993; Mitchell 1993; Radner and Lanser 1993). My study of this backstage environment points to a number of interrelated, inter- nally consistent themes that suggest a distinctive women's approach and relationship to objects, space, and one another. I do not claim this in any universalist sense; the women involved in this particular Restroom World are well educated, middle class, and disproportionately Caucasian early twenty-first-century Americans. Neverthe- less, their approach is consistent with that taken by women of diverse profiles and time periods who operate in their "own" domain. The patrons of Restroom World are women who also participate in the broader social and intellectual life of the culture of which they are a part, but in this relaxed environment, where social front does not matter, they do so in an embodied, holistic, and connected manner. The women value generosity and care about community-the local community of the bathroom us- ers, as well as the broader communities of which they are a part: the region (symboli- cally, "dairyland"), the community of women, and the national public community that shares political and popular culture as well as seasonal events and celebrations. They also value rather than dismiss everyday things and the routines of daily life; ordinary objects are the primary vehicle, in fact, with which they foster connected- ness, expressiveness, and creativity. The women express an attitude of playfulness and inclusive good humor and create an intense, aesthetically elaborated, or saturated, environment that caters to all body senses. They also express a nonconsumerist ethos, where what is valued is not based on money, status, or inherent value, but rather on the very qualities enumerated above. I have observed Restroom World since it first began to evolve into the idiosyncratic women's space it has become. I have also been a participant in its community. In any given workweek, I entered the room several times, choosing to use it rather than an- other facility. I would often sit on the couch, look at the reading material, touch the stuffed animals, or nibble on the provided candy. I perused the guest book entries, watched the behavior of others in the room, and engaged in casual conversation about the space with some of those who came in.' After about a year, I began to think more theoretically about what was unfolding and began to observe and collect data more systematically. I took notes on the myriad objects and displays and, in time, conducted a more formal material culture analysis.2 I also interviewed five of the central players</page><page sequence="3">446 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) at length and did a longitudinal content analysis of the guest book entries. Finally, I used visual (photographic) evidence to track ongoing developments. Happily, two of the other patrons had taken photographs of many of the first-year displays and shared them with me. These helped jog my memory of what I had seen previously, so I could compare the early displays with the ones I was documenting in later periods. Once I started turning my ethnographic eye to the bathroom space, I conscientiously took periodic photographs of my own. My observations and findings corroborate a number of established ideas about group identity and women's roles in American culture. (That is, it has been claimed that women are the keepers of calendar customs and bearers of tradition, the primary performers of social ritual, and the ones most identified with "gift relations" [Santino 1996].) My work also reinforces and builds upon previous work on the importance of the aesthetic dimension, emphasizing the inseparability of these enumerated themes and building a holistic conceptual framework about backstage, private women's spaces. Before exploring each of these themes in detail and showing how they work together, I will set the stage by offering a "thick" description of Restroom World and tracing its history and development (Geertz 1973). History and Description of Restroom World The restroom featured in this article as Restroom World is a long, narrow space located on an upper floor of a hundred-year-old building. It is in a hall with relatively low foot traffic, surrounded by offices. The quiet setting of the space and its small scale make it seem personal and safe, but it is nevertheless expansive, as the building is sited on a hill and the window at the end of the room looks out over treetops to the vista of Lake Mendota. The most functional section of the space, where a large wheelchair- accessible toilet stall and sink are located, is at this back end, but even this area has been transformed. The stall itself usually includes an arrangement of objects and images. Plants and other items spill over the windowsill and hand-dryers. The front part of the room functions as the lounge. It includes a couch, outfitted with at least one huggable stuffed animal, and a side table outfitted with items such as facial tis- sues and a changing selection of magazines and catalogues. A box of "freebie" items also sits in this area, and always in close reach is the leather-bound guest book, invit- ing individuals to comment on what is happening in the space. The walls are filled with hanging objects, pictures, and a changing selection of cartoons or newspaper articles. Horizontal surfaces are covered with objects worked into vignettes. The dis- plays are thematic, based, for example, on seasonal holidays or objects/concepts like "shoes." Everything is seen through a woman's eye. Among the typical cartoons are the female-oriented "Cathy" and "Sylvia" strips, and most of the books address women's issues. The gestalt of the room goes far beyond the usual decoration of office environments; while individual desks or cubicles are often personalized with items such as photographs and plants, and shared spaces often feature cartoons and sea- sonal ornaments, this room operates as a rest area rather than a workstation. Not surprisingly, it contains a proportionately greater number of ornaments and frivo- lous items.</page><page sequence="4">.......... . ... ...... .... ...... ..iiiiii~i!iiiiii~ii iii! i~ ~i~ii!!!~ iiiiiii! iii~i!i!ii~ ~~iiiiii~ i iiii~iiiii~ ~iiii Figure 1.

She continues to function as the primary "curator" of the space and its main "performer."3 She gen- erally conceives of and executes the displays and is responsible for procuring and ar- ranging the objects. Carol did not plan or envision the bathroom elaboration in ad- vance; the project started essentially by accident with a group of "seed objects."4 Carol was serving as executor of the estate of her late friend, Lenore, and was faced with the task of distributing her houseful of possessions. She was saddened by the idea that many of the things that had meant so much to Lenore would have little resale value, for, stripped of their emotional associations or psychic charge, they would be almost worthless (Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981). The broken pitcher that Lenore had lovingly patched, for example, would only be perceived as damaged goods, and Lenore's beloved down-filled couch would be seen as outdated and undesirable. Carol was motivated to find an appreciative home for such items, but she first thought to bring some into the work environment for a practical reason: one of her support staff was having health problems and occasionally needed a place to lie down. Carol directed the movers to deliver Lenore's couch to campus and then added a few other items, including a table and a selection of books. Notably, given the emphasis on the body that I argue is a salient part of Restroom World, the first reading matter related to cooking, diet issues, and body image. These first seed objects spawned others, and the space continued to evolve. Many of Lenore's items that did not sell made their way to the bathroom, and Carol brought things from home that would add to the ambiance. Those who were watching the room take shape also made contributions. After a while, Carol particularly began to seek additional items for the room, but she had a self-imposed "rule" that nothing could cost very much. The room essentially had to serve as a repository for recycled items. She decided the light from the overhead fluorescent fixtures was too glaring and a stand-alone lamp would help create a homey atmosphere, but she forced her- self to wait until she found a used one for $3.50. She was pleased, also, with the cracked chamber pot that she picked up at an estate sale. Its flaw made it worthless for its in- tended purpose, but it would be a perfect plant holder for the toilet stall, where, jux- taposed against the modern bowl, it would serve as an amusingly subtle punning commentary on the evolution of bodily hygiene. The guest book, which had belonged to Lenore, was among the earliest items in the room. Carol removed the few previously used pages and placed the book on a cloth- covered stool, creating an almost throne-like setting for it. The first entries simply consisted of visitors' names, but within a week someone wrote "the best loo in the building" and signed it "the Queen Mother." In no time, others got into the act with their own pseudonymous satirical commentary. Patrons soon joined in the "perfor- mance" of the bathroom, in other words, participating in this silent (written) kind of speech. Most took on female personas-Madonna (who cautioned everyone not to cry for her); Hillary Clinton and Monica; Mrs. Santa; Betty Crocker; and, of course, Martha Stewart, who proclaimed that she had been "outdone" with this space. Many of the entries responded to previous comments, forming what one bathroom fre- quenter characterized as "call-and-response" interactions. In reaction to a remark that</page><page sequence="6">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 449 the couch was "great for a quickie," for example, "Miss Manners" replied in red ink, "Tsk, tsk. Privacy here is limited. Don't bother us!" Puns and humor were a consis- tent part of these interchanges. One consisted of the comment that the room "should be in the 'Best of Madison' list," followed by the response, "Yes, [in the category] 'where to go in Madison!'"5 The thematic displays that turned the bathroom into a quasi-gallery themselves often grew from a seed object or idea. Based on some of Lenore's items (she had led 4-H and homemaker's clubs), Carol's first installation related to women's domestic work. The artifacts ranged from pictures of women trussing chickens to copies of old home management manuals, and Carol visually tied the elements together with Lenore's favorite green color, thereby reinforcing the point that the installation was an homage to her friend. A "June Dairy Month" theme was similarly inspired by a bovine image in one of Lenore's designer fabrics. Carol let her imagination run wild with that topic: she suspended an inflatable cow over the toilet, paraded miniature rubber cows along the top of the couch and toilet paper dispenser, and mounted amusing pictures-including Martha Stewart with a milk mustache. In time, the dairy or cow theme took on a life of its own, to the point that there are usually cows in evi- dence at all times of the year, and I have come to think of the cow as the Restroom World mascot. The cow imagery holds particular resonance in Wisconsin, which is known as "the Dairy State," and reinforces the idea fondly.6 Also relevant to this women's space is the fact that the state sponsors yearly contests for a kind of whole- some, commercial beauty queen, "Alice in Dairyland." During the first Dairy Month display, "Alice" wrote a tongue-in-cheek guest book entry, as did another female dairy icon, "Elsie Borden." The entries not only continued the tradition of the female per- sona that had been established with other performative characters, but also played with their embodied commercial symbols and implicit associations with health, nur- turing, and motherhood. Eventually, artwork served as the seed object for another elaborate and much-ap- preciated theme that related directly to women's bodies. The shoe installation was in- spired by-and included-a poster that was part of Gaza Bowen's satirical sculpture, "Shoes for the Little Lady." There was a personal connection, because Bowen had been a visiting instructor in the school and actually used the restroom, but her little lady shoes also provided relevant commentary on women's work, because they were made from household cleaning supplies such as toilet brushes and sponges. Carol then went off to find other women's shoes, making special trips to second-hand stores, for ex- ample, to find pink or chartreuse dress pumps that would match images she had found on art cards. She arranged this footwear carefully, setting it off with fabric much like a display in a shoe store window. She also placed the New York Times Magazine on the couch, open to a page featuring glittery painted toenails. This subtle detail escaped the conscious awareness of bathroom patrons, who tidily closed the magazine, but Carol repeatedly reopened it to the correct page to maintain the integrity of the display. She claims her greatest "find" for the shoe installation was a mannequin's leg originally used as a store display for stockings. She positioned it next to the toilet (in subsequent exhibitions, it appeared in other locations). As a response to this installation, "Imelda M." inquired in the guest book if there were a need for additional shoes.</page><page sequence="7">450 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) . . ...... . .i-_.~ii :- ii :i A4, _~-2~. .. ...... ... . .. .... ... .. ..... .... ... .. . xv... . . .. .... .. -::--:--...... .... i . ... .. V ':-" ... .........---:i-:- .... Figure 3. The mannequin's leg was usually outfitted with women's shoes, but in this display it was posited as a "living" element (complete with plants), contrasted with old film reel containers. Holiday vignettes were-and remain-equally imaginative, drawing strongly on images from popular culture. Notably, the celebrated holidays are those that fall dur- ing the academic year and have distinctive visual associations as seasonal markers. The chosen holidays are ones where women play a primary role in the celebration and that are celebrated primarily in the home rather than in the public or political arena. (This observation is consistent with Jack Santino's claims that the celebration of annual calendrical festivals can be thought of as "part of the domestic cultural property of women" [1996:159].) Thus, Restroom World displays are tied to Halloween, Thanks- giving, Christmas, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, and Easter, but not Martin Luther King's Birthday, President's Day, or Labor Day. Though many celebrations in this list have a religious context, they are exclusively Christian; minority events such as Ha- nukkah, Kwanza, or Asian New Year are not acknowledged. The holidays are treated more as seasonal markers than spiritual ones, however, because the displays include</page><page sequence="8">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 451 no religious content. Easter displays are about spring and rebirth; Christmas displays focus on secular symbols such as decorated trees and Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Rein- deer. In an early Christmas display, for example, Carol featured reindeer whose ant- lers were made from baby bottle nipples. At Easter, she set up a tableaux of stuffed rabbits. These were positioned under the greenery of large, leafy plants and were posed around a dish of jellybeans, as if they were nibbling on seasonal treats. There was "audience participation" in this display as well. One of Carol's colleagues-a Restroom World regular-added to the vignette by strategically placing a few raisins behind the animals. Her contribution communicated that the rabbits had indeed eaten their food and subsequently deposited "droppings." The thematic displays in Restroom World changed about once a month during its first year, but the turn-around time slowed over time. (At present, in fact, there are often eclectic rather than strictly thematic displays.) The seasonal themes repeat, and some of the items thus make regular return appearances. Nevertheless, and even when a thematic installation continues for a few months, it is never static; even within a given thematic "run," Carol often makes small changes from one day to the next. She usu- ally works on the displays in the evening, so Restroom World users are greeted with surprises when they enter the room. Regulars sometimes make special trips to see what might have been placed there overnight.7 Approximately a year after Restroom World's elaboration began, some of the items in the displays began to disappear. Miniature Teletubby dolls were taken from a well- loved installation on the lounge-area table, and, subsequently, a book entitled Seven Weeks to Better Sex was removed from the toilet stall. Carol expressed that she was mildly disturbed by that loss, but that her feelings were tempered by the "great" sign she posted in response: "You have seven weeks to return the book and we'll expect the full written report." Carol's real sense of betrayal, however, came when several large and particularly beautiful plants-some of which she had nurtured in her garden- were stolen. Her response was to remove most of the artifacts from the bathroom. The couch remained, but the teddy bear that invariably sat on it was taken away, the books and magazines disappeared, and the walls were stripped. The rather ordinary insti- tutional room suddenly seemed barren, and frequenters cried out in protest. For weeks there were comments in the guest book like, "What a disappointment! What hap- pened?" "Theft! Who wounded the women's room muse?" "The changes here are heartbreaking!" and "It saddens me to think that someone ... took something away from everyone." Perhaps the most powerful response came from the person who wrote, "I can't understand how anyone (man or woman) can desecrate this wonder- ful, powerful, woman's space. How dare you!"' After about six weeks, Carol's sense of betrayal faded, and she stopped trying to resist the fact that she drew great pleasure from creating the environment and interacting with others through it. Objects started reappearing in the room, and before long they were once again worked into thematic installations. Guest book commentators indi- cated their delight with pictures of happy faces and entries such as: "Thank you so much-it was a joy walking into this sacred space again," "TRUST... let's not lose it again or it may be lost forever," "So glad the beauty is back in the bathroom!" and "Life is back in this room! Thanks!" One of the regular patrons then posted a sign</page><page sequence="9">452 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) warning that the room was "watched over by God"; hence, anyone who abused it "had better watch out." A similar sign remains to this day. Exploration of Emergent Themes One of the most salient characteristics of Restroom World is its sense of intimacy, "coziness," and ease. I suggest that this stems from its embodied quality. Not only is it a place where the body is central, even celebrated, but the space itself is a "dressed" entity that functions as a kind of extended communal body for regular patrons. The women involved with the space interact with it as part of themselves; they not only use it, but intimately identify with it. The concept of embodiment has recently made its way into diverse academic discourse- folklorists have addressed it, as have those concerned with issues of psychology (including cognition and learning theory), neu- rophysiology, philosophy and religion, feminist theory, media studies, art, and the nature and experience of culture. Beginning in the 1950s, when French phenomenolo- gist Maurice Merleau-Ponty first insisted on locating consciousness in the body (Gill 1991), there has been a growing understanding that physical form mediates all indi- vidual and cultural experience, while the body, in turn, is understood as a biological entity that is affected by cultural phenomena (see Bermudez, Marcel, and Eilan 1995; Csordas 2001; Davis 1997; Douglas 1973; Lakoff and Johnson 1999; Ullrich 1999; Weiss and Haber 1999; Welton 1998). Folklorist Katherine Young coined the word "bodylore" to locate the body as a legitimate field of folkloric inquiry (1993:vii), and the first papers to address the topic were presented at the American Folklore Society annual meeting in 1989. Young's statement that the "sense of corporeality... serves as a benchmark, a common frame through which people seek to understand them- selves and the world in which they move" (1994:43) beautifully expresses one of the dynamics of Restroom World, which, I believe, is especially framed by corporeal ex- perience. I draw upon the rich literature on bodylore and embodiment, but I am also taking the topic in a new direction, applying embodiment to a human-altered space. The space not only mirrors the people who are involved, but also becomes an extension of them; it functions as a stage on which they project themselves, but the room also takes on a "body" of its own. Russell Belk and his collaborators developed the idea that collections serve as extensions of self for their owners (1988:29). Insofar as Restroom World is a shared collection, that concept is relevant, although I am also using "the body" in a different and more literal sense.9 This theme is succinctly illus- trated in this case study-a point that came home to me when I heard one user say about the bathroom, "It's something you relate to bodily; it hits you as a physical thing." According to the Oxford English Dictionary, to "embody" is to give concrete form to something that is otherwise only abstract or an ideal; it means "clothing" some- thing evanescent with a body. Secondary definitions include imparting "a material,. ..sensual character to;" coalescing, uniting, or forming into one body; and giving "life" to, as in painting with a full body of color (OED 2001). All these definitions relate to Restroom World, which serves as a sensually and aesthetically rich, concrete expres-</page><page sequence="10">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 453 sion of the women's shared experience and sense of self. The quality of embodiment is particularly strong, I believe, because a major element of the shared experience is itself physical. Women tend to be attuned to their bodies because of their biological cycles and the dramatic changes and sensations of childbearing; their sense of self is a somatic one. Women's bonding or sense of connection, in turn, is based in part on their shared physical experience. In their private backstage spaces where they can re- lax a bit about their social front, women often focus, nevertheless, on the body. They talk about body experiences, dwell (sometimes negatively) on body image, or focus on grooming (sometimes of one another). This is certainly evident in Restroom World. Any bathroom exists to serve bodily needs, but this embellished, elaborated space goes far beyond functional acceptance; it not only reflects a level of comfort with the body, unabashedly embracing it, but is also a space to discuss and interrogate the concepts of "body." Young noted in her introduction to Bodylore that, when women present themselves publicly, they often either suppress evidence of the grotesque or "lower" body (the part involving sex, death, life, and perceived filth), or they create an image of an ethereal, ideal body (1993:xix).'0 This is decidedly not the case in the private, backstage space of Restroom World; among themselves, the women "tell different stories" and adopt different, seemingly more "authentic," attitudes (Radner and Lanser 1993:76). The somatic focus was evident from the inception of RestroomWorld: the couch was first provided for bodily comfort. Later additions such as facial tissues, indirect lighting, and teddy bears addressed comfort in other ways. Messages about body image were part of the first displays. Books, cartoons, and visual images relating to menstrua- tion, sex, and women's health have been present throughout, as have artifacts relat- ing to "undressed" bodies. Wall posters that have had the longest "run" (i.e., have remained through different thematic installations) include turn-of-the-century ad- vertising images featuring (allegorical) bare-breasted women or not-yet-dressed chil- dren or adults. Carol has also repeatedly showcased an actual undergarment, a silky, full-body 1930s corset that functions as a kind of iconic female presence. She most often hangs it in the toilet stall-the most personal body space of the entire room- as part of a seasonal display. Originally laced with strands of beads, it bore the sign, "What the well-dressed woman will wear for Halloween." Restroom World visitors responded gleefully and wrote comments such as, "Loungerie [sic] in the lounge!" (Purported cross-dressers "Marv Albert and J. Edgar Hoover" even asked to borrow it.) Recently, a bikini has been hanging in the same spot. It is covered with a jacket in the winter, but still clearly alludes to the barely dressed body. Images of undressed bodies also appeared on a separate occasion in relation to a bicycling theme. Carol mounted century-old posters with diaphanously clad female bicyclists as well as more contemporary photographs of a local nude bike race. As implied above, the attitude expressed by both Carol and the women who share Restroom World is that they seek a place where they can feel at home with their bod- ies and happy to be in a space where they can share that ease with others. Many guest book comments refer straightforwardly to urination and bodily function, and, though some are blunt, none has been "dirty" or otherwise disrespectful. "This is a true la- dies' lounge," wrote one visitor; "I can't wait to come back and take a piss!" Others</page><page sequence="11">454 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) spoke of the "comfy can," or "beautiful john," pointing out that women "deserve" such spaces. Jane Przybysz's idea of a "reclaiming of the female body as a self-sufficient, sensuous and desiring source of pleasure"(1993:177) certainly seems to fit here, and, given the guest book emphasis on comfort and sensations like urination, it is significant that Prsybysz particularly identifies the bodily pleasure as a tactile one. The same kind of self-confidence, ease, and sense of entitlement is evident in guest book comments that gently mock assumptions of male superiority. One reference, face- tiously attributed to Sigmund Freud, referred to "too much peanut envy"; another repeated the familiar analogy likening a woman without a man to a fish without a bicycle. Preoccupation with the male body was also ridiculed in commentary that followed the appearance of the well- known satirical "expose yourself to art" poster in the toilet stall. Embodiment is further evident in the fact that the room itself is a "dressed" en- tity-the space and the objects within it are "clothed" or "dressed up." I have devel- oped the idea in my earlier work (Gordon 1996) that rooms, like people, are said to have "countenances" or "personalities;" like individuals, they can be "freshened up" or given "make-overs." The embellishments that Carol brings into the room help it come alive and take on its particular persona, which I characterize as the users' com- munal female self. The space may wear different costumes according to the changing seasons or occasions-i.e., according to its changing installation-but as long as it is dressed, it still functions as an animate place. (Remember that, according to the guest book, the "life" went out of the room when its objects were removed.) There are many factors contributing to the animation that occurs in this local women's space. Individual objects are made more alive, for example, through con- textual framing or costuming. When the bunnies were posed in a tableaux with shrub- bery and jellybean food, they seemed more animate, and the living quality was en- hanced even further with the addition of raisin rabbit droppings. Positioning the corset in an upright fashion and draping it with beads animated it in a similar man- ner. I consider the corset installation to be a costuming of the room itself, but some of the individual objects are themselves also costumed. Stuffed animals may change outfits with the season; the teddy bear on the couch, for instance, dons a green hat for St. Patrick's Day and rabbit-eared sunglasses for Easter. A small cactus plant some- times wears a miniature cheesehead (a humorous symbol of dairyland Wisconsin), and other plants may be dressed up with bows. At times, also, clothing items or ac- cessories stand alone, representing in effect the full woman's body. The corset is one example of this, but the shoes and shapely mannequin's leg functioned in the same way. In addition, the space is rife with three-dimensional representations of living (embodied) things, all of which seem to have personalities of their own. The bear is a constant presence, joined at times by other stuffed animals such as lambs or rabbits and by other dolls and miniatures. A list of those that have already been mentioned- Teletubbies, large inflatable or miniature rubber cows, and nipple-antlered reindeer- indicates how they also add an animated quality. Finally, the space always includes plants-real living things-that are often integrated into the tableaux. In one instal- lation, the plant kingdom even seemed to subvert the technological world. Discarded computers were set up as plant supports and disappeared beneath the foliage; it</page><page sequence="12">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 455 seemed that they had been subsumed into the biological entity of the bathroom. It is significant, too, that the plant theft is what most distressed Carol and led her to aban- don the room temporarily. Guest book comments tell us that the living items, or those that take on a living quality, are also the ones that seem to have the most resonance and emotional power for Restroom World users.I The second theme I posit is that the women involved in Restroom World value and cultivate interpersonal connection, communication, and a sense of community. The female visitors to this room are empathetic and identify with one another. These qualities were evident from the inception of the space, when Carol brought the couch in to both provide for an ailing colleague and share Lenore's energy with others. Carol's ongoing concern for others' needs is evident in objects such as an alarm clock (provided for students who want to take a quick nap before class), as well as the amus- ing clippings and cartoons she mounts across from the toilet (provided to entertain those who are "on the pot"). The theme of community seems to be consciously on Carol's mind as well. Tellingly, when a colleague (a Restroom World regular) got married, Carol inscribed her name and the words "welcome to community property" on mylar balloons. Filled with helium, they bobbed cheerfully over the couch for days. As Restroom World evolved, Carol's original impetus to share Lenore's legacy be- came the vehicle through which she could share her own ebullient energy and bond or connect more fully with her colleagues. The sense of connection, however, is not one way; it is the shared experience of the space that makes it meaningful to all those who use it. The opportunities for interactive (albeit asynchronous, indirect) commu- nication that were provided from the outset allow everyone to feel that they too are actors or participants, even though Carol acts as primary curator. There are numer- ous indications that users perceive it as a shared space and that it helps bond a broader women's community. A secretary happily told me, for example, that she has more interaction with students as well as faculty because the restroom has given them a leveling space in which to connect. Even more telling is the fact that at a faculty re- treat in 2001, when each department in the school was asked to identify what made it strong and unique, Carol's unit immediately named the women's bathroom. (The male faculty and graduate students have been given special "guided tours" so that they do not feel totally excluded.) The sense of community is also evident in the lack of one-upmanship in the guest book commentary. Rather, one entry builds on another in the call-and-response format mentioned above. The humor is always gentle and inclusive, and every patron can feel part of the particular discussion and the overall "secret" of the bathroom, just by virtue of being a woman. The many references in the room to women's history and shared experiences also help newcomers feel wel- come and part of the community. One reason the thefts affected everyone so strongly, I believe, is that there was a sense that women had betrayed their own kind or that their shared intimacy had been invaded by an "outsider." Even though many of the interactions in the restroom are asynchronous, the women's community would not be felt as strongly without a group of real individu- als to anchor and nurture it. There are real faces that lie behind the "Madonnas" who write in the guest book, and Restroom World regulars are both aware and apprecia- tive of Carol's generous personal contributions, as well as those by others. Over time,</page><page sequence="13">456 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) also, the mere presence of such an unexpected and "female" space in the halls of aca- deme-one that is "hidden" behind a closed door-has helped cement the feeling of a special female community within the school. It is the sense of connection or bond- ing within the group of regulars that makes the space "work." We can understand this by contrasting what happened with a kind of "copycat" embellished space that emerged in the same building. Inspired by the creative happenings upstairs, one of the female night-shift janitors tried a similar installation, placing stuffed animals and dried flowers in a much bigger bathroom on a lower floor. Where there did not seem to be any underlying concern for individuals or forms of interactive dialogue, the objects seemed slightly too cute (at least to me) and intrusive. Perhaps because they held no personal resonance to any of the users of that room, they were received as mere "decoration." The large scale and more public setting of that space, and the fact that there was no organic reason for the space to be commandeered as it was, also affected the different reaction. With no positive feedback or community to sustain it, the decorative material was soon withdrawn.12 The seasonal cycle of holiday decorations in the restroom also contributes to the bathroom users' sense of community. Santino argues that holidays give us a "lan- guage" with which we can communicate with others; holiday decorations, in particu- lar, can be used to help bring people into our community. He speaks of decorating the outside of our houses as a way of involving passers-by to view our life cycle ritu- als, extending the circle of witnesses and participants beyond the immediate family that lives inside (1994:34, 39). The seasonal displays of the restroom work in a simi- lar fashion, helping the community of users feel like a family. They also reinforce the sense that this particular small group exists within a broader, national community or culture that is represented by each of them. The impulse to elaborate and transform the space expressed by both Carol and the other regular visitors to the restroom relates to the interwoven themes of creative expression, playfulness, and aesthetic saturation. The Restroom World installations especially serve as a creative outlet for Carol. Working on the room makes her feel good-so much so she admits that even as she was removing items after the thefts, she knew in her heart that she "would start up again" so as not to be deprived of this avenue of expression. Once involved with the project, she began to "see everything through the eyes of the bathroom" (note the anthropomorphic-embodied-nature of that image) and assessed items that crossed her path in terms of their usefulness for future installations. Her behavior changed accordingly; she began to make spe- cial trips to secondhand stores and garage sales on the off-chance that she would find something "perfect" for future displays. The project gives shape to her experiences, in other words, and helps her make the kind of new connections and juxtapositions that are understood to be the very definition of creativity (Arieti 1976:4). Other com- munity members were in turn also able to see things with fresh eyes. One spoke of the delight she felt upon encountering arrangements that "she never would have thought of." She mentioned the reindeer with nipple antlers, for example, and marsh- mallow chickens used anthropomorphically in an Easter display. She claimed she was now looking at every object in her kitchen, wondering what else she might creatively "turn it into."</page><page sequence="14">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 457 An attitude of playfulness and spontaneity is also identified as a component of the creative process (Kneller 1965:77-8). In the restroom, this attitude is heightened by the central presence of "childish" things, including cartoons, toys, and miniatures. Toys bring us back to our playful selves and allow us to feel happy and relaxed.13 Scholars have argued, furthermore, that when we deal with miniatures, we enter a different emotional state: we feel a sense of reverie and timelessness, as well as a comforting feeling of mastery and control (Bachelard 1994 [1958]:6-10; DeLong 1981; Stewart 1993:46). The restroom also sets up an altered relationship with the everyday objects (even edibles) that are usually associated with work: in this environment, they become associated with play. Consequently, "work" itself is transformed or redefined and imbued with good feeling. Carol first introduced the playful attitude, but it is shared by others in the ways, for example, the guest book commentators are quick to take on their own amusing personas and remark on what is happening-either within the bathroom space or out in the "serious" world around them-through the lighthearted filter of their shared community. The good feeling of the space is also related to the sense of aliveness it engenders. It is an aesthetically and sensually rich environment-it caters to, and helps awaken, the full range of bodily senses. Not only is it visually dense, filled with color and en- gaging imagery in every direction, but it is a tactile place-there is a soft couch to sink into, animals to hug, fabrics to slide under one's fingers; there are the textures and sensations of foliage, rubber toys, and plastic beads. There are different odors as well, including at times the musty smell of old books, the fresh smell of living plants (in- cluding, in spring, an overpowering scent of narcissus), and the artificial smell of room deodorizer. The sense of taste is honored with seasonal candies and the implied flavors of foods such as pineapples that are used as decorations. This high level of sensory stimulation is unusual in the work environment, and it is one of the reasons that Restroom World has become a "bodily experience." I have previously articulated the concept of a "saturated world," a created reality that is aesthetically charged and full. I think of saturation in terms of color-a satu- rated hue is at its brightest, most intense level, and in its purest form-but anything that is saturated has absorbed the ultimate amount of its medium. A saturated world is thus a rich one; it is sensually charged, and everything in it seems extra-alive. My earlier writings explore historical situations in which women intentionally cultivated the saturated quality by infusing their lives with sensory input, and I see the same pattern at work in Restroom World (Gordon 1998). I find it significant, also, that Carol talked admiringly about the multisensory home theater productions Lenore had once produced. Carol was not only inspired to create an environment that similarly focused on sensory stimulation and elaboration, but she was moved to share it with an ap- preciative audience of other women. In The Taste of Ethnographic Things: The Senses and Anthropology, Paul Stoller remarked that "visualism"--the privileging of the sense of sight-"can be a Eurocentric mistake" in ethnographic inquiry (1989:9).14 I cer- tainly agree, but take his idea a step further. Because women, even within European- based cultures, tend to be so insistent on sensory input, I argue that visualism can be a phallocentric mistake as well if other sensory impulses are ignored. The aesthetically/sensually saturated world is also an emotional one. In his insis-</page><page sequence="15">458 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) tence on "tasteful fieldwork," Stoller also argued for the inclusion of "passions, sen- timents, fears and doubts" in anthropological inquiry (1989:51), implying that there is inevitably an overlay or congruence between the sensual and emotional. I also looked at this relationship when I applied Edward Hall's proxemic framework for human behavior to a consideration of people's relationship with objects (Gordon 1997). Decades ago, Hall empirically identified four "distance zones" in which behav- ior takes place. He observed that each zone involves different kinds of sensory input and response and elicits different behaviors. In the nearer "intimate" and "personal" zones, he demonstrated there is a particularly strong reliance on the senses of touch and smell, and people experience a higher degree of emotional involvement. The far- ther "social" and "public" zones are dominated by the visual sense, and behavior is more "detached" (Hall 1969:111-25). I suggested in my 1997 work that there are gender ramifications to these zones. Due to different socialization practices, it has been argued that often it is the women in our culture who are most at home in the nearer distances where the emotional response is salient and other, multiple senses are val- ued.'5 I have also argued that our relationship with objects varies accordingly in the different zones. Our response to things is more emotional in the nearer distances, for example, because we take them in through the nonvisual senses. The nearer zones are also where we find the kind of small, highly detailed objects that our culture tends to characterize as "fussy" and "feminine"; in order to be appreciated, such objects have to be experienced from this close perspective. It is not surprising, then, that minia- tures are so prevalent in the intimate space of the restroom or that it is a place where emotionalism is allowed and sensory stimulation is paramount. It is a women's space, a space that expresses and reflects women's experience and values. The last theme I want to identify in relation to Restroom World is a nonconsumerist ethos, where value is not based on inherent monetary worth, but on human connec- tion, aesthetic meaning, and the capacity to increase playfulness and good feeling. I have described the way the space serves as a home-a container or body, if you will-- for discarded items that otherwise would have lost their personal meaning. Castoffs are given new "lives" in Restroom World. In Carol's eyes, such recycling keeps down the number of items that make their way into landfills, but ecological consciousness is only a small part of the story. I see her attitude as a form of empathy and caretak- ing that extends even to artifacts. Moreover, Carol's self-imposed rules help integrate the objects into the community. Not only does she feel that the only legitimate items to bring to the room are those that are "close to free," but she has created geographic restrictions for them. She does not allow herself to patronize all garage sales to find Restroom World items; only those that are on her route to work are acceptable. This delimitation allows her to keep spending in check, but it also means that the items in the room belong to a certain territory-the one where she spends her life and has her relationships. The objects in the room, then, are as much a part of the community as the people who come in and respond to them. (Her limiting rules also add to the cre- ative challenge involved in constructing the vignettes, of course, and add to the thrill of finding just the right item by increasing the odds against it.) In a broader sense, Restroom World challenges the rules of consumer society. The space is kept outside the crass consumer world where everything has a price. It is a</page><page sequence="16">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 459 place with free candy and items to take home-i.e., goods are literally given away in this environment. Consumer products and salesmanship are also recast: advertising posters become a part of women's shared story rather than the mercenary environ- ment, and a shoe store-like installation becomes a commentary on uncomfortable but aesthetically pleasing female footwear rather than a mechanism for selling. Ser- vices are also given away in the restroom, for patrons' needs are anticipated and pro- vided for. Physical needs are accommodated, but emotional/psychic needs, such as humor, sensory pleasure, and a sense of female community are also addressed. Be- cause it is perceived as existing outside the mercenary world, the space is experienced as special, or "sacred." Guest book entries used this term after the thefts; individuals were expressing their shock at the fact that "profane" values such as selfishness and greed had intruded upon their space. How could things be stolen when they were offered for free? Restroom World has its own rules, therefore, which usually reverse those of the consumer society. Much of this discussion about the nonconsumerist ethos can be understood through a framework already established in the anthropological and material culture literature, especially in terms of "gift theory." To use that language, patrons' relation- ships with objects in the restroom are characterized by "gift" rather than "commod- ity relations." In a gift transaction, an object seems personal because it is conceptu- ally linked to the giver, the recipient, and the bond between them. In a commodity transaction, an object remains impersonal "property"; it is not significantly linked to any human relationship and is thus "alienated" or unconnected (Carrier 1995:11). Even a mass-produced, purchased object may lose its commodity status, but it must be "appropriated," or converted into a "possession." A sweater sitting on a store shelf remains a commodity, for example, until it is purchased by an individual, who invests energy in it. It then becomes identified with that person. If given as a gift, the sweater loses its commodity past when it is subordinated to the emotions and intentions of the giver and the relationship between the giver and receiver. (In the restroom, all objects are given as gifts.) James Carrier argues that women in our culture have pri- mary responsibility for the appropriation or conversion of commodities, because they are most strongly identified with nurturing interpersonal relationships. It is in the private sphere, which is still disproportionately associated with women, also, where relationships of reciprocity and generosity are strongest and where gift relations pre- vail (Carrier 1995:117, 172, 175; see also Vaughan 1997). The women associated with the restroom have commandeered a space in the public sphere and imbued it with the qualities of "their" private realm of gift relations. In other words, they appropri- ated both a group of commodities and an entire environment, turning them into relationship-oriented possessions. The appropriation of the first-floor bathroom was unsuccessful because there were no interpersonal relationships involved; hence, the objects placed there remained alienated commodities. Connections and Conclusions Several colleagues who heard I was writing about the women's shared bathroom in our building expressed surprise. What meaningful things could I say about a space filled</page><page sequence="17">460 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) with stuffed animals, cheeseheads, and other "childish" items-an "overdone" space with ordinary and sometimes "kitschy" objects crowding every surface? It was amus- ing, yes, but was it not rather silly, a kind of inside joke, and certainly not a subject of serious scholarly inquiry? In fact, it is the very elaborated, outside-the-"real"-world quality of this space and its abundance of small, "trivial" objects that interest me. I have spent my career studying such seemingly unimportant spaces and things, usually in relation to women's lives and the domestic domain. The themes I have identified in Restroom World are familiar; the same values and attitudes emerged, for example, in my study of women's charity bazaars (Gordon 1998). Bazaars are also based on giv- ing and sharing: they generally exist in order to raise money for worthy causes (i.e., for others) and often rely on volunteer time and energy. They persist even when they seem inefficient because they contribute so strongly to a sense of community and fel- lowship. Like Restroom World, bazaar spaces in the pre-World War I era were aestheti- cally elaborated, saturated environments, and working on them was an important cre- ative outlet for the women who fashioned them. Those spaces, too, were embodied and dressed (fairgivers even dressed themselves to match their bazaar spaces), and they were filled with playful, imaginary vignettes. There too, the women's approach was affirmative and people oriented. It is telling that these attitudes have persisted despite the profound changes in women's lives in the last century. The individuals involved with Restroom World-professional academics, secretaries and staff, and students, all with full participation in the public world-are doing similar things in their backstage appropriated space as the individuals from an earlier age who were primarily confined to an "allowable" "woman's sphere." When we take these spaces seriously on their own terms, or look with real interest and curiosity at this alternate paradigm, we are led to a richer understanding of the ways all of us may create meaning and good feeling in our lives. The paradigm is ho- listic. The attitudes and themes I have identified are interconnected and inseparable; together, they create a gestalt. The playfulness of the bazaars or the restroom is insepa- rable, for example, from an emphasis on creative expression. Restroom World's instal- lations are Carol's expressive form. In turn, their novel, playful juxtapositions stimu- late others' imaginations and expressiveness; through them, users feel the expansiveness of new possibility. The interlocking nature of these themes is also supported by theo- rists who have specifically tied play to aesthetic expression. Ernst Grosse equated art and play as long ago as 1897 (cited in Jones 1987:127), and the relationship was touched upon again in Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens (Man the Player) (1949). Play, aesthetic expression, and creativity have also been connected by more recent writers. For ex- ample, Diane Ackerman (1999:6, 12-4, 31) insists that we must cultivate a state of "deep" play to feel whole. (Tellingly, many of the qualities of deep play that Ackerman identifies, including the elements of surprise and uncertainty, lighthearted illusion, and make-believe, are evident in Restroom World.) Ellen Dissanayake (1988, 1992) writes about the origins of art and our human need to "make special" to add order and in- tensity to our world. Both "making special" and "deep play" are experienced through creative activity. Jones (1987:127) also insists that even when people are at "work," they invariably approach their tasks with a sense of play and artistic creativity. The connection between the aesthetic domain and everyday experience is articu-</page><page sequence="18">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 461 lated by Yi-Fu Tuan, who calls the aesthetic "the emotional-aspirational core"of hu- man experience (1993:23, 36-41). In ways that are obviously relevant to our discus- sion of Restroom World, he makes the connection between the aesthetic and sensory stimulation by defining the aesthetic impulse as "the senses come to life." He also writes of ways we find aesthetic meaning in mundane daily tasks and maintains that aesthetic experiences are most common in the home. I similarly argue that aesthetic concerns are particularly "allowable" in the domestic sphere-the domain that in Western culture has been most closely associated with women (Gordon, unpublished manuscript). Women are also associated with the aesthetic and the bodily senses; we often hear women referred to as the "sensitive" ones. With these interlocking ideas, we can better understand and appreciate how sensory stimulation, aesthetic satura- tion, and a focus on everyday experience function as hallmarks of the "domesticated" environment of Restroom World.16 There are interfaces among still more of our intertwined themes, including the nonconsumerist ethos, interpersonal connection, and aesthetic saturation. We have established that women and the domestic sphere are disproportionately linked with gift relations and that women tend to use objects to further their personal relation- ships and strengthen their sense of community. As Carrier admits, his profession has only recently begun to look seriously at the private sphere in the West; in his work he emphasizes the importance of situating objects in their "interpersonal private struc- tures of social relationship"(1995:7-8). This study takes a step in that direction, but it adds another variable. Restroom World shows us how aestheticization can function as a mechanism of object appropriation/personalization. I am convinced that this is a common process, especially in private or backstage environments. I believe that re- searchers interested in objects and social relationships will find it fruitful to ask ques- tions about the ways objects are used to create aesthetic stimulation and meaning. The playful, aesthetically saturated environment of the restroom contributes also to the sense of confidence and belonging (community) its individual patrons expe- rience. The high level of sensory stimulation and the seemingly disconnected items arranged and recontextualized in gallery-like installations help patrons feel excited but relaxed, powerful but emotionally engaged. The female visitors to this room are bonded by their shared bodily experience and are further empowered by feeling part of a community of insiders. In sum, each of the enumerated themes--embodiment, interpersonal connection, aesthetic/sensory saturation, playfulness and expressiveness, and a nonconsumerist approach-is an integral part of the way women have shaped an environment and built community in this backstage, domesticized context. I have cited recent scholarship to support the idea that each of these qualities adds meaning to human life, but what emerges from this case study is the necessity of considering the themes together. None of them exists in isolation; it is the holism of the women's embodied approach that allows visitors to find Restroom World "the happiest spot on campus!" The women bring together rather than compartmentalize: they conflate space and body, work and play, objects and relationships, discarded items and art, seriousness and humor. They care about forging connections with one another, and they care about, make creative use of, and connect with the objects and other aspects of the tangible world.</page><page sequence="19">462 Journal of American Folklore 116 (2003) Notes 1. In this sense, I was engaging in what anthropologist Paul Stoller refers to as "tasteful fieldwork." He maintains that ethnographic research should "describe with literary vividness the smells, tastes, and tex- tures" of the environment (1989:29). 2. For a good overview of this methodology, see Jules David Prown (1982) and Prown and Kenneth Haltman (2000). 3. Richard Bauman (1972:33) argues that there may well be main actors or performers in any folk group; although different members of the group have a stake in the shared experience, they need not all have the same stake, or an equivalent level role in its perpetuation. Carol remains the restroom community's primary performer, although her performance is indirect, in that it is expressed silently, through objects. She lets the displays "speak" for her and rarely talks to bathroom users directly about their experience. Michael Owen Jones uses the term "material behavior" for such expression through objects, viewing it as a symbolic performance (1996:29). 4. Russell W. Belk and his collaborators have shown that most personal collections begin with this same kind of seed object (1988:27-28). In one sense, we can see Restroom World as Carol's personal collec- tion, although it only exists because it is located in a community space and shared with that community. 5. The call-and-response is, of course, asynchronous. Its anonymous (pseudonymous) quality is dif- ferent from a face-to-face interaction; in a sense it is epistolary, although the messages are all very brief "one-liners." This too can be seen as a kind of indirect performance, since it is "witnessed" only after a time lag and behind the screen of anonymity. The nonverbal, indirect performance of Restroom World patrons echoes Carol's "silent" symbolic curatorial performance, described in note 3. 6. The dairyland idea is embraced by all constituencies-by the government, by commercial interests, and by citizens themselves. "America's Dairyland" is the motto that still graces Wisconsin license plates, despite constantly declining numbers of dairy farms and the reality that California and Texas lead the country in milk production. The red dairy barn graces much iconic material put out by the Division of Tourism. Dairyland symbols have also had commercial and popular success. Wisconsinites happily make fun of themselves by wearing "cheesehead" hats, and the items are sold as appropriate last-minute sou- venirs at local airports. The black and white "Holstein"(cow) pattern also adorns regionally identified artifacts ranging from souvenir T-shirts to tables in fast food restaurants. It is interesting that Joseph Kapler, who curated an exhibition entitled "Icon Wisconsin" at the Wisconsin Historical Museum (January 19, 2002-June 21, 2003) maintains that Wisconsinites embrace such icons to an unusually high degree and identify with the state in an especially vital way (personal conversation, May 8, 2002). Kapler worked closely with folklorist James P. Leary (University of Wisconsin-Madison) on this exhibit. 7. This kind of mute interaction is necessitated by the fact that patrons come to the bathroom at dif- ferent times during the day, but it is also tied to the element of surprise. Carol works on her displays when she is unlikely to run into others, and the "surprise!" quality of what she leaves there is part of the delight of the room. In turn, the guest book comments can also be "discovered" at any time (although one has to stop to look for them), and they reinforce the feeling that the room holds hidden treasure. These sur- prises are not about secretiveness; rather, they are gifts for others, offered in the spirit of a May basket left anonymously on a door handle, to be discovered in the morning by an unsuspecting but presumably delighted friend. Perhaps the mute offerings of this kind feel particularly appropriate in a backstage, pri- vate space. 8. Jack Santino (1994:160) tells a parallel story of a Bowling Green, Ohio, family that in 1987 had in- vested considerable creative energy in the construction of an elaborate witch figure for a Halloween dis- play. "Maleficent" was stolen a week before the holiday itself. The family was devastated, claiming that the theft not only "stole the magic" from the holiday, but the family's spirits as well. 9. I began to explore this conflation between people and spaces in an earlier article (Gordon 1996), and am expanding upon the importance of embodiment in the objects that women make and with which they interact in a forthcoming book (Gordon, unpublished manuscript). 10. Mikhail Bakhtin (1984:318) identified the grotesque body with a display of usually hidden, inte- rior features, such as blood, bowels, and other organs, and with the orifices that provide access to that</page><page sequence="20">Gordon, "Restroom World," a Backstage Women's Space 463 interior. The image of the grotesque body is dirty, licentious, and crude, he maintains, and it is associ- ated with food, drink, indecency, and laughter. 11. To return to Santino's story recounted in note 8, I find it significant that Maleficent was also a dressed, person-shaped (i.e., embodied) decoration; the fact that a "living" creature was stolen made the betrayal seem particularly strong. 12. Following Jones's schema of organizational types (1987:151, citing Barnard 1938), Restroom World works as an informal organization because of its internal structure and the interdependence of its par- ticipants. The downstairs bathroom failed because there was no such interdependence. 13. In her study of women's doll-making tradition in Rangely, Maine, Margaret R. Yocum (1993:147) concludes that women in particular value the period of childhood and the kind of play that teaches chil- dren to be nurturing. 14. Stoller insists we must rely equally on other means of taking in information in order to acquire the "substance of life-in-the-world" (1989:29). 15. Jane Przybysz (1993:177) also stated that visual pleasure is stereotypically associated with men, whereas tactile pleasure is associated with women. 16. This brings us back to Santino's idea (1994:25-7; 1996:159) that (interior) holiday decoration is usually considered to be woman's purview. It is a creative expression that aesthetically and sensually "satu- rates" the domestic environment. References Cited Ackerman, Diane. 1999. Deep Play. New York: Random House. Arieti, Silvano. 1976.
