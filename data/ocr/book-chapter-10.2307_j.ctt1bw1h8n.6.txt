He had become famous overnight, was  lionised in society, made a few radical speeches in  the House of Lords, and engaged in a series of love  affairs, not always by his own choice. The half-mad  Lady Caroline *Lamb, for example, fell in love with  him and pestered him almost to distraction. In 1815,  he married an heiress, Annabella Milbanke, but the  marriage was unhappy from the start. Conjectures  about his incestuous relationship with his half-sister  Augusta Leigh, combined with his wife’s complaints  of his dark moods of cruelty and despair, made  separation inevitable. (His daughter Ada became  Countess of *Lovelace.) Ostracised by many of his  former admirers, Byron left England for good in 1816  and moved to Switzerland, where he spent happy  weeks with the Shelleys. From a life of dissipation and  promiscuous love affairs in Venice (1817–19), Byron  was rescued by Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, a woman  of cultivated tastes who became his mistress. In this  Italian period he finished Childe Harold and among  other writings produced the drama Manfred (1817),  Beppo (1818) and A Vision of Judgement (1822). He  also began Don Juan (1819–24), that extraordinary  medley of satire, adventure and self-revelation which  remained unfinished at his death. Byron’s interest in  the cause of freeing Greece from Turkish rule led him  to join the liberation committee in 1823. He set out  for Greece later in the year; the following April he died  of fever at Missolonghi. For much of the 19th century  he was regarded as the epitome of the romantic hero,  a noble, melancholy wanderer and a passionate lover  of freedom, but this judgement, based on his early  poems, is largely the creation of his admirers (and in  some moods of himself ). The truer Byron, repressed  in youth and always aware of his deformity, was much  more of a satirist in the tradition of *Voltaire, an  ironical realist as little blind to his own failings as to  those of others, as aware of the savagery, squalor and  tedium of life as of its beauty and glory.
