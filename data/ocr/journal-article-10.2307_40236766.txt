<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extra -Ordinary Language Cyril Welch Any instance of language is called ordinary if it does not cali at- tention to thè background of meanings upon which it nonetheless rests. The communication of information, of feelings, of directives, présumes a background comprising such éléments as a communion of the persons involved, a community of interest defining a possible focus of attention, and a common medium of intercourse. There is ordinarily no need to bring this background into the forefront of considération, for we can easily enough articulate particular mean- ings while depending upon the wider context of articulation to supply its necessary support. And yet only that language can be called meaning/i// which recalls, by intent or by accident, thè back- ground otherwise dormant. Ordinary articulation does nothing to promote (let alone guarantee) its meaningfulness.1 Language is called extra-ordinary when it not only intentionally recalls the relevant background of meaning, but does so by con- verging that background upon the moment of speech. Four modes of discourse are generally assumed to be efficacious in promoting such recollective convergence: the interrogative, the imperative, the emotive, and the performative. For the force of a question can be more revealing than any fact. The urgency of an imperative can snap things into focus in a way seldom achieved by an observation of the way matters simply stand. Interrogative and imperative modes of discourse bring into focus the situation in which items of informa- tion can hâve their place. Similarly, the expression of feeling in speech can solidify commitments and responsibilities in a way that facts are powerless to do, and the steps actually taken in any language can be more decisive for the on-going course of affairs than any facts decided upon abstractly. Emotive and performative modes of discourse position us as speakers and listeners, readers and writers, in the context of otherwise indecisive information.2 Cyril Welch is Professor of Philosophy at Mount Allison University, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada. 159</page><page sequence="2">1 60 EXTRÀ-ORDINARY LANGUAGE Extra-ordinary language may employ familiär facts and may even say something unfamiliar about them. However, it recasts ail items of information, familiär or unfamiliar, into its own articulation and thus reconstitutes their significance by virtue of its own meaningful- ness. In other words, language qualifies as extra-ordinary only if its power to constitute a présence outstrips its informative power.3 If genuine communication is rare, it is not because information is abstruse or because people are obtuse. Communication of informa- tion breaks down when the sensé of communion, of community, and of shared medium fades, falters, or fails. Yet we cannot just turn to thèse background considérations without interrupting the flow of communication and thus aggravating the problem. There is something suffocating in any attempt to prepare the groundwork of communication with preliminary acts of charity ("let's be friends"), demands for security ("first tell me what you want"), and décisions about thè medium ("how do you define your terms?"). Background meanings hâve to develop, show themselves, and be affirmed in the thick of the discourse. Much of language displays the tensions of this task and so borders upon the extra-ordinary. In other words, much of our speaking and listening, reading and writing, is de- signed first of ail to constitute a présence and only secondarily to get information across. And hère we naturally proceed by way of interrogative, imperative, emotive, and performative modes of discourse. In polite conversation we find relief from the humdrum of the daily routine. We pick a topic of conversation with a view to transporting ourselves and even our particular labors into a fuller world of meaning. The topic will be some cross section of human expérience suggesting a concern for the totality of human effort: a problem in current politics or économies, a current issue of some sort, some conception of human destiny or purpose, an intriguing adventure revealing in an exaggerated way salient characteristics of the human enterprise such as prowess and chance. In such conversa- tion the facts matter very little as long as the participants succeed in making their concerns manifestly shared. This sharing occurs only if certain facts are taken as forming the topic of conversation. But the sharing requires also that the meaning of the facts appear and remain questionable. Only in this way is considération of them relevant. A recitation of sheer facts which identifies them with a certain meaning puts an end to conversation. By forming an articu- lation in the interrogative mode, each participant can take his own</page><page sequence="3">CYRIL WELCH 161 stand in and by respecting the stands of others. However, manifest disrespect for settled déterminations will remove the basis of common concern. The question is how to come to terms with the facts, and the participants must clearly discern the importance of their doing so. Polite conversation must be formed in part by the imperative mode of discourse. The emotive and performative modes contribute more or less weakly to the formation insofar as attach- ments are relevant and Channels of articulation are actually forged by the way the participants take their respective stands. But that the interweaving of thèse pre-informative modes of discourse is fragile in thè case of polite conversation is evident in the ease with which it slips into idle talk, a spurious refuge in the pre-established concerns of others. Obversely, conversation invites dialogue, a füll Statement of individuai responsibility in thè performance. The art of conversa- tion is largely one of preventing it from precipitating in either direction. The rhetorical Speeches of the law courts, assemblies, and profes- sional meetings are examples of discourse based on the art of dis- cerning and articulating shared meanings with a view to presenting a need and promoting an action. Unlike the art of conversation where things are allowed to corne up for the first time, that of orato- ry requires that one know beforehand what kind of people one is talking to, what spécifie meanings, dispositions, mannerisms of speech, préjudices, and desires prevaii in the group, and what it is speeifieally that one aims at getting done in concerted action. Hère questions are indeed raised but only in order to cali attention to answers already on hand; in this sense the interrogative mode of discourse is played down. For it is mainly a matter of embodying a sense of urgency and attachment suitable for positioning the par- ticipants to hold otherwise disparate déterminations together in a certain way. It is a matter of integrating the imperative and emotive modes of discourse to precipitate a realization of the performative. Again, information is hardly much to the point except insofar as the interest itself requires review of established and aeeepted déter- minations; one of the best ways of destroying an oration is to introduce information that is unfamiliar to the participants. Even in law courts, where the problem to all appearances is to get at the facts of certain expériences and législation, the task is really to add up the available items of information and frame them into a whole with a view to promoting an action; this task is aecomplished, lives are saved and lost, within and by modes of discourse which are "pre-</page><page sequence="4">1 62 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGUAGE informative." That is, the language hère and elsewhere coming into its own aspires to form and reveal thè context in which information can make sensé as a whole. Since apparent accuracy in the présenta- tion of facts can be measured only in référence to the context which interprets for us the measure of their relevancy, the language form- ing the context is prior to the informative mode of discourse ac- companying the présentation. To be sure, the orator proceeds as though the facts were to persuade the listener by their own weight, but his own success dépends upon whether he reveals thè imperative and emotive context making the facts appear to speak for them- selves. Although he need not aim to deceive, what he means (the context) is artfully distinct from (although not necessarily at vari- ance with) what he says (the facts), and his discourse is inherently open to the possibility of déception. We évidence our awareness of this possibility by our own propensity to go on to inspect the facts and to résume their discussion after they hâve been supposedly presented in füll clarity. The art of rhetoric is largely one of inspiring attachment and action while steering an even course between out- right déception (which is bound to backfire) and closer inspection (which is not to the point at the moment of rhetorical speech). The art of personal letter-writing is performative in the main; contacts are made or renewed, loyalties are formed and sympathies are expressed by the very instance of writing, and they are negated by the very lack of it. The art of thè ancient rhapsods and medieval troubadours, that of their modem counterparts, the populär singers, storytellers, and entertainers, is emotive in the main; attachments are evoked and solidified, and from there the world is momentarily remade in their image. The litanies surrounding the attachment to icons and the performance of rituals are imperative in the main. Litanies evoke familiär meanings and converge them upon the participants9 responsibility to, and momentary identity with, the surge of otherness in the fulfillment of a transcendent destiny. The urgency is not compounded out of the familiär facts, it rather recasts thèse facts in an image of its own. The whole art of impera- tive discourse hère is to reveal human response not as originating, but rather as originated by, the command. For the urgency only makes sensé in an act of acknowledgement. At one time this ac- knowledgement was préfigurée in the social and naturai setting, but it is nowadays disfigured by modem individualism. The füll im- perative force of litanies, icons, and rituals can only be historically recalled.</page><page sequence="5">CYRIL WELCH 163 The ordinary detective story is both sufficiently récent and suffi- ciently established to be conspicuous in the way it borders on extra-ordinary language. Facts are presented, distorted, interpreted, and eventually integrated toward a resolution of previously un- known quantities. The facts are accepted because they are articu- lated with a context which is of interest owing to its questionability. Suspense créâtes a relevance of facts which would in other contexts be called fictitious. The relevance rests upon the rôle of the reader: he feels himself questioned, and his own powers of détection are called into play. The discourse is mainly interrogative and per- fonnative. There is nothing really urgent about it for the reader; in fact he most likely finds in thè story relief from the ordinary grind of obligations. Similarly, thè attachments are ever so slight, being formed by a curiosity seeking to concern oneself about problems distinctively not one's own. The main thing is the performance: the rigorous even if casual exercise of perception, the actual process of keeping a manifold of disparate information together in one piece. The reader cornes out for what he is in becoming sensitive to the things that are. Short-lived as it is, the expérience is extra- ordinary. What makes such familiär modes of discourse as polite conversa- tion, artful oratory, and thè detective story merely borderline cases of extra-ordinary language is that they are designed to do away with themselves at the moment of their termination. Something might be retained from such discourse, but whatever it is, it will take another form. Conversation can adumbrate dialogue and so open up possibilities of continuation. Oratory can adumbrate méditation; a story of détection can adumbrate the meaning of rational perception. But thèse adumbrations are not designed to be final and are not intentionally promoted in themselves. This it is that extra-ordinary language does, and it does it not by simply employing interrogative, imperative, emotive, and performative modes of discourse, but by transforming thèse modes into a solid, articulated basis. The füll force of a question is not yet experienced as long as someone simply asks it. The situation of articulation has to be the source of the question and provide its force. Similarly with commands, émotions, and actions: as long as they appear to ema- nate from particular individuals in a situation, we cannot expérience them as our own or as having any force in themselves. Paradoxically, they are our own only when their source is the situation itself : when they are participated rather than concocted. It is easy enough to</page><page sequence="6">1 64 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGUAGE issue a command, to hâve a feeling, to do something or other, but to expérience the command as issuing from the situation, the attachment as belonging to the situation, the action as integrating the éléments of the situation, is not so easy. It requires an art in itself, namely that of transforming thèse modes of discourse to achieve a basis in an articulated situation, a basis allowing us to participate fully and abidingly in the situation. I Dramatic tragedy provides the most powerful exemplification of extra-ordinary language. A context of human effort and endeavor is outlined by the manner in which a modicum of information is presented. The piece does not so much tell us about the context it is presenting as it allows us to gather it up in the course of the présen- tation. As any instance of extra-ordinary discourse, the dramatic tragedy turns toward itself, focuses in upon itself, and only thereby draws others into its sphère of meaning. For this reason the in- formation that we gather from thè piece is not deceptive : it does not claim to make the context what it is, as would be the case if we were told the facts outright; rather, the presented context makes the information what it is, makes it meaningful and relevant. The information presented in tragedy serves to raise a question in the hero's mind. The formation of the context must itself give rise to his question, and if it succeeds in doing so it makes the question hover over everybody involved, on stage and off, participants assigned a rôle in thè piece itself and participants assuming a place in the viewing or reading of it. By participating in the questionable situation, we are able to participate in its development. The situa- tion has to develop, since the aspirations integral to the presented and formed context make it imperative that the hero attend to and résolve certain difficulties. His station demands it. The force of the question is portrayed in a tragedy to coincide with the force of the command. Moreover, the hero is portrayed as a man powerfully attached to certain éléments in the context and as one whose rôle in the on-going processes is also one of power: he acts with power and so suffers with power, or he suffers with power and so acts with power. Ali of the features of a tragedy - the modicum of information, the question, the need, the attachments, the actions - are linguisti-</page><page sequence="7">CYRIL WELCH 165 cally formed, yet without our being told about them. The formation is held together by its sensé of pending development. The plot is presented in a séquence designed to interweave the Strands of recognizable information and the force of the pre-informative modes of discourse into a knot which cannot be directly resolved, but only acknowledged and resolved in a way compatible with the acknowl- edgement. Since the station of the hero makes it peculiarly his job to ask the questions, issue the commands, love and hâte whom he chooses, do what he can and likes, he resists this acknowledgement and proceeds to try to untie the knot as though he were in complete charge. His station rightly appears as one giving being to his situa- tion rather than as one dictating that he respond to the way things are already. Accordingly, a deadly silence reigns over this develop- ment. Because everything that is said and left unsaid borrows its meaning from, and then also converges upon, this silence, the viewer or reader is brought to participate in what he might other- wise dismiss out of hand or view only curiously as somebody else's entanglement. So, participating in the knot, ail are able to participate in the development, the acknowledgement, and the resolution. We witness Oedipus preening himself for the task of finding the man who we know will be himself. We witness Hamlet shying away from the task which we know is going to be his. We witness Clyde Griffiths writhing within the sphère of his attachments which we know he will hâve to live out and live up to. The power of the tragic hero begins to manifest itself as he takes upon himself, at first no doubt reluctantly but then more and more resolutely, the question which was at first only gratuitously posed by him. The articulation of the plot makes it more and more imperative that a resolution be reached, and the hero learns gradually to accept his own rôle in the resolution as inévitable for him rather than in- cidental to his discrétion. Attachments meanwhile develop a keen edge and action becomes imminent. The crucial moment, to which the articulation as a whole is building up, is the moment when the force of the question, the command, the émotion, and the per- formance gets reversed: when ail thèse forces devolve upon the station of the hero - the hero himself- rather than simply derive from it. The tragic movement is that of acknowledging thèse forces as emanating not from thè hero's prerogative, but from his respon- sibility. The effect of the acknowledgement upon the participants occurs by virtue of a convergence of ail hitherto portrayed, said, and unsaid</page><page sequence="8">1 66 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGUAGE meanings, upon the moment. A moment is created and experienced where the participants step forth for what they are and confront the things of their world for what they are. Because the initial forms of the pre-informative modes of discourse are transformed to devolve upon ail, rather than issuing from one or a few, the moment belongs to ail. The brunt of the transformation is assumed by the tragic hero himself, not so much in doing something within the portrayed situation as in doing something about it. He préserves it, he up- holds its meaning, as his responsibility from beginning to end; he does the superhuman: he affirms his world and holds it together in his affirmation. This performance is carried through linguistically, as a matter of articulating the situation in which ail are by now involved. It thereby sets the standard of affirmative discourse: the integration of modes of pre-informative discourse allowing one to corne to terms with particular facts of circumstance, rather than with thè abstract proposai of an arbitrarily chosen fact. II Comedy is not unlike tragedy insofar as the central figure is called upon to corne to terms with indifferent or initially hostile circum- stances. What is decisive about any of the many kinds of comedy is the performance of the man in the face of his circumstances. How- ever, the plot of the comedy is necessarily thin, of human interest at most. There can be no criticai development, no decisive moment of absolute convergence of meanings upon a distraught responsibil- ity. A tragedy often incorporâtes spans of comedy, particularly low comedy, because it pro vides a relief from tension while maintaining the primacy of human affirmation. For while what is portrayed as happening in a comedy initially appears as simply absurd, the figures in a comedy reveal themselves and their situations for what they are by continuing nonetheless to face, articulate, and so sustain the situation in the onslaught of otherwise gratuitous circumstances. The act of sustaining the situation is not itself said, it is articulated in the performative mode: comedy sets the standard of affirmative discourse as a matter of sustaining the situation as a whole rather than one of maintaining a point within or about it. ΠΙ Verse, accentuated perhaps by rhyme or rhythm or both, serves to</page><page sequence="9">CYRIL WELCH 167 set relations of meanings apart and to allow them to be integrateci at the moment by the participants. Recognized verbal meanings are thereby reorganized to form an extra-ordinary meaning. The mean- ing experienced is extra-ordinary not because it is new or différent - although it may indeed appear so since it appears in its particular form for the first time. It is extra-ordinary because it exacts partici- pation from those hearing or reading it: the verses make sensé, but only insofar as the participants come forth explicitly to re-articulate the familiär but somehow dissonant meanings, making them con- sonant, making them meaningful altogether. The participation is exacted by the partial familiarity of the meanings; but it cannot be coerced, for then attention would be called to the participation as a fact itself and so away from actual participation on the part of the participants. What cornes out, then, is the participant for what he is. What he is, though, is just his mode of concentration, and what verse does is to focus this concentration upon the éléments initially presented: it reveals things in the thatness of their being. Since it directly calls upon the reader's powers of articulation, verse particularly exemplifies the performative mode of discourse. It fits in well enough with tragédies and comédies, but of course it can also stand alone, as it does in poetry. In the formation of poems, thè interrogative and imperative modes of discourse are subdued, and the challenge of performance is to form an articulation without the aid of thèse two modes. Nonsense verse and many nursery rhymes manage to subdue even thè emotive mode of dis- course and so présent a nearly pure case of performative discourse. However, the performance of verse achieves a broader foothold in thè emotive mode of discourse, namely by incorporating familiär sentiments into a whole which then becomes a formed context of attachment. The formation of sentiment in verse is challenging because it requires a conversion of the initial sentiments evoked if it is to achieve the level of poetry and not come down to a réitération of the familiär and humdrum. The verse must detach us from the familiär sentiments, initially and partially portrayed, in order to attach us to its own context of meanings as they themselves form a whole: otherwise we fall back on our own fragmented sentiments. Poems which are mainly sentimental in purport do not actually make the conversion, but only adumbrate it. In this respect they differ most obviously from tragédies and comédies. However, any case of verse, just by dint of its linguistic formation, converges meanings upon a center of silence inviting an affirmation of the</page><page sequence="10">1 68 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGUAGE context présentée for attachaient and performance. It argues for a standard of affirmative discourse contextually ratber than factually oriented. IV Narrative is the rétrospective telling of a story having a beginning, middle, and end. The telling can occur in verse, as in epic poetry, or in prose form, as in the modem novel. Narrative is itself an art and so distinguishable from backyard or newspaper accounts of récent events. Genuine narrative exacts a performative participation and becomes a taie of my own expérience, while the other only entices a curiosity in the lives and deaths of others and becomes a vicarious distraction from my own. The ordinary language of pas- time and newspapers may spare no pains to be strictly informative, and the effect is that we cannot fully share its meaning. Accounts of naturai and politicai phenomena can, of course, supply information which can be incorporated into the field of interest and effort we bring with us, but neither in this case is it the intent of the language to create a concrete expérience. By contrast, it is evident that gen- uine narrative does just this: starting out with thè pretense of telling a story about other people, perhaps in far away places and long past times, it constructs an arena of expérience which gradually absorbs the reader or listener to make him a part of its own meaning. The effect of narrative is largely achieved through the making of a narrator. In ancient epic poetry the narrator created by the lan- guage of présentation is the nation; the reader or listener reads or listens by becoming a part of the nation and thereby participating in the ups and downs, values and préjudices of the time. The native's expérience of the epic narration is a groundwork of communica- tion: communion with his fellowman, community of interest, the common land of toil. The events are nonetheless witnessed as settled, for they are recounted as having already happened. In one sensé the outcome is then experienced ail along as predetermined. The resuit is that participation cannot mean identification with the unfolding of the facts depicted. To participate means to confiront this unfolding by acknowledging the forces of communion, com- munity, and the common land at the moment. In the modem novel, on the other hand, an author must select among a number of possible stances for the narrator he créâtes:</page><page sequence="11">CYRIL WELCH 169 first or third, occasionally even second person; omniscient, partial, or impartial in its swoop. Each has its own peculiar effect and its own difficulty to overcome. For the participant, hère generally the reader, gravitâtes toward the stance of the narrator and initially expériences the field of portrayed meanings as he identifies with that stance - although the narrator may eventually force the reader to assume his own stance as an individuai judging the circumstances for himself. Difficulties arise in the création of this interplay of stances because, to be effective, it has to be consonant with the portrayed meanings. For instance, if the novel is portraying the forces of expérience as they utterly subject the involved human beings to their caprice, it will be difficult to introduce an omniscient narrator without implying a possible mastery for those human beings. To participate in the articulation of a modem novel means to stand somehow apart to judge and rejudge the people and the events portrayed, just as those portrayed judge one another and what happens to them. The art of narration, however it proceeds, has the task of making the invitation to participation at once both clear and tacit. It must remain tacit, since any explicit remark constitutes just one more item which has to be accounted for and which might deserve to be put down as misleading. For instance, the particular stance from which the taie is told cannot itself be told, but must rather be disclosed in thetelling:whateverissaidaboutthe narrator in a modem novel - directly, as when the first person comments on his own behalf, or indirectly, as when the third person account is patently laden with interprétations and opinions - simply invites the reader into a dia- logue where he has to account for the meaning of the narrative stance as well as that of the narration. The invitation itself can nonetheless be made clear, namely by thè development of pre- informative modes of discourse. Réticence is hardly a way of not saying things; it is a way of designing what is being said. An ar- rangement of facts constituting a situation might be conspicuously riddled with lacunae or spotted with human concerne and aspira- tions yet to be fulfilled or defeated. The question appears initially as one asking how human interests are going to fare in the setting. The question then develops as to whether and why the interest should take the form it does. In this development the endeavor depicted in the taie as a whole takes an imperative turn and devolves upon ail the éléments otherwise innocently portrayed - and so upon the reader as well, who started out innocently wonder-</page><page sequence="12">170 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGUAGE ing how things were for others and how they would turn out. Some mode of attachment evolves in response to the portrayed situation as a whole, an attachment which may take a variety of forms, for instance that of a morbid but attractive révulsion or that of a tender sympathy. If we are able to continue through the narration as we would through one in a daily newspaper, the expérience fails and probably aborts before the narration is finished: for we are left with factual items of curiosity to which we might be flittingly at- tached but which form no sustaining context of attachment. A genuine narrative engulfs us momentarily and leads us to take the questions, commands, and émotions as involving us in the por- trayed context; which is not to say we take thèse to ourselves as our very own. And since the events are narrated as having already run their course, being presently only recounted, the expérience of narrative leads us to the inévitable, to the expérience of fate: the sensé that things could not be otherwise and that the question is not how to change them but how to corne to terms with them. The expérience of fate concretely configured in a narrative is therefore performative in the füllest sensé. We articulate the narrative by holding its éléments together as a whole and by coming to terms with things as they are. The réticence of a narration is our own - in the form of our own performance. V Myth has the distinctive feature of claiming to account for the origin of the human situation. The account may proceed on the basis of the conflict of human, superhuman, or anthropomorphic forces, as in the case of many ancient myths, or it may confine itself first of all to nonhuman éléments, the remnants or intimations of which are presently experienced in the human situation, as in the case of most modern myths. The origin recalled in the telling of the myth may hâve référence mainly to what was, or it may refer more directly to what is to corne, but in either case the myth claims to account for what was to be, to established destiny, and so has a cyclical if not omnitemporal purport. The peculiarity of speaking about origins is that we cannot inform others about them; neither can others inform us about them. For our relationship to our own origin cannot be one of integrating information into our pre-established designs. The telling and hear-</page><page sequence="13">CYRIL WELCH 171 ing of a myth proceeds in other forms of discourse. First of ail, the mention of an origin calls things, ourselves, and our relation to things into question and exacts a reassessment of the way matters stand for us. We are asked on the face of it to account for the whole of what we expérience, but more fundamentally to acknowledge an origin accounting for us. The account is directed not so much to the origin itself - for what could be said about what gives rise to there being things to say? - as to the things originated. We are not even told what things are like : we are told that they are, and not by virtue of themselves, but by virtue of a dérivation. We are in effect told to take, value, and understand things in their derived, and that means for us contingent and precarious, thatness. Our hold on them is thereby momentarily modifiée from the mode of merely taking them and ourselves for granted in the ordinary course of events, to the mode of taking them in their being, as being. The expérience of myth as it unfolds in pre-informative discourse is only apparently that of an account of how things were or are to be. It is an expéri- ence of their présence. The origin of things, ourselves, and our relation to them is nothing but their présence as they occasionally obtrude upon what is otherwise imminent oblivion. Augustine of Hippo interprets Genesis to be presenting a prés- ence of things such that mortai man can read his own temporal and historical destiny into the process of the dérivation, only to become transparent to the ever-present création and thè eternai creator sustaining him throughout the illusions of time and history. Populär modem accounts of the origin of the cosmos precipitate and confirm the modem interprétation of the way things abidingly are for finite man: needing to struggle to survive among essentially unstable and so hostile forces, accepting a material origin and a material destiny, taking things and oneself as self-made moments in a process of dérivation. Both the ancient and the modem myths provide articula- tions of things which, insofar as we undertake them, bring us face to face with things as a whole and in the thatness of their being. The salient technique of mythic discourse is the use of symbols. The events apparently portrayed in the mode of informative lan- guage shape a pattern of articulation which at once stands on its own as an account and yet recalls also parallel pattems in the daily thought and actions of the participants. The decisive moment of mythic discourse is thè one where two basic dimensions of meaning become manifest simultaneously: that of the circumstances ex- perienced in the situation portrayed and that eliciting the human</page><page sequence="14">1 72 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGU AGE rôle in that situation. Each juncture of the articulation therefore has multiple meanings by its very nature and can withstand as many spécifie interprétations as there are participants. The thrust of a mythic symbol is one bringing each man's vocation into the prés- ence of things so that it can give rise to a variety of spécifie corréla- tions between what is said within the articulation and what can be said about current patterns of thought and activity. The basic thrust is then that of a réticence in which ail meanings converge on the moment of participation, both ail those portrayed in the account and ail those peculiar to the participants own vocation. A man's rôle in this participation is that of performative acknowledgement of his own dérivation and concomitantly of the derived présence of things. VI Reflection requires a mode of articulation, the language of which turns back directly upon itself as well as turning the participants toward the things that are. Argument is thè basic means by which we bring meanings to light in reflection. We frame what we hâve to say - and also what we hear - in a model where each moment of meaning is to find its proper place in relation to the others; for instance, we distinguish between premises and conclusions and point out the principles of their connection. Thus a reflective articulation becomes meaningful in the performative mode of discourse : over and above the meanings of the propositions and définitions being considered, some being assented to and others being tested, the overall meaning cornes out only in and through the action of holding the various points to- gether in the chosen model. It is also interrogative and imperative in the füllest sensé, since by claiming to state a basic meaning of the human situation one is at once suspending the apparent claims internai to the situation and demanding reassessment of them. The emotive character of reflective discourse is initially subdued, since one is detaching oneself from the particular ordinary meanings called into question and commanding attention. However, the detachment is but a prelude of a modifiée attachment. Since the aim of argument is to gather things together and promote an attachment to the totality of things, the language of reflection is in the end the most powerfully emotive of ail.</page><page sequence="15">CYRIL WELCH 173 Dialectic proceeds by way of countering argument with argument and breaking thè encystment in any finite model, thereby calling particular attention to the questionable and exacting character of the performance. Opposing views are presented to entice the partici- pants - readers or listeners - to question the particular views which they happen to hâve entertained hitherto and to command a new or at least enlarged view of their own. Particular attachments are violated to the end of forming a new attachment, namely, one embracing the gathering together of various otherwise ignored meanings. Since the initial aim of reflective discourse is to cali the partici- pants' power of articulation into play, the most elementary tech- nique is enthymeme. By leaving moments of the argument unspoken in the heat of a discussion, one paves the way to an acknowledge- ment of one's own rôle in the development of meaning. The ensuing double-take reveals the necessity of an inside, performative view of the context of meaning brought under review for spectators initially innocent of its meaning. The point of enthymeme is to introduce a commitment to acceptance of one's own performative rôle; it promotes a transition from an oblivious presumption to a circumspect assumption of basic meanings. In this way the issue of the argument is seen as holding something out for the participants rather than simply being foisted off upon them by means of verbal contrivances. The danger of reflective discourse, whether monologue, dialogue, or enthymeme, is that when ail is said and done reality is iden- tified with constructs. This identification is, up to this point, in- évitable in that the initial and apparent goal of argument is to secure the issue within the construct and to ensure the participants of the cogency of the argument with regard to the issue. However, the meaning of such discourse occurs not at the moment of identity, but at the moment where reality - the thatness as well as the what- ness of things - enters into the constructs. Thus thè ultimate art of reflective discourse is to design and conduct a responsible réticence which lets reality speak for itself. This art is then basically that of aphorism. A simple Statement is so designed that it makes ail familiär meanings questionable, exacts their reconstitution, at- taches the participants to the unspoken entirety of meanings, and by its adumbration of an array of untold meanings requires an ever-renewed performance of momentary concrétion. An aphorism calls attention not so much to spécifie meanings as to a convergence</page><page sequence="16">174 EXTRA-ORDINARY LANGUAGE of untold meanings. In the silence of this convergence is called to the fore the place of beings, oneself, and what one confronts, rather than just something about them. If the language of reflection is informative as well, it is so in an unforseeable multiplicity of ways. As any instance of extra-ordinary language, it forms the context in which sharing is possible. NOTES 1 For a detailed discussion of the relationship between the manifestée mean- ings of language (instanced by words, propositions, and arguments) and the sustaining background of meaning (communion, community, medium), see the author's "Language as a Standard" in Man and World, Volume 3, Number 3. 2 For a fuller discussion of thè power of the four modes of pre-informative discourse in the préservation of meaningful language, see the author's "Speak- ing and Bespeaking" in New Essays in Phenomenology (Chicago, Quadrangle Books, 1969). 8 See Sesonske, "Saying, Being and Freedom of Speech" in Philosophy and Khetoric, Volume 1, Number 1; also Campbell, ibid., Volume 2, Number 4. These authors emphasize the manner in which human beings manifest themselves as what and who they are. John M. Anderson, in his Realm ofArt, as well as Heidegger in his numerous essays on art, poetry, and language, in effect shows the constitutive power of (extra-ordinary) language directed not just to the human personality, but to the human world and to the things man confronts in his world. The présent study owes much to their efforts.</page></plain_text>
