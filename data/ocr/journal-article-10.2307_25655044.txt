<plain_text><page sequence="1">GAMES IN 'THE GARDEN OF DECEIT': A SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY NOVELLA BY MARIA DE ZAYAS Y SOTOMAYOR Maria de Zayas y Sotomayor's prose collection of Novelas amorosas y ejem plares was first published in 1637. Containing ten tales and a narrative frame of clear Decameron provenance, this prose work and its sequel, the Desenganos amorosos (1647), had remarkable success from Zayas's lifetime onwards, being steadily republished until the early nineteenth century and also circulating in translation.1 'El jardin enganoso' is the final novella of the Novelas amorosas y ejemplares; the tale is encapsulated in its title, 'The Garden of Deceit', which refers to its key episode and pivotal setting. Firstly, I shall examine the recur rence of deception in this novella, linking the motif with the tale's depiction of gender relations. I shall then set the story in its literary and legendary context, studying Zayas's intertextual games. Lastly, I shall link events from 'El jardin enganoso' to its encompassing frame narrative, investigating the wider significance of the author's intratextual game. Deciphering patterns of deceit is integral to the interpretation of'El jardin enganoso'. The tale is narrated by Laura, hostess of the storytelling gathering and mother of the sickly Lisis, for whom the sarao has been convened. The story hinges upon the vicissitudes of two sisters, described as 'dos hermosisi mos soles', Constanza and Teodosia.2 Initially, Laura eulogizes the sisters as having equal charms: 'tan iguales en belleza, discretion y donaire que no desdecia nada la una de la otra' (p. 515). Complications arise because of their asymmetrical relationship with two brothers, Jorge and Federico. While Jorge's love for Constanza is requited and appears likely to result in marriage, Federico's infatuation with Teodosia goes unreciprocated. Teodosia sets the chain of deception in motion, so coveting Jorge's love 'que empezo a trazar y buscar modos de apartarle de la voluntad de su hermana, envidiosa de verla amada, haciendo esto tan astuta y recatada que jamas le dio a entender ni al uno ni al otro su amor' (p. 516). Her plotting is all the more devious for being largely undetected. The narrator thus shifts from praise of the two sisters to their differentiation by the crucial trait of virtue, which is not included in their first description as exemplars of beauty, discretion, and wit. Henceforth, it is evident that Teodosia and, later, Jorge become the primary deceivers in 1 See Margaret Rich Greer, Maria de Zayas Tells Baroque Tales of Love and the Cruelty of Men (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000), especially Chapter 2, for an excellent overview of the texts' reception. 2 Maria de Zayas y Sotomayor, Novelas amorosas y ejemplares, ed. by Julian Olivares (Madrid: Catedra, 2000), p. 515.

Constanza is the victim or 'pawn' of their manipulative games, and gender is a crucial factor in her victimization. Teodosia makes the first move in the game to win Jorge by making use of Constanza's friendship with Federico. Naive as to the grave consequences that her lies can and will produce, she informs Jorge that Constanza and Federico are secretly planning to marry. The narrator claims that Teodosia intends to usurp her sister's position as Jorge's beloved without causing further harm: 'Engano comun en todos los que hacen mai, pues sin mirar que le procuran al aborrecido, se le dan juntamente al amado' (p. 517). Teodosia here treacherously uses the honour code in an enredo' to further her own desires (p. 518). Jorge's wrath is such that he stabs his brother to death and flees to Naples, where he will remain for four years.3 Teodosia's perfidious act therefore unintentionally results in fratricide, and Jorge's sudden departure thwarts both sisters' aspirations for imminent marriage. Still longing for the absent Jorge, Teodosia encourages her sister to marry, and Carlos, a poor nobleman, wins Constanza's hand.4 When Jorge returns, he resumes his pursuit of Constanza despite her happily married state. Discovering the depth of Teodosia's love for Jorge, Constanza urges him to marry her sister, a tactic that mixes altruism with self-preservation. When Constanza's entreaties fail, she sets him a seemingly impossible challenge: Hagamos, senor don Jorge, un concierto; y sea que como vos me hagais en esta placeta que esta delante de mi casa, de aqui a la manana, un jardin tan adornado de cuadros y olorosas flores, arboles y fuentes, que ni en su frescura ni belleza, ni en la diversidad de pajaros que en el haya, desdiga de los nombrados pensiles de Babilonia que Semiramis hizo sobre sus muros, yo me pondre en vuestro poder y hare por vos cuanto deseais. (p. 527)5 3 Jorge's murder of Federico echoes the archetypal story of fratricide: that of Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam and Eve (Genesis 4. 1-16). The covert rivalry between two sisters?Teodosia and Constanza?is developed by Zayas in greater depth. 4 Carlos is another character to engage in trickery; through devious means, he wins Constanza in marriage despite his meagre fortune. However, the match ultimately brings Constanza happiness, so that his duplicity is not comparable to that of Teodosia or Jorge. 5 Here, Constanza attributes the Babylonian gardens to the legendary Semiramis. Similarly, Calderon linked Semiramis to the gardens in La hija del aire (c. 1650); in the play's segunda parte Semiramis cites among her triumphs Babilonia, esa ciudad que desde el primer cimiento fabrique, lo diga; hablen sus muros, de quien pendiendo jardines estan, a quien llaman pensiles por eso. (i- 359) Gwynne Edwards has surveyed the Semiramis legend's development and dramatization through the ages: see Pedro Calderon de la Barca, La hija del aire, ed. and intro. by Gwynne Edwards (London: Tamesis, 1970).</page><page sequence="3">1010 'The Garden of Deceit' of Maria de Zayas If he can create a beautiful garden by morning, she will yield to his will; otherwise, he must marry Teodosia. This leads to the creation of the epony mous 'Garden of Deceit', the final and most elaborate act of engano of Zayas's novella. Jorge goes to an isolated spot, where he despairs of his predicament in 'tristes y lastimosos suspiros' (p. 527). The Devil overhears Jorge and offers a solution to his predicament: 'Pues mandame el alma y hazme una cedula firmada de tu mano de que sera mia cuando se aparte del cuerpo, y vuelvete seguro que antes que amanezca podras cumplir a tu dama su imposible deseo' (p. 528). This would not have seemed incredible, given the prevailing theological beliefs of Zayas's audience, which considered the Devil to be capable of altering la apariencia exterior de las cosas, no su autentica sustancia'.6 Constanza's ill advised oath results in Jorge's exchange of his soul for the garden. He enters into the diabolical pact, despite the detrimental consequences that this will also entail for Constanza's honour. The garden is intended as an indirect means to seduce the steadfastly virtuous woman, Constanza. Moreover, it functions as the turning-point of the narrative and as a catalyst for its denouement. Constanza faints on viewing the false garden, an ominous and beautiful sight, 'tan adornado de flores y arboles, que aun le parecio que era menos lo que habia pedido, segiin lo que le daban, pues las fuentes y hermosos cenadores ponian espanto a quien los veia' (pp. 529-30). She tearfully reveals the significance of the garden to her husband, beseeching him to kill her in order to free her from her dishonourable promise. Jorge and Carlos then indulge in a series of altruistic acts, each attempting to outdo the other. This culminates with the reappearance of the Devil; with unexpected magnanimity, he returns Jorge's 'cedula': No me habeis de veneer, aunque mas hagais, pues donde un marido, atropellando su gusto y queriendo perder la vida, se vence a si mismo, dando licencia a su mujer para que cumpla lo que prometio; y un loco amante, obligado de esto, suelta la palabra que le cuesta no menos que el alma, como en esta cedula se ve que me hace donation de ella, no he de hacer menos yo que ellos. Y asi, para que el mundo se admire de que en mi pudo haber virtud, toma don Jorge. Ves ahf tu cedula; yo te suelto la obligation, que no quiero alma de quien tan bien se sabe veneer, (p. 532) The Devil and garden vanish, leaving only 'un espeso y hediondo humo' in their wake (p. 532), and both Constanza and Jorge are released from their respective pacts.7 Constanza is favoured more by luck than by her virtuous course of action, which undermines the tale as an exemplary lesson. Jorge 6 Nicanor Gomez-Villegas, Tmplicaciones teologicas de "el pacto con el demonio" en la tradition literaria aurea', Hipertexto, 4 (2006), 75-98 (p. 78). 7 The legal connotations of Jorge's transaction with the Devil are evident; the binding documen tation or 'cedula' must be nullified in order to release him from his oath. The binding contract, often signed in blood, is, as I shall make clear, a typical feature of the works involving pacts</page><page sequence="4">EAVAN O'BRIEN 1011 remorsefully requests of Constanza 'lo que tii ayer me dabas, deseosa de mi bien, y yo como loco desprecie, que es la hermosa Teodosia como mujer' (p? 533)&gt; and all protagonists celebrate the marriage. Teodosia has achieved the prize that she immorally sought and for which she willingly tarnished her sister's reputation: marriage to Jorge. Teodosia is the 'maker' throughout Zayas's text; her ability to affect the fates of others is second only to that of the Devil.8 Ironically, her undeserved good fortune is the cause of rejoicing among those whom she endangered and manipulated. Constanza's personal joy is understandable, given that Jorge and Teodosia's marriage potentially marks an end to her strife. Edward H. Friedman describes the marriage as a travesty of the sacrament of matrimony and of the didactic function of literature'.9 However, predictable exemplarity is not Zayas's pri mary concern: as Marina S. Brownlee puts it, 'her interest lies in the power of words to deceive and in deceivers who triumph'.10 It seems probable that this happy resolution is intended to induce the reader to further thought. Brownlee notes that, in Zayas's carefully crafted texts, the interpretative ambiguities al low the discerning reader to savour 'the Baroque openendedness of the text'.11 Morally, the only trace of justice is that Teodosia wins a murderer as a hus band, in a match that has been facilitated by the Devil. Friedman classifies this novella as 'deceptively idealistic' because of the overall sense of injustice.12 By dint of its position as the final novella of the Novelas amorosas y ejemplaresy the evident lack of justice heralds a thematic shift in Zayas's following prose collection; such injustice is more in keeping with outcomes in the Desenganos amorosos. Teodosia's treachery towards her sister and its consequences?the murder of the innocent Federico?are unknown until she chooses to reveal them. It seems that Constanza never hears her sister repent, and it is certain that Jorge does not: Despues de muerto don Jorge, Teodosia conto el caso como quien tan bien lo sabia. with the Devil. Constanza's mistake, in another transaction, is to barter foolishly with her marital fidelity. 8 I borrow this term from Diana de Armas Wilson, who applies it to Camila in her article '"Passing the love of women": The Intertextuality of El curioso impertinente, Cervantes, 7 (1987), 9-28 (p. 27). 9 Edward H.

(p. 534) Even Teodosia's written account of events does not seem to be confessional in nature. She prepares an intratextual game for the reader: to select the most virtuous character in the story, the reader's options being curtailed to a choice between Carlos, Jorge, and the Devil. The frame protagonists thus misguidedly cede primacy to male roles; as a result, in H. Patsy Boyer's words, 'these kinds of distortion lead the reader to rethink the story from a gender perspective'.13 An ironic detail is Teodosia's omission of Constanza from the contest; she is the only person to show virtue consistently throughout.14 The frame characters, in their response to Laura's novella, unwittingly suc cumb to Teodosia's game, and Juan wins the competition by dint of his de fence of the Devil. This debate illustrates the dialogical scenario that Zayas creates, whereby sarao participants express their opinions of each successive tale. Zayas's readers are as much writing as reading meaning, a process that is modelled by the inscribed listeners' divergent reactions to the stories that they hear. The reader is denied a facile interpretation and is awakened from passivity to active involvement with the text; in Roland Barthes's language, Zayas makes the reader a producer rather than a consumer of her 'writerly' text.15 Before recounting the tale, Laura explained her aim: el decirla yo no es mas de para dar ejemplo y prevenir que se guarden de las ocasiones' (p. 5!3) Moral goals, such as Laura's explicit statement of the novella's exemplarity, would have achieved the official approval of literary censors. None the less, her audience completely misreads the story: they fail to identify Constanza as the source of virtue and good example. Furthermore, the tale is not received as a warning, since immoral protagonists are rewarded and praised (Teodosia, Jorge, and even the Devil), while the virtuous Constanza remains blissfully ig norant of her sister's treachery. Laura, in another natural image, later contends in the Desenganos amorosos that como dijo el rey don Alonso el Sabio, que el corazon del hombre es bosque de espesura, que nadie le puede hallar senda, donde la crueldad, bestia fiera y indomable, tiene su morada y habitation'.16 However, a close reading of the novella illustrates that a hidden jardin enganoso 13 H.

Whitenack (London: Associated University Presses, 1995), pp. 52-71 (p. 60). 14 Zayas probably chose to name her 'Constanza in order to reinforce her 'constant' virtue. The reader promptly realizes that Constanza is not 'constant' in her love for Jorge?she marries Carlos and is a devoted wife to him. She is indeed 'constant' in a sphere that is more all-encompassing than loyalty to a suitor: that is, her exemplary virtue. 15 Roland Barthes, S/Z, trans, by Richard Miller, ed. by Richard Howard (London: Cape, 1974). 16 Maria de Zayas y Sotomayor, Desenganos amorosos, ed. by Alicia Yllera (Madrid: Catedra, 1998), p. 288.

It appears that Zayas is more interested in Teodosia's perfidious behaviour towards Constanza than in the latter's virtuous exemplarity. By focusing upon Teodosia's deceit and culpability in Laura's tale, we can see, through the inadequate discussion in the frame narrative, that the sister's wrongdoings persist not only to the end of the story but beyond. None the less, from the relatively happy outcome of 'El jardin enganoso' we detect that there may be a 'hidden meaning within the text', which Carmen R. Rabell uncovers as often being implied by the ironic discrepancy between Spanish novellas' contents and the didactic goals of their prologues and frames.17 I shall return to the possibility of a 'hidden meaning' behind Laura's tale in the final section of this paper. Zayas's novellas are not only framed by the marco narrativo but also by other texts, and 'El jardin enganoso' contains a criss-crossing of literary and legendary influences. Intertextuality of course reminds us that, as a text, the novella exists in relation to others. As Michel Foucault declared: The frontiers of a book are never clear-cut: beyond the title, the first lines and the last full stop, beyond its internal configuration and its autonomous form, it is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences: it is a node within a network.18 The very wording of Constanza's challenge brings us into contact with a world beyond Zayas's text: namely, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.19 Margaret Rich Greer suggests that 'El jardin enganoso' develops into 'an implicit reversal of the biblical story of the fall of humanity into original sin and death', which had the Garden of Eden as its setting (Genesis 2-3).20 It is certainly the case that, in Zayas's novella, the wondrous garden or earthly paradise is made by the Devil, instead of being God's creation. None the less, similar to the Babylonian gardens, I consider it to be better envisioned as a spectacular, albeit artificial, re-creation of the Garden of Eden rather than its inverse. Henceforth, the appearance of Zayas's garden unexpectedly leads to its inhabitants' redemption from sinful desire, avoiding catastrophe and consequent punishment. Moreover, the imprint of the Italian novella tradition is nowhere more ap parent than in the garden episode that endows the tale with its title. It has often 17 Carmen R. Rabell, Rewriting the Italian Novella in Counter-Reformation Spain (Woodbridge: Tamesis, 2003), p. 36. 18 Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, trans, by A. M. Sheridan Smith (London: Routledge, 2002), pp. 25-26. 19 In a fascinating article, Stephanie Dalley suggests that the Hanging Gardens were not actually located at Babylon but at Nineveh, alias 'old Babylon', having been constructed there around 700 bc by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (and not the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar).

The sister Teodosia is another of Zayas's key additions to the story. Constanza, Jorge, and Carlos each have counterparts in Boccaccio's tale as Dianora, Ansaldo, and Gilberto respectively. Dianora, a married woman, receives the unsolicited attention of Ansaldo. In order to dash his hopes, she sets him the seemingly impossible challenge of creating a beautiful garden during intensely cold January weather; Ansaldo successfully completes the task by employing a magician. Dianora is greatly distressed, repenting of her ill-advised pledge. Her husband, though angered by the bar tering of her chastity, gives her permission to keep her word. Moved by the husband's behaviour, Ansaldo frees Dianora of her promise, and the two men become firm friends; imitating their generous acts, the magician refuses pay ment. The intertextuality of Zayas's novella, however, is far richer and more abun dant than reference to Italian source material suggests. The motif of the Devil's pact was commonplace in medieval European literature, enjoying great po pularity from the thirteenth century onwards, having descended from the Theophilus legend. This tale was immortalized by Jacobus de Voragine in his thirteenth-century Legenda aurea.23 According to Jacobus's version of the legend, Theophilus served as a bishop's administrator in Sicily in the sixth cen tury. When Theophilus loses his position, he pledges his allegiance to the Devil through a written renunciation of his Christian faith. Although he is reinstated, he comes to regret his actions and has recourse to the Virgin Mary, who frees him from the Devil's service and retrieves his written oath. Theophilus joyfully publicizes the miraculous events before dying peacefully.24 In Spain, Gonzalo de Berceo retold the Theophilus legend, selecting it to be the final miracle (no. xxv) of his Milagros de Nuestra Senora.25 Contempora neously, Alfonso X's Cantigas de Santa Maria?specifically, the third cantiga? 21 Lena E. V. Sylvania, Dona Maria de Zayas y Sotomayor: A Contribution to the Study of Her Works (New York: AMS, 1966), pp. 26-34. Sylvania notes that Boccaccio had already told a similar story in his Filocolo; the story is often described as being Oriental in origin. 22 Giovanni Boccaccio, The Decameron, trans, by G. H.

Twenty-four of the cantigas were translated into Spanish prose, a remodelled and expanded version of the Theophilus story be ing among their number.27 In these works the souls of the men who enter into diabolical pacts are ultimately saved. Similar plots involving thieves' diabolical pacts appear in Juan Manuel's El Conde Lucanor ('Exemplo xlv') and in Juan Ruiz's Libro de buen amor ('Enxienplo del ladron que fizo carta al Diablo de su anima').28 The Theophilus legend later inspired Golden Age playwrights, such as Mira de Amescua (El esclavo del demonio, 1612), and may have been another remote source for Zayas's tale.29 Another well-known legend, which is also recounted by Jacobus de Vora gine, tells the third-century story of Cyprian and Justina of Antioch. According to this, the magician Cyprian made a pact with the Devil in order to seduce Justina, a convert to Christianity.30 Justina's victory convinces Cyprian of the superiority of her faith, and he too defeats the Devil and lives a devout Christian life until, with Justina, he is martyred by the heathen authorities. This legend famously inspired Calderon's El mdgico prodigioso, which was originally commissioned for the celebration of Corpus Christi in the town of Yepes (Toledo) in 1637, the year in which Zayas's Novelas amorosas y ejemplares was published. We have seen that the pivotal garden links Zayas's story with ancient won ders, as well as with the Italian novella tradition. Jorge's immoral aim, the gra tification of his carnal desire for Constanza, echoes that of the aforementioned Cyprian and other Spanish Faustian figures. Through the diabolical pact, the tale can be inserted into a centuries-old literary tradition. None the less, Zayas develops a familiar story in an original manner, dwelling upon the trickery of Teodosia against her sister and providing us with a thought-provoking and theologically subversive case of injustice. Unlike the aforementioned in 26 Alfonso X, el Sabio, Cantigas de Santa Maria, ed. by Walter Mettmann, 3 vols (Madrid: Castalia, 1986-89), 1, 61-62.

In the prose version of Alfonso X, the basis of the legend is altered: Theophilus is not a cleric but a married man of diminishing wealth. None the less, in all versions Theophilus sells his soul to the Devil through a written document. 28 Juan Manuel, El Conde Lucanor, ed. by Alfonso I.

Within this story, only the Devil can preserve them both from earthly condemnation and eternal damnation. As I shall show, it is the Devil who resolves the problems that are engendered in Zayas's jardin enganoso, a resolution which can be connected to events in the frame narrative. The anthropomorphism of the Devil in Zayas's garden is far from being a gratuitous literary technique; the subversive demonic recasting as an entity capable of good can be read as a revisionist myth that challenges the most fundamental oppositions imposed by traditional doctrine'.31 This represents the ultimate baroque equivocation: the Devil unexpectedly supplants God as an agent of good and comes to the aid of Jorge, Constanza, and Carlos by resolving their interrelated predicaments. The circumstances of his entrance are conventional, and, in a dramatic exit, he disappears in a cloud of smoke, representing the typical light/dark dialectic of good and evil. Evidently, his generous act is atypical of demonic literary figures. Zayas's Devil is a complex and ambiguous figure, a creation of both light and dark, neither entirely good nor wholly evil. In order to discover the wider significance of the Devil's garden motif, it is necessary to examine the frame narrative in the Novelas amorosasy ejemplares. Specifically, we must turn to the scene of the tales' narration: Laura and Lisis's quarters. There, a sarao is planned in order to alleviate the love-sickness induced in Lisis by her unreciprocated love for Juan, who has rejected her in favour of her cousin Lisarda. It is revealing to note that the frame tale portends the later allusion to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in 'El jardin enganoso', indicating greater interconnectedness between frame and novella. Thus, by exploring the relationship between these narrative levels, the reader can participate in Zayas's intratextual game. In Zayas's 'Introduction' to the Novelas amorosas y ejemplares, the setting of the sarao?el cuarto de la hermosa Lisis'?is minutely described (p. 169). The detailed description of clothing and furnishings is a feature in Zayas's prose which was later shared by her successor in the novella genre, Mariana de Carvajal.32 Zayas's frame gathering takes place in 'una sala aderezada de unos costosos panos flamencos, cuyos boscajes, flores y arboledas parecian las selvas de Arcadia o los pensiles huertos de Babilonia' (p. 169). In the room 31 Amy R. Williamsen, 'Engendering Interpretation: Irony as Comic Challenge in Maria de Zayas', Romance Languages Annual, 3 (i99i)&gt; 642-48 (p. 646). 32 See Caroline B. Bourland, 'Aspectos de la vida del hogar en el siglo xvn segun las novelas de D.a Mariana de Carabajal y Saavedra', in Homenaje ofrecido a Menendez Pidal: Misceldnea de estudios linguisticos, literarios e historicos, 3 vols (Madrid: Hernando, 1925), n, 331-68.</page><page sequence="10">eavan o'brien 1017 there are also chairs of green velvet and a 'rico estrado' covered in cushions of the same material; as centrepiece, and for Lisis's comfort in her weakened physical state, there is a Vistosa Camilla [. . .] asimismo de brocado verde' (p. 169).33 Thus, the lavish indoor scene of the storytelling resembles another wondrous, man-made garden. This is not the only parallel that exists between the frame narrative and ?E1 jardin enganoso'. Lisis's mother Laura narrates this tale on the final night; as harbinger of the miracle of nature that she will recount, the day dawns with unseasonably fine weather: 'siendo diciembre, parecia mayo, y siendo invierno, primavera' (p. 483). By this stage, another gentleman?Diego?has sought and been granted el si de la dama [Lisis] y su madre [Laura] de que seria su esposa' (p. 409). Laura has thus consented to the match, and her tale lends it further tacit approval. The initial courtship of Constanza by Jorge, which is cut short through Teodosia's interference, offers a parallel to the conflict that exists between Lisis, Juan, and Lisarda. The cousins' rivalry echoes that which underlies the sisters' relationship in Laura's tale. Through marriage to another suitor, Carlos, Constanza achieves happiness. Likewise, we may deduce that Laura has a similar wish: joy for Lisis, her daughter, through marriage to the devoted Diego. This subtle pro-marriage stance may be the hidden message that Laura's listeners overlook while, instead, succumbing to Teodosia's game. In overseeing the marriage plans of Lisis and Diego, Laura occupies a similar observational role to the lauded Devil, the benevolent facilitator of marriage in 'El jardin enganoso'. Like Laura's story, the Novelas amorosas y ejemplares ends on an optimistic note; the reader is promised a 'segunda parte' to depict Lisis's wedding (p. 534). Both within the Novelas amorosas y ejemplares and beyond the frontiers of Zayas's text, therefore, the garden acquires a far greater significance than is initially apparent. The garden has a central role in Laura's novella, a tale of deception in which gender relations are assigned a prominent position. Once we locate this novella in its literary context, Zayas's intertextual game is un veiled, and examination of the frame narrative adds an intratextual facet to the wondrous creation of this 'Garden of Deceit'. As I have shown, disenchanting and ludic features coexist in this tale and in its frame; ultimately, the former aspect predominates as the Desenganos amorosos takes root where the Devil's jardin enganoso once lay. Trinity College Dublin Eavan O'Brien 33 Moreover, we are told that the predominant green hue symbolizes a hope that Lisis does not feel: como tan ajena de esperanzas en lo interior, quiso en lo exterior mostrar tenerlas' (p. 169). The furnishings screen the 'reality' of her feelings. The omniscient narrator of Zayas's 'Introduction' reveals the disappointment in love that Lisis has recently experienced.</page></plain_text>
