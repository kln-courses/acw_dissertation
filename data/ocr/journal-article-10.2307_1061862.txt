<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ake Hultkrantz NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGION IN THE HISTORY OF RESEARCH: A GENERAL SURVEY PART III* VI The field research performed by Boas and his pupils broadened the knowledge of American Indian religion immensely. New scientific problems emerged and were courageously attacked-and allegedly explained-by the field investigators themselves, and old issues were resumed and illustrated in the light of the new experiences. Problems posed by European theoreticians, such as the priority of animism and the validity of the high-god concept, were also reflected in this debate. Historical perspectives dominated, and culture-historical procedures founded on Boas' insights slowly replaced evolutionistic ones. To a certain extent also, European ethnologists and historians of religion contributed to the debate. Their points of view were still partly evolutionistic, although strong historical winds now started to blow from Vienna and Frankfurt. Also sociologists and social psychologists appeared on the scene. For natural reasons the main debate was, however, conducted in America. * Part I of this survey by Professor Hultkrantz appeared in Vol. 6, No. 2 (November, 1966); Part II appeared in Vol. 6, No. 3 (February, 1967); and Part IV is scheduled to appear in Vol. 7, No. 2 (November, 1967).-EDITORS]. 13</page><page sequence="2">North American Indian Religion At the same time as, in Europe, R. R. Marett developed his thoughts on pre-animistic religion (with specific reference to Bishop Codrington's writings on the mana of Melanesia), the Iroquois ethnologist, J. N. B. Hewitt, presented an article in which he asserted that the notion of orenda among the Iroquois corre- sponded in fact to the ideas of "mystic potence" which might be found, he said, in all religions.l Moreover, he suggested that orenda should be the terminus technicus for this power.2 It is obvi- ous that at that time Hewitt was ignorant of Codrington's and Marett's works, for mana is not mentioned in his article. Many theorists later on, when the concept of mana fell into disrepute in scientific quarters, questioned Hewitt's interpretation of orenda as an impersonal power. However, they have done so in vain, for orenda is one of the most convincing proofs of such a conception that can be found.3 Hewitt thought he could find a counterpart to Iroquoian orenda in the manitou of the Algonkian Indians. This suggestion evidently struck William Jones, for in an article on the Algonkian manitou published a few years later, he identified this concept with the idea of a mysterious cosmic power to be found everywhere in Nature.4 Jones's opinion of the import of the word, although grounded on linguistic materials, has not convinced other students. Allowing for a variation of meaning in different Algonkian tribes5-Jones's data mainly referred to the Fox Indians-it may be stated that manitou indicates rather a supernatural quality than supernatural power.6 A manitou is a supernatural being, which mostly means: a spirit.7 Whereas Hewitt saw in orenda a distinctive power in each individual situation, Jones developed the idea that it was an "abstract conception of a diffused, all-pervasive, invisible, manipu- lable, and transferable life-energy, or universal force." This inter- pretation was certainly motivated by his identification of manitou 1 J. N. B.

He found that the language of these Indians was so constructed that "instead of thinking of so many different objects, they think of one diffused into many." Each spirit is, consequently, a manifestation of "the ocean of supernatural energy."9 Among the Siouan Omaha, finally, the celebrated anthropologist Alice C. Fletcher, closely collaborating with the tribal member Francis La Flesche, found a similar meaning attached to the concept of wakonda. Wakonda, she stated, "is the name given to the mysterious all-pervading and life-giving power to which certain anthropomorphic aspects are attributed," and the same name "is also applied to objects or phenomena regarded as sacred or mysterious."10 We need not here further develop Miss Fletcher's interpretation which, particularly after the publication of her remarkable monograph on the Omaha, drew much attention from the scientific world.11 The reaction to the interpretations referred to above was very different in different quarters. Boas, sober as usual, was con- vinced that the belief in "magic power" was a fundamental con- cept in American Indian religion, but did not accept the view that it denoted universal power.12 Radin refuted entirely the idea that Indians believed in such a thing as supernatural power. Belief in such a power was, in his opinion, not a fact but an interpretation without foundation in facts.13 To Radin, concepts such as manitou and wakan (among the Dakota) revealed a belief in spirits. "Animism, then, in the old Tylorian sense of the term, is the belief of the Indians," he declared.14 This was obviously no correct interpretation. First, Lowie showed that Radin gave evidence of "a quite un-Tylorian indifference," since he did not derive his 8 J. M.

The discussion around orenda, manitou, and wakonda was not confined to America but went on also in Europe where researchers such as Preuss, F. R. Lehmann, Soderblom, Schmidt, Beth, and Arbman wrestled with these concepts. The idea of manitou and wakonda as a general, cosmic energy represented in individual instances appealed to Preuss; he found that this cosmic energy was supposed to penetrate all life on earth and cause it to move.16 A similar standpoint was taken by Beth, whereas Lehmann, Soderblom, Schmidt, and Arbman defended the view that the concepts adduced expressed a quality, not a universal potency. The latter interpretation gained ground among the students in both hemispheres, and no researcher today would subscribe to Preuss's and Beth's opinion. Nevertheless, the latter had a certain foundation in the materials supplied by Miss Fletcher and Swanton -if these materials were not, as Radin thought, formed by the field investigators' own leading ideas. The last-mentioned hypothesis was shared by Arbman. He con- sidered that Miss Fletcher's description of Omaha religion evinced an idealizing tendency which was due partly to the fact that these Indians had been influenced by Christianity.17 Arbman found that such a concept as wakonda partly denoted a quality, as well as beings provided with this quality, and meant partly the totality of gods, or at least a category of gods; and it was in the latter sense that wakonda had been misunderstood by Miss Fletcher.18 Arbman could here adduce the physician J. R. Walker's excellent mono- graph on the sun dance of another Siouan tribe, the Oglala (Dakota), in which the ideas of the gods and the universe were presented together with the description of the dancing ritual. Walker's informants, the medicine men, provided him with remarkable materials on the classification of gods, and working on this basis Walker thought he could identify a kind of mythological system which, according to him, was accepted as true by the Indians.19 He thus worked out the presumed shamanistic doctrine 15 R.

The idea of wakonda alternates, as Miss Fletcher has shown (see above), between a personal god and a quality belonging to the gods.24 Because of its vagueness, the concept of the Supreme God was difficult to analyze for early ethnologists (Swanton) and was mistaken for a universal mana by some theorists (Preuss, Beth), and a collective name for gods by others (Arbman). As a matter of fact, aboriginal North America supplies us with some of the best examples of a belief in Supreme Beings that can be found. In particular did new information from the Californian Indians impress students of religion during the first decades of our century. Curtin's records from the Wintun, Dixon's from the Maidu, Kroeber's from Central California show the existence of a belief in a lofty Creator and a creatio ex nihilo. These records were later supplemented by field material from other Indian groups, particularly the Pawnee (Grinnell, G. A. Dorsey) and Algonkian tribes (Grinnell, Skinner, Dorsey, Speck, and others). In an early paper on Californian Indian religion, Kroeber underlined the fundamental importance of the Creator concept and its antithesis, the concept of the Trickster (Coyote).25 It is remarkable, however, 20 Ibid., pp. 78 ff. 21 Ibid., pp. 57, 79 f. 22 The Dakota Indian linguist Ella Deloria has many unpublished materials which illuminate another interpretation of the religious system than the one given by Walker. 23 F.

Lang had already presented the Australian high gods to the educated public; some students had rejected his evidence while others, like for instance Marett, inter- preted these gods as a late development in primitive religion. The new evidence from America strengthened Lang's position that the belief in high gods belonged to a very early phase in human history.27 The North American material also stimulated Wilhelm Schmidt who, in the second and fifth volumes of his great work on the origin of the idea of god, included lengthy quotations from the field reports on Californian Indian, Algonkian, Salish, and Eskimo religions.28 A condensed treatise on the North American high gods was also written by the same author.29 To Schmidt, these materials constituted proofs of his general idea that the high-god concept preceded in time any other religious concept-an idea which he tried to base on the cultural-historical position of the tribes involved. There is no reason here to dwell upon his Kul- turkreislehre which, in the form he gave it, has long ago been dis- missed as a scientific tool. Allowing for the many mistakes in the control of sources and other technical shortcomings in Schmidt's literary production we may, however, say that he succeeded in proving the extensive occurrence of the belief in high gods among primitive societies. Some of his finest examples have been obtained from the Indians of North America. Schmidt's investigations of the North American high gods served as a basis for his efforts to establish a temporal differentia- tion of North American religions. The Yuki, Kato, and other Northwest Central Californian tribes and tribelets had, according to him, the oldest religious pattern, characterized by a Supreme Being closely associated with the thunder and the rainbow, and by a 26 A. L. Kroeber, The History of Native Culture in California ("University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology," Vol. XX [Berkeley, 1923]), p. 134. 27 Here it must be admitted that in his accounts of North American theism Lang did not clearly recognize the difference between Supreme Beings and culture heroes: see, e.g., A. Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion (2d ed.; London, 1899), II, 60 ff. Cf. S6derblom, below. 28 W. Schmidt, Der Ursprung der Gottesidee (Miinster in Westfalen, 1929, 1934), Vols. II, V. 29 W. Schmidt, High Gods in North America (Oxford, 1933). 18</page><page sequence="7">creative assistant, usually the First Ancestor.30 In the eastern parts of northern central California the Maidu and other groups represented the next historical layer: the high god had here an antagonist, the Coyote, and the creation of the world included the diving of birds and animals into the primeval sea to fetch earth. Since the latter pattern could also be found among the Algonkian tribes, Schmidt supposed there had once been contact between Californian and Algonkian groups in the Canadian forest region. Because of certain religious and mythological affinities, the Salishan tribes were also referred to the same original area. The religions of the Californians, Algonkians, and Salish were finally linked with the religions of the "Arctic primeval culture" (Urkul- tur), represented by Caribou Eskimo, Samoyeds, and other Arctic groups.31 Schmidt's interpretations of the American data were questioned from many quarters, and an intensive discussion of the validity of his material also followed. Alternative suggestions of the import of the American high-god concepts were presented, for instance, by Nathan S6derblom. He defined these great gods as "originators" (Urheber), but in describing them he confused them with the culture heroes.32 The connections between the Supreme Being and the culture hero in North America puzzled many students of reli- gion in Europe, but also American anthropologists found them complicated. In an essay on primitive "monotheism", with most examples obtained from aboriginal North America, Radin assures us that if we find a Supreme Being with the attributes of a culture hero this represents a secondary development.33 As to the concept of the culture hero, Boas considered, in opposition to Brinton, that the sexual and egotistical motifs in the culture-hero tales are primary and that there is a gradual transition to a clearly altruistic series.34 It is interesting to note that Dixon found these ideas evolutionistic and therefore challenged them. The enigmatic position of the Supreme Being in North American native religion intrigued in particular two American anthropolo- 30 Cf. W.

The common people, the realists, have secondarily brought about the fusion between this lofty concept and the amoral culture hero.38 Similar views were expressed in Radin's Primitive Man as Philosopher.39 Later on in his work on primitive religion, Radin changed his opinion to the extent that he did not allow the belief in high gods to be called monotheism any longer. Still more important was his new state- ment that wherever such a god exists "it is the belief either of a few individuals or of a special group," namely, the religious thinkers.40 This accounts for the otiose character of these high gods. In his last books on the subject, Radin went even further: the high gods of North America are all, with one exception, the Tirawa of the Pawnee, explained as developments from Christian stimuli.41 As was so often the case, however, Radin was not consistent in his points of view: the Winnebago Earthmaker is said to antedate Christian teachings.42 In contradistinction to Radin, Lowie was very careful in his evaluation of the North American data on Supreme Beings. As noted down by Bidney, he finally accepted, with certain modifica- tions, Schmidt's proofs of a quite common belief in such beings among primitive peoples.43 It is apparent, however, that Lowie hesitated to generalize the evidence insofar as it concerned North American Indians.44 Never interested in patterns and systems, he 35 Cf.

We may say with certain justification that americanists were inclined to accept the North American high-god ideas as genuine, but with few exceptions-Radin, Swanton45-did they care to formulate a high-god theory. The interest was greater in Europe where Preuss, Soderblom, Schmidt, and others co-ordinated the North American findings with similar conceptions from other regions. The theistic concepts were also analyzed in Loewenthal's study of Eastern Algonkian religion.46 This and Kroeber's account of Californian Indian religion were the first treatises on regional North American native religion. Loewenthal also produced an initiated article on the culture hero in eastern North America.47 Most American anthropologists were less interested in the culture hero as a metaphysical concept than in his activities as a trickster in the myths. Indeed, the trickster cycle looms large in North American myth collections, assembled and published during this period. Some tales contain decidedly religious motifs, but even if these occasionally were observed, as in Kroeber's footnotes to his collection of Arapaho traditions,48 they were mostly overlooked and drowned in the huge mass of epic materials. This leads us to the problem of the place of myths and legends during the Boasian regime. The past period of research had been characterized by a genuine interest in the religious aspects of myths and legends. We may distinguish three major lines in interpretation before the appearance of Boas: first, the evolutionistic approach as manifested in Powell's and Brinton's myth analyses, discussed in the foregoing; second, the "naturistic" theories of Max Miiller and his school, evinced in Brinton's writings and in several other papers, for instance, in Wardle's interpretation of the Eskimo Sedna cycle as a symbolic rendering of the day cycle (with later additional symbolism);49 and third, the ritual approach to myth, represented by Matthews.50 The evolutionistic myth 45 J.

On the other hand, German americanists were affected by it, in particular Hugo Kunike.52 One leading German americanist, Paul Ehrenreich, found good evidence that the South American myths lent themselves to an interpretation along solar-mythological lines.53 The final blow to naturist mythology in America was thrust by Waterman in his examination of etiological myths in North America. Waterman found that hundreds of explanations of natural phenomena were scattered throughout the North American Indian tales, but that in most cases they were loosely added to the tales without being important parts of them.54 Waterman's essay was clearly in line with the general trend at that time among American anthropologists-notably Boas, Lowie, Dixon, and Goldenweiser-to tear to pieces former assumptions and recon- structions within their science which lacked a sound foundation in reality. Matthews' aforementioned studies of the conjunction between myth and ritual, finally, had no immediate effects on mythological theory. His insistence on the priority of myth over ritual ran counter to contemporary trends in Europe as represented by Frazer, Robertson Smith, and, later on, Harrison. Harrison's Themis (1912), which became so influential as the first exposition of the myth-and-ritual school, proceeded from the presumption that myths arise out of rites, and not the other way round. Boas and his followers seem to have embraced a similar view. Indeed, it may be a matter of a strange convergence that already in 1898 Boas could pronounce that "ritual moulds the explanatory myth."55 In the same connection, he claimed that "oft-repeated 51 R.

As a matter of fact, although Boas deserves our praise for the inspiration he gave to myth collectors, and for the extensive myth collections he recorded himself in native languages, his approach to myths was clearly a regression from an earlier period as far as concerns the religious point of view. Myths were not any more primarily observed with respect to their religious contents. As a genre they were not differentiated from other oral narratives.57 Their value lay in the contribution they could give to our under- standing of the diffusion mechanisms and, at least in the eyes of Boas' pupils, to the reconstruction of American Indian culture history. Boas was also, as we have seen, keenly interested in the ways in which myths mirrored culture, and he distinguished (although not consequently, as shown by Barbeau) between the esoteric tales of the common tribesman and the esoteric tales of the specialist, the medicine man or member of a secret society.58 (This fruitful line was later further developed by Radin.) Boas' surprising indifference to the religious import of myths and legends is reflected in the fact that he, with so many later folklorists, primarily stressed their literary quality: "The one-sided emphasis laid upon the intimate relation between religion and mythology obscures the imaginative play that is involved in the formation of myths."59 He shared this general attitude with Radin, as we have also seen. Boas and his circle of anthropologists made a great impression on folklorists, and it is no exaggeration to say that they even domin- eered the American Folklore Society. Stith Thompson was a folklorist, not an anthropologist, but his work on North American Indian traditions is marked by the double heritage from Boas and the Finnish folklorist school (Krohn, Aarne). His foremost work was a representative corpus of North American tales.60 It is still the best presentation of its kind, although we now have a modern 56 Ibid. 57 Cf. F.

Alexander analyzed Indian beliefs and myths as testimonies of a religious philosophy. Interested initially in the art and mythology of the Pawnee, Alexander soon became absorbed by American Indian mythology in general. He wrote a learned work on North American mythology which is still a helpful source of reference to students of American Indian religion;63 it was later followed by a similar book on Central and South American aboriginal myth- ology.64 Some years afterwards he issued a paper on Pueblo Indian ritual dances.65 His later works were mostly more sub- jective, endeavouring to reveal the eternal values of North American Indian mythical and ritual speculation. One book appeared as a result of his activities as a guest lecturer on American Indian art and philosophy at the Sorbonne;66 another was pub- lished posthumously and communicates to us his over-all view of "the white pages of American Indian thought and understand- ing."67 Alexander's approach to his subject reminds us of the Santee Indian doctor Charles Alexander Eastman's ("Ohiyesa") Einfihlung into Plains Indian religion,68 and his concepts of uni- versalism and symbolism point forward to recent ideas among historians of religion (Eliade), anthropologists (Redfield, Brown), and philosophers of religion (Schuon). It is impossible to review here all books and articles which, during the Boas period and its immediate sequence, were pub- lished on North American myths and legends. Suffice it to say, with 61 T. P.

A wealth of folklore material was also recorded by the Canadian ethnologist Marius Barbeau, whose early publications include works on Iroquoian myths and legends, as well as analyses of Iroquoian myths and religious ideas.70 In later years Barbeau has written monographs on such topics as Haida myths (the Haida are the Indians of Queen Charlotte Islands) and totem poles.71 The latter work, a study of North Pacific totem poles and their associated legends, as well as the same author's paper on North- western Indian totemism,72 bring us to our next subject, the issue of totemism. Next to such topics as orenda, the Great Spirit, the culture hero and the myths relating to him, totemism was a favorite theme with Boas and his followers. The interest in totemism, started by MacLennan (1866), had been revived by Frazer and Robertson Smith.73 American field ethnologists soon found that totemistic phenomena occurred in many Indian societies, often associated with what has later been called "manituism" or "individual totemism": the belief in a personal guardian spirit. As Alice Fletcher could point out for the Omaha, there were many simi- larities between totems and guardian spirits, and the human attitude to them was also similar. Therefore, she concluded, the totem of the social group (in this case a gens or patrilineal sib) must have come into existence in the same manner as the personal guardian spirit, and must have represented the manifestation of an ancestor's vision.74 Boas stated that among the Kwakiutl the 69 S.

However, the theory is still considered probable by many scholars, particularly in Germany (for instance, by Baumann and Haekel). While this theory was being formed, new viewpoints on totem- ism were presented in important Australian field monographs. Their effect on European theoreticians in culture and religion was considerable. To Durkheim and Freud, Australian totemism be- came the beginning of religion. American thinkers reacted differ- ently. Goldenweiser, working with both American and Australian data, refuted Durkheim's ideas and even challenged the concept of totemism. Not only did he prove that totemism is not a typical phenomenon among very primitive peoples, but he also ques- tioned its character as an integral phenomenon. Such features as clan exogamy, animal names of social groups, and beliefs in descent from an animal have, Goldenweiser opined, a complex historical and psychological derivation. Under special psycho- sociological conditions they enter into intimate association with one another, thus constituting a totemic complex.78 There followed 75 F. Boas, "The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians," Report of the United States National Museum (Washington, 1897), p. 336. It should be observed, however, that Boas did not generalize his findings among the Kwakiutl; on the contrary, he believed in the diversification of the totemistic processes (see Boas, "The Origin of Totemism," Race, Language and Culture, pp. 316 ff.). 76 A.

If totemism, for a time at least, seemed to have lost its substance and to have evaporated in the eyes of many American anthro- pologists, the belief in guardian spirits remained as a simple and undeniable fact. Indeed, it was so widespread in North America that in some measures it colored the general idea of Indian religions. Radin, for instance, called it "the most characteristic feature of Indian religion."79 Earlier students of aboriginal reli- gion had observed the importance of this belief, and in its most extreme form, as "nagualism" (where the client takes part of its tutelary's life and character), it had been analyzed, inter alios, by Brinton.80 The indefatigable Frazer collected a treasure trove of evidence of guardian-spirit beliefs and the associated vision quest.81 However, it was Ruth Benedict, a pupil of Boas', who undertook the first penetrating analysis of this complex of beliefs and attitudes.82 In her work, which has become a classic in anthro- pology and religious ethnology, she pays particular attention to the types of guardian-spirit experience and to the relation of this spirit concept to other cultural and religious features: ancestor spirits, puberty ordeals, totemism, shamanism, etc. Although oriented from the quantitative methods of her teacher, Benedict's investiga- tion still makes a versatile impression and conserves many points of view which can be profitably used by modern students of religion. Also other American anthropologists dealt with guardian- spirit ideas, for instance, Lowie in his studies of Crow religion. Benedict was, however, more interested in social psychology than in religious phenomenology. She therefore made much out of the fact that she found the vision more inclusive and more universal than the guardian-spirit concept. She spoke of "the social recogni- tion of the vision as the fundamental and typical religious fact of North America."83 The vision experience was the common element behind the changing figures of guardian spirits, but it was also patterned according to local historical presuppositions, as Benedict 79 Radin, "Religion of the North American Indians," p. 294. 80 D.

The distribution studies which characterized most of the studies on totemism, guardian spirits, and vision were brought into a wider frame when A. I. Hallowell published his well-known mono- graph on bear ceremonialism.86 The contacts between northern Asia and northern North America, including those of religious and magic import, had partly been established by the Jesup North Pacific Expedition at the turn of the century. Bogoras, one of the members of the expedition, had written an important study of the myths and religious beliefs common to both continents at their junction in the North.87 The same subject fascinated several other scholars, for instance, Speck and Lowie,88 and reached its climax with Hallowell's investigation. From another point of view, Hallowell's work is the first treatise on the hunters' religion in North America, if we exclude Frazer's preoccupation with animal ceremonialism in one of the volumes of the Golden Bough.89 As such, Hallowell's paper has stimulated later studies on the bear cult in Siberia and in North America; as concerns North America, we may think of contributions made by Speck, Barbeau, and others.90 In addition to the hunting rites and allied concepts, the cere- monialism around the fish and sea animals also came into focus. 84 Benedict, "The Vision in Plains Culture," American Anthropologist, XXIV, No. 1 (1922), 1 ff. 85 J.

Thus, the dissemina- tion of the salmon ceremonial was compared to that of the bear cult. Later on, Margaret Lantis illuminated the whale ceremonial- ism in Alaska,92 and Kroeber and Gifford finally analyzed the Northwest Californian salmon rites in their wider setting as world- renewal rites (cf. Part II of the present paper). We shall later list some European contributions to this and adjoining problem complexes. Besides the Jesup Expedition, the greatest ethnological under- taking of the Boas era was the series of investigations of the sun- dance ceremonial of the Plains Indians sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History. Some work on this ritual had already been accomplished, notably by the Chicago anthropologist George A. Dorsey. The latter made circumstantial accounts of the Arapaho and Cheyenne dances with some observations of the myths and beliefs surrounding them.93 In comparison with these works, the investigations under the auspices of Clark Wissler and the American Museum of Natural History appear perhaps more technical, but also more sterile. Wissler's interest was less directed toward the religious system and symbolism than toward the ritual elements of the dance, for these elements could be arranged in diffusional series and serve as building pieces in his culture-area theory. This does not mean to say that the series of papers on the dance which Wissler introduced was as such deficient. There were particular difficulties: some of the dances described had not been performed for a long time. Lowie, for instance, had to rely on the faithful memories of his Crow informants, for the last Crow sun dance of the old style was held in the 1870's.94 One contributor, the above-mentioned J. R. Walker, was, as we have found, particularly 91 E. Gunther, "An Analysis of the First Salmon Ceremony," American Anthro- pologist, XXVIII, No. 4 (1926), 605 ff.; A Further Analysis of the First Salmon Ceremony ("University of Washington Publications in Anthropology," Vol. II, No. 5 [Seattle, 1928]), pp. 129 ff. 92 M.

Wissler, for instance, paid only casual attention to the mythological frame of the Blackfoot sun dance. The subject was pushed aside under the heading "mythological notes" at the end of his paper, and only two out of fifty pages were given to it.97 The last contribution in the series was Spier's comparative investigation of the Plains sun-dance complex.98 It has for a long time been considered a model of the ethnological methods used by Wissler and his generation. Spier listed the ritual elements according to their quantitative distribution; and by analyzing their diffusion, their climax, and their "measure of coherence," he found that the Central Plains tribes, the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Oglala, must have originated the ceremony. By the same distri- butional operation he was able to establish that the dance was originally organized under individual leadership, not under fraternities. Spier's plotting procedure, built upon Wissler's and Sapir's methodological assumptions, was typical of the mechanistic, "flat" historical perspective which, as we have seen, dominated American ethnology in those days (see Part II). His paper was admirably worked out, but it had to stand up to much criticism.99 It is no surprise that the sober and critical-minded author later denounced his methods and results.100 This did not mean that the quantitative and statistical approaches to the history of the sun dance had come to an end, for ten years after the appearance of Spier's study Clements published a paper on the correlation of tribes with sun-dance data.'10 95 See the reference above, n. 19. 96 Ella Deloria (cf. above) has written a later study of the same sun dance, "The Sun Dance of the Oglala Sioux," Journal of American Folklore, XLII (1929), 354 ff. 97 C.

Part IV of the present paper). Looking back at the sun-dance papers written by Wissler and his colleagues, one cannot but regret that the meaning and func- tion of the dance was so completely neglected. Latter-day anthro- pologists are aware of this deficiency. Eggan thus declares that "despite all the studies of the Sun Dance we still do not have an adequate account giving us the meaning and significance of the rituals for the participants and for the tribe. One such account would enable us to revalue the whole literature of the Sun Dance."102 This view seems quite correct.103 Perhaps a student of religion with ethnological background would be the best man to unveil the sun-dance ideology. Meanwhile, we can proceed from the hypothesis put forth by Wilhelm Schmidt and later elaborated by Werner Miiller that the sun dance represents, from its start, a yearly thanksgiving to the Supreme Being.104 Even if this hypothesis does not fit all the facts of the "ethnographical present," it explains the dance as a whole and thereby fulfils some of the more essential demands which a student of comparative religion might present.105 There are other themes which were discussed by Boas and his disciples, and subsequently treated by European ethnologists and historians of religion (mostly in general reference works and phenomenological surveys). Some of them figured in passing in our preceding account of Boas and his pupils. We may here men- tion the ritual organizations, some of which functioned in con- nection with the sun dance; the secret societies of the North Pacific Coast, the Southwest, and the Great Lakes area; the religious practitioners (shamans and priests); the religious and areligious individualists, etc. Most of these themes kept their actuality in ethnological debate long after the Boas period had ended, since they were a natural outcome of the field research. In this way they differ markedly from the themes introduced by European scholars, such as animism, animatism, monotheism, etc. To be sure, such items may turn up in the field materials, but they 102 F.

Lowie once told the present writer that if his European colleagues really had experienced Indian fieldwork they would not have committed themselves so easily to all-explaining theories. It is no wonder that the carefully collected North American Indian data of the Boas period frequently appeared in con- temporaneous European comparative studies. The cultural histor- ians of Germany and Austria, the extreme diffusionists of Britain, and the sociologists and social psychologists of France alike often drew on the American Indian materials to illustrate their points of view. Similar works were only to a slight extent published in the United States, for the empiricism and skepticism of Boas had become a virtue among American anthropologists, and conse- quently far-reaching generalizations on religion had a suspect reputation. If we should characterize the theoretical work on North Ameri- can Indian religion performed during the first decades of this century, we might say that the American approach suffered from the writers' behavioristic bias and, usually, secondary interest for religion, but profited from their first-hand knowledge of aboriginal religion. The Europeans, on the other hand, were shut off from this immediate contact with the field, and consequently had not always a clear picture of what Indian religions were like. In dis- cussing them they made theoretical generalizations which were often unacceptable to their better-informed American colleagues. Still, they were, in contradistinction to the latter, on the whole more genuinely interested in religion as such. There were, of course, exceptions to this general rule. We have met some American anthropologists who had an open sense for religion, for instance, Lowie, Radin, Speck, and Swanton. Several monographs on Indian religions by these and other authors have been mentioned in the foregoing, and more could be cited.106 Also, not all of the Europeans writing on North American native religions were armchair students any longer. We have already referred to Preuss, who made ethnographical field trips to tribes in the Mexican Sierra Madre area (which, liberally, may be 106 See in particular, C. G.

Uhlenbeck, a Dutch linguist who worked among the Black- foot.108 In spite of many shortcomings, the achievements in the knowl- edge of North American Indian religion were considerable during the time that Boas guided American research, and most contri- butions were, of course, coming from the United States and Canada. At the end of the period it was possible to write compre- hensible surveys of Indian religions, surveys which still may be considered useful. In this category of works belong Alexander's book on mythology, Lowie's study of primitive religion (which largely deals with North American data), and Krickeberg's account of North American ethnography, inclusive of religion.109 A remarkably well-informed series of sketches of Indian religion was presented in Curtis' bulky and beautifully illustrated work on the North American Indian.l10 And in the well-known Encyclo- paedia of Religion and Ethics a staff of American anthropologists, including Goddard, Gray, Kroeber, Lowie, Prince, Sapir, Skinner, Spence, and Swanton, presented the salient facts of North Ameri- can aboriginal religions.111 Some final words must be said about an outstanding semi- popular book from this time. E. C. Parsons edited a collection of essays on North American Indian culture written by practically all the leading American ethnologists of the day. In this work informa- tive notes on Indian religion were presented in a fictional form by such eminent experts as Harrington, Lowie, Radin, Skinner, Swanton, and Wissler. In his introduction to the volume Kroeber wrote, inter alia: "The book is likely to make the impression that some sixty per cent of Indian life must have been concerned with religion. This imbalance is due to the fact that religion has become the best known aspect of Indian life. Ritual and ceremony follow exact forms which the native is able to relate with accuracy from memory, long after the practices have become defunct. Moreover, once his confidence is gained, he often delights in occupying his 107 K. Th.

Religion was not their prime interest, but religious facts were easier to record than other social facts. For obvious reasons, most of these religious facts con- cerned rites and ceremonies. This notwithstanding, more work was dedicated to religious subjects in those days than ever after- ward in American anthropology. There is quite a gap between the anthropological work in the early twenties and the corresponding work of the present day, when religion often figures only in the periphery of the investigations. The old generation of anthro- pologists could not of course anticipate this development. At the end of the Boas era they thought that the real study of Indian religions was now about to start. As Wissler expressed it: "The whole subject of mythical thought, philosophical, and religious conceptions as a New World contribution to man's history is still before us."113 112 E. C.
