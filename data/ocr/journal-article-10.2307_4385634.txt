I remember being delighted my freshman year of college when an elderly, hawk-nosed art history professor, a teacher who had somewhat frightened me, stam- mered over the word "clitoral" as he showed us a projection of O'Keeffe's Black Iris III. The image flickered slightly against the wall where it was projected, and the darkness of its petals, sepals, and haft dissolved into the darkness of the room. I feel that I noticed little-clitoral or otherwise- about it, but lately it has struck me that it is paradoxical to have a vivid memo- ry of failing to notice something. O'Keeffe's paintings have a way of bid- ing their time, and of absenting them- selves without fuss from our attention. Silently, and not unkindly, they make us aware that they will never need us the way we may well come to need them. The particular Georgia O'Keeffe painting I have come to need is called Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth; O'Keeffe painted it in 1938, and it hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago at the far end of the far wall in a gallery devoted to the Stieglitz Circle, a room in which O'Keeffe's work predomi- nates. It is smaller and more muted than the other paintings that surround it, and it feels stranger. A perfect egg shape dominates the upper two-thirds of the canvas, and a slightly lopsided orb rests in turn, like a yolk, in the upper half of the egg shape. The egg shape's color is rose mixed with adobe, and the orb layered over it is bruise- colored-or rather, it is the blushing rust color we imagine bruises are, not the dull gray-brown of the real bruises we find on our knees and elbows. The egg shape undulates out toward the edges of the canvas, but the space it preserves between itself and the edges is so gracefully even that it seems almost like a heart that has momentarily restrained itself from pulsing, either from some obscure sense of delicacy or from the desire to listen closely to a very quiet sound. An inverted jawbone lies like a horizon line beneath the egg shape, with three oversized teeth blooming out of it. The bone and teeth are variations of a bleached, sandy white, but O'Keeffe has shaded both them and the red and pink rocks above them, so neither lacks depth. A brown- ish shadow separates the creased, coved ridge of teeth from the underside of the pink rock; it's soft and charcoaly beneath the rock, darker and more geo- metric just above the teeth. As it fades into the background of the painting, it becomes a violet veil, hardly noticeable at first glance, which captures that sun- scorched, half-blind quality your gaze takes on in the late afternoon when you have spent the whole day outside in a hot place. The background is flat and shadowless-a light bluish-gray like the soft undersides of pigeons' wings. Is it sky, ground, wall, nothing? Looking at it, I came to feel that it was both all and none of these things. By at once demanding and resisting my efforts to place it, it sought to make me under- stand that I could not think of the stones and bones it framed as ordinary stones and bones. At the same time, it told me, I would be a fool if I thought of them as anything else. I know my new affinity for Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth is the result of the many days I have spent over the past six months driving to Western ghost towns. I became obsessed with them on a trip to Wyoming last sum- mer, when I decided to spend a day exploring the highways that skimmed past small-print towns called Bosler, Medicine Bow, Battle, Encampment. Since then, I have learned that ghost- towning involves crossing a set of boundaries I don't confront during the course of my ordinary life. Some of these boundaries are plain, and disqui- eting in their plainness; others are limi- nal and disquieting in their liminality. On your way to a ghost town you might pass a small, painted, wooden sign sagging by the side of the road that reads, "Get Us Out of the United Nations! Join the John Birch Society!" or a larger, less saggy sign that reads, "NO TRESPASSERS, THIS MEANS YOU, ALL SURVIVORS PROSECUT- ED." Those kinds of signs tell you where you're going in terms you can understand, but when in the middle of nowhere you pass a cloudy blue sign propped against a bent discarded gate that says in painstaking cursive, "Animal Mootel," things start to feel less legible. Nonetheless, this sign-the sign for the Animal Mootel-still clings to its genesis, to the person who paint- ed it and who, you must assume, had once hoped to start an Animal Mootel somewhere nearby. When you look at it, you feel it to be hungry and sorrow- ful, and it seems more human than the human who made it ever could or will. Abandoned objects-signs for Animal Mootels, metal box-springs, office chair seats torn off their ad- 24 THE THREEPENNY REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">justable stems, and especially houses and the bodies of cars-have their own way of dying. As they begin to fade they become psychically engorged, so that they call out to us as we pass them with pregnant howls; they ascend to their anthropomorphic summits in the months and years after we have cast them aside. Then somehow they con- tract, and turning inward to contem- -late their own souls, they have no more regard for ours. The true ghost towns are the places whose objects have turned inward. You know you have found one when you feel yourself getting tugged out of your own orbit as you step over a rusted can, or look through the doorway of a collapsed house-when you start to feel that if you were to remain where you were, you would cease to be able to maintain the discipline of being yourself, and of resting in your own skin. I had no idea that those things could be disciplines until I started ghost-towning. Even- tually others will find the Animal Mootel sign and it will look back at them unblinkingly. Its paint will crack off and it will break apart and slowly it will vanish. When I first saw O'Keeffe's painting, it reminded me of the decorative assem- blages of abandoned objects I had seen in some ghost towns, and more often in not-quite-ghost towns where a few peo- ple were still hanging on, or in strange desert anti-towns whose residents had come to hide out from the rest of the world. In these places, people only seem to bother planting flowers if there are a couple of old toilets around to plant them in, and they make beautiful fences out of neatly arranged bottle- necks and frying pans, which you can also see collected on shelves inside their shacks, if you're brave enough to peer in the windows. Once a man in Johannesburg, California invited me in to see the old motel he was living in, and I remember noticing that amid rodent-tattered curtains and old engine parts, a dusty plush koala sat as if enthroned. It is comforting to ignore all this-to think of it as circumstance or at best decoration, rather than as art-but occasionally I have come across assem- blages whose artists were clearly just as haunted and in love with their objects as I was. In one place (in California, of course), someone had built a teepee and put a Buddha in it with a red plastic funnel fitted perfectly over its head. In front of the teepee a typewriter sat on a row of crumbling old school desks, and nearby a ceramic deer lawn ornament with a broken ear had been wrapped in plastic pearls and given one long, twist- ing antler. Several cow skulls and a woman's head broken from a sculpture were enclosed within a heart arranged from small rocks. Most dazzling of all was a densely packed heap, painful to look at in the light, that included a white plastic pinwheel shaped like a daisy, several broken pots, a planter shaped like a snail, a ceramic Madonna and child, several toy dinosaurs (one with a cigarette poking out of its mouth), rocks, bones, and a child's head made from plaster. While these assemblages may not reflect O'Keeffe's sensibility, it is undeniable that they reflect sensibility; they have not strayed so far, after all, from O'Keeffe's famous gesture of putting a calico flower into the eye socket of a cow's skull. Slowly, though, as I looked at it, I began to realize that Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth was doing something very different-it was facing up to the uncanniness of its subject clear-sightedly. It was thinking as rigorously as it could about what it means to try to impose your imagination on the things that have relinquished it. The assemblages I had seen had either bullied their way through that question, even though it was what had dictated them in the first place, or they had grazed against it accidentally. Suddenly, by comparison, they began to remind me of the towers of blocks children build tenderly, with the secret knowledge that the greatest pleasure they'll get from building them will be the crash when they fall. Most of the objects and assemblages I have described were crafted by people at some point; O'Keeffe's rocks, teeth, and jawbone might never have been seen or touched by a human, until she found them and studied them. But the reverence and curiosity of her gaze stake a strange, motherly claim over them. Her way of paying attention to her rocks, teeth, and jawbone creates the time-battered ambiguity of a blood tie; she reclaims them, but she does so to show that they cannot be reclaimed. Lovingly, she abandons them, and her will has molded them in such a way that I can only understand them in terms of the ghost town objects I've seen. I HAVE described the rocks in O'Keeffe's painting as an egg shape and an orb, and I have imagined the bones as flowers and a horizon line. She has captured the way that her rocks and bones have become themselves so fully that from a distance, or at first glance, they look like nothing-or at least like nothing you can place, so that they press you to grope for likenesses you can hang onto. They are at once perversely still and perversely animated; despite their unfamiliarity, you are painfully aware that they are as definite and particular as precocious children. I realized this when my confusion about how to look at the painting led me to step backward, half-blur my gaze, and try to seek out pleasing symmetries that might allow me to escape its content. For me, trying to appreciate the paint- ing's compositional qualities on an abstract level felt like a retreat-like the spineless thing to do now that I'd found myself unexpectedly implicated by it. In assembling her floating rocks and her floating teeth, O'Keeffe has also disas- sembled them. She has undone the sense we have that if we just picked up the things that haunted us and set them down again in a way that pleased us, we would be able to conquer them. But now I have made Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth sound taxing-like a bright-eyed, vicious old aunt who may have lost interest in her own life but has not yet lost interest in yours. The paint- ing is not at all disciplinary; the demands it makes are gentle, and they feel justified. It reposes in its corner of the gallery quite peacefully. O'Keeffe's Red Hills with Flowers hangs next to it, and compels your eye first to its rich magentas and clay tones. You stand in front of Red Hills with Flowers, star- ing, and you only tip your chin to the left to glance at Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth once you've fed on it for some time. In this way, Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth feels a bit like an older sister, from that fairytale time when older sisters sat in the back- ground, sewing, while their younger sis- ters flung their arms passionately around visiting princes. If we did not know such an older sister's thoughts we might call them "wise"-depending on just how old she was-but if we did know them, "wise" might seem a bit reductive. Searching for the right word, we might instead call them "private," or maybe "prayerful." O</page></plain_text>
