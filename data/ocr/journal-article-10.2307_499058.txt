LucE, Editor-in-Charge Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. NECROLOGY J. W. Mackail. -The death of this eminent Brit- ish classicist, on December 13, 1945, at the age of eighty-six, is announced. Born in 1859, he was Profes- sor of Poetry at Oxford from 1906 until 1911, and an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College. In 1922-23 he was President of the Classical Association, and after his term at Oxford was Professor of Ancient Literature in the Royal Academy. He was a member of numerous learned societies, and held honorary degrees from Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Adelaide and Cambridge. His best known books in the Classical field are Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology (1890), Latin Litera- ture (1895), Lectures on Greek Poetry (1910), Classical Studies (1925), and a verse translation of the Odyssey (1932). He is survived by his wife, who was the only daughter of Sir Edward BurneJones, and they had one son and two daughters. Hayford Peirce.-This well-known specialist in Byzantine Art died, after a long illness, on March 4, 1946, in Bangor, Maine, at the age of sixty-two. Born in Bangor in 1883, he was graduated from Harvard College in the Class of 1906. After his graduation he lived for many years in Europe, both before and after the First World War, making his headquarters in Paris. During that war he had a distinguished record of service, taking part in the St. Mihiel offensive, and serving as an intelligence officer with the First and Second Armies. He was also attached to the American delegation at the Peace Conference. His major con- tributions to Byzantine studies came after the First World War, when he formed a collaboration with Royall Tyler; in 1926 their Byzantine Art appeared, and they also contributed the articles on this subject to the 1929 and subsequent editions of the Encyclo- paedia Britannica. In 1941 the Harvard Press pub- lished their papers on Byzantine Works of Art in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection. Of their major work, L'Art Byzantin, two volumes had appeared when the Sec- ond World War broke out, with a third in press when the Germans occupied Paris. In 1998 Peirce returned to Bangor, and engaged in business, but still found time to devote to his Byzantine studies. He was married in Bangor in 1937, and is survived by his widow and two sons. Casualties of the War. -It is learned on reliable sources that Professor Constantopoulos, Director of the Numismatic Museum at Athens, died in that city of starvation during the terrible winter of 1941-42; that Mario Segre was killed, with his wife and baby, in a German concentration camp on May 26, 1944; and that Maurice Feyel was transported from France to Germany, sent to a camp in the region of Bremen, and put to forced labor, from the effects of which he died in May or June, 1945. No official report has ever been received of his death, but the facts are appar- ently substantially as given here. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Silver and Lead in Antiquity. -R. J. FORBES fol- lows up his study on "Gold in the Ancient Near East" (cf. AJA. xliv, 1940, p. 361) with an equally thorough one on "Silver and Lead in Antiquity." Its bibliog- raphy comprises 313 numbers, with some others quoted in the text. "Natural silver was collected from the earliest times but its r6le in metallurgy remained insignificant until men learned to produce silver from lead and lead-ores.... It would seem that the refin- ing of silver and lead was worked out in Pontus in about the early third millennium B.c. and that this knowledge spread gradually over the ancient Near East until both metals were in common use in the fifteenth century B.C. By that time producing centers in Armenia, Carmania and possibly Elam supplied the rapidly growing demand for silver, which metal went South in exchange for Egyptian gold. ... At the beginning of the first millennium silver and lead were common metals in the Near East except in Egypt where they did not become common until the Persian period. Both lead and silver occur in Egypt from the Middle Predynastic Period. The sign htd for silver oc- curs since the Third Dynasty but the metal remains rare for many centuries. In the Pyramid Age it is rarer than gold and precedes this metal in lists and texts. It may have been imported from Syria and Asia Minor, but because silver production was hardly 293</page><page sequence="2">294 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY developed in these regions, it is more probable that the 'silver' used in Egypt was the silver-colored electrum. The analyses given by Lucas of silver objects dating before the Eighteenth Dynasty prove this, as they con- tain far more gold than would occur in silver derived from galena .... The first and essential process for the extraction of silver was the smelting of lead ores, a fairly intricate process, which must necessarily be- long to the later stages of metallurgical history. The smelting of ores was not a chance operation, but the logical outgrowth of melting experiments .... Silver and lead are useless metals from the ancient technical point of view. Silver had its value as a medium of cur- rency or for the manufacture of ornaments and trin- kets... . Lead again was a metal entirely wanting in physical properties needed in weapons and imple- ments; it was a worthless constituent of bronze when used as a substitute for tin.... Lead appears late in the history of metals, and apart from some applica- tions in architecture and magic, was not widely used before Roman times.... The connection between silver and moon is common all over the ancient Near East.... Lead plays a very peculiar part in magic. Its dark color and high specific gravity must have led to the superstition that it had chthonic connections. It is also said to be a 'very cold' metal.... It was considered eminently suitable for magical tablets con- taining inscribed curses or prayers for the sick, lead being used for defixions from Assyrian times onwards. ... Native gold alloyed with silver, the ancient elec- trum, formed an ancient source for silver production. ... The ores from which the metal was first produced in larger quantities were no doubt ordinary lead ores and not the rather rare silver ores associated with these lead ores. Prominent amongst the lead ores is galena which is of very common occurrence.... Cerussite and Anglesite have a certain importance as raw materials for the production of lead only.... In Roman and pre-Roman days the only method of pro- ducing silver apart from the gold/silver separation from electrum and the (very unlikely) reduction of silver ores consisted of the treatment of galena in two phases: 1) a combined roasting, reduction and oxida- tion, and this smelting was followed by 2) cupellation. ... Those ores which contained too little silver were smelted for lead only .... " All galena deposits in the Near East and the Mediterranean countries, and the historic data known about them, are discussed, and an attached map shows their location (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 489-524). Zinc and Brass in Antiquity. -R. J. FORBES dis- cusses the above subject in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux, viii, 1949, pp. 747-757. "The history of brass and zinc proves once more that ignorance of the metallic component of an ore did not prevent the ancients from using this ore when manufacturing an alloy .... As brass seems to have been discovered early in the first millennium B.C. there is a difference of more than 2500 years between the manufacture of the copper-zinc alloy, brass, and its metallic constituent, zinc. As the preparation of zinc is intimately connected with the evolution of distillation, which started in the first cen- tury A.D. only, we may safely conclude that zinc was unknown to the ancients.... Brass was, however, certainly produced from the classical period onwards. ... It was always made from calamine and copper. Either the 'earthy' natural calamine or the artificially prepared zinc oxyde or cadmeia (and all its varieties) were used.... If calamine or zinc ore is finely ground and mixed with powdered charcoal and copper em- bedded in this mixture in a furnace or crucible, the zinc formed on heating will alloy with the copper giv- ing it the golden yellow color characteristic of a low zinc brass. It is not even necessary to heat the mix- ture above the melting point of the copper, but even at temperatures of 8000 the zinc will slowly diffuse into the copper to form brass. .... This cementation proc- ess ... is the standard method of brass manufacture in the Roman Imperial Era .... But the process is older than that and its discovery should be sought in Pontus in the beginning of the first millennium B.c. .... Zinc or brass is not found in Egypt before Roman times.... In Iran brass came into use in the Achae- menian period ... Nor is brass common in Meso- potamia and the earliest reference is Sargon II's Khorsabad inscriptions. ... We have here the earliest reference to this alloy in the eighth century B.c. We have a most interesting text in Pseudo-Aristotle (De mirab. ause., cap. 62) referring to the discovery of brass: 'They say that the bronze of the Mossynoeci excells because of its gloss and its extraordinary white- ness. They do not add tin but a special kind of earth, that is smelted with the copper. ... ' This clearly refers to the cementation of copper with 'earthy' cala- mine, which therefore was the original process.... The Mossynoeci were a tribe living in the region south of Trebizond in Pontus where zinc ores abound ..... From this center the manufacture of brass spread west and east but the method was gradually improved.... The first stage was cementation with the crude natu- ral product calamine, the later stage worked with separately refined zinc oxide which was then used to obtain a pure brass. This refinement may be a dis- covery of the Roman period. It was then used all over the world for many centuries .... The spread of brass manufacture to the West was slow. In Greece neither Homer nor Herodotus knows anything of brass.... Brass was quite exceptional in Greece until the Augus- tan Age, if we use the word brass in the true sense (30-38% of zinc, sometimes up to 50%), and do not give it to any copper alloy containing only a few per- cents of zinc. In Rome some Republican coins are</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 295 known to contain up to 4% of zinc but the true brass coinage was issued in the Augustan Age ... Manu- facture of brass on a large scale began in the first cen- tury B.C. and gradually spread.... The production of cadmea as 'Ofenbruch' from the Laurion ore may also date from the later Graeco-Roman period.... The growth of the Cyprian brass industry is of the same date. In the East little progress was made for many centuries as it seems . . . In Persia brass pro- duction seems to have started on a larger scale in the sixth century A.D. when it was exported to India and some two centuries later passed to China.... We do not hear about zinc being made in Persia. This seems to have been done for the first time on an industrial scale in China... somewhere near 1600 ..... Brass is of course known far earlier; references are found in sixth-century texts .... It seems that zinc was pre- pared by Indian chemists from the twelfth century, but this remained a laboratory experiment and never was applied to industrial production.... Brass was of course known far earlier and brass figurines and ornaments became common from the sixth century A.D. onwards. It was from the East that zinc was intro- duced by the Portuguese and Dutch traders in Europe, where zinc manufacture started only in the eighteenth century.... Oreichalkos... certainly means some kind of copper, though it is equally certain that its meaning 'brass' was acquired only in Late Republican times.... In early texts before the first century B.c. one should therefore be careful to translate aurichal- cum or oreichalkos by 'copper alloy' and not by 'brass'.. . . The general Persian term for zinc ores and zinc oxyde is tatiyd, which occurs frequently in mediaeval literature as tutia or totia. ... There is no Persian term which can be identified with zinc. The term roy (zinc) originally meant 'copper'; we find it in the compound term isfid-roy (first 'bronze' then 'brass') which .. was corrupted to spelter or spiauter, the sixteenth-century term for zinc.... Another early European word, occurring, side by side with spelter, is tutenago . . ." Pearls in Antiquity. -Pearls were first mentioned by Theophrastus. They were not known in Egypt be- fore the time of the Ptolemies, though mother-of-pearl was used from predynastic times. Knowledge of them in ancient Babylonia and Assyria is unproved and im- probable. Only the wars of Alexander the Great made them a general article of export to the Mediterranean world (J. BOLMAN, "Pearls in the Near East," in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 525-531). Malta. -In a short report on Malta, in Dutch, re- ferring to the latest literature, H. M. R. LEOPOLD dis- putes the early dating of the megalithic temples and considers them contemporary with and related to the palaces of Crete and Mycenae (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 341-344). Megalithic Monuments. -In AJ. xxv, 1945, pp. 117-124, MARGARET DAVIES discusses the distribution of megalithic monuments of the Irish Sea and the North Channel Coastlands. Her five maps show the distribution of passage graves and forecourt cairns (fig. 5); of secondary and later gallery graves (fig. 6); the interchange of Graig Lwyd axes and Cotswold cairns forms (fig. 7); of single chambers (fig. 8); of stone circles and alignments (fig. 9). Budbury-on-Avon. -The prehistoric site at this place, containing one of the few "sacred circles" in England, is in danger of destruction, owing to the need for housing. ILN. Feb. 16, 1946, gives a plan of the site, and several photographs of excavations recently conducted by GuY UNDERWOOD. These ex- cavations yielded sufficient information to map the site with reasonable accuracy. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age pottery were found. Red Hill, Notts. -In AJ. xxv, 1945, pp. 117-124, C. F. C. HAWKES and PAUL JACOBSTHAL describe an interesting Celtic bird-brooch. The authors conclude that the brooch belongs to the third century B.c. and that it was made in Britain. Originally it had coral in- lay decorations. EGYPT Egyptian Collections. -The illustrated catalogue of the Egyptian Collection in the Gemeentemuseum at The Hague, Netherlands, by C. W. LUNSINGH SCHEULEER, in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 549-557, pls. xv-xx, describes seventy-eight pieces, fourteen of which are reproduced. A. N. ZADORS-JOSEPHUS JITTA publishes a small saucer of dark stone, of a characteristic type, decorated with ornamental designs and, on the inside, with busts of Isis and Sarapis in relief. He considers it a votive gift rather than a patera for actual libations, and dates it, following John Evans, under Julian the Apostate, ibid., pp. 547 f., pl. xIv. W. A. VAN LEER publishes a bronze statuette of a cat in a rare semi-recumbent pose, and a Saitic ushabti of a "Master of the Ward- robe," Hor, son of Uza-shu: ibid. p. 558, pl. xII. W. WESSETZKI reports the opening of an Egyptian Department in the National Hungarian Museum of Fine Arts at Budapest, in 1939, in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 544 f., pl. xI. Foreign Influences in Egypt. -J. JANSSEN assem- bles the results of the more recent literature concern- ing "The Oldest Relations between Egypt and Meso- potamia" in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 319-356. Even one who cannot read Dutch will find the footnotes a very useful guide to the literature. Cer- tain types of pottery, the cylinder seals, the antithetic group of animals with entwined necks, are the chief instances of Mesopotamian influence in early Egypt.</page><page sequence="4">296 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Its main route went through Yemen and the Bab el- Mandeb. The Scarab. -H. C. JELGERSMA'S "Contribution to the Knowledge of the Symbolic Meaning of the Scara- baeus Sacer" points out that many Egyptologists, and even some naturalists, have described inaccu- rately the beetle's characteristic habits of life. It is not so much the rolling of the dung-ball (constituting the food of the beetle) that made it for the Egyptians the outstanding solar symbol of resurrection, but rather its disappearance into the ground together with that ball, and reappearance after a certain time; perhaps also the emergence of the new beetle from a mummy- like chrysalis in a dung-ball (not rolled before) buried in the ground at the end of a deep shaft (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 608-611). Mastaba Reliefs. -An unusual group of two fight- ing boys in the pictures of farm-life among the reliefs of the mastaba of Hetepherakhti in the Leiden Mu- seum is discussed by HERTA TH. MOHR in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 535-551 &amp; 559, &amp; pl. Ix. The hump-backed appearance of one of the boys is ex- plained as due to a correction when chiseling had al- ready begun. Indubitable representations of hump- backs in relief are adduced for comparison. Technique of Egyptian Sculpture.-W. VAN Os discusses, and illustrates with drawings, how the prob- lem of picturing the human torso two-dimensionally was solved in Egyptian and archaic Greek drawing and relief. The typical v- or funnel-shape of the torso is based on actual observation of a model looked upon from the side and turning his shoulder toward the on- looker. The trapezoid or "Iv-shaped" (or, reversed, vI-shaped) form, needed to express actions, derives from combining the standard type with a side-view (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 602-608). Book of the Dead. -Chapter 85 of the Book of the Dead, the "Spell to change into a living soul, in order not to enter in the place of judgment," is translated and commented upon by J. ZANDEE. This spell prom- ises to procure immortality for the deceased through identification with the Sun-god, Re. The commentary points out the numerous expressions belonging to solar mythology and the few references to Osirian jus- tification (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 580-586). Inscriptions. -Two difficult texts with biographi- cal allusions, on temple statues of the xxii dynasty from the Karnak cachette, are translated into Dutch by A. DE BUCK in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 294-304. The first is inscribed on a stele held by the kneeling figure of Nekhtefmut, a priest of Amon (Cairo No. 42208). It was published in 1914 by Legrain, but not translated, and misunderstood in its general meaning. It contains, besides the usual self- appraisal, an invocation of the god to protect the priest's daughter, Tashernmut, against any attempt by his other sons and daughters, to deprive her after his death of her equal share in his inheritance on ac- count of the fact that she already had received a part of his property in exchange for the promise to take care of his old age in her own home. (For a similar agreement see a stele from Amarah, now in the Brook- lyn Museum: JEA. xxiv, 1938, p. 153 and pl. xm, 3.) The fact that it was deemed necessary to perpetuate this agreement so conspicuously, caused De Buck to put a question-mark after the title: "A Happy Fam- ily."-The second text, which covers the cubic statue of another priest of Amon, Nebenteru (Cairo No. 42225), is re-interpreted after a first attempt of Kees, in ZAS. lxxiv, 1938. It sets forth one of the basic prin- ciples of Egyptian philosophy: "Follow your heart!" In an introduction, De Buck translates similar pas- sages from other texts of all periods, which show that for the Egyptians that hedonistic attitude, pessi- mistic about the after-life, -its echo is Eccl. 9:7010 - was compatible with piety and righteousness. Both translations have been made accessible to a wider public through translation into French by Capart in Chronique d'Egypte xx, 1945, pp. 6, 64-69. The texts and headings in Rameses' mu "Calendar of Feasts and Offerings" at Medinet Habu, published in OIC. xviii, partly translated in OIP. xxiii, are translated in Dutch by L. G. LEEUWENBURG in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 327-340. Inscriptions.-A. DE BUCK translates in "The Liquidation of Akhenaten's Work of Reformation" the restoration inscription of Tutankhamfin on the stele Cairo 34183. His interpretations differ sometimes from the last treatment of this text by J. Bennett in JEA. xxv, pp. 8-15. Two passages are singled out for more circumstantial comment. One, "He has inducted as priests children of the notables of their towns," etc., is taken to indicate by contrast that Akhenaten was surrounded mostly by people of low birth, his own creatures. The other concerns the protection and exemption of the temples, and gives occasion to ob- serve how those privileges of the temples were choking the power of the state, and to remark that the trans- gressors threatened in so many royal decrees from the Old Kingdom onward were in the first line state offi- cials acting in the interest of maintaining civil service. Akhenaten's theocracy meant a momentary harmon- izing of the powers of kingship and priestship (Jaar- bericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 569-580). Ethiopian Sarcophagus. -In BMFA. xliii, 1945, pp. 53-57 (8 figs.) Dows DUNHAM publishes an enor- mous granite sarcophagus that has stood for many years in front of the main lecture hall of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It originally contained the re- mains of Aspalta, a king of Ethiopia who died ca. 568 B.c., and weighs about fifteen and a half tons, the</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 297 lid alone weighing four. Owing to poor lighting, its interesting decorations in very low sunk relief can barely be seen. A small scale reproduction has now been placed near the original to serve as an interpreta- tion, and the processes by which it became a faithful rendering of the original are described in detail. The sarcophagus was found in the campaign of 1916, and stood in the innermost of three subterranean chambers under the royal pyramid. The decoration is one of the most complete known, but the content of the inscrip- tions is entirely routine, and traditional, and has been found, in whole or part, in numerous other examples. Like the inscriptions, the figures are conventional and stereotyped, but their execution is of high quality. On the lid is a decoration of the cycle of day and night. In conclusion, the writer points out that "in this sarcophagus we miss the lively human interest which we expect to find in much of Egyptian art." Coptic Bronze Flask. -In News Baltimore Mus. Art, Sept. 1945, pp. 4-6 (fig.) MARVIN C. Ross pub- lishes a flask in the Baltimore Museum. After describ- ing the Copts, and the meaning of the term "Coptic" in art, and the survival of pagan motifs into Christian times, the flask is described. It is eight-sided, cast, and engraved, each side decorated with a lotus petal. There was originally a cover, now lost. The flask is of a type identified by Strzygowski and between his Types Ii and InI, and such vases were considered by him to be for perfume. A date in the late fourth or early fifth centuries A.D. is suggested. The provenance is un- known. MESOPOTAMIA Assyrians in Last Hundred Years. -EDITH Po- RADA, in BMMA. n.s. iv, 1945, pp. 38-48 (11 figs.) dis- cusses the history of the study of Mesopotamian civil- ization since the early nineteenth century. All that was known at the beginning came from the Bible and Greek historians. In 1891, Byron, using Diodorus Siculus as a source, wrote his drama "Sardanapalus," which inspired Delacroix to paint his Death of Sarda- napalus. The first to examine the traditional sites of Babylon and Nineveh was Claudius James Rich, representative of the East India Company at Bagh- dad, in 1820 and thereafter. In 1843, Paul Emile Botta, a French consular agent at Mosul, excavated the mound of Kujunjik (the site of Nineveh) and be- gan the uncovering of the palace of Sargon at Khorsa- bad. Botta's success caused funds to be given to en- able Layard, who had already started work in 1845, to continue his excavations at Nimrud (the Biblical Calah) which proved extraordinarily successful. The writer shows that the spirit of architectural taste of the 1840's asserted itself in the restoration of the pal- aces at Nimrud and Khorsabad, "as if it had been intimately related to the style of the Crystal Palace," The Crimean War stopped the work of Layard and men of his type, and work was then undertaken by language and Bible students, who were interested principally in the texts to be found. In 1812 a German, Grotefend, showed that the cuneiform inscriptions of the Persian kings were written in three languages, and identified a number of the cuneiform signs; using the same method Rawlinson, in 1835, deciphered the fa- mous Behistun inscription. About the middle of the nineteenth century, Ashurbanipal's library was dis- covered at Nineveh, and excavations in Babylonia produced additional masses of tablets. In 1875 lay interest was aroused by the publication of a tablet in the British Museum giving an account of the Deluge. Most of the excavations between 1860 and 1914 were carried out in Babylonia and were reported in scien- tific periodicals or monographs, attracting little popu- lar attention, although the objects found antedated Assyrian art. After the end of the First World War, a fundamental change took place. There was a profound interest in discovering the very beginnings of human civilization. American, English, French and German archaeologists all concentrated on such sites. In Meso- potamia the excavations at Ur are a case in point. When the early Mesopotamian works of art became known and studied, "the Assyrian sculptures slipped into the background." Excavations came to a halt in the Second World War, but present trends of study are briefly discussed, together with the titles of some of the latest books. Sumerian Culture. -P. VAN DER MEER describes "The Al-Obeid Culture and Its Relation to the Uruk and Djemdet Nasr Periods" largely in terms of the Schmidt-Koppers culture-historical method of eth- nology. The population of the Obeid period were Sumerians; they had come from the East and were farmers whose culture originated in a nature-worship- ping matriarchal peasant-culture, with an admixture of a patriarchal magic-totemistic hunter-culture. In the Uruk period, Caucasian invaders from the north- ern mountains, who were sky-worshipping nomadic cattle-breeders, enslaved the peasants and laid the foundations for theocratic kingship and a hierarchical structure of society. The Djemdet Nasr period brought the full development of Sumerian civilization and the invention of writing (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 708-721). Sumerian Sculpture. -F. M. TH. B6HL publishes a fine statuette of a Sumerian priest from KI(hafaje, recently acquired by the Rijksmuseum van Oudhe- den, Leiden, in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 542-544, pl. xxvw. Sumerian Literature. -In a paper on "Image, Fig- urative Language and Comparison in Sumerian," B. A. VAN PROOSDIJ maintains that figurative lan- guage, expressing identification, is more primitive</page><page sequence="6">298 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY than comparison. Allegory, the synthesis of figurative language and comparison, was also used by the Su- merians. In the formation of the system of cuneiform writing, metaphors were constituent (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 661-664). Mesopotamian Sun-worship. -F. M. TH. Bo"HL'S article on "The Sun-God as the Protector of the Indigent" consists chiefly of a new translation with commentary of the long sun-hymn known as "Gray No. 1." In an introduction, Sama', whose cult flourished especially under Hammurabi and his dynasty, is described as the god of justice, jurisdiction, equity and mercy. The sun-religion has a juridic and didactic-moralizing character and represents the hu- manistic-ethical in contrast to the magical-sacra- mental attitude, both of which occurred, however, side by side (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 665-680). Babylonian Plaque. -F. M. TH. BOHL publishes "An Old-Babylonian Plaque with the Representation of a Cultic Dance." It is a small disk of terracotta, of unknown provenance, preserved in the Iraq Museum at Bagdad. The relief shows two over-slender nude fe- males, facing each other, in moderate movement, the hands folded under the breasts. Their hairdress is peculiar. Between them, two bandy-legged dwarfs, standing on pedestals, play the lute; around them, three baboons look on, two crouching, one standing. The piece can be dated, for stylistic reasons, in the late period of the Amurru dynasty, contemporary with the beginning of the Cassite period, that is, between 1750 and 1600 B.C. It is unique and seems to show Egyptian influence (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 725-728, pl. xxv). ASSYRIA Ziggurat Seal. -A representation of a ziggurat on an eighth-seventh century B.C. seal is illustrated by EDITH PORADA in BASOR. 99, 1945, pp. 18-20. It is in four stages, the upper three with vertical walls, con- taining twelve, seven and three recesses respectively; the lower stage is shown with sloping sides. No stair- way is depicted. Two emblems of uncertain signifi- cance (the author suggests they are maces) flank the ziggurat on either side. Above shines a star. PALESTINE AND SYRIA O. T. Chronology. -Recent attempts to solve the vexed problem of pre-exilic Hebrew chronology are re- viewed by W. F. ALBRIGHT in BASOR. 100, pp. 16- SS. Albright believes that the Egyptian system of antedating was used in Israel until 721 B.C., and that the same system prevailed in Judah until the reign of Manasseh (ca. 687-642) when the Assyrian system of post-dating was adopted. A civil calendar beginning in the autumn (Tishri) was probably employed in both Israel and Judah, but the Babylonian calendar with a spring beginning (Nisan) was introduced in the Assyrian period and is employed on the seventh-cen- tury contract tablets found in Palestine. The chrono- logical data for the Israelite kings are shown by Assyrian sources to be more accurate than that for the Judaean kings. This makes it necessary to reduce the number of years assigned to various Judaean kings, resulting in the following dates: Rehoboam (ca. 922-915), Atha- liah (ca. 842-837), Jehoash (ca. 837-800), Amaziah (ca. 800-783), Uzziah (ca. 783-742), Ahaz (ca. 735- 715), and Manasseh (ca. 687-642). The synchronisms in terms of Israelite regnal years are regarded as the later calculations of the editor of the Books of Kings. The fall of Jerusalem is dated in 587 B.c., not 586 B.C. Old Testament Law. -Punishment of "Adultery According to Deuteronomy 22: 22 ff." is based on two different principles. For adultery of a man with a married woman the principle of taking in the act is decisive. It can be traced back through Hittite and Assyrian parallels to an earlier right of the husband to kill such culprits himself. In the case of adultery with a betrothed girl, however, what matters is the formal circumstance if it has taken place inside or outside the town. Nothing is decreed about adultery between a girl and a married man, probably because marriage, with the Israelites as with the other Semitic peoples, was not exclusively monogamous (M. DAVID in Jaar- bericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 650-654). Old Testament Sociology. -J. VAN DER PLOEG writes on "Social Groupings in Ancient Israel. A. Groups of Foreigners. B. The Division into Tribes, Clans, Families." Israel was already a people when it invaded Canaan. Not a fusion with, but a partial as- similation of, the surviving Canaanite population took place. The system of the twelve tribes is very old. They remained throughout the monarchical period not merely geographical terms but distinct social groups. The only political entity, however, was the clan, mispdhiah. Traces of early further divisions and subdivisions, characteristic for nomads, are recog- nizable, but in the sedentary agricultural society of the monarchical period there is merely a number of socially equal clans which formed an upper class be- side common citizens and metics (grtim). The smallest social unity was naturally the family (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 642-650). Jerusalem. -In PEQ., July-October, 1945, J. W. CROWFOOT has an article on "Ophel Again," in which he discusses the excavations made there between 19923 and 1928. Since the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, the broad depression of the Tyropoeon Valley, which once divided Ophel from Zion, has been filled in so completely that it is impossible to see now where Ophel ends and the valley begins. How this filling</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 299 came about was partly revealed in 1927. In one sec- tion the excavators struck the rocky bed of the valley some fifty feet below the surface; there they found ex- tensive remains of the Byzantine and earlier periods, but only two insignificant floors of any later date. In the Arab period, under the Latin kings of Jerusalem, and again under the Ayyubid and Mamluk sultans of Egypt, Ophel appears to have been the site of a fairly affluent quarter of the city. Two major changes took place in the area, the first some time after the foundation of Aelia by Hadrian (135), the second after the Turkish conquest. Each was succeeded by a pe- riod in which levels were relatively constant. Here the story is not one of slow, regular accretions from cen- tury to century, as is the case with tells in the desert. In 1575 a German Protestant doctor named Rauwolff said that inside the city the Tyropoeon was filled up and made even with the top. This number of PEQ. contains eleven pages of plates, with some good pictures of the excavations at Ophel. Palestinian Pottery. -A survey of Palestinian pot- tery, its forms, techniques, and uses, is presented by Messrs. KELSO and J. PALIN THORLEY in the Bibl. Archaeol. viii, No. 4, pp. 82-93, figs. 1-7. With the working out of a complete calendar for Palestinian ceramics it is now possible, on the basis of pottery alone, to date a site within about fifty years, a note- worthy achievement. Tell Umm HamAd. -In BASOR. 100, pp. 7-16, NELSON GLUECIK describes and illustrates the pottery of this Middle Bronze I settlement (ca. 2100-1900 B.C.) discovered by him in the Jordan Valley near the junction of the Jabbok with the Jordan. Its chief char- acteristics are: a brownish-gray or light creamy-gray ware covered with a wash of the latter color, envelope ledge-handles, decoration consisting of a notched or indented band, slightly oblique face-combing, flat bases, and out-turned or flaring rims. Seals. -P. SIMONS studies what he terms, for lack of a more specific designation, "Palestinian Seals," a type much less frequent than scarabs and cylinder seals, which, since it is found mostly in Palestine and shows inscriptions in Old-Hebrew letters only, ap- pears indigenous and typical for that country. In shape these seals, or rather seal-amulets, are usually scaraboids or ellipsoids. Pictorial representations on them show a mixture of Egyptian and Babylonian, very rarely Canaanite, mythological motifs. In the South, where pagan influence was weaker, seals with writing only predominate. The entire group can be dated in the late monarchical period by the similarity of the owners' names with names in the Lachish let- ters and in the Bible (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 683-689). Excavations at Apamea. -The seventh campaign of the excavations at Apamea in Syria was described by H. LACOSTE in L'Antiquitb Classique x, 1941, pp. 115-121, xii pls. The investigations centered around the general plan of the town. A plan is included which shows the crossings of the principal streets (pl. u). Each of these streets is flanked on both sides of the crossing by elaborate colonnades. The chief north- south street is 34.5 m. in width, including the colon- nades, each of which is 7 m. in width. The east-west street, provisionally named by the excavators "the street of the theater," extends 630 m. to the gate of the city in the east, and 600 m. to the theater in the west. It is 19.5 m. in width including the colonnades, each of which is 4.5 m. in width. An inscription in the east portico of the north-south street (near the crossroad) gives the date of 780 in the Seleucid era (A.D. 468), a date which falls between two dates previously settled for this town (i.e. A.D. 391 and A.D. 539). Southwest of the crossing of the streets are the thermae of the town. Attached to the thermae is a peculiar circular palestra with an inner circle of columns and an outer circle of pillars connected by grille work (pl. Iv). Two mosaics were found in buildings connected with the basilica. The smaller (pl. x), which is badly dam- aged, contains the word KaXXos. The larger mosaic (pls. I, Ix) pictures seven bearded philosophers seated in a semi-circle. The central figure is bald and is cap- tioned XoKpairrns. This portrait of Socrates is not a historical likeness, but is an idealized portrait in which the only realistic feature is his baldness. TURKEY Position of Hittite Queens. -With the Hittites, the queen occupied an official position much higher than that of the queens of other peoples of the Ancient East. Her title, Tawannannas, means "Mother of the Divinity." Her office was lifelong; thus often the Tawannannas was the mother, not the wife, of the ruling king. She was regent when the king was a minor, or when he went abroad. She took part in the religious state ceremonies at the side of the king. She was the legitimate queen, though not the only wife of the king, who had a large harem of different ranks; her sons alone had the right of succession to the throne. No princess could become ruler. Marriage of the king was forbidden, but near the end of the Hittite empire, seemingly became allowed. Biograph- ical details are known about three Queens: through Guterbock's publication in 1940 of the royal seals from Bogazkiy, it is now known that the mother of Mursilis In, whom he accused of misrule and banished, was the second wife of Suppiluliuma and named Hinti. Danu-Hepa, the wife of Muwatallias, "perished with her sons" under her step-son Urhi-Tesup. Pudu- Hepa, the wife of Hattusil iz, and mother of his suc-</page><page sequence="8">300 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY cessor, Tudhalias Iv, was politically very influential. (A. A. KAE PMAN, "Tawannannas, the Title of the Hittite Queen," in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 432-449). Yazilikaya. -A. A. KAMPMAN discusses the results of the German excavations at the rock-sanctuary of Yazilikaya. Yazilikaya was the terminus of a proces- sional street. The procession of the images of the gods, led by the king as high-priest, assembled in the Great Temple in the northern part of Hattulas, and ended by returning them to their temples in the southern part of the city. Even after the destruction of the city and the Hittite empire, Yazilikaya remained a religious center for the population. The building of the temples outside the rock-chambers took place in three periods. The northernmost was erected in the fifteenth century B.c., the central one in the fourteenth century, the portico in the south and the additions to the central one in the thirteenth century, near the end of the empire. The great procession of the gods in the main chamber was probably carved in the fifteenth century, that in the side-chamber was extant in the fourteenth century, while the two kings represented there are probably Arnuanda nii (im), the last but one of the Hittite rulers, and his predecessor, Tudhalial Iv. The old ground plan of the side-chamber, made in 1862, has proved inaccurate (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 689-708). IRAN AND INDIA Luristan Bronzes. -The Luristan Bronzes (save a few pieces) were first discovered less than twenty years ago. Because of the region's remoteness, all cemeteries were thoroughly ransacked by the natives before scientific excavations could take place. The tombs show the influence of the megalithic culture. Stylistically there are strong relationships with the ancient Sumerian civilization of Ur (daggers, socketed axe, rein-ring), also with the art of the Hittites and Assyrians, a few with Achaemenid art, more differ- ences than affinities with the Scythian style. "The provisional result of the combined chronological data is then, that perhaps already in the third millennium, but in any case in the course of the second, bronze cast- ing began to be practised, and that a large part of the bronzes must date from the end of the second or the beginning of the first millennium. A number belong possibly in the time of the Achaemenids, but this number is by no means particularly great. Thereafter the century-old art apparently ceases to exist, we cannot guess for what cause." Similar motifs and forms are found in neighboring regions, but also in Europe, chiefly Greece and Italy. Their place of origin, probably the center of the Oriental influence in Europe in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, has yet to be found (ANNA ROES, "The Bronzes of Luristan," in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 477-488). Sogdian Language. -M. J. DRESDEN gives in "Bibliographia Sogdiana Concisa" a sketch of what is known about the Sogdians-an East Iranian people first mentioned by Herodotus and Achaemenian in- scriptions and exterminated by the Mongols -about their country and history, and about their language and literature, discovered in 1904. All publications of texts up to 1941 are listed, and samples of the three kinds of characters used in writing are shown (Jaar- bericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 729-734). Relations of India with Greece. -P. H. L. EG- GERMONT writes in detail on "India and the Hellen- istic Kingdoms. Their Interrelation in the First Cen- tury after the Death of Alexander the Great." India, when unified under the Maurya dynasty (324-231 B.C.) was joined to the Hellenistic kingdoms by com- merce, travel, settling of Greeks in India, diplomatic relations, and cultural interchange, so as to form one society. While the envoys of Seleucus and of Ptolemy In were sent to India to foster trade relations, the aim of Asoka's missions to the Hellenistic rulers was to propagate the Buddhistic idea of Dharma as described in Asoka's rock inscriptions (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 735-746). GREECE General and Miscellaneous Attic skeletons. -In Hesperia xiv, 4, pp. 279-363, J. LAWRENCE ANGEL, with catalogue, plates, and tables of anthropological measurements, discusses "Skeletal Material from Attica." The study is based upon 69 dateable males, 42 females, and 8 children, as compared with 255, 182, and 28 respectively from the rest of mainland Greece. The largest groups of skulls are dated in the Early Helladic, Late Helladic in, Submycenaean, and Classical-Hellenistic periods. The mixed morphological types (Basic White, Classic Mediterranean, Alpine, Nordic-Iranian, Mixed Al- pine, and Dinaric Mediterranean) strikingly confirm C. W. Blegen's hypotheses ("Athens and the Early Age of Greece," in HSCP. Suppl. Vol. I, pp. 1-9; "Preclassical Greece," in Studies in the Arts and Architecture, Univ. of Penn. Bicentennial Conference, 1941, pp. 1-14), concerning the influence of cultural fusion upon the surprisingly strong continuity of cul- ture in Greece. Interesting details include a skull from a marble sarcophagus found between Acharnae and Deceleia and once believed to be that of Sophocles (Cat. 100, p. 308); the evidence for sharp racial dif- ferences between members of one "clan" or kinship group (n. 109, p. 323); the observation that ordinary Athenian and fettered slave skeletons from Phaleron</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 301 show the same racial blend in each group (n. 111, p. 324); the evidence for starvation or plague, possibly connected with Sulla's siege of Athens in 84 B.c., furnished by the bones of about 175 infants found in a Hellenistic well in the Athenian Agora. Angel's con- clusions are: (1) that the evidence for racial continuity in Attica is more remarkable than that for sharp change; (2) that classical Athenian skeletal material does not disagree with the type portrayed in classical sculpture, and tends to confirm it, so far as it can; (3) that it is a process of biological blending, rather than dominance by any single racial type, which pre- cedes the Periclean Age and, as with ourselves, helps to produce a great people and underlies the whole his- tory of civilization; (4) that the skeletal remains con- tribute to medical science the knowledge that many ancient Athenians had arthritis, that where there are fractures, they are well set, and that teeth as a whole are good. In conclusion, the author states that his ma- terial is statistically inadequate, but provides provi- sional ground for positing the fusion of diverse cul- tural and ethnic elements as a key to the understand- ing of the splendid flowering of classical Greek civi- lization. Date of Hellenic Alphabet. -J. PENROSE HAR- LAND, in Studies in Philology xlii, 1945, pp. 413-426, takes up this very controversial subject. As early as the twelfth, if not the thirteenth century B.C., the Phoenicians had been using at Byblos a "proto- alphabet," -so called because it had no signs to represent vowels. This latter the Hellenes invented, thus having the first complete alphabet. The Phoe- nician origin of the Greek alphabet cannot be ques- tioned, for reasons which the writer develops; but the controversy arises as to when this occurred. Dates advocated range from 1400 B.c. to close to 700 B.c. The rest of the article deals with the writer's conclu- sions on this date, which he believes was in the neigh- borhood of 900 B.C., for the Hellenes in the Eastern Mediterranean area (italics his). He sets forth at some length his theory that the original written messages may have been on perishable materials (papyrus, bark, wood, or animals' skins) and hence may have ante- dated the earliest extant inscriptions. He then ana- lyzes the literary evidence in favor of this theory, and states his opinion that, if objection is made to the use of the Iliad in this connection, there really is no "break" in cultural sequence between the Bronze Age and the classical period. This analysis of the literary evidence enables him to arrive at a date as early as the eighth century for the introduction of the alphabet. Next he analyzes the archaeological and epigraphic evidence, and similarly reaches the eighth century for the earliest specimens of writing actually preserved. He does not set much value on the method of comparison of the earliest Hellenic forms with the early Phoenician inscriptions, as widely divergent con- clusions have been reached by scholars working in this manner. At the end of the article he replies to some of the criticisms made against the proponents of the earlier dates, and points out that writing undoubtedly originated among the Hellenes in the eastern part of the Greek world. Dances of Ancient Mariners. -In TAPA. lxxv, 1944, pp. 20-33, LILLIAN B. LAWLER has an article dealing with dances regularly performed by sailors passing Delos, who went ashore for the purpose, to in- sure the safety of their ships. They were probably accompanied by offerings to Brizo (a pre-Greek god- dess, in all probability) for the same purpose. These dances were of remote antiquity, and two or three varieties of dance seem to have been performed. The writer sees Minoan elements in all the known dances at Delos of this order. Other known mariners' dances are also considered. Architecture The Interior of the Hephaisteion. -OSCAR BRO- NEER discusses in Hesperia xiv, 1945, pp. 246-258, two peculiarities of the Hephaisteion supplementary to W. B. Dinsmoor's "Observations on the Hephais- teion," Hesperia, Suppl. v, 1941. The first observation is concerned with a proposed change in the position of the epistyle block, the sole surviving member of the interior colonnade, marked at one end by a square joint with anathyrosis, at the other end by two set- backs. Dinsmoor believed this block was to be as- signed to the southeast corner of the cella of the sec- ond story, where it spanned the distance between the east cella wall, and the first column of the south colon- nade, the square end placed over the column, the other recessed end fitted into the wall. Broneer argues that the block should be turned around, so that the square end is placed toward the wall, and the recessed end over the column. Such a proposed change would affect only slightly the number and spacing of the interior columns, but the anta in the second story, the existence and projection of which can now be deter- mined with accuracy, should be taken into account in the final restoration of the colonnades. A corre- sponding anta has to be restored for the lower story. Broneer's second observation is concerned with the treatment of wall surfaces. The marble blocks were first smoothed and then "stippled with a single point driven in vertical strokes seldom more than .005 m. long," but with an unstippled border of varying width around the edges of each block. Dinsmoor believes that the stippling was a preparation for the effective adherence of stucco which in turn would have been painted. A determining factor in this discussion is</page><page sequence="10">302 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY whether the stippling was executed before or after the blocks were built into the walls. Broneer believes that the stippling was done after the walls were con- structed, that the unstippled borders would have served no purpose as a preparation for stucco, that this treatment of the wall surfaces was part of the decoration and intended to be seen, and that the walls were not intended to receive paintings. A further peculiarity of the walls, which led Dinsmoor to inter- pret evidence that paintings were intended for the cella, is the use of lead in the wall joints which he would regard as a means of waterproofing. But Broneer would regard this feature as part of the system of doweling. W. B. DINSMOOR'S "Notes on the Interior of the Hephaisteion," Ibid. xiv, pp. 364-366, contro- vert Broneer's notes on the same subject; Broneer's restoration of marble crossbeams within the cella is not borne out either by Greek architectural practice elsewhere or by the actual cuttings in the Hepha- isteion itself. Dinsmoor considers, furthermore, that Broneer's arguments concerning the stippled and waterproofed walls "leave us in a purely negative posi- tion," and cites once more the analogy with the cement waterproofing of the spring house in the Amphiareion at Oropos. Sculpture Greek Art at Royal Academy. -ILN. Feb. 16, 1946, pp. 188-189, gives photographs of selected mar- ble and bronze sculpture and statuettes from various English public and private collections, on exhibit at the Royal Academy. Inscriptions Epigrams from Marathon. -In Hesperia xiv, pp. 367-368, ANTONY E. RAUBITSCHEK takes issue with F. Jacoby's interpretation (Hesperia xiv, p. 158, n. 8; pp. 167-168) of two Marathon epigrams. In the first (IG. i2, 609) Jacoby's assumption that the second line was engraved later than the first is not borne out by study of the monument, or even of Kirchner's photo- graphs. Meritt's restoration [EbIXo-gEvos i'roXc]tapxos provides a close link between the two lines of the in- scription. In the second, the author approves Oliver's reconstruction of the monument, reminds Jacoby that the cuttings he refers to as "alleged" are ac- tually there, and conjectures, on the basis of Pausanias i, 32, 3, that the men honored were Plataeans and Athenian slaves. Athens and Halikyai. -Under this title, in TAPA. lxxv, 1944, pp. 10-14 (pl.), ANTONY E. RAUBITSCHEK discusses the fragment, 1G. i2, 20, first published by Ktihler in 1879. He shows that the first two lines of this inscription are really the last two of the decree of which the beginning appears on IG. i2, 19. A tentative restoration of the text is given, and it is shown that the contents of the decree are in full agreement with the other evidence concerning the relationship between Athens and the little Sicilian town of Halikyai. The inscription is dated by the letter-forms in the decade between 435 and 425 B.C. Two Greek Ostraca. -In TAPA. lxxv, 1944, pp. 68-70 (pl.) VERNE B. SCHUMAN publishes two ostraca in his possession, the provenance of which is unknown, acquired when he was a member of the staff of the University of Michigan Near East Research. For each a transliteration, translation and commentary are given. One is part of a land survey list dating in the second half of the second century A.D.; the other, a receipt for the payment of a beer-tax, can be dated from the text only in either 179 or 911 A.D., with the forms of the letters favoring the later date. Numismatics Coins of Asia Minor. -J. JONGKEES discusses in Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux vii, 1940, pp. 429-432, pl. xxiv b, "A Gorgoneion from Western Asia Minor," of the Oriental variety, used for a countermark on a Lydian trite of the reign of Ardys, datable about 635-615 B.c. Gorgo is considered a form of the Ana- tolian Mother-goddess; here she is acting as a mint- goddess. ROME General and Miscellaneous Roman Cemetery under St. Peter's.-The Lon- don Times for February 27, 1946, pp. 5-6, prints a long account, with illustrations, by ENRICO JosI, of the discoveries made while altering the crypts of St. Peter's to enlarge the area for the tombs of the Popes. This work, begun in 1940, almost immediately re- vealed the existence of Roman graves. Archaeologists were called in by the desire of the Pope, and a com- plete Roman cemetery was discovered, with pagan and early Christian graves, dating in the second and third centuries A.D. It was proved that the entire area oc- cupied by the church, and the slope below it, had been a regular burial ground. Previous assumptions as to the site of the circus where St. Peter is said to have suffered martyrdom, have had to be modified. As revealed, the cemetery contains a large number of vaults in parallel rows, separated by a narrow pas- sage. The names of the owners of the vaults are in- scribed. One of the vaults, which is definitely Chris- tian, constitutes the earliest known example of the use of mosaics in Christian funerary art. No trace was found below St. Peter's, either of the Circus of Calig- ula and Nero, or of the Via Cornelia, previously as- sumed to have been in that area. It is now believed</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 303 that these must be sought to the South. The article ends with a list of famous Popes and notable person- ages buried in the crypt. New Discoveries in Holland. -C. W. VOLLGRAFF and A. ROES, in Mededeelingen der Nederlandsche Aklademie van Wetenschappen, Afdeeling Letterkunde, Nieuwe Reeks Deel 5, No. 6, 1942, discuss objects found at Lobith near Herwen, in Bijlandsche Waard. The discovery of a sword of the Late Bronze Age, (with a ricasso,like Sprockhof,pl. 15,9) serves as start- ing point for a review of the famous problem of the sudden spread of Late Bronze Age swords throughout Western Europe. The authors seem inclined to accept the connection of the swords with the expansion of the Celts. In relating Crawford's theory that this movement carried Celtic people from the Alps into England, Vollgraff makes what must have been a very pointed remark in German-occupied Holland of 1942: "this would have been a successful invasion of England by the Swiss." The second part of the article contains a review of objects found at Lobith and a discussion of their bear- ing on the location of the moles Drusi, which the au- thors place near Herwen. Among the objects found are stamps (brick: exercitus Germanicus inferior, a maker's stamp on a bronze vase: cammoi) and inscrip- tions (owners' marks: centurionis Unici Rebili; Cen- turionis Decimi Prisci primi; Aclidicus (sic) Vel. vete- ranus centurio I legionis, probably the same man as the Alcidicus who dedicated the altar published in Ger- mania 1939, p. 31.) Among vases of clay the most inter- esting is a Graufesenque bowl, while among the bronzes two pieces merit special attention. The relief from a silver-inlaid sword sheath showing a warrior in a biga resembles the well-known "Sword of Tibe- rius" in the British Museum. A fine bronze jug of Cam- panian (?) make (pls. 1-2) is adorned with a superb mask of Pan. Sculpture Septimius Severus. -ILN. Dec. 8, 1945, p. 641, publishes photographs of the completely reconstructed bronze statue of Septimius Severus now in the Cyprus Museum. It was originally found in 1928 at Kythrea, thirteen miles east of Nicosia, in fragments. The statue was reconstructed in 1940, and was then re- moved to a place of safety against bombing. It has now been brought back to the Museum. The fig- ure is shown nude, is over life-size, and reveals strong Hellenistic influence. The head is a masterpiece of por- traiture. The Curator of the Cyprus Museum, P. DIHAIOS, writes that this statue "is certainly the most remarkable of all those attributed to Septim- ius." Bronze Statuette of Mercury. -A bronze statu- ette in the Christiaens-Vanderyst collection of the Museum of Tongres, which had already been pub- lished twice without identification, is carefully dis- cussed by P. LAMBRECHTS in L'AntiquitS Classique x, 1941, pp. 71-77, pl. I. It came from a Roman cemetery southeast of the city. The nude, seated figure is 88 mm. in height, with a purse in the right hand, and a bird (probably a cock) in the left hand. The peculiar fea- ture of this statuette is that the ring attached to the head ends at the front in a phallus, that the nose is transformed into a phallus, and that the figure orig- inally was ithyphallic, although the third phallus is now broken. M. Lambrechts interprets the statuette as a representation of the Celtic god, who was assim- ilated under Roman influence to the form of Mercury. It was apparently used as an amulet for protection against harm to the owner while alive, and was then placed in his tomb. The ring was used to suspend the amulet around the neck. He further concludes that the phallic significance is due to Roman influence, and that the statuette was of local manufacture be- cause phallic Mercury was found specifically in north- eastern Gaul, and not in Italy. Figurines from Assche-Kalkoven. -S. J. DE LAET discussed a series of fragmentary terracotta figurines from Assche-Kalkoven in L'AntiquitM Classique xi, 1942, pp. 41-53, 3 pls. Among miscellaneous finds in excavations carried on in 1874-75 was a large number of fragments of terracotta horses. The excavations of those two years and other campaigns, which extended from 1871 to 1877 and which were conducted by P. Crick, gave evidence of a Gallo-Roman town of some importance in the first four centuries A.D. The Crick collection is now in the Archaeological Museum of Alost. The figurines, although there are certain fea- tures in common, were all individually made and fashioned by hand, not from a mold. Some of the horses are harnessed; some are not. All of them are standing on small bases, and in a few cases there are two horses to a base. De Laet, after careful restudy of the figurines, concluded that they were not toys or ornaments, or objects from tombs, but were dedica- tions to some deity, which was either a protector of horses or with whom horses were connected in some special manner. These figurines, then, were ex voto offerings by the inhabitants of the area, representing dedications made for the purpose of gaining protection for this valuable animal. De Laet has added a great many details about the role of the horse in ancient re- ligion, Roman Britain Nazeing, Essex. -In AJ. xxv, 1945, pp. 150-152, M. R. HULL describes three early terra sigillata vessels and two native sub-Belgic copies of continental plat-</page><page sequence="12">304 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY ters, similar to those imported to Camulodunum in the early first century. The vessels seem to have been found together, but the exact site is unknown. Trumpet Fibulae. -In AJ. xxv, 1945, pp. 154-158, E. J. W. HILDYARD partially supports the recent the- ory of C. F. C. Hawkes that the parent of the North England Trumpet brooch was a type introduced from Pannonia by the Ix Legion. Mr. Hildyard shows that a group of these brooches owed its origin to German troops. EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE Coptic Oracle. -H. DE NIE, in "A Coptic-Chris- tian Oracle Question," publishes a pair of small Cop- tic papyri, of the seventh or eighth century A.D., written by a certain Paulus who asks God, in one of them, if he should go to Antinooe, or, in the other, if he should stay in the monastery of Apa Thomas (near Siut). These papyri show for the first time the per- sistence in Coptic Egypt of the traditional Egyptian procedure, known from the New Kingdom, of con- sulting an oracle by putting two slips with contradic- tory questions before the statue of the god. By what means the answer was obtained remains uncertain (Jaarbericht ex Oriente Lux viii, 1942, pp. 615-618). Faience Head of Emperor. -In GBA. xxvii, 1945, pp. 321-326 (4 figs.) MARVIN CHAUNCEY Ross pub- lishes a faience head from Egypt in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore. It represents a man in full face, looking straight ahead, and was originally attached to a bust or figure, of which only traces remain. The head is hollow, and may have been cast in two pieces, and separately from the body, to which it was later unskilfully joined. It is virtually intact; that it is the head of an emperor, is shown by the diadem worn, which is of a type frequently found on imperial por- traits of the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. By a com- parison with Byzantine bronze weights, to which it shows marked similarities, a date in the fifth century A.D. is certain. While the head shows marked resem- blances to a head tentatively assigned to Constantine III, its actual identification must wait until more fifth- century portraits become available for study. MEDIAEVAL Helmets and Armor in Modern Warfare. -In BMMA. n.s. iv, 1945, pp. 5-11 (6 figs.) STEPHEN V. GRANCSAY takes up the contributions that ancient and mediaeval armor made for the protection of the armed forces in the Second World War. "Personal body armor continues to be a vital part of the American soldier's equipment." The helmet used in the First World War had many defects, and the authorities of the Metropolitan Museum were among those con- sulted to improve it; so, just before the end of the war, a type known as 5 A was evolved, but too late for adoption. In the period between the two wars, this helmet was improved, and, as M 1, was the type used by us in this war. The helmets used by the Air Force (M 3 and M 4) were also derived from consulta- tion with the Museum, while late in the war a defini- tive Air Force helmet (M 5) was developed, based on a French helmet of 1527 in the Museum. This is the helmet now in use. Aviators also needed body armor, and the Armor Vest M 6 is based on an Italian brigan- dine, of about 1400 A.D., found in the castle of Chalcis in Euboea, when it was razed by the Greeks, and is therefore probably Venetian. The light weight of mod- ern materials enables the flier also to wear neck armor, which was derived from fifteenth or sixteenth century French models. The writer shows that while the re- quirements of modern armor differ largely from those of ancient, the ancient is useful as a model. The master model, from which all subsequent copies are turned out by machine work, must be made by hand, and the armorer's workshop at the Metropolitan Museum was used to create such master models, and to make de- signs from which in turn the models could be made. The tools used, both in mediaeval times and today, are listed and described. "The Museum's armor gallery is not merely a repository for obsolete military equip- ment." Catalan Champlev4 Enamels. -In The Art Bul- letin xxvii, 1945, pp. 247-259, W. L. IIILDBURGH dis- cusses an article by Marvin Chauncey Ross, "Esmaltes catalanes de los siglos XII-XIII," which appeared in the Archivo espanol de arte 44, 1941, pp. 181-184. Though believing that copper champlev6 enamels were made in Spain from the twelfth or possibly late eleventh century, Hildburgh does not accept the evi- dence produced by Ross as sufficient for a Catalonian origin for the two plaques, which form the covers of a twelfth-century manuscript in the possession of the Tortosa Cathedral, and related material. That they are of Spanish workmanship, there seems no doubt, but it is impossible as yet to associate them definitely with any other established group, or with any particu- lar region. RENAISSANCE Northern Primitives. -CH. S(TERLING), in BMMA. n.s. iv, 1945, opposite p. 49, and cover design, calls attention to two vivid panels, which, combined, portray the Annunciation. Although unsigned, the left panel bears the date 1451. They show marked influence of Rogier van der Weyden, but are not by his hand. Although the artist may have been a pupil of Rogier, there is also strong French feeling, suggesting a link with the school of Amiens. "Their author may be considered one of the most important representatives of fifteenth-century painting in North- ern France."</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 305 Tomb of Gustavus Vasa. -From Sweden it is reported that the tomb of Gustavus Vasa (d. 1560), in the Cathedral at Upsala, has recently been opened, and X-ray examinations of the remains made. Only the skeleton remains, but the grave clothes are well pre- served, and his crown, scepter, and sword were buried with him. His red beard, as shown in all of his por- traits, remains intact. The X-rays reveal that there was deafness in one ear, and that he had an infected jaw at the time of his death (Communication from American Swedish News Exchange, March 13, 1946). New Light on an Old Signature. - Under this title, MURRAY PEASE, in BMMA. n.s. iv, 1945, pp. 1-4 (5 figs.) reports that a Meditation on the Passion in the Metropolitan Museum, previously believed to be by Mantegna, on the not unnatural basis of a signature, has been proved, by the use of infra-red films, to be by Carpaccio. A signature by him appeared directly under the interpolated forged signature of Mantegna, which has now been removed. The Carpaccio signa- ture, however, is visible only by the use of the infra- red light. Seven Madonnas. -The acquisition of a relief of the Madonna and Child by Mino de Fiesole by the Metropolitan Museum in 1942 leads JOHN GOLDSMITH PHILLIPS, in BMMA. n.s. iv, 1945, pp. 18-28 (12 figs.) to study its place in Mino's work. It is the only Ma- donna in America that is unquestionably his, and barring a tondo in Berlin, the only one outside Italy. It is intimately related to six other Madonnas by his hand, all variants of a single theme, and an orderly evolution can be traced among them. All appear to be based on the Madonna del Latte by Antonio Rossel- lino in the church of Santa Croce in Florence. Mino's first variant of this theme is a relief now in the Bar- gello, and parallel illustrations show the striking re- semblance between the two. The second is the relief in the Metropolitan, which was undoubtedly made in Florence, and was therefore done before 1474, when Mino went to Rome to create the tomb of Pope Paul ii. The third variant, which is influenced by the reliefs of Faith and Charity for this tomb, is in the church of the Santi Apostoli at Rome, on the tomb of Cardinal Pietro Riario. The fourth is on the tomb of Cardinal della Rovere, in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo at Rome, while the fifth is now in the Roman Hospital of Santo Spirito. These three were made before 1480, when Mino returned to Florence. The sixth, in the Badia at Florence, was made in 1480 or 1481, while the seventh, now in Berlin, was formerly in Florence, and was one of his last works, as he died in 1484. Finally, the writer takes up a number of works (in- cluding a tondo in the Metropolitan) made under Mino's influence, or other works by Mino himself un- der Rossellino's influence. A new date, in the neighbor- hood of 1470, will have to be given to the Madonna del Latte. An appraisal of Mino's work as a sculptor concludes the article. Bust of Antonio Galli. -In GBA. xxvii, 1945, pp. 257-270 (9 figs.) MARTIN WEINBERGER discusses a bronze bust in the Frick Collection, of a bearded man, with the inscription ANTONIUS GALLUS on the base. Antonio Galli was in his time a well-known figure in the court of Guidobaldo II of Urbino; he was born in 1510, and died in 1561. He was distinguished for the versatility of his talents, being a writer, a soldier, and a diplomat. Comparison with the monument of Anni- bale Caro, carved by Giovannantonio Dosio, which is dated in 1566/7, suggests that the bust of Galli must be at least ten years earlier, but, like the Caro head, it shows the influence of Guglielmo della Porta. It is certainly not the work of a local master of Urbino, but has Florentine and Roman characteristics. The writer sees unmistakable influence of Bandinelli and Sanso- vino, and attributes the bust to Sansovino's pupil, Bartolommeo Ammanati, who came to Rome from Padua in 1550, and was helped by Michelangelo. It is to this period of Ammanati's activity that the Galli bust belongs. It is, as far as is known, Ammanati's only portrait bust, and his earliest work in bronze. On his return to Florence in 1555, he did the statue of Mars in the Uffizi, and the Hercules and Antaeus at Castello, both of which show strong resemblance in detail (treatment of hair and beard) to the Galli bust. A date of 1552/3 is tentatively assigned. Antiochus and Stratonice in Art. -In The Art Bulletin xxvii, 1945, pp. 221-237, WOLFGANG STECHOW discusses representations in painting of the story of Antiochus and Stratonice. The classical legend was re- vived during the Renaissance by Petrarch in his Tri- umph of Love, and, since the early part of the seven- teenth century, it has been a very popular subject, serving as the basis for many novels, plays and opera libretti, as well as paintings. Pictorial renditions of the story by the Stratonice Master, Pietro da Cortona, Andrea Celesti, Sebastiano Ricci, Jan Steen, Gerard de Lairesse, David, West, Januarius Zick, Guillemot and Ingres are described and the variant treatments of the theme analyzed. FAR EAST Archaeological Work in Netherlands India. -In An. Bibl. I. A. xiii, 1938, pp. 27-29, W. F. STUTTER- HEIM presents a survey of the principal archaeological work in Java for the year 1938. This included the ex- cavation of the ruins on a hill south of Prambanan in central Java. These remains date from the eighth to the tenth centuries, as is proved by some inscriptions found in situ. The principal monuments consist of a number of complicated gateways giving access to a now vanished sanctuary. The excavation of the sanctuary of Chandi Djawi</page><page sequence="14">306 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY brought to light an inscription of the year 1353 that may refer to a restoration of this building which served as a shrine for the ashes of King Kritanagara. It was built between 1968 and 1292 and the images found dur- ing the excavations presumably belonged to that pe- riod. The author concludes with a special mention of a great number of terracotta objects from Panataran (East Java) and a number of limestone figurines of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Early Chinese Bronze Masters. -In BMFEA. 16, 1944, pp. 1-24, BERNARD KARLGREN classifies cer- tain Shang bronzes on the basis of inscriptions sug- gesting that they were made by the same artists or came from the same workshops. Although Karlgren finds certain relationships between the groups of bronzes which he had previously designated as style A and style B and the groups of bronzes with identical inscriptions, he concludes: "I fail to see how we can arrive at any definitely proved conclusion.., .when excavation conditions have obliterated all reliable proofs." Dating Chinese Bronzes. -In The Art Bulletin xxvii, 1945, pp. 238-243, OTTO MAENCHEN-HELFEN discusses the criteria for placing Chinese bronzes in chronological order. Maenchen-Helfen believes that "The inscriptions... compel us to keep within a definite chronological framework." He takes exception to the methods propounded by Ludwig Bachhofer in his paper on "The Evolution of Shang and Early Chou Bronzes," ibid. xxvi, 1944, pp. 107-116. In the fol- lowing pages of the current issue (243-246), Bach- hofer offers a rebuttal in support of his views. Site of Chu Chia Chai. -In BMFEA. 17, 1945, pp. 1-64, J. G. ANDERSSON gives an account of excavations at iHsi Ning Hsen (Kansu) in 1923. The author ex- plored a large cemetery consisting of many burial sites from which large quantities of pottery, stone, and bone objects, as well as skeletal remains, were uncovered. There is no question that the site is of the Late Yang Shao era. The article includes a description of all the objects found and twenty-nine plates of illustrations. AMERICA Aleutian Migration Route. -In Geog. Rev. xxxv, 1945, pp. 424-443 (17 figs.) MARIUS BARBEAU (for sketch of author see ibid. pp. 475-476) discusses the route of migration from Siberia or elsewhere to the North American continent. It would be a mistake to see in Bering Strait the only migration route, as it can be shown that successive waves of migration can be traced through the Aleutian Islands. Sea hunters from the East Asiatic coast were driven, often by storms, to the Aleutians, and thence to Alaska. Such observers as Cook and La P~rouse believed that the Aleutians had been peopled from Kamchatka. As an example in point, the writer takes up the migration of the Githaion or Salmon-Eater tribe, which seems to have come from some islands off the Siberian coast, perhaps the Kuriles, to the Queen Charlotte Islands, then into Northern British Columbia and Southern Alaska. According to tribal traditions, this migration required several generations before completion, and four or five changes of language. It is the most recent of many such migrations and can hardly date back "more than a few centuries," as it was not finally completed till historical times. That branch of the tribe that lives on the Southern Alaskan border has a legend of its origin, told on ceremonies, and illustrated on totem poles and carvings, which the writer gives in full. He believes that it can only refer to an Aleutian migration route, and suggests the Kuriles as the prob- able source of the tribe's origin. He also acquired a totem pole, now in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, on which the legend is illustrated; it is the tallest one known from the northwest coast, being 81 feet high. The following data point to the support of his theory: the mention of the double canoe, of a sail made of matting, the presence of the frog, unknown in habitat north of Vancouver Island, and the cormorant, probably the spectacled variety, now extinct, gar- ments made of the fur of the sea-otter, an animal un- known in Bering Strait, but prized in the Kuriles, and the wearing of the labret by some of the characters, which is common to the Aleutians, but absent in the sites of the Old Bering Sea culture. Other features of the story also suggest the same background. The dirge songs sung also seem to come from the Orient - a learned Chinese authority goes so far as to say that a dirge of the Tsimsyan "sounds like a Buddhist chant," and that it "comes from Hindu music." Another dirge, with the refrain "Hayu" astonished this same scholar, as "Hayu" is the Chinese for "Alas." Most of the clans using this chant are descended from the Salmon- Eaters, and may suggest an ultimate Siberian source, as Buddhism has been observed among the Palaeo- Siberian tribes of northeastern Siberia. This unques- tioned Chinese influence will explain a number of archaeological finds in the Nass river region and the Queen Charlotte Islands, such as a Garuda bronze figurine, dating between 1570 and 1770, and a pair of wild boar tusks, which could only have come from Celebes. All this evidence shows an Asiatic source and a migration to the continent via the Aleutians. It is evident also that the original migrants were familiar with the use of metals, and had passed out of the Stone Age. When the first Europeans discovered the country, the Indians knew the art of coldsmithing. On the arrival of the Russians in Alaska, the Tlingit and the Salmon-Eaters adopted the eagle as their totem, or coat of arms, a fact that points to an Eastern derivative. The power and influence of the white man soon became overwhelming, and the dominant figure</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 307 among the Indians at that time was a chief named Stone-Cliff, head of the Tsimsyans, who claimed de- scent from Salmon-Eater. He invited the Hudson's Bay Company to establish itself in his territory, adopting its emblem, the beaver, as his totem. Los Angeles County, California. -E(Dwn~) F. W(ALKER) notes, in The Masterkey xix, 1945, p. 161, that in July, 1945 the Southwest Museum excavated a prehistoric Indian site at the side of Big Tujunga Wash in Los Angeles County. Over twenty-five stone bowls were recovered, with hundreds of other arti- facts. A detailed publication is planned, together with a special exhibition of the finds. Hinchman Collection. -FRANCES E. WATKINS an- nounces, in The Masterkey xix, 1945, pp. 150-153, the acquisition of the Indian collection of the late Fred K. Hinchman, and its subsequent display in the South- west Museum. It is one of the finest extant collections of Navaho and Pueblo arts and crafts, particularly in the field of silver jewelry. There is a group of baskets, in which nearly all the tribes in the Southwest are represented. In addition, there are many objects of the Plains Indians, and a display of pottery. Homer E. Sargent Collection. -This collection, which has been for many years in the Southwest Mu- seum, and part of which has already been described (The Masterkey xii, 1938, p. 918 f.) is further com- mented on by FRANCEs E. WATKINS, ibid. xix, 1945, pp. 156-160. The objects here noted include armor used by the Indians of the Northwest Pacific Coast, from Northern California to Alaska; a group of Tlingit specimens from Alaska; a very unusual collec- tion of Tahltan objects; and a selected group of baskets (Apache, Kaweah, Chilcotin). U.S.S.R. Uzbek S.S.R. -In 1940, during the fourth season of field explorations by the Khwarazymian Archaeo- logical Expedition of the Institute for the History of Material Culture (IIMK) of the Academy of Sciences of U.S.S.R. (S. P. Tolstov, leader), the chronological framework of the investigations was greatly expanded. During the first three years the work of the Expedition was limited, in the main, to the study of the earlier and the Afrigid periods, with only preliminary pros- pecting in the earlier and later periods. During 1940 most of the work was devoted to the study of prehis- toric Khwarazym and to the mediaeval monuments. In addition, the following objectives, in the order of exploration, were covered by the Expedition: (a) To fill in chronological gaps in the sequence of previously discovered monuments so as to obtain a more or less continuous characterization of the evolu- tion of the Khwarazymian material culture. (b) To continue the investigation of the ancient irrigation network of primitive Khwarazym to eluci- date its historical dynamics. (c) To expand the territory of investigation be- yond the boundaries of Upper Khwarazym, which had been sufficiently explored, into Lower Khwarazym, beyond the Sultan-wiz-Dagh and in the area of the delta of the Amu-Darya. The following organizations participated in the work in the 1940 campaign: Historical Faculty of Moscow State University; Archaeological Section of the Institute of the History of Language and Literature of the Uzbek Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.; Central Museum for Local Studies of the Kara-Kalpak A.S.S.R.; The All-Union Academy of Architecture, which was represented by members of the Moscow Architectural Museum and by students of the Moscow Architectural Institute. The Expedition consisted of thirteen members, under the leadership of S. P. Tolstov of IIMK, assisted by IA. G. Guilia- mov of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences. The work of the Expedition continued from July 31-November 4, 1940. The earliest monument studied in 1940 was the Upper Palaeolithic (Kelte-Minar culture) site of Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4, which was discovered during 1939. An area of 200 square meters was uncovered and additional materials were collected from a weathered area of about the same size. This site consisted of one large communal dwelling with clearly defined bound- aries beyond which the number of finds decreased greatly. The outline of this dwelling was roughly oval, formed by a polygon (22 X 16 m.), extending north- northeast to south-southwest. Built entirely above ground upon a framework of poles and beams, it was covered with rushes. The posts (the pits filled with a black ashy mass and coals have been preserved) formed three concentric circles, the outer along the periphery of the polygon, the inner in the shape of a square surrounding the central hearth, and the middle, between the two. Clay was not used. Upon the posts rested the radial beams of the roof, which was covered with a close net of poles. The plan of the fallen roof of the dwelling could be easily traced from the carbonized layers resting upon the main cultural stratum. Charred rushes from the roof were found over the entire area of the dwelling. In the center of the dwelling was a large circular hearth (1.20 m. in diameter), sharply differing in type from the ordinary hearth disposed in several rows along the periphery of the dwelling. The special char- acteristics of this central hearth were the following: (1) Lack of household objects and kitchen remains in its vicinity. These were always very abundant around domestic hearths. (2) A completely different character of ashes. While the domestic hearths contained mainly black and gray ashes and coals, the central hearth con- tained compact pure white ashes, suggesting that the</page><page sequence="16">308 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY fuel had been completely incinerated. (3) Under the central hearth there was found a stratum of sand 0.50 m. deep, which during prolonged heating had become bright red. Similar strata of sand were found under the domestic hearth, but these were usually only 0.5- 9 cm. thick. The excavators concluded that this hearth was used for ritual purposes, and also that perpetual fire had been maintained here for a long time. All the data indicate that this was a perpetually burning fire serving as a religious center. Since the Kelte-Minar culture in general, and the Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4 site in particular, could not be attributed to a period later than the third, or at the very latest, the beginning of the second millennium B.C., Tolstov concluded that in this central hearth we have the earliest monument of fire worship in Central Asia. This becomes particularly important in connec- tion with the important role played by fire worship in Mazdaism, which was the predominating religion of pre-Moslem Central Asia and Iran. The perpetual fire of Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4 is a new argument in favor of Tolstov's frequently underlined thesis regarding the archaic character of the fundamental kernel of Maz- daism, going back to the cults of the primitive com- munity, and of the characteristic traits of this religion (fire worship, dualism, peculiar burial rites, etc.) which distinguish it from other ancient religions. Along the periphery of the dwelling were tocated several rows of domestic hearths or fire platforms. In the excavated portion of the dwelling (144 sq. m.) forty-six such fire platforms were unearthed. The total number of hearths, including the unexcavated and the weathered portions of the dwelling must have been at least one hundred. At the same time it must be kept in mind that the hearths were not all contemporaneous and that some did not exist for a long period. Conse- quently, the location of these fire platforms was fairly frequently changed. It was deduced that the fire plat- forms were originally arranged in two rows: one along the outer wall of the dwelling; another 4-5 m. toward the center of the dwelling. In addition, it was observed that there existed a degree of regularity in the dis- tribution of the hearths within the sectors of the house formed by the radiating rows of posts. The central portion of each such section was usually free from fire platforms. An entire area lying north-northeast from the cen- tral platform was also free from hearths. To judge from the grouping of the fire platforms and the finds, the entrance to the dwelling was in the middle of its short northern side leading through the above-mentioned zone free from hearths. That the entrance was not in the weathered southern portion of the dwelling is clear from the exceptional abundance and even distribution of finds in that section of the site, suggesting a con- tinuous line of fire platforms, around which the finds were invariably associated. The character of the plan of the dwelling indicated the social organization of the Kelte-Minar people. The great number of domestic fire platforms and the very fact of instability, mobility of the hearths (as compared to the stable, structurally designed hearths in the large dwellings of the Tripolje and Ananino cultures, belonging, as well as the great dwellings of the Biskupinskoe settlement, to the last stages of the maternal gens), permit us to assume that the Kelte- Minar culture was characterized by the form of mar- riage, or, at any rate, by a very low stability of the paired family. The Kelte-Minar dwellings, still more archaic than the long houses of the Iroquois, resemble the communal huts of the Mandans, the Bikaizis and, especially, the communal huts of'the Andaman Island- ers, with which it has in common not only the round plan of the dwelling, but also the presence of the per- petual communal fire and the distribution of the dom- estic fires around it. The number of the inhabitants of the Kelte-Mina- rian dwellings must have been relatively large. The Mandan dwellings, averaging 11 m. in diameter (about 96 sq. m.) hold 80-40 inhabitants, 2.4-3.9 sq. m. per inhabitant; Andaman houses, 14 m. in diameter (about 154 sq. m.) hold up to 100 inhabitants each, or 1.5 m. space per inhabitant. The great Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4 house, having a floor area of 280 sq. meters, must have been inhabited by 100- 125 individuals. It is possible to attempt a reconstruction of the Kelte-Minar dwelling both on the basis of the finds and by comparing it with the structurally similar dwellings of contemporary primitive peoples. By com- parison with such dwellings, the height of the Dzhan- bas-Kala dwelling should be determined as being ap- proximately 8-10 meters. The most common relation of height to the diameter of round dwellings of primi- tive peoples, e.g., Andaman Islanders, etc., is 1: 2, i.e. the slope of the roof is approximately 450. Such a con- struction is the most rational solution of the struc- tural problem, giving: (1) Optimum distribution of weight in two directions: vertical on the posts; oblique along the slope of the roof; (2) The slope of the roof is sufficiently great to facilitate the shedding of snow and rain, and not too steep to cause the slipping of the roofing. Poplars, one of the principal trees of this area of the Amu, were well adapted for use for the high posts of the building. The finds at this site supplement the data obtained during the 1939 excavations and permit several new historico-cultural conclusions to be drawn. Many frag- ments of pottery show the combination of stamped ornament with red painted surface which support Tolstov's contentions that in the Kelte-Minar cul- ture the dominating cultural stream, related to the</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 309 Siberian Neolithic and with the "Steppe Bronze," was combined with the strong influence of the pottery of early Anau type. The oval plan of the Kelte-Minar dwelling is also important. Ethnographical observa- tions indicate that the oval dwellings usually originate in the zones of contact between peoples inhabiting rectangular dwellings and those using round struc- tures. Thus, in South America oval houses are found among the Arawaks -Yamanii and among the Kar- aiks -Bacairi, tribes inhabiting north of the zone of rectangular "maloc" (?) dwellings and south of the zone of the hemispherical dwellings (Mato Grasso and Brazilian uplands tribes). In Africa the oval type is encountered among the Mangbettu living on the frontier between the Sudan, where the round plan predominates, and the Congo Basin, where rectangu- lar structures are more common. From a study of the construction, and particularly the presence of a central hearth surrounded by a sys- tem of posts supporting the central portion of the roof, it appears that the ancestral form of the oval Kelte-Minar dwelling was the round dwelling with characteristically constructed roof with a central open- ing. Like the Kelte-Minarian pottery, this type of dwelling was subjected to the influence of the rec- tangular dwelling connected with the culture of the Anau cycle. The pottery varies greatly in form and ornament. In addition to the many ornamented vessels of the type described in 1939, there were found fragments of vessels, separate zones of which were covered with curvilinear ornament formed by intersecting arcs of the circle impressed by means of a sickle-shaped stamp. Most of these fragments were found 300 meters south of Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4, on the site of a completely destroyed analogous dwelling, Dzhanbas- Kala No. 5. Of particular interest were the newly-dis- covered boat-shaped vessels with thin walls, resem- bling in shape an egg dissected along the horizontal axis. One such vessel, once painted red, was deco- rated along the edge with a broad band of hatched ornament divided by the vertical lines of the ornament into rectangular ornamental fields. Together with the boat-shaped vessels, there were also smaller oval cups, of somewhat angular outline, unornamented or slightly ornamented. One of these cups has at its nar- row end two conical protrusions, forming a handle, reminiscent of the twin protrusions on some of the anthropomorphic pots from Tepe Hissar in Iran, and the Central European Neolithic, where it symbolizes human breasts. Vessels of this type, dedicated to Harsagkalemma (the Earth Goddess), were also ex- cavated at Kish in Iraq. While the boat-shaped ves- sels stand alone among the known ceramic forms of Soviet Neolithic and Bronze periods, the angular-oval cups have some parallels among the Uralian Bronze Age pottery of the second millennium B.c., which is reminiscent of the Kelte-Minarian vessel forms. Nu- merous fragments were found of large vessels covered solidly with "fir tree" ornament, with parallels in the Afanasevo culture, in the Trans-Uralian cultures of Shighir type, and a particularly close parallel in the pottery of eastern Turkestan collected by Sir Aurel Stein together with microlithic flint inventories, also closely related in type to the Kelte-Minar implements in the sands of the Yarkend-Darya Basin, forty-five kilometers from the river, and the mouth of the Kuruk-Darya. It is now possible to determine more closely than heretofore the cycle of historico-cultural relations of the Kelte-Minar culture. It emerges as one of the late Neolithic cultures with microlithic tradition, with an area of distribution extending from the Aral Sea to Sinkiang. This is apparently historically more or less connected with contemporaneous cultures in the Gobi area. The sphere of influence of the Kelte-Minarian ele- ments extends north as far as the mouths of the Ob River, and it can now be claimed with sufficient cer- tainty that the early complexes of the Shighir cycle of cultures were formed under a strong influence of Neo- lithic cultures of the Aral basin. A strong influence of the Neolithic cultures of the Kelte-Minarian cycle (in the widest sense of the word) is also apparent in the southern Siberian Neolithic, where it becomes assimilated with the local macrolithic tradition and survives in the Afanasevo culture, which had also possibly absorbed additional influences of later derivatives of the Kelte-Minarian culture. To the south the area of this culture goes beyond the frontiers of Central Asia, and includes northern India down to the Vindhya Hills in the south and Burma in the north. Unfortunately, the pottery of these areas has not been completely studied; it is, however, definitely in the cycle of primitive pottery with stamped ornament. In this connection there should be mentioned the fre- quently described connections between the tongues of pre-Aryan India (Dravidian and Munda) and the Finno-Ugrian languages, and particularly the Ugrian languages of northern Eurasia. Since the ethnographic map of the intervening areas for the periods after the beginning of the first millen- nium B.c. is sufficiently well known to exclude the possibility of any connection between the Finno- Ugrians and the Munda and Dravidians through the intervening wedge of the Indo-Iranian peoples, the historical roots of these connections must be found only in the earliest periods. Tolstov thinks that the second millennium B.c., in the course of which the ethno-cultural unity of the Eurasian steppes from the Don to the Minussinsk area became crystallized, char-</page><page sequence="18">310 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY acterized by the stable complex of the Srubno-Andro- novo culture, which finds no cultural parallels south of the Central Asian steppes, should also be excluded. On the other hand, the fact that the Upper Palaeo- lithic cultures of the extensive territory between north- ern India and the mouth of the Ob River in Siberia have so much in common, seems to suggest that the Upper Palaeolithic period was decisive for the process of emergence of Indo-Ugrian parallels, and that the Aral Sea area was one of the most important links. As a matter of fact, the line drawn from the mouth of the Indus through Lake Ilamun, along Gerirud and along Irits, Turgai, and, possibly the Emba in Trans- Uralia, is the straightest and the most accessible route for Indo-Uralian relations. The only argument against the accessibility of this route, the presence of many deserts, can now be overruled through the dis- covery of the rich water supply of this area, which extended to the zones of the neighboring rivers during the pre-agricultural period. Apparently this line, and not the difficult mountain passes of Hindu-Kush and the Pamirs, was the most important axis for the processes of ethno-cultural con- solidation of the ancient tribes of India, Iran, Central Asia and eastern Europe. These processes were re- sponsible for the appearance of common traits in the languages of pre-Aryan India and pre-Indo-European eastern Europe, and, later on, for the ethnographical formation of the eastern group of the Indo-Europeans. The exceptionally rich flint inventories from this site were further enriched in 1940. Together with white and brown flint of excellent quality, many implements of various varieties of jasper (yashma) have been found. The inventories included microlithic blades, scrapers, burins, long scrapers, perforators, arrow- heads worked on one side and made out of laminae, flint points with biface flat retouching, the later type typical for the Uralian and Siberian Neolithic. Some larger crude retouched knife-like laminae were also found, as welJ as polished flat slate knives with rounded working edges. It is unfortunately im- possible to determine the form of the few fragmentary large polished greenstone implements [axes?]; what- ever the case, these were not perforated axes. Bone implements were mainly represented by many long cylindrical-conical arrowpoints, sometimes slightly grooved horizontally, and two large bone implements requiring extensive reconstruction, but, apparently, foundations for implements with inserts. Many flat, polished sandstone tablets were found around the hearths, together with a quantity of yellow and red paint. Ornaments were abundantly represented by beads and pendants of shells, colored stones, and bird bones. Cylindrical shell and perforated bone beads predominated, together with oval beads, perforated from one end, flat stone and bone pendants, flat half- shells perforated near the periphery, etc. Of great interest were the details connected with the location of the cultural stratum. This dwelling was located upon a sand dune, upon the stamped down summit of a sandhill (barikhan) facing with its steep concave side to the north. After the dwelling was de- stroyed by fire and abandoned, it was covered by sand forming several hillocks concave toward the north during the occupation of the other similar dwellings nearby. The relief of those hillocks had been pre- served by the thin clayey crust formed over them during a flood from nearby lakes, which had appar- ently occurred about the beginning of the first century B.c. The concatenation of these data suggests that during the third-second millennia B.c. the wind direc- tion of this area was the exact opposite of the present. Since the prevalent northwestern winds of today are determined to a large degree by the extensive area of the Aral Sea, it is probable that during the earlier pe- riod the regimen of the Aral Sea differed greatly from that of today, the Sea being then either much smaller or having consisted of a series of large lakes and marshes in the area of the joint delta of Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya. Much new information has also been secured relat- ing to the later stages of Khwarazymian history. To the northeast of Angka-Kala, Tolstov discovered a badly weathered site of the Bronze Age (Taza-bagh- yab culture) yielding some excellent specimens of the richly ornamented flat-bottomed ware. It is now pos- sible to establish the sequence of the Kelte-Minar, the Taza-bagh-yab and the Amirabad cultures, the middle of the three cultures preserving, together with new elements suggesting the Srubnaia and Andronovo cul- tures, many peculiarities of the Kelte-Minar ornamen- tation, and at the same time having the protrusion on the side of the base typical of the Amirabad culture. This latter culture was richly represented in the finds. Many new sites of this culture were discovered in the sandhill area northeast of Nariadzhan, between the ruins of Kosh-Parsan and Yakke-Parsan. A continuous string of sites was found along the southern edge of the depression to the north of the Dzhanbas-Kala prominence, a few kilometers to the east of Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4. Analogous sites were also discovered along the great canal south of Bazar- Kala. Of particular interest are the two sites dis- covered by Guliamov, Dzhanbas-Kala No. 6, in which was found an untouched cultural stratum of the Amirabad culture, and Dzhanbas-Kala No. 7, con- taining the well-preserved remains of a dwelling of that period. The rectangular clay dwellings of the Amirabad pe- riod, which the excavators attributed to the eighth-</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 811 seventh centuries B.C., still completely retained the character of communal houses. The "Great House" of Dzhanbas-Kala No. 7, parallels the slope of the prominence to the south on the depression, and, like the Dzhanbas-Kala No. 4 dwelling, was built upon a sand dune. This dwelling was 77.0 m. long and 20.0 m. wide, with walls 1.5-2.0 meters thick. An interior wall divided the dwelling into two parallel corridor- like apartments, 5 and 10 meters wide. This type of "Great House" is generically connected with the Kizeligyr Gorodishche discovered by the 1939 Expedi- tion at Chermen Yabe. This latter was the most an- cient type of gorodishche with "dwelling-wall." On the basis of the pottery (wheel-made with horizontally- notched surface), reminiscent of Achaemenid metal vessels and vessels depicted on Achaemenid bas-reliefs, as well as Anau III pottery, associated with many Scythian arrowheads of a relatively early type, the Kizeligyr Gorodishche was attributed to the Achae- menid period, fifth-fourth, or possibly, sixth-third centuries B.C. It is signifidant that during the excavations of the Amirabadian sites near Narindzhan, conducted jointly with Guliamov, late Amirabadian pottery was found in association with a few forms typical of the culture of "Gorodishches with dwelling-walls" (rims of pots straight and tall, outer surface of rim protruding be- yond the walls of the pot in such a way that the transi- tion from the rim to the wall forms a rectangular chan- nel). This furnishes us with a direct transition from the Amirabad culture to the highly developed culture of "gorodishches with dwelling-walls" which, in its turn, is connected through its pottery with the "Kanguy culture" of the third century B.c.-first century A.D. In this way the excavators have suc- ceeded in tracing a continuous chain of monuments from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period. Siberia.-An Expedition from the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. and the Arctic Scientific Re- search Institute, under the leadership of S. Rudenko, excavated fourteen sites on the Chukotsk Peninsula from Krest Straits in the south to Cape Dezhnev and Wellen in the north. According to this report, dated November 28, 1945, some 2000 objects were found, including stone weapons, bone objects, mainly walrus teeth, whalebone and pottery. Of especial interest were arrowheads, harpoons, bone handles for stone knives and other ornamented objects. The results ob- tained confirm the theory that Eskimo culture spread across the Bering Strait into Alaska. The collection is now being studied in Leningrad. Hermitage Museum. -On June 30 and on July 20, 1941, more than 1,000,000 objects were removed for safety to Sverdlovsk. On November 14, 1945, the Academician Orbeli, who had remained in Leningrad, reopened the Museum. When we visited the Hermit- age on July 1, 1945, while guests of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. to attend the Jubilee Session commemorating the 220th Anniversary of the found- ing of the Academy by Peter the Great, we found only a temporary war-time exhibit. The building had suffered relative7y little from bombing and long-range artillery. 1940-1945. -Work was delayed by World War II but early in the fall of 1945 Tolstov returned to Khwarazym and continued his archeological survey of the Kizil-Kum Desert. A general plan for archeo- logical research throughout the Soviet Union is now in effect.</page></plain_text>
