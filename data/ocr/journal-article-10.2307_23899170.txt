<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILFRED CANTWELL SMITH Thoughts on Transcendence* My topic is Transcendence, as announced. My thesis is that there have been throughout history and across the world a général human aware ness of transcendence; and a général human propensity to perceive it, and to express and to nurture the awareness of it, in and through specific forms. One such form has been, for example, the concept of immortality. There have been and continue to be many more. Before I turn to some of the others, and to the larger matter, a brief comment on the concept "life after death" in particular, which has been, and for many is today, a matter of enormous seriousness. I recognize this, and respect it. I recog nize also that it can be taken, has been taken, either as a metaphor, or literally. Let me State at the outsed that I personally do not believe in it literally. Also, I do not myself use it metaphorically. Probably I should at once add that I am not at all afraid of dying, which I shall be doing one of these days - as will all of you, just as surely although perhaps not so soon as I. Moreover, I never have been afraid of death — my own death - since the age of seven-and-a-half; though it was a decade or so after that before I moved well beyond the idea of life-after-death. In contradistinction from "life after death", the phrase "eternal life" I do not reject. On the contrary, I am rather fond of it; though I do not use it much, either, since I find that other people may understand it to mean something différent from what it richly means to me. It has been said that eternal life is not, in relation to life on earth, a continuation in linear sequence; that rather, eternal life is with us every moment, at right angles to life on earth. I find that illuminating, recognizing that eternity intersects our immédiate existence and we live from day to day in an ad ded dimension. Yet it too is a metaphor, as is talk of something after death, "after" being a concept relevant to this world, of space and time. The "right-an gles" metaphor, however, is probably less prone to being taken literally, the besetting danger with all talk about what is transcendent. And I cer tainly could not improve on the définition given long ago in the Gospel: "This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent" [John 17:3] — though nowadays one * Paper read as "The Xngersoll Lecture" at Harvard Devinity School, March 10, 1988 (Original Title: "Transcendence").

This is an opération inter estingly comparable to, and interestingly différent from, the translation that has already been effected for us, in translating it out of Aramaic or more probably Greek into English. Translations among languages are teasing enough; translating among world views is a more recent chal lenge, one similar in principle, though even more challenging. I myself would speak of "counterpart" rather than "équivalent" in both cases. What I mean by the Western phrase "eternal life" is found among Buddhists, Jews, and others in the same measure as among Christians, although they formulate it in words and concepts and images differ ently. "Transcendence" as a Conception Let us turn, then, to transcendence as a général matter. As a term, one might say that I am calling on it in order to refer to something that has had many and diverse human expressions, in quite varied words, con cepts, images, forms. I should like to try to talk about it, however, not as a term, but as something to which in my usage — my maybe idiosyncratic usage — the term refers. Therein lies the difficulty. For the notion "tran scendence" has as its very point the récognition that the reality to which it endeavours to refer transcends our appréhension of it. "Transcend" is cognate with "ascend" and "descend", and means literally to go above and beyond. For me, at least, the notion of "going" is integral, and along with that dynamic, the above-and-beyond implication is what the word serves to point to - and even to dénoté. It has become one of my favourite terms — as any of you know who may have read things that I have been writing — and also one that rea ders have found one of my least clear. Discourse among human beings dépends on our having, or being able to arrive at, shared meanings for the words that we utter. People have more than once asked me what I mean by "transcendence", and in a way my agreeing to give this lecture signifies that I am fïnally endeavouring to clarify the matter. Tran scendence is mystery, however, to use another term (one that Professor Kaufmann has been developing richly of late); and the point of mystery, similarly, is that it is not to be clarified yet is to be explored. Transcendence is not to be comprehended though it is to be appre hended. As Juang dzu put it, "I know how to get to [its stupendous spaces]; but I do not know where they end".1 When someone asks me, then, to say what I mean by "transcen dence", I know that they have misunderstood my basic intent. A recent 1 Arthur Walcy's translation, in his Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, [1939] 1984), p. 79.</page><page sequence="3">34 Wilfred Cantwell Smith critic has written that my notion of transcendence is ambiguous; my answer is, "Of course: it is intended to be". I mean by "transcendence" not what it means to me; that is in principle far too limited, too finite - though I should like to think that my awareness of it approximates, however distantly; is more or less on the right track, is pointing in the more or less right direction. Nor is transcendence even simply the sum of the best of what Augustine and Aquinas and John Wesley and the home in which I was brought up meant by God; Lao dzu, by Tao; Gau tama by dharma and nirvana and other words, and by his enigmatic silence, or his serene smile; the Bhagavata Purana, by Radha, or the Goddess with a capital G; the Greeks, by beauty, truth, and justice; classical philosophers by Reason (attested in the firm grounds of our spelling that with a capital R) . . . and so on; and also more modern things, from Galileo, and Einstein, and Silicon Valley; . . . and everyday things. My purpose in offering an address of this sort is not to teil what I mean by "transcendence", but rather to proffer some suggestions, I shall hope perhaps helpful, as to what you, in this audience, and what my readers, if this lecture should turn out to be deemed worth publishing, and I, may come to mean by it, if you and they and we begin to think about it in perhaps new ways, and look about us with more widely op ened eyes and more sensitive responsiveness; what any of us may come to recognize with gradually increasing clarity if we push on to attain enhanced inner integrity and moral discipline, and greater compassion and love for those around us, and more intellectual insight. I would not have agreed to give this lecture if I had feit that all that I could do would be to teil you about my sense of what transcendence is. I am too unimportant, too finite, too particular, to make that of more than passing, trivial, interest. The point of a présentation of this sort is rather what possibility it may offer, of suggesting where one may perhaps look to see for oneself facets of the transcendence in which we are all imbedded, and our world is. If there be arguments in what fol lows, they will be offered in the hopes that they might perhaps help to free some from whatever dogmatic préjudices of our modern culture make it normal not to look for the kind of truth and reality that most of our fellow humans throughout history and around the world have found, and have reported to be more precious, more rewarding, more real, than anything eise that they have encountered on earth. Transcendence as universal and as personal - illustrative instances As I say, many of my friends have asked me about the transcendence of which I repeatedly speak, and about the concept in my mind that lies behind my use of the term. Although finally I am in a sense now re sponding to such requests, yet equally significant is that despite my fondness for the notion this is the first paper that I have attempted di rectly on it, after nigh on fifty years of teaching and writing. The reason</page><page sequence="4">Thoughts on Transcendence 35 is that I have not wished to write books nor articles about transcendence as an idea. Rather, I have studied and written about the world around us, and about the people who inhabit it and have built its civilizations. I have studied and written in the hopes of understanding these and then of contributing something towards enabling those who might read my books to see both the concrète détails and the transcendence to which - my studies have increasingly led me to discover (often to my startled surprise) - that world and those people have pointed. From Islam in Modern Historj to F ait h and Belief, just as my work has never been "about" transcendence, explicitly, so also it has always been so im plicitly. For a long time, I did not myself realize this. All that I was conscious of was that my scholarship was a study of persons. This focus gradually led to the larger implications. For the personal implies the transcendent. And of course the word itself is neither here nor there. I could equally well say "God", except that I find that many of those to whom I speak and for whom I write are not theists, and / or they believe that that word dénotés a particular concept, rather than connoting a reality that in prin ciple cannot be denoted; a reality that is, to use my vocabulary, transcen dent. If any of you has a better word to communicate that reality, good. With this particular word, though I myself have not thought of a better, there are diffkulties, to be sure; I am aware of that. Two among them - both massive - are its seeming to many too vague, and its seeming to many too definite. One example of the latter is that several think in terms of transcendence as contrasted with immanence, whereas for me they are two facets of the same diamond. Harvard University transcends Harvard College, but is immanent within it. (The next step is: for "but", read "and".) The English language transcends every English sentence, and is immanent within it. The Community of which any individual is a member transcends each of its members, and to varying degrees is im manent within each. The long process of history in which we par ticipate, and which participâtes in us, transcends us and our Century, while being immanent within us and it. The beauty of which a particular sunset may be an instance, less or more magnificent in our eyes and souls, transcends that instance, in the very act of being immanent within it. We participate in God; He/She/It participâtes in us; yet as the Muslims say, huwâ td 'alld". Not only does Harvard University transcend Harvard College; fur ther, the soul and spirit of university - the elusive yet magnetic meaning and idea of truly being a university - transcends Harvard and all extant universities and is decisively immanent within them; in some more than, alas, in others; and in any, more at one moment than, alas, at another. I spoke above of the inherent significance of "transcendence" as going above and beyond; this is quite différent from simply being above and beyond. To understand the word in the latter sense, as if it referred to something both static and far off, betrays the term itself - which, after all, is formed from the présent participle of a verb, with all three of the</page><page sequence="5">36 Wilfred Cantwell Smith presentness, the participleness, and the verbal quality being important. To maintain this in modern English among those that have lost touch with Originals and basic meanings, it might be better to speak rather of "transcendingness". (This would help, also, in making qui te clear that I am not using the term in certain ways developed recently by some phil osophers.) This matter of movement is crucial; as is the point that it is human beings that move. Central to an understanding of the universe, of humanity, and of transcendence itself as a principle, is that the three are interrelated, intimately — and dynamically. Characteristic of transcen dence is its process quality, and its involvement of us in its process. Characteristic of the universe is that it keeps transcending us — us and our grasp, though not entirely. Characteristic of us is that we are self transcending, especially as we move through time, and that our aware ness of the universe, of reality, of truth, though always partial, can, if we take proper steps, be less partial today than it was yesterday, less partial tomorrow than it is today. Less distributively, one might say that transcendence, in my sense of the term, is characteristic, actively, of human beings as such, and of the interrelation between the universe and us. Modern philosophy has devoted much attention to epistemology, the question of how we know. More germane, as well as more trenchant and also more serviceable, is the dynamic question: how we learn. It is not so important to know much, as actively to recognize that we can know more. Many of you, many of my readers, doubtless will not resonate to the particular English term to which I have gravitated. My vocabulary is of no great significance; and may be of no great help. Certainly my théories, if one is to call them that, are to be judged not as théories but in the light of what they are théories of; what they endeavour to illuminate: namely, the world and our life. The question is not whether you agree with what I say, and certainly not with the imperfect way that I am saying it; rather, whether you see some of the things that I see and am trying to point to and am offering a vocabulary to talk about and whether you see other things of this ilk that I have not seen, and can point them out to me. And finally, of course, the question is whether those things that various ones of us have seen are indeed there. The purpose is that we may all live enriched; and that at the intellectual level we may once again think about, and talk to each other about, the richness to which our human life has access. That richness is greater than any of us has yet grasped - which again is why I find the term "transcendent" apt. The remainder of my address will try to clarify what I am calling transcendence by dint of comment on what is happening, and on how, I suggest, we may be helped to understand it. After all, I am an historian, and only reluctantly a theorist; and am interested in théories only in so far as they grow out of and illuminate what we observe of the world and our life within it. Our life within the world is simultaneously also</page><page sequence="6">Thoughts on Transcendence 37 "above and beyond" it, transcending it. That is an empirical historical observation. Yet formulated in that fashion, it requires some elucida tion. I have said that if we were all theists living in a theistic culture, one could use the word "God" interchangeably with "transcendence". Since, however, even theists among us live in a powerfully secularized culture which has de-transcendentalized even the words we use, even for many the word "God", I do not pursue that line. I could also talk about "re ligion" or the "religious"; and being an historian of religion I might be expected to do that. It is true that my study of the religious life of the great majority of humankind and my own religious upbringing loom large in what has helped me to hammer out the ideas that I have, as ex planations of the data that I learn. Yet this is the West; and here we are in the twentieth Century. Although I shall return to touching on what the modern West calls religion, yet I shall today focus on the secular side of our culture. (By the way, one may notice that the modern West has coined the phrase "religion and culture". For other civilizations, and for our own in other centuries, one must at most think rather in terms of "religion and the rest of culture".) Some of you know that I have advanced the thesis that the West is bi cultural, having received one major stream of its inheritance from Greece and Rome, one from Palestine. It has developed the unusual concept "religion" to characterize one of these, and tended to leave the other unidentified, except by contrasting it, or various component él éments of it, to "religion": elements such as philosophy, law, the State, and so on - and "culture", as just noted. Lately, the notion "secular" has become standard, thought to mean basically "distinct from religion", though understood as "distinct from our héritage from Palestine". The elements that I have mentioned are not so distinct from religious matters in the worlds's other civilizations; each of philosophy, law, the State, etc., are inside the so-called religious complex of various peoples. For the West and its history, I have insisted on discriminating between what I call "positive secularism" and "negative secularism". These in gross terms are two successive stages in the évolution of this stream, the nega tive phase being relatively recent but by now virtually prédominant. The différence between the two is essentially the presence or absence of a sense of transcendence. By "positive" I refer to the récognition in this secularism of cosmic realities higher than we, and the nurturing of al legiance to them. By "negative secularism" I designate the outlook or ambience that has lost effective conscious touch with those realities. The transition in Western so-called "secularism" from the one phase to the other is one of the most profound developments of the modern world. My thought is that if I can succeed in using this shift to illustrate my thesis, I may succed in suggesting the reference for the term "transcen dence". It becomes one more instance of our recognizing the sig nificance of something only after we wake up to realizing that we have lost it. Our society is deeply aware that we have lost something; my</page><page sequence="7">38 Wilfred Cantwell Smith argument or suggestion will be that transcendence is what we have let slip dolefully out of sight. When I speak of the Graeco-Roman inheritance in our Western civi lization as a spiritual stream, calling it the tradition of "positive" secularism and seeing it as transcendence-oriented, I am thinking, for in stance, of its sense of Beauty, Truth, and Goodness. Not only has the idea of beauty — idea both in the Piatonic and in our modern sense — been consequentially powerful in our history and our lives; but also the often unarticulated role played in our lives and our history by the actual ity of such beauty, in innumerable instances, has been powerful. Of the visual arts I leave others to speak. In the case of music, I may mention inadvertent testimony to what I call its transcendence from even twentieth-century practitioners. Pablo Casais speaks of the unac companied 'cello pieces of Bach in terms of "miracle ... To strip hu man nature to the point of giving it divine contours, putting into such activities as are most readily within human reach spiritual fervor, giving to the most ephemeral nature wings of eternity, rendering human things divine and divine things human - that is Bach. . ,"2. Stravinsky once spoke of faith to name his sense of what involvement in music means. I have heard my own remark re-quoted that one may listen to one's equip ment, one may listen to the performance, one may listen to Mozart, one may listen to God. I do not at all mean that over the centuries all Wes terners composing or playing or listening to music have intellectually interpreted their doing so in terms of transcendence. Once again, the programme notes are drastically minor compared to the substance of the music. I am simply saying that when I use the term "transcendence" I am referring to such a quality, in beautiful things and in our life in rela tion to them. So far as theory is concerned, I might add that Indian civilization, for example, has at the intellectual level thought about music quite explicitly in transcendentalist terms. And in the West, our legacy of the intel lectual idea of beauty derived from Greek thought has in the past played no minor role, whether conscious or otherwise, in what I am calling the transcendental dimension of our tradition of the arts. In any case, that dimension is there. Truth, if I may turn next to it, has more clearly, more explicitly, been a transcendentalist concept in Western thought, in this case in regularly acknowledged dependence on Greek theorizing, Greek sensitivity. 2 "Le miracle Bach ne s'est produit dans aucun autre art. Dépouiller la nature humaine jusqu'à lui donner des profils divins, placer de la ferveur spirituelle dans les actions les plus à la portée de l'homme, donner des ailes d'eternité à la nature la plus éphémère, rendre humaines les choses divines et divines les choses humaines - Tel est Bach, le moment le plus haut et le plus pur de la musique de tous les temps" - from an autograph photo graphically reproduced in the brochure inserted in the three-record box set of J. S. Bach: The Six'Cello Suites - Pablo Casais, EMI Records, London, n.d. (Box No. RLS 712 [OC 1477 0 00892 M/4M). "Spirituel" in French has, of course, a considerably wider range of meaning than does "spiritual" in English, but given the context it sems reasonable to translate it so here.</page><page sequence="8">Thoughts on Transcendence 39 Truth has beeil seen, been feit, been pursued, and been owed allegiance, as a metaphysical ideal. The "search for truth", until the other day an al most trite phrase, was seen as endless, yet immediately worthwhile, beckoning and sustaining, both imperious and rewarding. Truth has been conceived as elusive yet utterly relevant, always beyond our füll grasp, never utterly beyond our partial grasp, with the strong moral im perative pushing us, pulling us, Welling up within us, to hold what we could of it, and to live in terms of whatever of it has meanwhile been at tained, the while, moving on towards more. At least, this has classically been the case in the academy, and among intellectuals generally. In this case the modern décliné of the sense of transcendence of truth is easily traced. The transition was, first, away from seeing and feeling it as worth spelling with a capital Τ, and more recently away from the con cept almost altogether. This university was founded, after all, with Ve ritas as its motto. This fact profoundly repays contemplating pro foundly. In stark contrast, the word "truth" nowhere appears, I was shocked to discover on my return here from Halifax ten years ago, in the Statement of the then new and proud Arts and Sciences Core Curricu lum. Nowadays academia is focused more on methods than on goals. To many, it is not at all clear that it has a single goal, integrating our diverse endeavours; most do not discern that it has a transcendent goal. In fact, once transcendence is lost sight of, one tends to switch from purpose to procédure. I have not yet written my article for which my proposed title quite engages me: namely, "Methodology as a modern form of atheism". By that I mean that with the loss of a vision of something transcendent pulling us on from ahead and above, pressing us from within, the current académie world has been diverted to specifying, in stead, behavioral régulations for prescribing the pattern of our activi ties. If we don't know where we are headed, then one has to fall back on rules to legislate our movements. This, despite the fact that history is re plete with instances where established rules have obstrueted genuine in tellectual breakthroughs; have proscribed authentically innovative per ceptions and awareness. Also, there have to be différent rules for differ ing fields of study, so that the university becomes a multiversity; and the novel and fissiparous notion of "discipline" intrudes to disrupt intel lectual Community and contributes to the fragmentation of modern life, and knowledge. "From subject-matter to discipline" is the title of an other as yet unwritten article on the contemporary décliné of university life. The concepts "discipline" and "methodology" have become very much part of modern académie orthodoxy. Orthodoxies can stimulate, but eventually they stifle. A large number of modern académies are in pursuit not of truth, but of research grants. Or: of promotion, of furthering their careers. As is often remarked, reason has descended from a considération of ends to a concern merely with means. Reason, rather than being recognized as above us, as something that it is our duty and our privilège to serve, in dividually and corporately, is in this curtailed outlook seen as something</page><page sequence="9">40 WlLFRED CANTWELL SMITH that serves us: an instrument to be used, in our pursuit of whatever per sonal interests we may happen or may choose to have. Thus modern cul ture, in the phrase of Jacques Ellul, has become the striving by ever more "rational" means after ever more irrational ends. Classically, on the other hand, to will what is not good is recognized as no less irrational than to think what is not true. Thus in the transcendent vision, reason conduces to personal integrity and to Community intégra tion; to personl virtue and to the good society. Insofar as that vision is lost, the rational is in danger of merely making more effective the imple menting of our isolations and aggressive competitiveness - internatio nally; socially; and individually. Socrates said that "Knowledge is Virtue"; Bacon, that "knowledge is power". Another title for an article would be "From the pursuit of Truth to the production of knowledge", seeing universities as currently in the business of producing knowledge almost the way other businesses in our society produce cars, for use, for consumption, for the profit of the producers and to be at the disposai of any who may wish to avail themselves of the product to achieve interests they severally may happen to have. This "factory" view of a university provides, I have fïnally begun to see, a rationale behind our otherwise absurd "publish or perish" mad ness. Among the various civilizations of our world and their diverse vi sions of transcendence, we have been speaking of the Western legacy from Greece and Rome, with its articulation of its vision in the triad of beauty, truth, and goodness or justice: a triad ultimately converging. We have lost much of the convergence. For instance, there is talk of "value free" knowledge, though we still feel, inconsistently, that such knowl edge is valuable; and even perhaps that truth is. Moving on to this third of the triad, we may note how the modem conception of "value" also il lustrâtes what is at stake. I am currently at work on a study of scripture, as a human world phe nomenon. I have noted the transition, around the turn of the century and since, from the notion of scripture as a metaphysical judgement to that of various "scriptures" as a sociological observation. The term, among Christians and Jews, used to signify the Bible, understood as The Word of God. Along with the serious questioning among these groups as to wheter this particular book should indeed be seen as given by God to humankind, has gone a growing awareness of other texts - Qur'an, Veda, and what not: texts that Westerners never have held to be of di vine origin, and yet which began in the West to be called scriptures also. This term came to designate, then, something altogether this-worldly: a text that some people, on the whole without good reason, have humanly regarded as cosmic. The différence is stark between seeing (and feeling) something to be divine, and seeing (feeling) it as something that people have historically imagined to be so. A similar transition may be observed in a number of areas. Value is one. This term used to specify morally something of transcendent, of</page><page sequence="10">Thoughts on Transcendence 41 cosmic, significance. "Values", on the other hand — the plural has be come prévalent only this Century — spécifiés indifferently whatever someone or some group rightly or wrongly supposes to be of worth. That so-and-so's values may be without value is an interesting new possibility. The selfinvolvement here is crucial; if one comes to think of also one's own values as whatever it be that one chances or has been led to think of as valuable, then one's ethics is precarious. The slope from académie objectivity to moral nihilism begins to spread out as menac ingly slippery. In a comparable way, terms like "culture", "civilization", "religion" also have shifted from transcendent to positivist understanding. "Cul ture" once designated a certain quality of living, the adjective "un cultured" testifying to this by denoting its absence. It has come to desig nate one or another, rather, of sets of mores, indifferently, without as sessment of worth. In all these cases, the new récognition of pluralism, among scriptures, cultures, religions, and so on, is an inescapable part of modern aware - ness. The effort of some groups to hang on to what in the past served to introduce them — though not their neighbours — to transcendence by neglecting, disparaging, or making war on those outside their own group, is proving disastrous; denying or rejecting pluralism. Much greater truth, as well as much greater goodness, is attained by recogni zing more transcendence rather than less: by recognizing that both the truth, and the goodness, that one has known transcends the form in which one has traditionally known it, while others have known and do know it in différent forms; or, have known or do know other facets of it. One also, in this process, discovers - and this is decidedly healthy - that the particular form through which one's own group was being in troduced to transcendence was in fact a particular, human, finite form; flawed, like everything human; mediating transcendence yet in peril ously earthen vessels. I will later touch on this matter of relativism, also in moral and re ligious life. For the moment, let us proeeed with the conceptual. Current orthodoxy has a distruptive hold in our universities, one that obstruets for many their capacity to discern and to deal intellectually with the foundational human fact of our living in a simultaneously mundane and transcendent environment, of ourselves being simulta neously both mundane and transcendent. Illustrative is the académie fiat that legislates that philosophers, historians, and all must recognize either that there is no transcendence, or that in any case it is not to be talked of — or anyway, not here, not in these halls. Many philosophers, accord ingly, who might have been looked to to solve our problem, have given the impression, rather, of being themselves victims of it. In an area that particularly interests me, theorists have legislated that language refers, or anyway properly refers, only to the empirical. Moreover, when they say this they are thinking speeifieally, however</page><page sequence="11">42 Wilfred Cantwell Smith unwittingly, the nontranscendentalist sense of "empirical" — thus ruling out major empirical facts, such as that most human beings have ob servably lived their lives aware of the transcendence in which they are immersed, and that most human discourse has historically included a transcendent element or reference. This last point it would take a whole lecture in itself to develop; if time were to hand, the observation could be richly demonstrated, statistically. In passing, one may simply observe that the concept of "objective" truth has been developed in considérable part in order to rule out the personal and therefore that transcendent el ement in human thought and discourse, and along with this the rid iculous and disastrous notion that the only alternative to objectivity is subjectivity. This rules out the point that in our very awareness of the world around us we transcend ourselves, and transcend too the gulf, nowadays the chasm, that separates objectivity and subjectivity; the more so, the more truly we know. Truth is transcendent; our ability to apprehend part of this end of it, to touch the hem of its garment, enables us to transcend, if only in part, our isolationisms and subjectivity, to break out of the imprisonment of our self-centered loneliness, our lonely self-centeredness - both so threatening today. Because truth is transcendent, it is not the case, as today is widely sup posed, that propositions are what are true or false. Propositions at best approximate to truth, without ever reaching it fully. More strictly, they themselves do not approximate; rather, their function is to help us as persons to approximate to truth, by articulating or making possible our partial appréhensions, and communicating them. To imagine that propositions might be true has led more recent thinkers in our culture despondently to imagine rather that in fact they are not true at ail - merely convenient ways of talking to those of our friends who happen to share our particular presuppositions. Chomsky has contended that languages are opaque to each other, in the end mutually untranslatable; and Rorty avers that the conversations to which he reduces ail discourse are "mutually incommensurable". These represent a modern-day group solipsism. In fact, however, a person can - and some of us do - learn both or many languages (taking "language" in either Chomsky's literal or in Rorty's figurative sense), and can, do, have friends who speak them (the concept 'friendship' is decisively relevant to this argument, rarely though it he found in modem logic); and one can (some of us do) think about the divergences among those languages, and among those friends; and about the divergences among what each says about the world, or says about some "fact" within the world. Some among us think long and hard about the divergence of the théories with which their présentations of the same fact are laden. One is therein impelled to wards intellectual understanding of that divergence, intellectually in tegrating all that one knows tili now; and indeed one may deliberately learn many languages in order to find out about, to ponder, to understand intellectually and to make intelligible to others, human diversity about life and the world.</page><page sequence="12">Thoughts on Transcendence 43 For example, this is of course what doctoral students in the compara tive study of religion are required to begin doing. (It is also, by the way, what our transcending of disciplinary solipsisms is about.) Counterpart to the concept "truth" is the concept "reality". ( Veritas in Latin means the two equally. It is only the modem West that has sep arated the two ideas, as I have elsewhere shown3.) "Reality" is perhaps particularly relevant to science. The notion that the world transcends our awareness of it has been evaded recently in science by a quiet drop ping of "reality" as a concept. "Reality" is in fact an inescapably tran scendent idea; and so - out it goes. Michael Polanyi, known as champion of the personal in even scientific knowledge, is - therefore, I would say - a champion also of realism and therein (without using the term) of transcendence. He once wrote of "... a conception which, having served for two millennia as a guide to the understanding of nature, has been repudiated by the modem interprétation of science. I am speaking of the conception of reality. Rarely will you find it taught today, that the purpose of science is to discover the hidden reality underlying the facts of nature". He continues, "My purpose is to bring back the idea of real ity and place it at the centre of a theory of scientific enquiry"4. Thomas Kuhn, similarly, explicitly advocates giving up on truth5. "Ail facts are theory-laden", it is being said. This is ridiculously mis leading. Ail statements of facts are indeed theory-laden. Recognizing this helps us to transcend such statements. It helps us, too, towards realizing that facts transcend our awareness of them, without failing to be to some degree immanent within our awareness of them - that is, within our par tial awareness of them; and without failing to be immanent also, one may présumé, within our dissenting neighbours's partial awareness, from whom we can therefore learn. Even if it were the case that linguistic or religious diversity as we find it confronting us were "incommensurable", that pluralism were indi gestible, unintelligible: even so, must it remain so? What about those 3 See my article "A Human View of Truth", in Studies in Religion/Sciences religieuses, 1 (1971): 6-24, reprinted in John Hick, ed.

In the social sciences, the situation is comparable to what he describes for the natural. A striking example is provided by the title of a work by the otherwise rather exceptionally humane and sensitive thinkers Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Realty: a treatise in the sociology of knowledge (New York: Doubleday [1966], Anchor Books, 1967). The book in fact argues for what I would call "The Social Construction of Human Perception of Reality". (Even at that level, of course, the case, though strong, is over-stated. Pioneers of thought transcend that socially con structed perception of reality; and indeed every person does so a little, for instance in his or her awareness of something special — e.g., this sunset — and more than a little, in our awareness of a friend or a loved one.) 5 Thomas S.

If these theorists moan that we shall fail, let us change the metaphor and say that the pluralism stood there untamed two days ago but some have wrestled and striven, and have come up with a comprehensive under standing: yesterday, to take as one illustrative example a Ramanuja from eleventh- or twelfth-century India; or are coming up today, with the comparative study of world history. We are not, never have human beings been, stuck with the status quo. We can move to transcend it — a little; sometimes, a lot. Again, transcendence involves us in movement. Let us turn to two further salient instances of the transcendence that surrounds our lives and flows through us - and at the same time enables us to transcends our own loneliness, to break at least partly out of indi vidualism. These are: history, and society. By "history" I mean the historical process. I have already touched on the point that it transcends the présent; transcends each moment within it, each event, each age. Un fortunately, in our current culture this is a form of transcendence that has begun to be neglected. Our schools tend to an alarming degree to train children careless about the past sector of the historical process into which they have come, or even unaware of it. (Were we not told recently that 65% of first-year College students in the U.S.A. did not know who F. D. Roosevelt was?) Sometimes, even, the young are induced to think rather that history is the past, which they are to be congratulated on having left behind, on having got beyond; an encumbrance from which they should or do shake themselves free, rather than a process in which they participate. History is a process - past, présent, and future - in which they willy-nilly participate, and in which they may participate joyously, and in which they should participate intelligently, construc tively, morally (just as, to repeat, willy-nilly it participâtes in them). When I say that they should participate in it intelligently, constructively, morally, I am saying that they should relate, in their own lives, the vari ous facets of transcendence that envelop them: the contextual, the intel lectual, the practical, the moral. We can and should integrate them - as an element in our own integrity. Speaking of integrity, one may note that our ability to live with in tegrity — more exactly, to move towards integrity in our personal lives — is itself one more example of self-transcendence, since empirically hu man life can, and most human life does, lack this quality, little or much; but we can discern it as an immanent ideal and can strive towards it, and attain some greater measure of it - just as we can always by such striving attain a greater measure of truth than we have yet attained. Linked, also, to human integrity and intégration is the point on which we earlier remarked: the convergence, in the Greek sensibility, of the triad of beauty, truth, and goodness. The more closely one approximates</page><page sequence="14">Thoughts on Transcendence 45 to any one of these, the nearer the other two are seen to be gradually Coming. This récognition of convergence was facilitated by two other elements in the classical transcendence-oriented legacy: idealism, and humanism. In negative secularism, these too have been lost, or trans formed. Idealism has been rejected outright, the term becoming for many a pejorative, the positivist name of a mundane viewpoint now dis paraged, rather than referring to what had been visible from it. "Humanism" as a term survives; but anthröpos, its cosmic category of which each of us is but a less or more adéquate embodiment, was re placed by the conception of actual empirical humanity, us concrète men and women and children - who normally are far from ideal. That is, "humanism", from being a transcendent vision, has become the name of an explicitly non-transcendent mood. This dates from 1906, with the publication of F. S. C. Schiller's manifesto with that title6. We can still say that Hitler acted inhumanly, or was brutal, without thinking through what we mean by this. And our adjective "humane" still con nûtes without for many being able any longer to dénoté. When I say that history is a transcending process, I am diverging from the current (recent; positivist) habit of thinking of it rather as someting fïnite: namely, as what I call, rather, "historiography". As I have on another occasion remarked, the history of Canada is long, com plex, and embedded within the history of Europe and North America and beyond; whereas a History of Canada may be short, over-sim plifïed, and weigh two pounds. In other words, there are two usages for our word "history"; and the second of these is logically derivative from the first, and it is to be judged by it. A written or perceived history ap proximates, always distantly, to the actual historical. Our awareness of the past, or of the current transformations of the world, is always a very 6 F. S. C. Schiller, Humanism: philosophical essays (London: Macmillans, 1906). Some of its chapters had no doubt appeared somewhat earlier in learned journals; in book form the author averred that he hoped that his views would reach "the général public" (opening page of the "Préfacé"), which indeed, in that form, they did. His Préfacé makes quite clear that he was consciously giving the term "humanism" a new meaning. He notes that earlier he had attempted to use "anthropomorphism" in this new sense, but had decided that altering the prévalent meaning of that term "may prove difficult"; he had higher hopes for his proposed new use of the other term - hopes that turned out to be validated by events. "I propose . . . to convert to the use of philosophie terminology a word which has long been famed in history and literature, and to denominate HUMANISM the attitude of thought which . . . is destined, I believe, to win the widest popularity" - Préfacé to the first édition; I have used the second, 1912, edn., where this passage is reproduced on pp. xix-xx. Again, he speaks of the "transfer of its [sc., this term's] old associations to a novel context" - ibid., p. xxv of the 2nd edn.; and he devotes Space to defending the new use of the term. In his Préfacé to the Second Edition, ibid., p. ix, he notes that his " choice of the word 'Humanism' as expressive of" the novel outlook "has been vindicated". Writing as a philosopher (that is, within the Graeco-Roman steam in Western Civilization), his explicit thesis is that the new view being advocated is proffered as an alternative not to theism, which he is inclined to set aside, so much as to Platonism and all that it has involved — that is, to the chief grounding other than the Judeo-Christian in Western history of the tran scendentalist outlook. (Nonetheless, he retains "idealism" and even the concept of life after death.)</page><page sequence="15">46 Wilfred Cantwell Smith partial appréhension of the reality of that past, or of that présent. Yet many in the modern West seem increasingly to be concentrating on that partial appréhension; on the report about the reality, the ideas in someone's mind of what has been and is happening. A surprising number of persons, especially in academia, when they hear the term "history" these days, think of the finite, concrète, Störy that is told or thought about the past - at times even to the exclusion of attending to the transcending reality of which it is an always inadéquate though ser viceable représentation. It is one more instance of our de-transcenden talizing thrust. (It took me quite a while to figure out why my own writ ing using the word "history" was so frequently misunderstood.) I am suggesting that we should participate self-consciously, and that we may participate joyously, in the on-going process. One of the highly effective ways of doing this has traditionally been through periodic ritual célébration and re-enactment of outstanding moments of the com munity's earlier life. These have constituted a pattern by which each suc ceeding génération has been enabled to appropriate to itself, and to ap propriate itself to, the venerable process, the embracing, and sustaining, and continuing process, of its historical development - and each mem ber of each génération. The modern neglect of such symbolic forms has, alas, meant that many modems are precluded from this particular avenue, as also from so many other well-trodden avenues, to vivid par ticipation in something greater than ourselves, and yet inherent in our sei ves. There is also a sorrowful point, relating to the fact that through such repeated group actions a Community is held together in each succeeding présent. Such corporate participation in transcendence has been basic in advancing a group beyond Gesellschaft to Gemeinschaft, turning a society into a Community, and an individual into a person. Without these re-pre sentings, the reiterated re-rendering of their joint inheritance and the re distributing of it among them all, the members of the society are dis tanced not only from their past, but also from each other. Unfortunately, one may even add: and thereby from themselves. This has brought us to our next matter: the social. Obviously, there is no time, and I trust no need, to develop the manifest point that for hu man beings Community, as well as history, is a traditional locus of tran scendence. Every society transcends each of its members. Each par ticipâtes in it, it in each. Dürkheim took social cohésion for granted, and argued that religion is derivative from society. In fact, however, now that one can no longer take for granted the awareness of transcendence and the activating of that awareness in its so-called religious as in other forms, we can see that Community, the enriched form of society, is de rived from religion or from some alternative form of transcendent truth. Dürkheim was right that the reality of Community is transcendent; but alas, one can fail to see it, and can then lose it.</page><page sequence="16">Thoughts on Transcendence 47 One may note the important example of transcendence given by the Community constituted in friendship; not least, the communion of a man and a woman in love. My talk is not an apology for religion. I am speaking about transcen dence. The religious has no doubt been a major form in which transcen dence has been mediated among us. Yet it has been not the only form, as I have insisted. Moreover, religious médiation of it has often been far from successful. Our awareness of and response to the transcendent is, at our end, human. This means that religion is. So also, however, is non transcendence human: our persistent tendency to be distracted by the merely mundane — including, alas, our innate stupidities and wicked ness. We live in a double context. Religion, being human, lives in that double context too. The upsurging religious right - reactionary "funda mentalism" or whatever it be called - is not simply an expression of transcendence (though it is a reaction against the absence of transcen dence in the surrounding culture). Rather, it is what happens to religion when the général sense of transcendence has waned. It is the disastrously mistaken supposition that the mundane forms are themselves the tran scending reality. It is the penalty paid by themselves and especially by the rest of us when some people's clear awareness of transcendingness has grown weak, though perhaps not their sense of the transcendent as mediated; and they see no further than the concrète forms that once were a Channel for them to something higher. When I say that their clear awareness of transcendingness has grown weak, I mean that although they are brought back into some touch with the transcendent, yet this occurs in a form in which they fail to see that what they have been enabled to meet transcends the form in which they are meeting it. It is also the penalty that we all pay when the alternatives to religion, and especially modern liberal secularism, begin patently to fail to mediate any transcendence at all. It has become painfully manifest that something is missing. (And let us not underestimate the pain). Rather than berating fundamentalists, we would do better to recognize that we liberal intellectuals are at fault, as well. We have failed the mod ern world, and it is in danger of taking its revenge on us, out of desper ation. One of the central examples of our problem is the question of rela tivism, earlier alluded to. It has been made compelling by modern awareness, and made threatening by modernity's imposed ceiling on awareness. Inéluctable variety has become conspicuous, in virtually every area of life, including the moral and the religious; so that there is no firm ground on which to stand. This can be terrifying for those who see nothing higher than the ground. Relativism seems to issue in nihilism, for those of curtailed vision. In our transcendentalizing con text, on the other hand, relativism is no problem at all. On the contrary, it enriches. Every position — intellectual, moral, religious, whatever — that human beings concoct is finite, limited, contingent, relative. Yet if each, including our own, is seen as an approximation to something</page><page sequence="17">48 Wilfred Cantwell Smith higher, to something ultimate and not relative, then we can proceed bravely, cheerfully, with diffidence yet confidence, humble yet cou rageous. We strive to bring our own approximation ever closer to the Truth, and are happy to collaborate with others next door and around the world to share and to learn, moving ahead with that diffidence plus confidence, knowing with some assurance that our positions are indeed relative yet that through them we are in however distant touch with the transcending real. This way we can have compassion both for ourselves and for our friends who may differ from us, even perhaps drastically; and compassion even for our enemies. The relation between what I am calling mundane and what I am call ing the transcendent has been variously conceived. Whether the two are continuous, or overlapping, or radically disparate; two sides of the same coin or in irresolvable conflict; whether what seems the higher is in fact the same as the lower but differently perceived, or more penetratingly perceived, and so on - these are questions to which diverse answers, to put it mildly, have been given. What exactly is the nature of the tran scendent, transcends our conceptual grasp, as you have heard me, as well as many another, say. That it is there, and is important, cannot rea sonably be gainsaid. I could go on, since the list of areas in which transcendence has met us human beings, and may meet us, and we it/Him/Her, is endless. But my talk has become too endless already. I close, with a moment's return to the specific matter with which we began: immortality. I spoke early on about "eternal life", and remarked that what I mean by that Christian phrase is found among Buddhists, Jews, and others in the same measure as among Christians, but noted that they formulate it in words and con cepts differently, perceive it in différent forms. One interesting instance is provided by the Muslim term, found in the Qur'an and richly de veloped in Islamic thought over the centuries, and profoundly signifi cant in the lives of Muslims great and small over those same centuries: namely, the Arabie term al-äkhirah. Literally this means "what comes after", and has popularly been imagined, in the Muslim world, as has "eternal life" in the Christian stream, as "life after death" (with Heaven and Hell and all that), rather like also the Hebrew formula "having a part in the world to come". Another Islamic interprétation of al-akbirah, however, one well established in Sufi circles, is that it désignâtes what comes after in the more here-and-now sense of what lies under the surface or behind outward appearances; what comes after probing, after maturing; what comes with more pénétration of Spiritual insight, and is found to be more and more rieh, more and more divine, as one's faith grows more sensitive and appréciative of the ultimate quality of life and of the world in which we live. In this connection, then, if one were to use Frege's concepts, of "sense" and "reference", we could say that "this</page><page sequence="18">Thoughts on Transcendence 49 world" and "the next world" (in Arabie, "what is nearer by" and "what comes after") are two terms whose sense respectively has for many been polarized chronologically, the one following the other in time, but whose reference is in the one case the immédiate or superficial aspects of our environment and our existence, and in the other case the true full ness of these, their cosmic reality beyond that immédiate and superficial, not quite beyond our reach. This reference of the term al-akhira is the one that I give to "the transcendent". The validity of this way of understanding is, alas, illustrated by what has been going on historically in the Western world of late. In our day, ordinary people have lost what they called "a belief in the other world", but the loss has been accompanied by a nagging impoverishment, shal lowness, bleakness, of "life in this world". This has been not a sermon; it is an intellectual thesis. When I said just now that the reality of transcendence cannot reasonably be gainsaid, the key word was "reasonably". This much at least, I submit, must be con ceded by any reasonable person: that as an hypothesis, it makes more coherent and illuminating sense of a far wider range of the observable facts of human life today, than does its négation, that we human beings - each of us individually and all of us corporately - live in what I am call ing the double context of mundane and transcendent: a mundane that is shot through with transcendence, a transcendent that we apprehend, ai though in always mundane - and often distorted, sometimes even dem onic; yet always improvable - ways. The human problem is to cope with this double-context situation. The intellectual problem is to understand it.</page></plain_text>
