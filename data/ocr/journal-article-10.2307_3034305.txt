<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENT Anthropomorphism and the evolution of cognition Pascal Boyer provides a persuasive argument for what makes anthropomorphism natural: the very fact that it is counter-intuitive V. Roy. an- throp. Inst. (N.S.) 2, 83-97). Drawing on recent research in developmental psychology concern- ing domain-specific mental modules, he sug- gests that ideas about anthropomorphic entities are pervasive in human culture because, while they exhibit sufficient counter-intuitive as- sumptions to make them attention-grabbing, they also have sufficient 'intuitive background' to have inferential potential; in other words, they are easy to grasp. Consequently anthropo- morphism is a pervasive, perhaps universal, way of thinking. This argument depends upon the human mind having a set of ontological categories and domain-specific principles which constitute an 'intuitive ontology'. To support this, Boyer makes a gesture to- wards evolutionary theory: 'There are good evolutionary arguments', he states, 'for assum- ing that natural selection would have equipped human minds with a variety of domain-specific conceptual categories, each carrying strong prior assumptions about its domain of applica- tion, rather than an all-purpose and uncon- strained form of general intelligence' (p. 86). This is quite correct; the 'good evolutionary ar- gument' is that those individuals who applied specific ways of thinking to specific adaptive problems would be at a selective advantage (Cosmides &amp; Tooby 1994). But this is exactly the opposite of how Boyer argues that people actually think: they apply ways of thinking to inappropriate domains. As a consequence, we find people who believe that mountains breath and that trees can listen. According to the 'good evolutionary arguments' such individuals would have been selected against long ago in our evolutionary past. So how can this 'good evolutionary argument', and the evidence for how people think, be compatible with each other? A resolution of this apparent contradiction can be found by drawing on evidence from the archaeological and fossil records concerning the evolution of the human mind, and more spe- cifically, concerning anthropomorphic thinking. If we consider the time period after 250,000 years ago there were several types of 'Early Hu- mans' living in Africa, Europe and Asia. These were large-brained hominids, evolutionary de- scendants of H. erectus, the best known of which was H. neanderthalensis. Although Neanderthals are unlikely to have been direct ancestors of modern humans, they are likely to have been cognitively and behaviourally similar to the rather less well known archaic H. sapiens in Africa, which was probably our direct ancestor (this follows an 'Out of Africa' scenario for modern human origins). We have no evidence that Neanderthals or other Early Humans engaged in anthropomor- phic thinking. The absence of evidence is not, of course, the evidence of absence; quite how anthropomorphic thinking would be repre- sented archaeologically is unclear. Neverthe- less, as I have argued elsewhere (Mithen 1994; 1996), it is most likely that Early Humans had a domain-specific mentality - a series of mental modules, cognitive domains or intelligences that were essentially modern in character but which operated in isolation from each other. It is only by attributing these hominids with such minds that we can make sense of the archae- ological record. How could Neanderthals, for instance, have shown such technical intelli- gence when making stone tools - which are as complex as any made by modern humans - but ignored materials such as bone and ivory which would have considerably improved their tech- nological repertoire? How could they have had such complex social lives, as implied by studies of their brain size (Dunbar 1993), but not used items of material culture as a medium for social interaction? Neanderthals and other Early Hu- mans seem to have been unable to transfer ways of thinking and knowledge from one cog- nitive domain to another. It is most likely that they possessed an intuitive belief-desire psy- chology, as this appears to have been present early in human evolution (Byrne 1995). In the Early Human mind this was probably as well developed as it is in the modern mind. Yet we have no evidence that this was projected onto non-intentional objects, as it is natural for modern humans. Consequently, the mentality of these Early Humans appears to be precisely what we are led to expect from 'good evolu- tionary arguments': they had a domain-specific mentality.</page><page sequence="2">718 COMMENT It is only with the first anatomically modern humans, appearing 100,000 years ago, that we find evidence for such projections, and more generally for the transfer of knowledge and ways of thinking across domains. The first sign of this is the burials in the caves of Qafzeh and Skhul in the Near East. Although Neanderthals had buried some of their dead, these are the first burials in which parts of animal carcasses were placed with human bodies, implying that some identity was being posited between indi- viduals and specific types of animals. For in- stance, in Qafzeh the head and antlers of a deer were placed in the hands of a child. The first conclusive evidence of anthropomorphic think- ing comes with the appearance of art in Europe 30,000 years ago. One of the earliest pieces of art is an ivory statuette of a man's body with a lion's head, from Hohlenstein-Stadel in south- ern Germany (Marshack 1990). And in the cave of Chavuet, in which the earliest repre- sentational wall art is found, there is a painting of a 'creature' with the head and torso of a bi- son and human legs (Chauvet et al. 1996). Although we can never be sure that Early Humans did not engage in anthropomorphic thinking, it is most likely that it began only with modern humans after 100,000 years ago, and was a pervasive way of thinking by the start of the Upper Palaeolithic 40,000 years ago. Other lines of evidence also suggest that it is only at this period that ways of thinking and knowledge which had evolved in different cog- nitive domains began to be mapped onto each other (Mithen 1996). For instance, the appear- ance of personal ornaments at 40,000 years ago in Europe and Africa indicate that material cul- ture was for the first time being used as a means of denoting personal identity and con- veying social information. Similarly, the tech- nological changes after 40,000 years ago, as in systematic blade technology and increasing di- versity in tool kits, suggest that detailed knowl- edge and understanding of animal behaviour were drawn upon when tools were made, re- placing the monotonous Early Human technol- ogy which showed no functional responsive- ness to ecological variability. So it appears that by 100,000 years ago, ana- tomically modern humans had evolved abilities to project their intuitive belief-desire psychol- ogy onto non-intentional objects and, more generally, to transfer knowledge between do- mains, resulting in the naturalness of religious ideas and anthropomorphic thinking. The evo- lution of such capacities, and then the spread of modern humans, probably by replacing all re- maining Early Human populations, testify to the adaptive value of this way of thinking. The functional utility of anthropomorphic thinking has indeed been demonstrated in ethnographic studies. Blurton-Jones &amp; Konner (1976) demon- strated that by attributing animals with human- like minds the !ung were able to make as ac- curate predictions of animal behaviour as West- ern scientists can by drawing on their knowl- edge of behavioural ecology. Douglas (1990) has also stressed the practical utility gained from anthropomorphic thinking in terms of understanding and predicting animal behaviour. Indeed I have suggested that the behavioural differences between anatomically modern hu- mans and Neanderthals in the Near East when hunting gazelle with the same technology (Lie- berman &amp; Shea 1994), are likely to be due to the former's ability to predict gazelle move- ments and behaviour by using anthropomor- phic thinking (Mithen 1996), which provided them with greater hunting efficiency. The adaptive value gained by anthropomor- phic thinking could only have been attained, however, after the domain-specific modules had attained a sufficiently advanced state them- selves. The transfer of knowledge across do- mains required a robust domain-specific archi- tecture already in place within the Early Human mind. As Fodor (1983) once pointed out, it is no doubt important for people to con- template about the world, such as by believing in religious entities, but it is more important not to be eaten. And to guard against the latter one requires domain-specific mental modules (Cosmides &amp; Tooby 1994). Consequently, a historical condition for anthropomorphic thinking to have evolved is the existence of di- rect ancestors with domain-specific mentality. A critical factor in the transition from a domain-specific to what I have termed a 'cog- nitively fluid mentality' is likely to have been an intensified use of language. As Aiello and Dunbar (1993; Dunbar 1993) have argued, Early Humans are likely to have had sophisti- cated linguistic abilities, but the content of their language was probably restricted to the domain of social behaviour. As language began to take on more general-purpose functions, new ways of thinking arose. Sperber has proposed the ex- istence of a 'metarepresentational module' as the means by which the human mind can come up with notions of anthropomorphic beings and the like. This is a direct consequence of language: As a result of the development of communication, and particularly linguistic communication', he argued, 'the actual domain of the metarepresentational module is teeming with representations made manifest by com- municative behaviours ... An organism en- dowed with ... a metarepresentational module ... may form representations of concepts and beliefs pertaining to all conceptual domains, of a kind that the modules in those domains might be unable to form on their own' (Sper- ber 1994: 61). Boyer's arguments suggest that only some of these concepts and beliefs will survive the rigours of cultural transmission. In summary, if we consider the naturalness of anthropomorphism from an evolutionary per- spective, it has only become natural very recently,</page><page sequence="3">COMMENT 719 probably in the last 100,000 years and possibly only in the last 40,000 years. It was not a natu- ral way of thinking for Neanderthals and all other Early Humans. Indeed for them it was probably not only unnatural, but simply impos- sible. Yet it is only because it was impossible for them, and more specifically for the direct an- cestor of anatomically modern humans, that we can today believe that mountains breathe, trees listen and animals have marriage ceremonies.

Steven Mithen is quite right to point to a possi- ble ambiguity in my original formulation of 'good evolutionary arguments' in support of domain-specificity. His own argument may help clarify what should be a central concern of cultural anthropology: namely, the causal links between evolved predispositions and recurrent features of cultural transmission. I will only add a few remarks to dispel a potential misunder- standing of our common enterprise. The ex- perimental evidence shows that 'anthropomor- phism' lumps together two different types of representations, which probably have distinct evolutionary origins. The starting point is that natural selection would probably favour the development of do- main-specific capacities, specialized in their in- put and largely autonomous, rather than some general intelligence or all-purpose inductive heuristics. Given a rich endowment of this kind, cognitive models should specify what cues automatically trigger such specialized ca- pacities, the extent to which these capacities can extend to other types of information, and the possible transfers of information between spe- cialized devices. In his book, Mithen has shown that a careful examination of these features can illuminate the archaeological record. In particular, Mithen documents a striking difference in the opera- tion of 'modular' capacities between Neander- thals and Early Humans. The former seem trapped in cognitive routines which are often as sophisticated as those of Early Humans, but unlikely to change as a result of new conditions or different resources. By contrast, Early Hu- mans seem able to apply such routines to new objects. In the case of tool-making, there is an extension of cognitive recipes to new materials. In the case of various anthropomorphic repre- sentations, there seems to be an activation of capacities (intuitive psychology) by cues that belong to a different ontological domain. The main difference, then, between the two populations stems from the fact that specialized capacities could be triggered in Early Humans by cues that were significantly different from those with which they were associated in earlier evolutionary history. There are two possible ways of explaining this: (1) that Early Humans developed general meta-representational abilities, such that they could consciously apply special- ized capacities to domains which do not usually activate them (this is the 'fluid cognition' expla- nation) or (2) that the new species simply had a different ontology, in the sense that the same capacities were now activated by different (often larger) sets of environmental cues. These explanations are not incompatible. In- deed, it seems to me that both are true, but that they are true of different aspects of cognitive evolution. It is possible to sort out which of</page><page sequence="4">720 COMMENT these mechanisms can explain modern per- formance by considering early development in modern humans. Some aspects of cognitive performance appear very early, before sophisti- cated meta-cognitive capacities are active. Oth- ers only appear after years of conceptual devel- opment, including mastery of a natural language. These may be more clearly linked to possession of general meta-representational capacities. This distinction is relevant to ques- tions of 'anthropomorphism'; the term is mis- leading because it includes representations that belong to both sides of the distinction. Let me first consider the fact that intuitive psychological principles (commonly called an intuitive 'theory of mind') are readily applied to animals as well as humans. We know that, from an early age, children are likely to attribute goals, beliefs and desires principally to humans, but also to any object that is self-propelled, i.e. whose motion is not explained by external me- chanical causation. Later, children consistently deny that artefacts, whatever their external re- semblance to animals, could have purposive be- haviour. These expectations appear early in cognitive development; they are delivered equally automatically on the basis of similar cues for animals and humans. So it would be contrived to assume that they require a 'trans- fer' of human properties onto animals. It seems more plausible that the interpretation of both animal and human behaviour in intentional terms is part and parcel of evolved intuitive on- tology. Mithen's argument that intentional in- terpretation of animal behaviour is a recent phenomenon can be maintained, without as- suming that there is evidence here for a special fluidity or flexibility in modern human cogni- tion. Early and modern Humans simply have an intuitive ontology that differs from that of earlier species in spontaneously attributing be- liefs and intentions to animals, and which en- hances predictive power and is probably more adaptive, as Mithen rightly points out. By contrast, consider another domain, that of cultural representations which violate intuitive principles. These are not part of evolved intui- tive ontology, but quite the opposite. My pre- diction was that such representations can be entertained and survive cycles of cultural trans- mission only to the extent that (1) they focus attention by going against the expectations de- livered by intuitive ontology, and (2) other principles of intuitive ontology are activated, to give them some inferential power. This implies definite predictions concerning the cognitive processes involved; in particular, it implies that common religious categories should include an explicit counter-intuitive core and a back- ground of mainly tacit intuitive inferential principles. There is now some experimental evidence that this is precisely what takes place in the rep- resentation of some religious categories. In a series of ingenious experiments, Barett and Keil (in press) examined the assumptions underly- ing concepts of 'God' and other non-natural agents in both believers and non-believers. The subjects' explicit notions of God were a cata- logue of counter-intuitive claims about extraor- dinary cognitive powers; God can perceive everything at once, focus his attention on mul- tiple events simultaneously, and so on. The subjects were then tested on their recall of sim- ple stories involving God in various scenarios in which such capacities are displayed. In gen- eral, subjects tended to distort or add to the stories in ways directly influenced by their tacit, intuitive principles of psychology. For instance, they recalled that God attended to some prob- lem and then turned his attention to another, or that God could not perceive some event because of some obstacle, all details that were not in the original stories. Notice that this application of intuitive principles which specify limitations on cognitive powers (e.g. perceptions are hindered by obstacles between the object and the per- ceiving subject) is in direct contradiction to the subjects' explicit beliefs about God. There can be such contradictions because, as predicted in the original model, the two registers of repre- sentations are distinct and contribute to differ- ent aspects of the representation of religious categories: attention-grabbing salience for counter-intuitive assumptions, and inferential potential for tacit intuitive assumptions. It is clear that this kind of representation re- quires the 'fluidity' described by Mithen, and in particular the capacity to hold repre- sentations that violate intuitive expectations. This could not be possible without some meta- representational capacities. As Mithen suggests, such capacities may be a recent phenomenon probably linked to increased demands for so- phisticated mind-reading capacities. Because social interaction requires complex intuitions about other people's intentions and beliefs, it is advantageous to complement intuitive psychol- ogy with the ability to meta-represent one's own intuitions. To sum up, the evolution of modern human cognition may have resulted in two different kinds of innovation. On the one hand, modern humans have a rather different intuitive onto- logy from their forebears. On the other hand, they also have complex meta-representational capacities. Both factors contribute to shaping the 'cognitive tracks' of acquisition that constitute recurrent cultural representations. It is possible to distinguish the effects of these different changes in experimental studies and, in particu- lar, to show that phenomena indiscriminately labelled 'anthropomorphism' belong to two rather different domains. These brief remarks are not objections to Mithen's impressive evi- dence nor to his description of the Neanderthal- Early Human contrast, but an attempt to</page><page sequence="5">COMMENT 721 describe more precisely the consequences of such evolutionary trends for modern cognition.
