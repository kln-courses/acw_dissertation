<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROUTES OF THE RADANITES By L. RABINOWITZ, London AMONG the many steps taken by Abdal-malik (691-705), the fifth of the Ommayad Caliphs for the organisation and good government of his rapidly extending realm was the institution of a regular post-service from Damascus to the provincial capitals. It was destined primarily for govern- ment despatches, but generally it was of use for ease of communications. The postmasters were charged with the task of informing the caliphs of all important news in their respective countries.' The institution remained, and more than a century after his death2 Aboul Kassim Obaidallah Ibn Khordadbeh, son of the Governor of Taharistan, and Postmaster General to the Caliphate of Baghdad, wrote his Book of Ways3 in which occurs the famous and oft-quoted passage4 about the Jewish merchants called the Radanites who, in his time, journeyed by four separate and distinct routes from Western Europe to China and back in pursuit of their I Encyclopedia Britannica, 13th ed. art.

As far as I am aware this important document has not been subjected to an analysis worthy of its impor- tance, nor has the place of these merchants in Jewish and general economic history been seen in its proper perspec- tive. The present article, though written under conditions of unusual difficultys aims at being a first contribution to this subject and an introduction to a detailed study of these routes which I hope to undertake. Out of it a new and true picture of these merchants emerges. The passage reads as follows:6 "These merchants speak Arabic, Persian, Roman, the language of the Franks, Andalusians and Slavs. They journey from west to east, from east to west, partly on land, partly by sea. They transport from the west eunuchs, female and male slaves, silk, castor, marten and other furs, and swords. They take ship in the land of the Franks, on the Western Sea, and steer for Farama. There they load their goods on the backs of camels, and go by land to Kolzum in five days journey, over a distance of twenty- five parasangs. They embark in the East Sea and sail from Kolzum to el-Jar and Jeddah: then they go to Sind, India and China. On their return they carry back musk, aloes, camphor, cinnamon and other products of the Eastern countries to Kolzum, and bring them to Farama, where they again embark on the Western Sea. Some make sail s I have written this article literally "in the field" while waiting to accompany the invasion forces, as Senior Jewish Chaplain, for the liberation of Europe. I have relied mostly upon notes collected during more peaceful times, but for certain corroboratory facts I have had to refer to secondary authorities where in normal times I would have referred to the originals. It is hoped that these defects will under the circumstances be overlooked, and that the conclusions arrived at are not thereby vitiated. 6 I have followed Roth's version, omitting only his identification of the places mentioned, which I hope to treat of exhaustively in a sub- sequent article. 252</page><page sequence="3">ROUTES OF RADANITES-RABINOWITZ for Constantinople to sell their goods to the Romans, others go to the palace of the King of the Franks to place their goods. "Sometimes these Jew merchants prefer to carry their goods from the land of the Franks in the Western Sea, making for Antioch: thence they go by land to al-Jabia, where they arrive after three days march. There they embark on the Euphrates for Baghdad, and then sail down the Tigris to al-Obolla. From al-Obolla they sail for Oman, Sind, Hind and China. All this is connected with one another. "These different journeys can also be made by land. The merchants that start from Spain or France go to Sous-al- Akza, and then to Tangiers, whence they march to Kai- rouan and the capital of Egypt. Thence they go to al-Ramla, visit Damascus, al-Kufa, Baghdad and Basra, cross Ahwaz, Fars, Kirman, Sind, Hind and arrive at China. Sometimes they likewise take the route behind Rome, and, passing through the country of the Slavs, arrive at Khamlif, the capital of the Khazars. They embark on the Jorjan Sea, arrive at Balkh, betake themselves from there across the Oxus, and continue their journey toward Yurt and Toghog- zor, and from there to China." Nearly all the writers who have dealt with this passage regard these Radanites as a unique phenomenon who thus appear on the pages of history like a comet in the sky, to dazzle for a moment and as quickly disappear. There is an element of surprise and wonder at the revelation of their existence, and a tendency to regard them as intrepid adventurers, blazing unknown trails in the search for monetary gain. In contradistinction to such a view the thesis here maintained is that the emergence and the existence of these travelling merchants in the 9th century are so natural and so normal a result of the trade conditions 253</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and the facilities open for trade to Jews, that it would have been possible to reconstruct them without this classical passage. In point of fact, their very name, which is none other than the Persian "rah dan," "wayfarers"7 suggests normal travel. In order fully to appreciate these facts, however, it is necessary first to discuss the position of the Jews in the East and in the West in the 9th centuries, and the oppor- tunities for trade open to them. It is convenient for this purpose to divide the subject into its two component parts, the Mahommedan world and Christian Europe. I. THE MAHOMMEDAN WORLD There is no need, for our immediate purpose to go further into the pre-Mahommedan world than the period of the Babylonian Talmud. There is no doubt that during this period Jewish communities existed and flourished in all the large towns and centres of Babylon and Persia8 and that their connections, both religious and commercial, extended as far as India. It is to this last country that I wish to confine myself, connections with the extreme countries presupposing connections with the intermediate points. Not only do we have explicit mention of ginger,9 linen,'1 iron" coming from India, but we have actually mention of Rab Judah, an Indian convert to Judaism who 7 Comp. Jacobs, op. cit. p. 196, note.

Graetz'3 dates the arrival of Joseph Rabban (whose name strongly suggests a Babylonian origin) to the coast of Malabar at the year 490 when, as a result of persecutions in Babylonia at the end of the fifth century, Jews emigrated to Arabia and India. In this connection, the tradition of the Beni Israel that they were the survivors of a band of Jews fleeing from persecution and wrecked near the Henery and Kenery Islands in the Indian Ocean, fifteen miles from Cheul, the chief emporium of trade between Arabia and India, is not without interest.'4 That by this time Jewish communities existed in Yemen is too well estab- lished to need elaboration, while the existence of the community of Aden, where Arabian maritime commerce was almost entirely concentrated's may be assumed.'6 There is, as far as I am aware, no reference to Jews in China, or contact with it, in the talmudic literature.I7 These ties between Babylonia and the countries to the East of it as far as India, as indeed to the West as far as Spain, were immeasurably strengthened by the Mahom- medan conquest. The unification of all these countries under one rule naturally favored the development of communications and trade'8 and as a result the Jews in Babylonia as a whole turned from agricultural pursuits to trade with these furthest lands.19 This change is reflected 2 Kid. 22b.

In 78721 the two Geonim, R. Bibi and R. Haninai annulled the Talmudic law whereby the interests of orphans were protected by forbidding a lien on their movable goods for the payment of debts or a wife's marriage settlement (Ketubah). The promulgation of this new law was attended with every circumstance of importance and urgency. Not only was it signed by the two Geonim together with the Exilarch, but it was circu- lated to all communities with an instruction that "the judge who refuses to decide in accordance with this ruling is to be removed from office."22 In an agricultural commu- nity movables are of secondary importance and a prohibi- tion of a lien on them need not hamper economic activity. In a trading community however, where the whole of a man's wealth consists of movables, such a prohibition would exercise a stranglehold on trade, and would generally be23 unconscionable. It was for this reason24 that the original ban was annulled. The parallel with the Prosbul of Hillel is of course striking, but it is not accidental, since both were due to the same circumstances.? The Mahommedan conquest had another result which conduced to the facility of trade among the Jews of the Mahommedan world. The authority of the political head of Babylonian Jewry, the Resh Galuta or Exilarch was coterminous at least with the boundaries of the Mahom- medan empire26 while that of the spiritual leaders, the 20 See Baron, SRH 1. 326 for some examples. 2I For the date see H.

It may be said without fear of contradiction, as will indeed be shown later, that the Geonim held undisputed spiritual sway over the Jewish communities in an area greater in extent than that of the contemporary Pope or Caliph. The trading advantages of the Jews depended to a decisive extent, upon the unity of Judaism, as well as upon the existence of Jewish com- munities all along the routes taken by the Radanites, and this unity of political, and to a greater extent spiritual rule, was a factor the importance of which cannot be overes- timated, especially when we realize that civil and com- mercial law came under the heading of spiritual. The profits accruing from the Indian and Chinese trade must have been enormous. A century after Ibn Khor- dadbeh, Saadya Gaon, who incidentally refers to the fakirs of India27 quotes the popular saying of the "ignorami of the town" that "whoever goes to India becomes rich"28 How rich may be shown by the remarkable story of "Ishaq, the Jew's son," who returned to Oman, which he had left thirty years earlier with a modest sum, in his own ship containing his own goods, after trading with India and China. He paid a round sum of 1,000,000 dirhems in lieu of custom duty!29 How much greater must have been the glittering money prizes of those who could bring these goods to Christian Europe where they had a virtual monopoly. It was not only Eastwards that the rule of the Caliphs ran. It extended West along the whole length of the North African littoral as far as Morocco, and past the Pillars of Hercules to Spain; it was indeed upon this that the third route of the Radanites depended. san, Yemen, Mesopotamia, Siberia, Turkey, Georgia, Samarkand, Tibet and India.

II. CHRISTIAN EUROPE Documents and records of the Jews in Europe during the 9th century, when the Radanites were active, are few and far between. They are to all intents and purposes practically non-existent, and for our reconstruction we have to rely upon scattered references, mostly in Christian works, and upon the application of the circumstances of a slightly later age to an earlier one, when it can be shown that the same circumstances apply. The record of the Radanites tends rather to fill in lacunae in our knowledge of the Jewish communities in Christian Europe in this century than to accord with independent knowledge of them. The results of our meagre knowledge, however, all tend in one direction showing that the Jewish communi- ties of Europe were established on the trade routes across the Continent and that this probably determined the choice of their location. It has recently been pointed out that the early Jewish settlements in Europe often nestled about the old Roman trade routes.32 The oldest known trade 30 The establishment of the separate Fatimide Caliphate in Egypt and North Africa in 969 did not affect this. 3r The preference for Mahommedan routes is shown by the fact that three of the four routes lead to Mahommedan territory at the earliest moment. The choice of the fourth, right across Europe was undoubtedly determined by the needs of the slave trade, since slaves could be ob- tained only in Bohemia. See below. 32 R. Anchel, "The Early History of the Jewish Quarters in Paris," Jewish Social Studies, ii.

Trains of pack animals carried the goods over the Alpine passes to the Rhine, whence they were transported by river to Cologne and the cities of Flanders for despatch to Northern France, England, Northern Germany and Scandi- navia.33 Venice, the Rhineland and Cologne were the seats of the earliest Jewish communities of Europe. It is of more than passing interest that on the return journey, furs from the northern forests were the principal commodi- ties of trade.34 Ibn Khordadbeh makes specific mention of the fact that the Radanites carried furs from West to East, and Caro35 has already pointed out, independently of this fact, that these furs could only have come from the northern lands. It is by no means improbable that they picked them up in Cologne, or in the Rhineland towns of Speyer, Worms and Mayence for onward transmission. So also Troyes, one of the earliest communities, stood at the point of convergence of many important medieval highways.36 The other commodity of the Radanites, and probably the chief one, which they carried from West to East was slaves. The full import of this unpleasant traffic will be discussed later. Suffice it at the moment to point out that with the strict canonical prohibition against the Jews dealing in Christian slaves, the only lands of their prov- enance were the countries east of the Elbe, the heathen countries of Bohemia and Moravia and further east, in fact the land of Sclavonia whence the word slaves derives. The Jews were charged with having a predilection for 33 Enc. Britt. 14th ed.

Prague was the entrepot of this trade. Not only was it the first Bohemian town in which Jews settled39 but the earliest reference to Jews in this town connects them specifically with this human traffic. Ibrahim ibn Jakub, a Spanish Jew, visited the town in 965 and makes explicit reference to the Jews trading in the slave market there.40 The fourth route of the Radanites was the only one which would bring them to the slave emporia of Europe, and it was probably this fact which determined the choice of this alternative route, so much more hazardous than the other three which proceeded directly to Mahommedan countries.4' But that route, "(from the land of the Franks) behind Rome and passing the country of the Slavs," was one which had been trodden before recorded Jewish history in Europe by generations of nameless Jews in pursuit of their trade.

THE BLOCKING OF THE TRADE ROUTES The rise of Islam, its extension along the whole of the North African littoral and to the north coast of the Mediter- ranean by occupation by its devotees of Spain and Sicily42 37 Caro, i. p. 133. 38 ibid. 39 J.

Jacob, Arabische Berichte ton Gesandten an Germanische Furstenhofe aus dem 9 und 10 Jahrhundert. 41 That Jews did, despite the prohibition, still deal from time to time in Christian slaves is shown by the fact that towards the end of the 11lth century the wife of a Polish Duke is praised for having ransomed Christian slaves from Jews. (Regesten 169). The prohibition was of course due to the Jewish law requiring such slaves to be converted. 42 831-1090. Cf. Enc. Britt. 13th ed. Vol. 25 pp. 21-3. 260</page><page sequence="11">ROUTES OF RADANITES-RABINOWITZ had a disastrous effect upon trade communications between Christian Europe and the East. The western portion of the Mediterranean was completely blocked.43 Piracy, which had been put down by the Romans flourished anew, and trade was impossible. Two routes connecting Europe with the Orient still stood open, the one via Venice to the Levant and to Constantinople, the other, a more perilous route, via Flanders, across Europe to Russia, down the Dnieper to Constantinople, or via the Volga to Baghdad.44 There is however one fundamental difference between these routes and the routes of the Radanites. Both the Levant and Constantinople were in Moslem hands and no Chris- tian merchant could travel through them. "Christendom was excluded from the Eastern Seas and had to buy silks and spices of the Muslims at Alexandria and Aleppo. Thus the principal trade of the world in the middle ages came to be conducted in two separate compartments. The goods went through, but not the men."44a If, however, the account of the Radanites can be relied upon, it was not only the goods, but the men also who went through, and the immense profits inherent in this elimina- tion of the middlemen can well be imagined. The otherwise exaggerated statement of Jacobs that the disappearance of the Radanite trade left the Jews with that immense capital which enabled them in subsequent centuries to become the bankers of Europe,45 may well be within the realms of probability. 43 This has been brilliantly shown by Pirenne in Charlemagne et Mahomet and Medieval Cities, their Origins and the Revival of Trade tr. Halsey, Princetown, 1925. 44 Travel and Travellers in the Middle Ages. London, 1926.

We may perhaps ignore Pirenne, since he himself appears to have changed his view as to the negligible part which he previously main- tained the Jews took in international trade.50 46 Meyendorf, see below. 47 Pirenne. See note 50. 48 Heyd. see later. Also Jacobs, op. cit., but slightly exaggerated. 49 Baron, see later. 50 It appears that between the publication of his Medieval Cities in 1925 and his "Economic and Social History of Aedieval Europe" in 1936, he became aware of the existence of the Radanites, which caused him considerably to modify the views expressed in the earlier work as to the negligible part played by the Jews in international commerce in the time of Charlemagne. In the former work he continually disparages it as of no consequence, e. g., "the sporadic trade which Jews... still carried on during the Carolingian era was too feeble, and was too effectively discouraged by the invasions of the Norsemen and Saracens" p. 110 et alia. In the latter work he writes, "Thus we seek in vain for professional merchants. None existed, or rather none but the Jews who alone, from the beginning of the Carolingian era, carried on a regular commerce, so much so that the words Judaeus and mercator appear almost synonymous ... They were the Radanites" pp. 11-12. 262</page><page sequence="13">ROUTES OF RADANITES-RABINOWITZ The champion of the Radanites is W. Heyd.51 He accords them full credit for their activity in keeping open the otherwise blocked channels of international trade, points out in corroboration that Ibn Khordadbeh certainly was correct when he wrote that one of the routes to China was identical with that given by Suleyman, a marchande arabe'2 for the Chinese merchants. Heyd says that Ibn Khordadbeh was further correct when he wrote that from Spain to China there were communities of Jews in an uninterrupted chain where the Radanites could get all the necessary information,53 and that the prosperity of the Jews in Europe during the Carolingian era was certainly very great and could be ascribed to these vast commercial trans- actions. Heyd is roundly taken to task by Meyendorf54 for several assumptions. At first sight it would appear that Meyendorf gives due weight to the important part played by Jews in the international commerce of the period under review by him. In addition to his rather colorless introductory statement, "besides the travels of the pilgrims, the Vikings and the Arabs in our period, there were two other types of travellers who added considerably to the knowledge of the world among the Western peoples, namely the Jews, among whom Benjamin of Tudela may be considered the most prominent...,"55 he makes the much more positive state- ment, "the conflux of people of various nationalities at Alexandria, Baghdad, Damascus...." in comparatively s5 Op. cit., pp. 125 et seq. see also p. 30. 52 But see note 121. 53 He quotes this as proof that they might have been Occidentals, not Orientals. Much more to the point is the assistance which they could get from this chain of communities. See Section VI. 54 Travel and Travellers Chap.

He added, "This is, as it were, confirmed by ... the variety of countries where the Jews were domiciled.'"6 He fails to carry this to its logical conclusion howeverS7 because of his insistence on the impossibility and absurdity of free movement of Jewish traders" under the conditions of universal warfare prevailing between 800 and 1200, espe- cially in the Eastern half of Europe,"58 and he makes the following curious criticism of Heyd: "The historian often tries to operate with a very few general and preconceived assumptions derived from his own experience and general observation. Thus Heyd, the historian of the trade of the time makes the rather surprising assumption that the Jews during the internecine wars among the Christians were circulating freely among the warring peoples without arousing suspicion, and were consequently making large profits. This advantage of the extra-territorial position of the Jews Heyd apparently derives from his observation of modern, even of very recent, and apparently temporary and sporadic conditions of toleration."59 Quite apart from the fact that Heyd, far from "making an assumption" is quoting a document of undoubted and unimpeachable authenticity, and if we ignore his strange statement of the extra-territorial advantage possessed by modern Jews of s6 Ibid. p. 122. 57 It is not clear whether Meyendorf is referring to the Jewish com- munities of these places mentioned. But the existence, as well as the importance for our purpose, of the Jewish communities of Alexandria, Baghdad, Itil (capital of Khazaria), Prague and Ratisbon is amply referred to in this article. 58 p. 109. As has been shown (see note 31) it was only the needs of the slave trade which brought them to Eastern Europe. 59 P. 106. 264</page><page sequence="15">ROUTES OF RADANITES-RABINOWITZ twenty years ago, the charge of basing his assumptions on the observation of modern conditions can surely be levelled against the critic! He has obviously fallen into the error of applying the conditions of what one may inaccurately but conveniently term "totalitarian" war to the conditions of the 8th and 9th centuries. War in those days was largely confined to professional soldiers with sometimes only slight dislocation of ordinary civilian pursuits and of trade.60 Lastly6i comes Baron,62 at the other extreme from Meyen- dorf, he sees in the very separation of the world into two compartments the golden opportunity for a veritable monopoly of international Jewish commerce. "But now a new stimulus was given to Jewish commerce by the rigid separation between East and West," he says. Not only were cultural and economic demands of the West mounting, but the eastern lands suffered from a dire shortage of labor. In short, "a class mediating between the two elements was bound to arise" and the Jews were that class. Baron also makes the point that the Syrians, who until then shared the international trade with the Jews63 were, as Moham- medans, no longer able to function, and that the field was left clear to their rivals.64 IV.

That a Jewish merchant could range at will, with the same freedom as the Moham- medan from Spain to Baghdad, and from Baghdad to India, cannot be seriously disputed. Nor, despite Meyendorf's reference to the warring nations, can it be doubted that inside Christian Europe Jewish merchants could and did ply and sell their wares from France to Bohemia and to Italy. All that one has to concern oneself with therefore, is the possibility of these merchants being able to traverse the boundaries of Christian Europe and the Mohammedan world at some or any of the following points: - Christian France to Mohammedan Spain: Christian Italy to Moham- medan North Africa, and generally from Europe to Pales- tine and on to Baghdad. Once that possibility is established as a fact every objection to the existence or the activity of the Radanites is automatically removed. Nor need we, in this instance, confine ourselves to the immediate period of the Radanites. The conditions which obtained in the world in the 9th century continued unbroken and un- disturbed, except for minor variations, until the Tartar conquest of the 13th century. "Islam, the hereditary foe of Christendom, lay like a wall between Europe and the trade routes to the East."65 Proof therefore that at any time during these centuries of division, Jewish mer- 6s See the whole interesting passage from which this quotation is taken in Travel and Travellers in the Chapter "Routes to Cathay" by Eileen Power.

The evidence of such passage is overwhelming, both for the period when the Radanites flourished and for the subsequent centuries of world division. From the time of the Carolingians, who were contemporaries of the Radanites, down to the end of the Mahommedan and subsequently of the Mahommedan-Turkish66 stranglehold on international communications we have a continuous stream of evidence as to the complete freedom with which Jews, traders, travellers and scholars passed from Christian to Mahommedan lands and vice-versa. There is no doubt that in the Carolingian era the services of the Jews were courted and sought just for this reason. The famous embassy of Charlemagne to Haroun-al-Raschid headed by67 the Jew Isaac, the historicity of which has been unjustly impugned in some quarters68 furnishes a mine of information on this point. The deaths of the two Christian members of the embassy, Landfried and Sigis- mund, although the circumstances of their death are not detailed, would almost suggest the greater impunity which attended the Jew. The length of the journey, four years, reflects the conditions and circumstances of travel at the time; and the route taken on the return journey, from North Africa to Portovenere, near Spezia, and then across the Alps, is of surpassing interest, filling in as it does the one gap in Ibn Khordadbeh's otherwise comprehensive network of Radanite routes,69 and following the recognized old 66 Ibid. 67 That the account which makes Isaac the head, and not merely the interpreter, of the party is the correct one, is shown by Caro 1.129 and note p. 470. 68 Comp.

It may well be, however, that Arabs referred by this name to the whole 267</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW trade route mentioned above. In the same way the route from Baghdad to North Africa followed in reverse the third route of the Radanites, but that route continued along the African coast to Morocco and thence to Spain. As will be shown, we have ample evidence of the use of the route by which Isaac brought the elephant70 to Aix-la-Chappelle for Jewish travellers. So the anecdote of the Jewish merchant "who often visited Palestine," who was used by Charlemagne to play a trick on a credulous bishop, though only an anecdote, affords us a vivid and authentic picture of the activity of Jewish merchants, their methods, and the enormous prices they could command for exotic articles obtainable through no other source.7' For our purpose, however, its main interest is in the casual reference to the frequent visits of a Jewish merchant at the Court of Charlemagne to Mohammedan Palestine. The evidence as to Jewish shipowners will be dealt with later. There are three charters extant given by Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, to Jewish merchants. One of them is to a Spanish Jew, Abraham of Saragossa, prividing clear evidence of the second, and most obvious "ferry," that of the third route of the Radanites, via France and Spain. Moreover, as Caro points out72 it differs from the charters given to Christian merchants just in those ele- ments in which the needs and provision of international commerce figure. For instance, freedom from all travel imposts is specifically mentioned. There is also a reference to Judas Hebraeus, a member of an embassy from Barcelona of Christian Europe. Cf.

That inexhaustible storehouse of medieval documents, the Cairo Genizah, affords us many examples of the constant, normally accepted transit of Jews from Europe to Mahommedan countries. In one document76 a Spanish community recommends a French Jew who had lost his fortune to the benevolence of Cairo Jewry. Another frag- ment, published by Hirshfield77 gives an astonishing pic- ture of this to-and-fro movement in the first half of the 11th century. A Jew Moses, called Ibn Amram, son of Jacob Al-Qabisi, pleads his cause before the Beth Din of Kairouan. His father Jacob had died in Sicily, his father's brother Sahlun in Alexandria. His mother Jamama came from Marseilles. His brother Joseph had resided in Tripoli, but at the relevant period was in Egypt. Moses himself had lived in Sicily!78 The following century shows no abate- ment of this traffic. Among the letters of Abraham, son of Maimonides, is one in which a French Jew Joseph b. Gershon, Dayyan at Alexandria complains that another Dayyan had attacked not only him, but all French Jews, 73 Ibid. Note 111. p. 471. 74 See note 40. 7s Op. cit. 323. 76 Ibid. 77JQR. (O. S.) viii.

And thus, with the exception of Marseilles all the places mentioned were under the rule of Islam. But the Mediterranean had still to be crossed. 269</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW on account of their anthropomorphic conception of God.79 It would exceed the limits of this article to deal in detail with the cogent evidence provided by the famous and almost contemporary Jewish travellers Benjamin of Tudela (1165-1173) and Petahia of Ratisbon (1170-1187), both of whom passed between Christian and Mohammedan lands.8? The following points may be made in brief, how- ever. There is nothing in their accounts to suggest that they thought they were unique or that they were doing anything exceptional. They are known to posterity because of the fact that they wrote diaries (Petahia's was even written for him). There must have been many travellers and traders who were not so gifted in 'a literary way! Were it an exceptional journey, the arrival of two European Jews in Baghdad within one decade would surely have caused a sensation, and we should have expected Petahia's account to have some reference to the fact that another European Jew had been in Baghdad and the other places visited by both. This is admittedly an argumentum a silentio. Not so is his statement that "it is customary there (in Nineveh) that when a travelling Jew dies the sultan takes half of his property"8' which certainly suggests a frequency of Jewish travellers through the town, a key- point in East-West communications. He mentions the transition from Christian to Mahommedan countries in the most offhand manner possible. "R. Petahia passed into the land of Togarma. From thence and further on, people believe in the law of Mahomet."82 It would be 79 D. Simonsen, "Maimoniana" in Guttman, Festschrift pp. 210-224. Comp.

Lastly, and this is surely decisive, during the visit of Petahia83 Palestine was in the hands of the Crusaders, and he passed safely and unevent- fully from Baghdad to Damascus and on to Palestine. Of the position of Christian merchants under these conditions, Power writes:84 "In Palestine and Syria the Christians still held a remnant of the Crusading States with a valuable row of ports, and by treaty with the Sultans at their back- door were allowed to travel a few miles inland to the busy cities of Aleppo and Damascus. But beyond that, to the great mart of Baghdad, the centre of the whole district, and along the trade routes of the Persian Gulf, they might not go." The matter is clinched by Petahia's explicit statement8s that the authority of the Head of the College of Baghdad, Samuel, was acknowledged in the Land of Israel. As Benisch points out,86 although the political connection between Palestine and Babylon was severed, the religious union of the Jews, (with the contact which it implied) still continued. In short, neither Petahia nor Benjamin blazed a trail. They were normal Jewish trav- ellers following recognized trade routes which took them without incident from Christian Europe to the Mahom- medan world. One more aspect of this question should be studied, especially as there has been a tendency to neglect it. This is the "communication of ideas," the steady and constant flow of the products of Jewish scholarship between Babylon and Europe. This manifested itself in two forms, the sending of Quaestiones from the communities in Europe to the Geonim in Babylon, and the Responsa thereto, and 83 Ibid., Note 37, p. 85. Adler p. 64. 84 Op. cit. p. 122. 85 P. 19. 86 See note 83. 271</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the rapid dissemination of rabbinical literature from one extreme to the other. Postal services, of course, did not exist; that these documents were sent by hands other than Jewish is inconceivable, with the result that the mere receipt of a question in civil law, ritual etc., in Babylon, from Europe or the arrival of a scholarly work from one centre to the other definitely presupposes its transport by a Jew. I ignore the lively correspondence which existed between Kairouan in North Africa and Babylon for over two centuries,87 or the mission of Chasdai ibn Shaprut to Babylon for copies of the Talmud,88 since these countries are within the confines of the Mahommedan world, nor can one rely upon the romantic story of the "Four Cap- tives" whose authenticity is alternately challenged and re-established,89 but I confine myself to scholarly contacts between Christian Europe and the lands of Islam. One or two only of the Geonic Responsa need be referred to. Among the fragments from the Geniza published by Ginzberg90 are two which have a bearing on our subject. One9' preserves a question sent to Hai Gaon from Barco in Italy (as the use of anno mundi instead of the Seleucid era shows). In this case however, there is an element of doubt, as it has been maintained that Barco is in Egypt.92 87 Poznanski's Men of Kairouan Warsaw 1909 and Levin's "The Community of Kairouan during the Geonic Period" in Jubilee Volume to Rabbi M.

Kalonyo- rhos, one of the founders of Jewish learning in Europe towards the end of the 10th century, to the Geonim Sherira and Hai. "Our fragment establishes the fact beyond a doubt," comments Ginzberg, "that Italian and French scholars stood in correspondence with the Geonim of Babylon." In the 13th century R. Meir of Rothenberg indicates the route taken, with his reference to "Responsa which were brought from Africa, in which they enquired of the Geonim of Babylon,"94 while Natronai Gaon refers to "distant countries like France and Spain."95 So with books. Rashi's familiarity with the "Mah- bereth" of Menahem ibn Saruk, and the work of Dunash ibn Labrat of Fez is well known,96 while ready reference is available of his familiarity with geonic literature.97 To give but one final example. The works of Saadia Gaon, 892-942 are quoted by nearly all the Franco-German authorities as early as the 11th century.98 The conclusion is overwhelming and irresistible. The Jews, throughout all the centuries of the world division between Christianity and Islam did, without any doubt, pass safely on their lawful missions through every country. V.

Sir T. W. Arnold deals with a similar point with relation to Arab travellersI?O and his words may be applied almost without alteration to the Jews. "The journey of the Muslim traveller was facilitated by the brotherhood of Islam, which gave to the Muhammedan world its composite character. However many hundreds of miles the Muslim might travel from his native town he could confidently hope for a welcome and generous hospitality at the hands of his coreligionists, especially if he had any reputation for piety or religious knowledge"102 That the same welcome was afforded to the Jewish traveller at the hands of his coreligionists is equally certain,103 and in addition he was helped on his way by letters of recommendation from one community to the other. The safe conduct given to Petahia by Samuel, head of the Academy,--there being no Exilarch during his visitIo4- acted as a charm, "The people did all he required, and feared him."Ios The second facility was the use of a common language.

One can see here a reflection of the fact recorded in Peta- hia's statement "Chazaria has a language of its own, Togarma has a language of its own, Kedar has a language of its own."109 One last circumstance is of especial interest, but it concerns only one of the four routes of the Radanites, the last, and will be examined in detail in a subsequent article which aims at an analysis of the four routes. It was the existence, during the period of their activity, of the Jewish kingdom of the Khazars through which the Radan- ites passed. VI. THE TRANSPORT OF COMMODITIES How did the Radanites transport their commodities? As far as land routes are concerned, the question does not raise much difficulty. Pack-animalsII and waterways were the recognized means of transport, with the natural result that articles of great bulk hardly figure in the international commerce of the Middle Ages. Slaves were of course "self-propelled" and furs were the bulkiest articles carried. As in the case of all commerce of the Middle Ages, the chief Io6 Comp. Baron, op. cit. i. 322.

Adler, Jewish Traveller in China etc. 275</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW commodities, spices, were distinguished alike by their small bulk and the fantastic prices which they commanded."' The difficulty arises, however with regard to sea transport in the Mediterranean. On what ships did the Radanites embark, and what ships sailed from Christian to Moham- medan ports? The question is baffling with regard to the first two routes, and it applies to all the instances of trans- Mediterranean travel cited above. I am not yet in a position to answer that question: it is possible that the ships hugged the northern coast of the Mediterranean as far as Greece, where the crossing was robbed of most of its perils. There is, however, one contribution which one can make, and that is the definite, if vague, references to the ships of Jews in the Mediterranean in the Carolingian era. HeydI2 and Caro"I quote the anecdote told about Charlemagne. One day some ships were espied on the banks of the river, in sight of one of the ports of Narbon- nese Gaul. A discussion took place as to its nationality. One group was of the opinion that they were the ships of Jewish merchants, but Charlemagne's keen eyesight rec- ognized them as those of Norman pirates. The individual charters of Louis the Pious make specific reference to free- dom for ships of the Jews. They-all point to the frequency of the ships of Jewish merchants at the time."4 At the other end of their long trail we have a statement somewhat earlier, that in the time of the Sassanides the Persian Jews became rich by sending merchant vessels through the Erythrean Sea to India,"5 and somewhat later we have the reference to the ship owned by "Ishaq, the Jew's son" of Oman."6 "' Comp.

CHINA All the routes of the Radanites, without exception, end in China, but so far no reference has been made to the existence of Jewish communities there in the time of the Radanites. The mention of Chinese Jews conjures up in our minds the romantic picture of the isolated Jewish com- munity of Kai-Feng-Fu, whose existence was not dis- covered until the 18th century and whose disappearance took place practially within living memory."7 Its isolation, however, was the result of the conditions prevailing after the Radanites ceased their activity, although for long after it still had contacts, as its liturgy shows, with Persian Jews."8 The picture of Jewish communities in China at the time of the Radanites, such as we have it, is however quite different. It is one of active, dynamic communities, in full communication with their brethren further West, and every- thing tends to show how "unisolated" they were. In "An Account written by two Mohammedan Travellers through India and China in 851,""9 it is stated that "Jews have settled in China from time immemorial" and that "many of them for the sake of riches and preferment have abjured their own religion."

VIII. THE PROVENANCE OF THE RADANITES Where did the Radanite merchants hail from? It is impossible to give a definite answer to this question, but there are various indications which help to put us on the right track. The ascription of the name Radanites to the town Rhaga in Persia is almost the sole reason given for suggesting a Persian origin, and the alternative and more acceptable derivation given above124 deprives it of its value. Practically the sole clue is suggested by HeydI25 who points out that the fact that all the routes without exception are made to start from the West presupposes a Western, European origin for these merchants. On the other hand, it is not essential to regard them as a group all resident in one centre. The languages which they spoke, "Arabic, Persian, Roman, the language of the Franks, Andalusians and Slavs" need not necessarily mean that they were a company of gifted polyglot linguists. A much more reason- able assumption is that they were an association of mer- 121 Heyd. i. p. 30. See in general the evidence collected by him in Vol. i.

If this view can be accepted, it gives us an entirely new picture, that of Jewish mer- chants from all the countries they traversed combining for the mutual interests of their trade. One or two points in the brief account of Ibn Khordadbeh would tend to support this view. On the return from the first route, the party split up, one half proceeding to Con- stantinople. There is no mention of the Radanites pro- ceeding further westwards, though it is possible that they linked up with those merchants who made the overland route via Khazaria, the fourth route. Again the introduc- tory words to the account of the third route, "the merchants that start from France and Spain" certainly suggest that some did not so start but were, so to speak, picked up en route. Such associations of merchants are not unknown in the Middle Ages. In Kairouan there was a definite law whereby merchants in one place could draw on the credits of mer- chants in other places in payment of their debts.126 At the beginning of the 12th century a Jew of Egypt, Abu Imram gave a power of attorney to another Jew surnamed "the candlestick-maker," to transact his business in Sicily and Morocco and to look after his landed property in Spain,127 while Adler republishes from the Cairo Geniza a fragment of the 13th century in which a Jew of India writes to his business correspondent in Cairo to send him 126 Baron, SRH i. 322. 127 JQR. xvi. 280.

The evidence of such an association being maintained by the Radanites is by no means conclusive, but the general conclusion at which we arrive is that beyond question these merchants represented the normal commercial ac- tivity of the Jews of their time. In a subsequent article it is hoped to subject their routes to a detailed analysis and to show that they followed the recognized trade routes of their day. 128 Adler, Jewish Travellers pp. 100-101. 129 "The Commerce Books of Heliot de Vesoul," REJ. viii. 161, ix. 213. 280</page></plain_text>
