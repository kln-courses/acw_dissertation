Although it is difficult to reconstitute this history completely, let me try  with the existing documents to give an account of the political, ethnic, and  religious elements that are the background of the Kimbanguist religion.  More often than not, when evoking the kingdom of Kongo, scholars tend  to refer to the linguistic area corresponding to the Kongo ethnic group. But  whenever they try to depict the different groups making up this kingdom,  it becomes clear that there were several kingdoms—including those of the  Kongo, Angola, Loango, Anzico, and Teke. The research by the Jesuit father  Joseph Van Wing in his Études ba- Kongo; by Georges Balandier on daily life  in the kingdom of Kongo from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries; by  Cuvelier and Jadin; and by Kabolo Iko Kabwita help build fuller knowledge  of the ethnic, political, and religious background of the kingdom of Kongo.1 The origin of this kingdom has been lost in the oral traditions. But, unlike  other African political systems, the kingdom of Kongo has benefited from  several written accounts left by European missionaries and other Western  explorers. According to a myth that became famous thanks to the writings of the  Italian explorer Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi (published in 1687), a man  </page> <page sequence="4"> 16   general background called Ntinu Wene, or Nimi Lukeni, the youngest son of the king of Bundu  (or Vundu, near the present-d ay city of Boma in the Democratic Republic  of the Congo), resented having to live under the authority of his elder broth- ers; he left his kinsmen to emigrate with a group of followers to a region  south of the Congo River. There, he mustered his men into an armed band,  which exacted a toll from anyone wanting to cross the river. Then, Cavazzi  wrote, “one day, he argued with his paternal aunt, who refused to pay the  demanded sum. He ripped her belly open, though she was pregnant. Out  of fear of his father’s wrath, Lukeni then settled down on the southern bank  of the river, where he founded the kingdom of Kongo after defeating a local  chief called Mambombolo.”2 This murder was the starting point of the gradual conquest of the ter- ritory that came to be known as the kingdom of Kongo. But the authority  of a king is not legitimate until he earns the support of both his subjects  and their (dead) ancestors, who rule the territory. The lands that Ntinu  Wene had conquered did not hold the remains of his ancestors. In the  Kongo system, the property of land is exclusively held by ancestors, and  it can be neither divided nor ceded; the living only benefit from the use  of it. Consequently, Ntinu Wene’s conquest of the territory represented a  violation of the sacred, vital link among the ancestors, the living, and the  land.3 It was outside of the initial society that he built a new kingdom and  subjugated it to his law. He imposed his authority by filling his subjects  with awe.4 Balandier wrote that three elements marked the nature of this newborn  kingdom.5 The first was sacred violence, which is the privilege of a double-  faceted monarch—a brutal and domineering person, yet also a righter of  wrongs and a peacemaker. Second, Ntinu Wene was considered to be the  inventor of the art of forging metals, thereby endowing his people with  weapons for waging wars and tools for agriculture. Third, he instituted a  court of justice that was both respected and feared. Beyond the brutal power exerted by Ntinu Wene lay another power based  on ancestor worship. If the observers of the early kingdom of Kongo are to  be believed, Lukeni, while conquering the Congo plateau territories located  around his city of Mbanza Kongo, was regarded as a foreign invader until  he had obtained the blessing of the ancestors guarding his new possessions.  He thus became interested in legitimizing his reign through a matrimonial  alliance with a woman from the lineage of the conquered Nsaku clan. The early history of the kingdom of Kongo, as described by most observ- ers, gives the picture of relentless ethnic warfare between populations from  </page> <page sequence="5"> europe in africa   17 Congo-Brazzaville Democratic Republic of Congo Angola 0         100 0   m i     0         1000    k  m     Map 1.

The boundaries that enclosed the ancient king- dom of Kongo are blurred due to its coexistence with other kingdoms and  because those kings often exaggerated their territories,6 but it was mainly  located in present- day Angola. The kingdom bordered the Atlantic Ocean  on its western boundary and spanned the Zaire River toward the Bateke  Plateaux to the east. Its northern boundary extended toward present-d ay  Gabon and its southern boundary beyond the Kwango River, totaling more  than 115,000 square miles. The kingdom never had one common govern- ment, but it shared a common civilization.7 As time went by, the invaders  merged with the natives, and together they formed a vast kingdom whose  splendor amazed the Europeans who arrived by the late fifteenth century.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 18   general background The kingdom of the Kongo is commonly divided into six provinces or main  territories: Mbamba, Soyo, Mpemba, Mbata, Mpangu, and Nsundi. Other authors claim that the territory was once inhabited by the Batswa  ethnic group—that is, the Pygmies, who now live in the forest regions of  the areas mentioned above—and that the Bakongo, coming in successive  migratory waves, took hold of the territory and enslaved them to build the  kingdom of Kongo and its capital city, Mbanza Kongo.8 The general trend nowadays is to describe the kingdom of Kongo  as having been composed of the three present-d ay countries of Congo-  Brazzaville, the DRC, and Angola. Actually, it was the king of the Bateke  people, known as the Makoko Teke, who gave the land of what is now  Congo-B razzaville to the explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, who was  acting on behalf of France in 1880. This allows us to infer that the land  belonged to the Bateke kingdom.9 Oral tradition does not give a specific date of birth for the kingdom  of Kongo; the only existing written sources date to the year the kingdom  became known to the Portuguese, who settled there from the 1490s. Fur- ther, the kingdom of Kongo left no tangible traces apart from remnants  of the Christianization period, such as the ruins of the old cathedral of  Mbanza Kongo, which remain to this day and hold a particular significance  for Kimbanguists, as I discuss below. Around the new kingdom, a num- ber of elements typical of oral traditions congregated, shaping a distinctive  political and religious worldview. It is also difficult to get a clear picture of the political nature of the  kingdom of Kongo, particularly as regards the relations between the king  and his subjects and their perception of him. How did the succession of  the monarch take place? Was it a dynastic or a democratic process? Only  through the remnants of sociopolitical structures observable in present-d ay  Congo and Angola can we infer what the kingdom of Kongo may have been  as a political entity. Historians have reached a consensus about the duality  of the kingdom’s political power, which seems to have been both temporal  and spiritual. The Kongo social universe, as the Congolese historian Kabolo  Iko Kabwita explained, is a tripartite community, consisting of God, the  ancestors, and the members living on their own soil. In Kongo tradition,  the king, who is mainly considered to be the head of a clan, is the repository  of traditional religion. That is to say, he is the priest of ancestor worship.10  The American anthropologist Wyatt MacGaffey clearly analyzed the nature  of such worship: </page> <page sequence="7"> europe in africa   19 In Kongo the important distinction lies between ordinary persons, of  any age, and those who exercise occult power (kindoki), including both  the dead and powerful living elders. In many instances such elders,  especially those initiated as “chiefs” were regarded as spirits (binzambi-  nzambi, “little gods”) and treated as cult objects, as containing some  extraordinary soul that could be constrained to produce extraordinary  effects, good or bad. Chiefs (sing., mfumu) were persons initiated to the  cult of a particular spirit on behalf of the groups they represented. . . .  Like other initiates, they incorporated attributes of the spirit whose  powers they mediated. . . . The dualism of chief and priest, the latter  clearly dedicated to local spirits responsible for weather and fertility, is  evident in accounts of the former Kingdom of Kongo.11 It may then be inferred that temporal power was also a matter of spiri- tual power, which was given by the “gods” or “ancestors.” In this sense, a  chief, and especially a king, was entrusted not only with the temporal care  of his subjects, but also with their protection by acting as a go-b etween with  Nzambi a Mpungu (literally, God Almighty). It was impossible for a person  not born into the clan or ethnic group to rise to the throne. To become the  ruler, the king or king-t o- be must have been born in the Kongo ethnic group. In traditional Kongo society, social organization is based on a minimal  unit, which is not the nuclear family but the lineage, that is, the whole  group of descendants of an ancestor, who is often known to them all, but  also has a mythical dimension. Lineage in Kongo society includes those  who live on the surface of the earth (the living), those who are below the  surface of the earth (the dead), and those who are not yet born. The line of  descent is the governing principle of the transmission of kinship. It deter- mines a more or less exclusive degree of affiliation within and between  groups of individuals sharing the same ancestor. In the Kongo cultural sys- tem, the line of descent is usually traced from a single parent, the mother: a  child is her or his mother’s and only belongs to her kin. The line of descent  is therefore matrilineal, and kinship ties are transmitted by females only.  Hence a male, unlike his sister, cannot transmit his kinship to his chil- dren—the latter are no kin to him, because they belong to their mother’s  kinship group. Yet all his nephews and nieces (the children of his sister) are  members of his kinship group. Since individuals belong to their mother’s kinship group, female chil- dren represent a real source of wealth, for they are the ones who perpetuate  </page> <page sequence="8"> 20   general background the clan. A man is considered to be the husband of the children’s mother,  but his physiological fatherhood is ignored, while the “social” father, the  children’s legal tutor, is actually his brother-i n- law. The matrilineal system  is not a matriarchy, giving the mother exclusive authority over her children.  In this system, women are just progenitors, while actual power inside the  family is in the hands of maternal uncles. The matrilineal system, which  is still recognized in modern Kongo society, determines who is entitled to  inherit from whom property rights, titles, and duties, and who transmits to  whom social identity and status. This does not mean that the head of a family or kinship group is nec- essarily a king or the head of the whole ethnic group—even though a king  may be the head of his family or kinship group or be a local chief for a  region or village. This is probably the way the king of Kongo identified,  since he ranked above the heads of all families and the heads of all kinship,  tribal, and ethnic groups and just under Nzambi a Mpungu. The order of  succession may have been systematically dynastic, as was the case for King  Nzinga Nkuvu, a descendant of the first Kongo king, Ntinu Wene/Lukeni.  In some cases, it was the council of elders that made decisions about the  succession or the nomination of a new sovereign, granting him legitimacy  by transmitting to him the relics of different sorts of ancestors, such as  albinos (believed to be reincarnations of the dead) or previous incumbents  of the office.12 The French anthropologist Albert Doutreloux’s discussion  of the “rod chief” (from the Kongo mvuala, “rod”) allows a better under- standing of one aspect of the authority of Kongo chiefs—and, by extension,  kings—over their people:  1.  When the chief travels and the mvwala is brought out, the members  of his clan must remain in their houses until the Children and  Grandchildren have passed. 2.  No member of the clan may touch the mvwala, for to do so would mean  he presumed to be chief. 3.  If the chief plants his mvwala in the market, everybody must sit down  and hear what he has to say. 4.  If the chief comes to confer a title, his mvwala will be planted in the  middle of the village until the investiture is over. 5.  Mvwala is to be kept next to the house post at all times.13 Below, I discuss the ways the kinship system and the mvuala, as defined  in the kingdom of Kongo, remain alive in, but are at the same time disrupted  </page> <page sequence="9"> europe in africa   21 by, the ideology of succession at work in the Kimbanguist Church. But first,  it is important to stress that, as the explorers Filippo Pigafetta and Duarte  Lopez remarked in 1591, “In the whole kingdom of Congo, absolutely no  one can claim to possess anything that he may freely dispose of or bequeath  to his heirs. Everything belongs to the king, who divides charges, valuables,  and lands as he deems fit. The king’s sons are themselves subject to this  law. For this reason, if anyone fails to pay him the annual tribute, the king  strips him of his power and gives it to another man.”14 This passage is particularly illustrative of the absolute nature of the  power wielded by the king over his subjects, collaborators, and sons. It is  also useful to note that the socially established values described by West- ern observers constructed a common law that regulated the principle of  primogeniture by requiring the submission of both younger brothers and  women, thereby delineating an essentially male hierarchy. The aim of this  subordination and dependency in social and family life was—and still is— to have women fulfill the roles of wives and mothers; depend on men for  their material, affective, and social security; and perpetuate the clan’s lin- eage by giving birth. Matrimonial alliances are also regulated by the common law, which  requires the payment of a dowry. This, as Balandier explained, establishes  the distinction between the legitimate wife, on the one hand, and the con- cubine or the (purchased) female slave, on the other. The dowry payment  involves a ceremony that reveals the role of the young bride’s brother  through the “option” he takes on his sister’s future children, who will have  judicial and sentimental ties to him.15 The kingdom of Kongo is a foundation for the Kimbanguist religion, which  builds its work of identity reconstruction on that kingdom and its civiliza- tion, with its distinctive religious and cultural worldview. While differing  from the moral code of European missionaries, the Kongo moral code and  respect for hierarchy included two types of sanctions. A negative sanction  might have been meted out to offenders, based on the condemnation of  certain actions regarded as vices—namely, adultery, theft, homosexuality,  and pedophilia.16 Positive sanctions were like a good neighbor policy with the ancestors,  since infringement on a taboo could cause their wrath. Here, morality was  essentially social and knew neither of a Judgment Day nor of any notion  of retribution; a purgatory was totally absent from Kongo representations  of the hereafter. The Kongo conception of death and the hereafter derived  </page> <page sequence="10"> 22   general background from a spiritual domain that is usually designated as animism: “Animism,  strictly speaking, attributes a vital force or soul (anima in Latin, hence its  name) to all elements in the world; it therefore involves worshiping the  spirits and all the invisible beings endowed with personalities, wills, and  powers, and also ancestor worship, which implies a belief in the notion that  souls are independent from bodies and liberated by death.”17 A number of elements delineate the content of traditional Congolese  beliefs, which never aimed to be universal, since only tribe members are  allowed to worship. The first structural feature is the belief in a maker, known  as God Almighty in each vernacular language (here, Nzambi a Mpungu).  This belief is found in many traditional African religions, and God’s action is  understood to coexist with the interventions of intermediary, more approach- able deities and tribal ancestors. For the French Africanist Jean-C laude Fro- elich, the fact that archaic peoples had the concept of a single maker is an  indicator that the belief is extremely ancient.18 Today, Kimbanguists still pray  to the God of the Bible under the name Nzambi a Mpungu. The second element that characterizes Congolese animism is the belief  in invisible, more or less anthropomorphic spirits, which haunt springs,  rivers, rocks, and forests. Froelich classified them into two categories: half-  mythological, half- divine beings inhabiting trees and caves in human or  animal guise, and local spirits, who serve God and inhabit the earth like  human beings, but who are invisible and much more powerful than the  former and are in direct contact with human beings. This aspect of ani- mism is recognized in the Kimbanguist Church, but it is combated as evil,  as I discuss below. The third essential feature of Congolese tribal religions is ancestor wor- ship, which is linked to beliefs about life in the hereafter. According to these  beliefs, every human being is endowed with a soul, which either leaves the  body after death to continue living in the invisible world of the ancestors  or is reincarnated in his or her own family—especially if the deceased was  a young person. Old people who die after a virtuous life become ancestors,  whom their descendants worship with sacrifices and offerings of alcoholic  beverages. The bankulu (plural of nkulu, “elder”) are the dead members of a  clan. The land is their realm; they inhabit the woods and rivers, where they  live in perfect harmony in villages similar to those of the living.19 Ancestors sometimes morph into deities—when they have become more  remote through the succession of generations of their descendants. Para- doxical though it may seem, an ancestor may at the same time be consid- ered as reincarnated and still be worshiped at his or her grave, as Froelich  </page> <page sequence="11"> europe in africa   23 pointed out: “an impalpable part of his being, the consciousness of his self,  survives somewhere in the realm of the dead.”20 Today, the Congolese still  worship ancestors by paying tribute to the dead members of their families:  it is a common sight in Congo on the feast of All Saints Day (November 1)  to see people in cemeteries talking to their dead, settling old scores with  them, or thanking them for their protection. As I discuss below, the Kongo  belief in reincarnation is clearly recognizable in the Kimbanguist dogmas  on the incarnation of the Holy Spirit and the Second Coming of Christ. While, as Froelich pointed out, the notions of chastisement and reward  seem absent from a moral system essentially based on social values, Bal- andier showed that the end of the trip is the realm of the ancestors and the  goal is to obtain a “lasting life.” The dead are the “living par excellence”; they  are outside of time and wealthy; they have power that allows them to con- trol nature and human beings. From their villages underneath riverbeds or  the floors of lakes, they can go out to mingle with the living (without being  seen) and tamper with the order of things.21 Witchcraft and anti- witchcraft are also important components of ani- mism. These twin but antagonistic forces are revealed through the witch  and the anti-w itch, who inspire, respectively, distrust and trust. According to  the social beliefs held by tribal people and by Congolese people, the witch is  the person who spreads fear because his or her supernatural powers allow  him or her to cause death or madness, attract thunder and unleash thunder- bolts, make women barren, or spread epidemics. Anything out of the ordi- nary can be blamed on witchcraft. Based on anthropological observation in  the region, the witch (ndoki) is purported to shape-s hift and can live “in the  guise of a human being or animal, and dissolve the boundaries of nature.”22 On the contrary, the anti- witch (nganga) is able to control the actions of  the former: identifying the source of disease or misfortune, repairing what  has become paralyzed, and healing the witch’s victims and those made sick  by him or her. The anti- witch enjoys social recognition as the counselor,  the protector, the healer who provides fetishes, and, most important, the  fighter of witches. The nganga’s influence on individual destinies cannot  be overestimated.23 One might assume that this logic of antagonistic forces ruling the lives  of Congolese people has totally disappeared nowadays, but nothing is fur- ther from the truth. The opposition between the witch and the anti-w itch  is still at work in Congolese social representations, and it does not seem to  have been substantially modified by modernity. As the Congolese historian  Martial Sinda pointed out, “Witchcraft has ramifications even in the cities  </page> <page sequence="12"> 24   general background that are home to Africans with a European education. To this day, witch- craft, which causes actual panic in this milieu, remains far more formida- ble than any other misfortune.”24 Even before Christianization, witches were already identified as the dev- il’s minions, known in the Kikongo language as kadiapempa. This notion  was further reinforced by exposure to the Manichaean opposition of God  and evil. However, the role of the anti-w itch today seems to be yielding  ground to both European rationalism and the tremendous success of  preachers- cum- exorcists trained in American-s tyle holiness churches,  which have mushroomed since the 1990s in Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Still,  among Kimbanguist believers, it is forbidden to resort to either witches or  anti- witches. Another feature of traditional Congolese beliefs was the system of initia- tion, which was a form of socialization of young men and women, helping  them to internalize the norms and beliefs specific to the Kongo group. By  keeping the members of a given age group secluded from the rest of the  community for the period of time dedicated to their initiation, this system  functioned as a school where rights and duties were made clear and obliga- tions were explained. It may also be compared to a church, in which young  men and women were inculcated with core beliefs about their relations to  the universe and particularly to supernatural beings. In the kingdom of  Kongo, a well-k nown rite of passage was kimpassi, which was recorded by  many chroniclers and observers.25 The local masters of kimpassi—led by a  woman, the ngudi nganga—were in charge of conducting the rituals: teach- ing the novices in an outdoor shed far from the village and making sure the  young men and women complied with their new rules of conduct. The initiation ritual took place in three phases. First, the novices went  through a symbolic death: stripped of their clothes, lined up like corpses,  bound by a pact, they were carried into the shed to be rebirthed by Ma  Ndundu (Mother Albino). Then, each of the “newborns” took part in the  specific kimpassi dance, recited the pledges of allegiance, and chose his  or her initiation name. Their training in civic values and ritual practices,  as well as the learning of secret languages, could then begin. Finally, after  months or years of ordeals, the initiates could return home, where they  were greeted with demonstrative celebrations and presents. Kimpassi most  probably played a part in the struggle against Portuguese colonization, for  the missionaries perceived it as a major obstacle.  Beyond kimpassi, the education of community members was based on  narratives, proverbs, and songs explaining the meanings of names and  </page> <page sequence="13"> europe in africa   25 mottoes. In addition to this oral literature, which buttressed religious and  political authorities, there were “revealed texts” (transmitted by the spirits,  the ancestors, or the dead), formulas and prayers, and songs facilitating  communication with Nzambi a Mpungu and the ancestors. It seems that  the Kimbanguist Church’s spiritual retreats and renaming processes may  be traced back to the tradition of kimpassi, since the inspired hymns of  Kimbanguism reflect the supernatural relation between human beings and  the angels or the departed, sending them spiritual messages. Human beings’ relation to time was part of what may be called the tra- ditional calendar. Indeed, in the kingdom of Kongo, there were not seven  days, but four: Nkandu, Konzo, Nkenge, and Nsona. Each of these four  days was associated with social and religious rituals: Nkenge and Nsona  were the days of the ancestors and of resurrection, while Nkandu and  Konzo were associated with the transmigration of souls.26 It is clear that the Congolese system of beliefs and values starkly differed  from those of Europe, although some Western explorers were capable of  appreciation and enthusiasm about its level of “civilization.”27 But eventu- ally, after centuries of colonization, the traditional Congolese system was  destroyed by Christianization, schooling, and urbanization, which pro- foundly disrupted the social and religious organization of Kongo society.28 Christianity aims to be a universal religion, and European missionaries  assumed it was their calling to convert all non- Westerners, without ques- tioning the nature of their “heathen” beliefs. But from the outset, mission- aries were confronted with an epistemological issue. Were non-E uropeans  able to become Christians? The question was first raised after the begin- ning of the colonization of the New World, where the indigenous peoples  of the Americas were seen as devoid of souls and therefore impossible to  Christianize. From the mid- 1510s to his death in 1566, the Dominican friar  Bartolomé de Las Casas argued Aquinas’s theological assertion that society  is part of nature and hence all societies, whether Christian or pagan, are  equally endowed with dignity and legitimacy. His priority was to spare the  natives from further cruelty and slaughter on the part of the Spaniards.29 Las Casas’s insistence earned him the title of “defender of the Indi- ans,” awarded to him by Cardinal Cisneros as early as 1516. Paradoxically,  his acute concern with human dignity faltered when it came to the Afri- cans’ fate. Indeed, Las Casas suggested that the tragic depletion of the  indigenous West Indian population be compensated for by importing  slaves from Africa. From then on, sub-S aharan Africa and particularly the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 26   general background kingdom of Kongo became a reservoir for an enslaved human workforce.  Later, Las Casas recanted this position; his apologetic history of the Indies  testified that the ability to progress and to receive the message of Christ  belonged to all of humanity, for “all the races of the world are men.”30 Still,  it remained doubtful whether Africans could—or should—be evangelized,  for the Christianization of sub-S aharan Africa and particularly the king- dom of Kongo was irretrievably tainted by practices of oppression insepa- rable from it. Indeed, the Congolese territory officially entered history only after it was  “discovered” by the dominant Other. In 1482, the Portuguese navigator  Diogo Cão reached the mouth of the Congo River, on the coast of what  was to become Luanda, Angola. As early as 1484, the Portuguese created  trading posts along the Atlantic coast of the Congo and Angola. In 1575 they  founded São Paulo da Luanda, which became their main trading and mil- itary post. The conquest of Africa was seen as guaranteeing both salvation  and earthly bliss to those going there—soldiers, merchants, priests, all of  them colonizers. Today, because of a lack of primary sources, it is impossi- ble to relate precisely how the Congo was Christianized. It seems to have  been an uneven process with varying degrees of success from one region to  another and from one ethnic group to another.31 Still, it appears that sub-S aharan Africa, particularly the kingdom of  Kongo, was Christianized in two phases. The first occurred in the fifteenth  and sixteenth centuries and concerned mostly Portuguese colonies, such  as the kingdom of Kongo, and islands in the Atlantic Ocean, such as Cape  Verde, Principe, and São Tomé. The Portuguese were the first Europeans  who settled there after the existence of natives was publicized by the “dis- coverers.” Subsequently, the Christianization process involved many dif- ferent religious orders. Georges Balandier’s research shows how it was  launched over and over again, involving one Catholic monastic order after  another with little consistency. But ultimately, “the two centuries of Chris- tianization had very poor results, with a heavy toll in terms of sufferings  and human losses, due to either the climate or the journeys.”32 Hence, the complex history of the Christianization of Congo and Angola  shows the long- standing presence and influence of the Portuguese, until  the kingdom of Kongo was officially divided up among three European  powers at the Berlin Conference of 1884–85.33 This conference resulted  in what is commonly known as the General Act of Berlin, or the sharing  of Africa. The ancient kingdom of Kongo was partitioned by colonial pow- ers, which split its population among the so-c alled Belgian Congo (now the  </page> <page sequence="15"> europe in africa   27 Democratic Republic of the Congo), the French Congo (Congo-B razzaville),  and Angola. Territorial limits being set, there were now further encounters between  Christianity and traditional Kongo religion; the penetration of the three  Congos by Europeans went hand in hand with a modernizing mission,  which introduced not only market economics but also Roman Catholi- cism. The Berlin Treaty of 1885 was amended by the Convention of Saint-  Germain- en- Laye,34 which guaranteed freedom of religion and worship and  reaffirmed the right of all missionaries to enter, travel, and reside on the  African continent. While Christianization had often predated colonial pen- etration and occupation in many African countries, it was significant that  this act put all Christian churches on an equal footing, inviting them to  further compete for new converts. Colonial archives also show another form of religious orders dividing up  Africa. The key actor in this process was Cardinal Charles Lavigerie, who  founded the Society of Missionaries of Africa (aka the White Fathers) in  1868 and the order of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa in 1869.  The Holy See put him in charge of the apostolic delegation to Sahara and  Sudan, granting him the title of primate of Africa. In 1889–1890, in a con- text of competition with Protestant missionary societies, which had begun  gaining substantial ground in Central Africa, Lavigerie obtained permis- sion from King Leopold II of Belgium for an international conference in  Brussels on the abolition of slavery. An international treaty was signed both  to put an end to the slave trade and to protect all missionary communities  fighting against human trafficking. Lavigerie thus secured protection for  Catholic missions in Central Africa while associating the penetration of the  Catholic Church with the cause of civilization.35 The Berlin Conference thus ushered in the second phase of Christian- ization, marked by the free circulation of missionaries and the settlement  of missionary posts and institutions in all the countries delineated by the  Association internationale africaine. This new modus operandi for Chris- tianization further strengthened the ties between the missionary societies  and their home governments. Following the long-s tanding and unchanging policy of the Roman  church, any process of Christianization potentially entailed the construc- tion of a state, that is, a temporal structure. The Catholic Church had an  interest in politics and did not just send missionaries to Africa: the Holy  See dictated the carving of states out of Africa as it was gradually being  Christianized. The church, whose mission is to preach the gospel, remained  </page> <page sequence="16"> 28   general background closely associated with the colonial venture, but this was done on the con- dition that the church’s political action would not clash with the interests  of the imperial states of Europe. Christianization was not supposed to lead  to political empowerment of the natives. Evidence of this can be seen in  the following declaration by Pope Benedict XV, who reiterated in 1920 the  doctrine of separation between the Christianization of natives and their  politicization, which had been inaugurated in 1880: “When dealing with  the populations they are in charge of, the missions shall carefully banish  any idea of paving the way to a political awareness of their nationhood.  Hence they shall never meddle in any kind of political or temporal interests  of their own nation, or any other nation.”36 How did the Christianization of Africans effectively take place after the  Berlin Conference? How did Christian missionizing deal with questions  pertaining to ethnicity and African values and belief systems? From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, the missionary move- ment gained momentum with the founding of the Séminaire des missions  étrangères (Seminary of Foreign Missions) and missionary orders. Among  the leaders of this movement was Father François Libermann, who initiated  the first mass journey of missionaries to sub-S aharan Africa and founded  the Society of the Holy Heart of Mary, which eventually merged with the  Congregation of the Holy Spirit (or Spiritan congregation); he is often con- sidered to be one of the cofounders of the latter.37 Frequently named by his- torians of Cameroon are the German Pallottine father Herman Nekes and  the Spiritan father Alexandre Leroy, while scholars of Congo-B razzaville  and Gabon regularly mention Msgr. Prosper- Philippe Augouard, and schol- ars of Rwanda and Burundi discuss Msgr. Jean- Joseph Hirth. Famous Protestants include the explorers of the inland territories, such  as Dr. David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary and physician who was  instrumental in the promotion and expansion of the British commercial  empire, the Christianization of the southern countries of Africa, and the  fight against the slave trade.

George Grenfell was a British Baptist  missionary and explorer who spent thirty-t wo years of his life surveying  sub-S aharan Africa and founding missionary settlements, particularly in  Cameroon and Congo. Joseph Merrick, a Baptist pastor hailing from Jamaica, is considered to  be the first Black missionary; in 1843 he tried to found the first Christian  Baptist mission among the Duala people of Cameroon. In spite of his  failure in this attempt, “the ideology of negritude, which was then in the  making in the British West Indies, may take pride in the fact Blacks were  </page> <page sequence="17"> europe in africa   29 Christianized by other Blacks. Yet, these mixed-r ace Jamaican literati  were considered to be ‘Whites’ and were called by this name among the  people of the coast of Cameroon.”38 This hampered their initiative, which  was later stopped by the standards defined by the Berlin Conference. Pas- tors William Holman Bentley and Thomas Comber, both members of the  Baptist Missionary Society, settled in the Belgian Congo. Their accom- plishments included the Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language,  published in 1887. When Comber passed away that year, Bentley settled  in Ngombe Lutete in Lower Congo, where he “devot[ed] his linguistic  expertise to the translation of the New Testament into Kikongo, which  was completed in 1893. He also translated Genesis, Proverbs, and part of  the Psalms.”39 Thus, in the southern part of the Belgian Congo—the future birthplace  of Kimbanguism—the Baptist Missionary Society had already put down  roots before the Catholic missions arrived, and this was a source of ten- sion. As a result of this competition, Christian missions moved inland,  far from urban areas, which proved to be a key factor in their methods of  Christianization. The two main methods implemented by Western missionary societies  to penetrate Africa and found settlements were, first, gaining the trust of  local chiefs and kings, and second, creating schools for the education of  the natives. Western missionaries actually invented the figure of the local  chief, an authority they established in parallel with preexisting traditional  chiefs. Sporting their medals, the local chiefs were often in conflict with  the traditional chiefs, whose voices conveyed a sense of continuity with the  precolonial system of values and beliefs, independent from the colonial  power structure that had bestowed honors on their rivals. Under such cir- cumstances, the medal-b earing chiefs and their conversions to Christianity  were essential in the process of development of missions in sub- Saharan  Africa, and these chiefs were the most commonly mentioned by colonial  ethnographers.40 In Cameroon, for instance, the princes had a vested inter- est in relying on the White man and his God, which were of great import in  a world centered around a keen sense of antagonistic forces, social prestige,  and awe toward invisible powers.41 This is how a new elite, composed of catechists, bilingual assistant  teachers (known as moniteurs), and medal- bearing chiefs emerged as an  intermediary category between White missionaries and the majority of  natives. This native elite was complicit with the Christianization process,  the expansion of missions, and the wider colonial order. The intrusion of  </page> <page sequence="18"> 30   general background Christianity thus entailed profound transformations of the social and polit- ical systems, both of which were closely linked to religion.42 In this context, Christianization went hand in hand with the preserva- tion of the political order. King Nzinga Nkuvu, a descendant of the first  Kongo king, Ntinu Wene/Lukeni, converted to Roman Catholicism and  was baptized as Afonso I (aka Joaõ I). This baptism was not a simple indi- vidual conversion, but a political act. According to the historian Luc Croe- gaert, personal baptism also entailed political calculations on the part of  African heads of state. Indeed, they saw it as a way to build alliances with  European powers and to thwart the plots of rival family members and their  allies.43 During the twenty years of his reign, King Afonso corresponded  regularly with the king of Portugal and requested the help of missionaries  to Christianize his kingdom. Starting in 1491, the year the Capuchins arrived in Kongo, the nation’s  religious landscape was transformed. At first, the North was scarcely  affected by Christianity, while other people were gradually Christianized.  In 1492 the church of Angola was born, and in 1518 Don Henrique, the son  of King Afonso, was consecrated as the first native bishop of sub- Saharan  Africa by Pope Leo X. Still, the king of Kongo did not outwit the colonizers; although convert- ing to Catholicism with his subjects meant placing his kingdom on the  international scene, it did not establish an independent Congolese church  outside of the grip of the Vatican and Europe. Although the king’s son was  a bishop, this never paved the way for other nominations of Congolese  men to the bishopric; Henrique remained the first and only Black bishop  in the kingdom of Kongo. After Henrique passed away in 1521, King Afonso  wanted two of his nephews to be granted the same title, but his efforts  were to no avail. The king of Kongo’s wish to appoint his own clergy was  rejected by the king of Spain, who appointed all members of the regular  clergy in São Salvador (the capital) and paid them. Even attempts by the  Jesuits to found seminaries in Congo at the time proved unsuccessful.44  And “in 1596, when King Álvaro II had won Vatican approval for Kongo to  have its own bishops at a cathedral in São Salvador, the crown of Portugal  had managed to squeeze the right to nominate bishops in the See of Kongo  and Angola from the Vatican.”45 Meanwhile, the Christianization process went on, relying on, besides  the conversions of chiefs and their subjects, schools and churches, which  were two inseparable institutions insofar as the moniteurs were usually  catechists as well. Regarding education, Croegaert stressed that “the priests  </page> <page sequence="19"> europe in africa   31 immediately acknowledged its importance and always considered it as the  bedrock of their missionizing work.”46 Indeed, through the school sys- tem, children were disciplined and (re)educated away from the traditional  value system, which the missionaries perceived as inherently pagan. Con- sequently, an actual social change was implemented in the confrontation  between the biblical values conveyed by Christian missionaries and the tra- ditional Congolese values. A Christian society emerged from the Congolese  people’s perception of the need to embrace European values and thus be  defined as “civilized” beings. While new values were being shaped out of the first contacts between  the dominant Whites and the subjugated Africans, the book as an object of  learning had a considerable impact on the subjectivities of Africans, as the  American theologian Vincent Wimbush pointed out in his analysis of the  narratives of enslaved Africans, particularly the famous Olaudah Equiano.47  The introduction of books, and in particular the Bible, elicited curiosity  among Africans, who, like Equiano, were used to oral traditions. Books  soon represented a locus of the secrets or magic of White men. Yet in the eyes of the dominant Other—the White man—was a Black  person really seen as a full- fledged Christian once baptized? How did West- ern missionaries perceive Black identity when reading and teaching the  scriptures? The Catholic and Protestant missionaries no doubt believed in their mis- sionizing work; they were primarily concerned with bringing salvation to  Africans by spreading the gospel among them. But what exactly did they  want to save them from? Colonial archives hold materials written by mis- sionaries that give clear indications of their perception of Black people.  In effect, the image that colonial missionaries had of Africans coincided  with the definition of pagans in Christian theology; it was based on a Man- ichaean opposition between good and evil, light and darkness, God and the  devil. This is reflected in the first catechism published in Kikongo in 1624  for the Kongo catechumens’ preparation for baptism: M[aster]. Why do you say, “By the grace of God”? D[isciple]. Because it is neither thanks to my own merits, nor those of  my father and mother or any other mortal creature that I have become  a Christian, but thanks to the goodness and forgiveness of God and  the merits of Christ. M. What dignity does man receive when he is made a Christian? D. He becomes the adopted child of God and an heir to Heaven. </page> <page sequence="20"> 32   general background M. And he who is not a Christian? D. He remains a cursed son, a slave to the Devil; he is cast out of  Heaven.48 In this theological worldview, human beings were either children of  God, once they had received a Christian baptism, or children of the devil,  if they had not been christened. They were children of the devil because  of original sin, which was said to bind all human beings as descendants  of Adam and Eve, until they were christened.49 When people got baptized  in the church, they went from darkness to light. When European mission- aries landed in Africa, of course, none of the natives had been baptized,  so every African was supposed to be under the influence of the devil. The  socially codified values of the kingdom of Kongo, described by early Euro- pean observers and condemned by White missionaries, became subsumed  under three significant social practices: polygamy, dancing, and the use of  fetishes. The first two were closely associated in the judgmental percep- tions of Kongo culture conveyed by missionaries.50 Consequently, Africans  had to be freed from sin through conversion to Christianity. But until then,  they were considered by their instructors to be children of the devil, pagan,  polygamous, fetish believing, animist, savage, and barbaric. But once baptized, were Africans—in this case, Congolese people— regarded as full Christians? This question was addressed by Kabwita, who  explained that Christian missionaries’ interest in the African continent,  particularly the kingdom of Kongo, was primarily spurred by economic  priorities. At a time when the triangular slave trade was by far the most  lucrative form of trade, the Catholic Church also possessed its own slaves to  ensure its financial self-s ufficiency.51 The enslaved captives, bound for the  Americas, had to be christened, but they received no religious education  prior to their baptism. Priests merely gave the future slaves a “simulacrum  of baptism,” that is, a collective baptism, for which the celebrant was paid  with a per capita tax. In reality, such christenings had no other function than increasing the  zone of influence of the Catholic Church and its secular allies in their  competition with Protestant kingdoms, then defined as heretical. This is  why first the government in Lisbon and then the Spanish administration  insisted that all captives be baptized.52 Therefore, although baptized, the Congolese who remained on the con- tinent were clearly perceived as incomplete Christians by a number of mis- sionaries. “In 1603, a missionary declared that Congo was totally ruined  </page> <page sequence="21"> europe in africa   33 where good morals were concerned and was Christian only in name.”53  Bishop Manuel Baptista Soares, who was known for his numerous excom- munications, wrote the following remarks about the Congolese in his 1619  report: “Christianity is so imperfect among them that the king himself has  official concubines. Among this numerous people, only very few regard  the vices of the senses as sins. Many among them take the title of defender  of the faith and send ambassadors to the courts of Rome and the Catholic  king. They do so out of vanity rather than a sentiment of zeal for religion.”54 However, a different assessment was given by other missionaries, such  as Father Liévin-B onaventure Proyart, who, in the last quarter of the eigh- teenth century, insisted that the Congolese people publicly professed a gen- uine attachment to the Catholic faith, though they lacked competent clergy  to exhort them and give them the sacraments.55 In 1906, Msgr. Henri  Vieter was eloquent when challenging his European audience’s assump- tions about African Christians: “See for yourselves. . . . There are many  black Christians who put some white people to shame. Many whites have  not done for Christ in their whole lifetime one-t enth of what blacks must  offer to be given baptism.”56 This brief historical overview of the religious experience of African Chris- tians shows to what extent Black people, even when baptized, were con- sidered to be second- class Christians who were members of the church  only as slaves or as statistics for competing missionary societies. From the  standpoint of European missionaries, Africans were christened either with- out their consent or in order to benefit from the charity work of the church,  which provided them with clothing, food, and medical care. Hence, for  Europeans, Africans remained “savages and barbarians, who were happier  under the yoke of Europeans than in the dire poverty and cruelty of their  despicable milieu.”57 The link between Christianization and ethnicity was  unbreakable in a worldview that assigned Africans to the lowest rung in the  hierarchy of human beings. Given this context, how did Africans perceive the religious messages that  were preached to them, particularly the Bible? What place did they assign to  the dominant Other, that is, the White man, in their own worldview? </page> </plain_text>
