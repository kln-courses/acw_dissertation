<plain_text><page sequence="1">REID'S INDEBTEDNESS TO BACON My intention in this paper is to remedy what may be regarded as an oversight with respect to the philosophy of Thomas Reid. It is well-known that Reid attempted to pursue his studies of the human mind according to the new method of induction and experiment. Unfortunately, when one en counters discussions of Reid's concept of science and method, it is Newton who usually holds the position of prominence. Francis Bacon, if he is men tioned at all, is hardly allowed to make an appearance. This emphasis on Newton is somewhat misplaced, and the primary aim of this paper is to restore Bacon to his proper place as the philosopher who most profoundly influenced Reid's notions of methodology and the science of mind. Before proceeding to the main sections of this paper, there are a few points of clarification which must be made. First, it is not my intention to deny that Reid's notion of science and method was influenced by Newton. However, we need to assess Newton's influence from the point of view of regarding Newton as a good Baconian. This is Reid's perspective. Indeed, there are only a few points on which Newton is said by Reid to have sur passed Bacon with respect to method. Second, Bacon's influence on Reid has not been totally neglected by Reid scholars in the twentieth century. Most notably, Professor Marcil-Lacoste has commented extensively on the influence of Bacon in Reid's development of his concept of common sense.1 In contrast, some scholars have not even mentioned Bacon when discussing Reid's concept of a science of mind. For instance, Norman Daniels fails to recognize this influence at all in his book on Reid's Inquiry, the one book of Reid's which shows most clearly the influence of Bacon.2 There are even passages in this work that sound as if they were written by Lord Verulam. Of course, the difficulty with errors of omission such as this is that they mislead the reader into believing that in order to understand Reid's concept of science and method, all one need do is attend to Newton's regulae philosophandi. But this is not the case. The reasons why Bacon's influence has been ignored or underplayed are not difficult to understand. Like Reid, Bacon has been neglected in the twentieth century by philosophical scholarship. Our focus in this century seems to have been on the mighty triumvirate of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. Further, Bacon has never really recovered from Macaulay's critique of him as a naive inductivist who failed to understand the role of mathematics in scientific discovery. One cannot help but think that</page><page sequence="2">REID'S INDEBTEDNESS TO BACON 497 Macauley's character assassination of Bacon has contributed to our ne glect of him as well. Just as the Athenians were wont to level charges of corrupting the youth against their philosophers, it seems the British have in dulged in accusing their philosophers of not being "lovers of truth" and be ing consumed instead with either political ambition, as in the case of Bacon, or consumed with literary ambition, as in the case of Hume. Fortunately, Reid lacked the concern of Macaulay about Bacon's character, nor did he fault Lord Verulam for failing to understand the role of mathematics in natural science. It was in the midst of the scientific revolution of the Renaissance that Francis Bacon developed his views on the nature of scientific inquiry. He did not see himself primarily as a scientist but more as a trumpeter whose role it was to "call the wits together" for the purposes of the Great In stauration. By "Great Instauration" Bacon meant a new founding and great restoration of the sciences. Because of the influence of scholastic Aristotelianism, the sciences were viewed by Bacon as being locked in a hopeless state of stagnation. In order to free science from this state, Bacon articulated a philosophy of science and method which he hoped would allow the sciences to make genuine progress. Born some eighty-four years after Bacon's death, Thomas Reid heard the Baconian trumpet and pursued his investigations accordingly. In Reid's mind, and in the mind of many of his contemporaries, the success which was being achieved in natural philosophy was due to the fact that in vestigators pursued their inquiries according to the Baconian plan. It is ob vious from the quotes below that Reid held Bacon in high esteem. In the Philosophical Orations we are told, Bacon also was the only one to teach how this true interpretation of nature is to be acquired by relying on experiments in operation in nature or art. So much so is the Novum Organum the first and ultimate work of its type that it ought to be called a grammar of nature or rather the mighty author of that grammar.3 In the Inquiry we find similar praise, The rules of inductive reasoning, or of a just interpretation of nature, as well as the fallacies by which we are apt to misinterpret her language, have been, with wonderful sagacity, delineated by the great genius of lord Bacon; so that his Novum Organum may justly be called a grammar of the language of nature.4 The above quote is instructive because it suggests that Reid regarded Bacon's contribution as twofold. First, Bacon provided us with a method of induction. Second, he pointed out the fallacies by which we misinterpret nature. We will return to this point shortly after we have looked at how Reid regarded Newton with respect to Bacon. Reid regarded Newton as a good Baconian, as someone who followed</page><page sequence="3">498 ALAN WADE DAVENPORT Bacon's method in his natural philosophy. In the Philosophical Orations Reid is explicit about Newton's indebtedness to Lord Verulam. Nor is there any doubt that Newton himself, led by the hand of this pre-eminent man [Bacon] and taught by his admonitions brought about in this way suc cessful advances in natural philosophy.5 The same perspective on the two men greets us at the end of the Inquiry. It adds greatly to the merit of this work [Novum Organum] and atones for its defects that at the time it was written the world had not seen any tolerable model of inductive reasoning, from which the rules of it might be copied. The arts of poetry and eloquence were grown up to perfection when Aristotle described them; but the art of interpreting nature was yet in embryo when Bacon delineated its manly features and proportions. Aristotle drew his rules from the best models of those arts which have yet appeared; but the best models of induc tive reasoning that have yet appeared, which I take to be the third book of the Principia and the Optics of Newton were drawn from Bacon's rules. The pur pose of all those rules is to teach us to distinguish seeming or apparent connec tions of things in the course of nature, from those which are real.6 Needless to say, at the beginning of the Inquiry Reid mentions Newton's methodological rules as the primary devices with which we should pursue our inquiries into the human mind, as well as into the phenomenon of natural science. Indeed, Reid even refers to them as maxims of common sense which are "practiced in everyday life" as when the ordinary man learns that "cold freezes water."7 Of course, Reid is not being inconsistent when he praises both Bacon and Newton in the same work. In Reid's mind, Newton and Bacon did not articulate two different and inconsistent sets of methodological rules. Rather, Newton reduced Bacon's methodological views to a set of four rules. In his later work, the Essays On the Intellectual Powers of Man Reid is explicit about this. Lord Bacon first delineated the only solid foundation on which natural philosophy can be built; and Sir Isaac Newton reduced the principles laid down by Bacon into three or four axioms, which he calls regulaephilosophandi. From these, together with the phenomena observed by the senses, which he also lays down as first principles, he deduces by strict reasoning, the propositions con tained in the third book of the Principia and in his Optics. ... 8 Now Reid's view of the Newtonian regulae raises an interesting question. Just how are the Newtonian regulae reductions of the Baconian method? Generally speaking, Reid regarded both Newton and Bacon as the primary enemies of "conjecture and hypothesis" in natural philosophy and Reid saw in Newton's rules a protection against them. However, with respect to the first of the regulae there is a more specific reason for regarding it as a Baconian rule since the rule enjoins us to avoid one of the chief errors of the idola fori, an error which Reid feels rests at the core of the theory of ideas.</page><page sequence="4">REID'S INDEBTEDNESS TO BACON 499 Having noted that Reid credits Bacon with articulating a method of in duction and pointing out the ways in which we fallaciously interpret nature, we will now explore more specifically the influence of Bacon on Reid. Reid* s own expressed indebtedness to Bacon nicely parallels the latter's con trasting discussions of "Anticipations of Nature" and "Interpretation of Nature." Anticipations of Nature are "the conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matters of nature," and the way in which they are or dinarily applied is "as a thing rash and premature."9 We may note here that Bacon's discussion of the idols is intended as an exposition of how we rashly and prematurely interpret nature. In contrast, Interpretation of Nature is "that reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process."10 This is the method of induction and experiment outlined in the later sections of the Novum Organum. One way to look at Bacon's approach to method is that it involves two aspects, a negative and a positive side. On the one hand, Bacon's discus sions of the idols are intended to inform us of what to avoid in the process of investigating nature. On the other hand, the method of induction in forms us how to systematize facts and reach generalizations which capture the nature of the subject under investigation. At the end of the Inquiry Reid similarly informs us that there are two ways of investigating the human mind, the way of reflection and the way of analogy. The way of reflection is essentially an inductive and introspective analysis and dissection of our mental faculties. The way of analogy is based on tenuous similarities be tween mind and body which, Reid believes, have given birth to the theory of ideas. This approach to the human mind is essentially Reid's version of an anticipation of nature, rather than an interpretation of nature, in the science of the human mind. The way of reflection is, of course, the only method which will result in a just interpretation of the mind. In short, just as in Bacon we are enjoined to avoid anticipations of nature so in Reid we are enjoined to avoid the way of analogy. Analogical reasoning is the foun dation of virtually all of our errors with respect to the human mind. Reid locates analogical reasoning as one of the chief errors of the idola tribus in the Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man. In a chapter on the fallacies of judgment, Reid begins by embracing Lord Bacon's division. Many authors have furnished useful materials for that purpose, and some have endeavored to reduce them to a system. I like best the division given of them by Lord Bacon in his fifth book De augmentis scientarium, and more fully treated in his Novum Organum. He divides them into four classes, idola tribus, idola specus, idola fori, and idola theatri. The names are perhaps fanciful; but I think the division judicious; like most of the productions of that wonderful genius.11 Reid goes on to tell us that he intends to give instances of each type of error without restricting himself specifically to those mentioned by Bacon or</page><page sequence="5">500 ALAN WADE DAVENPORT pretending to a complete enumeration. Reid mentions six prejudices or biases of the human mind in the class of idola tribus. Analogical reasoning is one of these and is said to be based on our tendency to understand the less known by the better known. Interestingly enough, even though Reid adds to Bacon's discussion, much of what he has to say is consistent in both spirit and content with what Bacon has to say concerning the reasons for the stagnation of the sciences. For Bacon the idola tribus are errors which have their foundation in human nature itself. The Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men.12 In the De augmentis scientarium Bacon identifies the following error as one of the idols of the tribe. It is incredible what a number of idols have been introduced into philosophy by the reduction of natural operations to a correspondence with human actions, that it, by imagining nature acts as man does, which is not much better than the heresy of the anthropomorphites, that sprung up in the cells and solitude of ig norant monks; or the opinion of Epicurus; who attributed a human figure to the gods.13 In short, the error committed is analogizing the operations of nature with the operations of man. Reid turns Bacon on his head, so to speak, and com plains that the theory of ideas has committed the reverse analogy, of assum ing that the operations of the mind are executed in the same fashion as ac tions in the physical world. Thought is considered as analogous to motion in a body; and as bodies are put in motion by impulses, and by impressions made upon them by contiguous ob jects, we are apt to think that the mind is made to think by impressions made upon it. . . . 14 Reid even mentions Bacon's "fallacy of anthropomorphism" in his discus sion of analogical reasoning. Hence in all ages men have been prone to attribute the human figure and human passions and frailties to superior intelligences; and even to the supreme Being.15 Now the foundation of arguments from analogy is our tendency to understand the less known by the better known. Reid emphasizes in a number of places that we most frequently attend to objects of sense, i.e., physical objects, rather than to our own mental operations. Indeed, this is one of the factors which makes the science of mind so difficult. We have a habit of inattention to our minds and our focus is on the world around us.</page><page sequence="6">REID'S INDEBTEDNESS TO BACON 501 Reid states this rather clearly in the Inquiry when he discusses the way of analogy. For a considerable part of life, we can think of nothing but the objects of sense; and to attend to objects of another nature, so as to form clear and distinct no tions of them, is no easy matter, even after we come to years of reflection. The condition of mankind, therefore, affords good reason to apprehend, that their language, and their common notions, concerning the mind and its operations, will be analogical, and derived from the objects of sense; and that these analogies will be apt to impose upon philosophers, as well as upon the vulgar, and to lead them to materialize the mind and its faculties; and experience abun dantly confirms the truth of this.16 In sum, Reid*s account of the way of analogy and his discussion of analogical reasoning in general have their roots in Bacon's idola tribus. Since a substantial part of Reid's attack on the theory of ideas aims at dis mantling the analogy and since Reid regarded his attack on the theory of ideas as his greatest contribution to philosophy, it is not surprising to find Reid praising Bacon as he so frequently does. The influence, however, is more profound than this. For Bacon, the cure for what Reid terms "analogical reasoning" is for the mind to force itself to attend to "heterogenous instances." In the Novum Organum Bacon makes this point as follows. The human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly, and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow, though it cannot see how, similar to those few things by which it is surrounded. But for that going to and fro to remote and heterogenous instances by which axioms are tried as by fire, the intellect is altogether slow and unfit, unless it be forced there to by severe laws and overruling authority.17 Now a heterogenous instance for Bacon is an instance which forces us to modify or give up an axiom of nature. It is essentially a disconfirming in stance of the axiom. In Reid's attack on the theory of ideas one of the more prominent heterogenous instances is the case of the Blind Mathematician. If the theory of ideas is correct then it should not be possible for a blind man to have concepts of visible appearance of figure, motion, and extension of bodies. Reid very deftly argues that the blind mathematician can have such concepts, thus calling into question the position that all such concepts must be derived ultimately from sensations or sense impressions of which the concepts are merely fainter copies. The point to be made here is that follow ing Bacon's advice, Reid is attempting to test the ideal theory's position on concept formation by forcing us to attend to a heterogenous instance which tests the theory "as by fire." Hence, Reid turns another Baconian</page><page sequence="7">502 ALAN WADE DAVENPORT methodological concept against a theory which in the hands of many of its adherents was presented as an analysis of the mind based on the experimen tal method. It is now time for us to turn to Newton's regulaephilosophandi. Of the Newtonian methodological rules which have received the most attention, it would seem that it is the first that is regarded as prominent in influence on Reid. Since Reid regarded the regulae as concise summaries of Baconian method, we will now look at this rule from a Baconian perspective. Newton's first regulum reads as follows. "We are to admit no more causes of things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their ap pearances."18 Reid is fairly explicit about what he takes the rule to mean. If a philosopher, therefore, pretends to show us the cause of any natural effect, whether relating to matter or to mind; let us first consider whether there be suf ficient evidence that the cause he assigns does really exist. If there be not, reject it with disdain as a fiction which ought to have no place in genuine philosophy. If the cause assigned really exist, consider in the next phase, whether the effect it is brought to explain necessarily follows from it. Unless it have these two condi tions it is good for nothing.19 In short, Newton's rule enjoins us to have sufficient evidence for the ex istence of the cause we postulate and to make sure that the effect must necessarily follow from the cause. A law of nature which does not meet these two conditions is "good for nothing." The key to understanding Reid's interpretation of the first methodological rule of Newton's is Bacon's discussion of the idola fori, the class of fallacies imposed on us by language. Reid's own discussion of the idola fori is rather sketchy. However, Reid holds that There is no greater impediment to the advancement of knowledge than the am biguity of words. To this chiefly it is owing that we find sects and parties in most branches of science; and disputes, which are carried on from age to age without being brought to an issue.20 Bacon would have agreed with Reid. The scholastic Aristotelian sciences were imbued with "confused and ill-defined notions," and the confusion, he held, was of two kinds. The idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds. They are either names of things which do not exist (for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation, so likewise are there names which result from fan tastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds), or they are names of things which exist, but yet confused and ill-defined, and hastily and ir regularly derived from realities. Of the former kind are Fortune, the Prime Mover, Planetary Orbits, Elements of Fire, and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories.21</page><page sequence="8">REID'S INDEBTEDNESS TO BACON 503 In short, one of the chief errors "imposed by words" on the understanding is the use of terms which simply do not refer to really existent phenomena. Ideas, like the Prime Mover and Fortune, are mere fictions for Reid in vented to solve problems of human perception and memory. And the term 'idea', Reid argues over and over again, is a non-referring term. Newton's first rule, insofar as it enjoins us to use terms that refer to ac tually existent causes for whose existence we have evidence thus enjoins us to avoid one of the chief Baconian errors. Seen in this light there is no need for Reid scholars to disjoin Newtonian and Baconian methodology when Reid uses the first rule to either attack the theory of ideas or to develop posi tions in his own philosophy. In his analysis of perception, for instance, Reid is very careful not to add to nature anything of his own invention, i.e., not to impose on nature any fictions of his own creation as Descartes did when he postulated "vortices" to explain the movement of the planets. Reid makes this point in a letter to Lord Kames. A cause that is conjectured ought to be such that, if it does really exist, it will produce the effect. If it have not this quality, it hardly deserves the name of con jecture. Supposing it to have this quality, the question remains?whether it does exist or not? And this, being a question of fact, is to be tried by positive evidence. Thus, Descartes conjectured that the planets are carried 'round the sun in a vortex of subtle matter. The cause here assigned is sufficient to produce the effect. It may therefore, be entitled to the name of conjecture. But where is the evidence of the existence of such a vortex? If there be no evidence for it even though there were none against it, it is a conjecture and ought to have no admit tance into chaste natural philosophy.22 Reid goes on in this letter to tell us how a "Man in his closet" may make a thousand conjectures of the form "If such a cause exists, it will produce such a phenomenon." However, not until he leaves his closet and consults nature directly will he be able to determine whether or not the cause exists. All of the above lead us the following position about the nature of an "hypothesis" for Reid. An hypothesis can be distinguished from a genuine law of nature by its content. A general rule which contains non-referring terms that function in the place of the cause of some effect mentioned in the rule is a mere hypothesis. This is not to say that a general rule might not fail in other ways. The cause mentioned in the rule might really exist but might be inadequate to the task of explaining the effect. This is the other side of Reid's attack on the theory of ideas. Even if we grant that ideas exist, they do not explain the problems of perception and memory. However, by "hypothesis" both Reid and Bacon intended methodological considerations as well as what we might call "content considerations." In short, what makes an hypothesis an hypothesis is not simply properties of the rule itself, but also how we arrived at the rule. Both Reid and Bacon felt that the only</page><page sequence="9">504 ALAN WADE DAVENPORT way to arrive at genuine laws of nature was to follow the method of induc tion and experiment. Both philosophers also thought that this method in volved asending from lower axioms of nature up to the most general. Scholastic science had failed in a number of ways for Bacon, and the failure was due primarily to serious methodological weaknesses. This kind of science determined its axioms rashly and prematurely. One of these weaknesses was a tendency to leap to the highest generalities first without the necessity of establishing rules of lower generality. Since these abstrac tions were ill-grounded, attempts to deduce genuine axioms of lower generality from them were doomed to failure. Bacon tells us, There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms; from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immoveable, proceeds to judgement and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this is the way now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried.23 Reid accepted this view of Bacon's concerning the necessity of proceeding to principles of lower generality prior to determining principles of greater generality. Writing to Lord Kames in 1775 Reid says, Human knowledge is like the steps of a ladder. The first step consists of par ticular truths, discovered by observation and experiment: the second collects these into more general truths: the third into still more general. But there are many such steps before we come to the top; that is, to the most general truth. Ambitious of knowledge, and unconscious of our own weakness, we would fain jump at once from the lowest to the highest; but the consequence of this is, that we tumble down, and find that our labor must be begun anew. Is not this a good picture of a philosopher, my Lord? I think so truly; and I should be vain of it, if I were not afraid that I have stolen it from Lord Bacon.24 According to Reid the adherents of the ideal theory had embraced a princi ple of the highest generality prior to proceeding through the necessary stage of determining principles of lower generality. The principle which they em braced in one form or other was the principle that "All objects of human thought are only ideas in our minds." Let us call this principle "I." Prin ciples of lower generality would be principles such as "All objects of human memory are only ideas in our own minds," or "All objects of human perceiving are only ideas in our own minds." Let us call these principles "II" and "12" respectively. We could also have principles of lower generality than 12 such as "All objects of sight are only ideas in our minds," "All objects of touch are merely ideas in our minds," "All objects of taste are only ideas in our own mind," "All objects of hearing are merely ideas in our own minds," and "All objects of smell are merely ideas in our own</page><page sequence="10">REID'S INDEBTEDNESS TO BACON 505 minds." Let us call these principles "12a," "I2b," "I2c," "I2d," and "I2e" respectively. Given Reid's acceptance of the Baconian doctrine of higher and lower axioms he must have thought the "proof" of I involved first the establishment of II and 12, and that the "proof of 12 involved the establishment of I2a through I2e. In other words, the evidence for the truth of I is the truth of II and 12, and the evidence for the truth of 12 would be the truth of I2a through I2e. Ultimately, the truth of I depends on the facts of observation and experiment. While Reid is not explicit about his following the above procedure, I believe that this is what he is doing in the Inquiry. Reid devotes a chapter to each sense in that work in order to determine the principles of operation for each sense as if he were looking for principles of comparable generality to I2a through I2e. But not only this, in the process of his analysis of each sense he is showing that there is no evidence for each of the lower axioms of the ideal theory. By showing that there is no reason to suppose there are ideas present for each sense, he is showing there is no evidential foundation for I. Looked at in this sense, the entire Inquiry is a single sustained attack on the theory of ideas, based on the methodological principle of the necessi ty of ascending gradually from lower to higher axioms. There are other aspects of Reid*s philosophy which show a Baconian stamp, and which, for want of space, we have been unable to explore in this paper. Reid's use of legal metaphors and his theory of signs, as well as the nature of scientific laws appear to have their foundation in much of what Bacon has to say on these topics. Nonetheless, if this paper has succeeded in convincing the reader that Bacon's influence on Reid is more profound than has yet been supposed, it will have accomplished its primary task. Reid's in terpretation of Bacon's idols lays the foundation for his attack on the theory of ideas, especially his interpretation of the idola tribus and the idola fori. It is the latter category of idols which also appears to have influenced Reid's view and use of Newton's first rule. Moreover, it seems that the structure of the Inquiry itself is influenced by the Baconian distinction be tween middle and higher axioms. It is no surprise then that Dugald Stewart would comment in his biography of Reid that, The influence and general views opened in the "Novum Organum' ' may be traced in almost every page of his writings: and, indeed, the circumstance by which these are so strongly and characteristically distinguished, is, that they ex hibit the first systematical attempt to exemplify, in the study of human nature, the same plan of investigation which conducted Newton to the properties of light, and to the law of gravitation.25 Nor should it surprise us that Reid's contemporaries paid tribute to him as the penultimate Baconian of his time in the science of the human mind. Above his ashes one may read the following inscription:</page><page sequence="11">506 ALAN WADE DAVENPORT Memoriae sacrum Thomas Reid, S.T.D., quondam in Schola Regia Aberdonen si Philosophiae Professons; nuper vero Universitate Glasguensi, ab anno 1764 usque ad annum 1796.

Louise Marcil-Lacoste, Claude Buffier and Thomas Reid: Two Philosophers of Common-Sense, (McGill-Queens University Press, 1982). Professor Marcil Lacoste recognizes the influence of Bacon on Reid in the development of his concept of common sense. She mentions not only Reid's use of the experimenta lucifera and Bacon's general method of induction, but also the analogy of the tribunal and its role in Reid's theory of evidence. However, she does not mention the influence of Bacon's idols on Reid nor does she see that Reid regarded Newton as a Baconian. Further, she does not appear to see the significance of Bacon's distinction between middle and high axioms for the interpretation of Reid's Inquiry. See page 132 where she claims that "Reid did not think that we need what Bacon called a just scale of as cent" from the lowest through the middles to the highest axioms." This claim con flicts with Reid's letter to Lord Kames where he appears to embrace this distinction. See note 24 in this paper. 2. Norman Daniels, Thomas Reid's Inquiry: The Geometry of Visibles and the Case for Realism, (New York: Burt Franklin &amp; Co., 1974). Daniels comments rather extensively on the "science of mind" and the influence of Newton's methodology on Reid. He does not mention Bacon at all. The methodological orthodoxy of the day, however, was not simply based on Newton's "disavowal of hypothesis" as Daniel's suggests (see page 29). It should be obvious from Reid's praise of Bacon that Bacon shared at least an equal place of prominence?in Reid's mind at least. In this vein, we ought not to forget that The Royal Society, of which Newton was a member, was founded essentially as a tribute to Lord Verulam.
