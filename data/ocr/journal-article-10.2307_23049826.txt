To help understand why this shark tar geted Pamperin and the more general question of why these animals sometimes attack humans, scientists created the Shark Attack File (SAF) to document as many historical and contemporary shark attacks as possible into legible data sets. To protect people from sharks, the SAF functioned as a model to help translate and predict sharks' behaviors but ultimately privileged environmental conditions and human vulnerability over the possibility of animal agency. Since 1959, many scholars in animal studies have tried to complicate earlier declensionist narratives that portrayed wild animals as passive entities into agents-in-the-world. On June 14, 1959, Robert L. Pamperin entered the Pacific Ocean at Alligator Head, a rocky headland off La Jolla, California, with a friend, Gerald Lehrer, to dive for abalone. Wearing only pink swim trunks, blue fins, and a black face mask, Pamperin had been working the waters 150 feet from shore when he screamed for help. Lehrer, 50 feet away, raced to the spot where his diving Â© 2011 The Author.

When Lehrer submerged to look for Pamperin, he saw the final moments of a horrific shark attack. Nearly 25 feet below the surface, only the head and torso of his friend's body jutted out of the animal's jaws as the shark thrashed its head back and forth against the ocean floor. After Lehrer retreated to the headland to warn others of the danger, he could provide only a sketchy description of the marine predator: nearly 20 feet in length, white ventral coloring, even gray on the dorsal side, a larger upper lobe on the caudal (tail) fin, teeth just over an inch high. He could recall neither the shape nor color of the head. In spite of the best efforts of the local authorities and volunteers from the nearby Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Pamperin's body was never recovered. Like an ephemeral monster, this individual shark left little trace of its role in this human-centered narrative: the fish slipped back into an anonymous (animal-centered) existence in the surrounding waters.1 The fatal encounter serves as a dramatic counterpoint to Peter Matthiessen's 1959 Wildlife in America, a work published the same year that tracked the decline and extermination of many North American wild animals, creatures that fell victim to human fear, avarice, and neglect as well as evolu tionary pressures. By describing various animals as dumb (Gila monster) or silent (California condor), Matthiessen crafted a rhetoric that underscored the finality of animal death and extinction relative to human power. Sharks and other large predators, in contrast, invert those traditional human-animal hierarchies when they convert human bodies into energy. The history of being prey underscores the similarities between humans and other animals of embodied nature and mortality.2 Compared to the endangered animals in Wildlife in America, the La Jolla shark proved that a creature's silence did not always mean vulnerability or passivity within human histories. How then should scholars describe that shark's role in a longer history of human-animal relationships? And how did observers in the late 1950s understand such a power ful and ephemeral creature? Was the animal really an agent in the La Jolla attack or simply part of a dynamic structure of nature? Since 1959 many scholars have wrestled with these kinds of questions and sought to complicate earlier declensionist narratives that portrayed wild animals as passive entities. Few approaches were more important to this trend than animal studies, an interdisciplinary field that examines animals as sub jects and not simply objects of human influence. Defined broadly by Erica Fudge, animal agency means the ability to cause change and does not necessarily imply concurrent self-consciousness, subjectivity, language, morality, or culture on the part of the agent that we (usually) designate as the distinguishing hall marks of humanity.3 In this view, wild animals are not one-dimensional partic ipants in historical narratives onto which humans simply impose meanings or actions. Rather, both kinds of agents-humans and other animals-are simultane ously entangled together materially and discursively as they move through both space and time.4 Many sharks, like the one that attacked Pamperin, are</page><page sequence="3">WHEN SHARKS (DON'T) ATTACK | 453 agents-in-the-world even if humans cannot identify with absolute certainty why these animals behave as they do. Sharks and fishes generally may be more diffi cult for human observers to anthropomorphize than social mammals like wolves or whales, but nonetheless they influence how many Americans have thought about nature and human-animal relationships over time.5 Not surprisingly, other scholars have objected vociferously to this approach as both intellectually and morally suspect. These critics caution against attrib uting agency to nonhuman animals as historical participants or conflating the ability to cause change (or a "role" in change) with agency because scholars can never know what animals might believe about any human-centered historical subject such as industrial capitalism or imperialism. These scholars claim that not only is there insufficient primary source evidence to make empirical claims about animal agency or perspectives, but even worse, scholars risk com mitting "a category mistake," in which the application of human-centered per ceptions and worldview stands for the totality of individual and group animal experiences. Animal agency, they argue, is nothing more than an analytical dis tinction without much difference-"to imagine that animals think like humans or to cast animals in human roles is a form of self-centered narcissism"-or so this critique contends.6 Although the treatment just described can only gesture at the debate over animal agency, the history of the Pamperin fatality and other shark attacks also challenges the "vast amount of power in a supposedly rational center" of human narratives.7 Scientific observers in 1959 wrestled with this tension when they worried that they, too, were making a category mistake by universal izing shark behavior to address what many public officials at the time called the "shark-hazard problem." A year earlier in April 1958, the Office of Naval Research had organized a conference in New Orleans to review the latest shark science. Among the conference participants' recommendations was the establishment of the worldwide Shark Attack File (SAF). Located at the Smithsonian Institution, the SAF documented as many legitimate historical and contemporary shark attacks as possible into legible data sets "to learn more about the environmental conditions and the behavior patterns and activ ities which provoke a shark to attack."8 In the immediate hours after the La Jolla attack, scientists and other observers began another investigation to under stand why this shark targeted Pamperin and whether this encounter helped answer the more general question of why sharks sometimes attack humans. By gathering newspaper accounts, interviews with victims and witnesses, photographs, and hospital reports, these scientists created a case file for each attack that privileged environmental conditions and human vulnerability over the possibility of animal agency. For example, Pamperin was case number 376, one of thirty-nine attacks in 1959, in which the young man and his environ ment were described in detail but the shark remained elusively abstract. To protect people from sharks, the SAF functioned as a model to help translate and predict sharks' behaviors based on what one researcher admitted was</page><page sequence="4">454 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 16 (JULY 2011) "scattered observations . . . and our own feelings as to what we would do if we were a shark."9 These scientists hoped that the SAF might reconcile two oppos ing viewpoints about sharks: a diverse group of unpredictable individuals, in control of their bodies as they navigated through different environmental con ditions and life histories, versus a behaviorist interpretation that assumed sharks were responding automatically to external stimuli, like the pink color of a swimmer's bathing suit or a water temperature of 68 degrees. Through observation, data collection, and analysis, participants in the SAF hoped to avoid essentializing sharks into a single ahistorical category in order to protect the animals that mattered most to them: other humans. The scientists' confidence in the SAF model did not last. By the late 1960s, some members wanted to subject the data previously segregated in separate case files to statistical analysis using computers programmed by experts from the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Through this process, they dis covered that the SAF suffered from a significant flaw: there were no control data, no examples of sharks ignoring humans or specific environmental condi tions, and no evidence showing that sharks often do not attack. Therefore, the researchers could not correlate environmental conditions or external stimuli to attacks. By avoiding people in the water, sharks also may show agency-in-the-world as these animals navigate their own life histories beyond human detection or expectations. By the early 1970s, scientists inside and outside the project admitted that the SAF was essentially data noise.10 In effect, the SAF failed to capture more than traces of the La Jolla shark and other predators, much less the animal histories of other sharks swimming the world's oceans. Nearly ten years after the publication of Wildlife in America, Matthiessen found himself floating underwater in a cage off southern Australia as white sharks glided into view. Unlike Robert Pamperin, however, the author sought out the chance to watch these animals approach and retreat back into their own worlds. When Matthiessen tried to describe this experience of looking across the species divide at these otherworldly animals, at these agents-in-the-world, in his 1971 book Blue Meridian, he again conjured an encounter in which silence conveyed animal passivity along with the impossi bility of mutual comprehension. He sketched their forms and movements as ineffable, impenetrable, implacable: "The shadow of sharks is the shadow of death, and they call forth dim ultimate fears. Yet there is something holy in their silence."11 The problem with Matthiessen's ethereal interpretation of sharks, and that of the SAF too, is that they deny the historicity, diversity, and agency of wild animals. The silence was imposed on the fishes by human interlocutors, like Matthiessen and some of the scientists from the SAF. The animals were hardly individuals at all: they were projections of categories without any control data, without their own animal-centered life histories. Nearly fifty years later, we ought not to take these animal silences for granted. With the insights of animal studies scholars, environmental historians</page><page sequence="5">WHEN SHARKS (DON'T) ATTACK | 455 can begin to track these wild animals as historical subjects with their own agency-in-the-world.
