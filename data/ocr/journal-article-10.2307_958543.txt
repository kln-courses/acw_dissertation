<plain_text><page sequence="1">taken up by the soloist. Of the two contrasting types of material, it is the allegro deciso element which is favoured in the development, particularly in a shattering climax just before a largamente restatement of the 12-note theme. The calmo material is also recalled, after a thoughtful cadenza, and the movement ends on a chromatic run upwards in a written-out acceleration for the whole orchestra. The second of the two movements is basically a presto scherzo with two trios and an epilogue. The soloist takes no part in the first section of the scherzo and is induced to make an entry, in an apparently protesting recitative, only after a loud allusion to the chattering woodwind music from the first movement. Since the recitative also echoes first-movement material, there need be no surprise at the anthropomorphic gestures at this point. But when, in this atonal and still not clearly metrical context, the strings offer a simple rhythmic accom- paniment figure in plain A minor and the soloist obliges with a cabaletta, the listener is bound to wonder why. Similarly, the second trio (again introduced by a solo recitative) is an andante aria in Db major. Such tonal features may be related to the fact that the Violin Concerto was written shortly after the composer's first visit to Italy. As a pupil of Eisler, Blake was firmly brought up in the post- Schoenberg Teutonic tradition. So the Italian experience-particularly the sculpture of Michel- angelo, but also the atmosphere of the campagna and the melos of bel canto-affected him all the more deeply. This explains the presence of the A minor and Db major trios. It was a night-time scene at Barga which inspired the opening nocturne, the Michelangelo David in the Florence Academy which inspired the powerful orchestral writing in the allegro deciso, and the Madonna in St Peter's which inspired the ethereal calmo second subject. It is the Italian experience, too, which explains the unexpected acceleration in the softening of the intellectual rigour associated with Blake's earlier music. This is not intended to suggest, however, that Blake has lost his structural virtue. Although he is certainly taking more risks, on behalf of the senses, the Violin Concerto is no less well integrated for that. By the time the second trio of the second move- ment appears, there have already been several allusions back to the first movement, not to mention all the more or less distant serial relationships be- tween the various themes. Now the andante is merged with the presto material, as the soloist continues his Db aria and the orchestra simul- taneously resumes the scherzo. A massive orchestral climax brings the proportions of the presto into symmetrical balance with those of the allegro deciso, and a chromatic run downwards in a written-out deceleration neatly reflects the end of the first movement. Not surprisingly, the slow epilogue (my termin- ology) is a lingering recall of the opening nocturne, mingled with memories of the Madonna. Over these lyrical echoes the solo violin sings a melody shaped by the words of a Michelangelo sonnet, lines from which stand on the title page of the score. The witty last few bars allude discreetly to the rhythm of the cabaletta and end quietly on a chord not unrelated to D[. Bernard Benoliel Calum MacDonald Benoliel's 'With St Paul in Albion' will be performed in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, by Alasdair Mitchell and Michael Lester-Cribb, on August 29. Bernard Benoliel is a 32-year-old American com- poser who has been living in this country for the past five years. Not a note of his music is yet published, and until recently he experienced great difficulty in obtaining performances of his works, even though the scores tended to arouse strong reactions for or against. It is as hard as ever to break the vicious circle whereby unwillingness to take pains over music that requires much time and effort, if its composer has no established reputation, ensures that the composer remains without repu- tation through lack of performances. Happily, after four performanceless years Benoliel's situation began to change. It is to be hoped that the coming performance during the Edinburgh Festival of his With St Paul in Albion, for amplified cello and organ, will focus some belated attention on a composer whom I believe to be one of the most significant of his generation. 650 Benoliel was born in Detroit, where he played piano and trumpet and studied composition with Ross Lee Finney at the University of Michigan. The first works he now acknowledges date from 1968; and in that year he became a private pupil of the late Stefan Wolpe, with whom he studied in New York until 1970. Wolpe (who regarded Benoliel as one of the most gifted pupils of his last years) gave him his most valuable insights into the re- sources of pitch serialism. But Wolpe had also been a proteg6 of Busoni: David Drew once wrote that Wolpe was the chief heir to 'the tradition of Busoni's radicalism, rather than of his classicism'. It may be that this part of Busoni's divided mantle now rests on Benoliel's shoulders. Certainly his music, like Busoni's, stubbornly resists easy classification. His works are few, but painstakingly and meticulously crafted. Their outlook is intensely traditional, but that should give no comfort to mere conservatives, for they celebrate a still-advancing tradition in the pride of its full complexity. By the same token, the music</page><page sequence="2">pays no attention to fashionable trends-there are no aleatory free-for-alls, no collages of quotations, no gimmicks of any kind: no effects, in fact; only substance. There is a resourceful serial technique; dense, rhythmically complex, precisely notated contrapuntal textures; and dissonant, granitic, but masterfully directed harmony that gives the music an enormous sense of breadth and through which one senses Benoliel's deep spiritual affinity with the music he admires most, Beethoven, the Wagner of Parsifal, and above all Bruckner. We should also think of him in relation to a specifically American 'transcendentalist' tradition, to such composers as Ives and Ruggles. In short, Benoliel's music concerns itself with a strong sense of the metaphysical, but does so with intense intellectual rigour. In this, if in nothing else, it emulates Schoenberg. And on the technical level Benoliel has tackled what is perhaps the central problem for any post-Schoenbergian composer, that of vertical harmony. The massive chordal sonorities of his most recent music, used as foils to the characteristically knotty serial polyphony, broaden and deepen the expressive range in a way that leads naturally to a 'symphonic' conception of musical structure; and Benoliel, though he has written only one symphony as such so far, regards himself as primarily a symphonist. A 'symphonic' sense of scale and timing is already apparent in his earliest serial work The Black Tower (1968-9) for large chamber ensemble and soprano, which was featured in a recent SPNM Forum/ Recording at the GSM. This is a set of variations, culminating in a passionate and memorable setting of the last poem of Yeats which, for all its difficulty, is a feat of sustained melodic invention rare indeed in contemporary music. The unbroken 25-minute span of the craggy String Quartet (1969) translates this sustained thinking into purely instrumental terms with uncompromising force-too uncom- promising for some, to judge by the disturbances that greeted its first performance in the 1970 Tangle- wood Season. The culmination of his efforts so far, however, is unquestionably the monumental and visionary First Symphony (1972-3), as yet unper- formed. Not only the instrumentation (which requires, inter alia, 3 english horns, 4 Wagner tubas, bass trumpet and, ideally, 76 strings; but no 'exotic' percussion at all) proclaims the work's descent from the German Romantics. The form owes much to the first movement of Mahler's Ninth, while the general style can only dimly be indicated by the necessarily rough description 'serial Bruckner'. What may seem austere on paper will surely be transfigured in performance by the radiance of the harmony and the blazing originality of the orchestral imagination: the work richly deserves a public airing, as soon as possible. With St Paul in Albion is both earlier and later than the Symphony. It was originally composed in 1971, before Benoliel had moved to Britain, but at a time when he had already decided to make the journey. However, it has been much revised since then, and was only recomposed in its present form in 1974, with a dedication to the composer's friend, the novelist Bruce Roberts. It is a meditation, again symphonic in scope, exploring a constellation of personal associations at which the title hints. Benoliel has an immense admiration for the letters of St Paul, whom he views as one of the major visionary and creative personalities in history. St Paul's confrontation with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, which redirected his whole personality, makes him in the widest sense symbolic of the artist in the grip of creative forces. One medieval legend has it that St Paul once visited Britain; but the 'Albion' of Benoliel's title is William Blake's Albion, the metaphysical England, the longed-for land of spiritual renewal. The work has a single movement; a brief adagio introduction prefaces two furiously questing allegros which themselves enclose a profound, quietistic adagio (the scheme bears some resem- blance to Ives's Robert Browning Overture, which Benoliel much admires). The cello is amplified not to distort its tone but to lend it the strength to stand up to, and even overwhelm, the organ at full power. With its ferociously difficult, wide-leaping line it is like a lone yet mighty voice, singing, ex- horting, suffering, reacting to, fighting against and working with the organ. The music's texture is as intractable as life itself; but it gropes towards the light, whatever that may be, and its spirit is any- thing but frenzied: rather it discloses at last a my- sterious but inspiring calm. Two characteristic features of Benoliel's style are powerfully apparent in With St Paul. One is the way in which the music moves. By an ever-changing subdivision of beats, in 3, 5, 6 or 7, plus continual syncopation and cross-rhythm, the pulse of the individual lines becomes fluid and unstable to a degree beyond that of possibly any other contem- porary music. It achieves thereby, maybe, the 'release into timelessness' so many modern composers seek; but only through an extreme precision of rhythmic and motivic control. The other is the remorseless consistency of the harmony, which attains at times an almost incandescent quality. The sense of tonal direction (in the widest sense of the word 'tonal') thus induced is remarkable. To take only one tra- dition-renewing instance: the recapitulation of the main allegro is precipitated by an extraordinary, but carefully prepared, 'dominant preparation' in the shape of a gigantic stacking-up of superimposed Sths, touched off from the cello's lowest C. The sheer physical excitement of such moments must be experienced in performance to be appreciated; and a work such as this needs, and deserves, to be heard many times.
