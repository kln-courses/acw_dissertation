THE AIGINETAN GENESIS OF THE MYRMIDONS: A NOTE ON NEMEAN 3.13-16 The Myrmidons, best known as the Thessalian followers of Achilles, were also said to be the original, autochtonous inhabitants of Aigina. Pindar makes use of this local tradition in Nemean 3, written for the Aiginetan pancratiast Aristokleides, referring to Aigina as Myrmidones hina proteroi oikesan (13ff.). Hesiod (fr. 205 M-W) and Theogenes (FGrHist 300 Fl), quoted by the scholia ad loc., explain the allusion. According to Hesiod the nymph Aigina, impreg- nated by Zeus, gave birth to Aiakos; so that Aiakos would not be alone Zeus hossoi esan myrmekes eperatou endothi nesou / tous andras poiese bathyzo- nous te gynaikas. Theogenes' is a euhemerized account in which an indigenous race of humans, called the Myrmidons because of their ant-like habits (they live in underground caves, from which they dig up soil and throw it out onto the surface), is civilized by Aiakos. Both versions of the tale are widespread.' Pindar asserts the Myrmidons' former presence on Aigina, and it is virtually certain that he accepted their origin as ants.2 Moreover, it is likely that his reference to the Myrmidons, although brief, alludes to their genesis from ants and was highly resonant for his Aiginetan audience. After saying that Aigina was the home of the Myrmidones. . .proteroi he continues h6n palaiphaton agoran 3 ouk elegchessin Aristokleidas... emiane. The Myrmidons here stand for Aigina's heroic past (Aristokleides has not been unworthy of his ancestors, whose individual accomplishments at vv.28-66 form the ode's central mythos) and the reference to their agora emphasizes the island's civic and political traditions.4 Yet it is somewhat surprising that Pindar refers to the assembly of ' The fullest acounts are found in Tz. ad Lyc. 176; Str. (8.375), Nonn. (13.201ff.) and Ovid (Met. 7.517ff.). 2 Pindar elsewhere shows an intimate knowledge of Aiginetan myth and tradition and a willingness to tell local versions of a myth to please his patrons; see my Pindar's Use of Aiginetan Autochthony Myths (unpublished dissertation [UNC-Chapel Hill 1986]). Given the presence of the story in Hesiod, it is inconceivable that Pindar would not have known of it, and unlikely that he would reject a version which so redounds to the credit of his patrons. Moreover, the identification of Myrmidons with myrmekes is usual even in the non-Aiginetan versions of the myth. 3 Mair's conjecture of eiran for the metrically difficult agoran is tempting. Eira is a rare enough word (occurring in this sense only in ll. 18.531 and Hes. Theog. 804, along with glosses in the EM and Hsch.) to account for agoran being a gloss which later crept into the text. Other conjectures (Rauchenstein's alkan and Kayser's hedran) are not particularly close from a paleographic standpoint and assume a more complex process of corruption than does eiran. Since agoran and eiran are essentially synonymous, the choice of reading makes little difference for my argument. 4 Although Wilamowitz (Pindaros [Berlin 1966 [19221 277, n. 21) claims that the phrase Myrmekon agoran "muss einen Ort bezeichnen," comparing it to such Athenian place names as the the6n agora and the Kekropon agora, the sources for the topography of Aigina make no mention of such a place. Compare 0 Syrakousai, bathyptolemou temenos Areos at Pyth. 2.1-2, where Pindar alludes to the martial prowess of the Syracusans with a similarly metonymic phrase. 41</page><page sequence="2">42 CLASSICAL WORLD the Myrmidons, who were primarily known for their fighting ability.5 I argue that Pindar chose the words palaiphaton agoran to emphasize their origin and their retention of ant-like qualities. It is customary in myths of metamorphosis for transformed creatures to retain characteristics of their former state; this sort of retention is in fact explicitly attested for the Myrmidons. Theogenes (loc. cit.) says that Aiakos gave them a syntaxin politiken, hei chresamenous (sc. phasin) autous pantelos dokein ek myrmek6n genesthai, while Ovid (Met. 7.655-7) claims that the mores quos ante gerebant, / nunc quoque habent; parcum genus est patiensque laborum / quaesitique tenax, et qui quaesita reservent. 6 The qualities attributed by Ovid and Theogenes to the Myrmidons-frugality, diligence, and organization-were commonly associated with ants throughout antiquity.7 The anthropomorphism of ants reaches its apogee in three sources which credit them with governmental institutions. As we have seen, Theogenes notes that the transformed Myrmidons still resemble ants in the use of their syntaxis politike, implying that normal ant behavior resembles a human government. Pliny (NH 11.108) is more explicit: he says of ants that et his reipublicae ratio, memoria, cura. Note that Pliny makes this statement without any qualification or apology: he tells his readers that ants have a system of government, not "a system of government, as it were"; presumably his audience would not find the metaphor overly bold. Most significant is the passage in Lucian's Icaromenippus (19) which strongly implies that this particular anthropomorphism was common. Menippus, asked by his compan- ion about the appearance of humans seen from the air, likens them to ants, beginning his response with the words Oimai se pollakis ed myrmeko6n agoran he6rakenai. Menippus, like Pliny, refers to the agora of ants without qualification. Moreover, he expects his companion (and Lucian expects his audience) to have seen this phenomenon on numerous occasions and to be familiar enough with it to allow it to serve as a point of comparison for the less familiar phenomenon of the appearance of a human settlement from the air.8 An agora of ants may even have been a commonplace or proverbial s While epic heroes were renowned for both strength and wisdom (cf. Nem. 8.7-8 cheiri kai boulais aristos), the Myrmidons generally function as an undifferentiated and wholly warlike horde: they are called philoptolemoi at Hom. Il. 16.65; 23.5; 23.129; megaeleores at 19.278; and egchesim6roi at Od. 3.188. Pindar himself, in his only other reference to the Myrmidons (Pai. 6.108), calls them a chalkokorustan homilon. Rauchenstein's suggestion of alkan recognizes this problem and tries to bring the passage more in line with the usual portrayal of the Myrmidons. The reading of the manuscripts (or Mair's emendation) should be retained as a conceptual lectio difficilior, in which the common portrayal of the Myrmidons is rejected for an unusual one. 6 The same tendency appears in the variants of the myth in which the transformation is reversed, with humans becoming ants (Aesop F.240; Servius ad Aen. 4.202): the people had before their transformation the qualities we now associate with ants. ' See for their frugality: Ael. (NA 2.25; 6.43); Verg. (Georg. 1.186); and Aesop F. 241 (the still-famous parable of the grasshopper and the ant). Diligence: Plu. (Soll. Anim. 967D); Arist. (HA 9.38, 622b20ff.); Theoc. (17.107); Phaedrus (4.25). Military organization: Ael. (locc. citt.); Verg. (Aen. 4.402-3). General organization: Plu. (Soil. Anim. 967D); Hsch. (s.v. myrmekia); Ael.

(40.32; 40.40; 48.16). 8 Menippus continues by describing the social institutions of ants, extending the metaphor to explain the appearance of the human community from the air. Ants are credited with division of labor (there are among them builders, politicians, and</page><page sequence="3">SCHOLIA 43 phrase: 9 not only was it familiar to the readers of Lucian, but it is entirely consistent with the qualities assigned to ants throughout antiquity. The image of ants is apparently invariant over time (Aristotle's view of them is consistent with those of Pliny and Lucian), and although Pindar antedates most of our sources by several centuries, there is no reason to think that he and his contemporaries viewed ants in a significantly different way.'0 Reading palaiphaton agoran as an allusion to the ant origin of the Myrmidons explains Pindar's unexpected emphasis on their non-military side: as former ants their agora is as important as their fighting ability. Yet there are other meanings present here. Since the Myrmidons, along with Aiakos, were the original and autochtonous inhabitants of the island, it is natural for them to be connected with the founding of its institutions." Referring to their "long-renowned assembly" allows Pindar to trace the civic institutions of Aigina back to the island's earliest inhabitants, providing a counterbalance to the Aiakid military prowess described in vv. 28-66. The scholiasts, perhaps picking up on the allusion, quote Hesiod and Theogenes, two authors who explicitly associate the Myrmidons with the development of Aiginetan institutions, Theogenes in his reference to their syntaxis politike, Hesiod in his claim that they pr6ton zeuxan neas amphielissas / pr6toi d' histi' neos ptera pontoporoio. 12 It is also possible that Pindar's emphasis on the civic aspects of the Aiginetan Myrmidons is in deliberate contrast to the more martial Thessalian Myrmidons. The phrase Myrmidones proteroi can mean either "the Myrmi- dons of old" '3 or "the earlier Myrmidons".'4 The second reading is quite attractive within the context of Aiginetan myth: the reference to the "earlier Myrmidons" reminds and reassures the audience that the Thessalian Myrmi- dons (and thus Peleus, Achilles and Neoptolemus) are in fact Aiginetan in origin."' The problem of the Aiginetans' dual heritage may also come into play here. Although the Aiginetans considered themselves to be at least the spiritual descendants of the Aiakidai, they admitted the exile of Peleus and Telamon (cf., inter alia, Nem. 5. lOff.) and with it the apparent removal of the philosophers), and Menippus describes their community as a politeia. He concludes with a reference to the transformation of the Myrmidons by way of apology for the possible slight implied in the comparison of humans to ants. 9 If this is the case it may help account for the corruption of eiran to agoran. 10 This way of perceiving and anthropomorphizing ants crosses cultural barriers (cf. Proverbs 6.6, "Go to the ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise") and may be a near-universal human reaction to their behavior. " For Aiakos' founding of the temple of Zeus Hellenios, see Schol. ad Pi. Nem. 5.17; Paus. 2.29.6-8; Apollod. 3.12.6; Isoc. 9.14-15; and Di. Sic. 4.60-61; for Pindar's allusion to the story, see Nem. 8.7-12. For the tendency to credit autochthons with being protoi heuretai, see the Athenians' claim that they invented agriculture (Demosth. 60.5). 12 Pindar was well aware of the importance of Aigina of the development of a commercial fleet; cf. Nem. 5.1ff. and J. Peron, Les Images maritimes de Pindare, Paris, 1974. 13 Cf. Il. 4.308; 5.637; 21.405; 23.332; Pi. O. 7.72; 10.78. 14 Cf. 1. 2.707; 15.182; Od. 15.22; Pi. Pyth. 8.48. 15 It is possible that Pindar's assertion of the Aiginetan origin of the Myrmidons was meant to deny the claims, actual or potential, of other cities on the Myrmidons and the Peleid branch of the Aiakidai. For the importance such mythic assertions could have, see the famous question of the Athenians' reading and alleged revision of Hom. Il. 2.557-8 to bolster their claim on Salamis.</page><page sequence="4">44 CLASSICAL WORLD Aiakid line from Aigina. They also considered themselves Dorians, believing that Aigina had undergone a Dorian invasion (Pindar fr. 1 Bowra [=Isth. 91 Iff.), and the problem of the genealogical link between Aiakos and fifth- century Aigina is a difficult one. Pindar twice juxtaposes the Aiakid and Dorian traditions (fr. I and 01. 8.30), in the latter referring to Aigina with the striking and tantalizingly obscure phrase Doriei laoi tamieuomenan ex Aiakou. In Nem. 3 as well he alludes to Aigina's Dorian heritage, calling it in v. 3 a Dorida nason. The proximity of this phrase to the mention of the Myrmidons (Pindar's only reference to them in an Aiginetan ode) is noteworthy: but we do not yet know enough about the relation of Dorian and Aiakid elements in the Aiginetan tradition to do more than speculate on its significance.
