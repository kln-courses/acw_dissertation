<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON CONTRIBUTORS Dr. Alan Cohen is a retired medical practitioner in England, who has had an interest in archaeology for many years. A recent research project for the British Museum led him to discover a small group of dedicated amateur scientists living during the nineteenth century in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Closely connected, either by friendship or family, their work contributed greatly to the establishment of the study of natural history and the earth sciences in South Africa. He is presently engaged in a biography of Mary Elizabeth Barber, who was the linchpin of the group. Gerald M. Friedman, founding editor of Earth Sciences History and Distin guished Professor of Geology at Brooklyn College and Graduate School of the City University of New York, received the Sidney Powers Memorial Award, the highest honor of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. He also was elected an Honorary Lifetime Member of History of the Earth Sciences Society in 2001, along with Ellis L. Yochelson. These are the first two individuals chosen for this distinction, based on their significant contributions to the history of the earth sciences and to the society. Robert M. Hazen, research scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory and Clarence Robinson Professor of Earth Science at George Mason University, received the B.S. and S.M. in geology at the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology in 1971 and the Ph.D. at Harvard University in earth science in 1975. He is author of 230 articles and sixteen books on science, history, and music. Linda VanAller Hernick is the collections manager of the New York State mu seum paleontology collections. Her area of interest is the history of New York geology. She has published The Gilboa Fossils (Rensselaervielle, NY: Givetian Press, 1996) and "Silas Watson Ford: A Major but Little-Known Contributor to the Cambrian Paleontology of North America," Earth Sciences History, 1999, 18:246-263. Marianne Sommer was recently National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fel low in the Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture program, headed by Londa Schiebinger and Robert Proctor at Pennsylvania State University. After graduating in English Linguistics and Literature and Biology from the University of Zurich, she did part of her graduate work at the Collegium Helveticum of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, where she pursued inter disciplinary studies in the history, philosophy, and social studies of science. She is author of Foremost in Creation: Anthropomorphism and Anthropocentrism in National Geographic Articles on Non-human Primates (2000). Before moving to the US, she spent two years at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin as a Rathenau Postdoctoral Fellow, where she was involved in the organization of the Summer Academy 2001 on Human Origins. She is working on the history of paleoanthropology, with a main interest in the development of such concepts as 'humanness', 'race', and 'sex/gender', situating the drawing of human family trees in their sociocultural context. Following one particular skel eton, anachronistically called 'The Red Lady of Paviland', from its discovery in 1823 to its most recent reinterpretation in 2000, she is interested in how extra and intra-scientific aspects influenced the way in which the bones were read, from female ancient Briton to young Cro-Magnon man, to a most central testimony of Early Upper Paleolithic humans in Britain 26,000 years ago.
