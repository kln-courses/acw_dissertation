<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> VARRO’S DIVINE ANTIQUITIES: ROMAN RELIGION AS AN IMAGE OF TRUTH peter van nuffelen The loss of varro’s Antiquitates rerum divinarum (ARD) is justifiablylamented. Of  the sixteen books of  his impressive survey of  Roman re-ligion, conceived as part of  a diptych with the twenty-five books of res humanae and generally dated in the 40s b.c.e.,1 only disconnected bits and pieces survive, mainly culled from Augustine’s De civitate Dei. This state of  affairs has not favored comprehensive interpretations. Most studies focus on a few fragments and well-known themes of  the work, like the theo- logia tripertita (naturalis, civilis, and mythica),2 or the aniconism attributed by Varro to the earliest Romans.3 Usually the work is read against the cultural and political background of  the Late Republic, when political revolution and the influx of  new, mainly Greek, ideas caused rapid changes in society and culture. Varro’s Divine Antiquities, and Roman antiquarian literature of  the Late Republic as a whole, is then understood as an attempt both to cope with the fast-changing society and to preserve the ancient heritage in the face of imminent loss.4 Varro himself  becomes the defender of  Roman religious tra- ditions, which he wants to reclaim from oblivion. Motivated by an instinctive conservative reaction in the face of  rapid changes, he intends to safeguard tradition, rites, and customs, without any regard for their possible deeper meaning. As Claudia Moatti sums it up, for Varro religion was essentially an affair of  tradition, not truth.5 As saving ancestral knowledge is the aim Varro explicitly sets out in the introduction to the work,6 there is indeed much truth in this interpretation. In this article, however, I will propose an alternative reading, which focuses on the philosophical background of  the ARD rather than on its cultural con- text. It has already been shown that the antiquarian method itself  refers back I wish to thank Professors G. Clark, P. Wiseman, and C. Gill for reading an earlier version of  this article, as well as audiences in Liverpool and Exeter, and the anonymous readers, for their comments. 1.

This new hypothesis will allow us to probe beyond Varro’s self-confessed pragmatic aim, and will correct the conclusion, drawn by those who study the ARD mainly in relation to its cultural environment, that Varro was interested in tradition for tradition’s sake. On the contrary, not only was philosophical truth not absent from ARD, it was one of  its central concerns. Indeed, according to my reading, the ARD was meant to show that the rituals, images, and priesthoods that make up Roman religion were an image of  the knowledge of  the ancients. This reading of  ARD implies that a unified philosophical project underlies the work, much more than is usually assumed. As the work is preserved in a highly fragmentary state, I will have to argue in detail for many of  the inter- pretations proposed in this paper. To make sure that my general point will not be lost to the reader, I will now give a general outline of  my interpre- tation of  Varro’s work. The fundamental characteristic of  Varro’s view on the religious past of  Rome is the integration of  a Greek philosophical view on mankind’s religious development into a standard account of  the Roman past. The Greek view originated with the early Stoics but was cast in a new form by Posidonius (c. 135–51 b.c.e.). His main point was that the earliest people were directed by philosopher-kings who had perceived the most fundamental truths about the world, and had expressed those on purpose in a veiled, sym- bolic language, like myths or poetry.8 Middle-Platonist and Stoic philosophers of  the Roman Empire would, however, stress that not only myth but also re- ligion, both Greek and foreign, is a source for primitive wisdom, and in par- ticular mystery cults.9 Contrary to early Stoic theory that stressed that only bits and pieces of  philosophy had crept into religion, poetry, and myth, this theory considered religion as a willfully created, encoded form of  philo- sophical knowledge. Detailed discussion will show that Varro accepted the main tenets of  this view, but that he had to cope with a specific problem. Rome could not pretend to be a people existing from the dawn of  time—Varro himself  having cal- culated the exact date of  the foundation of  Rome. Its religion was created in historical time. He consequently needed to link Roman religion to one of the earliest peoples who had had access to primitive wisdom. He chose the mystery cult of  Samothrace, which became the linchpin linking Roman re- ligion to Greece. Varro identified the Samothracian deities with the highest philosophical principles, with the Penates, and with the Capitoline triad. Illus- trious figures of  the Roman past, like Aeneas and Tarquinius Priscus, were brought on stage to explain the transfer of  philosophical knowledge through religion from Samothrace to Rome. He credited these central figures of  early 7. Tarver 1997, 135; Peglau 2003. 8. I follow here the interpretation of  Sen. Ep. 90.4–6 by Boys-Stones (2001, 28–43). 9.

Roman cult consequently reflected the truth in a detailed way. This integration of  the history of  Rome into a Greek history of  mankind provides the foundation for the extensive allegories of  the gods Varro proposed in the last books of  the ARD. Thus, Roman religion was a depository of  philosophical knowledge and its disintegration, or the devia- tion from established rites, would imply a loss of  truth about the cosmos. It is this philosophical attitude, I will argue, that underpins and drives Varro’s antiquarian program. Anyone arguing for the presence of  coherent ideas in the ARD is faced with two methodological problems: the fragmentary state of  the work and Varro’s apparent lack of  consistency. Both are obviously related: the fragments may give the impression that he is borrowing ideas without any concern for the ultimate coherence of  his work.10 I do not want to claim that the reading proposed here will solve every single problem within the ARD, but I hope that my hypothesis has sufficient explanatory power to make at least plausible the contention that there is a unified concept that guides the work. More- over, it can be shown that Augustine, our major source for Varro, read the ARD from a specific angle, which has led to a distorted image of  some parts of  the work. A correct appraisal of  his attitudes may provide better access to Varro’s ideas. I argue first that it is possible to detect some philosophical coherence in Varro’s allegories, which are sometimes derided for their arbitrariness and obscurity.11 This is partially due to his censure by Augustine, who especially in Books 6 and 7 of  the De civitate Dei aims at playing up the apparent inconsistencies in Varro’s interpretation of  Roman religion.12 We unavoid- ably will continue to look at Varro through the Augustinian mirror. The first part of  the article attempts to come closer to grasping Varro’s original in- tentions by understanding how his allegories were read by Augustine. The second part asks if  we can trace the metaphysics that underpin Varro’s allegories to a known source. I will suggest that, of  the two possible candi- dates, Posidionius and Varro’s teacher Antiochus of  Ascalon (died 69/8 b.c.e.), the latter is more likely, even though this is by no means certain. The third part reconstructs the historical narrative Varro develops in ARD to explain the transfer of  ancient Greek knowledge to the more recent Romans and analyzes it as a Roman version of  the Posidonian view on ancient wisdom. The last part explores how that narrative explains some of  the peculiarities of  the ARD: the stress on the willful creation of  images by ancient lawgivers and the importance attributed to philosopher-kings. My argument will draw unevenly on the various books of  the ARD, for obvious reasons. Most of  the 10. The commentary by Cardauns (1976) studiously inventorizes these apparent contradictions. 11.

The longest fragments, which also focus most on allegory, are to be found in the last two books (De dis incertis and De dis praecipuis et selectis), the main reason being the polemical interest shown by Augustine in these books. Varro on Saturn Varro’s Book 16 was dedicated to the di selecti, grouping twenty gods, some well known and others rather obscure like Orcus. His criteria for selecting precisely those twenty are not very clear. Before asking why he chose these deities, we should ask how this group was held together. From Augustine’s account it is clear that Book 16 of  ARD offered a physical allegory of  the di selecti,13 which implies that the gods were seen as symbolizing elements or parts of  the cosmos.14 Several strands of  interpretation run through the allegories propounded in Book 16. As my aim is not to provide a full overview of  Varro’s philosophy, but to show how his allegories work, I will analyze only one of  these in great detail,15 before adducing additional evidence to show that the ideas found there can be generalized. Already the first three chapters of  Book 7 of  the De civitate Dei make clear that a very prominent line of  exegesis is related to seed (semen). While discussing whether the selected gods administer a more important realm of  life, Augustine uses the example of  seed. He high- lights that many of  the di selecti seem to be related to seed and reproduc- tion, for instance, Janus, Saturn, Liber, Venus, Juno, and Ceres.16 Indeed, seed recurs in later chapters, for example, in the interpretation of  Jupiter,17 Genius,18 Liber and Ceres,19 and Saturn. Moreover, we encounter it also in other works by Varro. In the Curio de cultu deorum, a line of  Valerius Soranus (second century b.c.e.), calling Jupiter progenitor genetrixque, is explained with reference to the fact that Jupiter, being the world, both emits and receives seed—assuming at once a male and female role.20 Also, in the allegorical interpretation of  the deities in Varro’s De lingua Latina, seed is identified as a spark of  the cosmic fire.21 Semen, thus, is a key theme in Varro’s allegory. Although this point relates to most of  the di selecti, Saturn is particularly important in this respect. Augustine comments on Varro’s interpretation in the following terms: omnium seminum Saturnum et ideo seminationem quoque hominis non posse ab eius operatione seiungi 13. In particular August. De civ.

This, as we will see, is charac- terized by two elements. Firstly, Varro offers a piecemeal allegory: he freely selects individual elements of  myth, ritual, and imagery as representing aspects of  a philosophical principle, without trying to offer a coherent in- terpretation of  a myth or ritual. Secondly, the philosophical and cosmological principles he sees expressed in religion can manifest themselves on different levels of  being. In the allegory of  Saturn, we can identify three of  them: the level of  the divine, next, the human level, including human history, and, finally, the level of  nature. Augustine, from his side, tends to ignore these char- acteristics. He seems to presuppose that an allegory needs to safeguard the coherence of  the myth and that Varro is merely offering an agricultural in- terpretation of  Saturn. From the outset, Augustine’s comments tend to make us misunderstand Varro’s interpretation of  Saturn. In 7.18 the bishop says he prefers a euhemer- istic interpretation of  Jupiter’s revolt against Saturn over Varro’s “physical” one, which pretended that ideo Saturnum patrem a Iove filio superatum, quod ante est causa quae pertinet ad Iovem, quam semen quod pertinet ad Saturnum (“Saturn was overthrown by his son Jupiter because cause, which belongs to Jupiter, comes before seed, which belongs to Saturn”).23 Augustine is quick to point out that Varro is disregarding the mythological genealogy. If  Jupiter is the cause, Saturn cannot have been his father, because the father is the cause of  the son. Upholding the mythological family relations may have had some importance in Stoic24 and, later, Neoplatonic allegoresis,25 and Augustine may indeed be criticizing Varro with Neoplatonic examples in mind. But Varro clearly proceeds differently. He stresses the interaction between the characters, not the genealogy. The depiction of  Saturn, the lord of  the seed, being overthrown by Jupiter, the first cause, constitutes a mythical representation of  the precedence of  cause over seed. In the next chapter (7.19), Augustine gives an incomplete summary of Varro’s interpretation of  Saturn,26 and does so in relation to myth, ritual, and the etymology of  the god’s name. As we will see now, this is a not a single coherent interpretation of  Saturn, but rather a string of  six allegories that single out individual points in the three areas just mentioned. The first two concern the myth of  Saturn: (1) Saturn devouring his own children reflects the fact that seeds return to the place from which they spring. Augustine understands this as the natural 22.

But, in that case, he objects, Saturn should have been the earth.27 Augustine’s interpretation, followed by some modern scholars,28 is clearly wrong on two accounts. Firstly, Varro does not think Saturn is the source or receptacle of  seed. Just as in his interpretation of  Saturn’s over- throw by Jupiter, Varro is stressing the process of  insemination, which is symbolized by the god. Secondly, Varro is not simply thinking of  the natural cycle of  insemination, but also of  the cosmic cycle. In Fragment 2 of  the Curio de cultu deorum, quoted by Augustine in 7.9, Varro says of  Jupiter that he is the world, who both emits all seeds and receives them into himself.29 Insemination is a process not only involving nature but also heaven and earth, heaven producing seed, earth receiving it. If  one were to take Saturn as the heaven, which emits the seeds, one would have a contradiction between the Curio and ARD,30 and this is what Augustine wants us to believe.31 But this does not have to be the case. Saturn is not the source of  seed but sym- bolizes the cycle of  seeds, the general process of  insemination, both on the natural and the cosmic level. There is no contradiction between Jupiter in- terpreted as the world, which emits and receives all seed, and Saturn who symbolizes this process of  insemination. (2) As the second item of  Saturn’s myth, Varro allegorized the story that the god was given a lump of  earth to swallow in place of  Jupiter. He inter- preted this as the fact that “before the usefulness of  plowing was discovered, seeds were buried in the earth by human hands for sowing.”32 This inter- pretation presents a shift from the first one: Varro has moved from a more general level to agriculture specifically, and in doing so has disconnected the elements of  the myth. Whereas in the myth the swallowing of  Saturn’s children and the lump of  earth are related, in Varro’s interpretation all direct connection is lost, except for the framework of  insemination. (3) This rather obscure interpretation can only be understood with reference to the third allegory, which stays on the theme of  agriculture. Varro leaves myth and turns to the image of  Saturn. “He has a sickle, because of  agri- culture.” He explains this with reference to the Saturnian age: “His times were regarded as the earliest for the reason that the first men lived on such seeds as the earth bore untilled.”33 This interpretation and the previous one indicate that Saturn symbolizes the period of  human history when agriculture did not exist. It seems to suggest that primitive man used a sickle, but not a plow. But the interpretation is not entirely unambiguous. The previous allegory seems to imply some kind of  primitive tillage, with mankind burying the seed by hand, whereas this one excludes tillage from the Saturnian age. Possibly, we should distinguish two stages: one when the fruits of  the earth 27. August. De civ. D. 7.19, p. 297 lines 4–6 = Varro ARD frag. 242. 28. Pépin 1976, 376. 29. August. De civ.

To add to the difficulties, this model of  human history seems to conflict with that of  the Res rusticae, where Varro distinguished, in the wake of Dicaearchus of  Messene (c. 340 b.c.e.), three stages in mankind’s evolu- tion: hunting and reaping, breeding, and tillage.34 Varro’s views seem more refined in ARD, as he here apparently accepts a primitive form of  agricul- ture already in the earliest stage of  mankind. A later fragment from ARD, which shows that for Varro the attributes of  the Mother of  the Gods indicate that mankind passed from bronze tools for tillage to iron ones,35 confirms indeed that he did elaborate a very detailed view on the agricultural evolu- tion of  mankind in the Antiquitates. Whatever the solution to these problems, it seems clear that we should be aware of  the fact that Varro may have pro- posed different schemes of  agricultural evolution in different works.36 This issue is, however, of  minor importance here. It is essential to note that Varro moves freely from one level of  interpretation to another in his allegory. In this instance, he has left the cosmic and natural level for that of  mankind’s history. (4) Next Varro explains the existence of  human sacrifice to Saturn among the Carthaginians and the Gauls. The reason is that “the human race is the best of  all seeds.”37 This is too horrendous for Augustine to comment upon. It shows, however, that Varro’s interpretation extended to all historical mani- festations of  the cult of  Saturn. Even the most perverted of  rituals may con- ceal some philosophical truth—in this case, that humans are on a higher level than other beings. (5) Varro now returns to myth. Caelus’ castration by Saturn is interpreted as meaning “that the divine seed belongs to Saturn and not to Caelus.” This is explained by the fact that “nothing in heaven is produced by seed.”38 This can be taken to mean two things. Firstly, none of  the heavenly bodies is born from semina. The stars, sun, and moon are excluded from the pro- cess of  insemination, as it is symbolized by Saturn. Indeed, Varro seems to have considered them as deities, which implies that they are not generated by semen.39 Secondly, heaven is the source of  semen, an idea found both in ARD and the De lingua Latina.40 This may also explain why Varro speaks about “divine seed,” as it has a heavenly origin. However, although the cosmic seed does stem from heaven, Caelus is not explicitly identified here as the source of  the seed. Varro rather stresses the fact of  his castration, understanding it as showing that seed does not play a role in the heavens. This shows that Varro is going beyond a simple identification of  gods with 34. Varro Rust. 1.2.16, 2.1.3–5. 35. August. De civ. D. 7.24, p. 304 lines 21–23 = Varro ARD frag. 267. 36.

(6) Augustine concludes the chapter by referring to Saturn’s identifica- tion with the Greek god Cronus, which according to Varro refers to the time needed by a seed to carry fruit.41 It was not the only etymology reported by Varro. According to Tertullian, he also said that Saturn is derived from satio, meaning that through Saturn the heavenly sperms (seminalia caeli) were brought to the earth—making clear that Saturn represents the general process of  generation.42 Varro clearly distinguishes his view from the traditional in- terpretation of  Cronus as chronos, time, by specifying it as the time needed for germination.43 That Augustine reports only one etymology relating to agriculture can be adduced as additional evidence for the fact that he restricts Varro’s allegories to an agricultural interpretation. Augustine concludes the chapter by admitting that he has discussed only a few of  Varro’s interpretations: haec et alia de Saturno multa dicuntur, et ad semen omnia referuntur (“These and many other things are said about Saturn, and they all refer to seed”).44 Indeed, Varro consistently interprets all aspects of  the myth, cult, and name of  Saturn with regard to seed. The foregoing analysis reveals a discrepancy between what Augustine ex- pects of  an allegorical reading and what Varro offers him. Whereas Augustine expects a coherent interpretation of  the myth of  Saturn, Varro interprets its myth, ritual, and etymology in a piecemeal fashion. Augustine also seems to think that Varro interprets Saturn as a symbol of  agriculture, but the frag- ments from ARD and other works clearly suggest that Saturn represents a wider phenomenon. Even though we will never be able to reconstruct Varro’s allegories in full detail, it is clear that in these two respects Augustine is mis- guiding our understanding of  ARD.45 Modern accounts of  Varro’s allegory of  Saturn still often adopt the Augustinian reading.46 From what I have said, it must be clear that Saturn is not interpreted as the lord of  vegetal seeds. He symbolizes all processes of  insemination, covering all kinds of  seeds, from the cosmic cycle of  the seminalia caeli to human sperm.47 He is not seed itself, nor the source of  the seed: “He has lordship over the sowing of  all 41.

Pépin (1976, 329, 333) attempted to ascribe Tert. Ad nat. 2.12.17 and also Macrob. Sat. 1.8.6–10 to Varro, two passages that contain the traditional identification of  Cronus with time (see already Agahd 1898, 207). He is followed by Champeaux 1994, 336–37. Wifstrand Schiebe (1994, 171) is correct in doubting the Varronic origin of  the passage from Ter- tullian. Moreover, Macrob. Sat. 1.8.8 gives quite a different interpretation of  the role of  Saturn from that given by Varro in Augustine: see Syska 1993, 58–62. Consequently, both passages do not stem from Varro. 44. August. De civ. D. 7.19, p. 298 lines 15–16. 45. I leave aside the question whether Augustine willfully distorted Varro for polemical purposes or not. His way of  reading Varro may have been conditioned by the Neoplatonic allegories he was familiar with. On the other hand, the way Augustine distorts Varro is not unusual in philosophical polemic. 46. Pépin 1976, 334: “une interprétation rustique de Saturne.” 47. This is also brought out by Varro Ling. 5.64, with the interpretation of  Guittard (1978, 53–56), who shows that satus does not mean “seeds” or “sowing” in the agricultural sense but ‘l’idée plus générale de “génération,” “paternité,” “source première,” “principe générateur.” He suggests (56) that the use of  satio by Augustine and Tertullian may be due to their polemical intentions. </page> <page sequence="9"> 170 Peter Van Nuffelen seeds.”48 The general character of  Saturn’s allegory is clearly brought out by interpretations (1) and (6) above, which are statements about insemina- tion in general. Some elements of  Saturn represent more specific instances of  insemination, which relate to three areas. Firstly, there is nature and the natural cycle of  germination and growth of  plants and animals (possibly [1], and also [2] and [3]). In the second place, mankind is explicitly set apart: it is the best kind of  seed (4). Varro also discusses mankind’s agricultural evo- lution ([2] and [3]). It finally relates to divinity, but in a negative way: the heavenly bodies, traditionally seen as gods, are not born from sperm (5). It is also usually assumed that Varro is reporting or construing a Stoic exe- gesis.49 Although Varro must have known of  Stoic allegories, some major differences with traditional Stoic allegory must be noted (apart from the fact that he invented some Latin etymologies for which he evidently did not have Greek precedents). We have already noted his peculiar interpretation of Cronus, not simply as time but as time necessary for germination. His method is also quite different from a traditionally Stoic one. Cornutus, who wrote a handbook of  Stoic exegesis in the second half  of  the first century c.e., de- scribed the goal of  his allegories as follows: “To relate what is transmitted by myths about the gods to the elements (stoicheia).”50 Even though Cornutus may occasionally refer to rites,51 his main interest is in translating the mythical narrative into an account of  the physical elements. Varro is doing something different. From Augustine it is clear that he draws not only on myth and ety- mology but also on ritual and cult images. Contrary to the Stoic interest in following the mythical narrative and linking the logic of  the narrative to a philosophical logic,52 Varro develops his allegory through a piecemeal in- terpretation of  elements of  the myth, ritual, and name of  Saturn. He does not attempt to translate the myth as a whole into a philosophy; he selects indi- vidual elements in myth, ritual, and name and relates them to one of  the dif- ferent areas where the fundamental principle of  insemination manifests itself (and not to physical elements).53 Varro, Posidonius, or Antiochus of Ascalon? With the Augustinian distortions pruned away, Varro’s allegory of  Saturn reveals two specific philosophical ideas. On the one hand, Saturn is not simply a symbol of  agriculture, but personifies the general principle of  in- 48. August. De civ.

On the other, Varro relates elements of  the cult and myth of  Saturn to different levels of  reality. Both elements can be par- alleled in other allegories as well and point the way to the identification of some coherent philosophical ideas. The latter idea surfaces in a well-known fragment on the world soul. The world soul runs through both parts of  the cosmos, and is, qua structure, iden- tical to mortal souls, both being tripartite.54 The vegetative level, without sensus, is exemplified for the mortal soul by human bones or plants and trees, and for the immortal soul by stones. The next level groups what has sensus. Examples of  this are animals, and also humans with their senses, or the sun, moon, and stars for the immortal soul. The highest part of  soul is intelligence, which is the divine part of  the world soul and in which man also takes part.55 The idea of  general principles that assume different guises on different levels of  reality also explains why Varro can offer three dif- ferent interpretations of  the Capitoline triad—Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva— as heaven, earth, and Forms;56 as ratio, calor, and spiritus;57 and finally as medius aether, aer cum terra, and aetheris cacumen.58 Each time we en- counter the same fundamental triad of  metaphysical principles, but identified on different levels of  being.59 The universe disclosed by Varro’s allegories is thus governed by principles and entities (heaven, earth, Forms; insemi- nation; soul) that assume various guises depending on the level on which they manifest themselves. The prominence of  insemination in the allegories of  Book 16 of  ARD (not just Saturn but, as indicated above, eight more deities are linked to it) suggests that it was an important element in the physics expounded there. Varro’s allegory of  Saturn identifies it as a general principle that expresses itself  both on the cosmic and the natural level. By stressing that nothing in the heavens is born from seed, Varro makes clear that generation is a sub- lunary process. This is evident for the natural cycle and for agriculture. Also, the seeds from heaven inseminate only the earth, not heaven itself. On the cosmological level, insemination probably indicates the way that heaven (god) acts on passive matter. We have seen above that this was how Varro interpreted Soranus’ description of  Juppiter as progenitor and genetrix, indicating at once the active and passive principle of  the universe. The fun- damental role of  semen in this account seems identical to that of  the Stoic spermatikos logos,60 which is also the mode of  action of  the active principle on the passive, of  god on matter. The Stoics also considered the spermatikoi 54. Fladerer 1996, 106–9. 55. August. De civ. D. 7.23, p. 301 line 21–p. 302 line 9 = Varro ARD frag. 227.

The Stoic spermatikoi logoi lie at the basis of  everything in the universe, from the four elements to living beings; in Varro the action of  semen seems to be limited to the “lower” world, and nothing in heaven is created by seeds. This may be due to a Platonic influence. In the Timaeus the demiurge sows the souls of  man on the earth, stars, and moon.63 The same image of  souls falling as seeds on earth can be found in the Statesman.64 Combining dif- ferent passages from the Timaeus, later Platonist philosophers such as Plutarch widened the demiurge’s action of  sowing and ascribed to Plato the view that the demiurge sowed a portion of  vitality and divinity in matter,65 an idea that comes close to the view found in Varro’s allegories. An additional argument for a Platonist origin of  Varro’s view on insemination is that the term “di- vine seed” may be drawn from Plato’s Timaeus.66 Varro thus seems to have identified insemination as a fundamental prin- ciple explaining the action of  the active principle on the passive. Those two principles undoubtedly must be identified with heaven and earth or god and matter. Indeed, some passages indicate that he thought that the various prin- ciples of  the cosmos could be reduced to a simple dualism of  heaven and earth, god and matter, male and female. In De lingua Latina (5.57) Varro identifies Terra with Ops and Caelum with Saturnus. This seems to identify Saturn with the highest principle and contradicts the distinction between Saturn and Caelus, and between Saturn and Jupiter, defended in ARD. However, seeds being the action of  god on matter, Saturn can be taken to exemplify divine action itself, and hence the divinity, which is identified with heaven. Such a metonymic interpretation is probably also what lies behind Augustine’s muddled report of  Varro saying that all the male gods can be reduced to heaven, and all the female to earth.67 Such a dual basic principle is hardly original: it is obviously found in Stoicism, but it has been argued by David Sedley that Polemo (c. 350–276/5 b.c.e.), the successor of  Xenocrates at the head of  the Academy, already taught that god and matter were the basic principles of  the cosmos.68 61.

His cosmos is governed by the action, called insemination and probably mediated through the Forms, of  an active principle on a passive one—a basic process that can be identified on the various levels of  being. A last question in this regard must be asked: are these ideas originally Varro’s, or is he dependent on another author? It is evident that we must accept Varro’s originality in elaborating the allegories, but that does not prove that the under- lying philosophical ideas are also his. There are two possible candidates as the source of  Varro’s physics, Antiochus of  Ascalon and Posidonius, of  which the former is the more likely. As is well known, Varro had studied with Antiochus of  Ascalon (died 69/ 8 b.c.e.),69 the Academic philosopher who abandoned the skeptical tradition of  his school. He pretended to return to the true positions of  Plato, bypassing later accretions and distortions. He was convinced that Stoics and Platonists shared the same core truths in many areas, and this explains the apparent adoptions of  originally Stoic concepts into his Platonist philosophy. Varro’s allegiance to Antiochus is beyond doubt, as can be shown by his De phi- losophia. In this work Varro supported his master on the question concern- ing the highest good, a key theme in Antiochus’ thought.70 We know tantalizingly little about Antiochus’ physics, apart from a brief outline in Cicero’s Posterior Academics (1.24–30). It can only be sup- plemented by Varro’s ARD, on the supposition that it reflects Antiochean thought.71 Scholarship is divided on this issue. Antiochean provenance of  the ideas in ARD is often rejected with the argument that he is not mentioned by Varro. On the other hand, we do find a blend of  Stoic and Platonic ma- terial in the ARD and it is possible to reconcile it with Cicero’s evidence.72 The choice between both options has profound implications for our under- standing of  Antiochus’ physics. Those opting for the inclusion of  Varro’s frag- ments tend to stress more the Platonic background of  Antiochus.73 Indeed, in fragment 206 of  ARD, as we will see, Varro accepts the existence of  the Forms, which clearly points to a Platonic influence. Scholars who exclude the Varronic fragments rather stress the purely Stoic character of  Antiochus’ physics and tend to doubt that he accepted the existence of  the Forms at all.74 On such an interpretation of  Antiochus’ physics, Varro’s physics can only be attributed to Posidonius or to his own originality.75 69.

That would imply that my reconstruction of  Varro’s physics can be traced back to Antiochus.76 It is unlikely that the metaphysical system we find in ARD is made up by Varro himself, who is hardly known for his original philosophical ideas but rather as a transmitter of  Greek philosophy.77 Even though Posidonius was influenced by Plato as well, we know very little of  his possible influence on Varro, whereas Antiochus was the latter’s teacher. More- over, there is no evidence that Posidonius attributed a role to the Platonic Forms. In addition, the mix of  Stoic and Platonic elements fits the general character of  the philosophy of  Antiochus, who is known to have harked back to the Old Academy. It would be surprising if  that influence was not felt in his physics. Antiochus is known to have particularly approved of  Polemo and may have drawn on his work.78 This could explain the Platonic elements in Varro’s physics. None of  these arguments can pretend to decide the issue and I want to stress that my reading of  Varro does not depend on an Antiochean provenance of  his ideas. If  one rejects it, it simply will be less easy to situate Varro in the general development of  ancient philosophy. Roman Religion and Primitive Wisdom Whatever the precise origin of  the physics expressed in them, Varro’s alle- gories imply that in his eyes philosophical knowledge could be found in Roman religion. The obvious question is how this came about. How does it happen that philosophical truth is transmitted through religion? The issue was clearly important enough to be addressed in Varro’s introduction to Book 16 of  ARD. It is worth quoting its first fragment in full: primum eas interpretationes sic Varro commendat, ut dicat antiquos simulacra deorum et insignia ornatusque finxisse, quae cum oculis animadvertissent hi, qui adissent doc- trinae mysteria, possent animam mundi ac partes eius, id est deos veros, animo videre; quorum qui simulacra specie hominis fecerunt, hoc videri secutos, quod mortalium animus, qui est in corpore humano, simillimus est immortalis animi; tamquam si vasa poneretur causa notandorum deorum et in Liberi aede oenophorum sisteretur, quod sig- nificaret vinum, per id quod continet id quod continetur; ita per simulacrum, quod formam haberet humanam, significari animam rationalem, quod eo velut vase natura ista soleat contineri, cuius naturae deum volunt esse vel deos. First of  all, Varro commends these interpretations so highly as to say that the men of old invented the images, attributes and adornments of  the gods precisely so that, when those who had approached the mysteries of  the doctrine had seen these visible things with their eyes, they might also see with their mind the soul of  the world and its parts; that is, the true gods. He also says that those who made the images of  the gods in human form seem to have believed that the mortal mind that exists in the human body is very similar to the immortal mind. It is as if  vessels were placed to represent the gods: as, for 76. See Cic. Acad. post. 1.24. 77. As suggested by, e.g., Kleywegt 1972, 39–45. See Tarver 1997, for Varro as an intelligent transmitter. 78. Cic. Luc. 131; Sedley 2002, 52. In view of  Antiochus’ reconciliation of  Stoicism and Platonism, it is significant that Polemo was the teacher of  Zeno, the founder of  Stoicism (Diog. Laert. 7.1). </page> <page sequence="14"> Varro’s Divine Antiquities 175 example, a wine-jar might be placed in the temple of  Liber, to signify wine, that which is contained being signified by that which contains. Thus, the rational soul was signi- fied by an image which had a human form, because the human form is, so to speak, the vessel in which that nature is wont to be contained which they wish to attribute to God, or to the gods.79 Varro offers a twofold basis for the presence of  truth in religion. In the first place, religion was invented by the antiqui, who clothed the true gods (the world soul and its different manifestations) in what had become for Varro’s contemporaries traditional imagery. The role of  these ancients is important and remarkable. Contrary to early Stoic theory,80 this fragment gives the impression that names and images of  the gods did not come into being naturally or by accident, but were intentionally created (finxisse) by the “ancients.” Secondly, the use of  anthropomorphic images is grounded in the fundamental likeness of  the mortal soul and the immortal one, which must be identified with the world soul.81 This refers back to what we have said on the parallel tripartition of  the world soul and its mortal counterpart,82 and also to man’s special position as the only being that partakes in intel- ligence. Obviously, not only the symbolic content of  the image refers to the structure of  the cosmos, but also the type of  image—an idea one often finds in later texts.83 Both elements guarantee that the figurative aspect of  religion does not disfigure the truth contained in it. A related problem is how the truth can be retrieved from religion. First, Varro implies that the choice of  images is a deliberate and precise process, which is based on the essential likeness between the signifiant and signifié. On the other hand, he does admit that only the wise, those “who have approached the mysteries of  the doctrine,” can recognize the truth. With the creation of images, religion can be read on two levels: an immediate level that is simply visual, and a higher philosophical level that goes beyond the images. It is obviously implied that the second way of  reading is the better, and, more- over, that philosophical knowledge is a precondition of  recognizing the real meaning. So even though religion may contain the same truth as philosophy, the latter discipline is essential for finding the wisdom hidden in religion. Thus, the priority of  philosophy, not only theoretical but also historical, grounds the allegory: the knowledge that allegory retrieves from figurative images was originally “hidden” there by wise philosophers (the antiqui), but philosophy is also needed to come to a correct allegory. It takes wisdom to decode primitive wisdom. This recalls what we have earlier said about Varro’s allegories of  the di selecti, where coherence was indeed provided by the underlying philosophical ideas. 79. August. De civ. D. 7.5, p. 280 lines 8–21 = Varro ARD frag. 225, trans. Dyson 1998, 274. 80. See Boys-Stones 2001; Goulet 2005. 81. As the following quotation of  Varro in Augustine shows: August. De civ.

He even entertained the possibility that Varro believed in an “efficacité télestique” of  statues. Varro is, however, probably using a principle of  Antiochus’ philosophy. 83. E.g., Dio Chrys. Or. 12.59; Maximus of  Tyre Or. 2.3. </page> <page sequence="15"> 176 Peter Van Nuffelen Fragment 225 focuses on Roman religion and images, but the allegory of Saturn, as analyzed above, allows one to extend the topic to other religions and types of  evidence as well. As we have seen, in this allegory, Varro drew on foreign rituals, such as the sacrificial rites of  the Carthaginians and the Gauls. Varro thus probably considered Roman religion as just one example of  a worldwide process of  transition from a philosophical to a “traditional” religion. All religions and their different expressions, he suggests, contain philosophical truth. References to Judaism in the first book imply the same attitude.84 Moreover, he also allegorized myth, ritual, and names, and not only cult statues. This implies that the antiqui did not only create images, but were probably also responsible for the truth hidden in other religious expressions. Notwithstanding the general idea of  all religions as loci of  truth, there seems to be one specific Greek cult that is more highly valued: the Samothracian mysteries, which are taken to have preserved knowledge of  the highest phi- losophical principles. The number of  fragments of  the ARD referring to this cult is remarkable,85 especially given the fact that it actually falls, as a Greek cult, outside the scope of  the work. Samothrace is central to Varro’s argument for two main reasons: he identifies it at once as the symbolic representation of  the highest philosophical principles and as the origin of  the most impor- tant Roman deities. In that way, he succeeds in linking Rome to Greece, and more specifically to one of  its most ancient cult centers. A fragment from Book 15 explicitly attributes the knowledge of  the highest philosophical principles to the Samothracian mysteries. hinc etiam Samothracum nobilia mysteria in superiore libro sic interpretatur eaque se, quae nec Sais nota sunt, scribendo expositurum eisque missurum quasi religiosissime pollicetur. dicit enim se ibi multis indiciis collegisse in simulacris aliud significare caelum, aliud terram, aliud exempla rerum, quas Plato appellat ideas; caelum Iovem, terram Iunonem, ideas Minervam vult intellegi; caelum a quo fiat aliquid, terram de qua fiat, exemplum secundum quod fiat. Hence also, in the preceding book, Varro similarly interprets the celebrated mysteries of  the Samothracians, and promises, almost with religious fervor, that he will expound in writing things unknown to the local priests and send those to them. For he says that he had discovered in Samothrace, from many indications, that one of  the images there signified the heaven, another the earth, and another the model of  things which Plato calls Forms. Varro wishes it to be understood that Jupiter is the heaven, Juno the earth, and Minerva the Forms: heaven being that by which anything is made; earth being that of  which it is made; and the ideas being the form according to which it is made.86 Although clearly different in kind, this interpretation works on the same principles as Varro’s allegory of  the cult of  Saturn. But the mysteries of Samothrace are clearly of  a higher order. The images kept there symbolize 84. Varro ARD frag. 15–17. 85. See frags. 205, 206, and XVa. See also Curio frag. I and Ling. 5.57–58.

These are, as I have argued, the fundamental metaphysical prin- ciples of  Varro’s physics (and possibly also those of  Antiochus of  Ascalon), to which almost all other principles can be reduced. Varro seems to have attached great importance to the correct interpreta- tion of  the Samothracian deities. Augustine describes his tone as quasi re- ligiosissime, and reports that Varro pretended to know better than the priests of  the island themselves who their gods were and what they symbolized. Moreover, in De lingua Latina Varro explicitly rejects the usual identifica- tion of  the Samothracian gods with Castor and Pollux.87 In this last passage, Varro identifies the Samothracian deities only with terra and caelum, taking the one as anima and the other as corpus.88 This apparent contradiction has puzzled many scholars,89 but Ludwig Fladerer has argued that Varro, in the wake of  Antiochus, sees Minerva as part of  Jupiter.90 Varro’s claim of  knowing better than the Samothracians themselves what their statues signify, is fully in accordance with the principles of  allegoriza- tion he laid out in fragment 225. He possesses the necessary philosophical knowledge to come to the correct interpretation—a knowledge apparently lost to the priests of  the island. He even goes so far as to disregard the tra- ditional convention that there were only two Samothracian deities: his phi- losophy tells him there must be three.91 The reasons for Varro’s insistence on the correct identification and number of  these gods become clear in fragment 205, also from Book 15, where the Capitoline triad is identified with the Penates and linked to Samothrace: Penates esse per quos penitus spiramus et corpus habemus et animi rationes possidemus: eos autem esse Iovem aethera medium, Iunonem imum aera cum terra, summum aetheris cacumen Minervam. quos Tarquinius Demarati Corinthi filius, Samothraciis religionibus mystice imbutus, uno templo et sub eodem tecto coniunxit. The Penates are the gods through which we breathe, have a body, and possess reason in the soul. They are Jove, middle aether, Juno, the lower air with earth, and the highest part of  the aether, Minerva. Tarquinius, son of  Demaratus the Corinthian and initiate of the Samothracian mysteries, joined them in one temple and under one roof.92 The Samothracian deities are identical to the Capitoline triad, who are in turn identified with the Penates, the mysterious but all-important Roman deities whose identity was much discussed at the time.93 By dint of  this iden- tification, Roman religion matches philosophy very closely: not only do the Roman gods and cults symbolize the true structure of  the cosmos, as suggested 87.

Varro does not simply affirm the identification of  the highest Roman gods with the gods of  Samothrace; he is also at pains to provide historical evi- dence for how the transfer of  the gods (and of  philosophical knowledge) came about. In the fragments of  his works we find a double historical link. The original link is Aeneas. According to Varro, Dardanus, the forefather of  the founder of  Troy, had brought the Penates from Samothrace to Troy, and later Aeneas carried the Penates from Phrygia to Italy.94 Although this version is original to Varro,95 he was able to draw both on an earlier Greek tradition and a Roman one to concoct it. Already Hellanicus (early fifth century b.c.e.) had said that Dardanus came from Samothrace before going to Troy.96 Cal- listratus (first century b.c.e.), who wrote a history of  Samothrace, and is quoted by Dionysius of  Halicarnassus, provides an even more impressive pedigree. Chryse, daughter of  Pallas, when married to Dardanus brought as dowry the gifts of  Athena: the Palladia and the sacred symbols shown in the mysteries of  the Great Gods. Dardanus, fleeing the deluge, settled on Samo- thrace, built a temple, and created the mysteries. He left the mysteries on the island but took the Palladia and the images of  the gods with him.97 It is not impossible that Varro knew Callistratus’ account, linking Samothrace to Athens, and referred to it. In the Roman tradition, already Cassius Hemina (middle second century b.c.e.) thought that the Penates came directly from Samothrace.98 Varro seems to have combined the Greek account, linking Samothrace and Troy, and the Roman account, identifying the Penates with the mysterious divinities of  the island. The second historical link was Tarquinius Priscus (traditionally dated to 616–578 b.c.e.), who, according to the fragment quoted above, had been initiated in the mysteries of  Samothrace, and constructed the temple on the Capitol. It is clearly implied that Tarquinius, through his initiation, had knowl- edge of  the philosophical principles hidden in the Samothracian mysteries (a knowledge that apparently was not yet lost at that time). Consequently, he united in one temple the Capitoline triad, who were the oldest Roman gods according to Varro,99 and in that way visualized the central role these principles had in the cosmos. The temple, created through inspiration from Samothrace, affirmed visually that the highest gods of  Roman religion were indeed the highest principles of  philosophy. Varro’s interest in Samothrace is too pervasive to be accidental. No other foreign cult figures so prominently in ARD and in the narrative of  cultic transfer that Varro develops in it. On a theoretical plane he identifies the 94. Serv. ad Aen. 1.378, 2.325, 3.148; Macrob. Sat. 3.4.7. Kleywegt (1972, 5–7) gives all the texts. Dion. Hal. Ant.

The stories about Aeneas and Tarquinius Priscus in turn provide a historical narrative that explains how the knowl- edge present in Samothrace was transferred to Rome. In that way Varro turns Samothrace into the major ancestor of  Roman religion. It is unclear why Varro chose Samothrace to fulfill that particular role. Why did he not choose, for example, Athens, for many the center of  Greek culture? It is usually pointed out that Samothrace already enjoyed notoriety in Roman society and was probably the best-known Greek mystery cult in Rome besides Eleusis. Indeed, many Romans were initiated there from the second century b.c.e. onward,100 and Varro himself  had visited the place in 67 b.c.e.101 But there is an additional element to be taken into account. Varro may have been aware of  a Greek tradition, reported in Diodorus, that tends to make Samothrace the origin of  all mystery cults.102 In ARD Varro may have championed similar ideas. In a passage that may draw on Varro, because of  its similarities to Varro’s account of  the origins of  Troy, Dionysius of  Halicarnassus links Samothrace to yet another mystery cult. He tells how the Trojans, having come from Arcadia, lived in Samothrace, before moving on to Phrygia, where they founded the cult of  the Mother of  the Gods.103 This is probably no accident. The Mother of  the Gods is, with Eleusis and Samothrace, the only foreign cult discussed at length in the ARD, where she is identified with Tellus and explained as a representation of  insemination.104 It is impossible to prove, but in the light of  the present discussion not unlikely, that the link with Samothrace provided for Varro a justification of  the in- troduction of  this cult in 204. Being a direct offspring of  the source of  truth, Samothrace, the cult of  the Mother of  the Gods, just like the Penates or the Capitoline triad, may have been considered to be in line with the underlying philosophical principles of  Roman religion, and, consequently, could be safely adopted in Rome.105 As Samothrace was a mystery cult, the previous conclusion brings up the question whether Varro attributed any special status to mystery cults in gen- eral. Given the fragmentary nature of  the work, any answer remains fraught with doubts. Probably the idea did not figure very prominently in ARD, which studies the earliest phase of  Roman religion at a time when mystery cults did not play any role. However, Varro seems to be aware of  a Greek idea that mystery cults contain a higher degree of  truth. Fragment 21 bears witness to this: 100. See, e.g., Cic. Nat. D. 119, or, later, Galen, De usu partium I, p. 418 lines 20–27, II, p. 448 lines 5–9. Cf.

In his Menippean satires, Varro criticized oriental cults, but this relates rather to the improper be- havior of  the devotees. This does not exclude them from representing the truth. Lehmann (1997, 267–68) surveys the material. </page> <page sequence="19"> 180 Peter Van Nuffelen ipse diceret de religionibus loquens multa esse vera, quae non modo vulgo scire non sit utile, sed etiam, tametsi falsa sunt, aliter existimare populum expediat, et ideo Graecos teletas ac mysteria taciturnitate parietibusque clausisse. Talking about religions, he said himself  that there are many truths which it is not useful for the common people to know, and, moreover, that there are many false views which it is expedient that people should take to be true. This, he says, is why the Greeks held their initiations and mysteries in secret and behind closed doors.106 Apart from its elitist tendency, the fragment implies that mystery cults contain a higher philosophical truth than other cults. Varro indeed says that many vera are hidden from the common people in mystery cults: mystery cults shield the truth from the uninitiated. He was thus aware of  a Greek view that mystery cults contain a higher degree of  truth than ordinary cults. This fragment suggests that outside mystery cults many lies are presented as truth to the people, which may be useful if  believed. It seems to imply that other religious cults contain some untruth. The original philosophical religion may have been slightly distorted with impure accretions. One might think that this is due to misinterpretations of  cult images by people who lack the right philosophical knowledge. It is an idea, however, that does not surface often in other fragments of  ARD. Only fragment 47 distinguishes between superstitio, identified with the attitude timere, and religio, expressed in vereri. The element of  untruth in religion may be the fact that it inspires fear for divine punishment in man, and consequently is morally useful. Again one cannot be certain that superstition is not a major theme in ARD, but its relative absence may be due to the fact that the work is concerned with the earliest phase of  Roman religion that was the most pure. Apart from the special position attributed to Samothrace, the idea of  mys- tery cults as loci of  truth does not play an important role in the ARD. Varro does not give a prominent place to Eleusis, the only other Greek mystery cult mentioned: Proserpina is simply seen as symbolizing the seminum fecund- itatem, and the entire cult is interpreted ad frugum inventionem.107 A very brief  reference, however, to the fact that the Chaldaeans, “in their mysteries,” use the name Iao for the Jewish god, who is identical to the highest god, can be taken to show that Varro stressed on at least one additional occasion the link between mysteries and the highest truth.108 As yet I have identified in this part of  my paper three elements of  Varro’s view on the origins of  Roman religion. First, as shown by fragment 225, he attributes the creation of  cult images (and, I have argued, probably of  all elements of  traditional religion) to the deliberate intention of  “ancients.” Second, the mysteries of  Samothrace are identified as the source of  the major Roman deities, which Varro identifies with the highest philosophical principles. This thesis is embedded in a historical narrative explaining how 106. August. De civ. D. 4.31, p. 186 lines 1–5 = Varro ARD frag. 21, trans. Dyson 1998, 182. 107. August. De civ.

Finally, Varro seems to accept a close link between mystery cults and truth, an idea that he traces back to Greece. It may seem obscure at first sight how these various elements belong together, and one might be tempted to attribute it to the confused mind of a collectioneur who got embroiled in too wide a range of  material. In my opinion, however, these three ideas are part of  a coherent narrative on the origins of  Roman religion, which must be analyzed as the result of  Varro’s conflation of  the Greek philosophical view about primitive wisdom and a traditional history of  early Rome. Varro accepts the basic tenets of  the Greek view, which I earlier identified as of  possibly Posidonian origin before it passed on to the Middle Platonists. Summarized briefly, it held that the kings of  the ancients, being wise phi- losophers, deliberately created the images, rituals, and names of  the gods, with their eyes fixed on philosophical truth. Mystery cults contain a higher degree of  truth than other cults; being closed to non-initiates, they apparently preserve primitive wisdom better than other religious expressions.109 Con- temporary philosophers considered ancient wisdom lost as common knowl- edge in their time, when one now needed philosophical training to be able to interpret cult images and myths correctly.110 All of  this is present in Varro: the deliberate creation of  religion by ancients in line with philosophy, the identification of  philosophical truth in ancient cults like Samothrace, and the close link between mystery cults and truth. It is interesting to note that Varro is actually the first to adopt the idea of  primitive wisdom in a Platonist context, and to identify religion as the major source for this wisdom.111 If one accepts that Varro is dependent on Antiochus of  Ascalon in ARD, as I suggested above, it is even possible that Varro encountered this idea in the writings of  his master. Posidonius’ philosopher-kings lived in an undefined period before historical time.112 In adopting this view, Varro was confronted with a particular problem. Rome could not pretend to be one of  the peoples that had existed from the origin of  time, as it was founded at a specific moment in history. Varro thus had to link Rome’s religion to that of  the more ancient peoples. This was done by identifying the Samothracian mysteries (in a later Platonist author listed among the most ancient peoples113) as the fountain of  wisdom, and then by providing historical links with important Romans like Aeneas and Tarquinius Priscus. The Samothracian cult functions as the main foreign contributor to Roman religion: the Penates, the Capitoline triad, and, in a derived way, also 109. This may enhance our understanding of  fragment 225, where it is said that only hi, qui adissent doctrinae mysteria can have a full understanding of  the truth of  the images. It does not have to be more than a traditional comparison of  the acquisition of  philosophical knowledge to initiation in the mysteries. But in the light of  the prominent role played by the Samothracian mysteries, it can also be an oblique reference to the mystery cults as loci of  truth. 110. Detailed discussion of  this Greek view can be found in Boys-Stones 2001, for the philosophical background, and Van Nuffelen 2007, for its application to religion. 111. According to Boys-Stones (2001, 99–122), Cornutus (first century c.e.) is the first author in whose work we can grasp the view of  primitive wisdom after Posidonius. But Varro clearly precedes him. 112. Sen. Ep. 90.5–6. 113. Celsus, in Origen C. Cels. 1.14.

Even though Rome may have been a latecomer, Varro managed to attribute a degree of  truth to its religion that was as high as that of  any Greek cult. He even suggests, by criticizing the Samothracians for having forgotten the true meaning of  their statues, that Rome is now a better place to look for philosophical truth in religion. Philosopher-Kings and Aniconism If  one accepts my analysis of  Varro’s views on the history of  Roman religion, some of  its other peculiar features can be more easily understood. A con- sequence of  Varro’s attempt to integrate a Greek philosophical view and Roman history is that he situates the changes in religion, which Posidonius tended to put beyond the scope of  history, in historical time. Religion is for Varro a historical creation114 that can be precisely dated. This is particularly clear in two areas: Varro attributes an important role in this process to inspired philosopher-kings and he stresses the deliberate creation of  cult images at a certain point in time. Both in fragment 225 and in the fragments concerned with the Samo- thracian cult, images are at the centre of  Varro’s interest. In the former, Varro describes how the antiqui made anthropomorphic images of  the gods as a figurative representation of  the structure of  the cosmos, whereas in the latter he gives the true interpretation of  the images preserved in this mystery cult. This must be connected with the famous fragment 18, from the first book of  ARD, where Varro states that the Romans worshipped the gods with- out figurative images (sine simulacro) for 170 years.115 As shown by the re- marks of  Augustine preceding the fragment, this implies that in the earliest period the Romans worshipped philosophical principles directly or through nonfigurative images.116 The period of  170 years allows the dating of  the introduction of  anthropomorphic images in Rome in the reign of  Tarquinius Priscus.117 This is probably no coincidence: as seen in our discussion of  the Samothracian cult, Tarquinius was an initiate of  this cult and had constructed the temple on the Capitol. He was well placed to organize the earliest Roman cult and its imagery according to the highest philosophical principles. This suggests that Varro’s antiqui are not unknown ancestors, but important figures of  Roman history. He seems to attribute a role of  paramount impor- tance to inspired legislators in the development of  Roman religion118—in- spired not in the sense that they had received direct divine revelation, but 114. As he affirms explicitly in ARD frag. 5 = August. De civ. D. 6.4, p. 250 lines 17–20. 115. August. De civ. D. 4.31, p. 186 lines 21–29; cf. Plut. Num. 8.65bc = Varro ARD frag. 18. 116. August.

This may also reflect upon a much-discussed passage of  De lingua Latina (5.7–8), where Varro distinguishes four levels of  explaining language, the third being that of  the philosopher and the fourth that of  the king. In relation to the level of  the king, there is also a reference to mystery cults. This strongly recalls the position of  philosopher-kings like Tarquinius Priscus, initiate of  Samothrace, in relation to the creation of  Roman religion. The major difference is, however, that in this passage the king is on a higher level than the philosopher, whereas in ARD king and philosopher are identified. For a bibliography and discussion of this passage, see Lehmann 1997, 307; Cardauns 2001, 56. </page> <page sequence="22"> Varro’s Divine Antiquities 183 that they were fully conscious of  the truth hidden in religion. It is probably no accident that the figures that are explicitly mentioned all have a clear link with Greece. This is evident for Aeneas, and also for Tarquinius Priscus, initiate in the mysteries of  Samothrace. The same is true for Numa, whom Varro explicitly linked with Pythagoras. On his orders, the Penates were de- posited in the newly constructed temple of  Vesta. Dionysius of  Halicarnassus, who tells the story, gives as one of  the explanations for the continuously burning fire in the temple that fire was the most pure element.119 He may be reflecting Varro here, who indeed held the world soul to be of  a fiery nature,120 and who considered, as we have seen, the heavenly semina to be little sparks of  fire. Moreover, Varro also identified Vesta with fire for human use.121 The action of  Numa, then, linked the essential element of  fire to the fundamental principles of  the cosmos—god, matter, and ideas—represented by the Penates. Although we have seen that he ascribes awareness of  ancient truth to other peoples as well, such as the Jews, such stories suggest that for Varro Roman religion was directly inspired by Greek philosophy. In Varro’s view, aniconism was related to the earlier and better stages of human history and he consequently valued it higher than the image worship of  his time. His preference returns often in his work. Fragment 254 of  ARD identifies Mars with a lance; in the Res humanae the Penates are described as sigilla lignea vel marmorea,122 even though contemporaries pretended they were represented by the images of  two young men.123 Ancient aniconism was not limited to the Romans. From De gente populi romani, which dates the creation of  the first cult to after the deluge, we can gather that indeed all ancient peoples worshipped originally without figurative images, and also that before the deluge there were no images at all.124 In ARD, Varro praises in particular the Jews and some unspecified barbarians for having maintained their aniconic cult up to his day;125 they still stick to a purer stage of  worship. The fact that Varro sees figurative images as conscious creations from the time of  Tarquinius and not as the result of  a natural development raises the question why they were created at all. To this the extant fragments do not give an answer. Scholars have surmised that images were created for the plebs, whereas the elite could worship the philosophical principles directly.126 Some fragments do indeed indicate the dangers of  idol worship: it can deflect the attention from the true focus of  worship127 and inspire fear and error,128 and in that way give rise to superstition. Obviously, then, the aniconic stage of  Roman religion is more highly valued, as it is worship without other means 119. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 2.66.2–5. 120. Tert. Ad nat. 2.219 = Varro ARD frag. 23.

I am not convinced that this link can be made. None of  the fragments says, strictly speaking, that simulacra were created specifically for the common people, even though they do indicate the dangers of  statues and stress that they can make people deviate from the right worship.131 Incorrect worship is a possible conse- quence of  cult images, stresses Varro, for people unable to perceive their true meaning. He does not say that figurative images were created with the purpose of  providing a religion for the people. By seeing the creation of  such images as the willful creation of  a “popular religion,” we may be substitut- ing cause for consequence. The truth is that Varro nowhere gives an explicit justification for the creation of  figurative images. Instead of  adding more speculation to the topic, I want to sketch how their deliberate creation was essential for Varro’s views about Roman religion and his use of  allegory. Varro’s view on images is not simply negative. He is indeed aware of their dangers, but, on the other hand, Varro does not seem to consider any image or ritual inappropriate. As the allegory of  Saturn shows, they all re- flect a particular aspect of  a philosophical principle. Even immoral rituals such as human sacrifice at Carthage do contain philosophical knowledge. Moreover, fragment 225 clearly states that the choice of  anthropomorphic images is due to the fact that human intelligence is an earthly image of  the world soul, and is, consequently, not accidental. Varro does not seem to assume that some rituals or cult images are mere accretions to the philo- sophical core, and should be cut out of  religion. All images and rituals seem to be conscious creations reflecting philosophical knowledge.132 This atti- tude can be explained in the light of  Varro’s wide-ranging allegories, which apparently salvage all cult images and ritual. They can only work on the assumption that no rituals or images are the result of  superstition or of  a lack of  knowledge, but are all created by wise leaders who are aware of  the philosophical knowledge. Moreover, this creation needed to happen in his- torical time, as Roman religion in its entirety was created in historical time. Varro consequently had to situate the creation of  anthropomorphic images at a specific point in time. Thus, his affirmation that philosophical kings such as Tarquinius created statues is the necessary foil for his allegorical reading of  images, as it provides a justification for his allegories.133 A preceding aniconic stage is the logical consequence.134 Rather than being a real his- 129.

Apol. 25.12 = Varro ARD frag. 38 links the creation of  images to superstition, but Cardauns (1976, ad loc.) is right in thinking the reference to superstition an addition of  the Christian apologist. 132. There is consequently no contradiction between Varro’s earlier praise of  aniconism (ARD frags. 18 and 22) and his positive appraisal of  cult images in fragment 225, as Cardauns (1976, 226) thinks. 133. If  we take the agricultural development as sketched in the Res divinae as an example, one can also think of  the creation of  images as merely a necessary stage in the gradual development of  mankind (no images, aniconic images, traditional images). Varro was clearly fond of  distinguishing stages. 134. There is no contradiction between aniconism and allegory (contra Cardauns 1976, 147). </page> <page sequence="24"> Varro’s Divine Antiquities 185 torical stage in Roman religion, as used to be thought by scholars,135 early Roman aniconism is a result of  the philosophical framework of  the ARD. Conclusion My interpretation of  Varro’s ARD, which has stressed his dependence on the Posidonian concept of  primitive wisdom, implies that we should reconsider the traditional interpretation according to which he preferred tradition over truth and traditional religion over philosophy. On the contrary, for Varro tradition is an image of  philosophical truth. This will become clear with a brief  discussion of  the most famous doctrine of  the ARD: the three types of theology (mythica, civilis, and naturalis). Throughout the fragments, it is clear that he rejects the theologia mythica, a product of  poets, who want to please the audience, not to tell the truth.136 Varro’s opinion on their untruth becomes clear in his consistent rejection of  the mythical genealogies in his allegories,137 as we have seen in our discussion of  Saturn. The myths may contain some truth, but poets have tried to make a nice story out of  it, and, consequently, have distorted the truth. Contrary to the pontiff  Scaevola,138 however, Varro does not reject theologia naturalis in favor of  theologia civilis. His only “critique” of  the former is that it is too highbrow for most people,139 and that the philosophers do not succeed in agreeing.140 A return to the pure theologia naturalis is impossible, admits Varro, and consequently we must stick to the historically formed tradition.141 But theologia civilis is not without its problems either. As indicated above, cult images may induce people into error and lead them to superstition. This is, however, not due to the fact that images would be wrong representations of  the ancient wisdom.142 Rather, as ordinary people lack the necessary philosophical knowledge, they easily start to believe that the cult image is the true form of  the god. Apparently, we witness two conflicting loyalties in Varro’s mind: one toward pure worship of  philosophy, and another toward Roman tradition. Scholarship has traditionally stressed his final preference for the latter over the former.143 Without wishing to underestimate the differences between the two theologies,144 I think, however, that it would be a mistake to overstress 135.

This is, possibly, another indication that Varro, and through him Antiochus, adhered to the above-sketched view on primitive wisdom, as in it the quarrels between philosophical schools were seen as a sign of  the loss of  this wisdom. Antiochus wanted to lift himself  above these controversies. Quarelling philosophers are consequently not a sign that the theo- logia naturalis is flawed, but a statement by Varro that he will deliver the only truthful view and transcend the errors of  the others. See Boys-Stones 2001, 123–50. 141. August. De civ. D. 4.32, p. 185 lines 18–29 = Varro ARD frag. 12. 142. Cardauns (1976, 145) seems mistaken in thinking that according to Varro the images of  the theologia civilis were inspired by the poetical narratives. None of  the fragments he refers to (12–19) imply this. 143. Lehmann (1997, 223–24). I do not notice the suspicion of  Varro towards the theologia naturalis he sees. 144. See the works in n. 2 above for detailed assessments of  the various theologies. </page> <page sequence="25"> 186 Peter Van Nuffelen them: ultimately they are two different forms of  the same truths. In content theologia civilis and naturalis are identical. It is consequently wrong to sup- pose that Varro preferred theologia civilis to theologia naturalis, as many modern scholars do, or to think, like Augustine, that it was through fear for popular reactions that he did not reveal the untruth of  theologia civilis.145 Both theologies represent the same truth, only their forms are different, theologia naturalis possessing a purer one than theologia civilis. The close link between both theologies also becomes clear from the fact that they both represent a historical stage: theologia naturalis was clearly the earliest form of  religion, and it was succeeded by theologia civilis. The mythical theology, however, never represented a historical stage, and is only partially an image of  truth. Theologia naturalis and theologia civilis also share a similar set of  problems: both are not readily present in pure form. A clear perception of  philosophical truths is obscured by disagreement among phi- losophers, whereas the visual nature of  the theologia civilis makes the truth only indirectly accessible (not to mention the possibility of  superstitious additions to the forms created by the ancients). Once we understand the re- lationship between both theologies in this way, it is hardly surprising that Varro concluded a work apparently aimed at collecting all that is known about the theologia civilis with an extensive discussion of  the theologia naturalis that lies behind it. ARD does not only propose to inventorize the theologia civilis, but to show that it is formed in accordance with the philosophical truth. In Roman religion, as reconstructed by Varro in ARD, tradition was just another expression of  the truth. The fragmentary state of  ARD does not allow us to grasp all details of Varro’s ideas. From the preceding pages, however, it must have become clear that it is possible to discern a philosophical framework behind Varro’s anti- quarianism, both in terms of  the physics behind the allegories of  Book 16 and in terms of  the historical narrative about Roman religion. As I have argued, both are closely linked, the historical narrative providing the justification of the allegories. Roman cult images can only be read as containing truths about the cosmos because Roman legislators have created their religion in line with the ancient truth found in Greece. This strongly suggests that ARD is more than a simple collection of  evidence about Roman religion, but a work written with a philosophical program behind it. I do not wish to deny the antiquarian character of  ARD nor to suggest that antiquarianism is just the vehicle for Varro’s philosophical convictions. On the contrary, tradition was the em- bodiment of  truth for Varro. ARD is not just an inventory of  Roman religion but also an extended argument in favor of  its truthfulness. Philosophy and antiquarianism are consequently not two contradictory intellectual impulses, nor do tradition and truth contradict each other: antiquarian research helps to uncover the philosophical truth hidden in religion.
