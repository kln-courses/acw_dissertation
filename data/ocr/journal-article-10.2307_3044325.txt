<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Interpretation of "Adam Bede" ALBERT J. FYFE A LTHOUGH GEORGE ELIOT'S Adam Bede is firmly estab- lished as a "Victorian classic," and is one of her best-known titles, this work has diminished appeal nowadays. In a poll made some years ago among British students, Adam Bede ranked high in the list of "most disliked" books. For some present-day readers neither the author's vivid picture of old-fashioned country life in the Mid- lands nor the comic characters such as Mrs. Poyser or Bartle Massey can compensate for the Hetty Sorrel story, which is taken to be a typical piece of smug Victorian moralizing; and in this view Adcam Bede becomes little more than a tract warning pretty young girls that their unconsidering beauty may in the end betray them. It is of course more than that. One could ignore its didacticism, and find ample reward in the story, in George Eliot's narrative technique, already fairly mature. But an examination of the drift of thought or "thesis" of Adam Bede may well repay the effort. In sum, Hetty Sorrel was an uneducated country lass of seven- teen years, possessing little intelligence or common sense but a full measure of beauty, a combination which brought her into the shadow of the gallows, to exile and death. The question is, could ignorant Hetty in fairness be held responsible for her ac- tions ? Was it not inevitable that after attracting the attention of the local squire's grandson she should have been seduced and deserted? Then, a despairing outcast, she abandoned her newborn child in a wood, and was later charged with infanticide, but all this was the consequence of her first mistake. Hetty scarcely gains the reader's Albert J.

Yet he is likely to feel-irrel- evantly, as we shall see-that Hetty was punished too severely, perhaps in conformity with the Victorian convention that fallen woman, repentant or not, must be harried to her grave, as in fact Hetty was. We learn in the "Epilogue" of the death of the "poor wanderer" beyond the seas. R. H. Hutton, P. Bourl'honne and others argued that George Eliot might have lost her faith in her Coventry days, but that the Evangelical prepossessions of her early youth returned with re- newed vigor during her novelistic career. Such critics cannot see any satisfactory basis for so much preaching by an author who was an avowed sceptic: they suggest that she was tormented by inner doubts concerning her relationship with Lewes, and so made Hetty and others of her characters atone vicariously for the burden on her own conscience. This plausible generalization does not do justice to George Eliot. The ethics of her novels are not primarily Christian but are natu- ralistic and based on the theories of certain contemporary rational- ists. Addam Bede seems orthodox enough: we read of sin, confession, repentance, and the like, but the work actually exemplifies the utilitarian system of George Eliot's friend Charles Bray. At the very time she was beginning Adam Bede, in November, I857, she was discussing with Bray his work, The Philosophy of Necessity, and indicating her agreement.' This treatise was one of many similar efforts to find a more reliable criterion for conduct than that afforded by the traditional dogma or belief: such a criterion could be found in the relatively simple principles of utility and necessity. According to Bray, it is useless to set up a moral code on the basis of the inherent good or bad qualities of characters and actions. It is beside the point also, once an ill act has been committed, to be concerned with the "guilt" or "innocence" of a supposed offender, with his good or bad motives, his ignorance, or other extenuating 'J.

Instead, attention must always be focussed in ad- vance on the consequences of actions. Good actions are those which produce favorable consequences for oneself and for society at large; evil actions are those which happen to be less well adapted to human progress, and which, by a benevolent arrangement of nature, the perpetrators are warned not to repeat by the pains which inevitably follow these actions. In a physical and moral world governed by unalterable law, consequences must if possible be carefully weighed before acting. Often an evil outcome seems inevitable, and nothing can alter the deed once done, or obliterate its consequences. But this is not fatalism: even error and crime bring good in the end, since at the least others can learn and profit from the experiences of the unfortunate, and take measures to prevent the recurrence of a similar calamity.2 This line of thought, for which Bray was indebted to Bentham and other utilitarians, runs conspicuously through Adam Bede. In this novel those who fail to forejudge the consequences of their deeds pay dearly for their error. Addlepated Hetty has a "vision of consequences at no time more than a narrow fantastic calcula- tion of her own probable pleasures and pains" (XXXI); she is very limited but is not spared on account of her helplessness. Her tribu- lations provide an object-lesson for the others. Also there is Arthur Donnithorne, whose reputation and planned career are in the end darkened by his irresponsible failure to foresee in time the results likely to follow upon his lighthearted midsummer escapade. Donnithorne's case shows how inadequate is the popular idea of what constitutes virtue in a young man. He was amiable, well disposed to everyone, enormously popular among his entire ac- quaintance. He thrived on this general adulation, and was full of benevolent plans for the welfare of his grandfather's tenantry when that stingy and hardened old gentleman should cease to encumber the scene. Everyone, and not least himself, thought it impossible that so wellborn and personable a young man could ever do any- 2 Charles Bray, The Philosophy of Necessity (London, I841), I, 176-177, I96-i97, 204-206.</page><page sequence="4">"Adam Bede" 137 thing dastardly or cruel. But the criteria which society applies in judging character are soon revealed to be very superficial. When Arthur let himself slip momentarily into a wrong-doing he had not really intended "there was a sort of implicit confidence in him that he was really such a good fellow at bottom, Providence would not treat him harshly." Here the author rejoins that it is a "pity that consequences are determined not by excuses but by actions!" (XXIX). Arthur's lapse was partly owing to society's failure to indoctrinate him in adequate principles of conduct; yet he had been clearly warned beforehand by Mr. Irwine that "there are certain alterative doses which a man may administer to himself by keeping unpleasant consequences before his mind" (XVI). In other words all would have been well had Arthur heeded the Rector's advice: he was not bound by fate to play the fool, and as a rule one is free to choose the better course. After the wrong was committed Arthur found it was really impossible to make amends, eager as he was to do so. It was equally useless for Adam Bede to think of revenge, or for Mr. Irwine to reproach the offender; what's done is done. The guilt of the affair might be supposed to attach itself to Arthur rather than to Hetty; yet "you have no right to say that the guilt of her crime lies with him," Mr. Irwine told Adam. "It is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution" (XLI). It is of no use to blame anyone for the past, but for the future it must be remembered that "conse- quences are unpitying"-they are the certainty we must fix our minds upon regardless of other considerations-as the author re- iterates at every opportunity. This conclusion is borne home not only on Hetty and Donni- thorne, but on others as well. Even the Reverend Mr. Irwine was deficient in his estimate of consequences when he imagined that Arthur's vanity, his love of popularity, would be a sufficient safe- guard against folly (XVI); and after his father's death Adam Bede had to repent his now irrevocable harshness to his drunken parent. Dinah Morris alone never failed to foresee the penalties for mis- taken courses: long before Hetty's "trouble" she sensed approach-</page><page sequence="5">138 Nineteenth-Century Fiction ing dangers. She tried to protect Hetty, but Hetty rejected her (XV). Worked in with this utilitarianism is George Eliot's favorite theme of altruism, to which Bray, and later Comte, contributed. Bray, who was a hot phrenologist, thought that seated in a particular organ of the brain was a powerful instinct of benevo- lence, which would assist man in choosing the line of conduct most favorable to the general good.3 There are three altruists in Adam Bede: Parson Irwine, Dinah Morris, and finally Adam himself. Adam was relatively harsh and unsympathetic at the be- ginning; but schooled through adversity and the influence of Dinah he became her partner in marriage and good works at the conclusion. These characters who are guided by the feeling of altruism are contrasted to Hetty and Donnithorne, whose domi- nant passions are the inferior ones of pride and vanity. George Eliot made her points chiefly through the relationships of Hetty, Arthur, and Adam, with Mr. Irwine often acting as her spokesman. It is doubtful whether the other chief character, Dinah Morris, pulls her weight in the story. Despite her Methodist ser- monizing and garb, she is a vague, disembodied presence rather than a real person:' she is Feuerbach's principle of humanitarian love. George Eliot agreed with Feuerbach (whose Essence of Christianity she had translated in I854) that the love of man for man should in this age transform and replace man's former un- fruitful love for a remote anthropomorphic deity. True, Dinah preaches and talks like an orthodox Methodist, and performs her duty faithfully in the prison with Hetty, but the somewhat har- rowing sequence of Hetty's confession and repentance must be intended merely as a demonstration of the powerful effect of human sympathy-of "the love that had found its way to the dark prison cell and to poor Hetty's darker soul" (LV). This is apparent since, in the author's view, repentance would neither avail Hetty 3Bray, I, 262, 291-292. 4 In one passage Dinah is described as "almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love" (XV).</page><page sequence="6">"Adam Bede" 139 in the non-existent next world, nor enable her to escape earthly retribution for her act. The marriage of Dinah and Adam is painstakingly prepared for in the final chapters, but is not altogether a convincing de- nouement. It was Lewes who insisted that Dinah be given a more prominent part in the tale and that she become the bride of Adam." She gives up preaching except for "talking to the people a bit in their houses." Her decision to marry Adam and to devote herself henceforward mainly to household duties reflects the author's atti- tude that the best sphere for altrusim is to be found in the home and the vicissitudes of everyday life. This marriage also serves to moderate the impression given by the gloomy "consequences" theme, though we are never allowed to forget this last. In the "Epilogue" Hetty is dead and the others have learned their lesson. Arthur, "that poor young man" as Dinah always refers to him, is seven years later still trying to live down his wrong to Hetty. This lasting remorse does credit to Arthur's awakened moral sensibility; one feels, however, that so active a conscience must have been indeed rare among the young squires and soldiers of Arthur's day. Adam and his friends are now more aware of the tragic possibilities of life. Almost the final sentence of the book is "There's a sort of wrong that can never be made up for." Attempting to sugar the pill, George Eliot cleverly spaced her didactic passages, some of which ran to considerable length, among pleasing pictures of country life and characters. She escaped any suspicion of unorthodoxy by translating her argument into terms familiar to her church or chapel-going readers. At bottom, however, she was a rationalist, much less self-confident and more pessimistic than her friends Bray and Spencer, but like them anxious to make traditional beliefs and sentiments serve the ends of a modern humanitarian ethic. Seen in this light the carefully argued Adam Bede is poles apart from the sentimental novels in the Victorian circulating libraries. 6 Cross, II, 55.</page></plain_text>
