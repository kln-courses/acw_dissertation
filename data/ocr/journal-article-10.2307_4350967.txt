ISBN 91-554- 2367-1. Alroth surveys two unrelated aspects of figural dedications in sanctu- aries: 1) the influence of the cult image on figurine design, and 2) the quantity and variety of figurines of one deity dedicated at another's sanctuary, a phenomenon called "visiting gods". Both surveys are straightforward and well-organized, with sensible discussion and little speculation. In the first section, Alroth treats 17 sanctuaries, from those with the most reliably visualised cult images (Dreros, Paros) to those with little or no evidence for such images (Chios, Lousoi). She sets out what evidence there is for the cult statue(s) (relying almost entirely on 1. Romano's dissertation), then presents the range of figurines in chronological and iconographical order. Alroth's dependence on published material reduces this section's usefulness. For example, Dreros, the sanctuary with the best preserved (and earliest) cult images, has practically no published figurines with which to compare them. The most convincing congruities occur at Samos, Tiryns and Ephesus. The overall, unsurprising, conclusion is that influence may be detected sometimes, but not often. In the second section Alroth surveys 20 sanctuaries, representing eight deities. The tutelary deity is identified, and other figurines listed. Alroth provides reasonable criteria for her identifications, and looks hard for significant patterns, but methodological problems abound. Some figurines defy secure identification, many cannot be accurately dated, and in sanctuaries</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 511 with more than one deity (e.g. Olympia), it is not always clear to whom a figurine has been dedicated. Moreover, evidence is meager. Distinctions might derive from which deity is being considered, or simply which sex (Alroth feels goddesses received more visitors than gods, but this is barely indicated). Certain visitors may be considered more appropriate than others. Chronology is another variable. Permutations are so numerous that nothing of significance is said. This is a convenient survey, useful to archaeologists concerned with sanctuaries or figurine iconography. The absence of any larger discussion reduces its value for others. Champaign, IL ANDREA M.
