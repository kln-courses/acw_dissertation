Recent investigations have shown that nuclear magnetic reso- nance (NMR) can be used in conjunction with a suitable chemi- cal dosimeter to estimate the dose from ionizing radiation (Gore et al., Phys Med. Biol. 29, 1189-1197, 1984). Based on this fact it was proposed that spatial dose distributions can be measured in gels infused with the chemical dosimeter using NMR imaging. There have been few such attempts and they provided only qualitative results. In this paper, we report results demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining quantitative dose dis- tribution measurements by this technique. It is shown that quantitative dose distribution measurements necessitate the cal- culation of relaxation rate maps. We have determined that the spin-spin relaxation rate is a more sensitive parameter than the spin-lattice relaxation rate. It is also demonstrated that the ad- dition of chemical sensitizers could improve the dose sensitivity of the measured NMR parameters. The two features character- izing a photon beam, depth-dose relationship, and beam profile as measured by this technique are in good agreement with the measurements using conventional methods, ionization chambers, and film dosimetry. ? 1991 Academic Press, Inc. INTRODUCTION It is well known that ionizing radiation can induce cer- tain changes (like oxidation or reduction) in certain chemi- cal species. It is also well established that measurable nu- clear magnetic resonance (NMR)2 parameters (like the re- laxation rates) are very sensitive to certain chemical environmental changes (like the presence or absence of paramagnetic substances). Based on these two rather fun- damental facts, Gore et al. proposed the possibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure radiation dose distributions (1). Chemical dosimetry has been well studied over the past several decades. The Fricke dosimeter is one of the most commonly used dosimeters (2). The method is based on the fact that ferrous ions are oxidized to ferric ions upon irradiation. By measuring the concentration of ferric ions before and after irradiation one can then estimate the radia- tion dose received by the Fricke solution. Conventional methods for measuring the concentration of ferric ions use the spectrophotometer. Since ferrous and ferric ions are paramagnetic they both affect the proton (NMR) relax- ation rates but with significantly different efficacies. Based on this fact one can monitor the change in the concentra- tion of ferric ions in the Fricke solution using NMR. This was demonstrated by Gore et al. (1), who also proposed that, by infusing the Fricke solution into a gel medium, one should be able to map spatial dose distributions using MRI. There are few reports describing attempts to measure dose distributions using this technique 3 (3-8). Different types of gels, including gelatin (3, 6), agarose3 (5-7), Sephadex-200 (4), and polyacrylamide ( 7), have been used as tissue-equi- valent (or substitute) media. Some of these studies (4, 5, 8) included images demonstrating the qualitative value of the technique. In this paper, we report the possible use of MRI to mea- sure quantitatively the depth-dose distributions in gelatin gels infused with Fricke dosimeter solution. METHOD We chose to work with gelatin as the gel medium because it is simple to prepare. Ferrous sulfate solution and the gel (3% gelatin by weight) sam- ples were prepared by the method suggested by Olsson et al. (6). All the irradiations were done on a 6-MV Varian linear accelerator (Varian Asso- ciates, Palo Alto, CA) and the NMR measurements were carried out on a 1.5 T GE Signa system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). We used a Beckman U-V / Visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Fuller- ton, CA) for measurements of optical density (OD).

(1), we first esti- mated the relative enhancement in the proton relaxation rates in the pres- ence of ferric (Fe3") ions compared to ferrous (Fe2+) ions. Starting from the equations of Solomon (9) and Bloembergen and Morgan (10) we could show, 1 [ 3t 7t s(s 1)2 + W + 2tc RlFe3+ -rI 1 + 1t 2S Fea) 1 3t 13t R2 Fe+ s(s+ 1) [4tc. 1 + + 61 + 3t W~+ 1 (2 R2 se2+ (s+ 1) - 4tc + 3t22 1+23t +6 [C 1 + wt+ ] Fe2+ where R, (= 1 / T,) and R2 (= 1 / T2) are the spin-lattice and the spin-spin relaxation rates, respectively, s is the electron spin quantum number of the respective ions, r is the ion-nucleus distance, tc is the correlation time for dipolar interactions, and wo and w, are the Larmor frequencies for the proton and the electron, respectively. Substituting the following values for the various parameters at 1.5 T, wi = 63.84 MHz WS = 658.21 x wI t IF,3 = 5.1 x 10-"s (Ref. [11]) tClF,+ = 1.5 X 10-12S (Ref. [11]) SIFe3+ = SIFe2+ = 2, we obtain, R, Ie3+ 1 \r62+ 6 - 16.6 + 16.6 (2.a) RI Fe2+ r\ Fe3+ R2Fe3 25.5 rFe2+ )6 25.5 (2.b) R2 Fe2+ rFe3+ where we assumed rFe2+ rFe3+. We define these two ratios as the relative enhancement ratio for T, and T2 relaxation rates. To verify these expressions experimentally we mea- sured both T, and T2 of solutions containing different concentrations of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. In these experiments ping-pong balls were used to hold the dosimetric solutions. We measured the relaxation times in the spectro- scopic mode; i.e., no imaging gradients were applied. The T, was measured using an inversion recovery (IR) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 5 s. We recorded the integrated signal intensity values for different inversion times (TI) which were then fitted to Eq. ( 17) to estimate the T, relaxation rate. For the measurement of T2 we used a spin-echo (SE) sequence. The logs of the intensity values were plotted as a straight-line function of the different echo times (TE) using a least-squares fit. The slope of the fitted line corresponds to the T2 relaxation rate. Once the relationship between relaxation rate and concentration was established, one could calculate the sensitivity of the relaxation rate to radiation dose using the following equa- tion. aj = (3RjIFe3+ - 6Rj Fe2+) AM, (3) where 6R1 I Fe+ and 6RJ I F2+ are the changes in the relaxation rates in the presence of unit concentrations of Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions, respectively, and AR1 is the net change in the relaxation rate due to AM, the change in the concentration of Fe3+ ions upon irradiation which can be estimated using DGp 9.64 x 109 (4) where D is the absorbed dose (Gy), p is the density (kg m-3), G is the yield of Fe"3 ions per 100 eV of absorbed energy, and AMis the resultant change in the Fe3+ ion concentration (moles per liter) (2). After verifying the theoretical relationships described by Eqs. (2) and (3), we attempted to measure depth-dose distributions in a gel-containing Fricke dosimeter. In Fig. 3 we illustrate the simple setup used to measure depth-dose distributions. A plastic bottle (dimensions as shown in Fig. 3) filled with 3% gelatin infused with Fricke solution was irradiated with 6-MV X rays from a linear accelerator. The field size used was 4 x 4 cm2 at the surface and the source-to-surface distance was 100 cm. After an expo- sure of 5 Gy at a depth of 1.5 cm, an IR sequence with a TI of 0.4 s and a TR of 3 s was used to obtain an image of a coronal slice along the central axis of the bottle. The yield factor G for ferric ions is about 15.6 for the range of photon energies utilized in the current investigation (2). This results in a mini- mum detectable dose of about 1 Gy (see Appendix A). Several attempts have been made to improve the yield factor by the addition of certain organic compounds (12-14). Owing to the simplicity of its dose response we chose to use benzoic acid. The oxidation of ferrous ions in the presence of organic substances (AH2) and oxygen, although not precisely understood, is thought to in- volve the following reactions (15). Interaction of incident radiation with water results in the creation of free radicals and molecular products: H20 - H ., ? OH, H2, H20. (5) If the concentration of organic substance to that of ferrous ions is high enough, all * OH radicals react according to *OH + AH2 oAH * + H20.

(12) To verify experimentally the enhancement of dose sensitivity in the presence of benzoic acid, we exposed the dosimeter solution contained in small plastic vials (' 7 ml) while immersed in water. Both spectrophoto- metric and NMR measurements were performed to estimate the yield of ferric ions. Projection MR images (i.e., with no slice selection gradient applied) were obtained using the SE sequence with different TE and TR values. The actual parameters used were the same as the ones shown in the legend to Fig. 8. Individual relaxation rates were measured from the calcu- lated relaxation rate maps using regions of interest (ROI) including at least 100 pixels. The bottle experiment was repeated, but this time the Fricke solution contained about 1.32 mM benzoic acid in the place of 1 mM sodium</page><page sequence="3">RADIATION DOSIMETRY USING MRI 3 chloride (which is usually added to minimize effects due to organic impur- ities). The dose delivered was 20 Gy at the depth of maximum dose and data were obtained to allow calculation of T, and T2 relaxation maps. The relaxation rate maps in this study were calculated by the methods described below. Using the following expression for signal intensity from a saturation recovery SE sequence, we generated a look-up table of the ratio of signal intensities obtained with two different TR's for T, values within the range of 0 to 3 s: I= Ioexp(7T2) T2 x 1 - 2 exp T2 +exp TR . (13) The images obtained with the same set of TR's as above were then pro- cessed by computing the ratio of the signal intensities on a pixel-by-pixel basis and using that value to determine the T, relaxation rate from the look-up table. Spin-spin relaxation rate maps were obtained by processing sets of two images obtained with different TE values on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the following equation, 1 In I, - In I2 T2 TE2 - TE (14) In addition we used the noise reduction algorithm discussed in Ref. (16) to improve signal-to-noise ratio. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 1 shows the data derived experimentally that de- scribe the relationship between the relaxation rate and the concentration of ferrous and ferric ions. Fitting these data points with straight lines, we observe the relative enhance- ment ratio (as defined in the previous section) for T, and T2 relaxation rates to be 17.8 and 25.5, respectively. These values were obtained from the ratios of the slopes of the fitted lines as shown below.

The slopes of these plots are a little greater than the expected sensitivity values given above, possibly because the actual value of G is greater than 15.6. Figure 4 shows a T,-weighted MR image obtained with the bottle setup shown in Fig. 3 after exposure to a dose of about 5 Gy at a depth of 1.5 cm. The TI value was chosen to be approximately the null point for the unexposed portion of the gel. Since the T, values at the exposed regions would be shortened, the brightness in the image then corresponds to the dose. Although it is easily seen that the T,-weighted image clearly distinguishes the exposed region from the un- exposed one (similar to results in Refs. (4, 5)), there is no obvious information regarding the depth-dose variation. To illustrate the depth-dose variations, at least qualita- tively, we have modified the gray levels by generating equi- gray level bands with 5% increments. The result is shown in Fig. 5a.

Note the qualitative agreement in the shape of the "isodose contours" seen in Figs. 5a and 5b. One should also be aware that image intensity is very sensitive to several system-related parameters such as inhomogeneity in the transmit field and receiver response. Figure 6a describes the measured depth-dose variation. It shows the normalized T,-weighted intensity (expressed as a percentage) plotted as a function of depth. For the purpose of comparison, we have included the data from our routine depth-dose measurement using an ionization chamber on the linear accelerator used in this study. Figure 6b shows the relationship between the measurements made using MRI and the ionization chamber. The nonlinearity can be explained as follows. From our previous results we know that the relaxation rates are linearly related to the absorbed dose. Thus 1 1 1 - ocD = -= aD + (16) T, T, where 7I1 is the T, value of the unexposed regions. In an MR image obtained with an inversion recovery sequence, the measured T,-weighted intensity is given by I oexp ( - T E T I Ioexp I - 2 exp T T2 TI) + exp TR (17) Since the TR used was about five times the maximum T, value within the field of view (FOV), viz., T1, we can rewrite the above equation as I1oexpI - 2 exp -TIa D-TI TE = Io exp - 2[1 - 2c exp(-XD)], (18) where X = aTI and c = exp(-TI/Tr.) From Eq. (18) we observe that the T,-weighted intensity varies exponentially with dose. The exponential term in Eq. (18) can be ex- panded as Side view Bottom view 10 em . . . . cm X rays FIG. 3.

MR image of the central slice (along the axial plane) of the bottle filled with gel infused with Fricke dosimeter obtained after exposing to about 5 Gy of X radiation. It was acquired with an inversion recovery sequence using the following imaging parameters: TI = 0.4 s, TE = 0.02 s, TR = 3.0 s, 256 x 128 matrix size, two signal averages, and 1-cm slice thickness. The arrow indicates the direction of the radiation beam. 1 - 2c exp(- XD) = 1--2 -D+ (XD)2 (XD)3 + ] (19) =-2! 3! (19) a in our case is at least 0.02 s-' Gy-' and TI was 0.4 s. Hence for XD 0.1, i.e., D &lt;, 12.5 Gy, the higher-order terms can be neglected and thus the measured signal inten- sity I varies linearly with D. But at higher doses more terms in the expansion have to be included since XD &lt; 0.1 no longer holds. The maximum D in our case is only 5 Gy. The presence of nonlinearity thus suggests that the actual value of a and in turn the G value should be higher. It has been shown that the G value is enhanced in the presence of gela- tin by about a factor of 2 or more (6). Thus we conclude that one has to obtain relaxation rate maps to measure dose distributions without ambiguity. Figure 7 shows the enhancement of the dose sensitivity of the Fricke dosimeter due to the presence of benzoic acid (about 1.32 mM). Figure 7a shows the spectrophotometric measurements. The MR relaxation rate measurements are shown in Figs. 7b and 7c. The ratio of the slopes of the plots in Fig. 7a indicates the factor of improvement in sensitivity due to the addition of benzoic acid to be about 4.8. Al- though measurements of T2 relaxation rate show similar enhancement (^-4.5), the measurements of T, relaxation rate yield a much smaller factor ( 2.5). To demonstrate the three-dimensional capability of this technique, the experiment with the bottle phantom con- taining gel was repeated, but this time the Fricke solution contained about 1.32 mM of benzoic acid in the place of 1 mM sodium chloride. Figure 8 shows the images obtained with MR in all three planes (coronal, axial, and sagittal) after exposure to about 20 Gy at the depth of maximum dose. All the images were obtained with the spin-echo se- quence using different TR and TE values as given in the legend to Fig. 8. To investigate the depth-dose variation, separate images of a slice through the central axis in the coronal plane were obtained from which 1 / T and I/ T2 maps were calculated. The calculated relaxation rate maps are shown in Fig. 9. Figure 10 illustrates the measured depth variation of both the relaxation rates along with the depth-dose curve measured using the ionization chamber. The agreement between the curves in Figs. 10a and 10b is rather impressive (at least for depths up to 15 cm). Figure 11 shows the beam profiles obtained at different depths from the relaxation rate maps in Fig. 9. Profiles obtained with film dosimetry (carried out separately) are also in- cluded for purposes of comparison and validation. In analyzing the data obtained in Figs. 8 and 9, we did not translate the relaxation rate measurements to dose measure- ments. This was mainly because of the irreproducible na- ture of the G value in the presence of gelatin (or in general any impurities). In obtaining the plots shown in Figs. 10 and Il, we normalized the data with respect to the maxi- mum relaxation rate along the central axis. The percentage (or relative) depth-dose distributions can be translated into absolute depth-dose distributions by measuring absolute dose at just one point within the exposed region. This mea- surement could be achieved easily by incorporating a con- ventional dosimeter within the phantom. We feel that this method would be a simpler one and may provide better accuracy than trying to develop a gel system with a constant G value. Here we also wish to mention the presence of sys- tematic spatial variations (within FOV) in the measured relaxation parameters as shown by Breger et al. (17) and Masterson et al. (18). In addition to such system-related problems, spatial inhomogeneities within the gel could also become a potential practical hurdle in obtaining faithful dose-distribution measurements. In this study we did as- sume the absence of any such spatial variations. Thus in processing the images shown in Fig. 9 to obtain plots in Figs. 10 and 11, we have used the ROI values obtained from</page><page sequence="6">6 PRASAD, NALCIOGLU, AND RABBANI 6 a b ** - 43 -U FIG. 5.

Note the qualitative agreement in the shape of the "isodose contours" in (a) and (b). the unexposed region to estimate 1 / 1T and subtracted that value from each pixel. This ensured a linear dose response with zero offset. But even if spatial variations are present, one could circumvent the limitation in the following fash- ion. Since the interest is in obtaining changes in the relax- ation rates due to radiation dose, one can obtain data before exposing the gel to ionizing radiation and use it as a mask when processing the data obtained after the exposure. But such a masking approach will be successful only when the temporal systematic variations are absent or relatively small compared to inherent signal variations (noise). To study the systematic variations in T, measurements over a period realistically representing the duration of our experi- ments (about 3 h), we performed an experiment discussed in Appendix B. From this we conclude that the uncertainty in the mean T, measurement due to short-term systematic temporal variation is less than the uncertainty due to the noise in the data. Thus we feel the proposed masking tech- nique to correct for spatial variations in the system response and due to the inhomogeneities in the gel medium will be successful. CONCLUSIONS The following are the significant conclusions drawn from this study: ( 1) MRI can possibly be used to measure radiation dose distributions in a tissue-equivalent medium. (2) T,-weighted images (as also shown by other authors (4, 5, 9)) do illustrate dose distributions but only qualita- tively. To obtain quantitative measurements without ambi- guity, it is necessary to calculate T, or T2 relaxation rate maps. (3) Spin-spin relaxation rate is a more sensitive parame- ter than spin-lattice relaxation rate. It has been shown both theoretically and experimentally that 1/T2 measurement has a higher relative enhancement ratio. Calculation of 1 / T2 maps offers additional advantages including the utiliza- tion of a noise reduction algorithm, discussed in Ref. (16), for improving the SNR. (4) The addition ofbenzoic acid improves the dose sensi- tivity of the measured NMR relaxation parameters signifi- cantly.</page><page sequence="7">RADIATION DOSIMETRY USING MRI 7 S 120 60 . 40 20 O 5 10 15 20 depth (cm) 120 . l oo * " . ....

For an ideal 1:1 correspondence we would expect a straight line at 45 ". The last two points are important for a minimum measur- able dose and dose resolution considerations (see Appen- dix A). The advantages of this technique, as indicated by our results, include (1) obtaining dose distributions in three dimensions with just a single exposure and (2) the ability to measure dose distributions with high spatial resolution. The resolution achievable is dependent only on the NMR imaging technique used to "read" the dose distributions. The voxel size in the present study was about 0.9 x 0.9 x 5.0 mm3. Using three-dimensional acquisition tech- niques it is possible to reduce the slice thickness much fur- ther without compromising SNR. Also the inaccuracies in the relaxation rate measurements due to slice profile effects can be avoided with the use of three-dimensional tech- niques. With these advantages one could possibly use this tech- nique to (1) obtain dose distributions with particulate beams and brachytherapy sources where large spatial dose gradients are present and (2) obtain dose distributions in the presence of inhomogeneities. In this regard it should be possible to build anthropomorphic phantoms to study dose distributions in more realistic situations. Overall the results reported here, although preliminary in nature, are certainly encouraging to motivate further inves- tigations.

The arrows point in the direction of the radiation beam. 10 h, it is necessary to estimate the diffusion coefficient of the ferric ions in the gel medium used (which may then allow us to make some theoretical estimates). APPENDIX A Minimum Detectable Dose and Resolution in Dose Measurement We could define contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the relaxation rate map as AR AR CNRR - - , (A.1) O'AR -2UR where AR is the difference in the mean relaxation rates in the two regions of interest and 0a is the variance in the difference measurement. If we assume true random noise it would be a constant over the whole image and thus aR = ~IR. Since measured change in relaxation rate dose sensitivity AR dosesensitivity (A.2) dose sensitivity ' where AD is the dose received, AD dose sensitivity CNRR = -. (A.3) VaR A liberal definition for dose resolution would be the dose difference (AD) that leads to a CNRR of 1. Thus V~aR dose resolution - ADI CNRR=1 dose sensitivity (A.4) Since ax is a constant (independent of dose sensitivity), the dose resolution is inversely proportional to the dose sensi- tivity. SNRR could be defined as a special case of the CNRR as follows: D dose sensitivity SNRR - CNRR IAD=D = 2a (A.5) We could now define minimum detectable dose as that dose (D) that would result in an SNRR of 1.</page><page sequence="10">10 PRASAD, NALCIOGLU, AND RABBANI 120 -4 100 80 60 40 20 a 20 0 5 10 15 20 depth (cm) 120 N 100 80 40 0 " 20 b 0 5 10 15 20 depth (cm) FIG. 10.

Minimum detectable dose D SNRR= dose sensitivity dose sensitivity (A.6) From Eqs. (A.4) and (A.6), we see that the minimum de- tectable dose and the dose resolution are numerically equal. This is intuitively correct, but for practical considerations there is a subtle difference between these quantities which is of considerable significance. If we use a Fricke solution with no chemical sensitizer (i.e., dose sensitivity = 0.015 s-' Gy-'), both minimum detectable dose and the dose resolution are - 1 Gy (using r/T, '~ 0.01 s-' from the image shown in Fig. 9). Here it is necessary to emphasize that the minimum dose detectable using a spectrophotometer is only slightly less than this amount. To be useful in radiation therapy treatment plan- ning one should be able to measure doses in the range of 0-4 Gy with a dose resolution of at least 0.2 Gy. Owing to the above limitations, one needs to scale the dose higher up in a suitable fashion so as to achieve the desired accuracy. This can be accomplished easily (since we irradiate only the phantoms) by using the following empirical relationship. dosedeivered = min. detectable dose resolutioninherent + reltnn max. dosedesired. resolutiondird Substituting some realistic values, 1 Gy dosedelivered = 1 Gy + 4 Gy = 21 Gy. (A.8) 0.2 Gy While the minimum detectable dose is only an additive offset, dose resolution is a multiplicative factor. So even though numerically the quantities are equal, their relative significance in practice is markedly different. For example, to be able to detect a dose of 0.2 Gy, we have to deliver only 1.2 Gy, but if we need a dose resolution of 0.2 Gy in the range of 0-1 Gy, we have to deliver (1 + 5) = 6 Gy. This simple example shows the motivation to search for ways to improve the CNR (or SNR). The improvement can be achieved by either increasing the dose sensitivity or decreasing the noise in the measurement or ideally both. While chemical sensitizers like benzoic acid help increase the dose sensitivity, optimized imaging techniques along with the use of proper image processing would help to mini- mize the noise. The imaging parameters we have used in this study are not quite optimized (at least not for the T2 measurement), but we did employ image processing in cal- culating the relaxation rate maps shown in Fig. 9. For the calculation of the 1 / T, map we used simple local averag- ing, while the 1 / T2 map was calculated using a noise reduc- tion algorithm (16). This algorithm has been shown to pre- serve the mean value and high frequency details while signif- icantly improving the SNR. APPENDIX B An Investigation of the Systematic Variations in T, Measurements Relaxation rate measurements using MRI have been shown to be prone to both spatial and temporal systematic variations (17, 18). The success of the masking method proposed in this work to correct for spatial variations in the system response will depend on the assumption that the systematic temporal variations are absent or relatively small compared to the inherent signal variations (noise). We use the term "systematic temporal variation" to repre- sent the variation in the mean value in the measurements carried out at different times. To study the systematic varia- tions (both spatial and temporal) over a period realistically representing the durations of our experiments, we per- formed the following experiment. We used a large bottle (--20 cm diameter and 30 cm long) of water doped with copper sulfate as a phantom.

This is because doped water is a well-mixed sample devoid of any inherent spatial inhomogeneities. We obtained 10 pairs of spin-echo images (with TR = 0.4 and 3.0 s) in succession over a pe- riod of 3 h and then calculated the T, maps using the algo- rithm discussed in this paper. Figure 12 shows one typical T, map along with the ROI (composed of --749 pixels) positions used in the following analysis. j M K ...... ....... .

Notice in all cases .mean &lt; anoise tion. We do see significant spatial variation in the measured T1 value. Figure 14 relates the ensemble mean and standard deviation in the mean T, value over the 10 measurements (amean) to the mean and standard deviation in the individ- ual ROI measurements (noise) from one representative T, map, in this case the T, map No. 5. Notice that the ensem- ble mean T, value and the mean from one individual T1 map fall on a straight line with a slope - 1.0 and zero offset. Even though Fig. 14 shows the results only for the ROI's from the T, map No. 5 (out of a total of 10), we have observed that the same behavior is valid for all other T, maps. This means that the T, measurements from any one of the 10 individual measurements are a true representation of the ensemble mean T, value. The standard deviation in an individual ROI measurement contains contributions from both random uncorrelated white noise and systematic errors which manifest themselves as correlated noise (19). While the noise variance due to white noise can be reduced by increasing the number of signal averages (NVA's), as discussed in Ref. (19), the presence of systematic errors limit such improvement in SNR beyond a certain NAV value. The same work reports a realistic estimate of 121 for NAV beyond which the TNAV improvement in SNR is not achieved. Although this number will depend on individual systems, we wish to emphasize that the number is at least an order of magnitude greater than what is used in practice (at least in MRI). Thus, in a realistic practical MR imaging situation, we have significant uncertainties present due to both random white noise and systematic errors. This is ap- parent in the results presented in Fig. 14 (horizontal error bars). Also note that Omean &lt; anoise. This implies that the limiting uncertainty in the measurement is due to the errors in the individual measurement rather than to the short- term (over a few hours which is representative of our exper- iments) temporal variations in the system response. Here we would like to point out that in Refs. (17) and (18) the authors provide data for temporal variations in the mea- sured relaxation rates but do not compare those variations with the inherent uncertainties in each of their measure- ments. From the results presented above we conclude that the masking technique we have proposed would be successful in practice. One should of course be aware that the a in the mask-subtracted image will be greater than the a in each, i.e., the mask and the image itself. If we assume that both the mask and the image have the same standard deviation, viz., Omask, then the processed image would have a standard deviation equal to Vi2mask. One could improve this by per- forming more number of signal averages.
