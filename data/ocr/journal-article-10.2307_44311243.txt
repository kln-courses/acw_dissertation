<plain_text><page sequence="1">75 ESSAY Michel Foucault and The Study of Literature and Theology By David J. Leigh, S.J., Gonzaga University The role of Michel Foucault in literary criticism is still enigmatic. Despite his central position in French thought, with a dozen books published between 1 960 and 1980, he elicits only passing mention in a standard survey of the theology of literature (Vernon Ruland, Horizons of Criticism, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 197S). Cultural critics such as George Steiner or G.S. Rousseau have dismissed him as eccentric; historians have taken him to task for errors of fact; literary critics have only recently begun to borrow his categories for the purpose of re-interpreting problematic figures like William Blake.1 Foucault has managed to both engage and enrage philosophers and social scientists, provoking Piaget and Derrida to write incisive critiques and evoking two recent volumes of criticism from American philosophers and social scientists.2 In fact, most readers of Foucault have difficulty in situating what he is trying to do in a particular discipline. As Hayden White has said of his writing: "It looks like history, like philosophy, like criticism, but it stands over against these discourses as ironic antithesis. " 3 What might Foucault offer a student of theology and literature? Before one can answer this question, one must do what most critics have not been able to do - simply 4 'locate' ' him. I propose to do this by giving an overview of his life and works, then presenting his basic notions, and finally summarizing eight positive contributions the study of Foucault could provide to theological criticism. The life of Michel Foucault itself gives a clue to his conceptual slipperiness, for he has been a cultural vagabond in both his background and his fields of study. Born in 1926 at Poitier as the son of a Protestant surgeon, he attended both state and private schools before entering the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1945. He earned a License in philosophy in 1948 and one in psychology two years later. A leftist most of his youth, he quit the Communist party in 1951 but retained socialist sympathies. In 1952, he received a diploma in psychopathology and did research for three years in French hospitals. In 1956, he began a series of teaching jobs in Uppsala, Warsaw, and Hamburg, all the time pursuing the writing of a different sort of cultural history, which was published in 1960 as Madness and Civilization , the tour de force which won him a doctorate</page><page sequence="2">CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE 76 and a post at the University of Clermont. In the 1960's, he wrote two more provocative books in the history of medicine and the social sciences from his novel perspective of philosophical ' 'archeology* ' - The Birth of the Clinic (1963) and The Order of Things (1966). In 1969, he published a theoretical work on his methodology entitled The Archeology of Knowledge. After two more teaching jobs in Tunis and Vincennes, he was awarded a research professorship in 1970 at the College de France. Strongly influenced by the student uprisings of 1968, Foucault radically changed his approach in the 1970's from his earlier focus on discourse to a new focus on the role of power in influencing language and institutions. This new focus led to more politically influential opinions in his history of prisons, Discipline and Punish ( 197S) and his History of Sexuality, the first volume of which appeared in 1976. Since becoming an intellectual celebrity, he has published a number of essays and interviews from his Nietzschean standpoint in English editions entitled Language , Counter-Memory , Practice (1977) and Power/ Knowledge (1980). In the past decade, he has also lectured in the United States and begun a dialogue with American philosophers of language such as John Searle. Foucault has never written directly about literature and theology. In his writings of the 1960's, he included passing references to theological and literary works within the general category of ' 'discourse.' ' In his early attempts to find some sort of unity in the histories of "madness" and 1 'medicine, " he discovered it was much easier to set aside questions about historical truth and meaning. In place of truth and meaning, he tried to focus simply upon public expert language ("discourse") and public institutions, systems, or events ("practice"). He also sought to overcome the lack of unity he found in philosophy and the history of ideas. Thus, in The Order of Things, he concentrated on three areas of the social sciences - the areas of discursive practice which were to become economics, philology, and biology. Although he has shifted his position from time to time on the question of the mutual influence of discourse and practice, he retained his primary focus on the history of human discourse. Thus, if he discusses a theological work (as he does in his use of moral theology in his History of Sexuality), he treats it as a type of language used by experts to organize their fields of interest, thereby bracketing the questions of historical validity or even clarity of meaning. He takes literature very seriously as a cultural phenomenon but treats it as merely another form of discourse until it becomes quasi- autonomous around the time of the Romantics. In Foucault* s system, perhaps his most influential early notion was that of the episteme. The episteme is his name for the unifying pattern of discourse within a given period of history. An episteme exists neither on the level of observable facts or the so-called deeper level of concepts or systems. Rather, an episteme is "the total set of relations that unite, at a given period, the discursive practices that give rise to epistemological figures, sciences, and possibly formalized systems."4 Other names Foucault gave to the episteme were "archive" and "historical a priori," both of which distinguish its discontinuous historical nature from the continuous and universal cultural patterns of Lévi-Strauss and other</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL FOUCAULT structuralists. The episteme of a given period, for Foucault, was presumably present within the language patterns of all fields, including literature and theology, although his own study concentrated only on three social sciences. In these three fields, Foucault discovered three major historical epistemes in modern Europe: the Renaissance (ca. 1500-1 6S0), the Classical (ca. 1650-1800), and the Modern (ca. 1800-1950). The Renaissance pattern of discourse was based on resemblance. Foucault's description of the Renaissance ' 'universe folded in upon itself" recalls for literary students the more static world views of Tillyard's "Elizabethan World Picture" or Lovejoy's "Great Chain of Being," with the usual examples from Shakespeare, Spenser, or Milton. Foucault, however, emphasizes the privileged position given by the Renaisance to writing as such: " Knowing therefore consisted in relating one form of language to another form of language; in restoring the great, unbroken plain of words and things; in making everything speak."5 Until 1650, all learning was a form of interpreting, with science interpreting Nature, literature interpreting Man, and theology interpreting the Word of God. With the breakdown of this visible and imaginative similitude in the Renaissance episteme around 1650 emerged a new pattern of discourse, one which Foucault calls Classical and which focuses not on resemblance but on pure representation. This pattern of representation underpinned both rationalism and empiricism in philosophy, mechanism in science, and so-called neo- classicism in literature. In place of the traditional resemblance between words, ideas, and things, "classical" thinkers from Descartes to Samuel Johnson found they had to use artificial signs to build up an enumeration of all aspects of a field within a taxonomy or complete satisfaction. With signs no longer imaginatively connected by resemblance to the signified world, thinkers and poets constituted them as significant by their acts of knowing and creating. When a "classical" writer saw an object "clearly and distinctly," then he or she re-presented that object by a sign and placed it within the complete order of things. This method could provide Linnaeus a way to an accurate taxonomy of plants; or Alexander Pope, in his Essay on Man , a way to "expiate free o'er all this scene of man;/ A mighty maze! but not without a plan." In both science and poetry, neo-classical writers, Foucault seems to be saying, followed Samuel Johnson's norm for good literature: "just representations of general nature." When this classical episteme disappeared around 1800, what does Foucault find emerging? He calls the pattern underlying discourse from 1800 to 1950 the "modern" episteme. This pattern beneath the Romantics and Moderns in literature, the Kantian- Hegelian tradition in philosophy, and the rise of the social sciences, modern biology, and philology is difficult to summarize. In The Order of Things, Foucault stresses the organic historicity of this modern grid. As he sums up the movement beneath the rise of romanticism and social science: "Representation has lost the power to provide a foundation. . . . Things have now escaped from the face of the [taxonomie] table. . .they turn in upon themselves, posit their own volumes, and define for themselves an internal space."6 Writers, scientists, and philosophers after 1800 no longer struggled 77</page><page sequence="4">CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE 78 primarily to create adequate representation of the ways in which everything fits onto a universal map of reality; now they struggled to interrelate the parts within a flow of evolutionary history. Foucault finds this new movement toward inner organic unity and human historicity in the new sciences of Life, Labor and Language. For the student of English or American romanticism, this emphasis on organicism and historicity comes as no surprise. In both imagery and critical theory, 4 Organicism' ' is an important notion for Coleridge, Wordsworth, and critics of romanticism like Morse Peckham or M.H. Abrams. Likewise, historical consciousness has long been traced back to the Romantics, whether in the personal history of Wordsworth's Prelude or the imaginative histories of Carlyle. Foucault's description of the "modern" period and its underlying archive contains two further traits that are of crucial interest to a theology of literature. Modernity, for Foucault, brought with it the emergence of a separate and self- contained study of both man and literature. Before 1800, Foucault claims that the human and the literary were usually studied as part of a wider category - the human was studied as merely one level of being, and the literary, as one type of discourse. With the emergence of organic historicity came " self-conscious man" and " self-contained literature"; these were to become the subject matter of the new disciplines of psychology and literary criticism. The results of the new emphasis on the self-conscious subject can be traced in both the theological line from Schleiermacher and Kierkegaard and in the literary line from Coleridge and Wordsworth. In both fields arose what Foucault calls "a writing subjectivity." This emphasis on the subject and the subjective remains central to phenomenology, existentialism, and their counterparts of criticism. The correlative emphasis on self-contained literature, i.e. literature that focuses not on representing human reality but on the 4 'simple act of writing," can be seen in the rise of Symbolism, Modernism, and formalist criticism.7 Foucault links the emergence of self-conscious "man" and self-contained "literature" to a post-Kantian realization of "the analytic of finitude." This phrase describes the situation of nineteenth-century human sciences which studied the human person as self-aware subject and also as finite object of outside forces. As "enslaved sovereign" and "observed spectator," modern man emerges as a person trapped in several impossible tensions. This human "doublet" is caught between the drive for the infinite (which is now the endless process of history) and the bind of the finite (which is now starkly clear in the clinical sciences of death and the body). The human is also trapped philosophically by the tensions between the empirical and the transcendental, conscious of the limits of the self as subject and of the conditions of knowing any object. Furthermore, for Foucault, post-Kantian thinkers are in a bind because they are both inquiring consciousnesses and unconscious containers of irrational forces ("unthought"). Finally, the individual is now caught as a doublet between the "retreat and return" of his own origin, a phrase he uses to describe the endless struggle with time and historicity.8 These unresolved tensions align themselves with earlier forms of scepticism, but the tension may also appear in</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL FOUCAULT literary form in the notion of romantic irony, a concept first suggested by Schlegel and taken up by Byron in Don Juan. Surprisingly, we might note, this notion of romantic irony - with its stress on the tension between the infinite and the finite - first led Schlegel into a philosophical scepticism based on a belief in infinite chaos, but later led him into Christian faith. Foucault asserts that literary criticism of the modern period has struggled to find its place in the variety of sciences that have arisen out of the episteme of organic historicity. As one of the peripheral "human sciences' ' that emulate but do not equal the clarity of the physical sciences or philosophy, literary criticism tends to invade the realms of the major new sciences of Life, Labor, and Language. In competing with biology, economics, or philology, literary critics tend toward reductionism. Instances can be found in Freudian, Marxist, or myth criticism. As these attempts to rival the new social sciences fail, the critic of literature is forced to remain, in Foucaulťs words, "in that region where the laws and forms of language hold sway but where they remain on the edge of themselves, enabling man to introduce into them the play of his representations."9 Without a method of its own, literary criticism takes on models of analysis from other fields. Some have picked up the metaphors of organicism from biology; others have used the images of conflict and law from economics; still others have incorporated terms from philology like sign, signification, and semiotics. For Foucault, literary study - like psychology or sociology - remains insecure and derivative. Foucaulťs own forays into literary criticism are themselves provocative. He has studied major French and German writers of the early modern period such as Hölderlin, Sade, Flaubert, and Mallarmé, but his most famous studies have been of writers whose literary efforts have combined literature with philosophy and politics - Roussel, Artaud, Bataille, Blanchot, and, primarily, Nietzsche. 10 In his studies of the major writers of the emerging modern period, Foucault recognizes that literature often assumed the power that once was held by religion. For instance, he asserts that a continental romantic poet like Hölderlin "could only speak in the space marked by the disappearance of the gods and that language could only depend on its own power to keep death at a distance. ' ' 1 1 After the end of the classical Christian culture around 1800, the lost culture in which all human words of literature were subordinate to the Word of God, Foucault finds literature attempting to become autonomous, in a way similar to the "Natural Supernaturalism" M. H. Abrams has described in romanticism. In the transitional era in which literature relinquishes its role of representation and tries to replace religion, arise a series of authors who stretch language to extreme forms of the unspeakable. The master here, of course, is the Marquis de Sade; the pupil, Nietzsche. Surrounded by the absurdity of an unknowable origin and an incomprehensible death, the extreme "modern" writer for Foucault creates new genres - the horror story, the novel of infinite regress, the theater of cruelty - to capture the situation of self-conscious man as a precarious "doublet' ' caught in the abyss of the death of God leading to the death of Man. Beyond these quasi-philosophical studies of literature, of course, is the 79</page><page sequence="6">CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE 80 ultimate focus of Foucault's writings - "power /knowledge." By "power/ knowledge,' ' Foucault means the interdependencies between socio-political practices (institutions of medicine, psychiatry, prisons, marriage) and forms of knowledge (meanings of "sickness,' ' "madness," "crime," "sexuality"). Any powerful institution necessarily controls the very meaning of discourse used to discuss it, whether in a Marxist university, a capitalist corporation, a psychoanalytic clinic, or a neo-orthodox seminary. In fact, all of his works attempt to relate language to social forces. As fascinating as his studies of the history of medicine or insanity or the social sciences may be, they are always searching for the relationship between language and politics, between disclosure and power. In his writings after 1968, Foucault has given up his earlier epistemologica! terminology in favor of a series of political terms derived from Nietzsche (Will to Power, Power/Knowledge, geneology, etc.) In taking on new terms, however, he has not abandoned his lifelong distrust of traditional history of metaphysics. In fact, Foucault remains generally sceptical about both the kno wabili ty of the human subject and the objectivity of historical knowledge of causes, purposes, and continuity. History, while not merely a random series of events, exhibits a limited regularity of "transformations" in the midst of its general discontinuity. The study of these limited transforming events is called "geneology." Beneath these events - and beneath the old patterns of the epistemes, one would surmise - lies the "will to power." Foucault uses this Nietzschean term to refer to "the multiplicity of power relations" within each field of discourse. Thus, we find that his histories of crime and of sexuality provide an explicit but non-Marxist, political explanation of the language of punishment or sexuality. Foucault searches for the political and social forces (embodiments of the will to power) as they control the language (sighs of the will to knowledge) in these fields. For instance, he studies how even a repressive police state allows some language critical of authority to be mentioned within the limits of a party trial, or how church leaders permitted detailed discussion of sex within the confessional. After he has shown how the limits of language are controlled by social forces, he then seeks to show "how series of discourses are formed" despite these limits. What he has yet to clarify is the extent to which language itself reciprocally reacts and influences social and political forces. In all his books, Foucault insists that he is not to be classified as a member of the other predominant schools of French social and literary thought - Marxist, structuralist, or post-structuralist. Marxists overemphasize economic structures and downplay the roles of discourse. Structuralists overemphasize cultural patterns and downplay history and change. Derrida and the deconstructionists seem to Foucault to be "trifling" with a superficial, non-historical "reduction of discursive practice to textual traces."12 Yet, critics are still seeking to "place" Foucault within or without a particular "school." What value, then, might Foucault have for a study of theology and literature? His own literary criticism, as we have seen briefly, falls outside the usual categories given by literary theologians; Foucault would deny any reduction of his efforts to those of what Ruland calls formalist, humanist, ortho-cultural, or</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL FOUCAULT psycho-mythic critics. Foucault' s attempt to provide a universal method for understanding all human culture through his study of discourse and power challenges the Christian thinker to a dialogue that may prove more fruitful than Foucaulťs presuppositions would at first suggest. 1 will re-examine eight aspects of his writings that should provoke as well as enlighten the literary theologian. First, Foucaulťs notion of the episteme could prove helpful in explaining the periodization of major religious poetry from the Renaissance through the modern period. For instance, while Maynard Mack, M.H. Abrams, and others have shown some continuity in the development of the epic from Milton's Paradise Lost through Pope's Essay on May to Wordsworth's Prelude, Foucaulťs analysis of the episteme of the Renaissance, Neo-classical, and Romantic periods offers a more thorough and coherent explanation of the discursive pattens underlying these major works of three English historical periods. Foucaulťs notion of resemblance, for example, ties together Milton's complex use of classical, biblical, and scientific imagery and myth in Paradise Lose; the notion of representation explains how Pope could adapt a similar theme to a rationalistic age; and the notion of organic historicity underpins Wordsworth's transformation of the images and ideas of Milton's salvation myth and Pope's theodicy into the evolutionary development of his own personal history as "the growth of the poet's mind." A theological approach to these periods, however, might well take Foucaulťs notions to go beyond his principle of "discontinuous history." Just as Foucault himself seems to leave behind his early theory of rigidly separated epistemes when he finds precursors of later periods (e.g. Nietzsche as a modern harbinger of the post-modern), so too a literary historian might find in William Cowper, for example, an important transformational figure. For Cowper in The Task (1785) embodied material and style from both Paradise Lost and Essay on Man but shaped his own poem into a first-person narrative of a poet's growth through disillusionment to revelation, a pattern very close to that used by Wordsworth in his Prelude. Secondly, a Christian theology of literature might benefit from Foucaulťs re- emphasis on history in the face of various twentieth-century critical approaches that neglect it, in particular, New Criticism, structuralism, and deconstruction- ism. Foucault, in rejecting a rationalist history which seeks a total explanation of all events in terms of one-dimensional economic or political forces, opens up his "contextual" history to a possible religious dimension. What Foucault would call a "rupture" or a moment of unexplained "transformation" in his general history could be interpreted by a Christian historian as a moment of grace. 13 This openness to a "rupture" in history by the transcendent makes plausible a Christian interpretation of such traditional novelistic techniques as Dickens' use of coincidence or Dostoievsky's use of Christlike heroes in The Idiot or The Brothers Karamazov. In fact, such possibilities of interpretation are essential for a theologian of literature if one is to take seriously modern works such as Eliot's Four Quartets, C. S. Lewis' Space Trilogy, or the stories of Flannery O'Connor. Thirdly, Foucaulťs critique of the reduced version of "man" as constructed by social sciences in the modern period certainly is compatible with, and may 81</page><page sequence="8">CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE 82 even call for, a theological critique of the same version. When Foucault analyzes the decline of the modern image of man from the illusory 4 Enslaved sovereign'' of the romantics to the 4 'observed spectator" of late nineteenth century deterministic sciences, he provides a background for the history of the human person in the literature of the same period. From Goethe's Faust, Bryon's Manfred, or Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein to Hardy's Tess, Dreiser's Sister Carrie, or Zola's Nana, the descent from the romantic to the naturalistic image of the person is a subject for much dialogue between Foucault and literary theologians. Fourthly, we must remember that this descent of man was not always quite so simple for Foucault, as the literary parallels may suggest. In the process of being reduced after 1800 to a form of "organic historicity," the human person became, as we have seen, a "human doublet." The modern man of Foucault finds himself caught in impossible tensions which are simultaneously, for the Christian critic, analogous to theological dilemmas. The bind between infinite and finite, between subject and object, between origin and return - these are all, in Christian terms, modern versions of the paradox of the human condition. Just as modern theologians such as Barth, Tillich, and Rahner have struggled to make theological sense of the paradoxes of the post- Kantian period, so too twentieth- century Christian novelists have used paradox and irony as major modes of writing (e.g. Chesterton, Bernanos, Charles Williams, Graham Greene). What for Foucault constitutes the impossible contradictions of modern "man" becomes for Christian literary thinkers such as William Lynch, Nathan Scott, or Giles Gunn contemporary versions of biblical themes such as the mystery of sin and salvation or the paradox of the Incarnation. Emerging from this emphasis on paradox and irony in the modern period is a fifth theme from Foucault's works - the emphasis on the irrational, the "unthought," the Other. This motif, which has preoccupied the criticism of Nathan Scott, calls for further consideration by contemporary theological critics of literature. They can begin, as some have done, to use Foucault's critique of the modern age as a via negativa to free themselves from the idols of modern culture, especially those idols that seem closest to the nature of the person. David Tracy has described well this first step of liberation (speaking in the voice of modern searchers for God): "We will fashion, with Foucault and Deleuze, an antigenetic, antihistorical, antihumanistic Nietzschean geneological method which will break all codes. . .to cure our need for presence, for history, for reason itself.14 From this via negativa, the modern searchers, according to Tracy, could use the sense of emptiness and of the "uncanny" to discover the transcendent. But if one follows Foucault, the way to the transcendent will be a way not toward the Same but towards the Other. Foucault's emphasis on the 'irrational' Other, if freed from its Nietzschean overtones, might provide an indirect and oblique approach to God as the "totally other." In contrast to the anthropomorphic thinking of process theology, this way of Foucault could make use of very unlikely characters in literature as "prophets." For instance,</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL FOUCAULT such baffled strugglers as Dostoievsky's underground men, Kafka's "K," or Camus' stranger might become for a theological critic precursors of the uncanny. This use of unlikely prophets leads us to a sixth point. In Foucault' s pursuit of the Other in history, he searches through the discourses of writers who are often considered abnormal by society - Sade, Hölderin, Nietzsche, Artaud, Roussel. In their language of madness, sickness, or criminality, Foucault finds the vatic signatures of the elusive Other, a sort of counter-cultural "improper" discourse which reveals their resistance to the invisible forces of power and desire.1 5 Foucault 's interest in these underground literary forms might suggest the importance of "improper" modes in contemporary poetry, fiction, and drama. It seems no accident that Flannery O'Connor or William Pynchon employ grotesques to bring alive their religious visions, or that Saul Bellow or Walker Percy use parody and comedy to communicate with a secular public. Religious authors today must contrive to use all forms of discourse - "proper" and "improper" - to convey what seems inaccessible to readers with post-modern sensibilities.16 For Foucault - and this is a seventh point - not only has direct discourse been taken over by institutions of established power, but their very use of power in recent times has taken on what was once a religious function. In a late essay on the all-encompassing role of the State, Foucault describes the power of government as a very special form of "pastoral power." In secularizing religious authority, the modern State has taken to itself the pastoral powers to "save," to "serve," to govern society and the individual, and to direct consciences.17 What is new for Foucault in this pastoral technique is the apparent benevolence of the State in its exercise of total control and its fostering of a sort of atomic individualization within collectivity that makes resistance difficult. Whereas Foucault gives only political examples of this new form of power, one might suggest literary prophets of it in Kafka, Orwell, Solzhenitsyn, Anthony Burgess, and holocaust literature. In the same essay, Foucault also indicates his continuing interest in two aspects of human life that are crucial to a Christian theology of literature but which he previously found inaccessible to discourse in the modern era - freedom and the person. Now he tells us that his interest all along has not been so much in power as in the human subject, especially in the ways the person turns into a subject (of language, power, sexuality) or submits to become an object (of medical, penal, or political power). In emphasizing the need for subjects to resist all forms of "objectification," Foucault struggles against large institutional domination both in collective and in individualistic forms. His call is for a sort of "agonism," a term he uses to indicate an on-going resistance activity for freedom. In this newly expressed analysis of the subject and of freedom, Foucault seems to be echoing in secular political terms a central theme of theology from St. Paul, Augustine, Luther, and contemporary liberation theologians. Perhaps the literature of Latin America in the past thirty years - of 83</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE 84 Garcia Marquez, Cortazar, Amado, Paz, Fuentes, and others - might provide material for analysis in Foucault* s terms of pastoral power, agonism, and the subject of freedom. Finally, and closely connected to these recent themes in Foucault, stands his basic notion of the "fictionality" of human discourse and institutions. Trapped in its episteme, every age tends to see its structure as natural, inevitable, and unchangeable - from fedualism to capitalism to socialism. Foucault, like many modern social theorists, sees all such systems as fictions unconsciously created by the forces of established power. Evan an era's notion and treatment of insanity, sickness, crime, science or sexuality - as Foucault's major works have tried to show - all are humanly created institutions; all are changeable forms of discourse. However hyperbolic Foucault may be on this central point, his notion of fictionality offers several possibilities for use by a theologian of literature. First, the notion of 4 'fiction" is not that different from the theological notion of idol, a notion important for understanding any religious critique of the institutions of an age, as we can see in the biblical prophets, in Chaucer, in Swift, or in contemporary satirical novelists. Second, and crucial for any use of twentieth-century literary criticism, is the importance given by most schools - New Critical, structuralist, or post-structuralist - to the role of 4 'fictions." Although these various critical movements come from widely different philosophical premises, writers in them have discussed every aspect of the literary process - the author, the audience, the literary work, the world - all as fictive. In its extreme form, the emphasis on fictionality can lead to the textualization (i.e. trivialization) of literary study, an accusation Foucault has hurled at Derrida. In a moderate form, however, within a coherent theology of literature, such an awareness of the play of fictional devices is essential to an understanding of most innovative contemporary authors.18 Theological criticism of this sort must avoid, of course, the reduction of religion itself to merely another form of literary fiction, a danger ever-present since the time of Matthew Arnold. With the addition of a realistic epistemology, a notion of philosophical analogy, and an openness to the transcendent - all seriously rejected by Foucault - a theologian of literature can employ the eight elements of Foucault we have studied here. Within a wider vision, such a reader or critic can learn from Foucault, even from his exaltation of Nietzsche or Artaud, and use his method to see anew the movement in literature from Wordsworth and Holderin to Dostoievsky, Eliot, and the contemporary novel. 1 George Steiner, "Mandarin of the Hour," New York Times Book Review, February 28, 1971, pp. 8, 28-31; G.S.
