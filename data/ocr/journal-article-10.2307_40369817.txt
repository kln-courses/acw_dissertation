HAMILTON With the Assistance of BEN-RAY JAI AND HSIEN-HENG LU HEAVEN IS HIGH AND THE EMPEROR IS FAR AWAY LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE IN THE CHINESE STATE 1 In his analysis of Negara, the theater state in nineteenth-century Bali, Clifford Geertz challenges modern social science theory.2 His challenge rides on his penetrating account of the Balinese state, of a political order that he says is so different from Western states that the very concepts of "power," "authority," even "state" do not apply in the same way that they do in the West. In nineteenth- century Bali, power did not emanate from exercising will; authority had nothing to do with chains of command; and the political com- munity (i.e., the state) was not a delineated, protected territorial unit. Instead, power arose from performance, authority from virtue, and the state from "ceremony and prestige."3 Using Bali almost as a metaphor for what the West is not, Geertz goes on to question directly the validity of Western social science and to accuse its practitioners of universalizing Western cultural assumptions in the name of science. Although widely acclaimed Geertz's analysis, as well as his criti- cisms, have not been taken as seriously as they should be. 4 He has, of course, not helped his cause; he has marginalized his own obser- i Although I blame no one else for the results of this essay, I must acknow- ledge that I have not done this alone. Liu Kwang-ching's research on the nature of Chinese orthodoxy (which I term, following Weber, the principles of legitimacy) inspired me, gave me key insights that I have been exploiting ever since, and as it turns out, brought me back into China studies, after being absent for a number of years. Equally important for the present paper has been my students in a seminar class that I taught on this topic in 1985 while I was at Tunghai University in Taiwan. These advanced graduate students, in particular Jai Ben- ray and Lu Hsien-heng, told me where they thought I was right and where wrong, and contributed so many of their own ideas to the general theory of the Chinese state that I consider them co-authors. 2 Clifford Geertz, Negara, The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bah (Prin- ceton: Princeton University Press, 1980). 3 Geertz, Negara, p. 16. 4 For a comprehensive and often critical evaluation of Geertz's work, see Paul Shankman, The Thick and the Thin: On the Interpretive Theoretical Pro- gram of Clifford Geertz, "Current Anthopology" 25 (June, 1984): 261-279.

HAMILTON vations, by making them apply only to Bali. He straightforwardly rejects, as being too positivist, many theoretical and comparative analyses. He extols, instead, an extreme form of relativism, and prefers a literary style that incorporates and frames his culturally dense "thick descriptions."5 Geertz's view that Western and non-Western societies may differ intrinsically and that using Western-derived concepts to analyze non- Western societies 'may have pernicious results is interesting and, I believe, fundamentally sound. That these observations then lead to the conclusion that all comparisons are useless and invalid is, however, quite •mistaken. Indeed, systematic comparisons in line with this theoretical vision become all the more necessary and especially illuminating, for it is only through comparisons that one can achieve a perspective on what is unique. Moreover, as Geertz seems unwilling to acknowledge, this methodology of systematically analyzing uniqueness is already part of a developed theoretical per- spective that can be turned to the study of non-Western societies* This is, of course, the Weberian perspective, which has been used so profoundly in analyzing the distinctive features of the West. It is my contention in this paper that, in a reconstructed form, the Weberian perspective can also be used to extend Geertz's insights on non-Western political order beyond Negara. In this paper, I develop a comparative analysis of the political institutions in late imperial China that incorporates Geertz's important theoretical insights within a Weberian perspective. I The place to begin is with the claim that Western concepts of political structure are inappropriate for the analysis of late imperial China. Why this should be the case involves a basic theoretical point about the nature of social science explanations. Until recently, many thought of sooial science concepts as being universal tools of analysis, as being analytic, abstract, and neutral with regard to the societies being studied. These qualities derived from their deduction from what was believed to be general sociol- ogical properties of all societies. The reasoning was clear: All soci- eties, by definition, have certain functional or processual features. Kinship and political systems, socialization processes, stratification structures - these and many others ^features were thought to be necessary requisites for the very existence of society.6 Different 5 For Geertz's own explanations to his approach, see The Interpretation of Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973) and Distinguished Lecture: Anti Anti- Relativism, "American Anthropologist" 86 (1984): 263-278. o It should be noted that there is a Marxist equivalent to this functionalist argument, which in effect argues that each societies, by definition, has a funda- mental economic structure that necessarily consists of specific, functionally inter- related processes, contradictions, and class positions that change in predictable</page><page sequence="3">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 143 societies have different ways to satisfy the requirements of social order, but they all have to satisfy them nonetheless. Therefore, if one accepts this line of reasoning, to have good social science concepts means to abstract these requisites beyond the peculiarities of any one society. Arriving at this level of abstraction, these concepts were thought to be equally applicable to all groups that could be defined as societies, and hence their use in analysis of any one so- ciety was considered to be neutral with regard to the conclusions obtained. In principle, then, the concepts themselves bias neither the process nor the results of analysis. This confidence in the neutrality of social science concepts, as well as in the universality of their application, has now wanned. In the wake of this skepticism, a more self-conscious, self-critical theory of action, as well as of social science explanations, has become commonplace. 7 Central to these new concerns is a perception that subjective understandings, action, and structures are inseparable, even identical, elements of social worlds ; these social worlds - or lived in realities, as some would phrase it - are created from neither the actors' understanding of society nor the structures' con- straints on actors. Rather both actor understanding and structural reality are simultaneously produced and reproduced through actions. In other words, a context of ongoing action creates in participants both an understanding of what is happening and a "reality" or "social firmness" to the structures that have been created previously and are being recreated presently through their mutually directed actions. Most recently, Giddens calls this process "structuration." 8 But earlier thinkers, especially Weber and the great pragmatist phi- losophers, James, Dewey and Mead, saw with equal clarity the si- multaneity of structure's firmness and of actors' understanding, without either being analytically separate from or causally prior to the other.9 An acceptance of this simultaneity of meaning and structure has direct and profound effects upon fashioning satisfactory social science explanations. The direction of most modern thinking has been to require that sophisticated concepts of culture and meaning patterns be incorporated into social explanations. How this incorporation is ways. Nowadays, however, many scholars would argue that merely classifying a society according to its economic structure (e.g., feudal society) does, in fact, bias the results of analysis. 7 For a survey of and a contribution to this area, see Richard J.

HAMILTON to &lt;be accomplished, however, has not been established in any final way. Most writers have been content to work and rework social action theory, creating an array of abstract, analytic guidelines, but without producing much in the way of empirical understandings. Although these guidelines are diverse, they all share in the recognition that to understand (e.g., to explain) social life is to understand the simultaneity of structure, action, and meaning. A lew modern thinkers have tried to work out these ideas in a more empirical way. Foucault's effort to define historically the linkage between knowledge (i.e., meaning) and the institutions of control is the most influential, as well as the most important.10 Geertz, too, is an exception. He has arrived at his ideas through describing non-Western worlds. Both approaches, however, have led these two theorists to denounce modern social science, and they have become so engaged in the exercise to correct the positivist sins of the social science disciplines that they have retreated into so- lipsistic reveries on the wholeness and inseparability of time and place. n Among these and earlier like-minded theorists, Weber is virtually alone in the solution that he took to this recognition. Weber did not pursue abstract philosophic discussions of action in the ways that the pragmatists did, and that modern social theorists are now doing. Unlike Foucault and Geertz, he criticized the culturalist approach. 12 Instead of approaching his topic of study (e.g. Western civilization) ever more closely, as Geertz and Foucault advises us to do, he set Western civilization in a broad comparative framework. He argued that in order better to understand Western patterns of meaning, it is necessary to understand what is distinctive about those patterns, and the only way to understand the distinotiveness of one set of meaning patterns is to contrast it systematically with other patterns. Weber builds this comparative framework from his concepts, the famous "ideal types." 13 These concepts are analytic summaries of historically specific configurations. As distillations of particular types of social action, they are inductively derived, but then logically reformulated to exaggerate their distinctive constituent elements. With this methodology, Weber sets up an explanatory dialectic between !0 The most important of Foucault's books in this regard is Discipline and Punish, The Birth of the Prison (New York: Vintage Books, 1979). 11 For Geertz s critique, see Distinguished Lecture: Anti Anti-Relativism, Ame- rican Anthropologist" 86 (1984): 263-278), and for Foucault's, see The Order of Things, An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York: Vintage Books, 1973) and The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language (New York: Pantheon Books, 1972). 12 For his criticism of culturalist logic, see Weber's appeal for causal ana- lysis as opposed to the analysis of general "meaning patterns" in Max Weber on the Methodology of the Social Sciences (Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1949), especially Part III. i* tor a discussion ot Weber s methodology, see Guenther Koth, Introduc- tion," Economy and Society (New York: Bedminster Press, 1968), pp. xxix-xxxiv; and Guenther Roth and Wolfgang Schluchter, Max Weber's Vision of History (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979).</page><page sequence="5">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 145 the historical variability of that which he was attempting to explain and the analytic precision of inductive, but unreal concepts used in the explanation. At the conceptual level, Weber always constructed his typologies of action on what he saw as the "affinity" between normative meaning patterns and social structure, a relationship put into non-causal but intrinsic terms. His typology of domination, for instance, specifies three historically significant sets of politically directed actions designed to control subject populations. Each set shows the affinity between, indeed, the simultaneity of, a prescriptive "principle" of legitimation and an explicit organizational structure for the state. 14 Weber formulated his idea types based on his knowledge of Europe, and he generally used them to demonstrate the distinctive- ness of Western patterns. At times, Weber certainly overgeneralized his concepts; but, even so, because of his consistent focus on ex- plaining the West, he was generally able to maintain the explanatory dialectic - the ongoing linkage between the historical phenomena to be explained and the concepts used to clarify them - that formed the foundation of his comparative methodology. Weber's concepts, however, have had a life of their own beyond how Weber used them himself. His typologies of religion, of law, and particularly of the economy and of politics have had great in- fluence, not only in the study of the West, but also in the study of non-Western societies, China being one of these. If one carefully considers the methodological foundations of these ideal types, how- ever, there are obvious difficulties in using these concepts to under- stand non-Western societies in their own terms. This is exactly Geertz's quarrel with Weberian concepts.16 Gertz maintains that good explanations must encompass patterns of embedded meaning in order to understand surface actions and apparent structures. He states, "To describe [a structure of action] is to describe a constel- lation of enshrine ideas."16 Being Eurocentric, however, Weber's concept, when rudely applied to non-Western settings, break the dia- lectic between the internal bindedness of a social world and an observer's explanation of things that happen in that world. This broken dialectic is exactly what happens when Weber's own concepts are used to describe the political structure of imperial China.

HAMILTON II Patriarchy, patrimonialism, oriental despotism, patrimonial bu- reaucracy, imperial bureaucracy, administrative officials - these are just a few of the major concepts that Weber and other Western writers have applied to the analysis of China. Weber was, of course, not the first to apply many of these concepts, but his influence, together with that of Marx, has been the greatest. Now stripped bare of their focus on the West, Weberian and Marxian concepts are consistently used by sinologists, as well as by comparativists, to orient their analysis of China. In fact, no serious analysis of late imperial China has been undertaken without using these concepts derived from the West. What consequences flow from using these concepts that were first formulated from Western historical experience? Using the theoretical position outlined above, one would have to argue, with Geertz, that the use of Western concepts actually alters the analysts' perceptions of late imperial China. The bias is introduced because it sets up implicit, invidious comparisons between China and the West. Western-derived concepts, such as "bureaucracy" or even "class," have specific meanings in the context of Western history. Typically, these meaning are not fully defined, because they go beyond a simple delineation of traits to tap significant symbolic dimensions that evade simple definition. As a consequence, most concepts carry with them considerable cultural baggage, and when they are used without offloading that baggage, or at least without exposing the cultural meanings through explicit contrasts, they tend to highlight certain traits important in the West, but which may not be culturally or historically significant elsewhere. Those concepts surrounding and supporting Western political institutions are among the most important, as well as the most invidious, concepts used to analyze China. Therefore, in order to define the political order in late imperial China, it is useful to es- tablish, if only in summary form, a Western contrast model, which can be used to distinguish the Chinese model that I will develop in in the following sections. This contrast model gives the Western derived terminology that is frequently used to describe China a more substantial, historically rooted definition, thus allowing the differ- ences to emerge. What are the distinguishing features of Western states? To sim- plify the matter greatly, we can characterize Western political struc- tures in terms of three features: first, a centrist conception of legiti- mate power; second, a "top down" administrative conception of political organization; and third, a territorial unit in which the center's authority has legitimate jurisdiction. In the West, even in antiquity, Western political structure fixed upon symbolically articulated centers, with political power radiating</page><page sequence="7">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 147 out from there. One can debate the origins of this centrist concep- tion of power, but the most convincing explanation, and the one most scholars use, is simply that political authorities, from heads of households to heads of state, legitimated their exercise of authority through their exclusive access to divine, transcendental powers. 17 They ruled because they had a personal right to rule, a right derived directly from God or from His personal emissaries on earth or, as was also commonly the case in aristocratic Europe, from charismatic parentage. Rulers themselves sometimes claimed divinity, as did Ceasar, or, in the absolutist era, divine right, as did England's James I. This centrist conception was secularized in political philosophies and legalized as a part of legitimate state structure. Aristotle, in Politics, described such political centers as were found in Greek city states - polis, kings, aristocracies - and their effects upon the hap- piness of the respective political communities. The Roman Republic and later the Empire further systematized the state as a command structure. The center, which was first the Senate and later the Emperor, became symbolically the source of all commands. Obe- dience to the center's power ("Render unto Ceasar what is Ceasar's"), as well as the degrees of freedom for Roman citizens from that power was codified into Roman law. With this further system- atization, the state and its characterization as a center became an irreductible legal principle. With this legal foundation, Western states have developed in many ways, as Perry Anderson has shown so well. 18 But in all its various forms, Western state structures, founded upon this centrist conception, represented, as Weber de- picted them, "organized systems of domination." 19 In his analysis of Western states, Weber is quite right to des- cribe such organized systems of domination as administrative struc- tures and territorial units. 20 Conceptually, earthly powers, ranging from kings to heads of households have jurisdictions. Such juris- dictions are explicitly delimited by social and usually territorial units, within which the person at the center - the king, the pope, the judge, the father - can legitimately exercise his or, less frequently, her will. In the larger units, an administrative structure is created to link the center to the boundaries of the center's jurisdiction, in order to enforce the center's commands and to collect revenues necessary to sustain the apparatus. The administrative structure is legitimized by a political center that claims a monopoly upon the ultimate right of command and upon the rightful use of force within its territorial jurisdiction. This description of ithe political 17 See Robert Bellah's discussion of this point in Father and Son in Christia- nity and Confucianism, in "Beyond Belief" (New York: Harper and Row, 1970). is Perry Anderson, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism (London: NLB, 1974) and Lineages of the Absolutist State (London: NLB, 1974).

HAMILTON state is Weber's sociological conclusion, and Weber's typology of domination is his historical summary of the three conceptually most important ways that rulers in the West have legitimated and institu- tionalized the administrative linkages between themselves and their subjects. For the sake of this essay, let us conceive of this centrist con- ception of power, the corresponding administrative structure, and the territorial unit as a line and block chart. Such a diagram is the most common representation in Western societies of organiza- tional structures of all types. Let us further characterize the prin- ciple of domination in such an organization as being based upon the will, and concomitantly, upon the commands of the person at the top of the line and block chart, the president, the manager, the director, the leader in charge. Leaders may be good or bad, may give ap- propriate or inappropriate commands, but however they wield the power of their position, the commands given at the top, in principle, should effect the action of individuals located in lower ranks, of all who are located within the boundaries of the organization. One knows, of course, that in organizations of any size it is problematic that commands given at the top will be obeyed by those at the bottom, but we view this, as did Weber, as an aspect of the ongoing struggle between competing powers for centralization and decen- tralization. From this conception of the Western state comes the meaning of the concepts most often used to describe the Chinese state: bureau- cracy, patrimonial bureaucracy, bureaucrat, official, ruler, emperor, empire, even the term "state" itself. All of these are derived from and, in the Chinese context, implicitly tested against a centrist con- ception of political organization and state legitimacy, a conception, I suggest, that is without foundation in Chinese political organization. Ill Why might one expect the Chinese political order to differ from the Western model? The main reason one should expect the Chinese and Western state structures to differ dramatically is that, from a Weberian point of view, the principles of domination, and hence the ideas being institutionalized in structure, differ dramatically between the two locations. In the West, legimitation strategies had their structural origins in Christian cosmology. In China, however, there were no transcendental deities, no gods on high, from whom earth bound people would claim they obtained the right to rule. Hence, no centrist conception of power developed. In China, rulers did claim they had the "mandate of heaven" (tianming), but the dif- ferences between the amorphous "Heaven" of the Chinese and the anthropomorphic "God" of the West are many and large indeed. Heaven was not an explicit place, was not a willed, directed force, and could not be supplicated to or made to change its mind. Instead,</page><page sequence="9">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 149 heaven was the sun and moon, the planets in their motion, the night and day, the natural ways of life beyond earth (di) and beyond earth's most important inhabitants, mankind (ren). These three - heaven, earth, and mankind - formed the key trin- ity in Chinese cosmology. Each had their own roles to play, their own natures to follow; for one to deviate from its nature, even in small ways, would be to throw the entire system out of balance. There is no centrist conception in China, no "uncaused cause," no "unmoved mover,11 no one place from which all the forces of life emanated. As Joseph Needham put it, the Chinese knew of no billiard ball conception of causation, no God-centered view that pro- vided the West with such a basic cosmological foundation.21 In- stead, for the Chinese, the distinct, functionally different forces of life joined in a dance of harmony, a dance that had no cosmological beginnings, no absolute law-like motions, and no predicted endings. Everything and everyone were implicated, and so all were involved in this cooperative dance of life, even the dead, 22 so that the resulting image was of "an extremely and precisely ordered universe, in which things 'fitted' 'so exactly that you could not insert a hair between them."' 23 In contrast to the West's billiard ball conception of cau- sation, Needham called the Chinese model, "associative thinking," thereby everything has mutual influence on everything else. In this dance of distinct, but complementary parts, order does not come from the personal will of a leader in charge or from any exterior source, but rather only comes from each knowing and voluntarily fulfilling one's own part, even the emperor, who was called to his duties by 'means of a subordinate kinship term, tianzi, the Son of Heaven. Although these cosmological differences between China and the West are well known, their implications for political structure have barely been explored. For the purpose of this essay, let me mention three of the most important implications and some empirical evi- dence to support them. First, and most significant, Western and Chinese political prin- ciples dramatically differ. In the West, at both ideal and material levels, political philosophy is concerned with power, with the willed capacity of one person to determine the actions of another person. The relative measure of that capacity for power, the jurisdiction within which that capacity can appropriately operate, and the legiti- macy of the person's will are issues central to Western conceptions of power and corresponding social action. Equally, this over- whelming concern with commands and domination draws out the dialectical emphasis on freedom, contract, and individualism - all 21 Joseph Needham.

HAMILTON concepts that have been used to counterbalance the legitimacy and authority of hierarchical command structures. In China, however, the emphasis is not on the exercise of will, •but rather upon its opposite, upon "subduing self-willed actions and conforming to social expectations" (he ji fu Zi).24 Concern not with power and authority but rather with obedience (xiao) gives Chinese political thinking its substance. Action had to be justified func- tionally, in terms of its consequences to the group. Such an im- manent, non- transcendental justification removes in theory, though not always in fact, appeals to the charismatic qualities of the indi- vidual, which was so important to rulership in the West. Therefore, obedience was conceptually not seen as simply submission to another person, as would be implied in charismatic rule. Instead, obedience (xiao) called for each person to submit to the duties of one's own human roles - for the son to be a son, for the wife to be sl wife, and for the official (guari) to be an official.25 Submission is a required aspect of each role and submission is certainly directed to a specific person, thus requiring some elements of personal loyalty. But, non- etheless, the act of submission is rule-bound, is rigidly normative. Different rules of submission, implying a distinctive content to action, apply to different relationships, and, hence, the duty to obey is only located in specific social relationships, and is not a function of social locations, as would be implied by the territorial organizations (e.g., households, manors, cities and kingdoms) in the West. In this sense, obedience is embedded within relationships and not within jurisdictions. Second, without a centrist conception of power, and hence of competing centers, there would be no principled rationale for marking social and physical boundaries to locate subjects in relation to cen- ters. In a context of competing wills (e.g., kings vs popes, heads of household vs heads of state), the Western line-and-block mentality requires that jurisdictions be defined, that the content of commands be clarified, and that the extent of "self-determination" be spelled out. But in China, without a conception of conflicting wills, of those human billiard balls bouncing to and fro, there is no sense that social boundaries needed to be drawn. The Chinese drew boundaries for practical reasons - to aid the collection of taxes, to determine the "ownership" of land - but such boundaries were provisional and were generally "agreed upon" by the people involved.26 Westerners, however, draw boundaries for 24 This Confucian phrase (Confucian Analects, Book 12, Chapter 1) is usually translated as "Subdue the self and return to propriety." 25 This is a paraphrase of a passage from the Confucian Analects (Book 12, Chapter 11, Paragraph 2). The exact quotation is "There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son." 26 Some discussion ot customary law is round in ru-mei Chang Chen ana Ramon H.

Space connotes property, ownership, prerogative, and hence the right of command, and so Westerners are obessed with location because the self has no meaning without its being located in space. Accordingly, such a mentality fills space with people and their possessions, and requires that the geographical lines separating people be precise. Disputed lines result in argu- ments among neighbors, feuds among families, and wars among nations. By contrast, however, exact boundaries for Imperial China were never drawn until the nineteenth century, when Western powers began to mark off and claim territory. As Lattimore and Fairbank have variously explained, China's relationships with its neighbors were not defined by boundaries, but rather by tributary relationships (i.e., the willingness of the ruler of peripheral areas to submit to the Chinese emperor).27 China's international boundaries were frontiers without lines, and identified relationships (allies and enemies) rather than space. What would have been a border in Europe, the Great Wall, was in China only the beginning of the Chinese frontier; it never served as the border of the Empire. Equally, internal admi- nistrative boundaries were less than precise, were repeatedly changed throughout the dynastic period, and were in fact different for different sets of officials. Likewise, although land boundaries, and hence land ownership, were supposedly set by official surveys, in fact officials did not monitor the rights to land and did not officially set boundaries. This instead was controlled in a more informal way by local resi- dents. 28 Third, one should expect that, without a centerist legitimation for political power and without jurisdictions within which specific autho- rity prevailed, the Chinese political order would not develop a Western style administrative command structure. Without a strong centrist justification, such as that supplied by the Western gods, Chinese rulers would find it difficult to supply the rationale for a rationalized system of domination (that is, an administrative "top- down" command structure) that would radiate out from the emperor and that would connect everyone, logically, within a geographically defined matrix of command and compliance, as occurred in the West. We know, of course, that the Chinese government developed a complex political organization, but what evidence is there that China created an administrative structure like that which formed in the 27 John King Fairbank, On the Ch'ing tributary system, in John King Fairbank and Ssu-ju Teng, Ch'ing Administration: Three Studies (Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1960), 107-218.

HAMILTON West?29 I believe there are several reasons from the outset to question an assumption that the structures were similar. The first reason is that the numbers do not bear out this equation. The Da Qing Huidian of 1899 lists 20,000 officials serving in civil service posts. 30 The population for that period is usually calculated at 450,000,000. That works out to be a ratio of .000044 to 1, or approximately one half of an official for every ten thousand persons or 5 officials for every one hundred thousand persons. It is known, of course, that in imperial China the civil service was very small and that the unofficial "sub-bureaucracy" was much larger. But even if the sub^bureaucracy were added, the total number of officials is still very modest. Bastid, using the calculations of a number of people, estimates the total size of the sub-bureaucracy at 1.5 million. That figure includes servants, runners, secretaries, everybody. Ad- ding this figure to the 20,000 officials brings the total up to 3 gov- ernment related workers out of every ten thousand persons, but that still does not approach European standards. What were the comparable figures for Europe? Though hardly an administrative state then, France in 1665 still had 46,000 state officials in a population of 20,000,000. This makes 2 officials for every thousand people. In the late 1700s, on the eve of the French Revolution, there were 300,000 bureaucrats in France, which included minor city scribes and gate keepers, in a population of around 40,000,000. 31 That makes a ratio of 7.5 state paid workers for every thousand persons. France had the highest ratio, but in the same period England's ratio was 1.5, Prussia's was 2, and Spain's was 3 officials per thousand. 32 In the nineteenth century the percentage of state workers began rapidly to increase, so that by the turn of the twentieth century, all the European states averaged between 20 and 30 state workers for every thousand persons, the same period that China had 3 officials for every ten thousand persons. Their very numbers would indicate that the Chinese officials were not administrators in the same sense that Western officials were. But a second reason is even more to the point. Although I counted the so-called "sub^bureaucracy" in the calculations that I made 2» There is, of course, a long and developed literature on Chinese "bureau- cracy" and on Chinese "bureaucrats," and I certainly do not wish to argue here that this literature is inaccurate. The point I am making here is similar to that made by S.R. Schram and his collaborators, who have forcefully argued that the discussions of the Chinese state "is in part distorted," and that those distor- tions arise from "misunderstandings of which the causes lie in ourselves."

This unofficial apparatus developed gradually and in- formally to assist the magistrate in accomplishing his tasks, but was never strictly speaking a part of the state apparatus. In fact, it handled what would be considered in the West as the most important aspects of bureaucratic administration: tax collection, record keeping, and local pacification. The central government did not pay people to do these tasks, but rather the magistrate himself paid people to do them out of his own pocket, from the unauthorized surplus gained through tax collection. This sort of informal arrangement comple- tely runs counter to the logic of Western political structure. It is the very antithesis of "rational administration," if by that term we mean the development of systematic top-down command structures. Is the Chinese political structure a "failed bureaucracy?" Is it an illogically arranged distortion of what developed in a pristine way in the West, a corruption caused by, as Weber saw it, the presence of an exaggerated case of patriarchalism? 34 Or do we need to under- stand Chinese political structure in light of different concepts? After all, Chinese imperial organization, the longest lived political system in history, is hardly a failure from the point of view of longevity. IV If one grants, then, a certain validity to the argument that one should expect there to be large conceptual, as well as empirical, differences between Western and Chinese political structure, then what concepts are suitable for analyzing the Chinese case? The place to begin is with Chinese instead of Western concepts, and no concept is more important in determining the content of social action than xiao. Xiao is, in fact, the phenomenological counterpart to the Western concept of power.35 Xiao should be defined broadly, as the obligation to obey the duties of one's "role" as that role is defined within explicit sets of dyadic roles.36 In 33 For detailed information on the sub-bureaucracy, see T'ung-tsu Ch'u, Local Government in China under the Ch'ing (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1962) and John R. Watt. The District Magistrate in Late Imperial China (New York: Columbia University Press, 1972). 34 This is described in detail in Hamilton, Patriarchalism in Imperial China and Western Europe: A Revision of Weber's Sociology of Domination." 35 For more detail, see Hamilton, od. at., dd. 410418. 36 One of the most troublesome, and indeed questionable, aspect of this essay is my use of the Western concepts of role theory. I suspect, by merely using the terminology, that I am misinterpreting the Chinese case somewhat, but role theory seems as general and as nearly comparable to the Chinese situation as any theoretical terminology that I am aware of. Nonetheless a word of warning is in order.</page><page sequence="14">154 G.G. HAMILTON Chinese classical political thought, the legitimacy of the role sets, such as the parent/child relationship, is 'beyond question. Every person is morally required to submit to these natural roles; refusal to do so threatens the entire moral order. This logic is generalized to political structure as a whole. Polit- ical roles are defined, largely in dyadic terms, and are embedded in larger networks of complementary, mutually supportive roles. Ac- cordingly, as I will describe below, Chinese political organization is best characterized as a series of institutionalized roles arranged hierarchically. One can better understand this sort of hierarchy conceptually by setting it in opposition to the Western line and block model of the administrative state, and a way to do that is compare it to a structurally similar type of organization found in the West, the organization of universities. Such a comparison between the organization of Western schools and the Chinese state is not without some foundation, because the ideology of education lies at the very core of Confucianism. Students, faculty, and administrators form distinct categories of individuals, and different rules and regulations apply to individuals in each category. Within universities, there is, in theory, no distinct chain of command emanating from the administrator in charge down to every student. Instead, each person in each category fulfills their own duties, which are separate, distinct, but complementary. The focus in the university is supposedly the students and not the administrators, and the educational system ideally works for the overall benefit of students and of society in general; and the admin- istrators and faculties ideally serve the goal of student education. There is, of course, a system of domination present within schools. Administrators certainly influence the faculty members, and faculty members certainly influence students, but the system of domination is not, strictly speaking, a manifestation of the will of the admin- istrator in charge, but rather grows out of needs of those being edu- cated, the students themselves and the orderly process of education. This so-called "service orientation" de-emphasizes a centrist struc- ture and places, instead, considerable influence in the hands of educators - of faculties in Western universities and of the scholar/ manager (shi/guan) in imperial China. I will call this type of political organization a "status hierarchy." This organization consists of a hierarchically arranged set of roles that are largely self-contained and that are not linked by an explicit command structure. It is important to note that the Chinese have many symbolic representations of this type of organization: the carved ivory ball that contains free-floating balls within free-floating balls; the nesting boxes, which is a box within a box within a box. The outer one contains the inner ones without being directly or physically attached. In a simplified form, as illustrated in Figure One, this system of functional, autonomous nesting boxes or inner spheres symbolizes</page><page sequence="15">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 155 the Chinese political sytem. This conception of a status hierarchy corresponds to the FIGURE OHK DEPICTION OF CHINESE MPEBIAL STATE SIBUCTtflB EnPEROB HMRNNIZES UmUA j OFFICIALS HABHQNIZE ZMQHGfiJQ PARENTS AND HUSBANDS I HABffONlZE FAHILIES * I Confucian classification of the composition of the political com- munity during the late imperial period. There are four main status positions, only three of which fit together to form the nesting box conception of the Chinese political community. The four positions are the emperor (huangdi, tianzi), officials (guan), commoners {bai- xing), and outsiders (waireri). What follows is an attempt, using generally well-known infor- mation, to reconceptualize Chinese political structure based upon this conception of status hierarchy. I will briefly describe each of the four status positions, as represented in Figure Two, and then analyze the institutionalization of this nesting box system of political organization. Commoners At the symbolic center of the Chinese political organization is not the ruler, but rather the people. The classification for the com- moner status position is usually regarded as a depiction of strat- ification, but it is better regarded as a division of the human commu- nity into distinct occupation roles necessary for the maintenance of an orderly society. These roles are scholar, peasant, artisan, and merchant.</page><page sequence="16">156 G.G.

SLAMES Much has been made of the hierarchical arrangement of these roles, an emphasis that would makes this system similar to the estate system in feudal Europe. The emphasis is largely misplaced. On the one hand, the estate system blocked the mobility of indi- viduals from roles and defined their position in legalistic terms. On the other hand, different roles within the commoner status group does not imply, in late imperial China, any barriers to individual mobility, but rather did identify the moral, as well as the functional,</page><page sequence="17">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 157 behavior of people in those roles. In imeprial China, commoners could, in theory and in fact, move from role to role, but to be a scholar, a peasant, or any of the other roles was, morally, to act in particular ways and, normatively, to do particular things. Each of these roles was further specified, so that the behavior of a peasant, for instance, included on-going speculation about how peasants ought to live. In whatever role they occupied, however, commoners were expected to remain dutiful to the fundamental principles of life, most basic of which concerned obligations within the family, especially to one's parents and, in the case of women, to one's husband. Not to obey these duties was to put into question one's very humanity. In Europe, the king's court had jurisdiction over both nobles and commoners, but in China each status group was, in theory, self-maintaining, with each acting according to the •morality implied by their respective roles. Only in serious disturbances could offi- cials or the emperor himself legitimalety intervene in the affairs of commoners. All commoners were directly controlled and could be legitimately punished by their own parents and senior lineage members, who may reach their decision in a lineage council. (A Chinese saying puts it like this: "All nations have laws, all clans regulations.") In addition to control by kinship groups, commoners in different roles were subject to control by dispute-solving mecha- nisms internal to that role. Peasants had their village councils, which in southern China often overlapped with a kinship group. Artisans and merchants organized into guilds and regional associations, orga- nizations which could create regulations and punish offenders. Only when disputes could not be resolved internally did cases go to the officials for resolution. Officials would normally resolve civil dis- putes and perhaps assign criminal blame on the basis of the moral principles breached in the case. If the case involved a family, offi- cials would invoke kinship principles and lineage regulations; if the case involved merchant activities, they might check the specific guild regulations that had been broken. An important, recurring question in philosophic discussions illus- trates the relation between commoner and official statuses and the nature of status roles in general. The question concerns which comes first, an official's obligation to the emperor, which is based upon loyalty (zhong), or his obligation to his parents, which is based upon filiality (xiao). Which role and role principle takes precedence is not important to this discussion, although I should note that scholars and statesmen came down on both sides of the issue. What is important here is that the very issue emphasizes the gap between status positions and the distinctive, separate moral nature of each role. In imperial times, the Chinese partially resolved the official's role conflict between family and state by requiring that an official resign his post upon the death of a parent, so that he, a sa com- moner, could perform his family obligations. In the end, being a</page><page sequence="18">158 G.G. HAMILTON commoner was the most basic status, the sine qua non of civilized society, the center around which the rest of the political order revolved. Officials The officials occupied the second status position, the moral sphere located between that of the emperor and that of commoners. In this sphere, Chinese officials were not administrators in the Western sense of that term, but rather were educators and judges, exemplars par excellence. This fact is clearly suggested by their small numbers and by the fact that these numbers did not increase as they did in the West. Their very numbers would indicate that the Chinese officials were not administrators whose responsibility was to implement the emperor's orders. Indeed, the official rationale for having officials in the first place was not to serve the emperor by carrying out his commands, but instead, to serve the emperor by setting a moral example and by educating the people. There are lengthy discussions in the Confucian classics and later commentaries about how to become worthy of being such a scholar/manager and how to perform the duties of the role. The important point here is to understand that, in the Chinese conception, the functionality of the official role tlowed from its profound ethical and moral content. Officialdom was a status position that, in principle, demanded of individuals the highest level of moral commitment. It was not a group of func- tionaries, people with technical duties, as it was in the Western sense of bureaucrat.37 As with the commoner's sphere, the official's sphere was also separate from other spheres and was, in theory, self-maintaining. It was far removed from the position of commoners, who in fact had very limited mobility into this status position, but it was even fur- ther removed from that of the emperor. Officials had no mobility whatsoever into that position, not even in the case of an emperor who had lost the mandate of heaven. Commoners could conceivably become an official by proving their moral qualifications; they had to pass through several levels of examinations and only then were they considered for apointment to serve the emperor in an official capacity. After the examinations and appointment, the official would go through a "rite of passage" which would normally culminate in an audience with, and a pledge of loyalty to, the emperor. Besides being separated from other statuses, the role of officials had, in theory, a distinctive self-maintaining part to play in attaining harmony and order. The responsibility of the officials was not to govern the commoners, as would be the case in a European state. Instead, the defining quality of their role was loyalty (zhong) to the 37 For the origins of the Western concept of bureaucrat, see Bendix's essay on "Bureaucracy" in Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth. Scholarship and Parti- sanship (Berkeley: University of California Press. 1971).</page><page sequence="19">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 159 emperor, and in the Chinese system this meant that they were to be exemplars, setting the moral standards to which commoners should aspire. This was fundamentally the duties of an educator, not an administrator. If one examines the regulatory apparatus established among the officials, one discovers a system designed to control the officials themselves, to hold them to their responsibilities and to keep them virtuous and honest. Only a great amount of imagination can make it into a system whose purpose was to extend the ruler's power into local society. For instance, by repute the most despotic rulers of late imperial times, Ming Taizi and Yongzheng, both established their reputations by divising methods to regulate the activities of high ranking officials, not by attempting to control commoners at all. Ming Taizi even went so far as confine his district magistrates to the county seat, forbidding them from going into the countryside and "disturbing the people." Yongzheng improved and extensively used the palace memorial system, so that officials could secretly report the corruption of other officials. As Silas Wu concludes, "In the Qing imperial government, the key facet of political control was control over the high-ranking bureaucrats," which was designed in part to meet "the Chinese people's value demand that the government fulfill its responsibilities."38 Moreover, as Thomas Metzger shows, the regulatory mechanism that controlled the behavior of officials was restricted to people of that status.39 It was not a part of a general legal framework applicable to all, but rather was aimed at this specific status group. In short, the state apparatus, so famous in the West as a first attempt at creating an administrative state, is perhaps better seen as a framework of ranks, procedures, and regulations creating a self-contained, self-regulating status group. The revenues gained from land taxation made the officials largely self-sustaining. As individuals they were not dependent upon stipends bestowed upon them by the emperor. Instead, the entire salary and support systems for officials were handled by officials. Apropos of their duty to provide for peace in the empire, the officials also used rice gained from taxation for the state granary system, which provided people with food during such natural disasters as droughts and floods. Emperor "Tian gao huangdi yuan" (Heaven is high and the emperor is far away) is a common expression that symbolically identifies the position of the emperor in the Chinese political system. The emperor is called the "son of heaven," and as emperor he had earned the "mandate of heaven." In relation to other groups, the emperor 3« Silas H.L. Wu.

HAMILTON "holds up heaven/' and his sphere of responsibility was tianxia, everything beneath heaven. The emperor's explicit duties included most prominently his personal ritual worship of heaven, which he alone performed twice each year at the Altar of Heaven. The em- peror is, then, the closest to heaven, performs duties in relation to heaven, and occupies the role of the outermost sphere comprising the Chinese political community. There are a number of concrete manifestations of this positioning. The emperor had the responsibility for all relations with non-Chinese outsiders. One aspect of this was the tribute system, and another the emperors' control of foreign policy, including the waging of wars on the frontier. Another manifestation could be seen in spatial terms. In relation to other people, the emperor was always up. In court his seat was physically elevated on a dais, and officials in an audience were required to remain on their knees. Even any refer- ence to the emperor or his desires "was always separated from, and elevated above (taitou), the rest of the lines of any document in which it appeared."40 The emperor's sphere was not occupied by him alone. In theory, at least, his sphere, like the others, was autonomous and self- maintaining. He was sustained by imperial household estates and by revenues gained from foreign trade, some types of domestic trade (e.g., licensing salt merchants) and particular household enter- prises, such as the manufacture of porcelain. He was served by particular types of household personnel (e.g., eunuchs, bondservants, and disstaff relatives) who provided advice, clerical help, and all manner of personal service for him and the entire imperial family. The emperor, in residence within the imperial household, was phy- sically separated from all contact with commoners, as well as offi- cials, except in the performance of ritual tasks at predetermined sites. In theory, the emperor harmonized the relations between heaven, earth, and mankind. In fulfilling these obligations, he served heaven. From the affairs of everyday life, he was far away, as far as heaven is high. Unlike Western rulers, such as Louis XIV, the Sun King, the Chinese emperor was not the center out of which the flow and meaning of life radiated. Instead, he was the outer sphere, the protective covering, so to speak, that ensured that the flow of other peoples' lives would be orderly and peaceful.41 40 Richard J. Smith, China's Cultural Heritage, The Ch'ing Dynasty, 1644-1912 (Boulder. Colorado: Westview Press. 1983V d. 33. 41 As James L. Watson shows, however, commoners completely accepted the notion that the emperor was far away, but this also suggested to them that the emperor was "a remote and dangerous entity, outside the norms of ordinary human compassion." ("Waking the Dragon: Visions of the Chinese Imperial State in Local Myth," in Hugh Baker (ed.). Maurice Freedman Memorial Issue, Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford. Forthcoming, 1988). This "normative" commoners's view of the emperor accords perfectly with the notion that the emperor occupies a distinctive, status position that is distant from ordinary life and that normally has nothing to do with that life; this is a view quite different that "normative" view of European commoners.</page><page sequence="21">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 161 Outsiders The last status position is that of the outsider. This is the status of individuals who, although they live within boundaries of China, were not regarded as full members of the political community, and thus had no legitimate place within it. Lacking an exact role, and thus not needing to act according to precise, predetermined moral principles made this an extremely useful category of people in a political order in which there are large gaps between rigorously defined status groups. Outsiders in China had served the very im- portant inside role of being status intermediaries (zhongjianreri), by bridging the gaps between status positions. Using people that had no standing within the political community facilitated such com- munication between status roles as would otherwise result in a loss of "face" for both parties. Outsider were sub-classified into people who are not ethnically Chinese (non-Han) or who, for a number of reasons, were not ethically Chinese. This last group, the not-ethically Chinese, were the ones most often used as status intermediaries, but not exclu- sively so, as a long line of foreigners from Marco Polo on can testify. These people were categorized as "mean people" (jianmiri), which is a classification that implies some form of heterodoxy or funda- mental disreputability. Examples of these people include slaves, eunuchs, prostitutes, and a number of semi-hereditary occupations, including bandits, revolutionaries, and yamen runners. People in this group were ineligible to sit for the civil service examinations, as all commoners were able to do regardless of their occupation or condition in life. Like non-Han people, mean people did not conform to a Chinese way of life or were excused from acting in a fully Chinese manner, both of which were sufficient to push them beyond the bounds of reputability, and hence made them useful when pro- cedures of decorum would not work. V How did these four status positions function in regard to the operation of the state? In this final section, I want to examine briefly one dimension regarding the institutionalization of power in the Chinese imperial state, namely the justification and transmission of orders. In order to highlight the distinctiveness of the Chinese political system, I will begin with a contrast with Western state structure. Were the Chinese system based on a centrist conception of polit- ical power, then one would expect the emperor to be in charge of an administrative structure, the officialdom, which in turn governs com- moners on behalf of the emperor and in relation to his commands. Let us call this manner of organizing authority relationships a "com- 11</page><page sequence="22">162 G.G. HAMILTON mand structure," and the type of organization arising from such a command structure an "administrative bureaucracy." This interpretation, which is the one usually applied to political organaization in imperial China, is, I believe, a misapplication of Western theory. Chinese political organization is best viewed as a status hierarchy. It represents a "status structure" rather than a command structure. In the West, power is embedded in command Structures and is defined in relation to administrative jurisdictions and to individuals who have command responsibilities within those jurisdictions. Accordingly, individuals in positions of power have the right to transmit their will (as qualified by a particular post) to others within their jurisdictions. In China, in contrast, only correction of inappropriate behavior is allowed. In China, this key idea of correction conveys the legitimate basis by which individuals in various locations in the system can direct someone else's action. This idea is found in the most obvious place, in the very word for government itself. "Zhengzhi" is always simply translated as "government," but the characters imlpy a different meaning than the one with which we are familiar for government. The root radical of zheng means correct or appropriate behavior: to be upright, to be true to form. The other part of the character means to follow. "Zhi," the second character of the term, means to heal, to cure. This term, zhengzhi, precisely describes the system of government in China: The powers are to follow correct behavior themselves and to set right that which is incorrect. Power, in other words, does not issue from commands, but rather from conformity. Jacques Gernet and Bastid argue that for China '"To govern is to regulate, maintain harmony and equilibrium, not to command and compel.' We are led to think of the opposition between the power of constraint (kratos) which defines political power in Greece, and the Chinese notion of government: zhi, to gov- ern, signifies literally to regulate, especially to regulate the flow of water, to treat and to heal." 42 The Emperor governed by correcting and by healing, not by issuing positive laws in the European sense. Though not a law maker, the Chinese emperor did issue instruc- tions. Leon Vandermeersch gives a classification of imperial edits, which, in the Western sense would seem to be commands. In China, however, these categories of sovereign decisions "in no way denotes positive laws; (they) refer to the fundamental laws of nature insofar as these are models for the right conduct of government." The de- velopment and use of models and standards, not the issuing of laws, is at the center of imperial decisions. In a key passage, Vander- meersch contrasts the Western notion of law with the Chinese notion of ritual order. The principle of the ritual order is altogether different social relations, in that order, are modeled upon forms - rites - which are 42 Schram (ed.), The Scope of State Power, p. xxxi.</page><page sequence="23">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 163 the reasons (li, principles) of things. Only in conformity with those reasons can the world function harmoniously. Once the rites have been respected, and harmony has thereby been introduced into society, each individual spontaneously behaves as is most fitting for all and for himself ....People are persuaded to subject themselves to the rites by the prestige and the imposing forms of the greatest cere- monies, and by the ascendancy, and the example, of the highest per- sonages of the social hierarchy. This is why the most important edicts are those which concern great liturgical celebrations and those which involve great dignitaries. The sovereign, being in possession of the Way, has only to determine, on each occasion, the conduct of those who are to give the example. This is decided on the basis of their place in the hierarchy, and the rest follows of itself. The Chinese, after all, have always upheld as their model the administrator who never inter- venes in the affairs of those whom he administers, the latter acting, under the influence of his virtue, in spontaneous conformity with the norms of the social order. Lu, the Chinese term for law, properly denotes the laws of musical harmony - constants of the social order, just as certain proportionalities of pitch are constants of the har- monic order.43 The political system in China was founded upon correction and healing, as opposed to commands and administration of commands. How was such a system institutionalized? As described above each group has institutionalized within it a self-regulating capacity. Par- ents had the responsibility in regard to their children, and hence have legitimate power over them when they act inappropriately. In late imperial times a parent could even put their child to death if he or she violated the behavior required by xiao (filiality). District officials, which were known colloquially as "parental officials" (fumu guari), had a similar relationship with commoners within their dis- tricts. If parents or officials failed to act and if their subordinate's misbehavior caused a public disorder, then higher ranked persons could become involved. A lineage council imay be called to dis- cipline the child, and the official would likely be removed and pun- ished by higher ranking officials or the emperor himself. As disorder spreads, more and higher ranked people become involved in res- toring order, while others may 'be punished for allowing the disorder to continue. This type of political system rests on a presumption of clear, well defined roles in which authority, in principle, is invoked only when role incumbents do not fulfill their duties. As can be recognized immediately, this arrangement might be very effective in maintaining, literally, the status quo, but would be very ineffective when decisions made at the top need to be carried out quickly and efficiently by people in other status groups. It is in this regard that we can understand the informal systems of decision-making and of transmission of orders that developed over 43 Schram (ed.), The Scope of State Power, p. 13.</page><page sequence="24">164 G.G. HAMILTON time in the Chinese state. These often complex informal systems circumvented the two major status gaps that existed in the Chinese status hierarchy, the first between the emperor and officials and the second between officials and commoners. In each informal system two channels of communication and transmission develop, a direct one allowing formal communication between unequals, and an indirect one allowing informal communication through status intermediaries. I will briefly describe each of these systems. In late imperial times, but particularly during the Qing period, the last dynasty, the emperors Gangxi and Yongzheng desired a method of direct communication with high ranking officials that allowed a measure of confidentially between the emperor and official. Before that time audiences and memorials to the emperor were ritualistic and were handled largely by officials for their own pur- poses. Gangxi began to develop a secret memorial system, which allowed the top officials to write to him without other officials knowing of the communication. The documents, which were sup- posedly formal greetings to the emperor, were read only by the emperor and a few household officials. During the reign of Yong- zheng, who followed Gangxi, the secret memorial system was rou- tinized, and a special group of household officials, who were "inner grand secretaries," were established as the Grand Council to read the secret memorials, then to advise the emperor about possible courses of action, and to transmit documents signed by the emperor to the appropriate location in the status apparatus of officialdom. The second aspect of this informal system between the emperor and officials was the indirect means of communicating with officials and of transmitting documents. Since very early times, and with great consistency in the last two dynasties, the standard means of communicating between the emperor and official was by a "mes- senger" from the imperial household. Most of these messengers were eunuchs, and sometimes in the Qing, bondservants. Especially during the Ming dynasty, these status intermediaries managed all aspects of the indirect contacts between the emperor and officials. For example, according to Robert Crawford, From 1471 to 1497, Hsien-tsung (1465-1488) and Hsiao-tsung (1488- 1506) held no audiences with their ministers. Wu-tsung (1506-1522) held no audiences as he was more frequently engaged in wandering about in disguise. For forty-five years of his reign, Shih-tsung (1522-1567) held only one audience. From 1589 to 1602, Shen-tsung (1573-1620) met his ministers only once and this because of an attempt on the Heir Apparent's life.44 Without audiences, however, the government did not cease, as it would have in Europe, because status intermediaries - the infamous Ming eunuches - advised the emperor, draften and delivered cor- 44 Robert B. Crawford, Eunuch Power in the Ming Dynasty, "T'oung Pao" 49 (1961-62), p. 115.</page><page sequence="25">LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURE 165 respondence to officials, served as the emperors' guards and doormen, managed the imperial estates, watched over the emperors' fiscal in- terests in foreign and domestic trade, administered the imperial treasury, and sometimes led the emperors' armies and navies.45 Throughout the imperial period, these officially disreputable indi- viduals served as eyes, ears, and hands of the emperor in all his indirect contacts with the world outside of the imperial household. In so doing, these go-betweens earned the undying enmity of officials, whose writings consistently damn their presence. This type of informal system used to circumvent the status gap between emperor and official is repeated for the relations between officials and commoners. As Fei Xiaotong writes, the office of the magistrate "was as high as the sky - so high, indeed, that no ordi- nary person could reach up to it! " 46 Magistrates, nonetheless, rou- tinely made direct, but informal contact with commoners through informal discussions held with the group of commoners who held the role of scholar. These individuals were degree-holders (shenshi), people who had passed one of the levels of examinations, but who held no appointment in officialdom. Both being cultivated (in the Chinese meaning of that term), official and local scholars could meet on common ground. Though certainly not on the same level, they could nonetheless informally circumvent the gap that lie between them by virtue of their common training. Moreover, scholars were the only group of commoners that could freely enter the site of the magistrate's office and, as Ch'u T'ung-tsu writes, "it was the only group that could legitimately represent the local community in dis- cussing local affairs with the officials and in participating in the governing process."47 The exchange of information was informal but was decisive nonetheless, because there was no other direct channel by which desires on either side could be communicated. The indirect means of communication between officials and com- moners handled by far most of the contact between the two groups. As with the indirect contact between the emperor and officials, the indirect contact at this level was made through status intermediaries. In the words of Fei Xiaotong, Those who made the actual contact between the yamen (the magistrate's office) and the people, the ruler and the ruled, were the servants of the officials. These officials servants (yayi) occupied one of the lowest positions in the Chinese social scale; they were deprived of most of their civil rights, and their sons were not allowed to take the examinations. It is significant point in the Chinese power 45 Crawford, op. cit.; also see Jung-pang Lo, Policy Formulation and Decision- Making on Issues Respecting Peace ana War. in Charles O.

HAMILTON structure that these men who were in the position of most easily abused power should have been held so low. 48 Indicative of such intermediaries in Chinese society, those having the most contact with non-scholar commoners were the lowest ran- ked. "Lictors, horsemen, foot messengers, ..., coroners, jailers, door- men, archers" and others similarly employed were ranked very low, but "the policemen occupied the most inferior position of all the government runners." 49 That policemen were so lowly ranked, a stigma that extended to their children as well, is a clear indication of the status-violating tasks they performed in a political system organized as a status hierarchy. Were the Chinese state organized as an administrative system with an explicit command structure, those funcions handled by such people as eunuchs and yamen runners would be in the hands of those honored among all others. VI Max Weber's political sociology contains deeply seated Euro- centric biases, but Weber's equally deep insights into the nature of political organizations of all types provides a theoretical basis by which Clifford Geertz's notion of non-Western political order can be reconceptualized and extended. Geertz's analysis of the Balinese theatre state, Negara, also can be applied to China. The Chinese state is fully a non-Western state; like Negara, the Chinese state is based upon principles quite distinct from those undergriding Western political systems, and to use only Western concepts to understand these political orders is to misunderstand them entirely. But, having said that, one must also emphasize that there is much to distinguish between the Chinese and Balinese state structure. The political elites in Negara are aristocrats by virtue of birth; in imperial China, they are scholars by virtue of passing the examination. In Negara, the emperor was an "exemplary center" the very model of good behavior. But in China, this role fell to the scholars, while the emperor was distant and active in creating order in the world. While there was certainly pomp and ceremony at court, the emperor's presence did not come from mere prestige. He had the obligation to correct disorder in the world, and in this role he and his forces could be terrible, fierce, and cruel. Through his intermediaries, the emperor had his personal armies, could claim vast imperial lands, and had his own sources of revenues and supplies. The emperor was not a passive observer or a royal recluse. To commoners, he was dragon that had best be left asleep. 50 ^8 Fei.

Geertz too often substitutes drama for concepts, deep descriptions for probing contrasts. He makes Negara into a metaphor that symbolizes what the West is not. But such a metaphorical framework is not, at the same time, a comparative framework. Geertz strips his analysis of concepts that would allow the East and West to be juxtaposed, so that the dif- ferences can be explored and explained more fully. In this sense Negara, as an intellectual product, is really a "theatre" state; however brilliant, Geertz's characterization contains much theatrical perfor- mance and too little intellectual substance. Weber can be justly criticized for leaving out too much history from his analysis, for not digging deeply enough into cultural meaning patterns. Indeed, Geertz's and Foucault's writings add depth to Weber's insights. Although Weber's framework does not substitute for deep structural analysis, it does, however, identify those areas of theoretical and substantive significance upon which a deep structural analysis can proceed. Without careful theoretical preparation based upon a comparative analysis, cultural analysis is often directionless and strangely empty. That is because theoretical reconstructions and historical revisions are not separate exercises, but rather are both aspects of the singular act of understanding the human condition. In this regard, historical, comparative analysis has a large part to play in analyzing the theatre state of Bali, as well as the distant emperor in imperial China.
