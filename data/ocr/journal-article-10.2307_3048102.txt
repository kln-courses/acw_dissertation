Pp. xxvi &amp; 257; 420 figures on 172 plates. $15.oo. The author states his threefold thesis in the preface and first chapter of this imposing book: I. Greek temples are to be regarded "as physical embodiments of the gods in sacred places" (p. ix); they were "themselves an image, in the landscape, of his [the god's] qualities" (p. I). 2. "The landscape and the temples together form the architectural whole, were intended by the Greeks to do so, and must therefore be seen in relation to each other" (p. 2). 3. One must recognize "a willed form in the or- ganization of the sanctuary as a whole" (p. 4); "the buildings in Greek temene should be regarded as phrases in a developing language. Each makes a state- ment which is joined by others as new buildings are added, sometimes over many generations" (p. 5). This is a big and challenging theme, and one that should be taken seriously by every student of the clas- sical world. Scully approaches the subject with great zest, quite undaunted by the preponderance of nega- tive conclusions reached by earlier scholars. The main body of the book is intended to document the opinions set out above; attention is concentrated especially on the second article. By its very nature the investigation called for autopsy, to achieve which the author has spared no pains. In the course of a year's sojourn in Greek lands he visited some one hundred and fifty sanctuaries, among them all those on which he lays special stress, with the sole exception of Assos which was "seen only from a distance" (p. ix). His bibliography attests a thorough perusal of the archae- ological literature, while numerous quotations drawn chiefly from Homer, the Homeric Hymns, Pindar, and the Attic dramatists show that he has taken some cognizance also of the views of the ancients. The text is generously supplemented by illustrations: a series of maps; plans of the principal sanctuaries and of many individual temples; photographs of the ancient build- ings seen in relation to the surrounding landscape. These views of the natural settings, often in series of several pictures devoted to a single site, form a very valuable part of the book; they will be used, no doubt, and appreciated by many readers who may find it dif- ficult to subscribe to Scully's opinions. The sites that we are invited to visit under the au- thor's guidance are arranged roughly in chronological sequence from Minoan to Hellenistic times. In Crete the author concerns himself chiefly with the palace sites, above all with the palaces as holy places. He re- gards the buildings not merely as the dwellings of the Mother Goddess but as her very body (p. I 2). A pattern is detected in the relation between the palace and its setting. The building was regularly sited in an enclosed valley, a "natural megaron," and it was so placed that a conical hill rose on its axis as projected to north or south while a higher mountain of two- horned or cleft shape was visible on the same axis at a greater distance. These hills are supposed by the author to have been regarded by the ancients as images of the female breast or breasts, or as the female lap, or the mons Veneris. The female element is thought to have been identified with the Mother Goddess. More summary consideration is given to the choice of site for prehistoric settlements on the mainland of Greece where the author is inclined to suspect that similar principles were at work. He concludes with a comparison between the palaces of Crete and the great sanctuaries of the Bronze Age in Britain, viz. Stone- henge and Avebury: the Cretan buildings were ori- ented in relation to physical features of the landscape, the British monuments, set in featureless landscapes, were aligned with the heavenly bodies. From Minoan Crete we move to the Mycenaean mainland. Here the author finds that the palaces of the Bronze Age, as also the temples by which they were sometimes replaced, were sited, like the Cretan pal- aces, in relation to conical hills and more distant double or horned peaks. In those cases, e.g. Athens, Eleusis, Pylos, Tiryns, where these principles were scrupu- lously observed, the outcome was a long and blessed existence. But Gla, whose "citadel as a whole floats... without links to the land" (p. 31), was doomed speed- ily to fall before the iron swords of the Dorians and thereafter to be abandoned and forgotten. At Mycenae the Achaean lords in their arrogance usurped for themselves the goddess' place on the conical hill, and Mycenae became the "setting for the most terrible of myths, all of them having to do with the punishments consequent upon the human lust for power" (p. 40). An interesting foil to this mystical approach is pro- vided by Porphyrios Dikaios in his recent book on a Neolithic settlement in Cyprus (Sotira, University Mu- seum, Philadelphia, 1961). Dikaios, from long experi- ence in his native island, conceived the notion that the earliest settlements were likely to have been estab- lished near perennial springs; working backward, he then succeeded in locating a number of early settle- ments by searching in the proximity of such springs. In the general collapse at the end of the Bronze Age not only the old buildings but also the old archi- tectural types perished, to be replaced after the dark centuries by something quite different, the classical Greek temple. Yet the sanctity of many of the ancient holy places persisted. There survived also, in the au- thor's opinion, the old feeling for an organic relation- ship between the temple and its physical environment, the most significant elements of which continued to be the conical and the two-horned hills in axial com-</page><page sequence="2">278 THE ART BULLETIN bination. In post-Dorian times, however, another prin- ciple of orientation came into play. Based on celestial rather than terrestrial points of reference, this new principle required a temple to face toward the rising sun. The old and the new systems often came into conflict. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other dom- inated, and various compromises were effected. Athens is a particularly interesting case. Here, despite the traditional continuity from the Bronze to the Iron Age, the temples of the Athenian Acropolis have been claimed by Dinsmoor, followed by Scully, to be ori- ented with astonishing precision in relation to the sun as it rose on the feast days of their respective divinities. Most fortunately for the author's theory, however, these temples can also be brought into satisfactory re- lationship with conical and two-horned formations on Mount Hymettos. The varied application of the two basic principles is then illustrated by reference to a number of famous sanctuaries in which Hera was wor- shiped as Olympic queen and mother: Perachora, Samos, Olympia, the Argive Heraeum, and some of the great sites of Magna Graecia. The sanctuaries of Demeter conform in general, according to the author, with his first principle, their buildings standing in significant relation to conical and double peaks. But the buildings display great di- versity among themselves both in the details of their relationship with the surrounding landscape and in their architectural form. This is regarded as a natural consequence of the diversity in the cult of a goddess who had links with both the upper and the nether worlds. The author rightly emphasizes the fact that in the most famous of all Demeter sanctuaries, Eleusis, the principal structure, the Telesterion, was a closed building within which the worshipers gathered to ob- serve the sacred rites; in this respect the Telesterion differed from the normal pagan temple and anticipated the Christian church. In startling contrast to the Telesterion at Eleusis, the "Temple of the Two Goddesses" at Thorikos in eastern Attica is restored by Scully (and by other schol- ars) as a peristyle without walls. A series of four col- umns from this temple have recently been recognized, however, in the Athenian Agora, whither they were transported for re-use in the early Roman period. With the columns were found a number of wall blocks clearly from the same building. (The Athenian Agora: a Guide, 2nd ed., I962, pp. 27, 90). The temple at Thorikos is therefore to be restored with a closed cella. The same is undoubtedly true also of the temple at Segesta in Sicily which Scully was inclined to classify with the Attic building as an empty ring of columns; in the right light one can still distinguish the shallow beddings for normal cella walls which have evidently been thoroughly pillaged for the sake of their stone. The columns of the temple at Thorikos were left unfluted in the Greek period, and the same is true of a number of other temples such as those at Rhamnous and Segesta. Scully accepts the current view that the incompletion was due initially to the exigencies of war; but he argues that men were inhibited from re- suming the work in later times by religious considera- tions. This argument is weakened, however, by the number of secular buildings that had similar histories. It may be noted in passing that the siting of the sanctuaries of Demeter has been discussed recently by a French scholar, Y. B6quignon, who concludes that the goddess had a marked predilection for steep hill- sides ("Demeter, deesse acropolitaine," Revue Arche- ologique, II, 1958, pp. 149-177). The catalogue of divinities continues: Artemis and Aphrodite, Apollo, Zeus, Poseidon, and Athena. Their sanctuaries great and small are related by the author to the surrounding landscape; and the natural setting provided by mountain, plain, and sea is found to be in harmony with the temper of that aspect of the divinity that is uppermost on each particular site. A final chapter, "The Individual and the Gods," is concerned with Hellenistic developments in temple architecture and in the layout of sanctuaries, with town planning, and with the part played by such prominent structures as temples and theaters in relating the town- site to its natural environs. Throughout Hellenistic times, the author maintains, attention continued to be paid to coordinating the axes of temples, of sanctuaries, and of cities with features of the distant landscape. At Pergamon, where nature had been niggardly in the provision of suitable features, a conical hill in the form of a tumulus was erected in the plain by the kings! An analysis of the Sanctuary of Fortune at Praeneste fails to reveal a significant coordination between the com- plex of buildings and the surrounding landscape. "Praeneste, like the work of the great architects of the Renaissance who studied it, might therefore have ap- peared to the earlier Greeks as at once illiberal, timid, and impious" (p. 212). Thus far our author. The unprejudiced reader may well be carried away by Scully's fluent, often eloquent prose, by the warm sympathy with which he endeavors to enter into the spirit of the ancient planners, and by the apparent success with which he has shown the planning of so many ancient sites to conform with the principles enunciated in his opening pages. As one turns the plates at the back of the book, however, doubts may well begin to arise. Whereas the written statement implies that the relationship between temple and distant mountain is clear and compulsive, the situation seems far different in the pictures. Al- though most of the photographs have been taken spe- cifically to illustrate the thesis of the book, the average reader's credulity is likely to be strained as he en- deavors to recognize significance in the groupings of conical mound and cleft mountain. The reader familiar at first hand with the Mediterranean scene will object that conical mounds and cleft-mountain profiles are features of such universal occurrence that they must inevitably appear in relation to almost any temple. The point is well illustrated by reference to the photographs intended to bring out the relation between the build- ings on the Athenian Acropolis and the Attic land-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 279 scape: Figs. 34-37, 342, and 346. Our attention is not invited to the striking and dominant features of central Attica such as the pyramidal peak of Mount Pentelikon or the bold mass of Mount Lykabettos. We are asked to believe that the great buildings were laid out in axial alignment with two insignificant knobs on the crest of Mount Hymettos in combination with a rounded knoll that through most hours of the day is barely distinguishable against the main mass of the mountain. This situation is typical. Equally disturbing to confidence in the author's basic hypothesis is the fact that his assumption of an ancient Greek belief in the anthropomorphic symbol- ism of the conical mound and the horned mountain is based on conjecture from parallels, in themselves far from convincing, with Palaeolithic and Egyptian art. Not a shred of solid evidence is adduced from Greek sources either archaeological or literary. Apart, however, from the question of whether or not such natural formations had any symbolic value in the minds of the Greeks, the author quotes no ancient literary evidence that would even suggest that distant natural features were taken into account in the orientation of temples. There is abundant evidence, of course, both literary and archaeological, for a predilec- tion for physical settings of a special sort on the part of certain divinities. Sanctuaries of Poseidon, for in- stance, occur commonly on sea-girt promontories, temples of Athena on acropoleis. In these cases, how- ever, the choice of site was based on what one might call simple professional considerations, Poseidon being god of the sea, Athena protectress of cities. For the same reason statues of Hermes were frequently set up in market places, figures of Herakles in gymnasia, while at Athens the Temple of Hephaistos stood in the middle of the metal-working district. The relevant Greek and Roman authors are in fact quite explicit as to the principles on which temples were sited. Plato in the Laws prescribes for his ideal state, starting with the city. "The city should be placed as nearly as possible in the center of the country; . . . Then we will divide the city into twelve portions, first founding temples to Hestia, to Zeus and to Athene, in a spot which we will call the Acropolis, and surround it with a circular wall, making the division of the en- tire city and country radiate from this point." (v, 745; trans. Jowett) "The temples (i.e. of the gods other than Hestia, Zeus and Athene) are to be placed all round the Agora, and the whole city built on the heights in a circle, for the sake of defense and for the sake of purity. Near the temples are to be placed build- ings for the magistrates and the courts of law; and the places will be regarded as most holy, partly be- cause they have to do with holy things, and partly be- cause they are the dwelling-places of holy gods." (vI, 778; trans. Jowett) The arrangement for the twelve satellite settlements was similar. ". . . in each hamlet they shall first set apart a market-place, and the temples of the gods, and of their attendant demigods; . . But Hestia, and Zeus, and Athene will have temples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of the twelve districts. And the first erection of houses shall be around these temples, where the ground is highest, in order to provide the safest and most de- fensible place of retreat for the gods." (viii, 848; trans. Jowett) Similar considerations underlie Aristotle's recom- mendation for the placing of temples in his ideal state. "The principal common tables of the magistrates may be associated with the buildings devoted to public wor- ship, on some convenient and common site (except for such temples as are required by Law, or by a rule of the Delphic oracle, to be kept distinct and separate). This site should be on an eminence, conspicuous enough for men to look up and see goodness enthroned, and strong enough to command the adjacent quarters of the city. Below this site provision should be made for a public square." (vIr, 12, 2-3; trans. Baker) The pragmatic nature of Aristotle's thinking about such matters is revealed also in the section of the Poli- tics on the choice of a town site. "The city of our state, as we have already noticed, should be, as far as circumstances permit, a common center, linked to the sea as well as the land, and equally linked to the whole of the territory. Internally, and in its own lay- out, we ought to plan the ideal of our city with an eye to four considerations. The first, as being the most indispensable, is health. Cities which slope toward the east, and are exposed to the winds which flow from that quarter, are the healthiest: the next best aspect, which is healthy in the winter season, is one sheltered from the north wind (and therefore facing south). Two other considerations to be borne in mind are matters of the city's convenience for political and military activities. For the purpose of military activities it should be easy of egress for its inhabitants, but difficult to approach or blockade for any enemies. It should also have, if possible, a natural supply of waters and streams. . . ." (vII, I I, 1-3; trans. Baker) There is no reason to doubt that in this as in so many other respects the ideal prescriptions of Plato and Aristotle closely reflect contemporary practice, especially that of Athens. The factors governing the location of the temples, according to these authors, were of a very practical sort: the temples should be conveniently close to the center of civic life; they should be so placed as to exercise some religious re- straint on the conduct of public affairs; the more im- portant should be set where they would be most clearly visible and safest. Vitruvius, writing some three centuries later, had if anything a still more pragmatic approach. "For temples there shall be chosen the most healthy sites with suitable springs." (1, 2, 7; trans. Granger) "But for sacred buildings of the gods under whose protection the city most seems to be, both for Jupiter and Juno and Minerva, the sites are to be distributed on the highest ground from which the most of the</page><page sequence="4">280 THE ART BULLETIN ramparts is to be seen. To Mercury, however, in the forum, or also, as to Isis and Serapis, in the business quarter; to Apollo and Father Bacchus against the theatre; to Hercules, in cities which have no gymnasia nor amphitheatres, at the circus; to Mars outside the walls but in the parade ground; and also to Venus near the harbor." (I, 7, I; trans. Granger) Vitruvius' familiar recommendation for the orientation of temples may also be quoted once more. "The aspects which the sacred temples of the immortal gods ought to re- gard are so to be appointed (if no reason hinders, and the opportunity is presented) that the temple and the statue which is in the shrine look toward the western quarter of the sky, so that those who come to the altar to sacrifice or make offerings may look toward the eastern heaven and the image in the temple." (Iv, 5, I; trans. Granger) Another author whose testimony is to be taken seri- ously is Pausanias. Writing his description of Greece in the middle of the 2nd century A.D., he deals with hundreds of sanctuaries, the great majority of which he had certainly visited in person. Pausanias was a deeply religious man with a particular interest in the old sanctuaries of Greece. He was also a scholarly writer who supplemented the information which he picked up on the spot with research in earlier authors. Nowhere in his ten books does Pausanias betray knowl- edge of an intended relationship between a temple and distant features of the landscape. Had the principles of location and orientation enun- ciated by Scully really existed, especially if they had played a role of the importance claimed for them by Scully, one would be entitled to expect some reference to them in the authors of the Greek and Roman periods quoted above. But those authors, as we have seen, afford no support for the hypothesis. One may be forgiven, therefore, for suspecting that the hypothe- sis is the fabrication of a modern mind to suit a modern interpretation of a given set of ancient phenomena. In itself it has no more validity than the hypothetical principle of "dynamic symmetry" so much in vogue among scholars of the last generation. The hypothesis advanced by Scully, if confirmed, would raise a serious paradox in our interpretation of the ancient attitude toward nature. If Scully is right, we must assume that in one branch of architecture very great importance was attached by the Greeks to the natural setting of man's activities at a time when the same subject was receiving only the most summary attention from Greek writers, sculptors, and painters. If one may attach any weight to analogy, it is scarcely conceivable that such a principle as that enunciated by Scully should have been formulated before the Hellen- istic period, and the silence of subsequent authors both Greek and Roman make its existence even in later antiquity at best dubious.
