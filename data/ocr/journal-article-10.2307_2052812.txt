I found A little boat tied to a willow tree Within a rocky cave, its usual home. Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in Pushed from the shore. The Pr-elude, I850 edition O NE critic of Chinese poetry has written, suggestively: "Western readers are sometimes struck by what they do not find . . .".' One of the most familiar constituents of poetry, particularly of the lyric, that will not be found in much of Chinese nature poetry is an identifiable grammatical subject. It is not uncommon for a translator of Chinese poetry to ask ". . . who is its subject? I? You? She?" The requirements of the translation into Western languages suggest, of course, that a subject be supplied. Caught between syntactical correctness and the authority of the text, the translator is often forced to opt for fluency in the target language rather than fidelity to the source language. To be sure, this practice is of no great consequence in most instances. But, if we look at two excerpts, one from the Li Sao and the other from the T'ang shih san pai shou, and compare both text and translation, it becomes clear that there will be times when solmething other than mere linguistic convention is involved. t2T ' 'e 2 Having from birth this inward beauty, y + t A. ;x q&gt; k I added to it fair outward adornment: I dressed in selinea and shady angelica, And twined autumn orchids to make a garland. pg +i gt, L'/~ /) %v Swiftly I sped, as in fearful pursuit, (5) e1 g$ A A_ S Afraid Time would race on and leave me behind.

On the other hand, he has left implicit the "I" that begins the verse. There can be no objection to this practice, since the sense and mood of the original has been maintained. Now, if we turn to a poem by Liu Tsung-yiian, titled "Dwelling by a Stream" [ $ g ], we see a similar recurrence of the "I". 4 tIf X -4 e63 I had so long been troubled by official hat and robe g That I am glad to be an exile here in this wild southland.

A, (Bynner translation)3 Even the situation, the disaffected official seeking refuge in exile, healed in the presence of nature, is reminiscent of Ch'ii Yuan. But, a glance at the text shows that there is not one instance of a specified subject. Each occurrence of the "I" in the translation is supplied, each makes explicit what was implicit in the text. The effect is much more assertive, much more declarative than the effect of the original. The poem is an act of discovery, a touching account of Liu's initiation into nature. The agent in the poem is not the poet, not the "I", but the scene about him, and the action is one of admitting the poet into the life of the region described. The focus of the original is precisely opposite to what it is in the translation: it is not the "I" that dominates, but the scene. In the Ch'iu Yuan poem, the modulations of the "I" were in keeping with the self-oriented thrust of the imagery: there, nature was at the service of the poet. The objects he found in nature were at his disposal, to use according to his whim, whether as outward adornment, garland, or clothing: these trappings serve to enhance his "inward beauty." The Liu Tsung-yiian lyric is totally devoid of an explicit "I", but its absence is not incidental, but critical to the meaning of the poem.4 It is the purpose of this paper to analyze the ways by which Chinese poets refer to the "I", to examine the relevance of certain "images of self" to natture poetry in Chinese, and to compare the use of a specific image in nature poems with its occurrence in poems not directly or primarily about nature. As this concern is not strictly thematic, no attempt will be made to establish frequency of occurrence for any one image or set of images. The attempt will be to illuminate each poem by determing the presence, or absence, of images of self, and to suggest viable distinctions between intenselv personal nature poems on the one hand, and lyrics that merely use nature imagery on the other. 3 The lade Motuntain (New York, I972), pp. 98-99; CIh'iian T'ang Shih, 6 (I)/3/I2b. 4 The practice of omitting the "I" in Chinese lyric poetry has been discussed in a short notice by Hans Frankel, "The "I" in Chinese Lyric Poetry," Or icns io 0957), I28-I30; by Petcr Blood(berg, "Cedules from a Berkeley Workshop in Asiatic Philology," Ts'ing Htoa loturnal of Chinese Stuidies, vol. 7, no. 2 (August I969), pp. 9, 29-3I; S.

I passed from the womb . . . My father . . . the name he gave me . . ." The subject of the poem, and the grammatical subject of the sentences, is the first person singular. From this beginning the poem is a flight from the secular self, from its worldly entanglements and disappointments, into a realm which is not merely the lush landscape of the soutlhern regions, the Ch'u ( # ) country, but the fantasy world of the poet's imagination. Nature becomes a projection of the poet's beautiful and cultivated sensibility: LM * i ; ? g 5 In the mornings I drank the dew that fell from the magnolia; 8 t Xi X o7- '% * At evening ate the petals that dropped from $ iti 4-~ -t w&lt;.$ &lt; chrysanthemums.

Nature is useful: "I made a coat of lotus and water-chestnut leaves, / And gathered lotus petals to make myself a skirt." Nature is metaphorical: "Most people's likings and loathings are quite separate: / Only those men differ in this respect. / For they wear mugwort and cram their waistbands with it; / 5The disputes concerning the historical authen- ticity of Ch'ii Yuan, and the problems of dating him exactly, do not vitiate the intensely self-directed character of these lines. 6 Ch'tt Tz'tt, p. 22; SPTK, 1/3b-4b. 7 lbihi., p. 24; SPTK, I/h2b-I 3b.</page><page sequence="4">596 EUGENE EOYANG While the lovely valley orchids they say are not fit to wear." And, above all, nature is allegorical: "Pepper is all wagging tongue and lives only for slander; / And even stinking Dogwood seeks to fill a perfume bag. / Since they only seek advancement and labour for position, / What fragrance have they deserving ouir respect?" (lines i6o-i6I). Nature is seen alwvays in terms of something else: it is not described for itself, or experienced and enjoyed for its own sake. Because it does not accord with any external reality, it permits the poet a freedom of movement and invention that makes the imagination soar: t ; * , 4 R S I watered my dragon steeds at the Pool of Heaven And tied the reins up to the Fu-sang tree. 4* 4. i LX(4+ 8 5 I broke a sprig of the Jo-tree to strike the sun with: ,.~ it 1_1 Vk Aa I wanted to roam a little for enjoyment. %8 SL ;&amp; l/&amp; ^ + I sent Wang Shu ahead to ride before me; (5) jf 4Y e ~ Wk t 4 The Wind God went behind as my outrider; / A _ + The Bird of Heaven gave notice of my comings; ' L A Yt And the Thunder God told me when all was not ready. (Hawkes translation)8 .V 9 t ',4X This is not the real world of nature, but the world as the poet-in his fondest imaginings-would wish it to be. We respond not to the accuracy of the realistic detail but to the beauty of the image. And, we have no sense of localized place: in one line he is at the Ford of Heaven, in the next he is at the world's western end; he comes now to the Gobi Desert, and in a flash drives along toward the K'un-lun Mountains. The focus in the Li Sao is not on nature but on its counter- part-the secular world-from which the poet wishes release, and at which he directs his satire. If we turn from Ch'ii Yuan, who created a world in his poetry and painted a landscape of his mind, but tells us little of his daily routine, his actual life, and consider T'ao Yiian-ming, we notice a striking contrast. Where Ch'iu Yuan's poetry is exotically other-worldly, T'ao Yiian-ming's is charmingly of this world. Perhaps no poet has been more the favorite among Chinese poets than T'ao. Wang Wei, Su Tung-p'o, and Li Ch'ing-chao are three that come to mind who either admired his poetry or paid him the tribute of flattery by imitation. Aside from his tech- nical skill, there is something particularly appealing about the personality of T'ao Yiian-ming as expressed in his poems. One may sympathize with the intense emotion of Ch'ui Yuan, but the relentless lament of the Li Sao, beautiful though it may be, is wearing. "One begins to feel," David Hawkes has written, "that one is floating along on a river of tears with a high-pitched wail of self-pity ringing unendingly in one's ears."9 But T'ao Yuan-ming is perennially engaging: like a good guest, he is more likable with each visit. The subject of his poems is the world around him, his home, his family, his friends. He tells us a good deal about himself, yet few poets have been able to speak so much of themselves with so little trace of egocentricity. T'ao's effectiveness in this regard lies in his ability to make concrete the details of his own life so that we are able to sense the scene before 8 Ch'u Tz'u, p. 28; SPTK, I/28b-3oa.

Unlike Ch'ii Yuan, no emotional stance is inferred in the course of the words, and the "I" is much more subdued. The result is that the reader may enter the poem more freely, without having to decide between the "I" of the poet and his own "I." Thus, the implicitness of the "I" here assumes greater importance, and the effect of the poem is undermined when this implicitness is disregarded. Take, for example, T'ao's poem written on the occasion of his final retirement, "Returning to the Farm to Dwell": ?t '- i ti For long I left the joys of hills and lakes '-1&amp; ?f ik Deprived of the pleasures of woods and fields. 4( 4~, + Mt } Today I led my children and their cousins a 4 + aL 4S And made a path to a deserted town. &gt; ,se t rt We walked around among the grave mounds (5) K Al: x ,&lt; g And lingered by a dwelling from the past.

Other than that, the statement is uninsistent about the "I" even though the experience described is presumably the poet's. The effect of leaving out the subject in Chinese should not be equated with the passive voice in English: for the Chinese "Hold hands children and cousins" may not have the impersonality that characterizes "The hands of children and cousins are held" or "One holds the hands of children and cousins." The character of the Chinese language to make highly personal statements without specifying the grammatical subject, and to indicate very specific actions-in the active case-without identifying a syntactic agent, marks the uniquie potential of Chinese lyric poetry. There is no way for the translation, in supplying the "I?" not to sound more declarative than T'ao Yiian-ming in the original. In this poem, the two-part division of his philosophical nature poetry can be clearly seen. Ex- perience is described from the poet's life, not as his experience, emotionally colored as in Ch'ii Yuan, but as a sample af human experience, dispassionately transcribed. 10 James R. Hightower, The Poetr-y of T'ao Ch'ien (Oxford, 1970), p. 53; cf. T'ao Yiian-ming shsihs hsui-p'ing (Peking, I96I), p. 48, abbreviated hereafter as Hid p'ing.</page><page sequence="6">598 EUGENE EOYANG The transition to "just representations of general nature" is easily accommodated, for the syntax allows for the reading-without grammatical awkwardness-not only of a unique and idiosyncratic "I" but of a universal shared experience between poet and reader. The conclusion scarcely seems nagging philosophizing, for if we have read the poem, we have also experienced the corroboration for the conclusion. That this recession of the self frotn the poem in T'ao Yiian-ming was not totally inadvertent may be evidenced by one of his famous drinking poems, the often anthologized number I4 of the "Twenty Poems After Drinking Wine": +&lt; ,A t 4 * ~ Sympathetic friends who know my tastes Bring a wine jug when they come to visit. ~ jd ;^ +Sitting on the ground beneath the pine tree A few cups of wine make us drunk. _ Venerable elders gabbing all at once (5) And pouring from the bottle out of turn. * e Aware no more that our own "I" exists * t ;&lt; 7 How are we to value other things? 4$ Sk" 1b A - So rapt we are not sure of where we are- 40;4 f AtF '3' In wine there is a taste of profundity. '1' t :+ X ?(Hightower translation)"1 The profundity derives from a "higher perspective," achieved through wine, and indicated in the translation with the use of "we" in lines 8 and 9. But this pro- fundity requires the absence of the "I," or ignorance of the self, and we are pre- sented with a paradox which much occupied Buddhist logicians: how to deny ontologically the existence of something that is semantically asserted in the denying. To "obliterate" the self assumes that there is a self to obliterate, and the Lethean propensities of wine have been celebrated in many poems, as, for example, Li Po's "Drinking Along Under the Moon, No. 3" j j F 4 &amp;5 X - ], where the last two lines read: Not to know 7 X that my self exists- Of all my joys Vv A- This is the highest. (Acker translation) 12 The relation between wine and nature in Chinese poetry is itself an involved and fascinating topic, which one cannot consider here. But what nature and wine have in common, at least with respect to the self, is that both offer a form of escape. The flight first taken by Ch'iu Yuan from the self was futile because it was circular: the world it escaped to was controlled by the very agent of perception, the "I" of consciousness. Later poets would lose themselves in ways not nearly as solipsistic, and the two most popular diversions were wine and nature. The submerging of 11 The Poetry of T'ao Ch'ien, pp. 144-145; cf.

In contrast to the self-occupied, yet objective poetry of a T'ao Yiuan-ming, we may examine the highly egocentric nature poetry of his near contemporary, Hsieh Ling-yiin. "On Climbing Stone Drum Mountain Near Shang-shu" [ ? A Et- di I contains six lines of actual nature description preceded by eight lines of moody psychologizing, followed by the resolution in the last four lines expressing the feelings evoked by the scene. The end of the poem combines the psychologizing mood of the first part and the natural scene in the second part in one synthetic and surprising image. The striking absence of the self, of the word "I" in the text, does nothing to alter the strong focus of the poem on the first person.

These overtones may be seen in four places in the poem: line 2 recalls a line from the Ai Ying section of the Chiu Chang [ 'off ]: "It is now a long time since my heart has known happiness; / Grief comes following sorrow and sorrow following grief" t- s t4 A A * A * 4 - (Hawkes, p. 66; SPTK, 4/i6b); line 6 is a variant of a line from the Chao Hun [ 4 4fb ]: 13 J.

The kinship between this poem and the songs in the Ch'u Tz'u is strong. There, as here, nature is a refuge, a source of healing, and of refreshment. What was transport in the Ch'u Tz'u, however, is more moderate here, but the effect of nature of the poet is melioration and consolation. There are, nonethe- less, two critical differences: first, the natural scene in this poem, as least in lines 9-I4, is actual and not imaginary-the vistas are located in Shang-shu [ ?A A ], along the Yung-chia River [ Ak A '-S ]; second, unlike the Ch'u Tz'u poems, the text here, though equally preoccupied with personal experience, is totally devoid of any lexical reference to the self. The first two words mention "a traveller" [ 4e As ], and this may be taken to be the poet. But, he refers to himself not in the first person, but in the third. Contrast this with the instances of "I" in the Ch'u Tz'u. There the first person occurs frequently, but we do not see him objectively: we see what he sees through his eyes, and by inference feel we know what he is like, but we never see him as an object of perception. In Hsieh's poem, the "I" is ontologically vague, but referentially precise: we do not know if it is an "I" or "he" but we know his situation, and we can see him objectively ( t A,: he is traveller). In the Ch'u Tz'u, the "I" is ontologically precise, but referentially vague: we know it is an "I" and not a "he," but we do not see him objectively. Yet, in this setting, lovely as it is, the poet is alien: his melancholy does not disappear. On the contrary his loneliness is intensified. "Such a long road leading back to my old home . . . no one shares my pleasures," the poet muses, before he climbs alone, and "since no one shares my joys, / I shall find a scene to suit my melancholy." The paradox is so casually stated as to go almost unnoticed. Because there is no human to share his joys, he will find a scene to suit his melancholy. The joys of nature are no substitute for the pleasure of human companionship. For all nature's beauties, it is the absence of human company the poet feels most: "Not a trace of a friend to come and meet me here, / The distance only mocks my loneliness." Hsieh Ling-yiin's poems are still bound to human society. In how many does he conclude a rapturous description of the natural scene with a sense not of contentment, but of frustration. The poem written "On Making a Trip to the Southern Pavilion" [ i 4 S' ] concludes with the sentiment, "Who is there that can tell what I am saying? / Only my good friends understand my heart"; "On Climbing the Highest Peak of Stone Gate" [ It- l K 1at ] ends with "I only regret that there is no kindred soul, / To climb with me this ladder to the clouds in the blue"; in another poem, as he's following the Chin-chu rapids [ A ir r m,A kA 4 4 Aj ], he writes: "The sensitive heart will find beauty every- where- / But with whom can I discuss such subtleties now? / When I look at all this, the world of men disappears, / In a flash of enlightenment everything falls from me"; when he sets out from Kuei-lai and looks at the Twin Streams [k t E._ +t v ], he laments: ". . . it is not wind and rain that give me</page><page sequence="9">CHINESE NATURE POETRY 601 cause for regret, / But having no friend to whom I can pour out my heart." In all these poems, Hsieh makes the point that for all its endless fascinations, nature lacks the one attribute that human compansionship affords: emotional sympathy. Nature cannot listen, cannot share with understanding the sorrow and melancholy a man feels. The delights of nature leave the poet not much happier than before: it only reminds him acutely of his need for human camaraderie. One of the characteristics of Hsieh Ling-yiun's poetry is the very strong concern with the self, or with kindred selves, even when he leaves the "I" unstated. There is an encounter between nature and the self, and it is nature that is found wanting. Hsieh goes to nature for wisdom, and finds it cold. His philosophical interest in nature, and his distrust of analytical ways of comprehension, remind us of no poet more than Wordsworth. Both share the view that nature is an object lesson, from which one is to derive, if not comfort, then some form of truth. The attempt to put these lessons into words, to articulate the wisdom of nature characterizes much of Hsieh's poetry, as it characterizes Wordworth's. Where Hsieh writes a tract on the notion of "instantaneous enlightenment" [ At i ]* , Wordsworth can claim, against "meddling intellect": One impulse from the vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. "Come forth into the light of things," writes Wordsworth, "Let Nature be your teacher." "My inner feelings glow with contentment," Hsieh concludes in one poem, "Dragons and inch-worm are alike to me" [ tL .t ft m / oA Aspects of Self The examples from Hsieh Ling-yiun should dispel ally facile assumption that the omission of the first person necessarily indicates a self-effacing attitude in the poet. The strength of the sense of self, in the poem quoted, was no less strong for not being explicit. The implicit sense of the first person in a Chinese poem in no way diminishes its potential for self-assertion. There is, however, a third possibility to be considered. The absence of any referent to the "I" may not always be even im- plicit: the absence of the first person, or of any reference to the self, may reflect the very core of a poet's meaning-it may indicate the non-existence of self. The dif- ficulty in the statements by T'ao Yiian-ming and Li Po is that, in denying the reality of a concept, they semantically assert it. "Aware no more that our own 'I' exists," T'ao wrote, while Li claimed that the highest joy was "Not to know that my self exists-." The problem is that "the meddling intellect" affirms what the intuition refuses to recognize. We see, in fact, how much self there is in Hsieh Ling-yiun to overcome, and we're not surprised to find indications in Li Po's other poems of a very pronounced ego. The absence of self, not merely the implicitness, but the non-existence of the "I," is no more apparent (if that's the word) than in the poetry of Wang Wei.'4 Three of Wang Wei's most familiar lyrics will serve 14 Wai-lim Yip has discussed this point with ref- erence to translation in Ezra Potund's Cathay (Princeton, I969), pp. 67-69, and in Hiding in the Universe: Poems by Wang Wei (New York, I972), pp. v-xv.

In "Retreat Among the Bamboos" [ rfr i. fi ], the first word, "alone" [ % ] establishes the situation, much like the setting of many Hsieh Ling-yiun poems. The poet in nature sees what is described in the poem. But, unlike Hsieh, there is a sense of completeness and fulfillment at the end. I sit alone among dark bamboos, Strum the lute and unloose my voice. 7 ""' Grove so deep, no one knows. 4s 8 A fiF Xa The moon comes to shine upon me. 4 A t oW Sg (Yip translation)'5 There is no mention of loneliness or longing for the presence of humans. The first word dispassionately indicates the absence of anyone else. And whereas in Hsieh the sense was that there was no one to understand his feelings ("Not a trace of a friend to come and meet me here") here in Wang Wei, the statement is from just the opposite point of view: "Grove so deep, no one knows." It is the human con- sciousness that is alien, not the natural setting. In Hsieh, the implication was that nature did not understand or sympathize with man; in Wang, the point is that man does not understand nor sympathize with nature. The Yip translation has been forced to adopt the grammatical subject in the first sentence to accommodate English syntax, or else the line might have been translated "Alone, sit among dark bamboos"; and the "upon me" in the last line, "The moon comes to shine upon me," though undoubtedly tenable, is perhaps too explicit for hsiang chao, [ 48 . ]. The hsiang denotes an unspecified object of the verb chao, and if it were possible, one might have retained the ambiguity of what (or who) the object of the "shining upon" is, by translating the line as "The moon comes to shine upon . . ." But this is clearly misleading in English. There can be no question that there is a man in the scene, and he is playing the guitar and singing. But the thrust of the poem is to overcome these notions of human presence. It is the self that blocks-as it blocked Hsieh Ling- yiin-free access into nature. And it is the self that Wang Wei excludes from the poem. The "I" is neither explicit nor implicit in the poem: it is absent. In "Deer Enclosure" [ A , ], this absence not only of self but of any human presence is stressed almost to the point of redundancy in the first line: '1*. sit ;; I K Empty mountain: no man is seen ,-3 ~fBetF 3But voices of men are heard, Sun's reflection reaches into the woods i , 4* And shines upon the green moss. ais , (Yip translation)16 Here, for the phrase fu chao, contrary to his practice with hsiang chao in the previous poem, Yip avoids the insertion of the self in the objective case.'7 In the previous 15 Wai-lim Yip, Hiding in the Universe, p.

The first two lines seem contradictory: the mountain is empty, yet the poet adds no one is to be seen." The explanation makes clear what the mountain is empty of: from the succeeding lines, it is obvious that the mountain is not desolate, empty of activity, or of life. "Empty" refers specifically to human presences (there are, of course, Buddhist overtones to the word "empty"). Wai-lim Yip has written of the quietness of Wang Wei's poetry."8 I would stress the fact that it is more depopulated than quiet. There are sounds, but the sounds are those of nature, not loud or shrill, unlike the babble of human discourse. Yet, the poem says, "But voices of men are heard": if no human is to be seen on this empty mountain, whence these "human" sounds? To read the line as indicating human presences capriciously hiding, or merely not visible, would reduce the poem to bathetic triviality. It is clear that the answer is encompassed in the last two lines, which both resolves the puzzle and completes the meaning. For the mere indication of phenomena "speaks" to the poet: he understands. Having emptied the poem of the self, the "I" becomes phenomenon itself, on a par with the other phenomena in nature and able to comprehend its "voices." The meaning in the last two lines is totally unyielding: there is no moral, no intellectualizing. Pure phenomena speaks in the poem, and "the poet," as Yip has said, "having become Phenomenon itself." The underlying Buddhist notions in Wang Wei are well known and need not occupy us here. What concerns us is how many of his "philosophical" poems- "Answering Vice-Prefect Chang [ t ik Y; ,t ], "Mount Chung-nan" [ t.k 4 dI ], "Retreat at Chung-nan" [ 4 * %, ] conclude without a conclusion. The poem "Answering Vice-Prefect Chang" will serve as an example. The first part is ruminative, philosophical, inquiring about the meaning of life, and it ends with an almost desultory return to the woods. The second part, all but the penultimate of the four lines is an indication of phenomenon, and there is no attention to the reaction of the poet. If we recall how many of Hsieh Ling-yuin's poems ended with a description of his feelings, we can appreciate the spareness and the restraint of these lines. One almost never knows Wang Wei's reaction: the object of focus is resolutely the phenomenon before his eyes. With Hsieh, the abstract emotions are more real and more urgent than the scene; Wang, on the other hand, is impenetrable: he never tells us what he is thinking. We see him, if at all, as part of the scene. St, : 1i -44- -*e In later life quietude my only care. X X 7F 3 ,q,. A million affairs, none my concern.

The questions exist: they come from an unidentified but explicit "You" [ g ]. The "I" in the poem is passive: and the key line is the fifth: "Pine winds blow-my girdle is loosened." The poet exists in nature, and is affected by the slightest shift. In response to the pine breeze, the sash (Yip's "girdle") comes loose. But it would be inept to translate this line as "The pine-breezes blow loose my sash," for Wang Wei resists causal explanations of phenomena, which tend to replace themselves for phenomena themselves. The syntax, furthermore, indicates a harmony without inferring causality. "Pine-winds blow: my girdle is loosed / Mountain moon shines: I strum my lute." The parallel couplets were never used with such philosophic force. For they establish the relation- ship between phenomena: not one of contingency but one of harmony. The lines are "concrete": they act out the message the poet is trying to create. The Solitary Boat Our explorations into the references to the self in Chinese poetry have gone beyond vagaries of translation, and differences in language, to more focused under- standing of the poems. We have seen the use of the explicit first person (Ch'ui Yuan); we have examined the use of the implicit first person, even in poetry oriented toward the self (Hsieh Ling-yiin); and we have analyzed the "absent self"-or the self abnegated-in poetry that suggests a merging of self with nature (Wang Wei). Though he is perhaps more an autobiographical than a nature poet, the figure of Tu Fu is essential to our discussion, for he exemplifies the T'ang practice of writing poetry in which the conflict between self and the world of nature is often resolved. Tu Fu's achievement lies in creating a poetry that is at once intensely personal and intensely sympathetic and accessible. In Hans Frankel's words, the problem that faces the lyric poet, which Tu Fu solves decisively, is how "to find the proper balance between individuality and universality."20 If we examine Tu Fu's nostalgic "Moonlit Night," we may see clearly his char- acteristic use of images of self. After referring to his wife with the phrase kuei chung [ M9 t ], "the-one-in-the-women's-apartment" (cf. modern nei jen [ 'PA ]), Tu Fu adopts a phrase for himself which is both a locative and a metonymy: "Not yet understand to remember [their father being in] Ch'ang-an" X A'h t4- V 4 In another poem, the familiar "Spring Prospect" [ 4 t ], the last lines include a topos in Chinese poetry: "White hair scratch, still shorter / Hardly enough left to comb" X ie. k&amp; . 4 / 1 . The reference to the "I" is at a remove, the "I" is seen by the poet and objectified in the scene.21 These images are too commonplace to be organic metaphors, yet they haven't been fixed in the language as conventions. They may perhaps best be designated as "surrogate-images" for the self. In the first line of the Hsieh Ling-yuin poem we examined, we encoun- tered "the traveller"; other references include "guest"22, "the old man of the moun- 20 "The 'I' in Chinese Lyric Poetry," Oriens IO (I957), I28. 21 "The implicit "we" is the only solution to the problem in Tu Fu's much disputed poem to Li Po (' " : X ) that begins 4* * 49 Al.

William Hung, Tu Fu: China's Great- est Poet (New York, I952), pp. 37-38, and Peter Boodberg, Ts'ing Htia loturnal of Chinese Studies, vol. 7, no. 2 (August I969), pp. 33-34. 22 Actually, "guest" may be too limited: "wan- derer" is too aimless and footloose; "exile" too strong; and "sojourner" too formal. The sense is of someone abroad.</page><page sequence="13">CHINESE NATURE POETRY 605 tain"; "the old man of the wilds", "the wanderer", "the one who grieves". These are recurrent surrogates for the self: they refer to some aspect of the poet's situation, his feelings, or his condition. They permit the poet to treat the self with as much objectivity as the outside world. And they also have the effect of defining or limit- ing the self, giving it the contours that the first person singular by itself couldn't convey. An attempt to combine both the first person singular and the surrogate as object-in-scene would be totally contorted and unnatural. The topoi for the self would be bathed in sententious self-importance: "I, the traveller," "I, the guest," "I, the man of the mountain," "I, the old man of the wilds." The effect would be grotesque, unless one were depicting Caesarian habits of an egotist referring to himself in the third person. In the more common surrogate-images, convention and context make clear who the poet is referring to. But there are surrogate-images where the identification is not so clear or unarguable. The solitary goose, for example, is a favorite image, and figures prominently in many poems, including those written by Tu Fu, Ts'uei T'u [ a A1 1, and Liu Ch'ang-ch'ing [ V-1 t 9Xk ].23 It would be a disservice to suggest that an image like the solitary goose must always indicate an I-oriented poem: there may be occasions when it is merely a detail of the background. Still, the recurrence of an image might suggest something more than the incidence in nature of a particular phenomenon. In certain poems, an image attracts, more than others, the sympathy of the poet and allows him the latitude of speaking, without any indiscretion or "egotistical sublimity," of his own feelings. These images are not mere designations, as with conventional surrogate-images, but are more suggestive and metaphoric. Though they occur with frequency in T'ang poetry, they have not acquired the fixity of topoi and are not used in commonplace ways: each poet discovers the image anew, and informs it with his own meaning. There are many such images, and one thinks of such examples as "solitary island," "lonely mountain," "deserted city," "solitary crane," "lonely cloud," but the two images of self I should like to examine are "the solitary boat" I K 4 ] and "the empty boat" [ , 4 ]. Before one traces the poetic uses of "boat" images in Chinese poetry, one should recognize at the outset the inevitability of boats in the poetry of a country where the rivers form the major means of transportation, and are a setting for countless part- ing poems. What interests us here is not the statistical incidence of boat images, but rather the different uses to which the image is put. The paradigmatic source for the image of the empty boat is from the section "Mountain Trees" from the Chuang-tzu.24 It is almost an exact description of the confrontation between the "I" of the reader of lyric poetry and the "I" of the lyric poet. Here is the passage, in Burton Watson's translation: If a man, having lashed two hulls together, is crossing a river, and an empty boat happens along and bumps into him, no matter how hot-tempered the man may be, he will not get angry. But if there should be someone in the other boat, then he will shout out to haul this way or veer that. If his first shout is unheeded, he will shout again, and if that is not heard, he will shout a third time, this time with a torrent of curses following. In the first instance, he wasn't angry; now in the second he is. Earlier he faced emptiness, now he faces occupancy. If a man could 23 See Ch'iian T'ang Shih, 3(4)/i6/I4b, io(6)/ I/5b, and 3(I)/I/I2b-I3a. 24 SStl-ptu pei-yao, 7/Iob. Hereafter cited as SPPY.</page><page sequence="14">606 EUGENE EOYANG succeed in making himself empty, and in that way wander through the world, then who could do him harm?25 The anecdote clearly indicates in parable form the concern with the self, the "oc- cupancy" ( A - A -. ) of the boat. And it underlines the effect of a "self" in the other boat on the self. The anecdote makes plain that it is not the action of being bumped that causes anger, for an "empty boat" causes no irritation even in a "hot-tempered man," but rather the confrontation with another ego, when the occupant in the other vessel is encountered. In a second passage from Chuang-tzu, the image of the empty boat is compared to the man of no ability, and contrasted with false wisdom, the posturings of the so-called intelligent: These men you wander around with-none will give you any good advice. All they have are petty words, the kind that poison a man. No one understands, no one comprehends-so who can give any help to anyone else? The clever man wears himself out, the wise man worries. But the man of no ability has nothing he seeks. He eats his fill and wanders idly about. Drifting like an unmoored boat, emptily and idly he wanders along.26 The unpretentiousness of the "man of no ability" is preferred to the futile wisdom, "the petty words," of the clever and the wise. The unmoored boat, wandering along, is presented as a model of behavior. These two senses of "the empty boat" lie behind the poem T'ao Yiian-ming wrote on "the first day of the fifth month to match a poem by Secretary Tai': ~4 A6 6itL &amp; 0 It is an empty boat, cast adrift 0J A.

The metaphor is never made explicit, though the parallel of the back-and-forth motion of the boat, and the up-and-down course of man's life makes the relationship clear enough. The boat is not described, but merely alluded to, and the circumstances of composition indicate an abstract creation with no actual setting being depicted. The poem is a virtual comment on a text. Although there is some dispute as to what the empty boat represents,28 the structure would appear to be decisive in clarifying the use of the image. The first half of the poem (lines i-8) relates to events and phenomena without reference to human experience, and the second half (lines 9-I6) applies the moral derived from the phenomena described in the first half to human life. The example of natural phenomena, the endless drift of the empty boat, the ephemerality of time, the changes of weather, the cycles of sun and moon-these are outlined in the first part of the poem. There is no mention of man. But in the second half, the focus is exclusively on human affairs, beginning with the word shu in line nine, continuing with jen in line ten, chii in line eleven, kung in line twelve. The last four lines are addressed to humans. The implicit suggestion is that man should imitate the actions of nature and live in harmony with the rhythms of change and alternation evidenced in the phenomena described in the first half of the poem. The lines "Accept your lot and wait until it's over" and "Accord with change, whatever its ups and downs- / Follow your bent, no matter the heights and depths," is precisely the message conveyed in the second passage cited from the Chuang-tzu. The moral is, like the unmoored boat, drift along with the changes, follow the shifts of season, accept the flow of life, with- out striving-and you won't be in disharmony. The same theme is taken up by Hsieh Ling-yiun in "A Journey to Red Rocks, I Sail Out on the Sea" [ A 1 z Ai t1 e- 1, but there the situation is real, and the philosophical conclusion arises naturally out of the immediate moment. The locale is explicit. The "Red Rocks" lie between Yung-chia [ A ] and Jui-an r aX t ] districts in Chekiang province.29 The time of year is specified. It is the beginning of the summer, and the blossoms have not yet fallen. The scene is over- whelming: "I've seen enough; the sea-coast wearies me, / I shudder to think what an ocean voyage would do!" So, retreating from the actual voyage, Hsieh turns in- ward, and journeys in the "light boat" r A i ] of his imagination. The mytho- logical world of the "River Lord" and the "Earl of the Waters" beckons, and the middle six lines establish a world that is reminiscent of Ch'ii Yuan and the Li Sao: "I hoist my sail to go off gathering rock-flowers, / And haul up the matting on a trip for window-shells." And the middle section ends with a reference which is totally imagined, and bears no resemblance to the boat in which the poet presumably spent the night. Here is the poem: m t. 4J1 A 4 When the summer begins, the weather is still quite cool, X 1. 4 And the fragrant plants have not yet withered away.

The first part sets the immediate scene, and may be taken as actual description; the second elaborates a world hard to verify in reality, which may be called speculative; the third and last part involves three allusions taken from human history, from which the final moral is taken. The three parts of the poem may be seen as a progression from objective description of actual phenomena to subjective description of contemplated activity, ending with didactic citations from human history. The poem is, in the end, an exhortation, of self to self, to abjure worldly ambitions and to seek the freedom from self-centered- ness represented by the "empty boat". This tension is characteristic of Hsieh Ling- yiin: there is a reluctance to be persuaded combined with a need to be convinced. His poems are constant struggles to conquer the passions of the self. They are at- tempts, through meditation and intuition, to overcome "the viperous dragon" (in Wang Wei's phrase). These attempts are not uniformly successful, and we have poems that end in a disturbed, unsettled mood, as well as those that conclude on a note of resolution and tranquility.31 The third section begins in line 13 with a reference to Lu Chung-lien t 4ip who saved the city of Han-tan in the third century B.

He is contrasted with Prince Mou of Wei who found that "It was more difficult for him to retire and live among the cliffs and caves than for an ordinary person. Although he did not attain the Way, we may say that he had the will to do so."`3 The anecdote, however, involves more than two different reactions to worldly self-importance, and deserves a closer look. Prince Mou of Wei, who was living in Chung-shan, said to Chan-tzu, "My body is here beside these rivers and seas, but my mind is still back there beside the palace towers of Wei. What should I do about it?" "Attach more importance to life!" said Chan-tzu. "He who regards life as important will think lightly of material gain." "I know that's what I should do," said Prince Mou. "But I can't overcome my my inclinations." "If you can't overcome your inclinations, then follow them!" said Chan-tzu. "But won't that do harm to the spirit?" "If you can't overcome your inclinations and yet you try to force yourself not to follow them, this is to do a double injury to yourself. Men who do such double injury to themselves are never found in the ranks of the long-lived!" (Watson translation)33 The phrase used by Watson, "my inclinations" (Giles uses "natural bent"), loses the direct force of the scene, since Chan-tzu's advice is that one should either overcome the self or let the self go. The moral is that one should, like the light boat skimming over the ocean, overcome or yield to the self. Hsieh has precisely this anecdote from the Chuang-tzu in mind, for it provides him with his last line. In the story, Prince Mou has been told that if he doesn't either overcome the self or let it go, he will be doing double injury, and his life will be short. Hsieh heeds the advice-"Let me but think of the words of T'ai-kung Jen and then I shall manage not to die before my time"-hoping thereby to insure a normal life span. The allusion to T'ai-kung Jen also comes from the Chuang-tzu, and from the same chapter as the first passage in which we encountered the empty boat-alluded to in line 12 of the poem.34 T'ai kung Jen's words are: "The straight-trunked tree is the first to be felled; the well of sweet water is the first to run dry. And you, now-you show off your wisdom in order to astound the ignorant, work at your good conduct in order to distinguish yourself from the dis- reputable, going around bright and shining as though you were carrying the sun and moon in your hand! That's why you can't escape!" (Watson translation)35 The sense and tone of this excerpt reminds one of the second passage from the Chuang-tzu on the empty boat, in which reference was made to the "petty words" of the wise: "The clever man wears himself out, the wise man worries." Hsieh's use 32 Cf. Shih Chi, 83/I-ga, Frodsham, vol. ii, pp. 105, 133. 33 Complete Works of Chuang-tztu, pp. 3I7-3I8; SPPY, 9/i4b. 34 Chuang-tzu, SPPY, 7/Iia. Frodsham (The AMIurmuring Stream, vol. ii, p. I333) is convinced that the empty boat does not refer to the Chuang- tzu passage, even though Hsieh's reference to T'ai-kung Jen occurs almost immediately after the passage on the two boats crossing the river. 35 Complete Works of Chltang-tztn, pp. 2I3-2I4; SPPY, 7/iIb.</page><page sequence="18">610 EUGENE EOYANG of allusion and his reference to T'ai-kung Jen associates it by context with the first "empty boat" passage in the Chuang-tzu, and the meaning of the anecdote is reminiscent of the second. The first focuses on the existence of ego, and its effect on another ego; the second attacks the egotism of the clever and the wise. Both allusions are reinforced in Hsieh's poem, just as the anecdotes contrasting the behavior of Lu Chung-lien and Prince Mou further exemplify the concern with the self. It is the mark of the best use of allusion in Chinese poetry, that source texts are not merely recalled, but are recreated in the mind of the reader so that the lines may achieve their full nuance. The allusion is a context in which the lines achieve their meaning, and only complete familiarity with the source text will yield the full force of the poetry. The best use of allusion is always organic and complex: one must see how the poet plays on the source to advance his meaning. The poem by Hsieh, though it begins with an account of actual experience in the first six lines, develops into an abstract elaboration on an image in the next six: there is a description of the scene, which suggests an image to the poet, and the image conjures up historical models, alluded to in the last six lines. The process is one of observation, identification, and verification. The emphasis is not yet on nature, but on the lessons one can draw from nature. The thrust of the poem is away from phenomena to meaning. And the meaning, as the poem proceeds, relates more and more to the human dimension, until final verification comes, not from natural events, but from human history. The poem is, in Wallace Stevens's phrase, "a poem of the act of the mind." In the nature poetry of the T'ang period, the image of the "empty boat" will be joined by a cognate image, the image of the "solitary boat." The differences between the two are instructive. In the Chuang-tzu, passages, the "empty boats" involved one or two boats crossing a river (the "Mountain Trees" section), or one unmoored boat (the "Lieh Yii-k'ou section). The "solitary boat" involves the notion of one, lonely, orphan boat, often occupied rather than empty. It is the "solitary boat" that becomes familiar in T'ang landscapes and T'ang poems. Tu Fu, for example, favors the "solitary boat" to the "empty boat" (though he writes one joyous poem concluding with the image of the "empty boat") 36 In this preference there is something more than just poetic fashion at work. In the poems using the image of the "empty boat" we've examined, the effect has been allusive, philosophical, metaphorical. The image suggests itself for its poetic possibilities, and the poems have shown that these possibilities were well-explored. But the "empty boat" was not nearly as ubiquitous as the "solitary boat" and much more difficult to incorporate into the natural scene. It was, after all, an idea, a mental construct, rather than a familiar naturalistic detail. As the T'ang poet encountered the sight of single boats in the landscape, he incor- porated the image into the scene in his poems. Nothing shows the emergence of the image in the poetic landscape better than Wang Wei's "Ascending a Tower at a Town in Hopei" [ fI e s ) ]: 4 e ih g E A small village upon the Fu Cliff Travellers' bower among cloud-mists. -' - | * Eg Tall city to view the sundown. 36 "On the House of Hermit Chang", Chiu chia chi chu Tu shih (Harvard Sinological Series), 27I/I4.

The rest of the poem is objective description, and the "lone boat" is part of the scene, not only a metaphor in the mind. The "mind" and "wide river" lie on the same plane of reality, and both may be described as being "at leisure" without disjunction. The concreteness of the image of a boat by itself, familiar and recognizable in actual experience, commended the "solitary boat" to the T'ang poets. By contrast, the "empty boat", evocative as it was for T'ao Ytian-ming and Hsieh Ling-yun, was- because of its metaphysical propensities-more of a studio image, which smacked more of pen and ink than of mountain and hills. The T'ang poets preferred to these abstract constructions of noumenal ambience concrete creations of phenomenal ex- perience. And the image of "empty" in this context becomes less usable, for it requires too close, too solipsistic a perspective. There is no way of determining whether a boat is really empty except by being very near it. The anecdote from Chuang-tzu hinged on precisely the question of whether the boat was empty or not empty. Our reactions to the boat that collides with us depends on our presumptions as to the occupancy of the boat. We have to look in the boat to see if it's empty. But the difference be- tween the empty boat and the solitary boat is a difference in perspective: the one requires a close-up view, the other puts the viewer at a distance. The characterization of the boat as "solitary" comments on its relationship to the surroundings: it looks "orphaned," "alone," "lonely," in the landscape. Ku chou immediately evokes the setting, whereas hsii chou directs the attention to the boat itself. It is this "com- patibility" with the natural scene that attracted T'ang poets to the "solitary boat," and made it a favorite with a major figure like Tu Fu as well as with a lesser poet like Liu Ch'ang-ch'ing. Meng Hao-jan, whose poetry abounds with boats going here and there, has one poem with the "solitary boat," and it clearly marks the identifica- tion of poet with image. The poem is written to a friend, as Meng finds himself away from home, in a boat moored on the T'ung-lu River: &amp; A i Mountain dark: hear the monkeys wailing, Wide river rushes through the night: Wind whistles in the trees on both banks, A ' - 4 Moon shines down on one lonely boat. t- vQ 0&gt; A - i Chien-te is not my land, (5) $t 4; tt.

Unless identi- fied, translation is mine.</page><page sequence="20">612 EUGENE EOYANG The poem is on a familiar theme: we have encountered it in the poem by Tu Fu. The first four lines are objective description: the poet indicates the moment, the place, and the events. He does not say at the end whether the lonely boat is his, or whether he is in it-though that can be easily surmised. But there is nothing to disrupt the scene: in the natural setting, the eye sees the dark, the ears hear the sound of monkeys, the skin feels the coolness of the river currents. The last line of the first part takes the reader's eye, almost like a spotlight, to the lonely boat. The scene is not so much delineated as indicated: the poet does not intrude. The second part turns to the poet's own feelings. The "spontaneous overflow of emotion" has been prepared for, it has been introduced by a description of the natural setting. The emotion implicit in the first part is expressed in the second. And the final lines, associating tears and the sea, is an apt conjunction of personal emotion with natural phenomena. The water of human tears and the waters of the rivers and seas are one, just as in Wang Wei's mind and wide river were one. The key image in the poem, occupying the center and the pivot, is the "one lonely boat": it is both part of the objective scene and the vessel of subjective feeling. The perspective in the first half of the poem is from without, in the second half from within. The reader is confronted with the two in their proper order, for had they been reversed, it would have been difficult to identify with the lyric I, and the indicated scene would have seemed superfluous. The strategy has been to involve the reader unequivocally in the scene so that he may participate in the emotions the scene evokes. The "empty boat" is, in fact, occupied. The advantage of the "solitary boat" image is that it externalizes and objectifies the referent, so that the identification loses nothing in concreteness. The relation of the self to the boat is uninsistent, and we may view the scene without prejudice to the poet's sensibilities or our own. This implicit relation permits the poet a wide latitude, and in many parting poems, the image may represent the parting friend rather than the poet himself. The occurrence of related images, such as "lonely sail," is common- place.39 This reference of the image to other selves may be seen in the following poem by Liu Ch'ang-ch'ing: +k I1 ' l ik 4v Autumn river vast: water waves in vain ,jg t gk , Travellers to Yiieh, in the solitary boat, start a boatmen's song. + 44 t 4 Xct 4 iK I break off wilting willows, sorry that things must age: Old friends fall away, not many left now.4" Here, the "solitary boat" is identified metonymically with the parting friend, and the last image, particularly the phrase ling lo, which I translate as "fall away," is a graceful reference both to the wilting willows and to old friends. It is the metaphoric accommodation of both natural phenomena and human emotions within the same image that characterizes much of T'ang poetry, and which the "solitary boat" so often exemplifies. The image, because it is implied rather than explicit metaphor, is free, and admits references either to the self, as in the Meng Hao-jan poem, or to other selves, as in this poem. 39 The best-known example is perhaps Li Po's "Farewell to Meng I-lao-jan" where the thirdl linc reads: "A lonely sail, distant shade, extinguished by blue" [V\ ; A Af V.3 , t t]. 40 Ch'uan T'ang Shih, 3(1)/4/IIa.</page><page sequence="21">CHINESE NATURE POETRY 613 The "solitary boat" did not merely provide a convenient surrogate for the self: because of its connotations of "loneliness" it contained a potential that sometimes tended toward the symbolic, as can be seen in this otherwise desultory vers d'occa'sion by Liu Ch'ang-ch'ing: t X t kf f' 0t + ){ Once Again, Seeing Off P'ei Lang-chung, g 87 X "ki X S Sent Down to Chi-chou ks hEl g, *; At g Monkeys cry, you go off as dusk settles on the river, Men grow heartsick as waters flow; J1I IV i i t tt We're both banished, but you're sent further away- i 4 A u-_ j)i\N Green mountains, miles and miles, one lone boat.41 Here, in this chiieh-chii, there is a reference to "you" in every line but the last: k'o in line i, inclusively with jen in line 2, chiin in line 3. Instead of a personal reference, the last line ends with ku chou, "one lone boat." The line is a perfectly objective description of a natural scene: the boat, all by itself, wandering miles and miles down the river through green mountains. But the first three lines make clear that nature description is not the aim here. The poem is an expression of emotion, which, iron- ically enough, is most powerfully conveyed in the most concrete line of the poem. It is the ability, by use of metonyms and metaphors, to find the appropriate concrete, indicative image that enabled T'ang nature poets to find fullest expression of their feelings. It is clear that, as a result, T'ang nature poetry is charged with lyric emotion, but it is a lyricism more induced than discharged. The reader is supplied with the phenomenal details, and directed to sense the scene. From this sensuous apperception of the scene through words, an abstract emotion is elicited. Take, for example, the first line of the poem quoted, "Monkeys cry, you go off as dusk settles on the river." This is probably an accurate account of an event, but no one would deny the emotive force of "monkeys cry" and "dusk" settling on the river. The emotion is carried by this selection of naturalistic detail: the poet chooses the "objective correlative"-always within the parameters of the actual scene-of the emotion he wants to engage. In some instances, as with the Wang Wei poems, emotive words are left out of the poem; in others, as in these by Liu Ch'ang-ch'ing, the concrete description inter- mingles with a statement of feeling. One of the most beautiful "solitary boat" poems is not by Liu Ch'ang-ch'ing but by Liu Tsung-yiian, the famous "River Snow": the scene is vivid, yet the structure of the poem gives it an eerie metaphysical dimension, as if one were not dealing with a concrete picture, but its obverse. This quality is accentuated by the key placement of a negating word at the end of each line: + b ~ Mountain after mountain, birds fly off, disappear- g ifd tA. Miles and miles, human trails, erased- g&gt; $ ff 4 ~A solitary boat, rain-cloak and straw-hat, an old man Fishes alone on winter's river, as it snows.4- The syntax of the lines, pitting the first four words against the forceful negative thrust of the last words-in lines one and two, the lines end with annihilation, in 41 Chz'tian Tang S hih, 3(I)/4/Iia-b. 42 Ch'ian T'ang Shih, 6(i)/3/14a; cf.

The last word of each line suggest annihilation or extinction: "disappear," "erased," "old man," "snows." The figure of an old man, seen in outline and from a distance, on a solitary boat makes this desolate scene unforgettable, yet somehow not naturalistic. One senses that the poem is not about a specific moment, but about extinction in the abstract. The "solitary boat" lies near the center, but there is no need to attribute any identity to it, or to the old man: the poem is self-sufficient re- gardless of the metaphoric equation. It does not press us to see the "solitary boat" or "an old man" as "I," Liu Tsung-yiian. The scene described in the poem is pitiless, unsentimental: no word on the old man's condition, nor on his reasons for fishing on the river in the cold. If the first two lines implant in the reader's mind a certain pattern, of assertion followed by annihilation or extinction, then the last line assumes ominous force. Snow becomes more than a meteorological detail: it is now a meta- physical symbol of great abstractness and power. Liu Tsung-yuan's poem shows that concreteness and abstraction need not be mutually exclusive, and that, given a selec- tion of details manifest in their denotation and abstruse in their connotation, a poem may be successfully concrete and abstract at the same time. Another use of the "solitary boat" image neither conicrete nor abstract may be seen in Tu Fu's poem, "On Yueh-yang Tower" [ , M 4t ]: 3 I $ % 4tt I have heard of Lake Tung-t'ing- fi Q * ? Today I ascend the Yiieh-yang Tower. Wu and Chu, east and south, are split; FL Y&amp; a Mt ;+ Heaven and earth, day and night, float above. From friends and relatives, not a word: Old and sick I have a solitary boat. t $ n aiU 4 War-horses north of the mountain-pass, A\ , 0 L a * On the balcony, my tears flow.43 The remarkable thing about this much-admired poem is how little we see at the magnificent spot with a marvelous view. We see directions, "east and south," we see historical geography, "Wu and Ch'u," we see cosmology, "heaven and earth"-all abstractions that convey nothing of the prospect before a sightseer at Yiieh-yang Tower. Nothing about the actual place; no word about the time of day or season of the year; no description about lakes and mountains in the scene. Once on the tower, Tu Fu sees reflections of himself and of his melancholy. What he sees lies not in the foreground or even in the background, but in the mind's eye; "the war-horses north of the mountain-pass." Having specified the place, climbed the tower to enjoy the much-vaunted view, he indicates nothing about the vista before his eyes. And the phrase, "Old and sick, I have a solitary boat" is pure imagery and refers to nothing concrete. The image is one of loneliness-"from friends and rela- tives, not a word"-and the "solitary boat" exists only to express the poet's feelings. We see a tendency reminiscent of Hsieh Ling-yun, a tendency to prefer the company 43 Chiu chia chi chu Tti shih, 54I/35/4. Cf.

The difference is, where Hsieh at least allowed us a glimpse of what he saw, Tu Fu renders nothing of the actual setting. What marks the occasion, and makes it real, is the experience of the poet at the moment of the poem. The location of the Tower is incidental and of only anecdotal importance.44 The self is not projected to an object of perception: we "see" the prospect through the self. But my translation is misleading, for it makes the poem too definite with respect to the "I." The reference to the first person in lines I, 2, 6, and 8, are all sup- plied: no reference is made in the original. Here the implicit "I" is everywhete present, but the absence of a lexical "I" achieves a certain "lyric discretion," a way of speaking one's own thoughts and expressing one's own feeling without burdening the poem with more self-centeredness than it (or the reader) can bear. Other instances of the image in Tu Fu confirm this analysis of his use of the "solitary boat." Even when he is describing an actual journey on a ku chou, as in his poem to Magistrate Nieh of Lei-yang, he writes ". . . I have been travelling / On a solitary boat laden increasingly with melancholy, / Passing many places where dangers threatened" (Hung translation).4 The "solitary boat" is real, a matter of actual happenstance, but Tu Fu uses it metaphorically, as a vessel for the self. On an- other occasion he compares the "solitary boat" to "yesterday" ( a 4 XL. 0( B )4,6 and elsewhere, he writes that "the solitary boat pulls along his homestead heart" [ -l6.. A - it 1 '%' ]47 The "solitary boat" is obviously not part of the indicative moment, as it was in Wang Wei, Meng Hao-jan, and Liu Ch'ang- ch'ing; it is now part of the "subjunctive" scene in the poet's imagination. The de- scription is of inward feeling, not of outward form. In this internalization of nature (as opposed to the externalization of self in the nature poets), we see a tendency that will become the mainstream of Chinese poetry. Nature will be seen in human terms, not necessarily with anthropomorphism, but as somehow relating to human emo- tions, either sympathetic or indifferent to human concerns. The "discreetness" of the Chinese lyric poet, whether achieved through implicit- ness or through the use of surrogate-images, obviates the difficulty of the inherently posed stance of the lyric poet as one who does not address an audience but intends to be "overheard". The principle of "discretion" solves the problem of having to decide ingenuously on the one hand, that the lyric poet must represent real utterance, or ingeniously on the other, that there must be a persona or mask in the poem.48 The "Erlebnis" or "lived experience" need not be that of the poet, and the value of the poem does not have to depend on the verifiability of the sentiments expressed in the lyric, nor does it depend on such nebulous notions as "sincerity" or "authenticity". For "Erlebnis," with "lyric discretion," becomes objective, not subjective, and it is 44 I am making no evaluative judgment on the qualities of the two poems, but by the comparison merely want to clarify their radically (lifferent con- cerns. And, of course, the Tower does have his- torical and psychological importance for Tu Fu. Nor am I interested in "abstract" or "concrete" as a value: what these terms elucidate is the relation between the actual scene and the poem. In an "abstract" poem, the "scene" exists but in the mind; in a "concrete" poem, the scene exists in reality, in nature. It should be clear that poems nee(l not be exclusively one or the other. 45 Chll chia chi chu Tu shih, 256/20/I3; Wil- liam Hung, Tu Fu, p. 276. 46 Chitt chia, 245/6/3. 47 Chitt chia, 467/32a/6. 48See Rene Wellek and Austin Warren, Theory of Literature (New York, I949), p.

This would accommodate Rene Wellek's concern that any judgment on the "lived experience" of the poet obscures the "boundary between art and non-art," for the question now becomes what is the "lived experience" in the poem, not of the poet, still less (to avoid the "affective fallacy") of the reader. It is because Tu Fu is able to objectify his Erlebnis in poetic art that one can re-experience his poetry without necessary recourse to his life. The poems are successful because they are free of both reader and poet: the "self" is not occupied, the boat is "empty." The tradition of Chinese poetry will follow the "subjunctive" mode of a Tu Fu rather than the "indicative" mode of a Wang Wei. The images of nature will be artificial in the t'zu, whether ornamental, as in Wen T'ing-yun's descriptions of painted screens, or playful, as in Yen Shu or Ouyang Hsil's puns on courtesans. The ku chou becomes more poetic conceit than naturalistic detail: it no longer exists as part of phenomena captured in poetry, but is more often a self-conscious image con- jured up by the poet. One tz'u by Ouyang Hsiu will serve to show this tendency: |8 I k . hX Alone I board the solitary boat, (4~ Le_ A Leaning against the mast, I exhaust my view. |t A * q Evening rain is slow to come, fl, tk tK And next morning, disappears. 2 P P , Unremitting cold, falling leaves pell-mell.

But the image is so common in tz'i` that is may also be a topos. The next lines, with their conglomerate images, suggest that motifs are being assembled with something other than verisimilitude in mind, for it is raininlg, it is dusk, it is morninlg, the niew mooni shines down, there is cold, and the leaves scatter. It would be idle to criticize the poem on this basis, since it makes no attempt at the consistenit indicationi of scene we encountered in the T'ang n.ature poets. Ouyan1g Hsiu is paintilng a landscape of emotion, and the two stanzas describe his wakinlg aind his dreaming states of minid. Where the first staniza is dotted with words of tensioni anid uncertainity (such as g h t in line onie, A A in line two, - x in line three, 49 Cl'iian Sting TW'ii, p. I56.</page><page sequence="25">CHINESE NATURE POETRY 617 and I' i-t in line six), the second stanza is emphatic and positive. Whereas the details of the actual scene are confused and contrived, the dream-scene is clear and realistic. The poem exists in the realm of wish, and the focus is on, not reality, but the willed scene. The writing is indicatively muddled, but subjunctively clear. We cannot see clearly the physical surroundings, but we do sense unmistakably the psy- chological mood. The dream state is more vivid than the waking state, and the effect of the poem is to speak of love and of longing without recourse to sentimental ab- stractions. The depth of emotion is measured by the clarity with which the poet de- scribes what, in his dream, he saw. And the verisimilitude of the dream stanza is not to actual phenomena but to subjunctive wish. It reflects faithfully not what the poet sees but what he feels. The focus of many tz'u poets is not the outside world but the inner emotions; rather than merely expressing these emotions in words that would distort them, the tz'u poets attempted to concretize in images the reality of their feelings. In this per- spective, the "I" looms very large.50 So when the "solitary boat" appears, it is usually a poetic trope for the "lonely I." The use of the image as trope, and not as descriptive detail, frees the poet to select whatever image will serve: he is no longer "bound" by the facts of phenomena. The hsui chou, the "empty boat," begins to reassert its appeal, and we have poems like the following from Lu Yu: !L -4a 4 4 * w :L -f_ 3? My life is like an empty boat Drifting forever ten thousand miles. Hating to end my days a wanderer, k f Everywhere I go I think of tieing up. *.t i )j I-. 'g By the side of the road, who lives here?

The first four lines are unabashed metaphor, not indicative observation, but it is followed by a strikingly detailed picture of a little bookish retreat, Huang Hsiu-ts'ai's study. The naturalistic detail is of anl interior, the sight of which prompts the last philosophical 50 Wang Kuo-wei has considered this question in his len-chien tz'tu-hia, edite(d by Hsi!

But the preference enunciated in the conclusion is not for an "empty boat" drifting in nature; the poet is attracted, instead, to an idyllic scholar's existence. How flexible the trope becomes, how removed from any concern for verisimilitude, may be seen in the subjunctive use of a boat image in Li Ch'ing-chao. The effect of contorting reality in order to accommodate intense emotion is virtually expres- sionistic: the reality it conforms to is within, in the soul, and not without, in observ- able nature. a at ,. , &amp; i Tune: Spring in Wuling the wind subsides, fragrance of petals freshly fallen * t X ~ @ '{$ 4 + it's late in the day-i'm too tired to comb my hair things remain, but he is gone and with him, everything on the verge of words: tears flow before speech M 4 i hear at Twin Creek spring is still lovely A; .

The first line is scenic in the manner of Wang Wei: the details of natural phenomena are outlined with spareness, shrewdly selected for their emotional content; the second line brings in a colloquial element that gives, if not physical, then psychological verisimilitude; the third line is pure abstraction, on an ontological level; and the first stanza ends with the fine discretion of "on the verge of words: tears flow before speech," a physiological correlative of emotion. In this amalgam of poetic styles, the key line is the third, which by itself would appear too cerebral for poetry, but here acquires a devastating force: "things remain, but he is gone and with him, everything." We have the physical setting in the first line, the psychological mood in the second, the philosophical situation in the third, and the physiological event in the last. This analysis would be an imposture if the lines did not have the vitality that survives anialysis. In the second staniza, the poet posits a natural scene: it is introduced disarmingly with the colloquial "i hear . . ." and the description to follow is a conjectural report, wish fulfillment. Aside from the senti- ment behind the description, the lines report a noni-evenit, something that might have happened, but didn't. The "lightsome skiff" is made even more fragile and now becomes a "frail 'grasshopper' boat" to prepare for the weight of the inexpres- sible grief with which the poem ends. The abstraction is made real by relating it to a subjunctively concrete image. We can picture the "frail 'grasshopper' boat"; we can imagine the wish to enjoy the scene at Twin Creek in a "lightsome skiff." Im- plicitly, the occupant of that boat in the second line is the poet, but the poem leaves the question undecided. The second line merely evinces a desire to float on a light boat at Twin Creek and to take in the pleasures of nature: but the wish-fulfillment picture is dashed by the reality, not of the actual moment, the fact that she is not 52 Chl'itan Sting Tz'ui, p. 93I.</page><page sequence="27">CHINESE NATURE POETRY 619 there, but of the heavy burden of her sorrow. The fragility of the "lightsome skiff" is exaggerated in proportion to the weight of the grief the poet feels. The poet's expres- siveness distorts the scene in order to allow for the intensity of feeling. The occupant of the "lightsome skiff"-unspecified previously-is now identified as, not the poet, but grief itself. Description is guided no longer by objective indicative fidelity to nature, but by subjective, subjunctive intensity. Conclusion We have traced in several poems the concern with the self and the ways by which Chinese poets express their lyric mood, both in poems about nature and poems that merely use nature imagery. I do not claim to have selected examples that are always representative of their period, or even of their authors. What I have tried to demon- strate is the fruitfulness of seeing through the I-image certain differences in poetic imagination. That many of the poems are among the best-known and most admired suggests that a concern with images of self may be related to central questions of evaluation and literary criticism. As epigraph to this paper, I quoted the famous lines from Wordsworth's The Prelude with one signal omission. It is time now to restore these words to the text and to consider the passage in light of our observations: "One summer evening (led by her) I found A little boat tied to a willow tree Within a rocky cove, its usual home. Straight I unloosed her chain, and skipping in Pushed from the shore." (Text of I850)5s3 The "her" referred to in parenthesis is "Nature"-a word, an abstratction, for which there is no exact equivalent in all the nature poems written in Chinese. It is another of those things that one does not find in Chinese poetry. The differences in attitude between Western and Chinese nature poets toward nature is a subject that has attracted some attention,54 but it lies outside the scope of this study. Our understand- ing of the relationship between poetry and landscape has been considerably advanced by studies of the "sister arts"55-though the difficulties of comparing two separate and distinct arts-with irreconcilable differences as well as undoubted similarities-some- what impede our progress. The attempt to elucidate the relationships between landscape and poetry, to ex- plore Western and Eastern traditions of nature poetry on a comparative basis, will 53The Prelude, edlited by Ernest de Selincourt; second e(lition, reviscel by Helen Darbishire (Ox- ford, 1959), pp. 23, 25. 54 See J.

But if these analyses are to contribute sig- nificantly to our understanding of each tradition, there must be more precision and rigor of method in dealing with the evidence. When we read such observations as the following: Meng Hao-jan . . . does not conceive of the natural scene as mere apparatus of the mind, as often seems to be the case with Wordsworth. Rather, he tends to see himself as part of the natural scene, looking at himself from the outside, as it were."56 there can be no objection from anyone familiar with the two traditions. But, at the same time, such cautions as "often seems the case," "he tends to see," inviting, as it were, our concurrence on the basis of sensibility, rather than soliticing our agreement on the basis of evidence, is disturbing. When we read, in a discussion of Buddhist land- scape poetry, "So the contemplation of landscape is the contemplation of Reality it- self,"57 we are entirely in accord, but we are also curious as to how this identity is achieved in demonstrable-if no less miraculous-ways. In effect, the philosophical concerns alluded to in Wordsworth's parenthetical phrase "(led by her)" are what I have excluded from my discussion, so that the analyses could restrict themselves to specific textual examples, and the concrete scenes captured in indicative nature poetry. But for the parenthesis, the lines quoted from Wordsworth's poem are totally indicative: they are not always so in the Prelude, which on occasion can become as abstract as a philosophical treatise. It is because the comparison between Eastern and Western modes of nature poetry suggests such tempting hypotheses-one might consider Western ways of personifying nature and Eastern ways of externalizing man-that a detailed, and textually responsible, method of examining these intimations must be used. I have not exhausted the texts that might serve the purpose: indeed, the success of this attempt will be determined by how productive the approach is with texts other than those I have chosen. In selecting the image of the "solitary boat," I have tried to look with some precision on otherwise diffuse notions as self, ego, identity, harmony of self with nature.58 In isolating the "indicative" and "subjunctive" modes of poetry, I have tried to avoid any tendency to make value judgments. My preoccupation has been Nwith T'ang nature poetry, where the indicative mode seems to predominate, but it should be clear, as the few examples from Sung tz'u show, that the "subjunctive" mode produces some excellent poems. Whether the "indicative" mode was peculiar to the T'ang period, and unique to Chinese poetry, lies outside my competence to judge. In our investigation of the inmage of the "solitary boat," I have tried to avoid sterile hunts for images, or to engage in efforts "trop arides et condamnees a l'errtdition pure." The image of the boat, whether "empty," "solitary," "light," or "small" haunted Chinese poets when they wrote about niature or about themselves.
