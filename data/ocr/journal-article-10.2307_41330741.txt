These outfits and the sangamento performance as a whole, I argue in this article, were visual manifestations of the elabo- rate symbolic and mythological manipulations that underlay the adoption of Christianity as the Kongo Kingdoms state religion. FIRST CONTACTS The Kingdom of Kongo was a highly centralized polity founded in the 1300s, according to oral histories and archeo- logical evidence.4 In west central Africa, it extended south of the Congo River through the western part of todays Demo- cratic Republic of the Congo and northern Angola. Its political organization was centered on the person of the king, who ruled with absolute power over large territories from his capital city by means of governors sent from his court to provincial towns. The regal function was not hereditary. Rather, a group of quali- fied electors chose the new king (called a mani) among a pool of eligible candidates. This system of transition rendered royal successions delicate political affairs and placed high value on the ability of the chosen king to assert his rule and establish his legitimacy in political, military, and supernatural terms. Kongo monarchs therefore depended heavily on a range of regalia, narratives, and ritual apparatus to demonstrate their power and naturalize their rule. The Kongo kingdom entered into European history in 1483 with the arrival in west central Africa of Portuguese explorers and clerics led by Diogo Cão, who were searching for a mari- time passage to India and for new converts to Christendom. In the first decade of contact, the realms of Kongo and Portu- gal exchanged groups of men to visit each other s courts as both guests and hostages, dispatched embassies, and established a cor- dial diplomatic relationship. The result of this early contact was the willing conversion of the Kongo monarch Nzinga a Nkuwu (r. 1470-1509), who celebrated his baptism with great pomp and a sangamento on May 3, 1491, taking the name of João I.5 The newly Christian king instigated large-scale reforms in his king- dom based on the technological, cultural, and religious knowl- edge that Portuguese emissaries and Kongo men returned from Europe had brought to his court. The changes initiated by João I blossomed under the leader- ship of his successor, Afonso I Mvemba a Nzinga (r. 1509-1542), who imposed Christianity as the kingdoms state religion and integrated it into the symbolic and historical fabric of the realm. The official adoption of the new faith was met with a mix of enthusiasm and opposition, but it soon prevailed and opened a new era in the history of west central Africa defined by its involvement in the commercial, political, and religious networks 52 african arts winter 201 1</page><page sequence="2">1 The Missionary Gives his Blessing to the Mani during Sangamento Bernardino d'Asti (Italy, ca. 1740) Watercolor on paper; 19.5cm x 28cm (7 W x 1 1 ") Biblioteca Civica Centrale, Turin, MS 457, fol. 18 PHOTO: © SETTORE SISTEMA BIBLIOTECARIO URBANO DELLA CITTÀ DI TORINO This watercolor, authored by a Capuchin friar veteran of the central African mission, offers a dynamic rendi- tion of the sangamento, a ritual martial performance staged in the early modern Kingdom of Kongo. of the early modern Christian Atlantic world. From this time to the nineteenth century, through centuries marked by pro- foundly transformative events such as civil and foreign wars and the traumatic population drain of the transatlantic slave trade, Christianity continued to play a prominent role in the shaping of political and religious life in the Kingdom of Kongo.6 Sangamentos were performed by people in various polities of west central Africa before and after the advent of Catholicism in the region. In the Kongo, as in neighboring kingdoms, such dances continued to be carried on in the Christian era, with slight yet significant changes in their nature, purpose, and form.7 Originally, sangamentos were held at the time of harvest and were the occasion for tribute payment. After the adoption of the new religion, the dances remained an occasion when political hierarchy was reinforced and enacted by tax collection and the ceremonial performance of allegiance, but such practices func- tioned within an altered symbolic realm. Sangamentos changed from being celebrations of prosperity and abundance linked to agricultural cycles to festivals related to the commemoration of a particular saints day, determined by the Christian liturgical cal- endar.8 During both periods, they also served as preparations for war and participated in the pageantry of diplomatic receptions (Thornton I99i:iii2).9 It is important to underline that Christianity developed in central Africa under the patronage of Portugal but at the com- mand of the Kongo kings themselves. The new religion conse- quently took on a particular form that is well documented, not only by written records but also by Christian objects created in the region, such as the characteristic brass crucifix mixing Kongo and Christian visual and symbolic syntax in Figure 2. Kongo crucifixes brought together local ideas of death and regeneration expressed by the X- shaped designs on their surface and Chris- tian beliefs in the passing and resurrection of Christ, the central dogma signified by the Latin cross and the crucifix itself.10 Kongo crucifixes were the result of a generative process in which Euro- pean religious ideas and artistic modes of representation were winter 2011 african arts 53</page><page sequence="3">2 Kongo crucifix Kongo kingdom; possibly 18th century.

In the course of this recombination, new meanings were created that surpassed and redefined both Catholic and cen- tral African ideas and symbols from a novel, Kongo Christian perspective. Sangamentos , in turn, offer additional insight into the process of religious change in the Kongo kingdom, consid- ered from the perspective of political discourse, historical nar- rative, and mythological thought. The dances illustrate how the adoption of Catholicism was, in contrast to the outcome of the coercive proselytism exercised elsewhere by Europeans, an inde- pendent phenomenon in which central Africans used a range of visual and narrative tools to integrate Christianity into their own worldview while simultaneously projecting the Kongo kingdom into the historical and diplomatic realm of Christendom. THE TWO PARTS OF THE SANGAMENTO The Capuchin friar Girolamo Merolla da Sorrento described sangamentos in the late seventeenth century as performances staged in two parts. In the first act, the dancers dressed "in the way of the country" with feathered headdresses and used bows and arrows as weapons.11 In the second act, the men changed their outfits and appeared wearing European hats also deco- rated with feathers, necklace chains, golden crosses, strings of 54 african arts winter 2011</page><page sequence="4">4 Coat of Arms of the King of Kongo in the Livro da Nobreza e da perfeição das armas , by António Godinho (Portugal, 1528-1541) Pigment and gold on parchment; 43cm x 32cm (17" X 121/г") PT/TT/CR/D/A/1/20, Direção Geral dos Arquivos- Torre do Tombo, Lisbon, MS CF-164, folio 7 (detail).

They also traded their bows and arrows for firearms, imported weapons that echo the use of European-style swords depicted in Figure 1. In the image as well as in the written text, the regalia of the performers defined two distinct parts in the ceremony that each called upon different cultural and symbolic referents. Yet these two sides formed in a meaningful, cohesive whole. The key to reading the cultural text of the sangamento resides, I argue, in the mytho- logical and political transformations that took place in Kongo thought with the advent of Christianity. In this light, the early part of the show, performed with the traditional local regalia and weaponry, staged the first foundation of the kingdom - centuries before the advent of Christianity- by Lukeni, the original civi- lizing hero of the Kongos creation myth. The subsequent per- formance, in which the dancers appeared in a mix of local and foreign attire, referred to the second founding of the kingdom in 1509 by Afonso, the first great Christian king of the Kongo.12 According to the myths in circulation in the Kingdom of Kongo, as they were transcribed in sixteenth to eighteenth cen- tury texts, Lukeni was a young foreign prince of extraordinary military skill who was banned from his homeland north of the Congo River for having murdered a member of his close family.13 The disgraced youth crossed the river and conquered the lands of his future kingdom in a great military feat probably made pos- sible by his command of iron technology, until then supposedly unknown to the people of the southern shore.14 In addition to military skill and iron smelting, the prince brought to the Kongo new forms of wisdom on which the traditions of the kingdom would be based.15 The earlier part of the sangamento celebrated this first foundation of the Kongo kingdom. In turn, a series of letters from Afonso to the Pope and to his own vassals written around 1512 narrated the kingdoms second founding as a Christian realm.16 Afonso was an early supporter of Catholicism and ascended to the throne after a bitter battle against one of his brothers who, in contrast, opposed the new religion. Wars of succession were common in the Kongo, since the crown was not inherited but bestowed by an electoral council. With the help of the miraculous apparition of Saint James lead- ing an army of horsemen, and under the cross of Constantine that reappeared in the central African sky on his behalf, Afonso defeated his heathen brother and won over the kingdom to Catholicism. This narrative was an ostensible attempt on the part of the new king to inscribe his reign in the historical and hagio- graphical tradition of Christianity. The recourse to the figure of Saint James, the Moor slayer of the Iberian Reconquista, as hea- then slayer in Africa is an astute gesture on the part of Afonso, similar to the later use of the warrior saint as Indian slayer by the conquistadores of the Americas.17 The later parts of the sanga- mentos were ritual reenactments of this second, Christian found- ing of the kingdom, during which dancers accordingly appeared dressed with what had become the characteristic regalia of the Kongo Christian nobility, a combination of insignia rooted in local symbolism with swords, crosses, and cloaks inspired by imported European objects. The particular items adopted from Europe, notably the red cape and the swords, were not coinci- dentally the ones central to the iconography of Saint James, as seen, for example, in the early sixteenth century Iberian depic- tion of the saint as Moor slayer in Figure 3. The elite performers were then no longer simply powerful men in the terms estab- lished by Lukeni, but also mighty Christian nobles emulating the example of Afonso and, through him, of Saint James. The narrative invented by Afonso and enacted in the dances also encompassed a visual dimension. In the same letters that reported the battle, the king described to his vassals the newly created coat of arms of the Kingdom of Kongo, which he pre- sented to them painted at the bottom of the text.18 The arms had been commissioned by the king of Portugal as a gift to his winter 2011 airican arts 55</page><page sequence="5">6 Sword of status Kongo Kingdom (1 6th- 1 9th century) Iron Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, EO. 1955.95.65.

The escutcheon, depicted in the Portuguese manuscript armo- rial by António Godinho, composed between 1521 and 1548, offers a further translation of the events, already transcribed by Afonso in writing and in Christian terms, in the typically Euro- pean format of heraldry (Fig. 4) (Godinho 1528-1541). In a nut- shell, following Afonsos glossing, the arms are composed of the white cross of Constantine appearing in the azure of the central African sky, the shells of Saint James "whom We called upon and who helped Us," the armored arms of the knights companions of the Saint, and, at the bottom, represent the destruction of two Kongo "idols," broken at the waist, on either side of the emblem of Portugal, featured as Kongo's benefactor and ally. Afonsos story and the coat of arms were rhetorical and visual means through which the Kongo monarch and his followers placed themselves firmly in the larger religious, diplomatic, and symbolic system of the early modern Atlantic as a land belong- ing to the realm of Christendom.20 As one observes by consid- ering the full page of the manuscript in which the arms of the Kongo appear placed alongside the emblems of other Christian nations such as Poland and Bohemia, this move was indeed suc- cessful (Fig. 5). Until well into the nineteenth century, when atti- tudes towards Africa dramatically changed under the influence of the pseudo-scientific racial and social theories of the time, no European nation seriously questioned the status of the Kongo as an independent Catholic polity.21 In an era otherwise defined in many regards by the Atlantic slave trade, this distinction was significant.

KONGO MYTH, CHRISTIAN HISTORY The letters of Afonso and the related practice of sangamentos also demonstrate how the adoption of Christianity in the Kongo was a process that involved a deep level of inward looking reflec- tion on the part of the central Africans as much as it was a strate- gic move turned outward to the viewership of European powers. The sophisticated cultural work performed by the letters was not merely a one-way translation of Kongo events into Christian terms. If the letters successfully positioned the Kongo as part of the realm of Christendom, they also inscribed Christianity into the symbolic syntax of central African mythology. The various recorded iterations of the origin myth as well as the narrative of the succession struggle in the letters each pres- ent a civilizing hero, Lukeni in .the earlier case and Afonso in the later, who is able to seize leadership of the Kongo through military might, thanks to the control of iron, first in the form of smelting and smithing technology and later that of sword-bear- ing cavalry. Both men eventually bring to the land a new form of wisdom, the one, Kongo cosmology and the other, Christi- anity. The bold and innovative narrative of Afonso thus became an integral part of Kongo mythological thought. It repeatedly appeared, with slight variations, in later oral histories recorded in early modern Kongo.22 This exceptional cross-cultural manip- ulation of symbols and narratives was made possible by the king's personal knowledge and particular life experience. He was well educated in central African mythology from his child- hood as a Kongo prince and studied Christian theology with the first European priests in the region during the reign of his father. According to the Portuguese vicar and resident of the Kongo Rui de Aguiar, he assiduously studied the history and the teachings of the Church, and eventually mastered an impressive knowl- edge of these disciplines.23 The story of the battle as explained in the letters of Afonso and depicted in the coat of arms could therefore simultaneously encompass a range of meanings depending on its readership. For the Europeans, it could be a straightforward account of the prov- idential continuity between the history of the Christian Church and that of the Kongo, as what they considered a pagan people entered into Christendom thanks to the miraculous interces- sion of Gods mighty crusader Saint James. For the people of the Kongo, however, it could be an evolution in their own mythol- ogy and symbolic identity, and judging from the deep and long- lasting presence of Christian ideas and imagery in the region, a satisfactory one. The strength of this transposition resides in part in the fact that the two stories are not mutually exclusive. With Afonsos narrative, Christianity becomes a new era of cen- tral African history, and in turn, Kongo takes its place within the universal history of the Church. In central African myths, Lukeni and Afonso are both civilizing heroes. From the perspective of Christian history, the coming of Lukeni in ancient times takes on the guise of a foreshadowing of Afonsos reign, a form of antiq- uity that prepared and announced the Christian era. The story presented pre-Christian Kongo in a parallel to Europe's own pre- Christian past as an ordered and deserving polity ripe to receive the Christian revelation. It thus set Kongo aside from other non- European lands that, from a European perspective, dwelled in more somber and difficultly redeemable states of heathenry or idolatry. Indeed, for a European audience, Afonsos miraculous celestial cross demonstrated a close link between early Christi- anity and the advent of the new faith in central Africa. It vividly recalled the cross that appeared to the Roman emperor Con- statine at the very moment when he and his realm turned away from their own gods to embrace Christianity. The European mis- sionaries working in central Africa took to that idea of a pagan, thus propitious history of the Kongo. The author of the water- color in Figure i, for example, commented several centuries after the time of Afonso that "contrary to the heathens of Brazil in the Americas who wander without Chief and without Law,[24] the Congo [...] people in Africa has always been governed by its [. . .] King" (Asti с. 1740:67).

Afonsos story is central to our understanding of the com- plex and layered process through which Christianity became a significant part of the religious and political worldview of the people of the Kongo. Its prominent place in the recorded oral histories of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries and the repeated occurrences of the sangamentos testifies to its core significance in the definition and success of a Kongo Chris- tian discourse. In the letters, and in the story, Afonso creatively reformulated Christian and local mythology and symbolism into a novel, coherent whole. In his texts, European turns of phrase, language, and narrative structure also resonate with Kongo cul- tural referents that together create a Kongo Christian syntax fit to express Kongo Christian ideas. IRON, SWORDS, AND POWER Similarly, in the sangamentos and in the regalia, the visual and material elements derived from Europe were no longer foreign or "other"; rather, they became objects whose significance was also embedded in local thought. The iron swords of status car- ried by central African nobles were powerful illustrations of this process of transposition and appropriation (Fig. 6). The symbolic weight carried by iron in central Africa was one of the keys to the successful association of European-derived social and visual attributes of nobility with Kongo ideas of power and legitimacy. The myths discussed earlier located the creation of the kingdom at the moment of the concomitant arrival of iron technology and the civilizing hero and founding king. Visual and linguistic semantic tools centered on the figure of the king perpetuated the close link between smelting, smithing, kingship, and the origins of the kingdom. The association of kingship and smithing was reinforced by ceremonial performances and by several elements of his regalia (Balandier 1965:23, Thornton 1992). 25 During the ruler s coronation rites, described at length by the Jesuit Mateus Cardoso in 1622, two iron anvils were struck together, a "very old custom" that reproduced the thud of a blacksmiths hammer and accompanied by its rhythmic sound the course of the cer- emonies.26 Bill Dewey and Terry Childs also noted the enduring significance in the twentieth century of iron and iron working in Luba myths expressed with a similar set of metaphorical perfor- mances, which served to make "manifest the interconnections among religion, politics, and technology" (1996:62). The newly elected Kongo monarch also received the "ancient" iron emblems of the simba chain and the malunga brace- let as attributes of his function. The gilded malunga , Cardoso explained, "stands for the kingdom that is given to [the king] [...] and just as the malunga is of iron, so the kingdom is of iron, and for this reason it is called Congo riactari that is to say Congo of Iron" (Brásio 1988:492). The word malunga itself participates in an extensive semantic field in Central Bantu languages that encompasses ideas of perfection in the sense of completeness, cyclical time, military might, and personal fortitude that are also paramount to the symbolism of iron in central Africa (Ceyssens 1998:126-33). The significance of the topoi of the iron kingdom and the blacksmith king may be judged from their widespread occurrence in the foundation myths of many central African polities (de Heusch i982:ch 5, Pierre de Maret 1980, Volavka and Thomas 1998). Afonso anchored his reformulation of the central African foundation myth into the story of his own victory as Chris- tian ruler precisely on the shared European and Kongo seman- tic link between iron and power, materialized in the swords prominently carried by Saint James and his miraculous army of knights. In the narrative of the battle, the military superiority achieved by Lukeni thanks to the knowledge of iron technology was powerfully echoed in the large iron swords of Saint James and his followers. The prominent role of the iron weapons was emphasized in the original coat of arms described by Afonso and remained the central focus of the emblem as it was simpli- fied and refocused over time.

At another level, however, the material, shape, and decorations of the weapons carried key features referring to Kongo visual syn- tax and to their ceremonial use in the sangamentos. The martial exercises were a means for central African men to demonstrate their value as warriors and to demonstrate the aggression that they would be capable of in battle.31 The swords used in the performances conveyed these latter ideas through their material, referring back to the military prowess of Lukeni and Saint James, but also through their very shape. The end of the pommel, often pierced with two holes, resembled a human head and face and conferred on the swords a distinct anthro- pomorphic look (Fig. 6). As Robert Farris Thompson already suggested in 1981, the guard protecting the blade was shaped to suggest the arms of a human figure, one arm down, and the other up above the head. This attitude, I would add, also directly reflected the use made of the weapon in the sangamentos, dur- ing which the dancers brandished their swords while stretching their arms, one up and one down, to convey physically an intim- idating message of strength, power, and aggression (Fig. 8).32 In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ideas of aggres- sion and might continued to be expressed with the same ges- 60 airican arts winter 2011</page><page sequence="10">1 3 Detail of Figure 4, broken figures on the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Kongo PHOTO: COURTESY OF ANTT The coat of arm of the kings of Kongo included the representation of an "idol," broken at the waist, adopting the characteristic attitude of the nkisi nkonde, one arm up, the other down. ture in Kongo artistic productions. Central African carvers used similar formal means in their minkisi minkonde (sg. nkisi nkonde ), menacing figures looming against enemies and trai- tors, one arm up with a weapon, the other down on the hip (Fig. 9). Alternatively, the guard of the swords, the sanga- mento dancers, and the nkonde sometimes adopted the pos- ture of arms akimbo, fists planted on the hips in a gesture of determination (Fig. 10). The wide-open, beaming eyes of the figures - like those of the dancers - complete their ominous, hyper- vigilant look. The affinity between the swords and the minkonde is in fact more than formal. The wooden figures were activated by the driving of nails or sharp pieces of metal into their flesh. Often, a larger, more powerful shard was struck into their heart.33 In at least one instance, the activating metal piece plunged into the chest of a large and mighty nkonde was the top part of a Kongo sword of status (Figs. 11-12). 34 The wooden figure pierced in the heart with a sword offers tantalizing reso- nances with the European iconography of the Virgin of Sor- rows and several other saints. Similarly, a shell reminiscent of the type emblematic of Saint James, which prominently fea- tured in the Kongo coat of arms, tops the nkonde in Figure 8. These two details offer an evocative demonstration of how central African and European visual and symbolic syntaxes met and interplayed over the centuries in complex interlacing streams, from the first moments of contact with Christianity circa 1500 into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There are no known examples of minkonde from the early modern period. However, in the light of the preceding discus- sion on the characteristic Kongo position of the arms, I am able to link the two "broken idols" represented in Afonso's coat of arms to this category of menacing objects.35 The painting rep- resented two figures, broken at the waist into two pieces (Fig. 13). Their bottom halves stood in the center as two pairs of legs resting on a base or pedestal. The top parts were depicted as two upper bodies with their arms in the pose witnessed in the swords, the sangamento dancers, and the nkisi nkonde , one arm up and the other down, in a menacing stance. The so-called idols of the coat of arms were destroyed as vestiges of the Kongo's pre- Christian past, yet the gesture with which they signified their power remained. The mighty pose of the broken figures found its way into the Kongo swords, where it continued to offer its intimidating message of strength and power, but this time at the service of the once opposing camp. CONCLUSION From the dancers to the swords, from the coat of arms to the nkisi nkonde , local and foreign cultural currents, early mod- ern Kongo and Christian religious traditions run and merge in complex interlacing streams. Essential Kongo concepts that went back to its myth of creation were entwined with European ideas and images to address the circumstances of a new, Catholic organization of the kingdom. The narrative laid out by Afonso provided the prism through which to read, from a Kongo per- spective, the transformations that the region experienced in the early modern period. A prominent part of the changes consisted of the adoption of some of the visual expressions of power and nobility of the European Christian tradition. The Kongo nobles borrowed from their Portuguese counterparts central attributes of the nobleman, such as the sword, and transposed them into elements of regalia reflecting Kongos own worldview. Eventually, the iron swords and the sangamento demonstrated how local and foreign came together in the Kongo in a process in which cross-cultural change was as much an introspective exercise as it was a strategic move directed at outward viewer- ship. The example of the Kongo highlights an important mode of visual and religious encounter in the early modern era, one in which cross-cultural change was not the product of a rela- tionship of oppression and resistance but rather the result of an elaborate visual and symbolic conversation between one cultures definition of itself and the possibilities that a widening world brought to its shores.

The Latin cognate of sanguis, - inis , 'blood', which carried connotations opposite to that of kusanga was not, to my knowledge, associated with the term during that period. 2 Kongo is spelled with a "K" by historians to dif- ferentiate the historical kingdom from the nineteenth century European colonial construction of the Congo, spelled with a "C." In this article I use the term Kongo as an adjective meaning "relative to the Kingdom of Kongo" and not as an ethnonym. 3 Astis image belongs to a codex in a particu- lar genre of illustrated manuscripts developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by the members of the Capuchin Order's central African missions (see Fromont 2011a). 4 Oral testimonies of the creation and early history of the kingdom were recorded as early as the sixteenth century, for instance in Lopes and Pigafetta (1591). The 1624 manuscript by Mateus Cardoso from the Biblioteca Nacional in Lisbon also captured the history of the kingdom; see the modern edition by Brásio (1969). In the mid- seventeenth century, Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi recorded more comprehensive accounts of the origins of the kingdom that were published posthumously (Cavazzi and Alamandini 1687). Clist (1991) presents an overview of the scarce archeological data available. 5 See Rui de Pina, chronicler for the royal house of Portugal. Radulet (1992) provides a critical edition. 6 Cuvelier (1946) discusses the early period of the history of the Kingdom of Kongo. Thornton (1983) analyzes the seventeenth century. See Kabwita (2004) for the later periods. 7 Sangamentos were also staged in the neighbor- ing Loango Kingdom, north of the Congo River (de Grandpré 1801, 1:116) and in the Kingdom of Matamba to the South (Cavazzi 1687:656). 8 Sangamentos were staged on saints' days that held particular local significance, such as Saint James' Day, as discussed below. They also marked feasts of the liturgical calendar such as Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, etc. See Bontinck's modern edition of Giovanni Fran- cesco da Roma (Roma and Bontinck 1964:129-31). 9 See also the Jesuit records of 1622, AGSJ, Rome, Lus. T. 55, f 115V published by Jadin (1968:363). Da Lucca also mentions this use, as well as that in diplomatic receptions; see the manuscript compilation of his letters by Filippo Bernardi da Firenze (1700-1717:99-100, 186). 10 For an analysis of the meaning of the sign of the cross in the Kongo in the early modern period, see Fromont (2011b). The visual and religious syntax of the Kongo and related peoples in the twentieth century, yet with insights on the earlier period has been studied in important volumes by Wing (1921), Janzen (1982), and MacGaffey (1986). 11 The exact phrase used in the Italian text is " all'uso del paese " (Merolla da Sorrento and Piccardo 1692:157). The most detailed of the many eyewitness description of the sangamento in the early modern period was recorded around 1648 by Giovanni Franc- esca da Roma (1648:125-28). Castelo de Vide (1780:137), Anguiano (1950:77, 279), and Caltanisetta (Caltanisetta and Bontinck 1970:5) offer descriptions of sangamentos in addition to the ones quoted elsewhere in this article. Marcellino d'Atri also witnessed a sangamento in 1696; see the published transcription of his manuscript in Toso and Atri (1984:141). 12 Afonso was not the first Christian Kongo king; his father and predecessor had previously converted, but he was a great advocate of the new faith and the monarch who truly established Christianity as the Kon- go's state religion and the Kongo as a Christian state. Note also that Merolla himself hints at the link between the sangamento and the second founding, explaining that the main ceremony takes place on Saint James' Day as a tribute for the victory he helped secure for Afonso (see Merolla da Sorrento and Piccardo 1692:156). 13 I refer here to the oral traditions as they were told in the Kingdom of Kongo from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. 14 Heusch (1972, 1982) and Vansina (1966) have described and analyzed creation myths in central Africa. Note that the date suggested by the narrative for the introduction of iron technology in the region is unrealistically late. 15 An anonymous report in the Propaganda Fide archives from the early eighteenth century places the origins of the Kongo Royal House in "a very sagacious and astute smith" (see Propaganda Fide Archives, SCR, Africa, Angola, Congo, vol. 1 [1645-1685] f. 141Г). In turn, Cavazzi links the arrival of iron technology with that of the first kings of Kongo and notes a similar association between smithing and the founding king for the Kingdom of Dongo (see Cavazzi and Alamandini 1687:169, 290). 16 The letters are published in Brásio (1952 i:docs 68-72). 17 See Domínguez García (2006). The later reap- propriation of Saint James in Afro-American religions also points to tantalizing perspectives about the role of Kongo Christianity in the shaping of the experience of enslavement among men and women of central African heritage in the Americas. 18 The image is now lost (Brásio 1952 1:263). Bon- tinck (1962) briefly discusses the coat of arms. 19 The now missing letter is mentioned in a 1512 text by Afonso (Brásio 1952 1:232). It is also mentioned in a subsequent brief dated October 5, 1514 (Brásio 1952 1:295). See also Thornton (2006:443, note 21). 20 Here I use the term Christendom as a concept that defines a geographical space of its own, in the man- ner suggested by Greer and Mills (2007). 21 The notable exception of Portugal should be noted here, as it occasionally attempted to argue the dis- appearance of Christianity in the Kongo in a strategic effort to justify its expansionist claims to the African realm as an extension of their colony of Angola. Indeed, it could not colonize a Christian kingdom. The need for such loud pronouncements in effect demonstrates the status quo against which they stood. 22 Several other iterations of the origin myth of the kingdom recorded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries present a structurally similar narrative (see for example Jadin 1970:452-53) 23 Rui de Aguiar writes in a 1516 letter to the king of Portugal: "I certify to your Highness that [Afonso] teaches us and knows more than we do about the Prophets, the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and all the lives of the Saints and everything about the Holy Mother Church [...] he does not do anything but study and often he falls asleep on top of his books" (Brásio 1952 1:361, my translation). 24 "Without Chief and without Law" is in Latin in the text: " sine Duce et sine Lege vagantur'.' This is a reference to the Portuguese rhyme "sem fé, sem lei, sem rei" used by European commentators to describe the perceived linguistic and cultural flaws of the Brazilian indigenous populations (Monteiro 2000:703-704). 25 Wannyn (1961:10) even suggests that the king received the title of ngangula a Kongo or "smith of the Kongo." 26 Brásio (1988:490) printed the account by Mateus Cardoso. It is available in English (Thornton 1992). Maret (1985) also discusses the coronation. 27 The coat of arms appears in one of the two folded maps of Lopes and Pigafettas early publication (1591) and in Cavazzi and Alamandini (1687:274). In the late eigh- teenth century, Cherubino da Savona describes the "arms of the kingdom of Congo, that is to say the five swords that appeared in the air during the time of king Afonso I to defend him against his enemies" (Jadin 1963:406). 28 A version of the story recorded in 1622, for instance, attributed the victory of Afonso to a miracu- lous rain of swords that defeated his heathen brother (Brásio 1988:489). 29 The straight Kongo swords are close to fifteenth and sixteenth century Iberian examples, with the guard in the same plane as the blade and without the coiled hilt that defined later types such as rapiers. The European origin of the design of the Kongo swords has been the main focus for their study (Wannyn 1951). The watercolor in Figure 1 depicts two sorts of swords, scimitars with curved blades and straight blades; I focus here on examples of the later type. 30 Schellings (1950) briefly published some of the findings of Ngongo Mbata. 31 Thornton (1999:105) underlines the role played by the dances as military training. See the late sixteenth century description of "sanguar" as a defensive tech- nique (Brásio 1952 4:563). 32 Robert Farris Thompson related the anthro- pomorphic look and gesture of the pommel to niombo reliquary figures (Thompson and Cornet 1981:62-63, 65). Drawing from Congolese scholar Fu-Kiau Bunseki's teachings, he proposed a reading of the first gesture, one arm up and the other down, as an expression of the Kongo cosmogram conveying ideas of death and regen- eration (Fu-kiau kia Bunseki-Lumanisa 1969). See also Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz (2009). 33 See chapter 5, "Beyond the Scripture - Physical Forms of Graphic Writing" in Barbaro Martinez- Ruiz's forthcoming book, Kongo Graphic Writing and Other Narratives of the Sign. 34 Observation drawn from a personal study of the object in June 2007 in the reserves of the Royal Museum for central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. 35 There is a considerable literature on late nine- teenth and twentieth century minkisi mkonde but I present here for the first time evidence of the existence of an earlier similar form. For discussion of minkisi see for example MacGaffey (1988) and Volavkova (1972). References Cited Propaganda Fide Archives, c. 1700.
