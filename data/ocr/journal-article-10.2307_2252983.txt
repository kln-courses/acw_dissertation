<plain_text><page sequence="1">Atheism and the Rejection of God: Contemporary Philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov. By STEWART R. SUTHERLAND. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1977. Pp. viii+ x52. ~6.75. Through the character of Ivan Karamazov 'Dostoyevsky explored the profundity of at least one form of atheism, and in response to this he outlines a form of religious belief which he regarded as at least a potential alternative to: Ivan' (p. I). Atheism and Christian belief, Stewart Suther- land claims, are not merely rival speculative hypotheses; and the issue between them cannot fairly be presented as merely the appraisal of evidence and argument for and against God's existence. God is too often conceived as a problematic existent among existents, and the quest for him too like the quest for the Loch Ness Monster. The thinness and perversity of such approaches were well realized by Dostoyevsky, though they have not been by various more recent philosophers; and the issue between Ivan's atheism and the faith of Zossima and Alyosha is shown, in The Brothers Karamazov, to have complexity and depth. The issue crucially involves questions of alternative 'forms of life', their coherence and intelligibility: at least as much stress is put upon emotions and constellations of emotions as is put upon the probings of intellect. Ivan's atheism took the form of 'rebellion' against the conception of a God allegedly perfect, but whose created world sees cruel atrocities inflicted even upon children. No 'future harmony' is acceptable if it is preceded by the suffering of innocents. Ivan does not argue for a specu- lative denial of God's existence, but expresses moral repugnance at the only role he sees the concepts and language of religion as able to play. He thus denies 'validity or intelligibility to a way of life in which... prayer and worship can play a significant and meaningful part' (p. 35). Can a person centre his attitudes upon 'rebellion' and yet also have compassionate concern for others? As well as discussing this question as it appears in The Brothers Karamazov, Sutherland briefly considers contrasting treatments of it in Kierkegaard, Camus and Simone Weil. Ivan's legend or 'poem' on the Grand Inquisitor naturally calls for analysis. Sutherland sees the picture of Christ there as 'much more ambivalent' than do some commentators. The poem is not a vindication</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 313 of Christ, nor is the Grand Inquisitor presented as wholly unsym- pathetic or evil. Ivan rejects the 'gift of freedom' offered by Christ: it cannot adequately justify the suffering it brings with it to its recipients. The Inquisitor has more regard for human weakness, and he 'embodies that aspect of all of us which wants to help others who cannot help themselves' (p. 76). The philosophical interest of the novel is intensified by remarks in a letter of Dostoyevsky, cited by Sutherland, in which he speaks both of the powerful case for atheism expressed through the character of Ivan, and of his hope to present an 'answer' to the atheistic view through the elder Zossima, in Book VI of the novel. The answer would be not in the form of argument and counter-evidence, but of an 'artistic picture'. Sutherland properly asks, 'How could a piece of fiction possibly help resolve a philosophical argument?' What the language of fiction is doing here, he suggests, is setting forth a 'form of life'. (Compare Wittgenstein: '. . . to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life'.) The enter- prise would succeed if some form of Christian life could give a role to moral and religious discourse-a role other than that which Ivan under- stands and rejects. We must ask of Zossima's (and Alyosha's) way of life in which reconciling, active love is central: can this form of life 'give a possible response to evil and suffering, which involves neither despair nor moral abdication?' (p. 88). This question dominates the rest of the book. Sutherland argues that the novel in fact offers a 'far reaching reformulation' of basic religious notions. The coherence and adequacy of Zossima's form of life is dis- played by the fact that it contains criteria for discriminating truth from falsehood, and for discriminating appearance from reality. So far so good. But does the answer to Ivan succeed completely? To Zossima, the beauty and mystery of the world 'bear witness to the mystery of God' (p. I35). He is not setting forth a 'reductionist' religious view, nor a form of agnostic spirituality. 'Does Zossima [then] ask Ivan to accept the suffering of innocent children as the will of God?' If so, he asks what to Ivan 'is to "alter the facts" '. Ivan's questions remain unanswered; and the novel has delineated irreconcilable metaphysical views, no one of which can be taken as authoritative or victorious over the others. I agree that Ivan has not been answered. Despite Sutherland's claim that Dostoyevsky's approach is methodologically 'impeccable' and despite Sutherland's appeal to Wittgenstein, the setting forth of Zos- sima's form of life could not possibly show that worship, rather than rebellion, was ultimately appropriate, given the suffering of the innocent. Only argument, metaphysical and moral, could show that the infinite goodness, power and knowledge of God are reconcilable with the human barbarity that God apparently allows to occur. (Assuming that anything at all could show it.) That this is not evident from the start is partly due to the fact that Sutherland does not discriminate clearly enough between different strands in Ivan's rejection of belief. Zossima and Alyosha certainly show that a living context can be furnished for concepts like moral regeneration, change of heart, forgiveness and love. They can show that certain religious concepts are no more than parodied in glib</page><page sequence="3">314 BOOK REVIEWS superficial debates pro and con belief. They can show the inadequacy of the either/or implied in Ivan's legend. We need neither surrender to the Inquisitor's man-management nor accept a radical freedom with which few men could cope. But the fact that Zossima's form of life can be conceptualized and lived out cannot show that the perfections of God can be reconciled with the state of the world as we experience it, or that, when the extent of evil is vividly realized, rebellion rather than worship is not the more morally defensible stance. The impressiveness of the religious and moral experiences expressed in Dostoyevsky's 'answer' to Ivan cannot by itself show that these are founded on a sounder, more coherent interpretation of how things ultimately are than is Ivan's own view. Again, the fact that distinctions between truth and falsehood and between appearance and reality are made at some points (and over limited ranges of data) within the artistic picture does not give help of the kind most needed. These discriminations are highly relevant to the literary effectiveness with which the form of life is presented: it is no cardboard cut-out, but has density. There could, however, be equally dense rival and incompatible fictional 'worlds' and possible forms of life. That Ivan is not finally answered Sutherland agrees, as we have seen. Yet his journey to the conclusion is rather laborious. Perhaps the Witt- gensteinian 'form-of-life' theme promised more illumination on the way than it eventually yielded. And Dostoyevsky himself had claimed that Book VI would attempt to answer (even to 'refute') the powerful case made for atheism by Ivan. (There is indeed a clash between that authorial claim and a final judgment that Dostoyevsky's novel contains no uniquely affirmed view, but several views in tension.) It would have been valuable to have a fuller discussion of the relation between unbelief, rebellion, moral concern and the nihilism of 'all is permitted', with more detailed analyses of the other writers mentioned and a more sustained consideration of the issues, as live issues, by Sutherland himself. A reader would find it helpful also to have a clearer indication of the view of God's reality with which Sutherland would like to replace anthropomorphic and otherwise inadequate versions. This remains, no doubt inevitably, outside the scope of his present enquiry. UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH R. W. HEPBURN</page></plain_text>
