All materials were handed over to the so-called taricheutai (embalmers). They were responsible for the cleaning of the bones and their wrapping with linen bandages. At a later stage of use of the necropolis, in toto mummification of sacred birds was achieved using chemicals (see below).

Between day 14 Cormorant Phalacrocorax africanus (1) and Nile puffer . . . . . Tetraodon fahaka (1) and 21 they leave the nest and congregate into loose flocks but are still fed by their parents. Around day 21 the young ibis reaches c. 30-50 % of the adult's body size. From day 35 of their life onwards the birds become capable of some flight. At this stage their legs still show broadenend tarsal joints indicating that the distal articulation of the tibia (ontogenetically the proximal row of the tarsal bones) and the proximal articulation of the metatarsus (ontogenetically the distal row of the tarsal bones) are still unfused. It is said that on day 50 at the latest the ibis leaves the colony (Urban 1982, 201 f.). However, at this stage of life the tarsal joint is not yet fully developed, i.e. the articular ends of the tibia and the metatarsus still show clear fusion-zones; besides, the three metatarsals which in adults are completely fused are still separated proximally. 90 days is consid ered an absolute minimum for the skeleton of the Sacred Ibis to be fully developed. We have tried to correlate the biological data described above with the osteological and Osteo metrie data obtained on Threskiornis bones, though the data presented in Table 1 must be considered tentative.

The ratio Sacred Ibis : Glossy Ibis is 11 : 1 Gallery C, branch C-C In passage C-C we collected 261 birds belonging to at least 30 taxa (Table 5). Threskiornis mummies make up to 69 % of the assemblage, all age classes being represented. In G-C-6 an ibis mummy con taining an egg of a stork (Ciconia sp.) was found. 16 mummies yielded exclusively feathers or plant materials and one mummy contained numerous small snails (Cleopatra bulimoides), which presum ably represent the stomach contents of an ibis. Complete non-ibis mummies have been found in C-G-8 (Elanus caeruleus, Accipiter nisus, Circus aerug inosas), C-C-ll (Falco tinnunculus, Accipiter nisus) and C-C-22 (Falco tinnunculus). As usual most species other than ibis are very incomplete. At the entrance of the Ptolemaic decorated baboon chamber C-C-4 we found a large number of bones of diurnal and nocturnal birds of prey, together with numerous pieces of linen torn apart. Conceivably these mummies had been placed originally to the side of the entrance of the baboon chamber. The avian assemblage collected in front of C-C-4 contained 161 individuals of 25 species of diurnal birds of prey and four species of owls (Table 6).

Excluded and small heaps of calcified greyish-whitish bones from Table 9 is an accumulation of bones of birds and bone ashes (cf. Wahl 2001).</page><page sequence="22">224 Angela von den Driesch, Dieter Kessler, Frank Steinmann, Véronique Berteaux and Joris Peters Complete individuals other than ibis have been recovered from B-A-7 (two falcon-shaped Falco tinnunculus and one falcon-shaped Elanus caeruleus) and B-C-9 (a falcon-shaped Falco cher rug mummy). Two femora from B-A-2a and one humerus from B-C-7 are of particular interest. These three bones belong to the Reef Heron Egretta gularis, a heron species inhabiting coastal areas. Gallery B, branch B-E The survey work in Gallery B, branch B-E pro duced a Minimum Number of Individuals of 842 from 50 different bird taxa (Table 11). Like the assemblage from passages B-A, B-C and B-D, the bulk of the bird bones is very fragmentary, with many pottery jars containing calcinated bones. Only exceptionally could bones from the same individual be brought together. One classical ibis mummy was manufactured exclusively of Threskiornis feathers, whereas four falcon-shaped mummies contained feathers from unknown species. Complete or almost complete non-ibis mummies were found in B-E-l (falcon shaped Falco biarmicus mummy), B-E-6 (Circus cya neus), in the gangway between B-E-9 and B-E-l 1 (falcon-shaped Falco tinnunculus mummy), in B-E-l 4 (falcon-shaped Circus aeruginosus mummy), B-E-l7 (two Falco tinnunculus, calcinat ed, in two pots), B-E-23 (Gyps fulvus mummy, destroyed) and B-E-23f (anthropomorphic Cir caetos gallicus mummy). The presence in B-E-2 of a tibiotarsus of Egret ta gularis is noted. Skeletal size and sexual dimorphism From the ornithological literature, we know that male Threskiornis possess longer and heavier bills than females and this criterion can be used to sex the birds unequivocally (Urban 1982, 200; Lowe &amp; Richards 1991) (cf. Table 12). Sexing is also possi ble using the length of the long bones of the wings and legs, but there is considerable overlap in size between the sexes (Lowe &amp; Richards 1991). This observation is paralleled in the post-cranial ibis remains collected from Tuna el-Gebel, which shows a more or less clear bimodal distribution depending on the skeletal element selected for analysis. Fig. 22 shows a clear clustering of the tar sometatarsal measurements into two groups, a Table 10 Taxonomic diversity and frequency of diurnal smaller (female) and a larger (male) one, with a and nocturnal birds of prey sampled near the entrance of considerable overlap, though.

The ratio Sacred Ibis : Glossy Ibis is 13 : 1 parts of the galleries, we feel confident that male and female ibises have been deposited in more or less equal numbers. Obviously the sex of the birds did not play a decisive role, except for the birds placed individually in sarcophagi and wooden chests, which are almost exclusively large males.

Discussion In the subterranean galleries of Tuna el-Gebel the remains of at least 3744 birds (426 in Gallery D, 1678 in Gallery C and 1640 in Gallery B) plus 239 bird eggs and 94 bundles or mummies containing only feathers and/or reed grass (nest material) were sampled. This is a relatively small amount considering the fact that the original number of birds and eggs deposited may easily surpass one million individuals. Only a few spots in the gal leries have been sampled more rigorously, e.g., the areas in front of the cult chambers. On the other hand, some branches of the galleries could Humerus with healed fracture ' not be sampled because of the danger of collaps ing of the surrounding rock strata.
