The urge to presence wins the day, but only just, by virtue of that which is not the same as presence, an ultimate, saving ... fiction. A rich survey of theory and a compelling theory of texts, Eakin's book is re- quired and readable reading for all students of autobiography, whatever their critical persuasion. The reservations I hold are those, on my reading, shared by Eakin himself in the form of neuralgic symptoms, points of stress exiled to the margins of his discourse to better its chances of coherence. For coherence itself, as the interpretability of any text shows, is at one level always an exercise in damage limitation, always - to raise again Eakin's own colorful flag of convenience - another "fiction." JOHNNIE GRATTON University College, Belfield, Dublin Actes du IVe Colloque du S.E.L., Le Personnage en Question. Toulouse: Universite de Toulouse-Le Mirail, 1984. 416 pp. Modern poetics has found a resonance in the most diverse quarters; literary theory has created a transnational bond among people who study different literatures. Although the advantage of Anglo-American and French letters in this field is clear - they are the perennial source of exempla - texts from other cultures have also been incorporated, and among the latest arrivals the contributions of the Hispanic world should be counted. Books by Jorge Luis Borges and the cadre of contem- porary Latin American writers (Cort'azar, Garcia Mfarquez, Fuentes, Vargas LLosa) - the heart of western postmodernism - have become frequent references, joining the traditional ones, such as Cervantes, Ortega y Gasset and Unamuno. Further- more, Hispanists have become more interested in theoretical problems. A clear sign of the healthy state of affairs is the book under consideration here: a collection of articles (thirty-five plus the first act of a play drawn from a well-known novel, Yo el Supremo, by Augusto Roa Bastos) revolving around the notion of character. Most of the essays are by French Hispanists, whose contributions have been cross- fertilized by the divergence of their methodologies and fields of specialization, ranging from history of art, the study of film, and sociological criticism, to psycho- analysis and semiotics. They deal primarily with theoretical questions about character, using texts from Hispanic literatures, although there is a section devoted solely to French literature. After reading this compact book, I find that Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan's words remain valid: "Indeed, the elaboration of a systematic, non-reductive but also non- impressionistic theory of character remains one of the challenges poetics has not yet met" (1983:29). One further point may be added: the partiality or provincial- ism used to survey the work done on character seems greater than that prevailing in other areas. There is, for example, an absolute absence of traditional Anglo- American theorists on the subject in this book (and in many others; Anglo- American critics naturally respond in kind with similar aloofness). The guiding luminaries are A.J. Greimas, above all, and Philippe Hamon, one of the contribu- tors. In an essay on narratological problems one may find names like Wayne C. Booth (USA), perhaps Gerard Genette (France) and Mieke Bal (The Netherlands), together with Vladimir Propp or Boris Uspensky (USSR), to cite just a few that are Poetics Today, Vol. 7:3 (1986) 567-569</page><page sequence="2">568 NEW BOOKS immediately recognizable due to the visibility of the author's writings. The study of narrative discourse profits from the ample launching ground; well-known books and anthologies like the one by Rimmon-Kenan mentioned above have done a great service by providing a common basis from which to begin an inquiry. The situation as regards literary character is different. Aspects of the Novel (1927), by E.M. Forster, is one of the few classics widely referred to, but that is not the case with other important studies, such as Charles C. Walcutt's Man's Changing Mask: Modes and Methods of Characterization in Fiction (1966), or William J. Harvey's Character and the Novel ( 196 5). The "Avant-Propos" opens with a reference to the death of the literary charac- ter in the nouveau roman, with Alain Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute as the prime executioners. This question is addressed by most of the authors in this volume who conclude, as Milagros Ezquerro puts it, that the figure banished at the door jumps back in through the window. The other constant in the book is the references to Greimas, whose notions of character are taken up over and over again, although his categories (actant, acteur, fonction) are perceived as too narrow; various critics take repeated exception to his view, and offer their particular examples. The main contribution of the volume to the study of character springs precisely from this constant confrontation between texts and theory, resulting in a positive expansion of Greimas's ideas and of the notion of characters in general. The approaches favored here tend to adopt a broad semiotic stance, and include phenomena ranging from the consideration of the rituals of an accused before a jury, where he is asked to maintain a certain decorum so as to fit a predetermined role (Simone LeCointe), to representation in a painting (Henriette Besis) or psychoanalytical investigation (Alain Roger). After one of the best sections, "Pour une theorie du personnage" (five papers by Milagros Ezquerro, Claude Chauchadis, Jean Alsina, Michelle Debaux, and Michele Ramond), we are offered some conclusions ("Petite Conclusion") that seem to sum up the general consensus reached during the Colloquium at the Universite de Toulouse-Le Mirail which is reviewed here. These conclusions are distributed on several levels, beginning with the textual one: [1] character is a complex semio- logical system that involves the levels of actant, actor and role and that may be con- structed by quite diverse materials; [2] character is in essence a representation of the person: the mimetic aspect may or may not be underlined, and sometimes the representation profits from a transgression to hidden aspects of the person; [3] character is both a preexisting construct (forme-structure) and a produced one (forme substance). The construction may be long (a verbal text) or almost instan- taneous (photography). When considered on another level, the ideological, [4] it is noted that in a character, the ideology of the producteur and that of society co- incide and, moreover, the reader's ideology contributes to the configuration. Finally, on a psychological level, [5] character is the place of subjective ex- perience; it invites the reader to take part in its adventure through the mirror created by the anthropomorphic illusion. Other sections of the book deal specifically with character in "Classiques Espag- nols," the "Roman Hispanique Contemporain" or " Textes Francais." Theoretical speculation is not present, and Greimas continues to provide the necessary support. Genevieve Champeau and her "Le traitement des personnages dans Si te dicen que cai, de Juan Marse" is a case in point; she presents an exemplary close reading of Mars6's novel, guided by the possibility of several acteurs fitting the same actantial role. She also deals effectively with the notion of integration, showing how the characters interact on several levels, mainly those of story and spatiotemporal structure. Composition of fictive beings becomes a point of convergence in the text, where the way in which this novelistic element is transfused by others can be studied. Among the many problems broached in these Actes, the onomastic one figures</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS 569 prominently in four essays (by Bernard Magne, Georges Maurand, Maruice Molho, and Alicia Redondo), and myth and history, in another four (Mercedes Blanco, Borita Nouhaud, Benise Bover, Guy Marcadier). There is also a section on "Image ct Personnage" (Monique Carcaud-Macaire, Henriette Besis and Eric Beaumatin). Essays by Philippe Hamon and Daniel Sibony and the play by Roa Bastos round off the volume in the section entitled "Finale: Creation et Theories." Hamon's "Heros, herau t, hierarchies" calls attention to the usual tendency to equate characters with heroes. He remarks that the construction of character is not always linear, that it can be hierarchical, that readers follow the story as they distribute the elements of the narrative according to differentvalue systems. This observation, what I will call the hyponymic component of the reading, leads him to propose two ways of studying the problem of the hero as distinct from that of character. First, he ad- vocates establishing a point in the text, the hierarchie, a hyponymic zero around which the norms and values are set, where the confluence of values takes place. Secondly, in order to lay the foundation for a "poetics of hierarchy," one has to pinpoint those privileged places where the evaluation of a character permits one to say that his/hers is the dominant one, establishing it according to four systems: the savoir-dire (how the personage uses grammar, syntax, etc.), savoir-faire (how he/she interacts with others), the savoir-jouir (how the character deals with the world through his senses), and lastly, the savoir-vivre (how he/she deals with soci- ety's mores, rituals, and laws). The hero is extracted from the study of these four areas. The fact that there seems to be no communication among theoreticians on this subject causes much ground to be covered redundantly. Mary Dole Springer (A Rhetoric of Literary Character: Some Women of Henry James, 1978) has already spoken about character as a compositional element; in fact, she also covers some of the ground touched by Hamon, such as the importance of considering speech characteristics or the importance of habits in sketching a character's make-up. Nonetheless, the book reaches a point of consensus that confirms and comple- ments work done in other spheres by other theoreticians like Joseph Ewen or Leo Bersani. The character "jumping back in" through the window is framed in a much more complex form than the one agains twhich the nouveau roman writers re- acted; it is perceived as integrated with other elements in the text and its "lightness of being" is no more.

Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1984. 189 pp. The title and subtitle of this book between them roughly locate the author's two points of focus: 1) the difficulties of "self-representation, " manifested in a series of autobiographical efforts to cope with the irreconcilable differences between being and writing and 2) how being in the present is itself affected in and through such textual efforts. Though Paul Jay's historical interest concerns the effects of modern shifts in epistemology that first appeared markedly in Romantic auto- biography, his themes are demonstrable as far back as St. Augustine.
