<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 147 CANON STREETER'S THEORY OF REALITY Dr. B. H. Streeter, Canon of Hereford and Fellow of Queen's Col- lege, Oxford, is well known in the theological world, as editor and a lead- ing contributor in connection with four successive volumes, Foundations, Concerning Prayer, Immortality, and The Spirit, and as author of the original and important critical work, The Four Gospels. In his recently published book, Reality,' he gives us the result of his attempt to discover the truth about the Universe by means of a fresh correlation of religion and science. Materialism is criticized as failing to realize that its mechanomor- phism is no explanation of reality without some sort of anthropomorphism. Actual machines, as going concerns, are not only the product of intelli- gence and purpose; they have to be used and controlled by intelligent purpose. Ultimately the Universe, if it is to be regarded as intelligible, must be viewed as the expression of mind. Religion is in some ways akin to science, it is pointed out; but in other ways it is more like art. In making assertions about the Whole and claiming to be knowledge of the truth, it is allied to science; but inasmuch as the truth it claims to know is primarily concerned with the quality of reality rather than with quantitative relations, which constitute the realm of science, religion is akin to art and may legitimately enough, after the manner of art, make use of myth as one of its vehicles of expression. Canon Streeter makes a distinction between what he calls two ways of knowledge-the classifying, analytical law-formulating method of sci- ence; and a more direct, intuitive way, which he thinks must be used to supplement the results of the other method. Particularly when the phe- nomena we are dealing with are those of life and consciousness, is an an- thropomorphically interpretative intuition called for. But while reli- gion always starts with the method of anthropomorphic intuition, we must check the results reached in this way by constant reference to facts and laws of the scientific order, if degeneration into superstition is to be avoided. Following out this program, with acknowledged obligations to Berg- son, Dr. Streeter finds his basic metaphysical working hypothesis in the view that life, in the sense of conscious life, is the fundamental element in reality, and then proceeds to examine his hypothesis in the light of facts as he understands them. The hypothesis of a cosmic life-force will explain everything materialism tried to explain, and more also, he claims.

But, mechanomorphism aside, the creative principle we posit is not necessarily to be thought of as a blindly groping life-force, such as the unconscious life of vegetable organisms seems to be. It may well be that ultimate reality is less truly thought of as theriomorphic than as anthropomorphic. The only plausible argument for the former alternative is that which appeals to the fact of evil, and this is a consideration which must be dealt with. The author anticipates, however, that ethical monotheism or the "higher anthropomorphism," as he calls it, will be found to be a more satisfactory view than either the vitalistic hypothesis of an impersonal life-force or the idealistic concep- tion of a static absolute or all-creating thought, of which contrasted posi- tions it is, in a sense and to a certain extent, the "higher synthesis." The somewhat abstract intellectualism of the classical Idealism makes its world-view seem a trifle jejune beside a vivid Life-Force conception like that of Bergson; but its demonstration that it is a necessity of thought to postulate an ultimate Intelligence makes it a most valuable complement to and correc- tive of, his philosophy. For this demonstration entirely disposes of the possi- bility left open by Bergson, that the Life-Force may be only a purblind grop- ing monster, a mere Will to live, at best half-conscious of its aims. If, then, we can correlate the principles for which Bergson and the Idealists respectively argue, in such a way that these will no longer conflict with but supplement one another, we reach a conception of the Universe as the expression of Desire and Will--but rational Desire and intelligently directed Will. Idealist philosophy has at times seemed to point us to a conception of the Reality behind Appear- ances as an Absolute of which nothing but negatives can be predicated-- changeless, colourless, motionless, feelingless, and therefore, for all that is ar- gued to the contrary, really dead. Creative Evolution on the other hand, pic- tures a Universe really alive, but leaves us wondering how far the lan vital is, or is not, more than an aimless Will to live. Combine the two conceptions, and we are on the verge of that splendid concrete vision of the ancient Hebrew prophets-a Living God [pp. I32-331]. As preliminary to taking up the problem of evil Dr. Streeter defends the Christian ethical ideal, as he understands it, in opposition to the eth- ics of Nietzsche. It is Nietzsche's ideal morality, not Christ's, which should bear the name of a "slave morality"; the will to power "represents the slave's dream of how he would behave if only he were free; it is the expression, not of greatness, but of a neurotic desire for greatness. The true expression of the freeman's temper is the princely motto---Ich Dien 'I am in the midst of you as he that serves.' " The will to pleasure and the will to power are rightly to be subordinated to the will to righteous- ness and the will to service.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS I49 The chapter entitled "The Defeat of Evil" contains much that is suggestive and valuable. Great stress is rightly laid upon the uniformity of nature as a sine qua non of any consistent action. Attention is also called to the fact that life in nature and in man has a curative as well as a creative aspect, and the question of the retrieval of moral failure should be considered, it is suggested, with this fact in mind. "Repentance is in itself an evidence of a moral advance already actually achieved. Its smart is the smart of 'growing pains.' " Initially considered, pain is useful as a warning of Danger or a spur to activity, but beyond the limited amount required for these purposes it is not ordinarily beneficial. However, when, as in the case of Christ, suffering is unavoidably encountered as a part of what is involved in the way of life required for the realization of a high ideal, the consequences of sufferings can be ennobling to the sufferer and an inspiration to others. A world in which suffering and sin are possibilities is a world better worth creating than one in which everything was automatic, smooth and easy. With- out freewill goodness, without risk, courage could not exist; freewill involves the possibility of sin, risk that of disaster [p. 246]. There are many wise observations also in the chapter on "Religion and the New Psychology." The problem of the bearing of the new psy- chology on religion is rightly seen to be ultimately a philosophical and not a purely scientific one. If belief in the existence of God is philosophi- cally defensible, the problem comes to be simply a new form of the old question of the relation of divine activity to the reign of law which was raised by the discoveries of Newton and again by those of Darwin. The general tendency of religion wherever it has come strongly under the in- fluence of science, has been to look for the divine in the rational and the ideal, rather than in the irrational. One of the questions particularly considered is that of the relation of the psychology of "projection" to the validity of the idea of God. While admitting that pathological symptoms sometimes accompany religious genius, as they may accompany genius in any other of its expressions, Streeter explains this by pointing out that genius "involves a more than ordinary sensitiveness to impressions. A razor is more easily notched than an axe, and enhanced sensitiveness cannot but be accompanied by in- creased liability to injury." But religion is a phenomenon characteristic of health, rather than of disease. Conversion is a movement away from dissociation toward integration of personality. While neurosis in religion may account for fanaticism, it cannot account for insight.</page><page sequence="4">150 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION If God is "our Heavenly Father," then the right reaction towards Him must be analogous to that of a child towards its father; with the all-important proviso that we mean the reaction of a psychologically healthy child towards a good and sensible father, and not the pathological reaction known as a "fa- ther-complex" [p. 267]. Other topics discussed are prayer and auto-suggestion, intercession and telepathy, and the idea of immortality. If it is true that God exists, it matters little, it is pointed out, whether we use the term "auto-sug- gestion" or some other for the psychological mechanism by means of which this true belief is made effective below the merely surface con- sciousness. Telepathy (accepted by Dr. Streeter as a fact on the ground that it is the only reasonable alternative to spirit-communication as an interpretation of certain phenomena of psychical research) may be, it is held, a means which God uses to realize his purposes, and it may be that he can use it more effectively when we pray for others than when we do not. But intercessory prayer is addressed to God, and is not to be re- garded as a mere attempt on our part to make use of telepathy. With regard to immortality, the conclusive consideration for the believer in the God of Jesus Christ is that it is inconceivable that such a God should permit his children, whom he loves, to perish. Canon Streeter is not a professor of metaphysics, but in the opinion of the present reviewer he has succeeded much better in the difficult task of metaphysics than many of the professional philosophers of the day, and this chiefly for the reason that he regards both religious experience and science as sources of knowledge of the nature of reality and develops his theory accordingly. There are, no doubt, a number of minor criti- cisms which might be suggested; but perhaps the most serious objection which can be brought with justice against the work as a whole is that the philosophical structure it raises is rather loose-jointed; it hangs together, but some parts of it are a little too shaky for solid comfort. It is incon- clusive; its case is not completely proved. But this much, I doubt not, the author himself would admit; and is it anything more than what is to be expected of a theory of the nature of ultimate reality in the present un- settled condition of science and with the still very incompletely developed possibilities of religion? As it is, metaphysical systems of the type repre- sented by Canon Streeter-and he is not the only one who is working along these same general lines-compare very favorably with the possible alternatives, which seem to bethree: materialism, or its practical equiv- alent; an anti-metaphysical and agnostic positivism; and a speculative metaphysics, generally idealistic, which claims to demonstrate a spiritu- ally satisfactory world-view, but which turns out, on critical examination, to be ambiguous in its meaning or fallacious in its arguments, or both.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK RE VIEWS 151 We should like to see a frank admission on the part of leading profession- al philosophers of the value of such a religious theory of reality as this of Streeter's considered merely as a metaphysical hypothesis; but any hope for such an expression of approval would probably, for the near future, be doomed to disappointment. Modern philosophy, in its professional as- pect, is still pretty generally committed to the attempt to solve its prob- lems without any recognition of the value of religious experience, even at its best, as a source of metaphysical insight.
