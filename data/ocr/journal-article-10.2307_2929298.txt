<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERNARD DORT Are These Novels "Innocent"? Clearly, ever since Balzac the novel has been obsessed with the idea of its own totality. Yet, ever since Balzac, it has fallen short of totality. The novel's entire history is, as a consequence, one long defeat. Balzac's own works are laden with all the contradictions that in the long run will wreck the novel and make of it that ever battered ruin, undermined from within, which Robert Musil evokes for us in The Man Without Qualities. Although it had been Balzac's intention to depict a world on the point of fulfillment beneath the conjoined emblems of Monarchy and Religion, all he could actually offer was a world falling to pieces under the concerted assault of property and money. At the pinnacle of his Tower of Babel the King should have sat enthroned, God's delegate on earth. But this pinnacle never comes into view, and the Comedie Humaine recounts only the building of the Tower and the chaotic efforts of its builders. In place of a consecrated world is only this world at labor and in labor. Instead of a harmonious gradation of functions we witness the brutal clash of opposing forces, instead of sabbath peace we are confronted by the angry workaday din. Since those days the novel has spoken to us less of building than of demolition. The great novels of 1900 to 1950 take for their theme the erosion of a world, and their own destruction also. They are autos-da-fe in a fictional guise. The novel as a literary genre has never succeeded in resolving its contradictions. For it is the bourgeoisie's very own genre, the ex- pression of a social class that has never really established and legitimized its power. Where Shakespeare succeeded, Balzac failed. He could not con- secrate bourgeois power, which was a perpetual calling-into-question, a class struggle inside the class to seize hold of the power it exercised. No bourgeois novelist could create the image of a static, eternal world. The Divine Comedy eludes him. He must fall back on the Com&amp;die Humaine, which is the panorama of this calling-into- question. Then he examines this questioning and after that he consumes himself. Today's novelist is still a bourgeois. But he can no longer believe in the mission of the bourgeoisie, and he has found no faith to replace it. His audience, too, consists of bourgeois who have lost faith in themselves, in their power, and in the universality of their power. Thus their status is essentially a negative one. As a result 22</page><page sequence="2">BERNARD DORT two kinds of novel are being written. The greater number, scarcely to be classed as literature, act as though this minus were a plus sign-they are plaster-facade novels, stylistically Stendhalian, the products of a faked bourgeois nature-of-man. The others, which alone concern us, take the minus to be a minus, and in a double sense they are novels of bourgeois decadence, for they both share in and accelerate this decadence. As they display it to us, they also display themselves participating in it and so denounce it. To make of decadence the impulse propelling the novel inevitably leads either to abandonment of the project (I am thinking of Musil) or to silence (I am thinking of Beckett or, on another plane, of Broch with his Death of Virgil). The lesson is hammered in by practically half a century of the history of the novel. Yet a bond survives between these novelists of decadence and their public (made up of isolated individuals, to match these writers of solitude). This is the sense of communion of bourgeois severed from their class, by their own doing or otherwise, and who refuse, consciously or unwittingly, the de facto power still wielded by the class. Having no future beyond this severance, they continually relive it, burrow into it and inter the world within it. Thus their negativity ceases to be real and becomes imaginary. First it had exercised itself against bourgeois values; then it took umbrage at value, however this was conceived; now it has turned against reality, the world, and finally against literature, which is to say against itself. Hence the preeminence accorded in such novels to the artist who, -more than mere hero, becomes the novel's theme. Hence today's culmination: Beckett or Genet. A literature of silence. Or a litera- ture of display, a juggling with masks and phrases. One further step, and we find our novelists of refusal. A whole lit- erary school. Or, rather, three classes of novels which may be grouped as follows: Novels of self-devourment, or literature as expounded by Maurice Blanchot, a literature of "why literature?" Antenovels which, for Butor, "tend naturally and should tend toward their own exegesis," for Nathalie Sarraute should be, to the cinema, what contemporary painting is to photography, for Jean Cayrol would constitute an apprenticeship in novel- writing; Novels of thereness which, according to Robbe-Grillet, "show us, by the sole intermediary of the optic descriptive adjective, which restricts itself to situating, limiting and defining, the dif- ficult path to a new art of the novel." 23</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies Only one ambition is common to all these novels. They all reject a priori meanings (in particular, that human nature we now realize to be so intensely bourgeois). One weapon is utilized by all: that of descriptive formalism. Joyce and Musil did not banish meanings. Anything but. They piled one meaning on the other so that in the end these might exter- minate each other. They did not repudiate the idea of a totality. Anything but. But their totality had a minus sign. It was indeed an addition of the greatest possible number of meanings, but the total always tended to zero. Robbe-Grillet intends to stick to zero. Description is raised to the rank of the basis technique for the novel. With Nathalie Sarraute, it is the description of infrapsychological tremors; whereas Robbe- Grillet adhers to "objectal" descriptions. It is the description, in either case, of atoms cut out of the world, out of experienced totality. "Objectal" and "objective" must be distinguished. The former adheres to objects, to things, as they reveal themselves when seen from outside, seized by an external gaze (no, not "seized," we had better say "traversed"). But "objective" is what is, the totality of all that is, that is to say the world and the novelist apprehended in a global intuition. The objective is Balzac's dream, is Hegelian reality. The objectal is simply a working hypothesis, a laboratory specimen. Robbe-Grillet is too much inclined to confuse the two concepts. Or he should roundly assert the identity of objective and objectal-which would be a clear option in favor of a meaning. What our novelists are aiming at is, then, to conjure up or rather to obtain recognition for a new reality-which hitherto had been masked by what Robbe-Grillet calls the "myths of profundity" or what Roland Barthes refers to as bourgeois mythologies. This is fine, nothing could be more necessary and more salutary. But the little matters of "why" and "how" still require elucidation. This is where misunderstanding sets in, separating our novelists and their critics, these critics and the public, even the novelists from their own novels. Robbe-Grillet's case is, I believe, the most representative, to the extent that he envisages himself as novelist and also as theore- tician of the new novel. His art, he assures us, aims only at restoring "the thereness of things," and he goes on to assert that the world quite simply is and that the future hero will be there, while com- mentaries will remain elsewhere. This brings to mind Francis Ponge, for he too had taken the side of things. But in Ponge this attitude, far from seeking to remain non-significant, was (and still is?) resolutely committed. The side he took was the world of tomorrow, with its reconciliation between men and things, against a divided world, the capitalist world of today. There is nothing of the sort to be found in Robbe-Grillet. Things 24</page><page sequence="4">BERNARD DORT do not herald man. They limit him. They catch him in their trap. Thus Robbe-Grillet's novels (including La Jalousie) offer us the direct opposite of his theories. In them, thereness is only the in- dication of man's personal drama, of the conflict between his guilt and his innocence. More than that: he is tragedy. A fissure in the unity of the universe. A malediction. The even surface of Robbe- Grillet's space is torn apart; his uniform, mathematical time is dis- turbed, as it were, by a maelstrom, the "objectality" of his universe swings over to subjectivity, to the pure phantasm of a hero whose presence is all the more constraining for having been left a blank. (See La Jalousie, whose central character never appears.) In the world as Robbe-Grillet sees it there is no objectivity left, one switches without any transition from objectality to subjectivity. This telescoping of opposites into one another is unavoidable, given the premise that description is to be regarded as the sole permissible technique. As George Lukacs had already noted in his Erzadhen oder Beschreiben, which dates from 1936, description is bound to end up as naturalism or as symbolism. It never leads to realism. It transforms the world into a "still life," and nothing can prevent the reader's appropriating this still life, this reality which is only appear- ance, and treating it as a symbol into which he can pour all the meanings that exist for him personally. The success currently enjoyed by our "new novelists" is evidence of this very phenomenon. The reading public, this cultivated bourgeois public ideologically though not economically at odds with their own class, have recognized themselves, not in Robbe-Grillet's or Butor's heroes, who have been erased, so to speak, but in their world. They have recognized this non-signifying literature as their own. And they have endowed it with a significance, not as the discovery of a new realism but as the construction of a partial world cut off from the totality of history, a universe on holiday which can evade the clutches of time and the movement of History. How well we realize it! The French bourgeoisie of our day fears History. Fears its generals. Fears the Popular Front. It even fears time as it slips by. Shut up within its idiosyncratic activities, it has no longer any desire to see what view of the world they have to offer. Its only worries concern the weekend, the holidays, the frigi- daire or the Dauphine. It is impossible to avoid associating this self-willed blindness and incarceration, this need to live in a rigorously aseptic present, accom- panied by a few objects as "modern" as they are utilitarian, with the procedure of our novelists as they set up their little closed worlds where time turns in a circle and where objects and men exchange their qualities, the gaze acting as sole intermediary. Barthes has no trouble in discovering a "literature of decondition- 25</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies ing" in Robbe-Grillet's novels, "a deconditioning of the reader with respect to the essentialist art of the bourgeois novel," and it is all too true that today the sign system of the bourgeois novel and also its form (in the widest sense of the word, namely its vocabulary) are irremediably outdated. But can the desired deconditioning be achieved via a purely optical description which "frees objects from their human significance and corrects them of metaphor and anthropomorphism . . . which sets up nothing or, rather, which sets up the veritable human nothingness of the object, which acts like an icy cloud which hides nothingness and thereby points to it"? I do not think so, and believe rather that this deconditioning has already taken place, having been brought about by the whole body of fiction published in the first half of the 20th century. It would be more appropriate to speak, today, of a reconditioning. These purely optical descriptions, quite on the contrary, maintain a literary order which was that of the 19th century, of the Romantic writers. To make the declaration that "the romantic heart of things" has been abolished, while at the same time rejecting their function as utensils (their "dialectical sweat," as Maurice Regnant has called it), is to extend the sway of Romanticism over all the universe now constituted an alien world under the malediction of some nameless destiny-and this is the very world of tragedy, but devoid of any catharsis. The only other course for RobbeGrillet would be to evacuate man entirely from his novels (since this man is constantly initiating a reversal of perspectives) and to construct them as a block of things, objects utterly foreign to man and among which he would have no place, where not even a blank would be left for him. But would that be an evasion of Romanticism, or a whole-hearted adop- tion of it? For, while every novel contains a contradiction, while the novel-unlike the epic-is built up on contradictions, every great novel far from hiding them gives them free rein and develops itself in the process (at the risk of failure). Our novelists are much more inclined to disguise and veil them, to direct our and their own atten- tion elsewhere, so metamorphosizing their works into imaginary objects, as useless as they are successful. Here is one example from a related domain, the theatre. It is certain that, to begin with, Beckett, Ionesco and Adamov were inspired by the same desire of deconditioning the theatre. An end to the "lacework of plot and dialogue," what mattered was to re- discover a pure theatre, a naked theatre, a theatre of immediacy. What is the situation today? Enclosed in his negativity, the prey of his own silence, with his Endgame Beckett has given us only a pathetic parody of Waiting for Godot. But there is one important 26</page><page sequence="6">BERNARD DORT difference: the non-significance of Godot has been followed by the multiple significance of Endgame. As for lonesco, after having offered a remarkable exercise in the self-demystification of (bour- geois) language in The Bald Soprano and The Chairs, he is now tempted by a theatre that mystifies-the theatre of the eternal myths. Adamov alone has emerged from the world in which the objectal yields to the subjective, non-significance to multiple significance and parody to tragedy. Not that he has broken with his earlier works- I see no conversion here-but he has drawn all the consequences and, instead of pulling them around himself, he has tried to open them up to the world, and to History, by once more inserting them in this reality. Refusal is a Romantic attitude. So it need cause no surprise that a piece of writing by Robbe-Grillet, for instance La Plage, should strike us as specifically Romantic and that we should find in it all that goes to make up a Romantic Weltanschauung: a man battling the elements, and his futile wanderings in a world both changing and eternal, but which is no concern of his. Yet it would not at all shock me if Robbe-Grillet should seize every occasion to proclaim his adherence to the opposite, namely Realism. Our bourgeoisie is Romantic, once again, when it can find no possibility but refusal, being unwilling to pay the price of a war it does not want to call war and baptizes "pacification," and turning a blind eye to tortures which are nevertheless a regular feature of that pacification. It is Romantic, but ashamedly Romantic, when it denies the exigencies of History but lacks the courage to affirm atemporal values. So all that is left our bourgeoisie is the Salon of Domestic Arts: a privileged site where beauty and utility appear to be reconciled, the site of an eternal present, of a fresh and perfect innocence. Is there a possibility that Robbe-Grillet might one day become a writer for the Salon of Domestic Arts? We must return to a distinction made above. Neglecting what we have called novels of self-devourment-since they exemplify, with greater or lesser brilliance, the style of yesterday-only the ante- novels and the novels of thereness need concern us. For undoubtedly the novel of tomorrow will take shape for or against them, scarcely through them. Here it is that the procedure of a Cayrol, for example, is clearly marked off from Robbe-Grillet's: they start with much the same material but arrive at highly divergent conclusions. It would be more precise to say that literature, as viewed by Robbe-Grillet, finally constitutes an atemporal and thus eternal universe which may represent equally well either a totally objectal universe or a purely subjective fantasy, whereas literature as practised by Cayrol has no 27</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies finality. The latter type, consequently, remains open-but the former is hermetically sealed, there is no exit. Robbe-Grillet's novels attain their limit in their rhetoric, the very indeterminacy of Cayrol's in- augurates a future. Robbe-Grillet has indeed a system, and a coherent one, more readily discoverable in his fiction than in his theoretical pronounce- ments. In it each pole shuttles us to its own opposite, while the pat- tern itself remains fragmentary and self-enclosed. Thus his novels demonstrate the impossibility of reflecting the world in any way except via its debris, each fragment being molecular in structure and perfectly formed but neither constituting a whole nor having the capacity to do so. Robbe-Grillet has created significant parts which, while evoking no global significance, make it impossible, and so refer us to the impossibility of signifying, which in itself is highly significant. It is opportune to reverse the terms of what we came to realize at the beginning of this paper. Balzac's achievement, it was stated, set out from an ideal image of the world and represented the writer's endeavor to conjure up this total image and provide the reader with a fully rounded totality more real than the real world. Today, any such totalitarian vision could only be a lie. We live, and are aware that we live, in a world of half-lies and semi-truths. But the actual idea of totality is not demolished thereby. It is simply postponed until later, it will be dealt with subsequently. Perhaps, then, the novel must become an adventure once more, before it can reach fulfillment in the epic. The necessity of a certain formalism should not be equated with a dangerous kind of rhetoric. Formalism, as Michel Butor has re- marked,' "far from opposing realism, as a short-term criticism too readily imagines, is the prerequisite for a more advanced realism." It is the deconditioning of previous forms overladen with acquired meanings. Rhetoric is the anticipation of meanings as yet undis- covered, or it is the desire for meaning, or it is the refusal to mean. Today's fiction is double-edged, it is both rupture and recondi- tioning. It is formalism, and realism also. There can be no escape from this double impulse, except at the cost of establishing a mere rhetoric. This is not preaching an unlimited reliance on inspiration, it amounts to evaluating and welcoming every sort of inspiration. In particular, it stresses the need to abstain from concluding. The danger menacing Robbe-Grillet is, consequently, Robbe- Grilletism; Butor, for his part, is threatened by his mythology of culture, Cayrol by his Franciscanism and Nathalie Sarraute by her 1 Cahiers du Sud, No. 334, "Le Roman comme recherche." 28</page><page sequence="8">BERNARD DORT infrapsychology. Their trump card is the fictional forms they employ. Fictional totality is situated no longer at the origin of the work but at the end. The novel no longer arises from it, it is the region where the novel might and should reach its culmination. Our nov- elists have the choice of rejecting it out of hand, thereby condemning themselves to reflect only a fragmented world, or of accepting it and of displaying a world making itself anew while, at the same time, it sloughs off its old skins. What dilemma could be more false than that which, in the wake of Elsa Triolet, Robbe-Grillet poses between an art that, continuing to exist as art, continues to be the most important thing in the world for the artist, and an art of mere efficacity, placed at the service of a cause (revolutionary though this may be).2 I am unable to distin- guish between an art that is pure art and an art the instrument of some cause or other, since the former is never anything but an instrument for the preservation of the established order, a blind "Gyes" to all that is. It is the task of our day to move beyond refusal to criticism, and beyond criticism to the construction of a new order. Neither the bourgeoisie nor the French proletariat appears ready to set about it. Must the same be said of their writers, split between commitment, irresponsibility and orthodoxy? I shall end, without concluding, by citing a single example. The work of Bert Brecht, whose highly rigorous formalism proceeds to a reconnoitering of the world and all its contradictions, is itself the very instrument of this reconnoitering.
