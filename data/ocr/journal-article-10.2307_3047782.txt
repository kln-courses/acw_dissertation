Francesco di Giorgio (1439-1501) is unique among fifteenth century architectural theorists for having re- corded the mathematical procedures he used in design- ing a building. His writings contain detailed descrip- tions of methods for determining plans, elevations, and volumes.' Francesco's advocacy of a modular system * This article is the result of an investigation begun under Professor Rudolf Wittkower at Harvard University in the summer of x954 in a seminar on Renaissance Architectural Theory. It was delivered as a paper at the Frick Symposium in the spring of x956. I am deeply indebted to Professor Witt- kower for the basic idea as here expressed and to Professor John Coolidge for his valuable criticisms and sustained in- terest. I.

Neither Alberti nor Filarete gave any detailed con- crete information about good proportions or the use of modules although they clearly imply that both the module and good proportions are necessary to archi- tecture.2 All fifteenth century architectural theorists spoke of proportions in terms of mathematics or in terms of the human body, which may mean there were understood methods that architects employed when designing, but no attempt to find such schemes precisely applicable to fifteenth century buildings has been successful. An ex- amination of Francesco di Giorgio's theoretical writings may help to explain the reason since it is possible to de- fine the relationship between his theory and his archi- tectural practice. Francesco describes several methods of obtaining modules and proportions,8 but the most interesting is the anthropomorphically derived modular grid in which the proportions of the human body are used to deter- mine a temple plan (Figs. I, 2).' The head or the face is the fundamental unit and the divided body in- dicates the location of the major features in the plan of the building. Proportions of a faqade are also de- rived from the human body (Fig. 3).6 Intersecting circles are superimposed on a grid generated by using the height of the head as the module. Francesco devotes an entire chapter to the derivation of the proportions of temples from those of a man which he illustrates with two examples. The seriousness of his intentions can be seen in the modest statement which prefaces this section. "... . finding many varied opinions exist about this body I have determined something which I will demonstrate briefly."" The two drawings (Figs. I, 2) represent two different ways of dividing the human body. One system is the seven-head height, the other, the nine-and-a-third-face height. The seven module division (Fig. i) produces a longitudinal church plan with a dome diameter equal to the width of the church. A double module gives the diameter of the apse. In a more detailed explanation of the nine- and-a-third-module division (Fig. 2), Francesco notes that a circle touching the nose and bottom of the torso ".. . will give the width of the temple," and the dis- tance from the nose "... to the crown of the head ... will give the diameter of the hemicycles" which sur- round the domed area.' In a like manner the location of the elements of the plan are outlined according to the anthropomorphic concept. The two methods represent different and, therefore, flexible canons of proportion since a comparative ex- amination shows relative parts of the body to be un- equal. For example, if we assume the body to be 5' 10o" tall, the head in the seven-part division would be ten inches. This same body in the nine-and-a-third-part breakdown would have a head longer by I 4 inches, roughly the distance from the lips to the nose-a sig- nificant change of proportion in any head! It is the system and not the body that determines the propor- tions. Francesco, like Procrustes, stretches or amputates (note the feet of the nine-and-a-third division) the human figure to conform to his abstractly conceived bed of modules.s Is not this method merely a sophisti- cated combination of mediaeval geometry with Ren- aissance arithmetic, adapting the prevailing geometrical method so ably illustrated in Villard de Honnecourt's sketchbook? The anthropomorphic approach is also used to deter- mine the proportions and articulation of a fagade (Fig. 3)V. Francesco's drawing of the fagade is accompanied Italy by Carlo Promis in Turin in 1841 simultaneously with an extract that contained the Vita di Francesco di Giorgio Martini, the Trattato, and the Atlas, but not the military his- tory. Page numbers used here are from the shorter version. 2. Alberti makes his recommendations for proportions and ratios in a very matter-of-fact way. He suggests that the height to width ratio of a door be z2:i or the square root of 2:i (L. B. Alberti, Ten Books on Architecture, Bartoli translation, Leoni edition, London, 1755, Bk. I, Ch. xii), or that in a room "if the length be five times the breadth, make the height the same as where it is four times, only with the addition of one sixth part of that height" (Ix, iii). The implication of a modular system is explicit in the demand for "regularity . . . size and situation equality . . ." (IX, viii). Further evidence of a similar nature can be found in vI, ii; ix, ix. 3. For Francesco, modules seem to be units of measure large enough to be used for the basic ordering of a building. Modules are obtained in three different ways. By the first, or arithmetical method (Trattato, Bk. II, Ch. 2, p. 39), a story is divided vertically into a number of equal divisions in which cornices, string courses, windows, and doors are allotted a predetermined number of parts. The method involves only an arithmetical proportional division. The second, or geometrical method, found in both the second and fourth books, uses a construction to find a unit for a modular grid (Trattato, II, 9, PP. 59, 6o; IV, 3, pp. io6-io8). The constructions are of two different types. One type, used to determine the proportions of a room, utilizes two perfect figures (a circle inscribed in a square), and determines a module that is a portion of the radius which is roughly commensurable with the side of the square. This type of construction is also used in the often re- produced drawing of a facade-section for a domed building. The other type of construction utilizes the diagonal of the square (square root of 2) and the diagonal of the double square (square root of 5) to establish an approximate relation between the diagonals and the side of the square. The drawings are attempts to find by a simple mediaeval geometrical con- struction a non-empiric Renaissance module which may be used arithmetically to approximate ratios and proportions which are incommensurable. The result is a measuring unit of considerable practical value, for it avoids the problem of the relation of the length of a diagonal to the side of a square or the length of the radius of an inscribed circle to the side of the square. 4.

The anthropomorphic view is employed not only in plan but in the design of entablatures (Biblioteca Nazionale, MS II.I.14, fol. 38v), column capitals (ibid., fol. 34v), and columns (ibid., II.1.x4x, fols. 32v, 33r). 9. Trattato, IV, i, contains the textual matter relating to this drawing but Promis does not reproduce the drawing,</page><page sequence="4">NOTES 259 by specific recommendations for determining propor- tions, by what Francesco calls "una colonna imaginata" or human figure applied to the wall." Illustrating a "proportional and geometrical demonstration," Fran- cesco argues that the relative measurements of a fagade for a temple that is either longitudinal or central can be determined by dividing the human body into seven equal parts with the head serving as the measuring unit. The base is given a width of four units. The height of the door is determined by the crossing of the two diagonals, and where the diagonals intersect the next to last grid line "will be the . . . width of the door." Apparently the inscribed circles are useful only in determining the height of the base, which is estab- lished by the intersection of the diagonals and the lower circle."1 Half-unit divisions indicate the location of architrave, frieze, and cornice. One half-unit is arbi- trarily added to the summit "because the head is some- thing superior."l2 This deviation is useful for it gives the rise of the pediment. Even though it is only dia- grammatic, this drawing describes the major features of a fagade rather completely. II The chief problems resident in the application of a theoretical diagram to an actual building are concerned with those matters that are usually left unstated in diagram. For example, there is usually no indication of either wall thickness or wall placement in a theoreti- cal sketch. Should the wall be placed on the outside or on the inside of the grid line? Is a combination of these two indicated for different situations? How thick should the wall be? To what extent is this determined by what the architects thought was structural necessity, i.e., the supposed compressive strength of masonry, the forces at work on the masonry, the size of the building, and to what extent by geometrical calculation? Fortunately, there are in Francesco's manuscripts a few examples of plans that contain grid lines and also show wall thicknesses."1 In several cases the wall is placed with its inside face on the grid line with pilasters projecting from the wall on the opposite side of the grid line." Columns are usually placed on the grid line or centered on the intersection of two lines, as they are on the nine-and-a-third-module height plan.1" Un- fortunately, there is no such drawing extant to aid in the determination of wall thickness or structural nature of a fagade which would enable us to relate it to an actual project. Since the buildings designed in Francesco's Trat- tato are of a different size from those he actually con- structed,"1 some difficulty may be expected in the direct transferal of his theoretical proportions to his extant work. Also, information concerning the attributions of buildings to Francesco di Giorgio and what part he played in them is still inexact." The one building that is attributable to Francesco with some degree of cer- tainty is the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Calcinaio, near Cortona.xs which appears in Bibl. Naz., op.cit., fol. 39v. A reproduction may be found in Stegmann and Geymiiller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, xI, 3, p. 19. A drawing of a similar nature though less geometrical, and probably earlier, can be found in the Codex Saluzziano, Turin, Library of the Duke of Genoa, MS 148, fol. 2 xv. io. Trattato, p. ioi. Si. Francesco states (loc.cit.) that the base height is deter- mined by the intersection of the diagonals and the circles. How- ever, the drawing in the Biblioteca Nazionale, op.cit., here reproduced, shows the base height determined by the inter- section of the circle and the interior vertical grid lines. This is probably an error of the copyist and speaks strongly against Francesco as the author of the drawing. It is unusual that the major intersections of the two circles or the intersections of the circles and the diagonals in the middle region do not establish any significant point. The upper circle serves no function at all. 12. loc.cit. 13. For example, in the Codex Saluzziano, Biblioteca Reale, Turin, fol. iiv, all three plans; fol. x2r, all five plans; fol. 2zv, the plan in the lower center of the folio. 14. For example, in the Codex Saluzziano, fol. i Ir, plan second from the left; fol. i v, plan on the lower right; fol. 2zr, the two full plans; fol. i2v, the plan in the lower center. I5. Also in the Codex Saluzziano, fol. xviv fol. x3r, the two plans in the upper right. 16. Most of the buildings illustrated in the manuscripts are considerably larger, as evidenced by the great number of sup- porting columns, the length of the naves in relation to the transepts, the spacing of the columns, the size of the entrances, and the complex structural nature of the apse and transepts. While it would not be impossible to design structures that make scale determinations difficult (as was so often done in the next century) it is probable that the intercolumniation dis- tances are intended to be governed by structural considerations and thus to determine within certain limits the absolute size of any example. 17. Just what Francesco actually constructed remains some- what mysterious. There is immense difference of opinion in distinguishing his own work from that done after his designs. A. Venturi (Storia dell'arte Italiana, vIII, i, pp. 737-883) would ascribe some thirty buildings or parts of buildings to Francesco, while A. Weller (Francesco di Giorgio, z439- S5oz, Chicago, 1943, pp. I99-21o) lists only six. For a fairly complete bibliography on Francesco's architecture see Sections A, B, and E of bibliography in Weller, op.cit., pp. 4o5ff., or the bibliography in the handsome monograph by Roberto Papini, Francesco di Giorgio architetto, Florence, 1946, II, pp. 267-275. Publications which appeared after Papini's book that should be noted include Giovanni Canestrini, Arte militare meccanica medioevale, Milan, 1945 (?) Mario Salmi, Piero della Francesca e il Palazzo Ducale di Urbino, Florence, 1945; and Mario Salmi, Disegni di Francesco di Giorgio nella Collezione Chigi Saracini, Siena, 1947. 18. The documents that pertain to the church have been assembled in Appendix II of Weller, op.cit., pp. 352-354. The decision to build the votive church in Calcinaio came soon after Easter in 1484 when there were evidences of some mir- aculous happenings. On July 1, 1484, Francesco, who was in Gubbio working for the Duke of Urbino, was paid a certain sum for a drawing and model of the church. In April of the following year Francesco was in Cortona and on the eighth of the month received payment as the designer of the church. Another document mentions Francesco as still in Cortona on April 30, 1485. The church was dedicated in June 1485 and the long account which is preserved in the Cortona archives mentions Francesco by name. What may be a drawing of a church of a similar nature can be found in the Codex Saluz- ziano, fol. 14r, and in the Codex Laurenziano-Ashburnham 361 in the Laurentian Library in Florence on fol. 12v. Fran- cesco died in 15o1 and left the building unfinished. The work</page><page sequence="5">260 THE ART BULLETIN The plan of the building is a standard Latin cross with the nave divided into three equal bays and a choir and transept containing one bay each (Fig. 4). The plan is perfectly symmetrical about the longitudinal axis with the exception of the small sacristy to the south of the apse. The initial impression is one of order and consistency. By placing over Fig. 4 a tracing of the theoretical plan divided anthropomorphically into nine- and-a-third parts (Fig. 2) a correspondence is ob- tained that is too precise to be accidental (Fig. 5). I. The entire building rests within a rectangle of 9 by 6 squares. 2. The transept arms in both of the plans are of the same width. 3. The naves in both plans are of the same width. 4. The circle of the crossing in the Francesco draw- ing corresponds in size to the octagonal dome of the church. 5. The distance from the center line of the nave to the exterior face of the nave wall equals the radius of the dome carried on the ring of columns. 6. The pilaster-wall-grid line relationships are iden- tical to the manuscript plans noted earlier."' The differences are: i. The absence of the side aisles. 2. At the extremities of the arms of the transepts, the walls are inside module lines, rather than outside, but they are consistent in this respect. 3. The dome does not rest on a ring of columns. 4. Asymmetrical sacristy placement. 5. The hemicycle width at the apse indicated by the head is wider than the existing niche. The correspondences are clear in every part except for the one-third-module at the west front.20 Could this mean there were a series of steps leading down which were intended or have since been covered or lost? Or is this another example of Francesco's pro- crustean adaptation? The west elevation of the building presents a fagade that is divided in three vertically. Uniform string course and entablature heights are used throughout the building. The west front is surmounted by a pedi- ment, while the two arms and the apse are covered by a hipped roof. The whole is surmounted by a pointed octagonal dome set on an octagonal drum. When the anthropomorphic design for a fagade ex- amined earlier (Fig. 3) is placed over this fagade the height to width ratio is identical (Fig. 6). The manu- script drawing is for a somewhat smaller church and the door size is, correspondingly, much larger. Ac- cordingly, the architrave, frieze, and cornice in the theoretical drawing occupy far too large a portion of the facade of Santa Maria delle Grazie. However, the regulating lines determine the following: I. The height of the base, which is found at the height of the intersection of the lower circle and the two diagonals as Francesco instructs in the text. 2. The height of the top of the prominent lower string course. 3. The height of the top of the main cornice. Also, the main cornice and frieze together equal one- half module (that allocated to the frieze in the manuscript drawing). 4. The rise of the pediment is exactly one unit. Perhaps the grid determines some of the following also: I. The door is a standard 1:2 ratio but the height and consequently the width may be taken from the diagonal lines. 2. The cornice of the pediment is one-quarter mod- ule high instead of one-half module, but since the entablature of the building is about one-half the size of the one in the manuscript drawing this may be a justifiably noted correspondence. 3. The placement of the circular window may have been intended to coincide with the module line at its lower extremity. If one labored over the point, many more cor- respondences could be alleged. The admittedly variable nature of Francesco's method of design might make such a comparison deceptive and the attempt foolhardy. For instance, the upper circle in the manuscript draw- ing is apparently there only to form a logical whole, and on the faqade it determines nothing. Likewise, at the points where one would expect something to oc- cur--such as at the intersections of the two circles or at the intersections of the circles and the diagonals in the middle region-nothing happens. Although the placing of the circular window, the secondary cornice, and the height of the arch over the doors may not have been determined from such a drawing as this, the cor- respondence of the theoretical drawing and the actual project indicate a very dose relationship. The degree of correspondence is about all that should be expected of Francesco. III The definable correspondence between the architec- tural theory and practice of Francesco di Giorgio gives a clue as to the standard practices of the fifteenth cen- tury. Francesco di Giorgio was certainly not an archi- tect generously endowed with talent, and any indica- tion about his methods should shed light on everyday practice. It cannot be denied that the family of build- ing forms and proportions of the last half of the fif- teenth century indicate some geometrical or mathe- matical method was used in their creation. A great many studies have been made which attempt to show by constructions with right and isosceles triangles, root was carried on after him by Pietro di Domenico who com- pleted the dome in 15 5. 19. See note 14 for manuscript and folio citation. 20. It is this same extra 1/3 module which caused Fran- cesco to alter awkwardly the column spacing in the last bay of the 9 1/3-face height plan. He never knew what to do with the extra 1/3 module, and perhaps it was ignored in this plan.</page><page sequence="6">NOTES 261 triangles, golden sections, etc., how the main propor- tional lines of the building were derived."1 The con- structions usually entail a number of decisions about the placement of the regulating lines, and more often than not there is a conscious fudging of certain parts to make the building fit the rule. Were there distin- guishable ratios, proportions, and geometrical figures used in the buildings? Francesco di Giorgio presents, with his own draw- ings, what may be one solution to the problem. He used a mathematically coherent system in a highly flexible way. While Francesco's procrustean method of adapt- ing the figure to the method indicates little regard for what should be the "perfectly proportioned" human figure, he exhibits an equal disregard for the precise ap- plication of his abstract method to an actual building. The geometrical construction is not superior to the building and serves merely as an aid to determine proportionality. Proportionality becomes something which is dependent at its inception on geometry and arithmetic but final adjustments are made by the eye of the architect and do not depend on the abstract rules of the compass. All other architectural theorists of the century also spoke about mathematical derivations of proportions. There is a general agreement in the fifteenth century that proportions are not created by individual taste but are the result of an envisioned congruency of mathe- matics, music, and the laws of nature itself.22 Archi- tectural harmony derived from mathematics or from the human body would reflect the all-inclusive har- mony of the universe. Did these architects also pay lip service to an intellectual doctrine while in practice re- lying on visual judgment to make final decisions? The flexible way in which Francesco utilizes these immutable relationships may suggest how fifteenth cen- tury architectural writings should be interpreted and may help explain the difficulty in finding consistent, logical systems that were employed by architects. Fran- cesco did not follow his theoretical teachings in a doc- trinaire manner but felt that "although [the facade] owes its height to [the measure of the body] it can be decreased somewhat or increased at the choice of the artisan."28 [HARVARD UNIVERSITY] 2 1.
