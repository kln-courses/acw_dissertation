<plain_text><page sequence="1">gallo, Rubén. Freud's Mexico: Into the Wilds of Psychoanalysis. Cam- bridge, MA: MIT P, 2010. x + 389 pp. Rubén Gallo's study of Mexico's Freud and of Freud's Mexico begins, as the author recounts, at a Mexican museum's exhibition of Freud's collection of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Chinese antiquities. Symptomatically absent, for Gallo, are Freud's Mexican and Latin American artifacts. This omission (or repression) serves as point of departure for the book. Freud's Mexico is divided into two parts, each</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS - 335 containing four chapters and four "free associations." The first part reads a series of Freud-inflected interventions in Mexican art, politics, letters, history, and theol- ogy. The second part, much more speculative in nature, gives the book its title. Here, the reader travels through Freud's own archive - his correspondence, his books, his antiquities, his dreams, his house and city - in search of its Mexican residues. Coleccionista , the book's endeavor, like its subject, because throughout the work we follow Gallo in the accumulation of what the author calls "scant traces," their reunion, their association , always towards an elusive Freudian Mex- ico, in the name of an impossible Mexican Freud. Each chapter grasps, specula- tively, at some close encounter, a possibility, an opening to and of the archive. Unlike Gallo's Mexican Modernity (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005), a book on the material constitution of Mexico's incipient modernity in the first half of the twentieth century, this new study largely invokes the Mexico of Freud - the Mexico of someone who neither lived in nor traveled to Mexico. And this procedure is, in a sense, mutual; the book's encounter with Freud goes beyond the expected scholarly engagement with his thought, productively tarrying with the "wild analysis" of a certain unorthodox reception in Mexico. The book's first part, "Freud in Mexico," already announces an irony that will only completely unveil itself in the text's last "free association," on Freud's missed chance at a Mexican exile following the Anschluss : Freud was never in Mexico. Indeed, the "Freud" who made it to Mexico remains only the name of the author on the texts of the early psychoanalytic movement. Gallo here relates a cultural history of certain key moments of Freud's reception in Mexico and the wild analy- sis that was so often its outcome; one finds the more anticipated readers of Freud treated alongside such unlikely figures as Gregorio Lemercier. The first chapter begins with the lone exception to the "cool" reception of Freud among early- twentieth-century writers and artists, the poet Salvador Novo, and studies Novo's personal archive, reading carefully his marginalia in order to reconstruct this first reading of Freud in Mexico. The second chapter centers on the philosopher Sam- uel Ramos and his deployment of psychoanalysis "to diagnose the collective neuro- ses afflicting the Mexican nation" (57) and reads as symptomatic Ramos's privileging of Freud's "dissident disciple" Alfred Adler over the master himself. The book's third chapter reads Paz's The Labyrinth of Solitude (1950) as a kind of return to Freud, as a kind of Mexican translation of Moses and Monotheism. Part I of the book ends with a chapter on Gregorio Lemercier, whose "monastery in psychoanalysis" - a community that should be understood as part of the radical social and political experiments of the sixties and seventies - opens a space not to merely rethink "Mexicanness," but to transform it by radically "reforming" Mexi- can Catholicism. Part II, "Freud's Mexico," covers an even broader territory. Its first chapter</page><page sequence="3">336 Hispanic review : spring20i2 establishes Freud's own intriguingly "wild" study of the Spanish language with a Vienna boyfriend, Eduard Silberstein; it would become their secret language. In the sixth chapter, on "Freud's Mexican Books" - ironically plural, this title, as we soon learn that Freud only had one - we return to Mexico from Vienna by way of trying to explain the peculiar singularity of Freud's Mexican book, a textbook on Mexican criminal law, Derecho penal mexicano (1937), by Raúl Carrancá y Trujillo, a judge that employed psychoanalysis to elucidate the cases before him - most fascinatingly, that of Trotsky's murderer. It is here that Gallo most directly addresses, with reference to Freud's essay, precisely the question of wild analysis. Wild analysis, writes Gallo, "was practiced by doctors who had never undergone proper training, had little or no experience with the technique of free association, and lacked an understanding of unconscious processes" (207). The next chapter, on "Freud's Mexican Antiquities," returns to the missing objects that have served as the study's desiderata, the three pre-Columbian objects in his collection: a Peru- vian Moche figure, a kneeling figure from West Mexico, and an anthropomorphic idol from the Mezcala region - objects, Gallo suggests, that might have inspired Freud's thinking and writing as he gazed upon them from across his desk. (That this invokes Derrida's Archive Fever [Chicago: Chicago UP, 1995], which contains an "Exergue" that reflects on the force of Freud's archive-domicile, is perhaps another delightful - and symptomatic - manifestation of the book's own fever.) It is the last and, in my opinion, most fascinating chapter, on "Freud's Mexican Dreams," in which Gallo offers his clearest and most compelling theorization and defense of the associative enterprise that organizes not only the chapter but also - it is my sense - the book as a whole. Gallo asks, "Would [Freud] have deemed these interpretations a scholarly form of wild analysis?" (323). The ques- tion is a valid one, considering the almost vertiginously associative logic of the chapter, and also of the book that contains it. But I find Gallo's response convinc- ing: the book is a construction in the psychoanalytic sense - the analyst's suturing together of a series of interpretations, as Gallo puts it, "to arrive at a more complex hypothesis. ... We do not pretend," Gallo cites Freud, "that an individual con- struction is anything more than a conjecture which awaits examination, confirma- tion or rejection. We claim no authority for it." In the end, "Freud believed that only the course of analysis would prove the usefulness of a construction" (323-24). Freud's Mexico opens itself towards its own ultimate consequences, towards the dialogue, the reading, the research, and - let's say it - the continuation of the very "secondary elaboration" ( sekundäre Bearbeitung) that will vouchsafe the "useful- ness" (to use Freud's word) of its intuitions and insights. Gallo has written an engaging study, in a clear and witty style, which will appeal to a diverse group of readers both within and on the edges of academe. It is a playful book, but it is also a serious one. Intensifying the gesture of his previous</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS - 03 337 work, the author points towards a Mexicanism that is comparative and cosmopoli- tan, rigorously archival and adventurously speculative, equally at home in Mexico City and Vienna, open to the world of associations that it will surely provoke.
