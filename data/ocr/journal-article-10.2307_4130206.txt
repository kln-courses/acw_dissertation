Within the system of the divinatory arts in antiquity, physiognomy was the time- honored technique that aimed at inferring an individual character, and his or her past history or future destiny, from the features of his or her body. As such, it constituted a field of subtle expertise based on the elusive nature of sensations, the mutable expressions of the face, and the fleeting reality of gestures. Cicero called such an impalpable ability of judgment sagacia (from sagire, to perceive acutely by the senses), the Arabs firitsa (perspicacity and keen eye). Such was the respect for physiognomy that both lamblichus and Porphyry tell us of how Py- thagoras used to select friends and candidates for pupilage through physiognomic examinations. From Cicero we learn that the physiognomist Zopyrus judging from Socrates' outward appearance did not hesitate to call him stupid and sensual, and ironically, according to Alexander of Aphrodisias, Socrates himself seems to have taken this uncomplimentary diagnosis as evidence that the study of philosophy can in fact modify one's more recalcitrant nature and habits. Anecdotes aside, and metaphysically speaking, physiognomy established a fruit- ful philosophical relationship with Aristotle's hylomorphism by presupposing the existence of a natural resemblance between the body and the soul, unlike the Pythagorean and Platonic principle of the immateriality and unrepresentability of the soul, which was by definition extraneous to both the concept and practice of physiognomy. Agrimi's volume on physiognomy contains preliminary studies that the author was planning to recast into a book dealing with the role of the physiognomist in the complex historical reality of the thirteenth century, an analysis that intended to explore the topic, in accordance with the characteristically interdisciplinary tone of Agrimi's research, in its philosophical, institutional, and social aspects. The reader cannot but regret what has been lost because of the author's unex- pected and premature death. As Agrimi shows in one of the learned essays in the volume, the history of the revival of the physiognomic tradition in the Western Middle Ages was first of all ?

The formation of a set of canoni- cal texts dealing with physiognomy between the twelfth and the thirteenth cen- tury relied largely on the recovery of a series of anonymous and pseudonymous treatises. The first text to be rediscovered at the beginning of the twelfth century was the anonymous De physiognomonia liber, followed by the recovery of the Physio- gnomonia attributed to Aristotle and translated by Bartolomeo da Messina. An- other important acquisition was the pseudo-Aristotelian Secretum secretorum, trans- lated from the Arabic into Latin byJohn of Seville in the mid-twelfth century and by Philip of Tripoli during the first half of the thirteenth. In the Secretum, physio- gnomic observations and the study of characters were presented as a moral and political tool belonging to the art of government. A no less influential component of the physiognomic canon was the section on physiognomy in Rhases' Liber Almansoris, in the translation of Gerard of Cremona (circa 1175). As usual, tex- tual discoveries, translations, and commentaries fostered the production of origi- nal ideas and the establishment of new connections. Influential physiognomic theories can be found in Michael Scot's Liber introductorius (1228-32), Albertus Magnus' Speculum astronomiae (1260-80) and De animalibus (1267-1268), John of Jandun's Quaestiones on the Physics, Peter of Abano's Compilatio physiognomiae (1295), and Michele Savonarola's Speculum phisionomie (1442). The availability of new texts, in addition to triggering new developments in natural philosophy, caused a remarkable re-adjustment within the corpus of scho- lastic disciplines. Agrimi lays particular emphasis on the process of institutionaliza- tion that led physiognomy to be integrated into the encyclopedia of the medieval disciplines. The process was not an easy one, given the diversity of competences required for the practice of physiognomy. It is no accident that the author of the De physiognomonia liber named as the historic masters of physiognomy Loxus the physician, Aristotle the philosopher, and Polemon the orator. By way of these exemplars, the anonymous writer highlighted the three main components of physiognomy: medical semiotics, ontological hylomorphism, and rhetorico-politi- cal techniques of persuasion. The scholastics, being especially concerned to es- tablish a solid foundation for physiognomic skill and connoisseurship, decided to place the pseudo-Aristotelian Physiognomonia between the scientia de astris on the one hand, and Aristotle's scientia de animalibus and scientia de anima (Historia animalium and De anima) on the other. The institutional legitimation of physiog- nomy in the medieval teaching system, however, also demanded a drastic episte- mological and methodological revision. Physiognomy's indirect, presumptive, and conjectural knowledge, based on such imponderable cognitive elements as in- sight, intuition, and instinct, and on weak and flexible argumentative tools like signs, enthymemes, and examples, had to meet the rigorous scholastic standards of causal and demonstrative learning. Whereas Peter of Abano decided to strengthen the foundations of physiognomy by resorting to a powerful synergy of medicine and astrology, emphasizing in particular the contribution of meteorol- ogy and the theory of generation, John of Jandun preferred to restate the advan- tages of the rhetorical and ethical framework. Another crucial step in the process of legitimizing physiognomy, according to Agrimi, was its moral rehabilitation. Given its frequent excursions into the do- mains of magic and necromancy, its successive accretions from the Arabic divina- tory tradition (notorious for its deterministic implications), and its status as a potentially manipulative art, physiognomy had to be transformed, by way of a very</page><page sequence="3">366 BOOK REVIEWS delicate procedure, into a less threatening and less disreputable form of knowl- edge, without discarding its diagnostic, demystifying, and suasive resources. Agri- mi insists on the increasing importance of physiognomic typologies in the course of the thirteenth century and identifies that development as part of a general institutional strategy intended to create social and political order without direct coercion and violence. In addition, Agrimi sees the assimilation of physiognomy both in university and in court settings as a symptom of a radical change in the medieval society of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, involving a greater confidence in the explanatory power of reason and a greater familiarity with the ferine aspects of the human psyche, with the otherness of nature, with animals and monsters, as is well attested by bestiaries, which are "ambiguously suspended between the zoomorphism of the passions and the anthropomorphism of the animals" (p. 44). Physiognomy remained an ability to read into the opaque text of the body, but became in addition a discipline that fostered the secularization of the soul and the naturalization of the passions. Unavoidably, such a shift de- termined a loss of concreteness and immediacy in the experience of the senses. The links with the symbolism of the animal world, with the corporeal aspect of human knowledge, and with the ability to sense nature in intuitive ways were gradually cut. The analytical core of Agrimi's book lies in her dense discussion of the dialec- tical relationship between the tacit expressiveness of nature and the methodologi- cal strategies deployed by the physiognomist in order to interpret the wealth of natural signs and their hidden meaningfulness, and between nature's willingness to unveil its secrets and men's efforts to cover their innermost intentions through simulation and dissimulation. In both cases, physiognomy had to mediate be- tween the effortless truthfulness of nature and men's artful strategies. Located at the intersection of natural and artificial divination, the art of physiognomy was constantly confronted with the difficult task of bringing nature's immediate cau- sality and productiveness (whether one is dealing with astral influences, facial expressions, or cosmic signatures) to the level of logical and linguistic significa- tion. The book of the body, the epitome of the book of nature, was supposed to be written in a natural language based on the natural link between passions and physical expressions, a link reinforced by habits and customs. Physiognomy is a form of knowledge that paradoxically can never be reduced entirely to a techne because it is an expression of the innermost life of nature. It takes a striking erudition and an esprit de finesse-precisely the same finesse that underpins physiognomy itself-to move with agility and competence in such an intricate maze of sources and documents, with problems of attribution and complicated textual lineages of receptions, translations, exchanges, and over- lappings. The essays in this volume give readers only an inkling of the complex project Agrimi was working on, but they manage in any case to conjure up a fas- cinating topography of interconnected discursive traditions: theories of reproduc- tion and theories of gender difference, biological environmentalism and astro- logical doctrines, pathological examinations a capite ad calcem, zoology and comparative anatomy, moralizing bestiaries and ethical characterology, biography and portrait painting.
