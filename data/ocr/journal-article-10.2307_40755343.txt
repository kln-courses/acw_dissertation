<plain_text><page sequence="1">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg William Solomon I pose you your question: shall you uncover honey / where maggots are? I hunt among stones -Charles Olson, "The Kingfishers" In Do These Bones Live (1941), his eccentric critical history of American and European literature, Edward Dahlberg praises Randolph Bourne as a prophetic guide whose subversive writings retain the potential to lead the nation out of the political and cultural wilderness into which it had stumbled. "Bourne conceived such homely and radiantly mortal errors; this was his desperado impossibilism, and for this we remember him. We recall him to guide us ... through the infernal limbo of American culture." A fierce social critic who fell out of favor when he protested American involvement in the First World War, Bourne's dissenting opinions had caused him, however, by the end of the 1930s to suffer the "grim and rep- etitious fate" of other equally committed radical intellectuals. He too now "lies in oblivion . . . unknown," his decidedly marginal writings buried beneath the highly esteemed "canonical death monuments" of more re- spectable political figures. "The power of the State lies in the majesty of oblivion, in crypts, catafalques and mausoleums. The vaults which the remains of the Presidents, those sacral ciphers of public chronicles lie, evoke no tears and laments." One will have to dig deeply to catch sight of those unseemly yet impassioned creatures responsible for the nation's tra- dition of populist radical culture, a powerfully moving tradition whose existence is hidden by "bureaucratic commemoration odes." It is below the magnificently constructed resting places of our past leaders that one encounters the challenging, assertive writings of those who have become as far as official history is concerned as frighteningly repugnant and un- bearable to look at as a dreadful mythological entity, "as horrible to behold as Medusa."1 More than a half century later, it is Dahlberg who now "lies in oblivion . . . unknown."

Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="2">390 William Solomon criticism infrequently discussed, Dahlberg's decaying corpus has been deeply interred in the graveyard of American literary prose. Save for a brief resurgence of interest in his work upon the publication of Because I Was Flesh (1964),2 a resurrected version of the autobiographical materials he used in his first two autobiographical fictions, Dahlberg's Depression- era writing has received minimal scholarly and critical care. The burden of this essay, then, is to determine what have we lost by turning our backs upon the creative and critical output of this peculiarly grotesque writer, one whose work may prove to be "as horrible to behold as Medusa/' The excavation of a portion of Dahlberg's corpus from its relatively unmarked place in the ground of literary history3 brings into focus one of the first attempts in this country to formulate theoretically and develop a practice of a grotesque aesthetic suited to the machine age. And an es- sential source of representational /expressive inspiration for him in this regard was the field of what I tend to refer to as carnivalized American public amusements.4 Importantly, Dahlberg's turn to specific amusements for aesthetic guidance had social implications, indicating his connection to members of minority communities, his identification with the marginal persons in whose lives such "vulgar and naïve" amusements played a vital role. It is the forms of commercial entertainment that "[n]ice people . . . shunned" and "condemned" yet that "millions of less pretentious people loved" and "flocked to" that greatly influenced the young novelist. It is out of the world that extends back from silent screen comedy to "the theatre: the barefaced honky-tonk and the waltzes by Waldteufel, slammed out on a mechanical piano," and that includes as well "burlesque, vaude- ville, [and] circuses" that Dahlberg emerged as a writer. Like Mack Sennett before him and Henry Miller and Nathaniel West after him, Dahlberg's artistic point of departure was "the laughter of unrespectable people having a hell of a fine time, laughter as violent and steady and deafening as standing under a waterfall." And it was thus through such amuse- ments that he "tapped in on that great pipeline of horsing and miming which runs back . . . through the fairs of the Middle Ages at least to an- cient Greece."5 My claim then is that Dahlberg, by drawing upon an assortment of mechanized public amusements as support for his radical literary un- dertaking, initiated a cultural project subsequently carried forward (and transformed in the process) by other writers - Miller the outstanding case in point. (And it is hardly surprising that the latter 's autobiographical prose is hardly canonical, often dismissed as crude, obscene, and re- volting.) Dahlberg's rarely remarked status in the history of American literature as a genealogical precursor to a specific cultural trend is per- haps most clearly framed in regard to traditional accounts of the fate of American modernism. One might say that his endeavor marks a partial,</page><page sequence="3">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 391 incomplete break with the priorities and attitudes governing this artistic movement. Auguring the subsequent collapse of the ideological core of modernism (the hierarchical distinction between autonomous or au- thentic art and the falsity and artifice of mass culture),6 his prematurely truncated career as an autobiographical novelist produced two superb texts, Bottom Dogs (1930) and From Flushing to Calvary (1932). While ex- plicitly eschewing nostalgic returns to obsolete pastoral motifs, he made the degraded half of this familiar opposition the ground of his first, moderately politicized social intervention. Though he did not forego the commonplace tactic of gendering public amusement, of attributing femi- nine attributes to the other of literature, he did at least manage to avoid repudiating this other in the name of the integrity and inviolability of the heroic masculine author. As is suggested by his use of the Medusa trope, assimilating the frightening yet fascinating properties conventionally as- sociated with women was a constitutive part of his effort to construct an offensively grotesque practice of the American novel. In sum, he sought to deploy mechanized entertainment and the feminine in conjunction, utilizing these as the pleasurable basis of a comically structured, formally innovative act of resistance against dominant society. But he remained exceptionally ambivalent about the repercussions of his own project, and one observes in all of his early writing the recurrent impulse to reinstall the very distinctions he has himself put at risk. Again and again one finds Dahlberg retreating from the transgressions he re- quired to get his enterprise going, in the end desperately striving to expel an eroticized technology from the sphere of the aesthetic. Thoroughly repulsed by what obviously attracts him, Dahlberg repeatedly sought to put the barriers that he had helped dismantle back in place. His work manifests from this point of view the state of crisis of the male authorial subject in the Depression era, his panicked gestures exhibiting the ex- treme anxiety this subject experienced in the 1930s in relation to the feminine, the machine, and commercial entertainment. Perceiving these alternately as a valuable resource and a dangerous threat to the artistic self, he ultimately fell victim to what Andreas Huyssen has called "the double male fear of technology and woman/'7 Feeling that he was on the verge of being enveloped by a maternal machine, Dahlberg's autobio- graphical protagonists consistently evince an unsuccessful determination to maintain corporeal and psychic coherence by getting rid of the loath- some, dreadful presences that have made their way inside. It is this complex mesh of aesthetics, sexuality, and mechanization in the context of a dissident literary undertaking that to my mind makes Dahlberg's Depression-era oeuvre a worthwhile object of critical scrutiny. With this goal in mind it will be helpful to start by registering the rigidly inflexible position Dahlberg adopted on such matters at the end of</page><page sequence="4">392 William Solomon the decade after switching from novel writing to literary history. In a section of Bones entitled "Ezekiel's Valley/' he aggressively articulates a now fully developed antipathy to mechanized urban entertainment of several kinds - the cinema in particular - implicitly setting these imita- tive undertakings off from an oral literature devoted to cultivating and augmenting the natural body. The lonely city biped is rifled of flowers, fields, hills, of all spatial mead; chained to the machine, celled in the mechanized room, im- mured in the theoretic sidewalk, street, he stalks his vasty Asias and Indias upon a sieved screen, gazing on dithering, husked heaths, trav- elogue terrains, Himalayas. Denied replete and rondured vistas, he is given instead the bogus "audioscopic" dimension, an interior which is added on to drained, splayed objects, figures, skies, houses; coz- ened of pigments, his thirsts are slaked upon "Technicolor," reds, greens, ambers, spilled, painted on. The automobile, the radio, the ventriloquistic "Talkie," are mechanical anesthesia-horrors which give man all the counterfeit moods of travel, sound, acting, vocal utterance, while insidiously depriving him of motion, energy, act, human speech, animate contact. . . . American civilization is "deanimated," "metronomic," a grotesque enlargement of that "gap between touch and thing."8 (Emphasis his; Dahlberg, 1941, pp. 73-74.) A superficial impression of having conquered space and time belies the modern city dweller's sensory enslavement, his perceptual confinement. By offering cheap, artificial substitutes for genuine experience, techno- logical amusements have robbed him of his proper capacity to expand outward toward the world and other persons. Onanistic filmmakers in- dulge in a wasteful, nonprocreative activity in which fluids are "spilled" or artificially "added onto drained, splayed objects." The deceptive impo- sition of color contributes to the construction of an illusion of spatial depth that replaces the use of art as a means of enlarging persons and bodies through the achievement of contact or copulation with external reality. His desire for movement and expansion gratified by the fake substitutes that the cinema furnishes, the momentarily pleased spectator is further separated from living things - animate entities - than before he entered the theater. Obeying the "first commandment of the manic, machine age" (74), "Thou shalt not touch," "the Human Hand" has "become impotent, maniacal," and is therefore no longer the origin of creative, carefully crafted labor. Guided by "the myth of progress" in the area of commercial entertainment, we have been led "far underground, where we wander over flowerless and treeless plains of macadam, feeding</page><page sequence="5">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 393 upon the ruby leakages of neon lights" (74), our aesthetic sensibilities numbed by the substitution of mechanically reproduced landscapes for nature. However, before staking his claim in the part of the cultural field oc- cupied by aesthetic Luddites, Dahlberg had responded in a much more illuminating manner to the infiltration of cultural practices by machine processes. The firm structural oppositions he employs through Bones be- tween bodies and machines, literature and amusement, orality and writing, nature and technology mark his retreat from the stance he had adopted at the beginning of the Depression era. An initial uncertainty solidified over time into a vehement and absolute repudiation of change. For as he first got his literary career underway, Dahlberg equivocally approved the newer entertainment media, tentatively evincing a willingness to put such tra- ditional categorical distinctions into play and to rethink the relations of the body, consciousness, and literature in the machine age. The complex layering in his first two autobiographical novels of social, cultural and psychosexual anxieties onto twentieth-century entertainment technolo- gies establishes his early writing as a superb point of departure for an inquiry into the political deployment of American amusements. I begin this investigation with "Graphophone Nickelodeon Days," a short piece Dahlberg had intended to include in From Flushing to Calvary (1932) yet ended up publishing separately in 1931 in Pagany magazine. "Graphophone Nickelodeon Days" It went carouselling through his brain . . . He took the evening in the palm of his hands and rubbed his eyelids across it. Dahlberg, "Graphophone Nickelodeon Days" A fictional reminiscence that compresses much of the autobiographical material Dahlberg used in his first two novels, "Graphophone Nickel- odeon Days" takes as its representational point of departure a three-term analogy between mental, literary, and mechanical recording processes. More precisely, the piece implicitly affirms that autobiography, consid- ered as a supplement to memory, may take its formal cues from two relatively recently developed storage technologies. In essence his compo- sitionally experimental discourse aims to achieve the status of a media link between (silent) film and the phonograph. The implication of its title, referring to a type of phonograph9 and to the theatrical venue where early movies were viewed, is that human memory may be conceived of as watching a film while listening to a disc or cylinder playback sounds. The literary text in this sense seeks to approximate the effect of combining aural and optically recorded data. Are the brain, printed words, and the</page><page sequence="6">394 William Solomon mechanical devices the newer media depend on instruments with a com- parable capacity to preserve the sights and sounds of the world? Are they all reliable storage technologies that preserve acoustical and optical events and make them available at a later date? Moreover, the fact that the remembrance in question exceeds the eye and ear and involves the perceiving body in its entirety is apparent in "Graphophone" in that it attempts to reproduce the serial flow of sensory data in the realm of all five of the senses. The aim of the innovative piece is to reproduce the rush of sensations at the level of the gustatory, tactile, olfactory as well as the visual, and aural ("the smelly leaves . . . the gutters of the streets, the wa- ter from the firepump swobbing them - he could never erase them").10 Yet the significance of "Graphophone" is that it develops the nega- tive insight latent in the comparison between literary and technological representation. At the end of the Depression era, in an oft-quoted formu- lation, James Agee seems to support a more externalized version of the analogy in question, affirming, in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, his faith in the representational capacity of the camera as a model for the writer. If handled appropriately, the camera, in "some ways limited, some ways more capable, eye" is, "like the phonograph record . . . incapable of re- cording anything but absolute, dry truth."11 Dahlberg appears to share this conviction and therefore attempts to ground his autobiographical, corporealist aesthetic in the assumption that literature, like the phono- graph and the movie camera, might protect past experiences of the body from dissolution. But as we will see he also unsettles this assumption. Investigating, as did several of his peers, the relation of literature, con- sciousness, and mechanical contrivances, Dahlberg equivocally explores the possibility that new technological amusement apparatuses might function as models for literary and mental reproduction.12 If, as Freidrich Kittler has claimed, it was in the wake of the media revolution beginning in the 1880s that literature was forced to abandon its dream of creating a visible and audible world with words, some writers gave up on such an aesthetic ideology only after experiencing its limits.13 A personal recollection of the pleasures commercial entertainments provided the author during his youth, the highly crafted "Graphophone," as it rapidly unrolls, alludes to a wealth of early twentieth-century cul- tural materials. For the autobiographical protagonist, "it all came back, the taste of it, the tang and brine of it. ... All that he was and could never completely unknow all those down-and-out days went carouselling through his brain ragtiming through his head" (306; spacing in the origi- nal). The fond recollection conveys the essential role amusements played in his everyday life, forming a constitutive element of his existence as a member of a relatively downtrodden social group. The material artifacts mentioned amidst the dizzying rush of memory include lyrics excerpted</page><page sequence="7">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 395 from popular tunes, the sports and political figures once found on the "oblong pasteboard pictures" accompanying the purchase of cigarettes, the "funnies," "penny arcade moving pictures," "slot machine phono- graphs," and a "one cent muscle machine." The character also remembers live forms of entertainment: "the grand opera," "open air tents, lawdie lawdie tabernacle sermons . . . and pimpish gaslight joints" (308). The pe- riod of time the reminiscence covers stretches from the days of the "rough riders" and visits to the "ringling bros." and "barnum and bailey" cir- cuses (313) to 1917, when America entered World War I and "keith's circuit vaudeville [and] slapstick" were still in the air (317). That Dahlberg devotes an entire section of the prose poem to a live performance given by Lew Dockstader's minstrel troupe suggests the lasting impression it must have made on the writer when still a child. Reproducing the comic rou- tine of the opening act, he remarks as well upon the audience's delighted response: as one jokester sings and the other mocks him, the "pulsing and motorthrobbing" crowd becomes frenzied; there are "stampeding . . . feet everywhere," "[t]hick yellow spudblocks of laughter jam the air" (314). Dahlberg then hints that the joys the show furnishes its overly enthused patrons had a politically subversive edge as well, hyperbolically charac- terizing the general impact of its central monologist on the nation as comparable to social and political upheaval. "Lew Dockstader who shook the country like the russian revolution of 1905" (315).14 Immediately after this line, however, Dahlberg begins to put his rep- resentational undertaking into question. For example, the epigraph (from Peer Gynt) to the next section reads '"layers and layers of sensation and no heart in it'" The shifting implication of the internalized museum that Dahlberg employs twice in "Graphophone" also marks the critical turn. Early in the piece the recollected cultural materials are said to have con- stituted for the young protagonist "his boyhood louvre" (312). Whereas here the figure connotes the fascination of the objects the child found around him in the outside world, the later use of the trope frames the psychic return to the material past as the observation of relics on display in a deserted, barren cultural institution: "up the hall of the memory- membrane tissues of the nose, clinking, clinking against the metaphysical corridors and stirring up the museum - desolation in his blood" (316). No longer immersed in the animated world of amusements, the protagonist's mausoleum-like consciousness retains only the unsatisfying idea of the substantial things and persons formerly available for direct sensory con- tact. If the displacement from outside to inside and consequent loss of substantiality is a common motif in narratives of recollection, its presence here nevertheless clarifies the nature of "Graphophone" as an act of mourn- ing. A personal expression of grief in the wake of the separation of the self from the milieu he once found sensual pleasures readily available in, the</page><page sequence="8">396 William Solomon piece also, in a crucial detail, suggestively registers referential absence as an inherent aspect of mechanized reproduction. Having just characterized New York in the 20s as a "syphilitic body" decorated with "jaundiced electric lights diseasing the night," Dahlberg further qualifies the appearance of this object as "a cancerous blurred negative" (318).15 The effect of this last characterization is unsettling in the context of a work predicated on the virtues of positive images as the means of reestablishing contact with an original perceptual experience, of rein- habiting the body. By remarking upon, if only in passing, the stage during which the illusion that the referent is still physically present is tempo- rarily displaced by an encounter with the materiality of the medium, Dahlberg reverses the thrust of his "intermedial"16 analogy. Though ad- hering throughout to the implicit equation between literature, the psyche, and technological recording devices, Dahlberg ends up inverting the sig- nificance of the relationship. In the end what the assorted media (the mind, writing, film, and the phonograph) are shown to have in common is that the traces they preserve all presuppose the disappearance of both the perceiver and the objects it has perceived. The brain, mechanized representation, and writing are like one an- other in that all fail to bring the body and the world it inhabited back to life. Thinking autobiography and memory along the lines of technical processes has the unexpected effect, then, of drawing attention to the me- chanical aspects of the first two processes of recollection. The dialectic whereby the absence of the thing is the precondition of its illusory pres- ence in a representation has been the theme of much critical discourse on the arts in the twentieth century, and "Graphophone" suggests the contri- bution the rise of mechanical amusements made to this development. The writer's practical investment in new entertainment technologies stimu- lated a theoretical awareness of representational problems pertinent to autobiographical literary undertakings. The last feature of "Graphophone" I would like to take up is Dahl- berg's use of oedipal motifs and tropes to account for his altered relation to the field of commercial entertainment over the course of the first two decades of the twentieth century. Early in the prose poem the cheap at- tractions surrounding him both excite and frustrate the child's libidinal impulses. For instance, an optical device gives him a goal without allow- ing him to reach it: "get a peep at venus through the telescope for only a nickel! cheap at half the price but why through a telescope" (307). In the same memory block, desire for the female star of the stage drama "beverly of graustark" plagues the boy at night: "her talcum-powdered lotion- creamed breasts - a long moving picture soul kiss hot tossing nights, her thighs whorling like an electric barber pole: the penny arcade automatic piano jangling away in spasms" (307). The lusts American entertainment</page><page sequence="9">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 397 provoked in the boy at the time are also evident in his memory of one of the women who worked in his mother's barber shop as having "legs [that] were lost in the amusement park grotto of her shroud-black cloth- skirt" (309). The incestuous dimension of the child's erotic passion for older women becomes strongly apparent towards the end of the prose poem. While specifying World War I as the force that destroyed his initial cultural milieu, or rather the legal sanctions on the entertainment field the war precipitated,17 Dahlberg figuratively conveys this repressive action as the father reasserting his rights over the mother's body. In other words, wartime restrictions on the nature of popular amusement in America are characterized as the prohibition of a primary object of desire. The follow- ing verbal compound establishes the conflation of the historical and the familial in the protagonist's mind: you goddam son of bitchin' bolsheviks, the big parades, the war, the War, THE FATHER, SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST: THE WAR: all ye millions I embrace thee the redlight districts were shut down, puberty sky- scraper erections, tallest building in the world, bigger and better wars, all ye millions I embrace thee, you goddam son of bitchin' bolshe- viks, then what are you doing over here, over there, over there. The yanks are coming . . . the yanks are coming, puberty skyscraper erections, the vaginal walls of jericho are falling. (317-18) If the capitalized liturgical phrase registers strikingly the paternal dynamic operative here, the more surreptitious introduction of this rela- tion in the oath {"son of bitchin'") does so in a more significant manner, associating a political threat to authority (the Russian Revolution) with the child's attempt at usurpation. The father's reassertion of his rights then takes the form of an encircling ("I embrace thee") of the domestic arenas of commercial entertainment from which all interlopers are henceforth excluded ("the redlight districts were shut down"). And it is tempting to read this as a drastically condensed allegory of the historical appropria- tion and transformation of vulgar working-class amusements into forms suitable for more respectable audiences.18 In any event, it follows, given the oedipal resonance of the passage, that these arenas are tantamount to the maternal body. The discovery of the invading offspring ("what are you doing over here") leads to his expulsion, to his being pushed "over there over there," away from the tempting yet forbidden territory of what we might call the national maternal entertainment body. Once he regains control over the sphere of pleasure, once he successfully defends his territory, the father as American military force will be free to return to and satisfy himself upon the domestic body of his wife. In the citation this task is both imminent and accomplished - the verb in the phrase "The yanks are</page><page sequence="10">398 William Solomon coming . . .the yanks are coming" denoting approach yet connoting climax. Lastly, the conjoining of "puberty skyscraper erections" and "vaginal walls . . . falling" may be taken as an evocation of the threat of castration, this threat experienced in relation to the sight of the mother's genitalia. The resolution to this crisis, which Dahlberg does not pursue in "Graphophone," would be for the maturing boy to recognize that he is on the verge of becoming a man. He may anticipate the acquisition of the phallus and the fixing, however precarious, of his sexual identity if he submits to the paternally imposed order and agrees to select a new object of desire. Given the evasive yet firm association between the body of the mother and the realm of commercial entertainment, the correlative burden placed upon the artist would be to find a replacement for the carnival- esque joy his original cultural milieu provided. However, it is quickly revealed in the following section that the 1920s New York nightlife is an inadequate substitute as the character expresses his extreme loathing for the city by figuring it (with some help from the Bible) as a diseased female prostitute. After citing a passage from "the revelation": "babylon the GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH," he begins the concluding section of the piece as follows: "new york, the syphilitic body of god, its jaundiced electric lights diseasing the night, welfare island, a cancerous blurred negative" (318). Where, then, is one to find a satisfying substitute for the pleasures of turn-of-the-century American amusement? Before turning to Flushing, however, it is necessary to step back to the mid-1920s when Dahlberg first began to speculate on the aesthetic signifi- cance of the rise of the metropolis and the incursion of technology into everyday life. His initial engagement with these matters occurs in Mimes, a parodie autobiographical fiction he stopped working on in 1925 (though it would not be published for another half century). A comic (self) portrait of the anachronistic aspirations of a youthful, would-be transcendentalist poet, the narrative is designed as an illustration of a critical thesis. The comic representation of the romantically inclined character's silly efforts to meet the challenge his urban environment presents marks the obsoles- cence of literary pastoralism. If this act of self-mockery allows Dahlberg to overcome his own, old-fashioned artistic tendencies, it also clears the ground for a theoretical articulation of a more up-to-date aesthetic. The critical essay formulates in positive terms the artistic task Mimes outlines negatively: the burden of the artist in the machine age is to renegotiate the relation of the self to his urban, mechanized surroundings, a transaction in which grotesque amusements may play a significant role. For my purposes, the most significant scene in Mimes is its final one. Set in a New York subway station, it depicts the book's protagonist, Leonid Gottinger, undergoing an experience resembling what Fredric Jameson has called the hysterical sublime, diagnosing this as a distinctly post-</page><page sequence="11">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 399 modern predicament.19 Here the suffering Leonid becomes immersed in the urban crowd and consequently loses all sense of personal identity, the terrifying perceptual overload the city generates causing an emotional breakdown. The immediate cause of his psychic despair and subsequent disorientation is a shattered love affair. Yet the interest of the scene ex- ceeds its context in the story in that it links the character's collapse, his inability to organize the events of his life coherently, to an encounter with a threatening mechanized environment. Moreover the crisis involves not only uncertainties about the relation of the human to the technologi- cal but also the difference between male and female. As the body/ machine complex coalesces with a panic pertaining to sexual difference it becomes apparent that for Leonid (and on a more self-conscious level Dahlberg) the threat of the machine is indissociable from the threat of the feminine. Fleeing "madly through the evil city" that appears "to him like a solid cube spinning on its edges," the amusingly agitated character ar- rives at the entrance to a subway. Dahlberg presents the character's descent to the platform as a journey to the underworld, but the experience also resembles the disquieting experience - simultaneously exhilarating and frightening - of taking an amusement park ride.20 However, instead of the thrills and excitement typically associated with the fairground attraction, Dahlberg emphasizes the psychic stress that mechanized sys- tems of transportation tend to produce.21 Standing on the platform as the train arrives, Leonid perceives it to be a gigantic beast. Hurled into the midst of an agglomerated mass of humanity, the character's ability to de- marcate the self from what is outside it vanishes. As the boundaries between his body, other bodies, and his mechanized surroundings erode, the panicked, insecure male loses his sense of agency and identity. All motive power now goes to the machine, Leonid having ceded control over his physical movement through space to the "neolithic colossus." Reaching the platform he saw looming up before him a terrible mon- ster with garish green, amber yellow, and brothel red eyes. As a black ichthyosaurus, it swung about the curb of the grottolike tunnel. The masses, with one collective instinct, fell upon one another and were pushed headlong through the doors by the guards. Losing all per- sonal identity he became completely absorbed into the press of bodies, as a speck of consciousness into Nirvana. The doors being automati- cally slammed to, the huge train, like neolithic colossus, was set in motion. (125) The tiny Leonid is doubly immersed here. Uncomfortably trapped in the surging crowd, he is then engulfed by the monstrous machine.</page><page sequence="12">400 William Solomon Dahlberg genders the "icthyosaurus," its "brothel" eyes vaguely associat- ing the train with female sexuality. Literally propelled into the subway car, Leonid figuratively reenters the body of the mother. From this point of view the plunging of the character into the car evokes a forced reversal of the birth process. His loss of motor control at the door to the electrically powered beast is analogous to a state of fetal or infantile helplessness at the threshold of the maternal womb. As the car gets moving Leonid expe- riences an equally undesirable mingling of his body with the feminized machine. The "horrific cacophony" produced by the grinding of "the pro- digious wheels" of the train along the steel rails of the track engenders "on his brain tone clashes which well ... up into a grandiose discord." "The wheels" seem "to be revolving about within his febrile temples and constantly throbbing against his aching head." "His heart" pounds "up and down within his chest, wildly" pulsating to the "insensate rhythm" that "the terrific hammer blows" of the wheels on the rails smash out. Fatigued by the concussive, shocking assault on his senses, mentally and physically overtaxed by the unwanted, involuntary fusion with the train, Leonid is "lulled . . . into a sort of feverish drowse" (126), over-stimulation of the nervous system leading to a depression of the vital processes. The agonized retreat from the impression of a technological intrusion into the natural body is associated here with a youthful male's anguished sense of being overwhelmed by the maternal. The character's feeling that he is being consumed by the mechanical entity is also experiences as an absorption into a feminized (albeit faintly), undifferentiated mass. When Dahlberg rewrites this scene at the end of From Flushing to Calvary the associations will be enriched such that the anxiety manifested will en- compass not just the subway and the mother but an American form of public amusement too (Coney Island). In other words, his handling of the relation of literature to collective entertainment is consistently coupled with his handling of gender distinctions. But it is essential to keep in mind that in Dahlberg's later fiction this reaction follows and contradicts his concern to come to terms as an artist with urban modernity and tech- nological entertainment media. By the end of the narrative, Leonid's self-knowledge has brought him to the point where he feels he is a "mere automaton" (Dahlberg, 126), his movements and thoughts driven by out- side forces. As the train jerks to a halt, the protagonist, hurled against his seat, falls into a fit of convulsions, his body shaking "spasmodically" as if in the throes of death. Coughing painfully, the vibrations of the subway ring through "his hollow chest like the fatalistic knocking of the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven" (126); he now moves with "absolute mechani- cal resignation" (126). Four years later, in "Ariel in Caliban," Dahlberg articulates explicitly the challenge Mimes communicates implicitly; and in the process begins</page><page sequence="13">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 401 to construct a lineage of artists who have successfully confronted a changed environment. More importantly, he strives in the essay to situate histori- cally the aesthetic and philosophical burdens of the contemporary artist, identifying the ontological and representational or expressive predica- ment of the American writer as particular to modernity. Mechanization remains at the forefront of the discussion while the feminine recedes into the background. Yet we might say that the latter 's place is taken by the freak, the replacement of one by the other justified in the logic of Dahlberg's discourse by virtue of their common existence outside the dominant (masculine) norm and, again from his perspective, their shared affiliation with artifice. Thus his autobiographical protagonists yearn for but remain wary of human oddities, women (mainly in the form of the mother), and technology (mainly in the form of mechanized amusements). First published in This Quarter in 1929, "Ariel in Caliban" is an attempt to formulate an aesthetic that will reconcile the self with its urban-industrial surroundings. Thus Dahlberg calls for the development of a grotesque expressionism that will either project the spiritual (Ariel) outward onto the monstrous urban landscape (Caliban) or at the very least disclose the presence of the other. The grotesque body becomes a kind of crossroads or relay point between the self and its mechanized en- vironment. Consequently, American public attractions such as the dime museum display of human oddities, a Coney Island amusement park exhibit, or forms of commercial entertainment like vaudeville or silent screen comedy, all of which contain grotesque elements, become models for Dahlberg's socially motivated autobiographical aesthetic. Dahlberg begins the essay by identifying the writers, mostly Euro- pean, who have set the stage for the development of what he calls "an aesthetic of diablerie," one that takes as its point of departure the fact that today "life and nature [are] thoroughly mechanized."22 Most impressive is Joyce's achievement. He has "done with ordinary Dublin what no artist has with the subway and surface cars of New York" (5), making the city give perceptual shape to what would otherwise remain invisible: "modern experience." Surprisingly, Dahlberg clarifies the significance of Ulysses, Joyce's "intense personalization of Dublin life," by comparing his literary accomplishment to what amusement park and dime museum attractions have done. Ulysses is "[l]ike Coney Island where the scenic railway, the waxen figures lying in state, the merry-go-round which seems to move in a void and whose jangling music creates the illusion of a vacuum, like Noah's Ark in which the tragedy of machinery is bodied forth by an ingenious materialization of biblical symbols - like Hubert's [sic] Museum whose freaks and hermaphrodites by virtue of their unquestionable reality shadow forth an imaginary world" (6). As he did with Bourne, Dahlberg draws on the imagery of human oddities not</page><page sequence="14">402 William Solomon to reinforce mainstream notions of normality but to contest these. The metaphorical use of the body of the freak as a figure for a general psychic predicament unsettles the reassuring spatial separation and correlative difference in identity the dime museum displays often worked to stabi- lize.23 To the extent that we are spiritually penetrated by our artificial surroundings, we are as internally unnatural as a human oddity appears to be on the outside. Dime museum freaks are representative because in the machine age we are all aberrant or anomalous, at least when mea- sured against obsolete notions of what it means to be a human being. Noting the allusion to the fairgrounds is especially crucial not only be- cause Dahlberg will soon attempt to reproduce the intoxicating appeal of the place in a section of From Flushing to Calvary but also because Coney Island stands "as America's first and probably still most symbolic com- mitment to mechanized leisure/'24 From Dahlberg's point of view, then, the American amusement park was ahead of the American writer in the quest to fashion a critically expressive aesthetic that will be adequate to "the social and economic conditions of a life and nature thoroughly mechanized" (4). The essay also tackles the problem of how one should represent characters under such circumstances, and here it is forms of public amuse- ment that are most valuable. Two recent films from the German UFA cinema, shown at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse provide some useful clues. Anne Boleyn in their production of Henry the Eighth and the maidservant in Backstairs are significant because their gestures "suggest a puppet - but a puppet bent and gnarled by suffering. Here, tragedy, in its true Greek sense has transmuted the face into a mask and the body, its twists and contortions, into a marionette" (4). Since the lamentable truth about con- temporary existence is that the individual lacks agency and is at the mercy of his or her setting, persons are most accurately depicted as spirit- less automatons, things without human volition. An equally worthwhile resource for the writer in search of an appropriate technique is "the American Vaudeville Theatre." The entertainment (as Nathaniel West also realized) is "a rich library" where "a speculative mind interested in the comedy and mechanics of gestures" can find much to observe and learn from, especially by "watching the puppet-like movements of the jiggers" (8). Dahlberg offers one other cultural text to aspiring, machine- age artists: silent screen comedy where one can observe the "inelastic jerks and movements" (4) of Harry Langdon. Henri Bergson's theory of comedy is a precedent, as Dahlberg acknowledges, for the aesthetic emphasis on the inanimate and the involuntary in depictions of persons. In "Laughter" (1900), the argument</page><page sequence="15">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 403 is repeatedly made that "[t]he attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are laughable in exact proportion as that body reminds us of a mere machine."25 What Dahlberg has done then is radicalize this thesis into a philosophy of modern existence (as tragic). Consequently any aes- thetic that proposes to do justice to the conditions of life in the machine age must adapt to the change in circumstances: The metaphysics which arise from machinery and mechanism has more aesthetic value than one which has its roots in naïve phenomena. Philosophy and art, like all physical processes, are ever becoming, and must of necessity move toward a nature with mechanical and industrial encrustations than return to one with a pastoral décor. (8) Yet in "Ariel" Dahlberg articulates and affirms two seemingly contradic- tory processes. On the one hand, he praises under the aegis of "an intense personalization" anthropomorphic embodiments of external reality. We might call this a grotesque prosthesis in that the effect is to complete the collective body by attaching to it the inhuman and inorganic, thus extend- ing the scope and enhancing the power of the human. The animated city becomes a part of the people who live in it, making up for the physical deficiencies of its inhabitants. On the other hand, Dahlberg remarks re- peatedly on the unsettling intrusion of the outside world into the mind and body of subjects, urban, industrialized reality penetrating and dis- abling the human being. As the city and the machine come inside, persons are transformed into things, reified.26 If the end result of moving in one direction is a grotesquely embodied city, the effect of traveling in the other is the grotesque caricature of persons as puppets or marionettes. It remains unclear here whether the artist merely records or helps enact these two processes, but it is evident that the interplay between the two is asymmetrical. The insertion of the external into the internal and consequent emptying out of the substance or spirit of the living is much more prominent in the essay. Caliban tends to obliterate Ariel. This is the condition that an assortment of grotesque American public amusements, mechanized leisure processes, makes perceptible and intelligible. (The waxen figures "lying in state" are imitations of death, the merry-go-round moves "in a void," its jangling music creating "the illusion of a vacuum," and the biblical figures of Noah's Ark materialize, "body forth" "the trag- edy of machinery".) The Coney Island exhibits and rides render and make visible the technified condition of human existence in the machine age, the depersonalized state of nothingness in which we all suffer. So too does the novel Dahlberg would soon set to work on, From Flushing to Calvary.</page><page sequence="16">404 William Solomon Coney Island Abjection Everything is sordid, shoddy, thin as pasteboard. A Coney Island of the mind. The amusement shacks are running full blast . . . Henry Miller, "Into the Night Life/' Black Spring (1936) From Flushing to Calvary is a book that depicts the upsetting of distinctions and permeation of borders. Throughout the novel the barriers between bodies and machines, mothers and sons, persons and landscapes, life and death, the animate and inanimate, inside and outside collapse. Julia Kristeva has approached the effects of these unwelcome yet longed for penetrations by way of the concept of abjection. The abject is what "the deject," the I, desperately excludes, his survival seemingly dependent on the success of his demarcations. Yet the abject refuses to go away; it "be- seeches and pulverizes the subject," contaminating him with what he perceives to be defiling and repugnant and in the process threatening to wreck his sense of identity.27 The assault of the abject is in many respects indistinguishable from the assault of the grotesque. In Flushing Dahlberg attends to the status of the machine, specifically in the form of mecha- nized amusements, in this agonizing process. Striking comic effects from the intercourse of people and things in the context of American enter- tainment, the book employs the grotesque less to erase the boundaries between the human and the natural (or animal) than to unsettle dif- ferences between the human and the technological. The realization the narrative ambiguously pushes towards is an articulation of the represen- tational disruptions caused by an awareness of the mechanical elements of literary autobiography, by an understanding of what writing inevitably does to the living body. Insofar as the subject matter of Flushing is the troubled existence of those at the lower end of the social scale in Depression-era America, the book explores the role that mechanized amusements play in the lives of the disenfranchised, marginalized, and impoverished inhabitants of the country. Focused alternately on Lizzie Lewis and her son Lorry, set predominantly in two New York neighborhoods where, as the epigraph to part one puts it, "cheap peoples live," the novel also attends to the difficulties confronted by two recent immigrants to the country. Jerry Calefonia [sic], newly arrived from the Argentine, is a local bicycle shop repairman who briefly becomes one of Lizzie's numerous suitors; while Willie Huppert, a young German, who hopes to become a famous boxer, is taken in by Lizzie as a boarder. That Dahlberg affiliates himself with and feels compassionate toward his characters is evident throughout, though his sympathetic identifications are always tempered by irony.</page><page sequence="17">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 405 For much of the novel the dependence of lonely individuals on mechanized entertainment is treated as a sad yet funny state of affairs. The pathos arises from the function of the machine as a substitute for physical contact between human beings. In the opening scene, Jerry sits in a Bensonhurst "moviehouse" watching "a very sexy picture/' his head "partially dipped in the silver dust which tipped his ears and hair as it flowed river-wise toward the white sheet."28 Then, after a Harry Langdon comedy, Jerry reaches over and tries to touch the leg of a young girl sitting next to him. Rebuffed, he moves on. Later, however, after pawing a "fourteen-year-old schoolgirl," he is arrested and convicted of child molestation. Willie too initially turns toward the machine for sexual ex- citement. In a penny arcade, having dropped his nickel in the slot, he begins to turn the crank of a "moving picture" machine. "Through stere- opticon lenses he watched her undress. Each clockwork flap of a postcard picture progressively revealed new banks of foaming flesh. Willie brought the crank to a dead halt. He wanted to get his money's worth. Then it went blank with a machine-sprung thud" (180).29 Mocked by a prostitute, who has been watching the autoerotic encounter, Willie accepts her invi- tation to obtain gratification in a more intersubjective manner and winds up with a venereal disease. Whether or not he would have been better off with the moving pictures is left open. Her health failing, her financial situation dire, Lorry's mother is a bit of a medical quack who must also rely on a mechanized apparatus in her daily life. She has two principal sources of income, both of which are designed to end unwanted pregnancies. The second of these involves charging her distressed neighbors for "treatments" with her "violet-ray machine." She also uses the machine on herself to prevent "her bladder from coming down" (18) and as "a nerve tonic" that breaks "up colds, headaches, or rheumatic pains." Feeling "very scientific" whenever she manipulates "the External" or "the Internal" on the device, it functions as "a kind of mediumistic rattlesnake cure for all illnesses" (18-19). Yet halfway through the novel, as the focal point of the narrative shifts toward Lorry's increasingly agitated state of mind, its comic edge begins to fade and the machine and the feminine rise up together as a threat to the male protagonist. Back from California and living with his mother in an apartment in Flushing across the street from Calvary cem- etery, Lorry notices, much to his distress, signs of age and illness on his mother's face and body. To convey further that the boy knows his mother is dying, Dahlberg extends the human /machine relationship to encom- pass the workings of his consciousness, producing an internalized figure of sensory perception as a technological process. "His eyes x-rayed her, passed through her, and somewhere inside of him there was an accurate</page><page sequence="18">406 William Solomon photographic plate of her broken-winged mouth, her dead hair, the dye on it ... her slick shiny embalmed chin. Vaguely, he knew; somehow, he saw her, the photographic negative of her, as if in running water. He didn't want to look too close; for he didn't wish his eyes to tell him anything more" (173).30 The implications of the trope trouble the original invest- ment in the film/literature analogy. If the burden of the initial analogy was to reinforce the illusory presence of the body in the work of art, the trope of seeing as the taking of an x-ray pushes in the opposite direction. Evoking the negative procedures in which the flesh and blood of a human being are visibly eliminated, the latter trope manifests a tension that will erupt again at the end of part three, entitled "Daily Graphic Slabs." Perceiving his mother's eyes as "moving picture epitaphs in her head," Lorry, his fear growing that she is going to pass away, strives to hold on to her physically and emotionally. Presumably, his extreme anxi- ety is partly conditioned by a past trauma; her death would repeat the experience of separation he felt upon being sent to the orphanage as a small child. And if Bottom Dogs repressed this event - the narrative passed over it with a single sentence - its effects are now returning in Flushing. Therefore it is no surprise that, when his mother emerges from her room, groaning and naked save for a white bed sheet she has wrapped around her, he wishes to "go to her, to comfort her." But discovering that the "knack of kissing and petting her was gone," he goes to bed, where he tries "to strain her back to him" in a dream (200-201). Discovering himself in a pawnshop where he is confronted by the body of his apparently de- ceased mother, "a skinny toothpick heap," he desperately strives "to get nearer and nearer to her," petting and fondling her. Realizing that "he couldn't mix his warm breath with hers, for she didn't have any ... for she was a dead oilswamp sea" (201), he weeps until he has "cried himself out." However, as the scene shifts, his pain turns to pleasure, and he be- gins to delight in the separation. Watching a staged performance - perhaps a vaudeville show - in which his mother's teeth are the featured dancers, the dreamer is clearly enjoying himself. "Sitting alone in the audience he watched her front teeth dancing in the pit like a phalanx of robotian men. He clapped his hands to beat the band as he stared at her 14-karat solid- gold tooth tapdancing before the semicircular footlights of her false whiteteeth" (202). It is as if her (imaginary) death has furnished the condi- tions of possibility for the production of a spectacle, one that positions Lorry at a safe, reassuring distance from the engulfing or devouring (the presence of the teeth suggests that the stage is a mouth) event itself. In other words, the dream fulfills the character's wish to be rid of his mother who stands as a constant reminder of his own mortality. But in the final paragraph of the section, Dahlberg indicates that the dilemma is also a representational one and that he, as the author, has yet</page><page sequence="19">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 407 to solve it. Jolted awake, Lorry dresses and rushes out of the house in a panic. "[T]here ran through his brain, in a kind of litany: 'What shall I do? What shall I do?'" (202). He then turns a corner and is confronted by Calvary cemetery with its myriad tombstones, which the narrator oddly refers to as "daily-graphic chewinggum slabs" (202). On the one hand, this sight allows for an enhanced interpretation of the dream imagery. The vision discloses the dancing teeth as symbolic substitutions for the tombstones Lorry passes by daily, "chewinggum" arbitrarily linking the gaping mouth (the pit in which the teeth dance) to the graveyard. On the other hand, this last portion of the scene may also be read as an ex- pression of a specifically authorial anxiety, the "slabs" grasped in turn as reflexive emblems, figures for the autobiographical novel in which they appear. The "slabs" are an undesirable trope from the novelist's point of view because they characterize the text as an inscribed surface metonymi- cally related to its referent, merely in its vicinity. Gravestones of course are placed next to or on top of the corpse they memorialize, neither incar- nating nor preserving this thing against the ravages of time.31 Thus death has been eliminated neither on the psychic nor the aes- thetic level. The threat that the presence of death poses to Dahlberg's representational aesthetic stems from the extent to which this aesthetic rests on the illusory notion that the human body survives in the work of art as a living entity.32 Most intriguing from my standpoint is that Dahlberg's interrogation of this problem consistently occurs in conjunction with forms of commercial entertainment (such as the dance performance above), revealing the centrality of the latter in his thought. And the "ro- botian" men in the dream scene suggest that he is especially fascinated with the mechanical dimensions of contemporary amusements. We can pursue this cluster of issues further in the next part of the book, titled "Coney Island Angelus Bells," which recounts a trip Lorry and friends take to the park on Mardi-Gras night.33 The aesthetic aspiration of the book here is to reproduce verbally the onslaught of sensations a visitor to the park typically receives, to capture the somatic experience of being at Coney Island. The frequent interpola- tions into the narrative of song lyrics and the calls of the park barkers mimic the auditory impressions the place engenders. The anthropomor- phic figurations powerfully convey the effect of visual hyper-stimulation, tropologically induced distortions recreating the hallucinatory impact of an overdose of seeing. The recorded sensations bombard the reader as the narrator's "eye," frenetically mobile, swinging in dizzying arcs as if in imitation of a ride on the merry-go-round or carrousel, makes one feel like part of the "jamming and oceanbillowing" crowd (217), rushing excit- edly from float to ride to exhibit. As Lorry strolls along the boardwalk, the narrator characterizes "the evening" as "still young with dim blue circles</page><page sequence="20">408 William Solomon around its eyes" (212). "[S]ight-seeing in Noah's Ark/' the boys encounter a "stunt automatic giraffe, with a flagpole rigormortis neck" as well as "a macabre skeleton syncopated in lithographic blackness" (218-19). Dahlberg's technique is put to use in an especially energetic manner when Lorry and the girl he has just picked up arrive at the boardwalk dance floor. In this anarchic atmosphere everything is "going at high gear" (227), the jazz band is "going crazy," the "lamps gyrated" (229), the "partners shook against one another like an eruptive civil war" (230). When the music ends and the floor clears, its "varnished pompadour" slides "back off its receding idiot's face. It grinned inanely, masklike at the slippery steppers" (229). After a brief interval, the band starts up again, "the saxophone" taking "on swaddling clothes," going "clean infantile," the "smooth skin of the floor assumed a babyish stare" (229) and, after a tempo change and "a wild blast," the trombone starts "frothing at the mouth" (230). Reading this kinetic part of the novel, it is not surprising that it was Dahlberg who "first pounded into" Charles Olson's head, as he put it in "Projective Verse" (1951), that "one perception must IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION."34 More Crucially, the chiasmic crossing of self and surroundings, the exchange between the animate (human faces and bodies) and the inanimate (saxophone, the dance floor), is embraced here as a means of communicating the nature of the perceptions being recorded. Positioned as a kind of "agentless senso- rium," the reader identifies with a "subject that is all body" in an environment that has been fully embodied.35 Caught up in the physical delirium, Lorry goes off to a side street hotel and has sexual intercourse, probably for the first time, with his date, who turns out to be a prostitute. The act of copulation having been com- pleted, perhaps feeling a bit ashamed, he soon becomes overwhelmed by the grotesque mingling of opposites, the fusion of contraries, that the amusement park experience enforces. This unsettling of difference reaches its peak intensity as he and his friends take an underground boat trip through the park's wax museum, "The Slums of Paris." It is at this point that another reversal in affect occurs, the excitement and attraction of transgression yielding to nausea at the sight of unnatural couplings, scenes of physical excess and ambiguity frightening the observer. Featuring static, immobile and foreboding displays of murderers as well as a cocaine fiend's home, the subterranean ride functions as a counterpart to the reckless mobility and thoughtless abandon the above- ground attractions cultivate. Whereas at the surface level people gather together for noisy, exuberant, and public fun, in the nightmarish realm below one looks at examples of private, domestic immoralities, of the se- cretly illicit behavior that goes on behind closed doors: drug addiction, criminal activity. Resembling a drop into the enclosed world of the mind, the trip (as Dahlberg depicts it) has the effect of an encounter with the</page><page sequence="21">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 409 grotesque other of mainstream society, with the contents of the collective unconscious.36 Notably, Dahlberg compares the process whereby these materials take shape not to the experience of a dream but to the watching of a film, again displacing a psychic phenomenon with a technological one. Traveling "through an artificial canal," in which intervals of darkness give way briefly to lit sets, "projected and extinguished," "disclosed and then dispelled" (234), the sordid exhibits appear and disappear as quickly as the images that flicker across a movie screen. Thus an "underworld boudoir scene" lays "exposed like a cinematographic projection of Plato's concupiscent soul," and while looking at other "dim and luridly lighted" stages Lorry is "forked and pronged [by] the photo-plate darkness" (234). Lorry nears emotional breakdown, however, as the boat passes by a set of "freaks." The ambiguous mingling of the human and the animal and different sexes as well as the sight of the overflowing flesh of "exotic" persons threaten to collapse the classificatory oppositions that govern definitions of the subject and existence in general, precipitating a kind of nervous breakdown: There was Irene, the jolly fat girl, her bushman clack-clack laughter tripping up and down the gargantuan staircases of her throat; Hubert's museum trained mobocratic fleas; trained businessmen; Alzora, the turtle girl, a swiftian fleshblob; Elsie-John, The Enigma of the Human Race, the hermaphrodite, a freakish spinozistic proof of a dualistic universe, the mysterybox . . . (235) These sights are followed by "Woo Foo, the immune man," "the leprous leopard boy," marvels such as the "World Wonder," which, if looked at through a microscope, has the lord's prayer engraved on the head of a pin, and "the maharajah mentalist" possessed of a "radio mind" (236).37 Feeling physically ill, Lorry also falls into a vertiginous mental spin. Able neither to comprehend the oddities he has seen nor to distinguish be- tween the natural and the unnatural, the character becomes panic stricken in his confrontation with what Miller would term a few years later in "Into the Night Life" the "[s]overeign pasteboard power" of the amusement park. "The faked-up grotto made of wood and canvas recalled Calvary cemetery, all those boulders which formed a wall around the graveyard and which were so intensely natural as to suggest artifice. All the desola- tion and dizziness of artifice, of contrived unreality swirling in his brain and in the pit of his stomach" (236). Presented by a series of perceptual and cognitive paradoxes, tortured by the fluidity of demarcations, the boy's thoughts turn back to his mother, in his mind a "dissociated skull," the return precipitating another set of suspended differences, the living son penetrated by the image of the inanimate mother. "Death lay in his stomach . . . and he wanted to get it out. He wanted to be clear of her, to cut the material film- vision of her out of his brain" (237). Running in</page><page sequence="22">410 William Solomon desperation to the subway, "the carousel screaming . . . and fleshblobbing in his ears/' thoughts of his "mother's oatmealy, scribbled, and shriveled up throat" plaguing him, the boy suddenly vomits on the station stairs, "gardenseedcereal . . . pouring out of his mouth. . . . He didn't want to go back" (238). The contents of the vomit include, I am arguing, the artificial, the feminine (maternal), the mechanical as well as death. Experienced as an assault from outside on his body and ego, these seemingly foreign ele- ments must be jettisoned, expelled in order to preserve the collapsing integrity of the frightened male subject. It is tempting to interpret Lorry's panic attack from the point of view Stallybrass and White set forth in their chapter on bourgeois female hysteria in The Poetics and Politics of Transgression. The class to which she belongs having historically labored to detach itself from the low and grotesque, the middle class woman finds herself confronted by a set of fantasy creatures, imaginary Others in which distinctions of all sorts are cancelled (1 71-90). 38 Yet since Lorry's (and Dahlberg's) social origins are "low," it is more accurate to say that this process of separation is just get- ting underway here. We are witnessing in a sense the start of an authorial attempt to construct himself as a subject in opposition to the freakishly grotesque, which threatens to dissolve the boundaries between self and other. Moreover, if following Kristeva we define abjection as a force that has the capacity to cause meaning to collapse and put the "I" at risk, then it becomes equally feasible to argue that Dahlberg represents here a con- frontation with such an overwhelming "horror." Notably in Flushing the abject - appearing as a mixture of the technological, the sexual, and the aesthetic - is shown to be capable of pulling the fragile subject back to his origins in a compost heap of inorganic and organic materials. In any event, for Lorry to solidify his integrity and identity, he must subdue this threat, thrust aside or expel what he takes to be unbearably filthy and confusing. In the novel's next part Dahlberg interpolates the following memory into the narrative in order to display the character's strong reaction to such encroachment as a defense against incestuous longings. when he [Lorry] was 9 he didn't want to sleep with his mother: in winter he didn't mind as much . . . but July and august were sticky months: days when he smelled his own nose and his own lips: all the swearword parts of the body fretted him like big hossflies and when he could not shoo them away he cried and goddamned and believed that the devil who he had seen in the cowboy and indian gillis theatre at a matinee performance had gotten a bearhug on him and was holding him as fast as the staves of a barrel and was trying to put him up to things he didn't want to do.</page><page sequence="23">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 411 Then he wanted icicle January back . . . then his thoughts could be as straight as trees and as white as clouds and soapsuds and his muscles as hard as the rocks of the baptist church . . . He wanted a room and a bed for himself . . . (242) Here too an intolerable proximity to the mother and to mechanical forms of entertainment coalesces. The imagery of the second paragraph sug- gests that if the child is frightened, it is because castration will be the punishment for his physical proximity to his mother. That Lorry in a later recollection admits to having wished his father figure dead confirms the oedipal interpretation. Kristeva also mentions food-loathing as a typical "seme" of abjection, alongside fear of death and incest (92-97). Earlier, during his visit to Coney Island, Lorry has remembered his youthful dietary predicaments as well: "he never could eat red lobster meat in the electric oysterhouse because of its smell. Now it all came back and stirred in him: seaside oysterhouse brine curled in his nostrils" (220). Struggling against the drive to mingle the self with feminized entertainment ma- chines, the desperate, nauseated character must sever his ties with two associated sources of defilement, must break free of a mother he finds repulsive and equally loathsome mechanized amusements. Previously drawn to both, Lorry now realizes that his subjectivity depends on his ability to keep both technology and his dying mother at bay. I have been arguing that the predicament exhibited here is simulta- neously a psychological and a representational one: the author's ambiva- lence toward his mechanized aesthetic of personal expression has been superimposed upon the character's uncertainties in regard to the maternal body. In Flushing an autobiographical theme and a reflexive concern with an artistic problem are densely intertwined. The text therefore helps dis- close the extent to which in the 1930s the perceived excesses of femininity and technology combined to form a complex dilemma for the male writer. In that these two forces constituted both an opportunity and a danger, establishing a close relationship with them was a paradoxically invigorat- ing and disabling strategy for the dissident prose writer. Operating at a time when the ideology of modernism had started to crumble, which de- stabilized the notion that art was a masculine preserve, Depression-era radical authors found their identity to be in flux. Dahlberg's ultimate re- sponse, which I have only hinted at in this piece and will not trace in detail, was to swerve backward. By the end of the decade he had adopted and begun to defend fiercely and rigidly an anachronistic romantic pasto- ralism - a claim that a reading of Do These Bones Live would easily confirm. The period as a whole, however, offers the critical scholar the chance to examine certain variants of the cultural enterprise Dahlberg helped fos- ter and then abruptly abandoned. As I mentioned above, Henry Miller's</page><page sequence="24">412 William Solomon Depression-era autobiographical prose, in particular the sections of Black Spring (1936) set in the U.S. and Tropic of Capricorn (1939), is indispensable in this respect. For in his writing, too, the realm of American public amuse- ment, from dime museum displays through American burlesque and early film to vaudeville, was powerfully affirmed as a vital resource for the radicalized artist. For instance, at the end of "The Fourteenth Ward/' the autobiographical installment with which Black Spring begins, the nar- rator recalls one of the dazzling experiences of his youth, his entering "The Dragon's Gorge," a ride at Coney Island's Luna Park, as an initiation to the dream world of the aesthetic. In addition, Miller, surprisingly given his notorious reputation as the misogynist writer par excellence, relies quite heavily, though often in a hidden manner, on feminized forms of commercial entertainment in fashioning his autobiographical practice. This is not to defend him necessarily, but simply to suggest that at a level deeper than representational portraiture or obvious theme one may un- cover gender ambiguities deserving of critical attention. Miller's remarkably provocative undertaking may thus be consid- ered an extension of the project Dahlberg was one of the first American writers to articulate theoretically and pursue practically. Both sought to craft an autobiographical aesthetic adjusted to urban-industrial moder- nity, to construct a machine-age grotesque literature, and both found past American amusements to be crucial sources of inspiration for such an undertaking. The result in Miller was the development of a Utopian ap- proach that might be called a techno-carnivalesque, a rhetorical strategy designed to generate comic monstrosities, to use humor to produce hy- brid creatures in which the mechanical and the human, the technological and the natural happily converge. That this took place as a radically moti- vated enterprise, albeit of a politically unorthodox or anarchic sort, makes this topic an even more promising area of further inquiry. My point has been that Dahlberg's neglected critical and autobiographical prose puts us in a position to take this next step, bringing us to the threshold of a cluster of issues on which our sense of our own postmodernity hinges.39 Notably, there is no evidence that Miller, who published after Dahlberg, had read or even was aware of the novels of the latter. This lack of direct connection is especially suggestive in respect to the period under dis- cussion, a time when the ideological structures of modernism were beginning to break down. It is as if the clues to understanding who or what cultural practice is encouraging us to become today lie buried in the cracks of an era still dominated by the monuments of modernism.

In the revised edition of his literary history, Dahlberg altered the title to Can These Bones Live. 2. See the collections Edward Dahlberg: American Ishmael of Letters, ed. Harold Billings (Austin, Texas: Roger Beacham, 1968), and Edward Dahlberg: A Tribute, ed. Jonathan Williams (New York: David Lewis, 1970). 3. In the two most comprehensive, recent accounts of the Depression-era novel and 30s left-wing culture in general, Barbara Foley's Radical Representations (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1993), and Michael Denning's The Cultural Front (New York: Verso, 1996), Dahlberg is mentioned only in passing. 4. 1 prefer this term over the more commonly used "mass culture" and "popu- lar or traditional culture" to avoid the familiar debates that the use of the latter two inevitably engenders. Moreover, it is my conviction that the phenomena in question (the assorted forms of commercial entertainment extant in the U.S. be- tween roughly 1880 and 1930) blurs the distinction between mass and traditional culture. This is to say that institutions and practices like the dime museum, slapstick film, amusement park displays of human oddities [freak shows] and mechanized rides, and vaudeville constitute a mixture of culture made by people for themselves and administered culture. In other words, the period on which the Depression-era radical novelist looked back was a transitional one in which the power of the culture industry could be felt but was by no means absolute. 5. All these quotes are drawn from "Comedy's Greatest Era," James Agee's 1949 retrospective account of the significance of silent slapstick film, the glory years of which he dates as being between 1912 and 1930. His particular reference point in the citations is Mack Sennett. See Agee on Film: Reviews and Comments (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 6-7. 6. My phrasing here is derived from Marilyn Hansen's "The Mass Production of the Senses: Classical Cinema as Vernacular Modernism." Hansen is concerned here to go beyond the distinctions governing the priorities of "high" or "hege- monic" modernism, to participate in the critical project (already, as she notes, well under way) of rediscovering the heterogeneity, at the level of practice and theory, of modernist aesthetics. See Modernism /Modernity 6:2 (1999): 59-77, espe- cially 59-60. Peter Berger 's concept of the historical avant-garde (dada and surrealism) as artistic movements between the two world wars that tended not to fit into now increasingly obsolete notions of the modernist phenomenon is, to my mind, a crucial touchstone for all such returns to the period in question. See Berger, The Theory of the Avant-Garde, trans. Michael Shaw (Minneapolis: Univer- sity of Minnesota Press, 1984). See also Andreas Huyssen's well-known piece "Mass Culture as Woman: Modernism's Other," where he critically examines the use of gender as a means of "fortifying the boundaries between genuine art and inauthentic mass culture," After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, and Post- modernism (London: Macmillan), 53. The specificity of Dahlberg's undertaking (which resembles that of the historical avant-garde) is that he openly drew aes- thetic inspiration from a set of material practices, which I refer to as carnivalized</page><page sequence="26">414 William Solomon American amusements, that he no doubt gained access to as a member of a relatively marginal, subcultural community. On categorizing his approach as an- ticipating postmodern rhetorical strategies, see note 39 below. 7. Huyssen, "The Machine and the Vamp," 1986, 71. 8. As Dahlberg notes "the gap between touch and thing" is a citation from W. C. Williams's "Jacataqua" in In the American Grain (1925). 9. Alexander Graham Bell invented the graphophone in the 1880s, naming it by reversing the syllables of Edison's machine. Both the phonograph and grapho- phone were intended to serve as business instruments, as dictating or "talking machines/' By the 1890s, its designers had realized, however, that the apparatus was much more profitable when marketed as an entertainment device, as a "sing- ing machine." See David Nasaw, "Talking and Singing Machines, Parlors, and Peep Shows," in The Rise and Fall of Public Amusements (New York: Harper Collins, 1993), 120-21. Friedrich A. Kittler points out that the graphophone was also a Columbia brand name. He also cites a 1902 assessment of the promise of the technological apparatus; in a manual on the Care and Usage of Modern Speaking Machines, Alfred Parzer-Muhlbacher claims that the graphophone will create memory "archives and collections": "Cherished loved ones, dear friends . . . who have long since passed away will years later talk to us again with the same vivid- ness and warmth; the wax cylinders transport us back in time to the days of youth." Lastly, Kittler locates the origin of the nonliterary components of this analogy in the psychophysical work of Jean Marie Guyau's. In his "Memory and Phonograph" (1880) Guy au embraces "the phonograph as the only suitable model for visualizing brain or memory." See Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, trans.

Graphophone, Film, Typewriter, 16. 14. 1 ignore here the political and social ambiguities of the minstrel show as a cultural phenomenon because from the point of the view adopted in "Grapho- phone," the performance appears as a wholly positive event.

Actually the phrase is the "syphilitic body of god," which follows from the use of a passage from the Book of Revelations as an epigraph to this final section of the prose poem. The biblical allusion (to Babylon as the mother of harlots and other abominations) establishes New York City as the locus of sexual and sinful temptation for men. See John Dos Passos's Manhattan Transfer (1925) for a similar framing of the city. It is difficult to determine whether Dahlberg is affirming this</page><page sequence="27">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 415 attitude toward the city, thus instancing his disgust with the intertwining of capi- talist economics and culture in postwar urban entertainment, or whether he is ventriloquizing the moralizing reformism that arose around this time, one result of this trend prohibition.

Mark Seltzer would no doubt correlate the rival tendencies Dahlberg en- deavors to manage here with the conflict between a residual market and dominant machine culture which corresponds as well to the tension between possessive individualism and the disciplinary production of subjects. If market culture per- sonifies, machine culture reifies and it is the interaction of these two competing psychological, social, and economic impulses that makes up the double logic of realist and naturalist discourses.

Willie is operating a mutoscope. Invented in 1897, the mutoscope improved upon the kinetoscope by enabling the viewer to control the performance by turn- ing the crank by hand.

Nasaw notes that for awhile the x-ray machine was "all the rage" at amusement parlors until Edison's assistants learned that exposure to its radiation ulcerated human flesh, caused hair loss, and could kill people (1993: 127).</page><page sequence="28">416 William Solomon- Si .

In "Donne: 'But Yet the Body is His Booke'," Elaine Scarry puts it this way: his [Donne's] "poetry successfully incorporates the material realm and, in par- ticular, the human body." My argument is that Dahlberg self-consciously reflects upon his failure to incorporate the human body into his work. See Literature and the Body: Essays on Populations and Persons, ed. Elaine Scarry (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1988), 70-105. 33. In Amusing the Millions: Coney Island at the Turn of the Century, John Kasson notes, in the context of a discussion of Joseph Stella's "Battle of Lights, Mardi Gras, Coney Island," that Mardi Gras night was a post-Labor Day celebration. The painting, from 1913, thus treats the same "carnal frenzy" (Stella, quoted in Kasson: 90) that Dahlberg would attempt to capture in literary form two decades later (New York: Hill and Wang, 1978), 88. 34.

In Flushing the carnivalesque can therefore be said to manifest itself both as a participatory activity and as an objectified spectacle. If in some areas of Coney Island the distance between people collapses, on the dance floor for instance, elsewhere the park works to reinforce culturally determined norms, placing the "exotic," "bizarre," "aberrant" other on stage so as to strengthen the visitor's sense of his or her own normalcy. Notably, however, the delirious mingling of the carnivalesque as collective action carries over to the carnivalesque as spectacle in the novel, thus undoing the reassuring, distancing effect of the exhibit, the ob- server overwhelmed by the observed. See Stewart, On Longing, 107-11. 38. See also, Mary Russo: "the grotesque goes underground in the course of the nineteenth century, becoming increasingly hidden and dispersed - a private and 'nocturnal' category, to be retrieved by Freud as socially disembodied in the theory of the unconscious."

For him, such a change in attitude has the benefit of drawing our attention to perhaps "the fundamental feature of all the postmodernisms . . . namely the effacement in them of the older (essentially high-modernist) frontier between high culture and so-called mass or commercial culture, and the emergence of new kinds of texts infused with the forms, catego- ries, and contents of that very culture industry so passionately denounced by all</page><page sequence="29">Disinterring Edward Dahlberg 417 the ideologues of the modern, from Leavis and the American New Criticism all the way to Adorno and the Frankfurt School/' See Postmodernism (1991), 2.
