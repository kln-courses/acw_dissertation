<plain_text><page sequence="1">WITIKO ACCOUNTS FROM THE JAMES BAY CREE Regina Flannery, Mary Elizabeth Chambers, Patricia A. Jehle ABSTRACT Three categories of oral narratives concerning the Eastern Subarctic Algonquian Witiko comprex are presented. Category A9 Atalokan^ Tales of Primeval Times, and category B, Tebatchimowin , Long Ago Stories, are categories of folklore. The third category, C, comprises historic witiko incidents. Emphasis is given to the distinction between Witiko, a folklore being, and witikos, who are humans possessed by cannibalistic cravings. The Cree differentiate both from other fearsome beings. The narratives were all collected in the 1930s so that those of the historical category, C, record events of the late nineteenth century. The collection reflects the exis- tence of a cohesive Witiko belief system prior to the turn of the century. INTRODUCTION The narratives presented in this article were gathered between 1932-1938 by John M. Cooper and Regina Flannery while they conduct- ed general ethnographic field research among the Eastern Cree in the James Bay region.1 These are stories which concern the cannibal Wi^tiko; they were volunteered by elderly and middle-aged Cree informants from Moose Fac- tory, Albany and Attawapiskat on the West Coast and Fort George, Eastmain, and Rupert fs House on the East Coast of James Bay. It be- came apparent during the course of the field- work that a strong oral narrative tradition persisted among the elderly Cree, and on re- turn visits Flannery collected more detailed accounts of stories recorded earlier. The informants usually were careful to dis- tinguish "true stories" of their own experi- ence or those of relatives from a:ta:lo:kan and teba:tcimó:win.2 Atalokan are tales of a primeval time when animals spoke and behaved like men, while tebatcimowin are stories of "long ago" in which the exact locale or per- sons involved are unclear. In several in- stances our informants did not specify cate- gory so it is difficult to determine whether the narrative refers to the distant or the relatively recent past. Some stories were difficult for the authors to categorize; these contain folkloric motifs , such as the human witiko !s heart of ice that would not be con- sumed in the fire, within accounts that other- wise would appear to record historical events. This paper includes, in addition to the two folklore narrative types, dated historical events involving human witikos , but we note that the events recorded in the atalokan and tebatcimowin are believed by the Eastern Cree to be as authentic as those in the narratives which we label historical. The Cree informants who related these stories made a clear distinction between Witiko, a supernatural cannibal being with anthropomorphic characteristics, and witiko, a human who develops cannibalistic cravings. The descriptions of Witiko given to us agree with those given to Smith (1976:25-26) by the Western Woods Cree. Witiko is said to be ter- rifying in appearance, although there is no concensus on details. Other characteristics of a Witiko are a heart of ice, enormous strength, and the power to paralyze humans. More importantly, Witiko has the power to transform mortals into cannibals. The Witiko fs power, however, can only be overcome L Cooper was at Rupert fs House and Fort George in 1932, at Moose Factory in 1933, and at Rupert's House and Moose Factory in 193^. Flannery was at Moose Factory in 1933; at Moose Factory, Albany, and Attawapiskat in 1935; at Rupert's House, Eastmain, and Fort George in 1937; and at Rupert's House in 1938. Fieldwork was conducted from mid-June to mid- September. zAn interpreter was used for all the narra- tives except those related by Jane Morrison and John Costeon. Cree terms were transcribed by Cooper and Flannery in the field phoneti- cally in the dialect of the informant. Terms for the Cree categories of narratives {atalokan and tebatcimowin) are in the "L!: dialect as spoken at Moose Factory. Vowel length is indicated the first time a Cree word is used but is omitted thereafter. 57 Arctic Anthropology XVIII-1, 1981</page><page sequence="2">58 Arctic Anthropology XVIII-1 and his destruction accomplished through the use of conjuring. An interesting difference in detail between the descriptions of Witiko given by Smith» s informants to the north and the Cree of James Bay concerns Witiko !s stature. In the south he is a "giant" who uses treetops as snowshoes and covers vast distances with every step. The Western Woods Cree maintained he was of average size, explaining that in the forest and barre nlands to the north many creatures , such as the barren ground caribou, are smaller in size than in the more southern forest (Smith 1976:25-26). Human witikos also have definable charac- teristics according to our informants. They develop hearts of ice, aré unkempt and dirty in appearance, are white around the mouth, and frequently "have bad looks on them." Human witikos find children to be especially appetiz- ing food, and sometimes they see humans as having been metamorphosed into beaver or other animal forms . In recent articles Preston (1975:239-2^0; 1978:65-67) has questioned the existence of a cohesive Witiko belief system among the north- ern Algonquians. He argues the Witiko concept is diffuse, merging the Witiko being with other fearsome creatures, including white trap- pers or other strangers or monsters. He sug- gests that: From one recorded version to another, some narratives replace Witigo with other crea- tures , without altering many other aspects . Witigo is, when looked at in this synthetic fashion, more a matter of attitude than he is a definable person. (Preston 1978:65-66) Since our collection, recorded in the 1930s, indicates a cohesive Witiko belief system, it may be that Preston fs more recently collected materials reflect a changing oral narrative tradition among the Eastern Cree. That is, his interpretation may hold for the contemporary body of folklore due to a gradual synthesis of once distinct folklore beings by his informants. Teicher fs collection of folklore stories re- corded by a number of researchers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also portrays the Witiko being as distinct from other folklore beings (Teicher 1960:2) and thus lends support to our position. As noted previously, our Cree narrators clearly distin- guished between Witiko and humans who became possessed by cannibalistic cravings, that is, witikos. They further made a distinction be- tween these and "white men" (wa:baniHyu or o:ct:po:)9 pwa:tak (Sioux Indians), and other fearsome beings such as rrrtstatim (big dog, often translated as lion or other wild animal). With the exception of a single narrative which suggests the blending of Witiko with "white men" (C:II:3), in none of our folklore stories are other creatures or supernatural beings ac- corded the powers of Witiko, nor are they described as having similar characteristics. The Witiko literature contains few Eastern Cree texts; of the 31 folktales compiled by Teicher (i960), for example, only six are Cree. In this article we present an additional 15 Eastern Cree Witiko folktales. Of Teicher !s nine historical Cree Windigo cases five are Western or Plains Cree. To the four Eastern Cree cases should be added, however, the inci- dent from Eastmain River on James Bay, which Teicher (l96O:8O) lists among the Montagnais- Naskapi cases, since it falls within the area presently recognized as Cree rather than Montagnais. To our knowledge the only addi- tional materials published since Teicher which detail historical incidents involving human witikos are: Bishop (1975:2^3) who gives from the eighteenth century archives two incidents from Fort Severn on HudsonTs Bay and one from Albany on James Bay; Smith (1976:22), one case in I7U1 at Churchill, Manitoba; and Preston (1975:116-129), one case which occurred about I88O, narrated to him by Eastmain Cree. These, plus our 12 historical cases from James Bay, increase the total of Cree cases to 27, of which 19 are Eastern Cree. Both the folklore and historical cases in Teicher are predominantly Ojibwa-Saulteaux. As a consequence, analyses based on this body of material have tended to obscure what we feel may be differences between the Ojibwa and Eastern Cree Witiko belief systems. Teicher does not separate atalokan from tebatcimowin , a native distinction almost invariably made by our informants. We find some James Bay stories include a number of motifs which occur with some regularity in the Ojibwa-Salteaux tests, for example, Witiko fattens up victims before killing them or conjuring to destroy the fear- some being, but our historical episodes reflect a much greater latitude among the Cree in deal- ing with suspected, incipient, or proven witikos . Of the 12 individuals who were the subjects of our "true" witiko accounts , eight were known to have actually been cannibals and four were feared to be on the verge of killing in order to survive. In three cases of starvation cannibalism the victims were not killed, but had died of natural causes and the act was ap- parently a one-time event with no subsequent craving for human flesh. In several cases "cures" were effected through magical means and conjuring. In one case a starving man who had killed his wife and children was cured when forced to drink warm grease, although this story contains elements which suggest it is a tebatcimowin. In only one case was it reported that a young person developed the craving first and then became a cannibal. In none of the</page><page sequence="3">Flannerys Chambers and JeKle: Cree Witiko Accounts 59 cases did an individual request to be killed. Although our informants stated that in the past a cannibal was killed to prevent further murders , only one actual case of killing a witiko woman and her daughter was given to us by Cree narrators. In other cases the persons were either ostracized or they were tolerated, but watched, in the community. Personnel of the Hudson's Bay Company reported four instances in which persons showing serious symptoms of witiko cravings has been killed in the nine- teenth century at Eastmain and Rupert's House. One of the men who killed a relative under these circumstances was still living in the 1930s. This and the fear of legal retribution may account for the reticence of the Cree in that area to discuss witiko killings. Informants exhibited a level of matter-of- factness or frankness about witikos, starva- tion, and cannibalism that mirrors the reali- ties of life in the bush. The winter component of the seasonal round produces stressful situa- tions which are dealt with on both practical and symbolic levels. The hazards of bush life in the winter require feexlibility on the part of the subsistence unit and the consequences of errors in judgement can be severe. Group organization during this time requires the fragmentation of larger aggregates into small, familial groups existing in isolated settings. In our accounts the victims and cannibals are most frequently family members , and cannibalis- tic acts are often individual acts, performed in isolated locations. For the Cree the Witiko complex functions as both a symbolic expres- sion of the dangers and isolation inherent in a subarctic existence and as a means of rationalizing fear and explaining deviant be- havior. Identification of witikos is based on a wide variety of behaviors that are judged to be abnormal, and the means for handling threatening individuals are likewise flexible and situational. East Coast Indians, however, did not readily volunteer details of cannibalistic behavior, while our other informants were explicit in identifying both kin and non-kin as cannibals or victims. Informants did not blame witikos for the unexplained disappearance of hunters or others , but most often attributed their disappearance to starvation or accidents while on the hunt. The lone adult survivor of a group that had starved was usually viewed with suspicion, but evidence was sought to deter- mine whether or not cannibalism had taken place. Many instances of starvation cannibalism were recognized as one-time events with no subse- quent effects on the individual's behavior. Finally, none of the narratives given to us in- cludes an element of group contagion (cf. Teicher 1960:113). The stories that follow have been grouped for convenience of reference into: AI, atalokan: Tales of Primeval Times about Witiko; All, atalokan: Tales of Primeval Times about witikos; BI, tebatcimowin , Long Ago Stories about Witiko; BII, tebatcimowin , Long Ago Stories about witikos; CI, Historical witiko incidents; CII, Historical incidents involv- ing "White Men". A. ATALOKAN: TALES OF PRIMEVAL TIMES Group AIj Witikos A common motif unifies the following atalokan; Witikos are blinded and confused through the use of excreta. In these stories the Witiko is thoroughly thwarted by the use of excreta and other ploys which suggest con- juring. "Why There Are So Many Witikos" (AI:l) is a Witiko origin myth referring to the time when a Witiko lived with human families . The Witiko was mortally wounded and cannibalized by the people, who themselves became Witikos. Witikos then spread throughout the world, thus accounting for their presence everywhere to- day. Willy McLeod had also heard this tale from an Abitibi woman, indicating the story was not confined to Albany. The two versions of "When The Cannibals Lived Together" (AI:2,3) contain several ele- ments common to the first atalokan; however, they describe the time when all the Witikos lived in one community. In the second version (AI: 3) Wis'ekwedjak, the culture hero, is iden- tified as the protagonist. Teicher has pre- sented an Ojibwa Windigo story dealing with Nanabushu ( 1960:25-26) and a Cree Whitiko story of Wesakaychak (1960:3*0- These' stories of the culture hero have no similarities to our atakokan mentioning Wisekwedjak. It is unlikely the Wisekwedjak cycle contains two events involving Witiko; therefore, we believe our informant misidentified the Indian in our atalokan as Wisekwedjak. The final atalokan, "A Girl In A Menses Hut Escapes Witiko," (AI:H) is included in this set because of the excreta motif. We note that in this tale Witiko cannibalizes himself, a theme discussed in Teicher (i960: 20). AI: 2 Why There Are So Many Witikos Albany Harvey Smallboy JMC:1933 In olden times two or three families al- ways lived together. Once there were a few families living along a lake. There was a Witiko looking for human victims and he was heading to where the families were camped. The Witiko found one Indian. The Indian knew</page><page sequence="4">60 Arctic Anthropology XVIII-1 he was going to meet a Witiko. He saw the Witiko in the bush and ran off so the Witiko could not come near. The Witiko kept follow- ing the Indian, but at last the Witiko was a long piece off and out of sight. The Indian gathered a lot of brush, put it in a pile and tied it round and round. The brush was the size of a human being and the man placed it right in his own trail. The Witiko thought the Indian was a moose and when the Witiko came to the tied- up brush he thought," I have caught the Indian at last and he is dead." So the Witiko put his carrying strap around the brush and carried it home. Later the Witiko came to the tents where the families were staying. The people said, He is carrying a bundle of brush." The Witiko said, "Brush? This is not brush. This is the moose I was after." They went to work, opened up the bundle, and found it was only brush. So the Witiko knew that he had not killed the Indian after all. So the Witiko went off again following the same Indian's trail. He came upon the Indian again and followed him. In those days men wore no pants , only breechclout and leggings , therefore the buttocks were bare. When the Witiko was chasing the man, the man fell head- long in the snow and lay there a long time resting. The Witiko came up to him and saw the man's buttocks sticking up and started to feel them, saying, "This is a strange looking stump. The Indian must have been rubbing on this. It is quite warm." So the Witiko passed this and went straight ahead. After a while the Indian got up and went after the Witiko 's tracks. Soon the Witiko knew that the man was on his trail, so he turned about and got behind him. The Witiko kept chasing the man until it got dark. The Indian left the Witiko far behind. He climbed a tree. When it was getting dark the Witiko camped right under the tree. The Witiko made a fire and lay down on his back with his face up. Later, the man had to make water and it ran right down in the Witiko 's eyes. As his face became wet he said, "I will not get my moose now." Then the Indian had to defecate and excrement fell right on the Witiko 's face and he said, "How is it that the clouds are pissing such stuff now?" As he started to clear his eyes, he smelled the ex- crement and said, "I am sure this is moose dung. It seems there is a moose in the sky, too." He decided he would stay there until morning. In the morning the Witiko saw the Indian sitting in the tree, so he fired his bow and arrow at him. The man cried, "Do not fire at your moose. You will lose his blood. Try and climb up to me." So the Witiko threw down his bow and arrow and climbed the tree. When the Witiko was coming close, the Indian started pulling bark off the tree and dropping it on his face to blind him. The man said, "Hold down your head or you will get something in your eyes." The Witiko obeyed and shut his eyes. The Indian had a bone spear with him and he stuck it in the back of the Witiko* s neck as the Witiko lowered his head and closed his eyes . The Witiko fell down as though he were dead, but then stood up and headed home. As he went the man followed slowly to watch him un- til he reached home. The families in the tent at the Witiko fs camp heard him coming; they noticed the Witiko was not talking, only moaning like one who was very sore. The people tried hard to pull the spear from the Witiko 's neck, but they could not do it. So one of them said, "Get the old- est one. He will have sense. He will know how to do it." The old man came along, but he could not remove the spear and said, "Run for a wiser one still. He will know how to do it." So the one sent for came and asked, "Why are you so foolish? Heat the spear with fire and drive it right through." They heated the bone point and drove it through and it came out right through his throat. The Witiko made a choking nose and he died. All of the people in the tent started to weep for the Witiko. One of them said, "Go away for someone with good sense so the Witiko will be buried in a decent way." So the wise person sent for came and started to make a plan for the burial of the Witiko. He in- structed them saying, "The Witiko !s wife will cook and we will all eat him. After we have finished eating we will all cry and walk away crying, each in different directions." This was done. After they finished eating everyone started to cry and walk off from the tent in different directions. All these Witikos kept going. This was the last of them. They all turned into Witikos and that is why there are so many Witikos all around the world now. AI:U When All the Cannibals Lived Together Version One Albany Patrick Stevens RF:1935 They say the cannibals have a place where they all live together. One of the cannibals went off to hunt and saw signs of a person so he followed the tracks. At last the man found out the cannibal was after him and he ran off. The cannibal (continued to) follow the track and after awhile the man got tired and climbed up a tree. The cannibal did not see the track anywhere and stopped below the tree. So the man let his excrement down on him. It fell in the cannibal's face. He thought it was the</page><page sequence="5">FlanneryA Chambers and Jéhle: Cvee Witiko Accounts 61 clouds falling on him so he went away. The man came down and started to run again. The cannibal went right after him and fol- lowed his tracks . The man heard the cannibal behind him and again he got tired of running. So he pulled down his pants and just stood there cracking his bottom. Soon the cannibal came down the trail and felt the man. He thought it was a root pulled bare and he said, "My grandfather must have been working here lately." So the cannibal went on and left the man there. The man started running again on the same trail. When the man got tired he climbed up a tree. He took a forked stick and threw it at the can- nibal. The stick fell right on the back of the cannibal's neck. The cannibal could not pull it out so he had to continue on like that . The cannibal asked the rest of the cannibals to try and pull the stick out of his neck. He was calling out when they tried to do so. Then he said, "Go for another one who knows more about this." So they got the one who was supposed to know more. When he came he or- dered the others to drive the stick further in the cannibal. They killed that cannibal. The (wise) cannibal told them to cook the dead one. So they cooked him and ate him. After- wards they all went off in different direc- tions. The cannibals said, "The first two who meet will have a fight and the one who is beaten is the one we will eat next time." They could never have met because nothing more is known about them when they were going around together. AI: 3 When All the Cannibals Lived Together, Version Two Albany Frank Rickard JMC:1933 "Devils" (Witikos) were walking about, and at last they saw tracks of people. They started to go after the people, following their tracks. One Indian (Wisekwedjak) knew the Witikos were after him and ran off. He kept running in a circle when the Witikos were after him. At last the Indian got tired. He had to loosen his pants and finally was so tired he fell in the snow. His bare behind was sticking up where he was expecting the Witikos to come from. Witiko mistook the be- hind for a stump, found it warm, and said "The Indian has just been passing here so that stump hefs been rubbing on is still warm." When Witiko felt that warmth he ran saying, "He must be very close now." Then the Witiko had gone a good distance the Indian went after the Witiko by going behind him instead of ahead of him. The Indian went up a tree and the Witiko came to him again and stood right under the tree. The Indian defecated right in his eyes. The Witiko said, "This is strange. I never saw excrement fall from the clouds be- fore." The Indian had a spear and threw it down in the back of the Witiko fs neck and it was sticking right out of the Witiko. The Witiko went back to where the rest of the Witikos were stopping where he had left them. They tried to take the spear from his neck but could not do it on account of the noise he was making, because they were hurting him. He told them to go for another Witiko who would know better how to take out the spear - one who would have more sense. They brought the other Witiko and instead of taking the spear out he drove it in and killed him. The other Witikos said, "He will have to be eaten now he has been killed." When they finished eating him they said, "We will all have to go off different ways, no two to- gether. After we go off," they said, "if two meet, they will have to fight and if one murders the other, the murdered one will be eaten and will be our next feed." AI:U Girl in Menses Hut Escapes Witiko Moose Factory Ellen Smallboy RF:1933 Once there was a girl who was put outside the camp at first menses in a little tent. She went out of her tent to get some wood and saw one of those cannibals. He had killed all the people that were in the camp, but the girl did not know if he had eaten them. She ran off. She cut the tails off her snowshoes so the cannibal would not know the direction she was travelling. It was a long time before the cannibal realized there was anyone left in the camp. He ran after the girl when he finally saw her track. She had crossed over her own tracks and circled in order to confuse him. At last she climbed a tree. She had taken her kettle along with her and she sat on it and made water in it. When the cannibal came to the place she was hiding he made a fire under the tree. She spilled the kettle and the contents went all over the cannibal. He looked up sand said, "What is this?" Then he tasted it and said, "I am sure this tastes like urine. That girl must surely be up in that tree." Ne began to talk to himself and wondered if he had a wi:se [the fatty covering of the third chamber, or omasum, of the caribou's stomach] like other animals. He cut himself open in the stomach and fat poured out. He then fastened himself together with a stick and pulled out some lacy fat. The girl saw</page><page sequence="6">62 Arctic Anthropology XVIII- 1 that he was eating fat. As soon as daylight came she saw him make tracks off in the direc- tion from which he had come. The girl stayed in that place for a long time. She did not go back until spring. She lived alright and came to some people and was saved, but she never knew whether her people had been eaten. Group AII9 Witikos We present two versions of atalokan describing the cannibalistic activities of a witiko father and son. Our informants reported having heard this story at Moose Factory, Albany, and Newpost (Abitibi). The first ver- sion (II :l) is a detailed account of two witikos believed to have killed ten families. The power of conjurors is central to this story. Frequently a witiko possesses extreme strength and only trickery or the power of a conjuror can subdue the witiko. The second version (II: 2) was told by Ellen Smallboy, Harvey Smallboy fs mother. It is an abbre- viated account of the same incident. In this version the first event referring to the murder of ten families is omitted and the focus of the tale is not on conjuring. Another ver- sion of the tale which appears in Teicher (1960:36-37) was recorded by Skinner at Albany. AII:1 Witiko Father and Son Bested By Conjurors , Version One Moose Factory Harvey Smallboy JMC:1933 Once there were two men, a father and a son, who always went off together to do murder. They always looked for a place where people could be taken unawares. It was nearly spring and the son walked about until he found no less than ten canoes all together at a lake. He said to his father, "I found ten canoes along the lake." The father replied, "I guess all those canoes will be in use this spring." The father and son continued on and stopped around the point to sleep. Later, they were trying to fish and cover- ing their lines so as not to be seen. All of a sudden they saw ten families coming across the ice to meet the summer. The ten families put up two large tents. The father said to his son, "We will not touch them until toward morning when they are well asleep." The father had another son who was not a murderer, but the man did not know where he was. In the morning the father and son went to look at the ten families while they were sleeping. The father said, "We will each go into a tent, you in one and I in another." And this they did until they had killed all ten families . The old man met a strong man and was nearly mastered by him, but the old man finally managed to get clear of him at last and killed him. When he was finished killing his lot he went to his son and asked, "Are you finished killing your lot?" The son answered, "Yes." The father said, "Bring a light over to this tent. I want to see who is this who is so strong." The son brought a light and the old man came to find it was his other son. He started to cry, "You know this is your older brother?" when he saw he had killed his own son. The younger brother began to cry for his brother. Then the father said," What good is it for us to cry like this? He is the first one we will eat. We have lots of meat now, enough to last us the whole summer." In the summer they gave up their murdering ways and lived like other Indians and ate what other Indians ate. At last a man started to wonder how he could make away with the two murderers. This man had a daughter and two sons. The two sons tried to give the sister to the young murderer. So he married the girl. The father and the son and his new wife still travelled together. So when winter came along they started their same game of murdering and eating people, but the girl never helped them do anything like that. The girl continued to live just as she had before. She also told her mother's people everything her husband and father-in-law were doing. When summer came again the three of them lived with the rest of the people and there was no murdering. Winter came again and they started looking around for people to kill. The son often went off and left his wife with his father. The girl and the father would camp together. Once when the son was off he found some people who were starving. When he came home he told his father, "I have found some starving people. I found some people not worth killing because they are so poor." The father said, "Do not worry about it. Hunt and give some game to these people to fatten them." The three of them went off to see these poor Indians, and all lived together. The young man started to hunt and killed a moose. He gave this to the starving people to eat and they started to fatten up a little. The man who was starving had a large family including a small child still in arms. The father told a woman who was starving, "Bring the baby. I will hold it while you are eating." The woman passed the child to the old man to hold. While he was holding it the baby started to cry. The old man was feeling the child below the ribs to see if it was fat enough and squeezed the baby. The starving people did not know who the murderers were. They didn't know those</page><page sequence="7">Flannery, Chambers and Jehle: Cree Witiko Accounts 63 feeding them intended to kill them. The wife of the young man told them on the sly, "You know these people are going to kill you." The people started to think how they could save themselves from being murdered. The man thought of a plan to save his own life. He knew well enough he could save his own life by running away, but also knew he could not take his wife and children. One morning when it was very wild, snowing, drifting and blowing hard, the man said, "This will be a fine day for me to run off." He had a lot of moose bones still from the moose that had been killed. He told the murderers, "The tent is getting very dirty from cooking inside. I think it is time we shifted camp." The old man said, "Fine. It is time to shift the tent. The wood is getting scarce around here, too." The murderers got ready to shift the tent. The man said to them, "I will not come now to where you are shifting. I shall come tomorrow. I will smash up my moose bones and boil them. If I drink the liquor perhaps it will fatten me." The murderers said, "All right. Come tomorrow. We will wait for you to come to us." The murderers went on ahead. The father told the son, "Look for a good place where there is plenty of firewood to make the tent." They were planning on doing the murdering there. When they finished putting up the tent they went to sleep. The next day was an awful and wild day. It was snowing and drifting. The tracks of anyone walking would be covered up. As soon as the starving family had gotten rid of the murderers, they took off in another direction altogether. The man knew of a large lake and made for it . At last he came to the lake with his wife and children. The lake was round. They went to the center of the lake and came back just a little way from where they had first stepped on the lake. The man knew all about this lake. He knew where it always drifted up very high. So they went there and dug a hole into the snow and climbed into it, man, wife, and children. The hole was made in a high snow bank. All were uneer the snow and before long the hole was drifted over. They stayed in that hole. The next day the murderers began to think the starving people were very long in coming to see them. The old man was getting cross. He decided to kill them where he had left them, so he went to see where they were. He went alone without his son. When he came to the place they had camped he saw no signs of them; the tent was drifted over. There was not a sign of a track anywhere. The old man started to call out with all his might. When he was finished calling out he saw a very fresh look- ing path. He went after the starving people. After a short distance he lost the track and could not find it. Again, he called out and his voice was something like thunder. The sound would go up - that was where he was getting his help from above. When he stopped calling he saw two steps of the path quite plainly. Then he tried calling a third time, but it was no use and he did not see any- thing. So he turned and went back to see his son and his daughter-in-law. The old man was very mad when he came back to the tent. He blamed his daughter-in-law for telling the family. He said to her, "It is you that has been telling them. That is how they found out what we were going to do." She replied, "I never told them. It is you. Your hearts are making a noise at night while you sleep." The daughter-in-law was a con- juror and knew exactly where the starving people were through her conjuring thoughts. Her scheme had always been to try to save the people she knew were to be murdered. The next day they all went off to look for the starving family. They reached the place where the old man had given his last call be- fore turning back. There they cut down a small sapling and cut the sapling into three pieces. Each had a stick to probe the snow to find where the old path was. Finally, they reached the big lake by feeling for the path under the snow. They followed the path with no trouble until they got to the center of the lake where the starving man had turned sharply and headed back to the shore. But they lost the track and instead of returning to the shore as the starving man had done they went straight across the lake. They saw no signs of any trail on the other shore of the lake. Then they followed the shore of the lake feel- ing for the path with their sticks. The daughter-in-law knew exactly where the starving people were lying. So at last they came to the spot where the family had stood when they returned from the center of the lake. The daughter-in-law said, "You go ahead and start probing again over there," pointing in the direction of the family. She went off in the other direction and felt for the path. The father and son walked right over the starving people under the snow. Soon they gave up looking for them, although they still thought the people must be around somewhere. They never bothered to look for the people themselves, but looked only for their tracks . The daughter-in-law knew exactly the very spot where they were lying. The old man wanted to continue probing to find the tracks of the people near where they actually were hiding. His daughter-in-law said, "It is no use trying anymore. I have been probing all around here with my stick and have felt nothing at all." At last they all got tired of looking for them and stopped. The father said, "They must be very far</page><page sequence="8">64 Arctic Anthropology XVIII-1 away now . " The starving people stayed under the snow until the crust formed. Their tracks would not be seen on the crust. They waited until that time came and went off and left the lake. So they saved themselves. The murderers had a hard time after that and they kept up their murdering job. The old man was very fond of his daughter-in-law. However, the son always had it in his mind to kill his wife and eat her in the winter. The old man never wanted to let his daughter-in- law get fat. The young husband was always watching his wife to see if she was getting fat. He would cut his wife!s upper arm to see if there was any fat. The old man told his son, "You are making her cry now because you are cutting her. It is not worthwhile to eat her. She is too poor." In the summer the woman met other people and showed them where her husband had been cutting her arm to see if she was fat. Later, the two brothers of the woman were living with their mother. The brothers often went out with their brother-in-law. One day the young man told his wife, "I cannot hold on any long- er. I guess I will kill your brothers today." He went way off to a beaver loge to work beaver. After he left the woman told her brothers their lives were in danger and that they would be killed today. The old man and the woman fs father were sitting in the tent with her. There was a large stone by the fire on the opposite side of the tent. The brothers went off after the husband at the beaver loge. The old people stayed in the tent with their daughter. Her father got up and was going to throw out the stone. He said, "The stone is lying in the way." The stone was a very big one and was stuck in the sand, but finally he got hold of the stone and pulled it right up and threw it right out of the tent. The stone was so large that no other person could have lifted it. The old man watched the man moving such a big stone and throwing it. The three young fellows were working at the beaver lodge during this time. They had shut the beaver in a runway in the bank, not in his lodge. The young husband told one of the brothers, "You feel for the beaver." He had decided that when the brother was feeling for the beaver he would run a chisel into the back of his neck. Just as he was about to spear the man the other brother caught the chisel and knocked it to one side so it missed. Then the brother being attacked jumped up, took the chisel, and threw it away. The two brothers were very strong and were in no way frightened of the young murderer. They grabbed hold of the man and wrestled with him using only their hands. While one of the brothers wrestled with the murderer, the other ran to the lake and made a hole in the ice. Both the brother and the murderer were about the same strength and before the ice hole was finished they were tired out. The other brother came and started wrestling just as the murderer called out with all his might and it sounded just like thunder. So the brother called out too and his voice was far louder. They continued to wrestle while the other brother went to the lake and finished making a hole in the ice. When the hole was big enough to shove a person down into it they tried to throw the murderer in. At last, they got him in the hole and shoved him under the ice. The man was under the ice alive for a long time and he was singing. That is why the ice now makes a humming noise. The two brothers never left the lake until they were sure the man was not moving. Then they went back to the tent after finding out that the young husband was gone. When they^ came to the tent they started to sing out, "We have killed the one who was always wanting to kill us." They entered the tent and said, ^ "We have killed the one who always wanted to kill ^ us." The old man was sitting inside the tent so they said to him, "Come out. We will kill you, too. We do not want to make a mess of blood in our tent." The father was sitting bare- legged in the tent; he had been telling those in the tent about all the people he had killed, as he had expected his son to kill the two brothers . The old man crawled out of the tent; he did not walk. The brothers were outside holding their chisels on their shoulders. As the old man came out of the tent, the brothers struck both his legs with the chisels and broke them. So when his legs were broken the marrow came out of his bones. The brothers took the marrow from the old man's bones and shoved it in his mouth. As they did that they asked him, "Is it pretty rich?" The old man answered, "Of course it is rich. I have killed so many people it is bound to be rich." The brothers gave him a good clip on the head when he said that. So that finished the murderers. All: 2 Version II: Witiko Father and Son Bested by Conjurors, Version Two Moose Factory Ellen Smallboy RF-.193T A boy told his father, "I have found some Indians and they are pretty near starving." "Well, do not give up. You hunt as hard as you can. We will try to get them fattened up," the father told his son. The boy killed a big, fat moose and they all ate it. Soon</page><page sequence="9">Flannery¿ Chambers and Jehle: Cree Witiko Accounts 65 the other family was getting fat. The old man said to his son, "I guess they are pretty fat now." The father called one of the children away. The others heard the child calling out. The child cried when the old man was feeling him to see if he was fat. The son was married to another kind of Indian woman. She told the other people, "It is not real people I am living with. They are fat- tening you up for some reason." After the woman told them what the old man was after, the head of the group went to the old man. He told him, "Go ahead. I will catch up to you tomorrow. So the old man, his son, and daughter-in-law shifted the camp and went ahead. As soon as they were out of sight the other man and his family went off in another direction. It was snowing awfully hard at the time. The young man said to his father, "Let's play snowballs." They started to make snow- balls. The son put stones in the middle of his snow balls and threw them at his father. The old man did not know that the son had stones in his snow balls. The son his his father in the eye with one. The old man said, "I am sure you "have a stone in this . " They waited all day but the other family did not show up. The old man said, "I wonder why they have not come." The old man decided to go back to see what was keeping the family. He went to the old camp, but saw no trace of the people. He re- turned to his camp and told his son. The son wanted to fight his wife. "You must have told them," he said to her. The woman said, "Why do you think they would not know after you squeezed their child to see how fat he was?" The son jumped at his father, saying, "It is your fault that they left us when you listened to them and they sent us right off." The family which the old man had fattened up stayed under a snowdrift along the shore of a lake. No one could find them and nothing hap- pened to them. They lived, but they expected the old man to come after them. The old man used to finish off any starving Indians he found. Another time he had two fellows he was keeping. They were very much afraid of him. They thought the old man was awfully strong. One said to the other, "How are we going to get out of this?" The young fellows used to break off sticks from trees when they travelled with the old man and his family. They were going to try and kill him if they had the chance. The old man used to say, "I wonder why you boys are always fooling with sticks." One day the two young fellows went off with the old man's son to kill beaver. The son was making a hole in the ice. The boys kept tell- ing him, "Make it big enough! Make it big enough!" Actually, they were planning to jump on the son. The son suspected them, though. The boys jumped on him and pushed him into the hole in the ice. The man was yelling and mak- ing an awful noise while they were working on him. The ice was very thick. They could hear him breaking up the ice while he was fighting under the water. After the young fellows had put the son in the ice hole they went back to camp . They told the old man, "We have killed your son, the one who always wanted to kill us." The old man said, "Well, you can start now and kill me." So they jumped him. The old man said, "Let me speak a little while." He asked that they bury him and put his body right. "If you do this you will live to be very old," he told them. The woman was sitting there crying hard for her husband who was shoved under the ice. Her brothers were the ones who had killed her husband and were going to kill her father-in-law. She was close to making her brothers mad because she was making such a fuss over her husband. The boys told her, "You are kicking up an awful fuss. But you would not have lifed if it had not been for us." The woman was covered with scars and cuts on her side because her husband had been fighting with her. He used to cut her on the side to see if she was getting fat enough to eat. One time when he made her cry her father-in-law had said, "Why do you have to see if she is fat enough?" So the old man had stopped the son from doing that. B. TEBATCIMON: LONG AGO STORIES Group BIj Witikos The theme unifying the tebatcimowin is that Witikos are killed by their intended victims ; either trickery or conjuring is employed to overcome them. In all the tales Witikos are burned to destroy their powers. Several ele- ments of interest occur in this group; for example, in the two versions of "Witiko Burns in his Own Fire" (BI:1,2) children are visited by Witikos, but their memories of the visit are erased. Teicher (19-60:3^-35) includes a story recorded by Speck at Waswanipi which is similar to our versions. Scapulimancy is practiced in "Child Calls the Atuc by Scapulimancy" (BI:3). The reference in "Witiko Burns in his Own Fire II" (BI:2) to children playing in a very "crazy" way suggests the children may have done something, perhaps per- formed scapulimancy, to cause the appearance of the Witiko. "Woman Used as Bait to Trap Witiko" (BI:5) is similar to a Tete-de-Boule folklore reported by Davidson in 1928 (Teicher 1960:U2).</page><page sequence="10">66 Arctic Anthropology XVIII-1 BI:1 Witiko Burns In His Own Fire- Version One Albany Bab Wesley RF:1935 There were two families living in tents. The children were playing when they saw some- thing. They thought someone came to them. He asked, "What is the name of the one who kills the devil (Witiko)?" Of course, it was the devil (Witiko) himself who came to them. The children told him, "ke:dja:ctu:di:ne:ho:" . That was the name of the old man who made the children believe he could kill the devil. The children turned around and the devil blew on them twice and they forgot everything about who was talking to them. It was getting dark when someone called out the old man's name. Someone was calling him, "We want you to come. We are eating now." Actually, the Witiko wanted the man to come out so he could get him. The old man went out with his plate and his knife to go to the other tent. The Witiko jumped the man, grabbed his knife, and cut his throat. The old man had left his family in the tent. His wife said to the others, "I wonder why it is that they only called the old man out to eat." "Oh!," said the children when they remembered what they had told the Witiko. It was only at that moment that their meeting came back to their minds. So they made a light and looked at the old man's tracks leading from the tent. It was all bloody where the Witiko had run off with his body. An Indian who was a conjuror followed the tracks of the Witiko. He saw the Witiko !s fire and saw that he was cutting up the old man. The conjuror came close and asked, "Where did you get this old man?" The Witiko said, "From away over there. There are lots of them there." The conjuror was going to take the knife but the Witiko said, "Do not take it. Do not take it. You will cut your- self." The man said, "It does not look as if it is very sharp. I will sharpen it for you." Then he told the Witiko, "%, that meat looks good." As the Witiko reached to fetch him a piece he stretched his neck and the conjuror slit his throat. The Witiko fell down in his own fire and was all burned up. BI:2 Witiko Burns in His Own Fire- Version Two MoQse Factory Ellen Smallboy RF:1935 Once there were two girls sitting in a tent and they were playing in a very "crazy" way. So the Witiko came in their tent and asked the girls, "What is your father's name?" They told the Witiko. He told them to put their thumbs across their foreheads so they would forget they had seen him. Then the Witiko went out. The parents returned to the tent but didn't know the Witiko had been there un- til all of a sudden one of the girls said, "There was someone who came to see us here." The other girl said, "She is telling lies." So they did not pay attention to it. There was another tent of people in the camp and that family was cooking beaver. The father of the girls was expecting they would invite him over. So when the Witiko called his name he thought it was the other family calling him, and he went out of the tent. The Witiko was right behind the camp near the woodpile. When the other family had finished cooking the beaver they called out to the man. When he did not come to their tent they went to see about him. The man's family told them, "Well he went out long ago. He went the first time you called." The other family said, "We never called for him but once. We did not call him earlier." They could not find the man. They became frightened when they could not find him. It was night so they lit some bark as a torch and went looking all around for him. They saw the tracks of the Witiko lead- ing from the pile of wood. He had run off with the man. You could see the blood on the Witiko1 s tracks. It was then that the chil- dren said, "You know it was true. Someone came and saw us here." The Witiko had taken the man along the trail they travelled. So they followed the trail and at last they saw the Witiko at his fire. He was starting to eat the man he had cooked. They tried to sneak up on the Witiko. The man's wife got a long pole with a snare on one end and snared the Witiko from a short dis- tance. There was a knife sticking up which he was going to use to kill someone else. Anyway as soon as she got the line around his neck they all pulled it hard. The Witiko grabbed forhis knife but missed it. The people killed him. They burned the Witiko in his own fire." BI:3 Child Calls the Atuc by Scapulimancy Rupert House Emma Kitchen RF:1938 When a father and mother were off killing beaver one of the children held the shoulder blade of an animal to the fire [a form of divination which children were forbidden to imitate]. The other child tried to stop him, but he persisted anyway. An Atú:c (Witiko)</page><page sequence="11">Flannery^ Chambers and Jehle: Cree Witiko Accounts 67 came to them, but he did not kill the children. The two little "boys were outside and saw the Atuc coming. They hid themselves behind the brush on each side of the doorway and the Atuc did not see them. The Atuc would have killed and eaten them if he had seen them. There used to be many Atuc long ago. When the father and mother came back they saw the tracks of the Atuc. The tracks came around to the tent and went off to one side. The Indians know the Atuc has been near be- cause he uses the tops of trees, the brushy pointed part, tied on his feet for snowshoes. The Indians recognize the tracks. The children told their parents when they returned. Their father went off to track the Atuc. It was dark already when he came to the Atuc. The Atuc had a very big fire and it ap- peared that he was roasting something. The man came up behind the Atuc and shoved an ice- chisel in his back and burned the Atuc in his own fire. BI:U Witiko Is Reflected in the Grease Moose Factory Harvey Smallboy JMC:1933 A young man got married and was off in the bush with his young wife. The young man used to go off hunting while his wife remained in the tent. He killed a very fat moose one day when he was out hunting. He brought home the moose !s heart and gave it to his wife to boil in the kettle. The heart was very fat and as it cooked a lot of grease was melted in the kettle. The wife took the kettle off the fire when the heart had cooked and removed the heart. She looked at the grease and said, "0 my, there is an awful lot of grease." She looked at the grease again and saw a Witiko looking in from the top of the tent. The grease was acting as a mirror. She did not turn her head to look up at the Witiko, but saw his reflection in the grease. The young husband was lying in the tent . He had his bow and arrow near him. The young wife threw herself alongside her husband and was kissing him. When she did this she told him in a whisper that the Witiko was looking at them through the top of the tent. The young man got up nonchalantly, took his bow in his- hand, fitted an arrow in it, held it hori- zontally, and said, "This is just how I killed the moose today." Then he fired at the Witiko1 s heart. The Witiko came down to the ground in an awful thump. The young man heard his arrow hit the trees outside after it had gone clean through the Witiko. He then took all the covering off of his tent, made a large fire and burned up the Witiko. BI:5 Woman Used as Bait to Trap Witiko Fort George . Old Mateskwinamau JCM-.1932 Some Indians started from Long Point, about 30 miles from Fort George and went up Big River to their wooden beaver traps inland. They caught two beaver, one old one and one medium-sized one, and then came down Big River to the falls. One Indian's brother was with him. The brother skinned the beaver. As soon as he had done so, he saw a fire across the river and said to his brother, "Start. Go down the river," for he knew someone was over there. So they paddled down the river to the fishing place and they heard someone calling. It was in the spring and they felt cold. New ice was forming and the water froze, so they could not paddle on account of the ice. The man then said to his brother "Tie a beaver skin over the bow of the canoe." The brother did so, and as soon as he did they started down the river. When they reached the mouth of the river there was no ice. Then they started for home and walked all night. After they got home they went to sleep. After sleeping, as they got up one said, "The fellow whose fire we saw is coming. He must be a Witiko." At night they made a conjuring house, but the man inside it could not speak. So he said, "Find a nail." A nail was found and it was shoved into the conjuring house. Then the man inside started to speak and said, VNow I can speak." He knew a Witiko was coming so he said, "We will make a trap for him." An old woman was there. He added, "We will use her for bait." The old woman was lying asleep on the back of the tent. The man hid himself inside the tent and left her visible for bait. When the Witiko came crawling into the tent, he was caught in the trap. The men then stabbed the Witiko to death and then burned his body. Group BII: witiko s In "witiko Carries Fingers of Victims, Versions One and Two" (BII:1,2), a young man is discovered carrying the fingers of those he has killed; a similar theme is found in Teicher (1960:37-38). The long account of Sakikweo, "Sakikweo Defeats No^teamo the Cannibal Indian" (BII:3), concerns a struggle between two families. Conjuring as a tool against the witiko is a dominant theme. The final story, "witiko Compares Human and Beaver Meat" (BII:U), is a problematical one. Although told as a true account , there are several</page><page sequence="12">68 Arctic Anthropology XVIII- 1 folklori e elements that suggest it is a tebatoimowin , and we have therefore included it in this section. Moreover, our informant did not provide historical referents to a specific locale or known individuals, as is the case of the historical witiko incidents presented in the third section of this paper. BII:1 witiko Carries Fingers of Victims, Version One Fort George Old Mateskwinamau JMC:1932 In the olden times some Indians had been out in the bush hunting. A young fellow told his grandfather, "I dreamed a dream. Someone told me (in the dream) to keep this Indian finger." The grandfather said, "If you kill a caribou, cut off his thumb [sic]." The young man said, "No, I won't." The young man killed people and kept the little fingers of the people he killed. The old man said to him, "When you kill a caribou, take off the caribou1 s thumb and keep it." But the young man said, "No, I wonft do that. Only an Indian finger." The young man got wild and crazy and killed all the people. The old man said to his wife, "That young fellow is coining." The young man was coming to kill the old man and all the old manfs party. The young man came there and made a fire, and the old man took him into his own tent. The old man had some bear grease melted in a kettle. He said to his own brother, "Open your shirt and show your bare skin. Watch if the young fellow wants to jump on you, and if he does spill this grease in the fire. If I see him wanting to jump on you, I1 11 shove him into the fire as you spill the grease in the fire." So the grease was spilled into the fire. They shoved the young man into the fire and choked him. After they had killed him they burned his body, and they found a lot of lit- tle fingers that he had kept. BII:2 Atuc (witiko) Carries Fingers of Victims - Version Two Fort George Sarah John RF-.1937 Long ago a young man dreamt he was eating one of his own fingers, the first joint of his little finger. His grandfather told him, "The reason you are dreaming like that is because you will eat a caribou leg." The young man did not listen to that old man and said, "How can I eat caribou1 s leg when there are no caribou here?" "You will see it yet," the old man told him. At last they came to the point where they had to eat one of their own. The young fellow came toward a tent where there was another family. The old man had been chiseling beaver and they saw the young man coming to their camp to kill them. He had a bundle on his back and they took it from him and they found that he had the fingers of all those he had been killing. They took him back to their camp. They were boiling the beaver they had killed in a big kettle. The people pulled off their clothes and were naked. The people gave the young man something to eat and he did not eat it. They gave him something to drink and he did not drink it. They called him Atuc. When that man was cooking something in the big kettle the Atuc shoved the man; he tried to shove him in the boiling kettle. The ket- tle upset on himself and the Atuc was burned. The people told the Atuc, "That is what you wanted, the reason why you did not listen to what the old people told you. If you had lis- tened to them you wouldn't be burned like that." The Atuc died and the people cut him up in pieces and burned him. His heart was ice all over and did not burn for a long time. BII:3 Sakikweo Defeats No teamo the Cannibal Indian Albany Harvey Smallboy JMC:1933 Once there was a man called "No: te: amo:1 . He was ahead of all the Indians. He got ahead of them in everything, in everything they did. Another Indian had a strong neck; he was called "Sa:kikwe:o:" and he was stronger than No^teamo. No^teamo was afraid of Sakikweo. Once Nohteamo went off by himself to walk for awhile. He met Sakikweo and Sakikweo knew he was afraid. So next time Sakikweo put a line around his own neck so his face would swell up and Nohteamo would not recognize him. When Nohteamo met Sakikweo he looked hard at him, but he could not recognize who it was. So they started to talk to each other. Sakikweo said to Nohteamo, "I found beaver in a little creek as I was coming along. Come with me to- morrow and we will chisel the beaver." Nohteamo answered, "All right. I will come with you in the morning." As Sakikweo left he turned around and said, "I am Sakikweo." Nohteamo said to himself, "What does he say? He says he is Sakikweo?" Sakikweo replied, "Oh! I am only telling you I will be here about this time tomorrow morning." Nohteamo was a Witiko. He had two sons who</page><page sequence="13">Flannerijy Chambers and Jehle: Cvee Witiko Accounts 69 always helped him with his butchering when he had killed people. Sakikweo also had two sons . The next morning Sakikweo was the first to get to the beaver lodge. He took his sons along with him and they brought their bows and arrows . They started to cut stakes to stake up the creek. They had stored the bows and arrows under the snow half way between their camp and the beaver lodge so the weapons would not be seen. No^teamo came at last with his two sons. The four young men then cut the stakes to dam up the creek. Sakikweo's sons tried to be on the ice while the other young men were in the bush cutting stakes . The two old men cut the ice where the stakes were to be placed. Sakikweo 's sons went after their bows and arrows. Then they watched for the other two young fellows and hid close to the path. The two sons of Nohteamo had their arms up over their heads carrying stakes on their right shoulders when the other young men fired and shot them in the heart and killed them. The young men then came down to the ice where the two old men were working. They jumped on No^-teamo and shoved him down into the hold which had been cut for stakes. They shoved No^teamo head first into the hole until he was in to his waist and he drowned. Sakikweo and his two sons went ahead and killed the beaver. Every time they passed the body of No^teamo they gave him a poke with their chisel and said, "This is the one who was always brave." No^teamo had a wife who was always helping him in his cannibal work, and he also had three daughters. All of a sudden his wife came to Sakikweo and his sons. She had been coming to give her husband help in killing Sakikweo and his sons. No^teamo's daughters and three other women came with the wife. No^teamo always kept one or more women who would be murdered only when the family was hard up. At this time they had three women they were keeping. No^teamo's widow came to Sakikweo and his sons with a heavy load. The load consisted of a big ball with a handle attached so it could be used as a club to kill with. She also had a bag with her. Sakikweo and his sons told the widow, "We have killed your husband now." She said, "I wonder who could be clever enough to kill him. No one could kill him." They replied, "Come and see him. He is soaking in the water." When she saw him she threw off her bag and was ready to fight for her dead husband. The bag seemed awfully heavy and made an awful bang when she threw it down. Sakikweo1 s two sons came running with their bows and arrows and said to the other women,1 "You women who were kept for food, stand to one side." Three of the women stood apart from the others. One of No teamo's daughters wanted to go with those three women, but the women drove her away saying, "You go away. It was you that got a small share of human flesh this morning and you thought your share was too small." The two sons knew that Nohteamofs daughters and widow controlled the other women so they killed the daughters and the widow. So then the three women were spared. Sakikweo and his sons then had a look at thè widow's bag which had made such a noise when she threw it down. Inside the bag she had half of a woman's body. There was no more of No^eamo after that. BII:U witiko Compares Human and Beaver Meat Attawapiskat Arthur Edrington RF-.1935 There was once upon a time an old man and he was always with his old wife. He was a sort of beggar. He would go along with other Indians during the summer. When the winter came he would think of the Indians as becoming animals. He would become a cannibal. He liked to eat people and the Indians didn't like him in the winter because of that. They would try to get away from him and he would find another family and go off with them. Then he found his son-in-law and his daugh- ter who was thirty years old. She had a lit- tle baby. He was staying with them in the migwam. One day he was in there and his son- in-law was gone. He and his wife and little grandson, just a little chap, were there. The little one was running around and the witiko grabbed the child and said to himself, "Oh, he is fat and will make a good meal for me." He was thinking how to get hold of him. The same evening his son-in-law returned before sunset and brought some caribou meat. They were hav- ing a meal of that and witiko had some meat on a ponask (roasting stick) and he started to eat. "Bring my grandson. I will feed him off my ponask," he said. He had taken into his mind to get that grandson. While he was put- ting the meat in the grandson's mouth all of a sudden he made a sound like the baby was chok- ing. Witiko said, "My grandson is choking." The mother said, "Bring him! Bring him!" The witiko said, "I will be able to get it out of him. " He grasped the child and started to run with him out of the tent. As he passed through the door he grabbed something and really choked him and killed him. He pretended he was sorry and was weeping. That night he and his wife stayed there and he told his son-in-law and daughter, "You bet- ter go off. I will come along later after I</page><page sequence="14">70 Arctic Anthropology XVIII- 1 put away the body." So they all -went off and left him by himself in the tent. A couple of hours after they had gone he started to think, "Well, I will have a good meal now." So he roasted the baby over the fire. He had a beaver there too. He said, "I will see which one tastes better." When they were well roasted he tried the child and said, "He is pretty good." Then he took a taste of beaver and said, "Oh, I think the beaver is a little tough. I had better have my grandson because he is nice." Then he took some and said, "Oh! It is very good." The baby was half of the meal for him. For the other half he took the beaver to fill himself. In the summer he would be the same as any- one else. He wasn*t killed because he would always get ahead of the others somehow. He was always up to that. That was his trade. He was getting to be an old man then. C. HISTORICAL WITIKO INCIDENTS A number of accounts of actual witiko in- cidents are included in the narrative collec- tion from James Bay. Virtually all these stories involved relatives of our informants or were events in which our middle-aged or elderly informants had participated as chil-, dren or young adults. The stories, therefore, recount actual events which occurred in the latter half of the 19th century. Frequently witiko accounts were recorded after informants described situations involving starvation and hardship, a topic ever on the minds of the bush Cree. Seasonal game shortages are character- istic of the region; famine and starvation in winter were yearly threats in their lives. Nearly every older informant recalled that a relative had starved to death. We stress, however, that the period of fieldwork in the 1930s followed several decades of extreme game shortages , a period that has been termed "the starvation years." The stories presented here involve either cannibalism or witikos ; there are many other accounts of starvation that do not involve these themes. One of the most striking and poignant aspects of the starvation stories is the desperate means to which individuals re- sorted to avoid cannibalism, for example, the consumption of human and animal excrement as well as all forms of organic materials (hides, clothing, bark and mosses) and prized hunting dogs. The strong group ethic for the sharing of food and mutual aid in times of stress is also reflected in these narratives. We have not included in this paper a number of stories that make reference to Witikos, such as Witiko scares, warnings given to chil- dren, or stories that deal primarily with con- juring. Although our stories pertain to a period when much of the traditional Eastern Cree culture remained intact, it is clear from several informants1 comments that by the turn of the century increasing pressures were being brought to bear on the native population to submit suspected or known murderers to in- formal or legal trial. Attempts were also made to dissuade Indians from following the traditional practice of executing those be- lieved to have become human witikos (see also Preston 1975:116-129). Attempts to cope with individuals who were thought to have become witikos or who ex- hibited aberrant and potentially dangerous be- havior are illustrated in the stories. The coping mechanisms range from isolation and ostracism to toleration of such deviant in- dividuals , but it is difficult to isolate cul- tural factors which might account for differen- tial handling of known or suspected cannibals. Moreover, there does not appear to be a con- sistent set or circumstances in which cures were administered or effected, and in some cases there was a return to normal behavior without treatment. We suspect the mechanisms for handling threatening individuals varied due to factors of group composition and the personality, age, and kinship ties of the transgressor. Group sanctions likely were af- fected strongly by whether or not cannibalis- tic acts were committed under starvation con- ditions. With respect to cures , a better understand- ing of the native perception of the range and limits of normality, and of states of health and illness, is needed to determine at what point the witiko illness was considered re- versible or was believed to have progressed too far for treatment. Several cases indicate that despite the strength of the cultural prohibi- tion on eating human flesh, cannibalism did not lead inevitably to mental disturbance or aberrant behavior (cf. Teicher 1960:110; Smith 1976:23). There are a number of instances in which individuals were forced to consume human flesh in the face of starvation but recovered without treatment to lead normal lives. Two cases illustrate that cannibalism was not necessarily repetitive. In the first a man was encountered with the heads of two of his children on his toboggan. He explained that he had eaten the remainder of their bodies. It was emphasized by the narrator that the man behaved normally thereafter and was not feared, perhaps due to the fact that he had made no attempt to conceal his actions. The second case concerns a woman and her children who consumed small bits of her dead husband over a period of time to keep alive. Later the woman was said to be "just like us." Again, her ac- tions were not concealed; she openly admitted having eaten her husband. These individuals returned to a normal state; however, informants</page><page sequence="15">Flannery^ Chambers and Jehle: Cree Witiko Accounts 71 frequently stated that persons who committed cannibalism had a "strange look" in their eyes and had to be watched. Severe physiological stress can produce many symptoms associated with witiko behavior. Therefore, the recovery process in some instances may be recovery from the effects of near- star vat i on, rather than a process of overcoming guilt following viola- tion of the cannibalism taboo. As is evident in the Witiko literature, the traditional method of handling human witikos was by killing and burning them. We have noted that this practice was giving way to other methods of coping with witikos in the latter part of the 19th century. The following inci- dents reported by Hudson's Bay Company person- nel as having occurred approximately between 1867 and 1882 describe the killing of cannibals by several means other than by burning. The stories were related by John Corston, a non- Indian, and his sister, Jane Morrison, both of whom lived many years at Eastmain. Corston first made a general statement that in the old days if a person were "sick", he or she might be killed by a member of the family because they feared the sick person's spirit. Corston and Mrs. Morrison then recounted three events in which witikos were killed. The third event may not belong in this group of true accounts since intentional burial alive is uncharacter- istic of the Cree. Teicher ( 19-60:62) found only one case in his TO accounts of a witiko having been buried. In that situation the suspect had been stunned and was presumed dead, but following indications that he was still alive, he was unearthed and burned. All three incidents below occurred at Eastmain. Case I. A man suspected that his wife in- tended to kill and eat their young son who was ill. He killed his wife to protect the child, but the child did not survive his illness. In rage and frustration he then cut up his wife's body and ate her, a unique reaction for one who had killed initially because he feared his wife was becoming a witiko. Case II. The brother-in-law of a woman known to Jane Morrison was "sick and delerious." This woman told her mother-in-law that some- thing would have to be done or he would kill the children, one of whom was an ail- ing six-month-old. On one occasion the af- flicted man ran wildly out of the tent and could not be calmed. After a struggle they managed to bring him back inside. His mother tied him down and the wife strangled him, while all the other women in camp fled. The two women brought the body into the Post. Mrs. Morrison heard the Indians singing and drumming all night, presumably to exorcise the witiko. Burial took place the next day. Case III. Mrs. Morrison then continued with an account of another Eastmain man who had become "sick and delerious," The man's brothers, fearing that he would kill them, took him to an island and buried him alive. The wife told Mrs. Morrison's mother, wife of the Post manager, that she now was very much afraid of her in-laws. C, HISTORICAL INCIDENTS Group CI: witikos CI:1 Cannibals Believe Men Are Caribou Winisk(?) ca. l86o(?) Bab Wesley RF:1935 [The following incident probably occurred around Winisk, as the informant's mother (Madeline Sutherland) was born there and the cannibal was the mother's aunt. While the narrative contains the folkloristic elements of ice in the chest and the fact that the witiko could not be killed by gunfire, but only by burning, other aspects of the human witiko psychosis are present. The symptoms of illness are hallucinations, including the metamorphoses of human tracks and excreta into those of caribou, and the steadfast refusal to eat normal food. ] There was a woman her mother was talking about, her mother's aunt. That woman had a married daughter and grown-up sons, but she took back the daughter from the man she was married to. It was when it started to freeze in the fall that they saw signs that she had done away with her husband. That old fellow's ammunition was covered with blood. It showed the old woman was doing something. Later they knew she killed her sons as well. It was not until New Year's that they caught up with her. Two Indians saw tracks where the woman and daughter and the oldest son had been walking on the lake. The men saw signs they had gone to their old camp where they had a migtiam built up with turf. So the two men came to the camp. They knew someone was in there but they did not go in. They went around the mùgwam and then went away. They hadn't gone very far when one of them said, "I can't go any further. I'll have to stop." The other told him "Don't do it here! Wait!" But he had to sit down on the bank right there and defecate. Then they went on but they heard from far off the old woman calling to her daughter, "Look! There are caribou here. Here are the tracks and here is his dirt!" The woman and her daughter fol- lowed the tracks until they saw a single man</page><page sequence="16">72 Arctic Anthropology XVIII- 1 approaching them on the lake, so they sat and waited for him. When this man came up to them he spoke to the old woman and asked, "What is wrong with you?" They told him, "We are starving." He said, "Where is your husband?" She said, "I don't know. He has gone away long ago." The man then took the women back to where lots of people were living. When they got to the tent they fed them but the women didn't want to eat. As they breathed their chests sounded like ice inside. When the people put food before the two women water was running out of their mouths. So the whole group moved off. There were lots of children among them too. Because the old woman was carrying two axes and the daughter had one axe, men walked on each side of them. Even as they were going along the young woman, the daughter, called out that she was going to hit someone with the axe. One of the men fired at her and hit her in the ear. That didn't kill her and she made even more noise after they fired at her. He couldn't kill her until he used some of the old things [conjur- ing?]. So the only way was to burn them. They wouldn't eat the meat given to them, so they burned them. CI: 2 Relative Possessed of Cannibalistic Cravings Is Watched Kesagami? (ca. 1863) Ellen Smallboy RF:193T During her childhood she lived once with an Indian who was crazy for human flesh. This man was her mother's father's brother (uncle). He was an old man and her mother told them not to make a noise when he was lying on his face [in a state of depression]. Ellen did not know how dangerous he was. But her mother told the children not to make a noise, and they all sat around and there wasn't a sound out of them. He had a little girl about four years old and you know how children are when they get a cross fit and throw themselves down? And that is what she did. So he jumped up and grabbed the little girl and said, "Do you think you can master every- body?" He was squeezing her and he would have killed her if they hadn't stopped him. Ellen saw this with her own eyes. That same fellow would have killed his wife once, but his son hit him with an axe and knocked him senseless. Then he was alright again. It comes on them in sudden spells that they crave human flesh. Ellen doesn't know any cure for it. They are always in fear of their lives when they have to live with people like that. That same old fellow was living to one side (of the camp) with his family. He was very uneasy and didn't feel like a person at all. He was troubled. The little girl told Ellen that when they made a fire and the father was sitting there it looked like summer grass. This was the first fire they had made in a new camp and they were all sitting around. And all at once a summer rabbit came and fell down beside him. It made her father happy. He said, "I know I will live to see the summer." This happened in the winter and it was just like someone came and threw the rabbit down. He didn't say who it was that came to him. He just said, "I am alright now. This is meat that is thrown down to me." The old woman who was married to him said, "I am never afraid of him. It is only when he is sick (that) I don't like it." CI: 3 Woman Who Killed Ten Albany (ca. 1883) Madeline Sutherland RF:1933 [The following is one of; the more unusual narratives; it involves an Albany woman known to have killed as many as ten individuals without incurring retribution. The level of community tolerance for this individual is rarely documented in the Witiko literature. Although few details were provided regarding the personality of the woman, we suspect she was unusually persuasive or even charismatic to have convinced people to remain with her time and time again despite her reputation as a witiko. The woman may have been considered harmless in her old age as she was bedridden, but she nevertheless was not accorded a proper burial. -The young woman in the story, Char- lotte, is Madeline Sutherland's sister. She was a young widow who had been forced to aban- don her starving husband in winter to reach a lake where she could fish and stave off star- vation. ] An old woman and her daughter took Char- lotte and her three children to Kebuckak, way up the Albany River. When they reached that place the old woman wanted to take only the children further. So the old woman and the children went off and left Charlotte after the woman robbed her of her meat and belongings. Finally, Charlotte made a raft tied together with willow roots and used it to cross the river to find the woman and her three chil- dren. She finally reached the old woman, who had three sons living with her. One of these young boys approached Charlotte and said, "You go back because I think my mother wants to kill you." He gave her some matches and snare</page><page sequence="17">Flannevy, Chambers and Jehle: Cvee Witiko Accounts 73 twine. The old woman wouldn't give back the children and Charlotte was forced to go away without them. After the river froze the Indians started to come down to Albany. A man and a woman were coining down and saw Charlotte wearing rabbit- skin socks on her feet. She told them all that had been done to her. So the man made a fire, gai ve her something to eat, and then took her to his camp where they kept her until she was stronger. Then they took her down to Albany. All the children had been alive when Char- lotte had left the old woman. Later, the old woman !s sons came into Albany and told her that two of her children were dead, but they did not say that they had been killed. Another young man said that he had been walking around one day and had come upon the old woman's tracks and at that time only one child was with her. He followed the tracks and at last saw blood all along the path. He heard someone screaming. He followed the sound and found the old woman had broken the boy's leg and left him screaming out in pain. The young man was afraid to touch the child lest the old woman would return and kill him too. They never dis- covered what became of the other two children, but it was suspected that the old woman killed and ate them. This same old woman killed Madeline's aunt's daughter (her cousin). The mother ran to the rescue of the girl and found the old woman had the girl with a cord around her neck. The old woman held an axe in her hand and the mother was afraid she would be hit if she did anything to stop the woman. The old woman killed the girl and after she killed her she made a fire and burned the body. When the girl's father returned to his camp and found the girl had been killed he was angry and was going to kill the woman. The old woman managed to coax him and gave him a bladder of caribou grease. So he went away to set some snares. Later as the old woman heard her sons com- ing up the bank she thought, "Now they are coming to kill me." But they did not kill her. They spent the night and went off with the father of the dead girl in the morning. The mother of the dead girl was left alone with the old woman, but no harm came to her. The men came back and they slept there that night. The parents of the girl came back to see them and brought a lot of caribou meat. There was another relative to whom this old woman did mischief. A newlywed couple had lived together for about a month when the old woman persuaded the young wife to leave her husband and go off with her. The young woman would not believe the people when they told her the old woman would kill her. When they were travelling the old woman tried to starve the young woman. She took all the fish the younger one caught. When she took the food away the young woman would cry. The old woman's daughter-in-law pitied the young wife and told the old woman, "This girl is not a dog." But when she tried to give the young woman food to eat the old woman knocked it from her hand. Finally, when the young woman was weakened the old woman went after her, broke both her legs, and killed her. There were ten people she killed before she was found out. When she returned to Albany she became ill and she lay in bed for two whole winters and summers. A young girl went to see her once and the old woman told her, "I just see my path, a very narrow path, where I am going." The people at Albany thought it was very queer that an old woman who had been so bad would say she was so good. When the old woman died they had no funeral service for her. Bishop Harden was at Albany at the time and he got her buried. CI:h Cannibal Woman Craves Children Eastmain (ca. 1885) Jane Morrison RF:1933 There was one woman I knew who was from Rupert's House. She was married to an East- main man. She was a wicked woman and used to fight her husband and once hit him on the knee, making him lame. One winter they went off, taking her sister-in-law and the latter 's baby with them. In the spring when some . people were near the camp, one of the men spotted an old track and followed it to the migwam. That woman was there, unwashed and black with dirt, but she was white just around her mouth and on her fingertips. The man asked her, "How is it there are no fresh tracks around here? Where is your husband?" She told him that her husband had gone away one day and had never come back. Her sister- in-law was missing too and the baby lacked one arm. When they questioned her closely she owned up that she had killed and eaten them. They took her back to Rupert's House and they saw that when she passed through Eastmain she kept saying, "My, those little children look good to eat!" A man had to watch her very carefully lest she do something to the children. CI: 5 The Boy Who Refused to Hunt Attawapiskat (ca. 1895 ) Bab Wesley RF:1935 [The following story involves Bab Wesley's cousin (the sister-in-law) and was told to her</page><page sequence="18">74 Arctic Anthropology XVIII- 1 by her mother. The incident -was said to have occurred "not long ago." It is the only in- stance known to us of a young person exhibit- ing symptoms of witiko possession. Several references are made which indicate the son ex- hibited suspicious behavior sometime prior to his cannibalistic act. Pinching the flesh of his mother and aunt, his refusal to hunt or fish, and his lack of concern and care for fe- male relatives all point to aberrant behavior. Teicher suggests that the drying of the flesh of fictims is an unusual element, more in keep- ing with Witiko folklore than with witiko psychosis (1960:5^-55)5 but this narrative gives one true instance of this behavior. It is not fully explained in the narrative why the group with whom the mother was travel- ling refused to share meat with her. It seems this was a severe breach of prescribed be- havior, regardless of whether or not the woman had a son capable of hunting for her. Perhaps the woman had very tenuous kin ties or none at all with the group and could not prevail upon any members for support . ] There was a young boy living with his mother and he never wanted to go off with the man. He wanted to stay at Attawapiskat Post. His mother and her sister-in-law were travelling together. The boy used to go around pinching them while they were eating and would torment them. At last, the sister-in-law said, "I be- lieve this boy wants to kill us. This is the reason he torments us while we are eating." The boy said, "That is what I am trying to do." So the sister-in-law went to Akimiski (Island) for the spring while the geese were flying and left the boy and his mother with some other people where there were lots of Indians fishing. The boy's mother starved because those people would say, "You have a grownup son who could hunt for you." And they wouldn't give her anything when she asked for it. Then the boy and his mother were left be- hind when those Indians moved off. They say the boy really finished her off. When they came back from Akimiski before open water they found he had her all cut up; her hands and dif- ferent parts of her body were hung up. A girl came ashore with her mother and said, "Look at this meat hanging up." When she came to a hand she just fainted, she got such a start. They came across traces of that boy. They saw where he had been sleeping under an old tree. They found a body wrapped up in tenting and they said it must have been that boy. The people don't know what became of him, whether he starved or whether he was killed. There was an awful lot of game where he was staying, but he never tried to kill any. The people saw the place where he had been drying his mother's flesh. They were always afraid he would come after them. They said something was wrong with him; that he was crazy or something. He would never listen when they sent him out to bore hook holes in the ice to kill fish. C:I:T Starvation Cannibalism Moose Factory (ca. 1892) Ellen Smallboy and Easter Sabatim RF:1935, 1937 and RF:1935 [This story is a clear case of starvation cannibalism. Although the woman was referred to as a witiko there is no evidence of her having later developed a craving for human flesh.] This is a true story about an old woman. People used to say that the old woman ate her children when they were starving. At last her husband was left and they said she then ate him. Her dress of trade cloth was alive with nits of lice and she ate that, too. The husband got sick and his family starved all except one daughter and the mother. So the mother and the 15-year-old daughter came down the river (towards Moose Factory) and some Indians met them. The woman and this daughter made a raft; they had no canoe. They got as far as where the canoes pass from their hunting grounds in the spring and that is where they were found. The old woman didn't have on any clothes ; she was naked except for a breech- cloth. They asked her daughter, "What did your mother do with her dress?" Tne daughter said, "She boiled it for the lice laid along the seams." This was very early in the spring. There were no rabbits or anything. On the way down they ate bark. The woman was married to Easter's husband's brother. Easter and her husband and his mother and father were the ones who came upon this woman and her daughter when they were so weak they could hardly move, and brought them home. The daughter (their granddaughter) told them they had eaten the other children and the father after they were dead, but her mother said she had buried her husband right in the fireplace where the ground had thawed. The old people (the husband's parents) said when they first saw her she didn't look like a person. They thought there was some bad looks on her. They said she was a witiko but they didn't lay hands on her. She told the old people that there was no use to go look for the husband and children. They suspected that woman and thought if they looked they might find some- thing they wouldn't want to see. When the old people went then to the place where they had been camping in order to prove her story they couldn't find a sign of the husband and chil- dren, not even a bone or anything. It was the girl who told what had happened. The girl said she didn't know what she was</page><page sequence="19">Flannery, Chambers and Jehle: Cree Witiko Accounts 75 eating. She had to eat what her mother gave to her. She said she noticed that it was a little hand smaller than her own, "but she couldn't say anything because her mother would say, "Eat it. That is mi:tcim (meat)." But the girl was alright after that. She never had .spells . The people were careful about talking about those things among the younger genera- tion. They would not want that girl who was so young she hardly remembers it to hear any talk about it. Even if the girl herself sus- pected her mother they would tell her, "You are telling lies." C:I:8 A Cannibal Is Cured Bab Wesley RF:1935 [Bab Wesley insisted that the following account was "real" and not an atalokan, al- though the date or location of the event is unknown. She said it occurred "in the old days when Indians used to be starving." The cure is almost identical to one recorded by J. M. Cooper (in Fogelson 1965:9^-95).] There was a man who killed his children and his wife. The manfs brother came to him and as he was coming he heard him cutting away as though he was cutting wood. It was night and the man was sitting with his back toward his brother and he had a fire. The brother had an axe and came up behind him and gave him an awful crack but didn't kill him. So the brother took him back wounded to his own camp. He melted a big bladder full of grease and made the man drink that . It made him vomit bad. At last he started to bring up ice when he vomited and at last the ice was all yellow that he was bringing up. And when he started throwing up all that ice he started crying and thinking about what he had done. His brother did that to him to bring him to his senses. And he was a live person again. They used to hear him crying because he had killed his wife and children. CI: 9 Hunting Ground Hoax Moose Factory (ca. 1900) Easter Sabatim RF:1933, 1935 [As the following account illustrates, witiko scares sometimes proved to be hoaxes perpetrated by conjurors to their own advan- tage. In this account, related by one of the victims of such a hoax, a conjuror and his family from the Albany area (the Seagabusikums ) conspired to drive the Moose Factory Indians from their hunting and trapping lands by creating a false Witiko alarm. Before the de- ception was exposed the woman who had posed as a witiko almost lost her life. By this time the spring trapping season had passed; the ruse had given the Albany conjuror's group free reign of the land. ] Mr. Miller [a young HBC clerk] was in charge of Potapacon, a Company post up the (Moose) River. The families all came in for New Year - about three days before. All the Seagabusikums were there. As soon as the other people got there Miller and the others said that there was someone around who was a murderer. The Indians told them that there was something up there who would kill them. In the night Miller told all the women to go into the house and all the men to watch out in the tent with loaded guns. Only one didn't have the gun loaded. No one ever came, but they all believed the Seagabusikums' story. They thought if the person came he would kill them all and turn the house right over. Miller got scared and came down to Moose Factory with all the Indians except the Seagabusikums who went further up and said they were going to kill whoever it was. They were conjuring then and said they were going to drive him away by that means. Easter didn't see anything but the conjuror's family said they saw a cannibal whose feet were not even touching the ground and they acted as though they were very frightened. They pre- tended they were watching and were trying to kill it , but they were using an empty gun and pretending to conjure this thing. They had all the grounds to themselves. So Mr. Carey [the HBC Post manager at Moose Factory] was sent up in open water (e.g. after breakup) with John Sutherland. Sutherland said, "If I see anyone I am going to knock them with an axe." When they poled ashore they saw what appeared to be an old woman com- ing down the bank, her hair hanging down and all dressed up horrible looking, pretending to be a cannibal. So Mr. Carey said, "Don't you touch her, we will see who it is." But John Sutherland didn't listen and took up the axe. He was ready to kill her when somebody called out from far on top of the bank, "Don't you kill her! That is my mother!" This woman was old Je annette who is now living here and she nearly got killed as a witiko. That was the end of the scare. The Indians couldn't do anything about it. They used to get mad at Mr. Carey because they knew he wasn't afraid of conjuring. He said they were always conjuring up there and taking other peoples' hunting grounds. Group CII: "White Men11 As noted previously, our informants clearly</page><page sequence="20">76 Arctic Anthropology XVIII-1 differentiated Witiko and "white men" {ocipos) 9 the latter being persons which some have main- tained were merely interchangeable aspects of a diffuse concept of terrifying creatures. Strange and elusive "white men" in the bush were viewed with real apprehension but none of our data would indicate that they were con- fused with the Witiko being or human witikos. These strangers, sometimes referred to as white trappers, were said to be thieves and kidnappers, and to perform mischievous and evil deeds but they were not believed to be cannibals nor did they have the fantastic powers of Witikos. They could be seen or heard paddling or walking around in the sum- mer, whereas Witikos appeared only in the win- ter; they never came to the posts, but Witikos could be encountered everywhere . We therefore include here two stories of personal experi- ence with "white men" which show a marked contrast with the witiko narratives . CII:1 Mistapeo Reveals the Doings of the "White Men" Rupert House (ca. l88o) Simon Katebetuk RF:1938 One evening one of the old fellows went down to the bank of the river where they were smoking fish on an outside rack. Every day toward evening they would put on a cover so the fish wouldn't get wet. Nearly every morn- ing they found that they had lost some fish. So this evening the old fellow saw somebody down there running off from the path. This person had a white shirt, a waistcoat and a felt hat. He was one of the fellows who was stealing fish all the time. They asked the old man's son to scry (a form of divination) to see what was going on. He took a little tin bos and, seated near the fire, held it up to his eyes. "Well," he says, "those fellows who are taking the fish every night from the rack, there are three of them and one is a very old man, entirely gray- haired, and he is the one who is doing all the work. One night he nearly came into a tent to get after a child." Then he added, "You will see tomorrow morning what they have been doing." Then they asked this same man to go into the conjuring tent and he agreed to do so. They made the tent for him and after he went in Mistapeo began to talk and to tell about those three fellows. "There have been three fellows lurking about your tent for some time, and that is true," Mistapeo told them, and then he added, "Now I am going to drive them away. If you don't see any signs of them again at night I am telling the truth. But if you lose any more fish, then I am telling lies." Mistapeo also talked about a young woman who not long before had been missing for a whole day. Nobody had known where she was and toward evening one of her relatives met her as she was approaching the camp. When they got into the tent she seemed to be very sleepy all the time. So when the conjuror was in the conjuring tent Mistapeo was talking about that young woman. "It is those same fellows who made off with that girl," Mistapeo told them. And just the morning before the conjuring, one of the fellows went off to his otter traps that were set on the otter slides some distance apart. When he got there he found the first trap tied together with another one that had been placed far away. It was again the work of those three fellows. And that same day some of the people went to see their nets and found that those fellows had twisted the net over and over. ' After the conjuring they never saw any signs of those fellows nor heard them in the night. Nobody knows where they went. It was Mistapeo who drove them away from there. People say that when fellows like that want to take off a woman like the one Mistapeo talked about, they do like the doctor does when he wants to operate on someone. The pa- tient can't remember anything about it. So the young woman who was missing all day couldn't remember anything about it and that is why she didn't say a word. Some nights you could hear or see the ocipos walking outside the tent, even stealing fish out of nets. Such white people are never seen at the Posts. Nobody knows what they are doing. Recently (i.e. 1938) a fellow shooting the rapids near the Post saw three white men standing by a canoe and nobody knows who they are or what they are doing. It is that kind of people they look for when they are scrying. CII:2 White Men Kidnap a Small Boy Rupert House (ca. 1865-1895) Robert Stevens RF:1938 Some "white men" (Ocipos) took a boy from the tent and lost him and they have never seen him again to this day. They lost him early in the morning. The people were sleeping and the boy (the son of Simon Katebetuk' s uncle) was lying alongside his mother. When night had come the father had not put up his tent so they slept under the canoe. The little boy was not even able to walk yet ; he was only starting to crawl about. When they awoke in the morning the boy was gone. He had been sleeping in his mother's arms and when she awoke she thought he had merely moved a little</page><page sequence="21">Flannery^ Chambers and Jehle: Cree Witiko Accounts 77 way off. All they saw was one of his little stockings lying there. When they got up they looked all over as far as the baby could crawl. The father was crying as he walked around carrying his gun, looking for the boy. After a while the father wanted to find out what happened to the boy. Old Peter Trapper was asked to go in the conjuring tent, and he said, "All right." After the tent was built the conjuror went in and it started to shake. After Mistapeo was in there they asked if he could find out what happened. Mistapeo said, "There were some white men walking around. They took the boy." Then they asked Mistapeo if he could bring the one who had done it into the tent. Mistapeo said, "Alright. Sure I can do it." He called the white man into the tent and asked him, "Why did you take that boy?" The white man answered that he had only taken the boy for a little while but when he had seen the man looking for the boy with a gun he got scared. So he began to think he would take the boy for good. Some years later the same conjuror was in his conjuring tent again. Simon was there and the stolen boy!s father was also there. When Peter was conjuring at last they heard someone talking in there but it was not Mistapeo or the conjuror. The old father asked, "Who are you?" And the voice said, "It is I, I am your son whom you lost. I cannot come back again." "I am alright and well looked after where I am," he told his father. He said that he was going with some people on long trips. He was going with them already. Then again, the last time old Peter ever conjured the boy who had been stolen came in the conjuring tent. He began to talk and tell who he was. He said, "I am getting pretty old now. I am doing a lot of travelling around now. I have been a guide now for many years." So the people asked the fellow, "Prove it is you. Can you sing an Indian song?" Sure enough he commenced to sing an Indian song. He said before he started, "This is what I used to sing before I started long trips." He sang two songs and the people all knew the kind of songs he sang. When he finished the first song he started to call out cheering himself. He did the same thing when he finished the second song. When Peter Trapper conjured you could hear every word distinctly. CII:3 Kamuwit, the Half-Devil Rupert fs House Edward Neme gas JMC:193t Ka:nuwit was half devil. He wore white man's clothes and eventually wiped out all the Indians until he was at last all by himself. After he killed all the Indians he went back to his tent. It turned very hot. The snow was melting. Kanuwit ran and it was bad go- ing. Finally, he got to a camp where three people were. He tried to convince them he was a relative of theirs. Finally he killed them too. There was not supposed to be any but a very short summer then. There was very cold weather all the months of the year. After he killed those three he came across he was all by himself. Kanuwit disappeared and is re- ferred to today as ma:tcimánitu and witiko. Indians don't know where he came from or where he went to. The Indian theory is that he is the one the white man refers to as the devil. REFERENCES CITED Bishop, Charles A. 1975 Northern Algonkian Cannibalism and Windigo Psychosis.
