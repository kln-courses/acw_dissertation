INTRODUCTION This study is devoted to the least understood part of paintings in the Kyzil caves - the most impor- tant Buddhist sanctuary known today of the former Central Asian kingdom of Kutcha(ca. Ist-IIth century). It will attempt to identity and classify the small lozenge-shaped scenes characterized by the central pattern of the sitting Buddha, which are depicted on the vaulted ceilings of most Kyzil caves dedicated to worship. Those scenes preside over a few jataka scenes - or scenes of the Previous Lives of the Buddha - usually relegated to bottom rows of the vaults, and formally deprived of the motif of the central Buddha. The ceilings on which they are depicted may therefore be called the "mixed ceil- ings," as opposed to ceilings decorated only with "previous lives" scenes. The decor painted on ceilings of the worship caves was specially conceived to fit in the vaulted architecture of the cave shrines, and have no equivalent in wall paintings of traditionally built monasteries in Kutcha, such as Duldur-Aqur or Subachi, from which only a few fragments were saved, thanks to Pelliot., Whereas mostjdtaka scenes have been identified since the return of European explorers from Chi- nese Turkestan during the I9Ios,- little scholarship in the West has been devoted to scenes with a Let me thank Chen Shiliang, director of the Research Institute of the Kutchan Caves, who kindly welcomed me in Kyzil, and allowed the necessary photographs to be taken for this study. I am also grateful for Ma Shichang's help and sketches, and for G. Pinault's kind advice. I Pelliot explored the region of Kutcha from January to September 1907. Unfortunately, part of his diary has been lost, including his reports on the Kyzil caves. For the monasteries of Duldur-Aqur and Subachi, see S. Gaulier, M. Hallade, and L. Courtois, Mission Paul Pelliot, Koutcha IV: Temples construits (text), Editions Recherche sur les civilisations ADPF, Paris, 1982: 43-173, and, for the plates, L. Hambis (chief ed.), Mission Paul Pelliot, Koutcha III: Temples constru- its (plates), Paris, 1967; Duldur Aqur: pls. A-C, 28-45; Kyzil: pls. 269-270 and 272-274. Volumes on the cave sanc- tuaries await publication (Mission Paul Pelliot, Koutcha V-VI: temples rupestres). 2 The Chinese Turkestan has essentially been explored between 19o00 and 1915 by the Prussians Grtinwedel and von Le Coq (Kutcha was explored during 3rd expedition - Dec. 19o5-Apr. 1907 - and 4th expedition -June 1913-Feb. 1914), the Frenchman Paul Pelliot, the Russian S. Oldenburg, in 1909-191o, the Englishman Sir Aurel Stein, though he spent only one day in Kyzil (Innermost Asia, vol. 2: 5ol-5o2) and Japanese officers Tachibana and Nomura, sent by Count Otani (1902, 1908-1909, 1910, cf. J. Sugiyama, CentralAsian Objects Brought back by the Otani Mission, National Museum, Tokyo, 1971). The narration of these expeditions is summarized by P. Hopkirk in "Foreign Devils on the Silk Road", J. Murray, London, 1980, and H. Hirtel and M. Yaldiz, Along the Ancient Silk Routes, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1982: 24-46. Kyzil was actually discovered by the firstJapanese Otani mission in I9o02, but their notes 305</page><page sequence="2">central Buddha, to which more attention has been paid by some Chinese scholars. Griinwedel's identification effort was indeed more successful forjataka scenes painted on the ceiling of cave 38 than for scenes with a central Buddha painted on the mixed ceilings of caves 8 and 80, of which he provided but a formal description.3 The monotonous aspect of the scenes and the few number of hints left for the art historian's interpretation make the task of identification difficult indeed, and undoubtedly account for this delay in scholarship. The lozenge-shaped scenes with a central Buddha depicted on the ceilings were generally described by Griinwedel as "preaching scenes" or "Buddha scenes." Yet the feats of the Buddha they depict often differ from the "preaching scenes" illustrated on the caves' side- walls.4 They sometimes illustrate unfriendly assaults on the Buddha. A particular emphasis is placed, I believe, on demonstrating the Buddha's superiority over the gods and followers of other religions, on one hand, and on the act of almsgiving, on the other. They also illustrate parables painted in no other part of the Kyzil caves decors. Therefore they deserve a special study. I will concentrate on scenes painted in representative and complementary ceilings of three caves I have carefully selected in situ for this purpose: nos. 34, 80, and 171. Before describing those barrel-vault decors, let me recall very briefly some significant facts about the history and geography of Kyzil within the Kutcha kingdom. Kyzil and the Kutcha kingdom The history of the Kutcha kingdom was traced in detail during the I9Ios by the French scholars Cha- vannes and Levi.5 It may be briefly summarized as follows: were totally lost. It was then explored extensively by Grtinwedel and Le Coq, who brought back many mural paint- ings and manuscripts. Some of the murals can still be seen in the Museum fiir Indische Kiinst in Berlin, see Hartel, H. and M. Yaldiz, Die Seidenstrasse: Malerein undPlastiken aus Buddhistischen Hohlentempels, Staatlische Museen Preussis- cher Kulturbesitz, Berlin, 1987: 42-64, 70-91 (Kyzil fragments). The scene illustrating announcement of the Bud- dha's death to King Ajataiatru (by means of a painting presented by his minister Varsakara) is one of the most famous ones (cf. V. Mair, Painting and Performance, Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis, pl. IV). 3 Compare the descriptions and comments on the ceiling of the cave "der sechzehn Schwerttriger" ("cave with the 16 sword-holders"), now cave 8, and of the southern vault of the "Hillentopfhahle" ("cave with the Hell-cauldron"), now cave 80, with those on the cave "mit dem Musikerchor" ("cave with the Choir of Musicians"), now cave 38, in A. Grtin- wedel, Altbuddhistische Kultstatten in Chinesisch-Turkistan, Georg Reimer, Berlin, 1912: 53-57, 95-97, 65-75. E. Wald- schmidt extended study of the Previous Lives scenes to caves 17, 178, 114, as well as to caves with mixed ceilings no. 8, 80, 198-199, and 206 (A. Lecoq and E. Waldschmidt, Die buddhistische Spatantike in Mittelasien, Berlin, 1922-23, 7 vol., vol. 6: 9-24, 42-62). See also Yaldiz's synthesis, M.

Maisonneuve, Paris, 1983: 279-280. See also the more exhaustive table given in Su Bai, vol. 3: 21o-212. 4 The Chinese archaeologists Ding Mingyi and Ma Shichang have listed 62 episodes for all the caves on the Life of the Buddha, starting from the Prediction of Dipamkara and ending with the Distribution of the relics. Cf. "Kezi'er shiku de fozhuan bihua" (Paintings illustrating the Life of the Buddha in the Kyzil Caves) in Su Bai...: vol. I: 218-219. See also Yaldiz: 79-87 ("Die Buddha Legende"). 306</page><page sequence="3">Because of its strategic situation on commercial highways which linked India and the Western world with the Chinese empire, Kutcha, situated midway between Turfan and Kashgar, was overrun militarily several times by the Chinese between the Ist century A.D. (a raid by General Ban Chao in 88) and the 7th century, when the Chinese protectorate of Anxi (anxi duhufu) moved into Kutchan terri- tory (658).6 In 383, General Lii Guang abducted the Kutchan Kum rajiva (35o-4o9), who became one of the greatest translators of Chinese Buddhist scriptures.7 Kutcha was then an important religious and cultural center and remained one until the 7th century, attracting Indian missionaries as well as Chinese pilgrims, including the most famous, Xuanzang (6o2-664). Its contribution in diffusing Buddhism towards the East was essential." In 698 and again in 791, Tibetan invasions followed the Chi- nese domination. Subsequently, Islam completed the ruin of Kutcha, which was mentioned for the last time in the Chinese History (Songshi) in Io96. With its 236 caves, Kyzil is the largest Kutchan Buddhist sanctuary known today. From its painted art itself, it ranks higher than its neighbors (Kyzil-Gaha, Kumtura, Kirich) (fig. I). As far as its' own chronology is concerned, scholars agree in dating the decadence of Kyzil around the middle of the 7th century, corresponding to the entry of the Chinese protectorate of Anxi into Kutcha. Patronage of the Kyzil caves by the kings of Kutcha has lately been ascertained for Suvarnapuspa (reigned 618-624), thanks to identification of his portrait as a donor in cave 69.9 However, the early chronology of the 5 This historical reconstitution is essentially based on the Chinese historical records (from Hanshu to Songshi) and also, on the Koutchan texts, cf. E. Chavannes, "Chinese Documents" translated in A. Stein "Ancient Khotan": 544 (on the campaign of Lii Guang) ; "Trois generaux chinois," T'oung pao, 1905: 216-245 (on the conquest led by Ban Chao); S. Levi, "Le tokharien B, langue de Koutcha," journal Asiatique, srie XI-II (Sept-Oct. 1913): 323-80. 6 Payment of many tributes between 224 and 630 by Kutcha to the Chinese empire is mentioned in Chinese historical records. The History ofthe Liang Dynasty reports the visit of an envoy of the king of Kutcha (Niruimozhunasheng), loaded with objects of art, during the second year in the reign of Putong (52o-527), i.e., 521. The Tang History mentions a first diplomatic visit the year Emperor Gaozu (Li Yuan) was enthroned (618). He was himself of central Asian origin (from Chengji, in the region of Longxi, in the west of Gansu). It also mentions a tribute of horses brought to China during the fourth year of the Zhenyuan reign, i.e., 630, to his successor, Taizong (Li Shimin), cf.Jiu tangshu, j. 198: 5303 and S. Levi, (as above): 348, 367. 7 The History oftheJin Dynasty mentions I,ooo stupas and temples, as well as a royal palace so beautiful that General Lii Guang, sent by the lord of the dynasty of the Previous Qin (350-94), felt the need to order a satirical piece of poetry on it (cf. S. Levi, S. [as above]: 334, citing the note on Lii Guang's campaign, reported in the History ofthejin Dynasty). 8 Kutchans seem to have participated in translating the Buddhist scriptures into Chinese from as early as the 3rd cen- tury. For instance, Bo Yan, named as such by the Chinese sources and contemporary of the Wei Emperor Cao (254-26o), may be quoted. His surname indicates that he probably was a member of the royal family of Kutcha. See Chusanzang jiji, j. 2 quoted by Xu Wanyin, "quici shiji" ("Chronology of the Events relating to Kucha"), in Su Bai, vol III: 272. A. Howard also mentions Bo Yuanxin and Bo Faju, assistants of Dhamaraksa, who was a contemporary of the Jin Emperor Wudi (died in 304). They may also have been descendants of the same royal clan. However, I do not believe that their Kutchan identity should imply early dates for the Kyzil caves, as Howard has suggested (A. Howard, "In support of a new Chronology for the Kizil Mural Paintings," Archives of Asian Art, XVIV [1991], p. 81). As for the Indian missionaries, Buddhayafas (Fotuoyeshe, 384-417), who translated in Chinese the Dirghagama (Chang ahan jing) and the monastic rules of the Dharmagupta school (the Sifenlu), and Dharmamitra (Tanmomiduo, 356-442), both coming from Kashmir, may be quoted. The Chinese monks Sengchun and Tanchong came to Kutcha in 379, and Sengjing, leading an expedition of IO men in the year 400. 9 The name and the royal status inscribed in the circular halo surrounding the head of the king, painted with his spouse on the upper western section of the wall now close to the entrance, were deciphered by G. Pinault in 1994 (see the 307</page><page sequence="4">Kyzil caves is still a matter of discussion, varying between the 3rd and 6th centuries. This issue has been addressed in detail by Howard. On grounds of stylistic arguments based essentially on comparison with the early Chinese Dunhuang caves, she believes that Kyzil' s early caves date back to the 4th cen-- tury.1o She thus agrees with views advanced by Chinese archaeologists Su Bai and Huo Xuchu, mainly based on CI4 measurements, the contradictory details of which will be reviewed briefly at the end of this study for the three caves involved., Situated on the Muzart river, halfway between the present towns of Kuche (67 km southeast) and Baicheng (6o km west)I (fig. I), Kyzil's exact position on the Northern commercial road which linked the Chinese Empire with the Indian world is also debated, although it now seems taken for granted that its neighbor, Duldur-aqur, was a very important pass at the beginning of the Chinese Tang dynasty.3's It should be emphasized that the Kyzil caves are much less sinicized than the Kumtura caves located only 2o km east, next to the pass. This gives the Kyzil caves a purer Kutchan style and iden- tity.I4 Apart from the mural fragments, which had been removed by explorers at the beginning of this century, many paintings have been preserved in the roughly 80 worship caves of Kyzil. Fairly exhaus- tive color catalogs have recently been published in China, which are of great help in identifying paint- ings not yet understood in situ. They constitute a useful complement to Western publications, essen- tially based on paintings removed during the first two decades of the century.15 reproduction in Minami, Shinkyo no hekiga [Murals of Xinjiang], Tokyo, 1981, vol. I, where inscriptions on the haloe are still visible). For details on identifying Suvarnapuspa and his two sons Suvarnadeva and Haripuspa, with the kings of Kutcha mentioned in the History of the Tang Dynasty, see Levi: 311-21. The German explorers have also found in the cave "with the red dome" (now classified as no. 67) a list of donors including a queen and six kings including Suvarnapuspa and his son Suvarnadeva. It seems that the names of King Tottika and Queen Swayamprabha were written on panels of the mural paintings taken away from cave 2o5 (formerly called the "cave of Mdya of the second foundation") or from cave 224 (cf. M. Maillard, as in note 3: 114; Huo Xuchu and Wang Jianli: 21). The reign of Tottika probably preceded that of Suvarnapuspa, according to R. Jera-Bezard, "Avant-propos" in Sites divers de la region de Koutcha, epigraphie koutchenne (Mission P. Pelliot, documents conserves au muse Guimet et a* la Bibliotheque Nationale, documents archeologiques VIII): VIII. However, Suvarnapuspa and Suvarnadeva are the only kings of Kucha who have been precisely identified so far in the Chinese history that enabled dating their reigns. IO A. Soper, L. Hambis, and Rowland also tended to defend this opinion. Cf. A. Howard, "In Support of a new Chrono- logy for the Kyzil Mural Paintings," Archives of Asian Art, XLIV (1991): 69, 81, notes 2 to 4. For a brief review of the chronological discussions, see infra "Dating Problems. 11 Cf. Su Bai, "Kezi'er shiku bufen dongku jieduan huafen yu niandai deng wenti de chubu tansuo" (Preliminary Study of the Classification by periods and of the question of the datings of some of the caves in Kyzil) in Su Bai, vol. I: 10-23, and Huo Xuchu and Wang Jianli: 1-30. 12 Kyzil (82u3o' North/4IU47' East) is situated upstream from Kumtura (82u40o' North/4IU43' East) on the Mouzart. The location of Kumtura is incorrect in Maillard (as in note 3): map 4 ("les sites de la region de Kutcha"). 13 Duldur-Aqur has recently been identified as an important pass from which many commercial roads branched off towards the West, cf. Wang Binghua, "Tang anxi zhejueguan guzhi bing youguan wenti yanjiu" ("Concerning the pass Zhejue in the region of Anxi under the Tang"), Xibei shidi 1987/3: 10-19. 14 Chen Shiliang, now in charge of the Research Institute of the Kutchan caves, is also working on this issue of geogra- phy, where he cites and criticizes Stein and Pelliot's views (cf "Qiuci fosi de yanjiu," in Qiucifojiao wenhua lunji, Xin- jiang meishu sheying, Urumqi, 1993: 61-65). 308</page><page sequence="5">The worship caves and their ceilings A third of the Kyzil caves have been identified as worship caves, as opposed to caves destined to med- itation, habitation, religious teaching, or book storing. Some 5I of these 8o caves were dug around a pillar used for circumambulation,6 as in Indian caves. This architectural tradition allows the succes- sion of the antechamber, the main chamber, and the rear cella behind the pillar. Because of erosion, most antechambers have collapsed. Princely donors, bodhisattvas, teaching scenes, as well as other events of the life of the Buddha were painted on sidewalls of the main chambers, which have most suf- fered from the Muslim iconoclasm, because of their low position. The rear cella of the caves and cor- ridors leading to it were most often dedicated to the nirvana of the Buddha. The high position of the main chambers' ceilings has helped preserve them. They were decorated with a large number of scenes painted within lozenge-shaped frames delineated with stylized moun- tain peaks. These painted mountain decors recall the motifs sculpted in clay and painted which often surround the niche dug in the circumambulation pillar, in which a statue of the Buddha was placed. They are typical of Buddhist art in Kutchan excavated shrines. The lozenge scenes painted on the ceil- ing of cave II8 and ceilings of cave 77's corridors, believed to belong to the most ancient caves, are rel- atively large in size and decorated with the prevailing theme of meditation in a natural surrounding with animals.1 They then become more regular and more numerous on the vaulted ceilings of the main chambers of caves with central pillars (the pillar separates the main chamber from the rear cella: it is not in the main chamber). Their content is also more complex. As I have said, two main types of ceil- ings can be distinguished: thejdtaka ceilings, where only the former lives of the Buddha are depicted, and the "mixed ceilings," where a large number of scenes (Go to 78) appear. These are characterized by the pattern of a sitting Buddha placed in the center presiding over a few jataka scenes, generally situated on the bottom row.,' This arrangement apparently resembles the ndtaka copies found in Kyzil 15 The recent series are Duan Wenjie (chief ed.): 3 vol. and Su Bai: 3 vol.

Apart from these 5I caves, the other worship caves have a square plan or were designed to hold a large statue (Ma Shichang: I74-I75). 17 Cave II8, which the Germans called "the cave with the hippocampi," consists of a rectangular cella, wider than it is deep. It is situated at the north of the valley which divides the Kyzil site in two parts, west and east. Less than half of the vault decor remains, the other section having been carried away by Griinwedel at the beginning of the century. It is now kept at the Museum in Berlin (cf. Su Bai: vol. II, pls. Io, 151, 154 and Griinwedel (as in note 3): lo7-1o8 (paint- ing copied after); E. Waldschmidt, Gandhara, Kutscha/Turfan, Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann Verlag, Leipzig, 1925: Taf. 37). For cave 77, see Su Bai, vol. II, pls. 20-22, 150, I51 and Grtinwede 192. 18 This is a general division. One should also mention illustration in caves 69 and 178 of some monastic rules, as in a few scenes, deprived of the central Buddha pattern, placed among a great number of jdtaka scenes. See Yao Shihong: I37-I43: "L'e shu Kezi'erjield gushi hua" (An Insight into the Scenes of Monastic discipline painted in Kyzil). 309</page><page sequence="6">- a sort of narrative designed for public performance, based on the previous lives and feats of the Bud- dha - unfortunately, hardly translated at all.x9 Lozenge scenes with a central Buddha In these numerous scenes, in which the repetitive motif of the Buddha confers a certain monotony, the Buddha is represented seated on a rectangular throne, most often topped by a stylized bodhi tree in full bloom or by a st xpa. He generally sits with legs crossed in meditative position or occasionally with legs down. He wears a monastic robe with his right shoulder uncovered. He is painted slightly off cen- ter, so that more space is left to depict subsidiary figures or animals, generally concentrated on one side of the lozenge. These peripheral elements are alternatively placed on the right or left side of the Buddha. Less than in the Gandharan carved panels, they are the only indications that may permit pre- cise identification of the scene. The presence of the seated Buddha under the tree of awakening no longer automatically indicates a teaching scene or a "friendly" relationship between the Buddha and his faithful disciples. It may also be associated with assaults against the Buddha or with his subduing the heretics - episodes which Foucher identified more readily in panels showing a standing Buddha. o Whereas more than half of the 130 jdtaka scenes represented on the ceiling vaults of the painted caves at Kyzil have been identified and listed cave by cave," fewer than one third of the scenes with a central Buddha has been identified. No complete inventory of these caves or of individual scenes painted on vaults of their main chambers has been undertaken. At best, identification has been pro- posed for part of the scenes in some of these caves. Ma Shichang and Yao Shihong are the first schol- ars, to my knowledge, who have involved themselves in the difficult task of identifying these scenes, whom I shall quote in the footnotes. One may regret, however, that they exclusively refer to the Chi- nese Buddhist scriptures, without mentioning the Indian Art precedents or Kutchan epigraphy pub- lished in Europe.- 19 Discovered in the Kyzil library, altogether with the oldest copies of the Indian theatre known today, fragments of these ndtaka copies show an alternation of prose and verse, and contain scenic indications. Encompassing both music and pantomime, they served as a basis for public performances produced by a single narrator, who altered his voice according to the characters. This form of narrative performance, distracting and changeable to suit the indigenous audience, is the ancestor of the "chantefables" or Chinese "transformation texts". Such play-scripts written in B- Tokharian (or Kuchan language) represent an intermediary step between the Indian prototype and the Chinese bian- wen. Cf. G. Pinault, "Introduction au Tokharien," in Lalies 7 (1989): I9, and V. Mair, Tang Transformation Texts, Har- vard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.), I989. Pinault's summarized translation of the "Great departure" theatri- cal script written in B-Tokharian can be found in Gies and Cohen (eds., as in note I1): cat. 35. The most ancient scripts of Indian drama, based on Buddhism, were also discovered in Kyzil. The sanskrit fragments were studied by H. Liiders, "Bruchstiicke buddhistischer Dramen," in Kleine Sansrittexte I, Georg Reimer, Berlin, 1911, Wiesbaden, I979 reprint: 1-69. 2o Foucher: 479 sq. In addition to the Mara's assault, described infra, other examples of aggression may be cited, such as the second full lozenge scene in the 3rd row of cave I7I's western vault, in which a man brandishes a sword, and also the third scene in the 2nd row on the eastern side, in which a man seems to dump a plate of stones onto the Buddha (cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. I: pls. 183 and 185). 21 Yao Shihong: 122. 22 Ma Shichang has proposed to identify about 30 of about 80 scenes painted on the ceiling of the best preserved cave I7IL This included the jdtaka scenes. He has also proposed identifying isolated scenes painted on the vaulted ceilings in 310</page><page sequence="7">When dealing with scenes of the vaults with a central Buddha, Ma Shichang uses the concept of yinyuan gushi- or 'cause-effect stories.' However, the Chinese word yinyuan has been used to translate the sanskrit words avaddna and nidana, thus referring to either of the 6th or IIth categories of the Buddhist scriptures. The definition of avaddna, which has been used to describe the lozenge scenes with a cen- tral Buddha, is itself unclear, as it may variously be understood as extraordinary feats of the Buddha, metaphors or parables,jatakas or even as predictions. For Leon Feer, who translated a late Sanskrit ver- sion of the AvaddnaSataka into French, an avaddna story mainly implies a cause-and-effect relation- ship between two tales.23 However, there is no formal element suggesting the representation of events by pairs or some sort of causal link between the scenes depicted on the Kyzil cave ceilings. Rather than using the ambiguous concept ofavaddna and trying to guess which tales have been depicted, it might be more relevant to simply attempt to identify the stories or metaphors evoked by the painted scenes themselves. Within this vague conceptual frame ofyinyuan stories, Ma Shichang has nevertheless identified a number of lozenge scenes with a central Buddha as episodes in the life of the awakened Buddha or occasionally as scenes of metaphorical content (piyu). 24 Yao Shihong, a former director of the Research Institute on the Kutchan Caves (in Kyzil), has devoted an original and convincing study of scenes on the ceilings of Kyzil caves which specifically illustrate parables. His study shows these teachings of the Buddha based on parables to occupy an important place on ceilings of the type studied here.25 Yet the interpretation of a single scene may vary completely, depending on whether one expects to dis- cover in it a known episode of the Buddha's life or a parable. Thus I will add my own insights to the presentation of scenes for which prior identification seem founded. Instead of the vague concepts of"cause and effect stories," "Buddha scenes," or "preaching scenes, I will propose three thematical categories - subduing, almsgiving, and parables -, deduced from empirical observation. To conduct this study among the 25 caves decorated with "mixed ceilings,"'6 caves 8, 38, 80, IoI, I63, I75, 2o5, and 224. See Ma Shichang: 198-212, and Yao Shihong, "Jieshao ji zhong kezi'er piyu gushihua" (Presentation of a few Paintings of Parables in the Kyzil Caves): Yao Shihong: 144-157. 23 L. Feer, Avaddna-(ataka, cent lMgendes (bouddhiques) traduites du sanskrit (Annales du Musee Guimet, vol. 18), E. Leroux, Paris, 189i, introduction: IX. Hohogirin, fasc. 1 (1929): 9 agrees with the definition: "nom d'un genre litteraire ou l'acte present d'un personnage est rapporte par comparaison a un episode de son passe," and gives two Chinese translations for the Sanskrit,piyu, "comparison," and chuyao, "shed light," whereas Soothill gives an even broader definition: "para- bles, metaphors, stories, illustrations. 24 Ma Shichang's shuoshi paper (equiv. to M.A., unpublished) concentrated on study of paintings in vaults of the main and back chambers of the caves with a central pillar in Kyzil. He proposed a binary classification for lozenge scenes: those which illustrated jdtaka stories (lingge bensheng) on one hand, and those illustrating "cause - effect stories" on the other. In the midst of this last category, rather vaguely defined, he still identified a few scenes of parables. Cf. Ma Shichang: 179-212. Grtinwedel's concept of"preaching scenes" (as in note 3: 95: "Buddhapredikten") was used by the French scholars S. Gaulier, M. Maillard, and R. Jera-Bezard, Buddhism in Afghanistan and Central Asia (Series Icono- graphy of Religions, section 7, fasc. 14), Brill, Leiden, I976: 8. 25 Yao Shihong: I44-157. 26 25 caves present similar vaulted mixed decor, which is still relatively well preserved. The caves are no. 8, 34, 58, 63, 80, 98, Ioo, 101, O104, 163, 171, 172, 175, 179, 184, 186, 188, 192, 193, 196, 199, 20zo5, 206, 219, 224, agreeing with Ma Shichang's list, from which we have deducted cave no. 38, which is special in that it alternatively presents rows of jdtaka scenes together with scenes depicting the life of the Buddha. It deserves a classification of its own. A close exam- 311</page><page sequence="8">I have chosen the best preserved and complementary scenes of ceilings in caves 34, 80, and I7I, with a particular focus on cave 34, which has been overlooked to date. Formal description of mixed ceilings at caves 34, 8o, and 171 These three gather almost all subjects represented in the "mixed" ceilings: cave 34- (formerly called "the cave with the Meditating Sungod" by the Germans, because the painting at the top of the vault portrays Surya sitting on a chariot27), cave 80 (formerly called "the cave with the Hell cauldron"), and cave I7I1. Cave 34 is situated at the western end of the site close to the "cloister with stairs" (cave 36), identified by the Germans (fig. 2).z8 The scenes depicted in cave 34 are the most lavish and least hier- atic ones, which form a useful complement to those of the better-known caves I7I and 80. The position of peripheral elements varies: in cave 34, from one row to the next (fig. 3-4), whereas the alternation takes place from one section of the vault to the other in cave 8o, or from one scene to the next in cave 171,29 located east of the gorge (fig. 2). Some zz scenes have remained entirely preserved on the eastern section of cave 34, but only 14 scenes on the western section (fig. 4), of which the lower part has collapsed. The erosion has been more severe at the southern extremity of the ceiling in the main chamber than in the two other caves. Close exam- ination of the ceiling shows that the detail of the complexion has been applied only on the two lower rows, at least as far as the preserved eastern section is concerned (fig. 3a).3O It seems that the painting of the scenes was not finished. The decorative motif usually painted on top of the Buddha is lacking, except for two scenes on the eastern section of the vault. In one of them, situated in the middle of the fifth row (starting from the top of the vault), one can see the top of a stf pa, adorned with garlands, onto various parts of which the same monogram has been inscribed (fig. 3a). These inscriptions, written on various parts of the figures or elements of the scenes, may refer to either the colors to be applied or to abbreviations of the painters' names31, which would suggest that decoration of the vaulted ceiling was assumed by a team, with certain painters told to apply this or that color or to figures' complexions.32 Whereas the western side section of the barrel-vault ceiling in cave 80 is almost completely col- lapsed, the eastern side is relatively well preserved. This allows counting 39 scenes with a seated Bud- dha, spread over six rows of six or seven lozenges.33 As for cave 34, the initial number of scenes with a central Buddha may have been 78, if one expects both sides of the vault to have been arranged with a similar alternation of rows of six and seven scenes per row. ination, led in situ, made us add cave 34, which was probably omitted accidentally by Ma Shichang, and cave 88 (cf. Ma Shichang: 199). 27 Grtinwedel (as in note 3): 62 and 33, fig. 67. 28 Griinwedel (as in note 3): 39, fig. 79. 29 The painter has broken this principle only in order not to infringe on the rule of general composition. It consists of setting the secondary figure on the left in the case of the lozenges situated on the extreme right of the row and vice- versa. cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pls. 5 and 8. 30 Cf. Su Bai, vol. I: pls. 78 and 80. 31 This hypothesis is proposed by G. Pinault, after confronting his own observation in situ and photographic documents which I presented to him. 32 Cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pls. 78-81. 33 Cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pls. 53. 31I</page><page sequence="9">In comparison, the vaulted ceiling of cave 171 is the best preserved of the three caves. Exceptions are the last row, which has been cut, and wherever meditating Brahmans, monks, or the SaSa jataka (placed in the center of the row) are depicted, just as on the barrel-vaults of caves 34 and 80.34 Both sides of the vault contain 30 scenes each with a central Buddha, equally spread over five rows, and there is usually a single figure standing on either side of the sitting Buddha. The bodhi tree is repeatedly evoked on top of the halo surrounding the Buddha, and one or two birds are depicted standing on its blossoming flowers. The colors used as backgrounds are about the same in the three caves, but they are richer in caves 34 and 171; only in the latter has the red ochre not faded. 2. SPECIFICATION OF TYPOLOGY Whereas events of the life of the Buddha represented on side-walls include episodes of the youth of Gautama, those depicted in the vaulted ceilings' lozenges seem to concentrate on the later life of the Master after his awakening. The predominant arrangement of the jatakas on the bottom row of the vault suggest a chronological reading from the bottom row up to the top row. But since this arrange- ment is not general, and as long as we do not know exactly the sources that determined this icono- graphical program, a thematic breakdown of scenes is preferable to an attempt to reconstitute a chrono- logical sequence. In fact, as Foucher remarked, the Buddhist scriptures show much divergence in the chronological succession of events in the later biography of the Awakened, to which new legendary episodes have been added. The majority of scenes depicted may be grouped thematically into three categories. The first con- sists of the Buddha's demonstration of superiority over his adversaries, gods, or religious chiefs, whom he converts or subdues, peacefully or violently. The second centers on gifts or almsgiving (ddna in San- skrit) which constitutes one of the six virtues encouraged by Buddhism, illustrated in numerous avaddna stories.35 The third group includes the Buddha's parables, or metaphorical teachings, accord- ing to the category established by Yao Shihong. The superiority of Buddha, subduings and conversions Buddhist literature abounds with picturesque examples illustrating the superiority of its hero over diverse divinities or over competing sectarians. The Kutchan epigraphy suggests that a cult centered on commemorating the Buddha's superiority over the gods was practiced in Kutcha's monasteries. Indeed, Paul Pelliot discovered the fragment of a hymn proclaiming the Buddha's superiority at a com- 34 The asa-jadtaka, in which a pigeon or hare commits suicide in order to warm and feed an ascetic, is one of the most frequently illustrated Previous Lives, both on jataka ceilings and in "mixed" ceilings. The jataka with the hare is depicted approximately at the center of the lower row in the eastern section of ceilings in each of caves 34, 80, and I7I, cf. Su Bai, vol. I: pl. 78, vol. II: pl. 53, vol. III: pl 5. In cave 80, the sacrifice of the snake-king - or gankhapdla-jataka - is represented at the left end of the vault's southern side. The gasa-jdtaka of the pigeon is also unusually painted on the upper row of the vault's northern side (see Lecoq and Waldschmidt (as in note 3), vol. 6: 58, figs. 19o0, where the cave is mistaken, 6o, and zo5; Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 64). 35 Rewards for liberality toward the Buddha or other religious mendicants, as well as punishments for reluctance to give alms pervade through the avaddnaSataka (Feer as quoted above). 313</page><page sequence="10">munication crossroad only I5 km away in Duldur-Aqur. Too fragmentary to be identifiable, this hymn contains a list of gods over which the Buddha had been victorious, among them Mara, followed by the yaksas Atavaka and Surya, as well as the ndga divinities, Upaldla and Bhima.36 A similar fragment of Sanskrit text praising the Buddha as a converter was in the same region. It too mentions the sub- duing of the yaksa Atavaka, the snake-king Apalala, the angry elephant of Rajagrha, and the heretic killer Afigulimala.37 The scenes evoked below may have been related to such proclamations of the Buddha's superiority over the gods. i. The subduing of Mara The first and the most important of the gods over whom the sage of the clan of Sakya was victori- ous was Mara, the god of desire. Several scenes painted on the main walls or on lateral walls of the Kyzil caves illustrate the various assaults of Mara, including the attempted seduction by his daugh- ters.38 The scene can be only schematic in the reduced space of ceiling lozenges: in cave 80, charac- teristic features permit identifying the villain: his green skin and pointed ears, the hair dressed in pigtails gathered on top of his skull. He attacks the Buddha armed with a javelin that he holds with both hands, the right foot raised (fifth scene on the second row; fig. 5).39 In contrast to cave 80, Mara has a halo over his head in cave 171.40 He sits on a throne compa- rable to that of the Buddha, but smaller, and has four arms: the two upper arms seem to want to hit the Buddha with a lance pointed at him, while the lower arms hold a weapon lying on his thighs. In this way, the two moments of aggression and subduing of the god are represented simultane- ously.4I 36 Cf. the Pelliot fragment (find no. 882, provisional list no. 1116) quoted in B. Pauly, "Fragments sanskrits de Haute Asie (Mission Pelliot), no. XII: 'hymne en I'honneur du Bouddha Sakyamuni; texte en prose sur les proclamations de superiorit'," Journal Asiatique, vol. 248 (g196o): 52o-521). Upalala may be an indigenous adaptation of the Indian Apalala, the subduing of whom is said to have occurred late in the Buddha's life (Divyavadidna, quoted in Foucher: figs. 270-275). Other divinities were probably listed next, which might have helped to identify scenes painted on the vaults. 37 Simple descriptions of the subdued are given in these fragments, as that of the fiery hair, trembling tongue, teeth, and eyes like sun of Atavaka; the fire-spitting snake Apalala from Himalaya, the bloody elephant from Rajagrha (likely to be the one sent by Devadatta and Ajatasatru, as mentioned further down, p. 21), and Ahigulimala, "the killer of one thousand people" about to kill his own mother. See D. Schlingloff, Buddhistische Stotras aus ostturkistanischen San- skrittexten, Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1955: lo1-1o5 (fragment G: "Preis der Bekehrungen Buddhas" [Praise of the con- verting-Buddha]). 38 Those in cave Iio are among the most beautiful. This scene depicting Mdira's Assault on the large lunette panel placed right under the vaulted ceiling, was still visible at the beginning of the century, cf. Hambis (as in note I5): fig. 146 (Mission Griinwedel - Le Coq). The rectangular lateral scenes still visible today include Mdara's daughters' attempted seduction and their punishment (cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pl. IIy). Two other examples of Mara's Assault may be quoted, in cave 80 (right wall, cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 51) and probably in cave 92 (very damaged, left of the wall opposite to the entrance). 39 Cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 57. 40 This halo seems to contradict a figure supposed to incarnate evil; it is probably a later deviation, compared with the Mara figure painted on the vault in cave 80. In cave 34, in a scene of which only the upper part remains, there is a blue figure drawing an arch. A human head is painted below it. If this relates to Mdira's Assault, the absence of a halo is justified. 314</page><page sequence="11">The subduing of two divinities belonging to the yaksas category is also illustrated amid scenes with a seated Buddha. They concern the Subduing of the Ogre-of-the-Waste-land, situated next to the previous one, in cave 171 (extreme left of the fourth row in the eastern section), and that of his fel- low creature, Hariti, the mother-of-demons, depicted in more worldly features (cave I71's eastern section vault, in the fourth scene of the second row),42 and also depicted in caves 34 and 80. Xuan- zang reports that he had visited commemorative monuments of the subduings of both of these two yakdsa gods43, to whom a common ritual offering of food, in exchange of abandoning their reputed cannibalism was perpetuated in Buddhist monasteries.44 Thanks to her function as a child giver and the exoticism of her legend,45 Hariti was nevertheless to acquire a higher reputation in China than that ofAtakava, who was to become the General-of-the-Waste-land.46 2. The subduing of the ogre Atavaka Depicted with a naked chest and covered with a simple loincloth like Indians of low caste, the ogre presents a young infant to the Buddha who holds it in both hands, his left knee on the ground. A halo emphasizes his status as a god (fig. 6). The similarity to the Gandhtran reliefs47 suggests the identification of Atavaka48, who is specifically named on the indigenous list proclaiming the superiority of the Buddha mentioned above.49 41 This Mara figure may be compared with its equivalent in the scene situated at the extreme left of the upper row on the western side of cave 224's vault. In it the villain, with a green skin, also has four arms. Both pairs of arms are busy attacking the Buddha, the two upper arms threatening to dump a plate of stones from above (cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 142). This last point makes me question the scene painted in the second row of cave I7I's eastern side. A young man, depicted in short dress in it, threatens the Buddha in the same fashion - with a plate of stones. I question if this is not a continuation of Mdra's Assault scene, rather than Devadatta's Assault, as believed by Ma Shichang: 2o3. 42 Cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 5. 43 Sacrifices were still being carried out in the 7th century at the stupa that commemorated the conversion ofHariti, sit- uated in the Gandhara, somewhere between Pkalavati and Varoucha. The text is not clear as to the precise location of the stupa, which is specified only by the distance of "co li to the northwest of the strpas of Brahma and Indra." Cf. S. Julien, Memoires sur les contres occidentales, vol. I: 119-I22. 44 Xuanzang claims to have seen a stupa more than 30 li east of the temple of the god Narayana, located north of the Ganges. It was preceded by a column inscribed with a text commemorating the Submission of the demon(s) of the Waste- land by the Buddha (cf. Foguang dacidian: 6666 and S. Julien, Memoires de Hiouen-thsang, vol. I: 381). 45 See E. Lesbre, "jiebotu juan yanjiu," Meishu yanjiu I996/4: 24-29, and Meishu yanjiu 1997/1: 85-92; E. Lesbre, "La con- version de Hariti au Buddha: origine du theme iconographique et interpretations picturales chinoises," Arts Asia- tiques 55 (2000): 98, 114 note 4, and J. Murray, "Representations of Hdriti, the Mother of Demons, and the Theme of 'Raising the Alms-bowl' in Chinese Painting," Artibus Asiae, vol. XLIII, no. 4. (1981-1982): 253-84. 46 Atakava, whose name in Sanskrit means the demon of the jungle, will become the General-of-the-Wastelands (kuangye dajiang) in China, associated in particular with the Fast of Water and Earth (shuilu zhai), (cf. C. Gyss-Vermande, "Demons et Merveilles: vision de la nature dans une peinture liturgique du XVe siecle," Arts Asiatiques, vol. XLIII (1988): III). 47 Cf. Foucher: 507, 511, figs. 252-253. 48 Cf. Ma Shichang: 204, fig. IO8. 49 Ma Shichang identifies the same episode in the scene at the extreme right in the upper row on the western wall in cave 14: a man with a black skin, very hairy, and bearded, dressed in a short loincloth of the low castes, holds an infant by the hand (cf. Su Bai, vol. I: pl. 44)- 315</page><page sequence="12">The moment represented is the surrender of the ogre, who hands over to the Buddha the infant he was about to devour. Different tales depict the child as either the son of a king or of a rich mer- chant. They describe subduings, which are more or less peaceful or provoked by the menace of Vajrapatni.5o 3. The subduing of Hariti The yaksini Hdriti, better known in China as the mother-of-demons, is represented kneeling down or seated,5' facing the Buddha, whom she appears to implore with her hands joined in the ar-jali gesture. Her curly hair is ruffled, a sign of her despair after the disappearance of her youngest son, who has been captured and hidden in Buddha's alms bowl, in order to force her to renounce her child-devouring activities (fig. 7).52 A halo indicates her role of goddess, venerated for fertility, like the yaksas of pre-Buddhist India. Her last son appears in profile as prisoner in the Buddha's alms bowl, placed in front of the latter's throne. Only his head, shoulders, and joined hands emerge from the bowl. Finally, scenes of conversion of the gods who belong to the ndgas and gandharvas category are also illustrated on mixed type ceilings. Ndga divinities are recognized by the characteristic hood of a many-headed cobra, which surmounts either the body of a snake or that of an anthropomorphic o50 For a translation into French of the episode, see the second part of the story "of the big strong man who converted the gang of bandits in the desert region," extracted from the Za baozangjing (T. 2o3, IV (8): 97-98 (section 97)), - in which the child receives the name of "(the survivor) from the hands (of the ogre) of the Waste lands" (kuangye shou), cf. E. Chavannes, Cinq cent Contes et Apologues, vol. III: 96-98. The story of the vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadin is very close to the previous one and gives the Sanskrit name of the child as Hastaka (cf. the summary of the Tibetan transla- tion in Panglung: 153-154). A violent intervention of the vajrapani occurs in the story of the Guanfo sanmei dhaijing, and the ogre is confused with Samjfieya (sanzhi). See the synthesis of the various Indian and Chinese incidents by R. Duquesne, 'Daigensui', Hibogirin, 6th fascicule, 1983, p. 617. Note that the story also appears in the Chinese trans- lation of the northern version of the Dhammapada - the illustrated Uddnavarga, or Uddndlankara. The child taken away by the yaksa (aluopo) in it is the very beautiful son of a very rich man from Atavi (aluopi) (cf. Ed. Huber, biblio- graphical notice on A. Foucher, "Les bas-reliefs du stipa de Sikri," B.E.F.E.O., 1904, p. 461, and the Chuyao jing, T. 212, IV (12): 672b - 673b). 5I In caves 34 (right end of the third row in the vault's eastern section) and 171 (fourth scene in the second row of the east- ern section), she has her left knee on the ground and figures to the left of the Buddha, while she is seated on the right in cave 80 (extreme left of fifth row, southern section). 52 The story is narrated in the following Chinese Buddhist scriptures: the Za baozang jing, T zo3, IV (9), 492a-b, sup- posedly a translation from an unidentified Indian text by Tanyao in 472; and the Genbenshuo yiqieyoubu pinaiye zashi (Miscellany of the vinaya of the Mulasarvdstivddin), T. 1451, XXIV (31): 36oc-362c, a Chinese translation by Yi Jing in 695, and of which there is a Tibetan equivalent (cf. Panglung: 196). The latter version is the most detailed and gives the goddess 500oo children, whereas the Za baozang jing attributes Io,ooo to her (cf. complete translation in Peri, "La mere-de-demons," B.E.F.E.O., 1917: 2-15, and English summaries in Murray [as in note 45]: 253 sq.). This story is also summarized in the Life of the Buddha written in verse by Baoyun in the 5th century, T. 193, IV (4): 82 and in the Lian- huamian jing (Sutra of the Face ofthe Lotus), translated by Narendrayasas in 585, T. 386, XII: 1076-7. For a synthesis of the various stories, see E. Lesbre, La conversion de Hdritt, Mere des dimons, dans l'iconographie chinoise, Ph. D. disserta- tion (unpublished, INALCO, 99): 37-5o and "La conversion [...]" (as in note 45), Arts Asiatiques 55 (200ooo): 98,114 note 4, where the scene illustrating Hdritl's submission in the Kyzil caves is also discussed (fig. I). 316</page><page sequence="13">figure of noble role, s53 as in the art of Gandhara. A round halo reminds the viewer of their divin- ity. 4. The subduing of the ndga The scene in which the Buddha is entwined in snake rings and surmounted by a canopy made of snake-heads evokes the conversion of the first ndga-king, Mucilinda, who protected the Buddha against the cold just after the breaking of his fast (cave 80, third row, fifth scene; fig. 8).54 Considering that their names are mentioned in the indigenous fragment of The hymn ofprocla- mations of superiority discovered by Pelliot, it is likely that the ndgas Upalala and Bhima are repre- sented in other scenes depicting snakes surging out of the waters or showing an anthropomorphic na-ga figure making the a-jali greeting. Nevertheless, in the absence of more precise indigenous textual evidence, it is difficult to relate these succinct representations to particular legends. 5. The harp contest won at the expense of the Gandharva king (Supriya) The subduing of the vain Gandharva king who believed that his musical talent was unsurpassable is seldom illustrated. His identification, proposed by Ma Shichang for cave I71's vault depicting the second scene in the fourth row of the western section,55 is better documented for the scene sketched aside (fig. 9)56 and situated on cave 196's eastern section ceiling in the fourth row. It portrays a man with a bare chest, dressed in a long loincloth, a halo over his head and holding a harp in his left hand, while another harp is laid on the floor in front of the Buddha. It is likely that the god holding a harp in a scene of the second row at the eastern ceiling sec- tion of cave 34 refers to the same event (fig. 9). The tale, which is illustrated, seemingly constitutes an original extension of the 'Visit of Indra' episode. It is usually identifiable on the Gandharan reliefs, by the gandharva, holding a harp, placed in front of Sakyamuni.57 This gandharva-king - named Supriya in the Avaddnaiataka and in the Tibetan translation of the vinaya of the Milasarvdstivddin, or Shan'ai in the Chinese translationS - had seen the major events of the life of Sakyamuni, as he was Indra's assistant, without converting. In order to lead this god of music to conversion, the Buddha, disguised as a gandharva, challenges him to a com- 53 They are usually painted bare-chested, wearing a necklace, and dressed in trousers. 54 Cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 57. 55 The gandharva wears a necklace in cave 171. His halo has been scraped, and his right arm is raised, probably in a sign of admiration. Cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. I: 174, pl. 188. 56 Cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 94 (middle scene in the eastern section's fourth row). 57 See A. Foucher: 492, figs. 246-247. For a detailed reproduction of the scene in cave 196, cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. 2: pl. 62, in which a specific hairstyle characteristic of the gandharva is visible. His hair is tied up in four pigtails on top of the skull. 58 Cf. Panglung: zoo, the Chinese translation of Miscellany of the Vinaya of the Mflasarvastivddin, already cited, T. 1451, XXIV (37): 395b-396c, and Feer, Avddana-(ataka: 76-79, although the story is given there as one part of ajdtaka tale and has an unclear ending. In the Divyavaddna, cited by Foucher, the gandharva who accompanied Indra was called Pancasikha, but there is no question of his submission (Foucher: 492). The story of Supriya is also told. 317</page><page sequence="14">petition on the harp, in which he is superior in every exercise, in spite of the strings being gradu- ally removed from the instrument. Even without strings, the harp of the Buddha produces a mar- velous melody, which overcomes the pride of the musician king.59 The gilded legend of the Buddha shows him victorious, not only over the gods but also over his various spiritual competitors, usually referred to as the "heretics" or "preachers of false doc- trines" (tirthika). There are also numerous scenes illustrating the subduing of heretics on side-walls of the worship-caves.60 The Brahmanic cord they wear across the chest helps to identify them as "heretics," but this identification cannot always be specified.'61 Five such scenes follow here. The first is a miracle performed by the Buddha which may be interpreted as a particular demonstra- tion of his superiority over the heretics - variously described, according to the different sources, as Nirgrantha jil-taputra or the group of Six Preachers of False Doctrines he belongs to, or, yet, as mere 'Brahmans.'6z 6. Jyotiska resuscitated from the fire At the middle of the third row in cave 34's eastern section vault, a kneeling man wearing a turban presents a child with his hands to the Buddha, while the lying body ofa woman is surrounded by flames (fig. Io). I believe this scene evokes the spectacular confirmation ofa prediction formulated by the Bud- dha, concerning the gender of an heir long hoped for by a devotee of the Buddha's competitors. The Six Preachers of False Doctrines had predicted to that man ofJambu the birth of a girl. Downcast, the future father followed the advice of a friend and put the question again to the Bud- dha, who, in turn, promised him a son. The Six Preachers of False Doctrines, driven by jealousy and by the fear that their prediction would turn out to be wrong when the mother would deliver the child, offered her a poisoned fruit, and she died.63 The Buddha intervened in order to reverse 59 Ma Shichang mentions the presence of a comparable scene painted on the lateral walls in the left gangway of the cir- cumambulation in several caves, including 80, which I have not been able to verify (cf. Su Bai, vol. I: 2o7, episode 53 of the table). 60 As in cave 80, in the lunette under the barrel vault facing the entrance (in the place of the clay-relief Sumeru moun- tain, cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. II: pl. 161). The scene is also presented on the right wall of caves 14 and zo7 (cf. Su Bai, vol. I: pl. 43). 61 See, for example, scenes placed on the left of the upper row in the eastern section and in the middle of the upper row in the western section of cave 34's vault (figs. I and 2). 62 In the Divydvaddna and the Tibetan translation of the Vinaya of the Mdlasarvastivddin, the father is identified as Sub- hadra, a disciple of Nirgrantha-jfiatiputra who has been assimilated to the Jain patriarch contemporaneous to Sakya- muni, while his son is called Jyotiska, 'the fiery' (A: Foucher: 527, Panglung: 168-169). The Chinese compilation from which I inferred this identification - an early Ming edition of the Shishi yuanliu yinghua shiji (Events and Conversions of the Buddha) (1425, Beijing Library, Zheng Zhenduo fund, cat. Xiti shumu 10336) speaks of the "brahmans" (bolu- omen). The episode narrated in this popular Life of the Buddha is based on a previous Chinese compilation, thejinglu" yixiang, where we find in the 45th chapter a corresponding story, itself derived from a Chinese translation of the Mahd parinirvdna sutra, the Daban niepan jing, T. 375, XII (28): 788b-89a. The Chinese illustrators have the merit of repre- senting the mother also resuscitated (see, for example, the painting of the Jueyuansi, in eastern Sichuan, Mu Xueyong, Jiange jueyuansi mingdaifozhuan bihua, p. 143, episode II2z, and E. Lesbre, "Une ancienne vie illustree du Buddha datant de I425 (Shishi yuanliu yinghua shiji), et sa fonction de module, illustrie par les peintures murales du Jueyuan si, au Sichuan oriental," Arts Asiatiques no. 57 (to be published). 318</page><page sequence="15">the mistaken views of the father, when the dead woman was on the stake, and the incineration had already started. He sent his disciple, the doctor Jivaka to extract the child from the mother's belly. The child came out alive and proved the Buddha to be right, since it was a boy. His father repented having worshipped the Six Preachers of False Doctrines and became converted to the Buddha.64 7. The false pregnancy unmasked The denunciation of a feigned pregnancy involving an adept of the tirthikas - (named Cifica Manavika in the Indian and Tibetan sources) is another miracle (pratihdrya) by which the Buddha, falsely accused by that woman to have had sexual intercourse with her, denounces and subdues his libellous rivals.65 Cave 80 shows the most explicit illustration, apparently without a Gandharan antecedent. A woman dressed as a Kutchan is sitting on the left of the Buddha, her right hand laid on her belly, from which is slipping a big wooden bowl. A white mouse, known to be an ephemeral incarnation ofIndra, flees after having chewed the bonds that kept the false belly in place (fig. 11).66 8. Conversion of the butcher A third episode in which the Buddha undoes his adversaries' accusations is probably identifiable in a cave 34 scene at the second row of the western section's vault. A young monk kneels with joined hands to the left of the Buddha. A butcher's knife lies aban- doned on the ground in front of a lying cow that also seems to be listening to the Buddha's teach- ing. An animal hide is depicted over the young man (fig. 12). I believe this should indicate a butcher who has given up his profession. According to the Chinese translation of the Uddnavarga, the Bud- dha pronounced some shrewd verses, showing that he had foreseen that the heretics planned to slander him. This prompted their acknowledgement of the Buddha's superiority over themselves.67 9. The subduing of rtgupta, the poisoner The heretic shown to be pouring food into the Buddha's bowl (middle of third row at the south- ern section of cave 8o's vault) seems to evoke the subduing of Srigupta, who intended to poison him with food. The story relates that the Buddha and his disciples could eat the food without being hurt, thanks to a miracle of Sakyamuni. Amazed at this extraordinary feat, Srigupta repented. Some sources present him as the brother-in-law ofJyotiska, mentioned above.68 His features are 63 This is the version of the Chinese translation of the Mahaparinirvdna szatra, in which the mother's poisoning is attrib- uted to the Heretic Masters. It seems more probable than that of the Divydvaddna, which blames the husband. 64 The scene has antecedents in the art ofGandhara. Cf. Foucher: 527-528, figs. 258-260. 65 See the summary in the Tibetan translation of the episode incorporated in the Vinaya of the Mulasarvdstivddin, Pan- glung: 5o; and the French translation according to the Dhammapada of Feer, injournal Asiatique, series 9, vol. IX, (1897): 288-317. 66 Cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. II: pl. 17I, on the fourth scene of the fifth row. 67 This episode is related in the Faju piyujing: T. 211, IV (3): 590-591 (section 19: "calomny"), and it can be traced in the compilation already cited, Shishi yuanliu yinghua shiji (Events and Conversions of the Buddha, episode 120o). 68 The episode is narrated first in the scriptures related to the Malasarvastivadin school, that is the Genben shuoyiqieyou bu nituonamudejia: T. I452, XXIV (8): 444b-445b - where the failure of Srigupta's attempt to make the Buddha fall in 319</page><page sequence="16">typically those of the heretics depicted at Kyzil: a Brahmanic cord across a bare chest, the hips cov- ered with a loincloth falling to his knees, bearded, the hair dressed in a chignon (fig. 13).69 IO. The conversion of the Kdayapa brothers Finally, the conversion of the Kasyapa brothers from Uruvilva, fire-worshippers with their hair tied in a chignon (jatila), seems to be evoked in the scene represented at the extreme right of the second row within the same decor in cave 80. a) A serpent entwines itself around the Buddha, and seems ready to spit its venom, while a man, dressed as Srigupta, stands to the left of the Buddha, holding a jug of water in his left hand with his right hand raised to the sky (fig. 14a). The scene evokes the subduing of a venomous serpent at the temple of the Ka-yapa broth- ers. The painted scene from vaults in the Kyzil caves slightly differs from the Gandharan reliefs, as the snake directly entwines the Buddha instead of standing upright next to him.70 b) The scene at the fifth row of cave 34's eastern section vault (below Ha-riti) may be another evo- cation of the same event. It shows a man with a chignon and a beard. He is dressed as a heretic in the act of dropping some objects into an expanse of water (fig. I4b). I believe it may refer to the final abandonment by the Ka-yapa brothers (or their nephew Upasena) of their objects of worship, which they eventually threw into a river. From a formal point of view, the scenes above illustrate in a synthetic manner the Buddha's man- ifestations of superiority over the gods and heretics, depicting either of two moments: they repre- sent the figure or divinity at the expense of whom the demonstration is made, either in the act of aggression or in the following moment of being subdued, symbolized by the kneeling or sitting position. It is likely that other acts of aggression depicted on the same category of ceilings evoke other feats of Buddha comparable to those presented above. Their identification is still awaited or uncertain.7I a fire pit is narrated first: lotus flowers suddenly bloomed up to let him walk on them. Srigupta became ashamed and released his wife (Jyotiska's younger sister) who begged the Buddha to forgive him. Srigupta is said to have eaten him- self part of the poisoned food without being hurt either. The story is also narrated in the presumed Chinese transla- tion of the vinaya of the Sarvastivadin school - a translation to which Kumarajiva has contributed, the Shisong l, T. 1435, XXIII (61): 464-465. This story may be compared to those narrating the punishment of a man and a woman who have respectively poured urine and excrement instead of food into the bowls of religious mendicants. Because of their evil deed, they were reborn into pretas (Feer, Avaddna-?ataka, nos. 41 and 44: 162-166 and 171-174). 69 The scene in cave 8, reproduced in Su Bai, vol. II: pls. 53 and 57, may be compared with the middle scene in the sec- ond row of the western section in cave 34. The heretic, seated on a stool in cave 34, also appears to offer food to the Buddha. 70 The scene reproduced in Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 53 or the even more explicit variation, in which a ndga comes out of a green lake, in the second row of cave 196's eastern section (Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 95) may be compared to Foucher: 449, fig. 224. 71 Men are seen threatening the Buddha with a sword or a plate of stones in scenes located in the middle of the second and third rows in the eastern section of cave I71's vault. The absence of complementary elements and related epigraphic documents does not allow precise identification. 320</page><page sequence="17">i I; fi IJ .).ei ",!+ I .................

Numerous scenes represent figures making the gesture of giving an object to the Buddha. This object may be a bowl, a cloth, a bunch of flowers, a scintillating object, an oil lamp, sometimes even a religious monument. I. Buddha receives the alms bowl from the Four Kings The first offering, which Buddha received on emerging from his six-year fast, was the precious bowl brought by the Four Celestial Kings. It permitted him to receive alms of food like any begging monk. At the extreme right of the second row in cave I71's vaulted eastern ceiling (fig. 15), one sees the personification of the four kings, who are beautifully painted, each carrying his bowl, on the larger scene of the right wall of cave IIo.71 Dressed as a military chief, kneeling with a halo over his head, this character presents a blue bowl to the Buddha.73 Comparing this to its Gandharan antecedents, the clothing has been adapted to local indige- nous taste.74 2. Offering food The food offering by merchants who become the first updsakas - or lay devotees - may be repre- sented to the right in the fourth row of cave 34's eastern section vault. Here a bare-chested man seems to take something from the load borne by two lying cows (fig. 16). I believe the moment alluded to might be the Buddha's teaching delivered to the merchants before their handing over of alms, since Buddha is not shown offering his bowl. 3. Pirna's alms In the second scene of cave I7I's upper row in the eastern section, the Buddha is shown receiving a bowl from another man. The absence of a halo indicates that he is a human, not a god. His clothes, soberer than those of the Celestial King, seem to suggest that he is the son of a noble family: bare- chested, he wears a long blue loincloth, a turban over his hair, and a round necklace. Ma Shichang recognizes Purna's offering of food for the Buddha's bowl.75 This gift was rewarded a hundredfold by an infinite harvest of cereals transformed into gold, which would grow again after being cut. The king saw this miracle, as did Purna's brothers, who could not believe that their poor brother had suddenly become so rich. Consequently they too convert to the Buddha. This reward of golden cereals concerns both the act ofalmsgiving, which is symbolized significantly here, and implicit 72 Cf. Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 116 and vol. III: pl. 5, and Ma Shichang: zoo, fig. 198. A fragment of the same scene was also painted in the shrine of Duldur-Aqur, see Gies and Cohen (eds., as in note I5): cat. I92. 73 According to E. Huber, this episode is indeed located under the Tree of Awakening in the already cited Chinese trans- lation of the northern version of the Dhammapada, the Chuyao jing (T. 212, IV (12)), contrary to Mahdavastu tradition (cf. Huber, B.E.F.E.O., I904: 462). 74 Cf. for instance, the relief of Sikri, in Foucher: 417, fig. 2Io. 75 Ma Shichang: 2oz, no. 2, where the section of the vault indicated has been mistaken for the left one, when it ought to be the right one. 333</page><page sequence="30">recognition of the Buddha's superiority over the Brahmanic system to which P1rna belonged orig- inally.76 4. The episode of the monkey who spontaneously offers a bowl offresh palm sap to the Buddha is illus- trated in the same vault's first scene in the fourth row of the section.77 As a reward, he was prom- ised a privileged rebirth. 5. The gift ofthefirst monastery to the Buddha's increasingly numerous community of disciples by the rich man of Sravasti, Sudatta Anathapindada, is probably evoked in a scene showing an architec- tural element. Numerous gifts of monasteries or stupas and their rewards are described in the Bud- dhist scriptures. And the ceiling of cave 171 presents three scenes with a piece of such architecture.78 One must admit that it is impossible to tell precisely from the sole painting which event they depict. 6. Mahaprajapati gautami's gift of a precious cloth The offering of a precious cloth by the Buddha's step-mother, Mahapraj'apati, appears to be well identifiable in a scene located in cave 34's vault in the fourth row of the eastern section: a well- dressed kneeling woman presents a folded cloth, placed on a tray which she carries on her head (fig. 17). Mahaprajapati is presented by some scriptures as having offered the Buddha and his dis- ciples (or community?) two monastic coats, woven by herself, as she was requesting permission to become a nun. This scene thus indirectly refers to the difficulties in founding the female Buddhist order, acceptance of which was supposed to imply the fall of Buddhist Law much earlier than previously planned.79 76 According to the Chinese scripture T. 2o3, IV (49): 469-470, Purna's (translitteratedfuna) alms consisted of rice. His four brothers follow his example by each offering a rejoicing pill to the Buddha, while making the wish to be reborn among the devas. Like Purna, they reach the state of andgamin, enter into religion, and reach the saintliness of the arhat. According to the Sanskrit version of the AvaddnaSataka translated by Feer, Purna poured all sorts of solid and liquid food into the Buddha's alms-bowl, who in turn poured it into the bowls of the I,ooo bhiksus. Buddha's bowl nevertheless remained full (Feer, Avaddna-(ataka no. I: 25). The Chinese translation is more detailed: Purna is pre- sented as a rich brahman, rather than a poor peasant, who first hears of the Buddha through a friend coming from Ra-ja- grha. The incense Purna burns from the top of a high building to invite the Buddha is said not only to remain sus- pended as clouds on top of the Buddha's head but also to have perfumed the whole city (T. 2oo, IV: 2zo3). 77 Cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 8, Ma Shichang: 2ol, fig. 94, and Foucher: 513, fig. 254 (stupa of Sikri). 78 In the next to last scene on the right in the third row of the western section, a monk is shown kneeling on the right of the Buddha, his hands joined, while a rectangular meditation cell is painted on the left. Ma Shichang also identifies a monastic cell in the pointed triangular object represented behind the monk depicted in another scene at the right end of the upper row. Finally, on the extreme right of the third row in the eastern section, a man, dressed in a mer- chant's blue coat, kneels and holds a cloth in his hands. It may be understood as a gesture of donation, while a stupa with several levels is represented behind him (cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. II: pl. 193). 79 The gift of two garments she has woven is mentioned in T. 1421, XXIV (29): I85b, presumably the Chinese transla- tion of the Mahisdkavinaya, by the Cashmeree Buddhajiva (423). The shortening of the Buddhist Law because the Bud- dha accepted foundation of the nuns' order is explicitly mentioned in numerous texts, such as T. 26, I (28): 605c, 334</page><page sequence="31">7. The offering of flowers The offering of flowers to the Buddha appears in numerous stories and is often described as being rewarded by some miraculous event. A man dressed in a loincloth and a scarf, a turban on his head, stands up and offers a bunch of flowers to the Buddha with his right hand (fig. 18). Is he the gar- den-keeper of the Jetavana in Sravasti who offered himself the lotus which both Anathapindada and a disciple of the tirthikas wanted to buy from him in view of offering it to their competing religious masters? Or does he represent the inhabitants of Rajagrha who, at the sight of the Bud- dha, decided to offer him flowers originally destined for their tyrannical king, despite the death penalty they would receive for doing so?8o In the case of the dramatic ending of the latter story and the offering made by the old woman beggar Nanda described below, the tale ends with the Buddha's prophecy (vydkarana) promising to realize the wish (pranidhadna) for a future life formulated by these figures. A comparison of these scenes may therefore be drawn with other "scenes of wishes" identified in Kutchan paintings.81 8. The scintillating object, presented by another man, kneeling (dressed in a long blue loincloth and wearing a knotted turban while crowned with a halo) has been interpreted as theprecious stone being offered by the Brahman jeweler (fourth scene of cave I7I's upper row of the western section).82 In cave 80 we probably have the same Brahman dressed as a Kutchan merchant (scene at the extreme right of the fifth row).83 9. The symbolic alms of dust I believe the offering of dust (Pdnsu-pradana) by a young child is illustrated in the last scene, half preserved in the fourth row of cave 34's western section vault (fig. I9). The Buddha condescends to present his bowl to the child to receive his symbolic alms. He informs him of a prophecy (vydkarana): T 196, IV: 158a-b, the Bhiksunivinaya of the Mahasamghika-lokottaravadin school (transl. in French from Sanskrit by E. Nolot, Regles de discipline des nonnes bouddhistes, Baccard, Paris, 1991: 2-9). 80 See the last scene on the extreme right of the upper row in cave 34's western section and the central scene in the upper row of cave I71's eastern section, where the man kneels and wears a narrow piece of cloth across his bare chest (the brah- man's cord). The Sanskrit AvaddnaSataka includes a few stories involving floral offerings. In case of the lotus flower Anathapindada and a tirthikas adept both wanted to buy from the gardener, the tale says that after the gardener had thrown the lotus onto the Buddha, it became as big as the wheel of a chariot and remained suspended on top of Bud- dha's head ("padma avadana," no. 7, Feer: 41-43). In the "Nirmala" story, the mimosa sent to the Buddha by another gardener immediately grows as a tree when falling to the ground (no. 29, Feer: 1o8--o9). Neither of these extraodi- nary feats has been depicted in the lozenge, which may indicate that the last interpretation, proposed by Ma Shichang: 199 for cave 171, is more suitable: the story of inhabitants of Rajagrha is described in the presumed Chinese transla- tion of the AvaddnaSataka, (Zhuanji baiyuan jing, T. zoo, IV (6): 229 (53rd section), but it does not appear in the late sanskrit text translated by Feer. 81 Cf. the exhibition catalog Serinde, Terre de Bouddha, Paris, R.M.N, 1995:145, pl. 65 (a fragment now kept in the Her- mitage Museum, St Petersburg, which was brought from Kyzil's "cave of the demons" (i.e. cave 198) by Berezovski in 1905. 82 This identification is suggested by Ma Shichang. The episode is described in the already cited Za baozangjing, T. zo3, IV (7), 79th section: 480c-48Ia. Note that the first scene of the same row is formally very close. 83 Cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. II: pl. 173. 335</page><page sequence="32">that he will be born again to become a king (Aloka). This famous story, which was illustrated on the Gandharan panels,84 also inspired a beautiful and larger painting on the side-walls of the nearby sanctuary at Kumtura.s85 IO. The old beggar's alms of lamp oil Finally, the lit oil lamp that a kneeling woman presents to the Buddha with both hands (cave I7I's western section at the right end of the fifth row). It probably illustrates the exemplary devotion of the old beggar Nanda, who did not hesitate to give all she had collected in her quest, in order to buy the oil destined to feed one lamp in the Buddha's vihdra. The sincerity of her faith makes the lamp shine throughout the night, while the Buddha replies with a prophecy that answers her wish to be born again in a better condition in order to free her fellow beings from evil.86 Ii. Avaricious Todeya reborn as a dog The second scene, with a white dog lying on a square stone next to a recipient, depicted on cave 80's ceiling in the fourth row of the southern section (fig. 21), seems to illustrate the reward (or punishment) for lack of liberality. By depicting a bad fate - that is, reincarnation, here, in the ani- mal phase - deserved by one who refuses to give alms, this scene may be interpreted as an indirect enticement to almsgiving. A housemaster stands to the left of the Buddha, his hands resting on a sword. This gesture is probably an allusion to the aggressiveness of Subha manava Todeyaputta ("the son of Todeya") towards the Buddha, whose arrival provoked his dog's barking. Indeed, the Buddha has just rep- rimanded the dog for his meanness when a rich man in his previous life. In order to demonstrate that the dog is none other than the reincarnation of Todeya, the housemaster's father, Buddha orders him to go and unearth the family treasure, which is represented by the recipient shown next to the animal. The episode, reported in the Madhyamdgama, existed in Gandharan sculpted panels and passed into the later Life of the Buddha compiled in China and already cited.87 84 Cf. Divyavadana (26), cited by Foucher. The episode was sculpted in the Gandhdra panels, cf. Foucher: I57, fig. z55, in which the Buddha is shown standing up. A Chinese translation of the episode can also be found in the Xianyu jing (SU-tra of the Wise and the Fool) T. zoz02, IV (3): 368c (I7th section). 85 As one can judge from the fragment deposited by the Russian Berezovski, now kept in the Ermitage Museum: Gies and Cohen (eds., as in note I5): cat. 94. 86 The story is told in the Xianyu jing (Sutra of the Wise and the Fool), T. zoz02, IV (3): 370-372 (20oth episode) where the name given to the female beggar is Nanduo, the same transcription as one used for Buddha's handsome cousin and refractory disciple. She is not named in the Tibetan Vinaya of the Malasarvastivadin (cf. Panglung: 35). In the Chi- nese story, the Buddha accepts her entry into religion and promises her that she will reach the Buddhahood Ioo kalpas later. The second source makes it clear that the woman beggar will resuscitate as a Sakyamuni Buddha, and places her offering in the context of hospitality extended by King Prasenajit to the Buddha and to his community, to whom the king has offered many lamps in the hope of a similar prophecy (Panglung: 35). The identification is mentioned by Ma Shichang: 20zo, fig. 27. For a detailed reproduction of the equivalent scene in cave Io8, cf. Duan Wenjie, vol. 3: pl. o108. 87 Todeya is the pdli name quoted in the notes appending to the Chinese translation, while Huber, cited by Foucher, spells it Taudiya. Cf. Foucher: 524-525 and fig. 257b, Shishi yuanliu yinghua shiji: episode 107, and T. 26, I(44): 703c. The scene is reproduced in Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 53, and Duan Wenjie, vol. II: pl I72. 336</page><page sequence="33">Rewards for these famous acts of generosity and punishments for being reluctant to give alms were certainly known by pilgrims. Tales were probably narrated to them during their visit to the sites or during "narrative performance" theatrical plays based on the 'feats' and 'former lives' of the Buddha. Fragments of them have been discovered in Kyzil. From a material point of view, these examples of piety and generosity reminded the pilgrims of their obligation to be charitable towards the Buddhist community, where most of the alms were directed towards shelter, clothing, and food.88 Should its identification be correct, cave I7I's scene at the extreme right of the western sec- tion's lower row could be understood as exhorting the devouts to be generous towards the religious community. Two monks are represented under a tree, one wearing a blue monastic garment, hold- ing a long object in his right hand (maybe a rolled parchment or a stick), and seeming to teach the other, painted lower down, dressed with a green kasdya, his hands joined in a sign of submission. Ma Shichang and Yao Shihong agree that this scene evokes the conditions for religious teaching to succeed, i.e. that disciples be freed from all preoccupation about food.89 In cave I7I, in particular, many scenes of liberality are illustrated, yet too succinctly to allow identification of a particular episode in Buddha's life. One may question whether these scenes all refer to precise moments of Sakyamuni's hagiography, or whether they were intended to stimulate believers to give alms generously. Kyzil depended on this generosity materially, as did the other Kutchan sanctuaries that were densely populated and richly decorated. Some Kutchan inscriptions, notably a passage of the Karmavibhanga that Levi has translated into French, presents an interesting echo to the general invitation to liberality. The English ver- sion says: "Therefore, he who wishes to be happy at all times must give with joy."9o The Buddha's parables or scenes of metaphoric teachings The parables are the third prevailing category to which refer scenes characterized by the motif of the central Buddha painted on mixed ceilings of the Kyzil worship-caves. From a formal point of view, nothing evoked thus far permits them to be distinguished from other events in Buddha's career. This category, established by Yao Shihong, still appears appropriate to describe a significant number of 88 The fourth regular alms-giving concerns medical drugs. Contrary to the three other types of alms, it is accidental. The vital character of these alms donations for the Buddhist community explains the remarkable continuity with which these notable examples continued to be illustrated with the same popularity in China, and until the last two dynas- ties, as exemplified by the illustrated Lives of the Buddha, circulated in print or painted on the walls on Buddhist tem- ples (such as the Shishi yuanliuyinghua shiji already mentioned and the mural paintings of the Jueyuansi in eastern Sichuan, Jiange county). 89 A disciple was unable to learn the sitras when he started to feel hungry. He recovered his faculty of concentration the day that a devotee took charge of his means of subsistence. Cf. Yao Shihong: 74 (no. 62), Ma Shichang: zoz-zo3, no. 38 and fig. o102, and Xianyu jing, T. 2o2, IV (Io): 417a-b (45th section). 90 The fragmentary verses Io to I3 are centered around the act of liberality. Cf. S. Levi, "Fragments de textes koutcheens, Uddnavarga, Udinastotra, Uddnalamkara et Karmavibhanga, publids et traduits avec un vocabulaire et une introduc- tion sur le 'tokharien'" (Kuchan fragmentary texts from the Uddinavarga, Uddinastotra, Udndlamkdara and Karmavib- hanga, published and translated with a vocabulary and an introduction to the "tokharian"), in Cahiers de la Soci&amp;tAsi- atique, first series, Paris, 1933: Io2. 337</page><page sequence="34">scenes with a central Buddha studied here. Even if their precise moral interpretation is not always easy to understand, on the whole, their function seems to encourage religious practice and sensual self-con- trol. These scenes have no known precedents in Indian art or later Chinese paintings.9I They seem specific to Kutchan pictorial art. In most cases, the painter shows the unfortunate rewards of breaching the rules. The only positive parable - one well known to symbolize the ideal advance to nirvana - shows a tree trunk floating un- hindered, carried by the river to the sea. The implicitly described austerities are aimed at controlling the senses generally or rejecting the temptation of lust in particular. Let me start with the parables of general nature. I. The six animals The last scene in cave 34's western section at the right of the second row shows six animals attached to a stake planted in front of the Buddha's throne trying to flee in all directions (fig. 2o). A monk is seated on the left, his hands joined, as if listening to the Buddha's teaching. The six animals - snake, crocodile, dog, jackal, bird, and monkey - illustrate the six-fold sense sphere - eye-sight, ear-hearing, nose-smelling, tongue-taste, body-touch, and mind-thought - each leading to dif- ferent and contradictory activities and sensations unless one exercises restraint or body conscious- ness, symbolized by the stake.91 Indeed, when feeling hungry, the snake tries to enter the burrow, the crocodile to enter the water, the bird to fly in the air, the dog to enter the village, the jackal to visit the charnel field, and the monkey to return to the forest. Only body consciousness allows one's senses to stop the strug- gle to pull oneself toward charming objects. 2. The four venomous serpents The fable of the four venomous serpents, the five enemies, and the six thieves is another parable of even more general nature. It was related in the same section of the treaties of contemplation formed by the mixed agamas (Samyuktdgama). These were translated into English nicely by Rhys Davids. It is represented on cave I7I's barrel vault at the extreme left of the sixth row in the western section as well as in cave 8o's third row of the southern section (fig. 21). A bare-chested man in a long blue loincloth, wearing a necklace, sits on a seat to the right of the Buddha. Next to him appears an open basket from which four heads of serpents emerge. The story tells that a mandarin raises four venomous serpents in a basket, until the day that he realizes that if these reptiles became irritated with him, they could kill him. In a moment of panic, he abandons the basket and runs away, but immediately comes across five murderous foes, armed with knives, who threaten to kill him. Having escaped from them, he hears about a sixth one, who 91 The illustration, painted on the southern wall of Dunhuang cave 257 (dating Northern Wei), of the suicide of the monk to whom a young woman had made advances, is an exceptional Chinese example of loyalty to monastic rules. 92 This story appears in the Saldyatana Book of the P-li version of the Samyuktdgama (L.

Frowde, London, 1884, text IV, 197, XXXV, IV, 5-zo6), and in its Chinese translation in Ioo chapters by Gunab- hadra, the Za a'han jing: T. 99, II (43): 313a-b (verse 27I). See the English transl. by Rhys Davids, The Book of the Kin- dred Sayings, Luzac &amp; Co., London, I950, vol. 4: I30-132 ("The Six Animals," in "Kindred Sayings of the Senses"). 338</page><page sequence="35">yet again, wants to take his life. He finds refuge in an empty village, where all houses he enters are deserted, moldy and crumbling. Learning that robbers are going to plunder the place, he runs away, but his flight soon comes to a halt by a river which bars his way. He builds a makeshift raft, some- how crosses the river, and, crawling on his hands and knees, he reaches the other shore and is finally freed from all his torments.93 The Buddha explains the meaning of this simile to the monks: the four serpents trapped in the basket are a metaphor for the four elements - earth, water, wind, and fire - the empty village alludes to the personal six-fold sense sphere mentioned above... and the other shore (security and safety from fears) is a name for the nirvana, liberation from the hold of the senses over the human being, which has to be reached through effort. 3. The pigeon, the raven, the serpent, and the deer If its interpretation is correct, the scene represented in cave I71's half-lozenge situated at the extreme left of the third row in the western vault section may also refer to general appeasement of the passions: Buddha presents the sufferings caused by carnal desire, hunger and thirst, anger and fear - all hindrances to Enlightenment - as the worst fears, respectively, of the pigeon, raven, ser- pent, and deer.94 The Uddnavarga presents the four animals as previous incarnations of the four monks to whom Buddha delivers this teaching. Hence this metaphor may be assimilated as a "pre- vious life" tale, which explains the absence of the Buddha figure and its replacement by the figure of an ascetic, identified by Waldschmidt as Viryabala.95 4. The log of wood floating without hindrance The advance towards liberation promised by the nirvdna is exceptionally illustrated in the parable of the tree trunk floating without hindrance to the sea. It suggests a fluid process rather than a fran- tic race on a road full of obstructions. To the left, a bhiksu sits on a cushion, hands joined. Under the throne of Buddha, there is a green expanse of water over which a long object floats (fig. 22). Yao Shihong recognizes here the great log of wood mentioned in the parable in which the Buddha compares its free float toward the ocean to the attitude of detachment required to reach the nirvdna. As the monk comes to report his achievements to the Buddha, the Buddha tells him that he should progress without attachment and without breaching his practice, just as the log of wood advances without being stranded on either bank, without sinking or being stopped by any islet, without being caught in the whirlpools or rotting inwardly. So should the monk progress until he 93 This story appears in the Saldyatana Book of the Samyutta-nikdya (text IV, 197, XXXV, IV, 5-197: Asivisa), and in its Chinese translation mentioned above, the Za ahan jing: T. 99, II (43): 313b-c (verse 272) (cf. Yao Shihong: 148). See the English transl. in Davids. (as above): vol. 4: Io7-IIo ("The snake"). 94 This story is narrated in the chapter "On the appeasement [of the passions]" (anning pin: section 25) of the Faju piyu jing, one of two principal Chinese translations of the Uddnavarga, cf. T. 211, IV (3): 594c-595b. 95 Lecoq and Waldschmidt (as in note 2), vol. 7: 42-43, where the scene described belongs to the vaulted ceiling of cave II4. This scene is also illustrated in two more caves, of which 17 is exclusively decorated with jdtaka scenes (Yao Shi- hong: 75 [no. 651, 93 and 122). For a detailed reproduction of the scene, see Duan Wenjie, vol. II: pl. 186 or Su Bai, vol. I: pl. 67. 339</page><page sequence="36">reaches the final reward of nirvdna without falling into the stream of lure and lust or into the sor- rows and pleasures of the senses.96 Retribution for evil behavior is illustrated in the parables about a prisoner who is tortured unceas- ingly by blows with a lance and of a blind tortoise who sticks his head through a hole in a drifting plank. 5. The bandit hit three hundred times The parable of a bandit hit 300 times with a spear without the respite of death illustrates deserved infernal punishment for licentious behavior. To the right, a bare-chested man, dressed in a blue loincloth with a white turban on his head and his left knee on the ground, has his hands bound behind his back (fig. 23). His left shoulder is pierced by a three-pronged fork. This seems to justify identification by Yao Shihong of the metaphor of a thief caught red-handed and handed over to the king for exemplary punishment: The king orders that he should be pierced Ioo times with a lance at dawn; then, seeing that he is still alive, Ioo more blows are inflicted at noon, and Ioo more in the evening, until the body looks like a holed coin. The Buddha resorts to this metaphor to illustrate the everlasting torments of hell promised to the dishonest.97 6. The Blind Tortoise The metaphor of the blind tortoise is illustrated in cave 171 (fourth scene of the sixth row in the western section): on the right, a monk kneels with his hands joined. There is an expanse of green water behind the Buddha's throne. A floating wooden plank has a hole through which a tortoise passes its head (fig. 24). This story comes soon after the preceding one in the Chinese translation of the Madhyamdgama, when the Buddha describes the sufferings endured by those born in the animal phase for lack of wisdom. He tells this to illustrate the difficulty of transmigration into the human phase once one has fallen into the animal one. The probability of good transmigration is just as likely as the chance of a blind tortoise passing its neck through the hole of a drifting plank pushed by the wind on a river. 9 96 Cf. the fourth scene in the second row of cave I7I's barrel vault in the western section, in Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 8, and Yao Shihong: 153 (fig.- 7), I54-155. As the first two previous episodes, this one appears in the Samyutta-nikdya (text IV, 197, XXXV, IV, 5-200: Darukkhandha) and its Chinese translation (Za ahan jing, T. 99, II [43]: 314c: verse 274). See Davids (as in note 89), vol. 4: 113-116 ("The log of wood"). 97 The scene is at the extreme left of the second row in cave I71's eastern section vault. Cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 8. In the Chinese translation of the Madhyamdgama by Gautama Samghadeva, the king is named Shalidingsheng, said to cor- respond to the Indian name Khattiyamuddhdvasitta (Zhong ahan jing, T. 26, I [53]: 759c-76oa). 98 This is a parable used to illustrate the fruits of Ignorance, as opposed to Wisdom, to which the chapter is devoted (T. 26, I [53]: 76Ib-c). See Yao Shihong: I46 (fig. 2), 147, and Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 8. 340</page><page sequence="37">7. The child strangled in a well The parable of the child strangled in a well is an explicit warning against lust, represented within the cave 171 vault's third scene in the third row of the western section (fig. 25) and in cave 80 (extreme right).99 A woman stands on one side of the Buddha, while the head of a child seems to be caught in a rope, emerging from the top of a rectangular construction representing a well. The episode, identified by Ma Shichang, has been translated into French by Chavannes: a mother, having come to the well with her child to draw water, meets a handsome lute player. In order not to be dis- turbed while she is carrying on with the player, she attaches the child. But, in the middle of her pleasures, she does not notice that the child has fallen into the well and that the rope is strangling him.0oo This episode, related in the section on carnal desire of the Chuyao jing, a Chinese translation of a Uddnavarga version with commentary, probably illustrates the following verses: "O Desire, I know your root; it is in the imagination that you are born. I shall not imagine you, and you will not be born in me. "Io1 8. The monkey trapped on sticky grass The parable of the monkey trapped on sticky grass, illustrated on the upper row of cave 80's pre- served vault section, and still more explicitly in cave 224 (fig. 26), is also a warning against sen- sory stains in this world. A ginger-colored monkey is shown leaning forward, hands and feet stuck on a square surface. In a mountainous region, peopled with men and monkeys, a hunter applies onto the grass a glue made from glutinous millet. The clever monkey, who saw him do it, walks away from the trap, whereas an idiot monkey, attracted by the smell, is caught, sticking first one front leg, then the second, then the back legs, then his mouth until his whole body collapses and he is caught by the hunter. o2 This parable seems to be a particular warning against the temptations to which the monks are likely to be subjected when they beg for food in the secular world. 99 Cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 9, and vol. II: pl. 53, and Ma Shichang: 200oo, fig. 93. Ioo Cf. E. Chavannes (as in note 47) vol. III: 268-269, no. 478, in which the story is translated from the Chinese Buddhist compilation produced under Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty, theJinglii yixiang. IoI See the French translation by N. P. Chakravarti, L'Uddnavarga sanskrit (Mission Pelliot en Asie Centrale, unfinished edition), A. Maisonneuve, Paris, I930, vol. I. The exact Chinese translation of the same stanza is found in the Chuyao- jing, T. 212, IV (4): 626c-627a. The story of the child strangled in the well is placed between several repetitions of the same stanza. The same story is found in the Vinaya of the Mu-lasarvastivadin, in which the young woman meets the Buddha in despair for the death of the child, converts, and reaches sainthood (cf. Panglung: 25). 102 This episode is told in "The Great Chapter on the Stations of Mindfulness" of the Samyutta-nikdya already cited (text V, 146, III, I/7: Makkata) and in the Chinese translation of the Samyuktdgama (T. 99, II [24]: I73b-c: verse 620). See Yao Shihong: 147-148 and Davids (as in note 89): vol. 5: 127-128. For a reproduction of the scene, see Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 53 (cave 80). A more explicit version, in which the hunter appears to carry away his prey, is seen in cave 224 (cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 151, first full-lozenge scene of the upper row in the eastern section). 341</page><page sequence="38">Finally, two scenes, situated one above the other on the vaulted ceiling of cave 34, are inter- preted as two metaphors intended by the Buddha for his young son Rahula. They illustrate the unfortunate consequences of telling lies. 9. R-ahula and the jug of water At the center of the third row in the vault's western section, a young monk, left knee on the ground, holds a jug of water in his right hand and the tail of his monastic coat in his left hand. A large cup is lying on the ground in front of the Buddha, who has just kicked it away with his left foot (fig. 27). 13 In order to stop his son Rahula, who is a young novice seven years old, from telling lies, the Buddha orders him to take a basin and to wash his feet. He asks him then, if it were possible to use it for cooking. Rahula says no, and understands the lesson about lies, which may lead to compara- ble consequences. Then, the Buddha throws the basin onto the ground and kicks it with his feet, and asks Rahula whether he is afraid that it may break. The negative reply from his son gives way to a further reprimand, because - though you are a Shaman, yet being unable to guard your mouth or your tongue, you are destined, as a small and insignificant thing, to be whirled in the endless eddies oftrans- migration - an object of contempt to all the Wise.104 Io. The elephant who leaves the sword The second scene, painted just above the previous one, on the upper row of the same vault section, represents a young monk, standing with his head bowed as a sign of obedience to the Buddha; below him is an elephant lying down, in front of which is painted a sword, set on the ground (fig. 28). In the Faju piyujing, the other known Chinese translation of the Uddnavarga, the metaphor of the elephant is associated with a warning against lies, translated by Beal as follows: "Let them guard against the arrow that strikes in the middle! Let them keep their mouth, lest they die and fall into the misery of future births in the three evil paths!"ios The Buddha explains to his son that telling lies is as serious as the mistake of a war elephant who, instead of keeping the most vulnerable part of his body, his trunk, down, rolls it up to catch a sword and engages in the hostilities. An ele- phant that shows such excessive ardor during combat as to forget the mortal danger of exposing his trunk to enemy arrows should be removed from the army. Telling lies is thus presented as the first of the Io faults and condemns the liar to a rebirth in the three evil paths.'o? An equivalent scene is painted on the last row (second scene) of cave 80, except that no monk is painted and the sword is set vertically in the trunk of an elephant, which is lying down. It is impossible to know whether this refers to the same parable or illustrates the attack led against the 103 Cf. Su Bai, vol. III: pl. 78. 104 See Faju piyu jing (T. 2II, IV: 599 [33rd section]), and its English translation, S.

Indeed, Gandharan reliefs showed the ele- phant, attacking the Buddha, charging with a weapon in his trunk, which some sources identify as a sword.1o7 This is a good example of the difficulty of interpreting scenes on vaults characterized by the central Buddha pattern. Nevertheless, it is likely that both scenes have been depicted on vaults in cave 34, which may be distinguished because ofa figure represented next to the elephant. Indeed, the third scene in the eastern section's second row not only depicts an elephant lying down (with- out a weapon) but includes a young man in lay dress instead of the monk represented in the scene on the vault's opposite section (fig. 29). This young man may be identified as Devadatta, a cousin of the Buddha, after his releasing drunken elephants had failed to kill the Buddha. Otherfeats of the Buddha There are a few painted scenes in the vaulted ceilings of the "mixed" type that cannot be ranked among the three thematic categories outlined above. They may still be mentioned briefly. They include the First Sermon of the Buddha in the Deer Park ofBenares 1os (fig. 29), a scene often depicted in a larger scale on the caves' main walls;Io9 the self-portrait painted by the Buddha (fig. 30) to allow and spread his cult (based on his image that the other painters had failed to achieve)o; and the Miraculous Crossing of the Ganges."' Another scene seems to illustrate the Conversion of Ugrasena, who had broken all ties with his noble family and was living as a strolling player, for the sake of his beloved female dancer."1 107 Su Bai, vol. II: pl. 53; Foucher: fig. 75,267-269, and the Chinese translation of the Ekottardagama, T. 125, II (9): 59oa-59Ia. IO8 The second scene, second row, eastern section in cave I7I, is characterized by the presence of two deers, painted symet- rically on the throne upon which the Buddha is sitting. To the right of the Buddha, a kneeling monk probably sym- bolizes the first five disciples of the Buddha, who renounce their former ascetic practice. It is thus an implicit recog- nition of the superiority of the Law of the Buddha over other practices. log There is a very beautiful example on the right side wall in cave 224 (Su Bai, vol. 3: pl. 136). IIO This is the case regarding scenes situated at the third row of the eastern section in caves 34 (to the extreme left of the six preserved scenes) and 171 (second scene of the five with a central Buddha): the Buddha holds a paintbrush in his right hand, which he brings onto a rectangular canvas presented to him by a monk, who holds it by the upper cor- ners. Several similar stories describe kings, who worry whether they will be able to imagine the Buddha after his death but resolve the problem by the miraculous intervention of the Buddha, who either paints his self-portrait or repro- duces his effigy instantaneously in a myriad-fold. The Xianyu jing (Sfitra of the Wise and the Fool), quoted by Ma Shichang, presents King Bosaiqi (Vasuki?) as the patron of 84, ooo pictures painted after the model made by the Bud- dha himself, whose image the artists could not capture. These effigies were then distributed to the same number of countries in order to allow them to venerate the Buddha. The story comes right after the Offering of Dust by the child who will later be born as King A'oka. This forms an association between both patron kings and the legendary figure of paintings or pagodas which they sponsor. See T. 202, IV (3): 368c-369a (I7th section). The Guanfo sanmei hai jing (T. 643, XV) gives another version, in which the Buddha produces a series of images of himself, according to the vision- ary practice of the Samadhi to appease the anxiety of King Suddh6dana at the idea of Sakyamuni disappearing. This last episode is illustrated in the already mentioned Chinese Life of the Buddha, Shishi yuanliu yinghua shiji (Events and Conversions of the Buddha, 1425: episode 93). III In the scene situated at the extreme left of the lower row in cave 80's vault, the Buddha appears seated, not on his usual throne but on a long-shaped object ending with a dragon head, painted on the surface of an expanse of water. A man holding a stick disappearing into the water sits next to him.

CHRONOLOGICAL DIVERGENCES AND LIMITS OF IDENTIFICATION Problems of dating The controversial dating of the caves I have based this study on ought to be outlined here. As I have said, the chronology of the Kyzil sanctuary is still being debated. Von Le Coq, Waldschmidt, and Pel- liot used to group paintings of the Kyzil caves (and of Duldur Aqur) under two styles - the first, so- called Gandharan, dating from the 6th century, and the second, so-called Indo-Iranian, going back to the first halfofthe 7th century, before 658.113 The Chinese scholars and some American scholars, includ- ing Howard, already quoted, believe that the earlier paintings may date back to as early as the 3rd or 4th centuries.II4 Before I emphasize the problem of dating caves 34, 80, and 171, I would like to recall briefly the two types of chronology proposed by Chinese scholars, based on CI4 tests and stylistic interpretation. The first CI4 tests were carried out by teams of Beijing University, led by Su Bai in 1979-1981. The tests were done in eight caves on samples of wood found in relics of Sumeru high-reliefs made of clay and on wisps of straw taken from the layer of preparation. Based on these measurements, Su Bai divides the caves into three periods: a) 310 +/- 80 to 350 +/- 60; b) 395 +/- 65 to the beginning of the 6th century; c) 545 +/-75 to 685 +/- 65s5. Huo Xuchu and Wang Jianlin, from the Research Institute of Kyzil, proceeded to a new series of measurements with carbon 14, in collaboration with the Institute of Archeology of the Academy of Social Sciences of China. They then set up a chronology including four periods: I) 3rd century to the end of the first half of the 4th century,"6 2) The "development" phase: mid-4th-_ th centuries; 113 Cf. the synthesis of these datings by Yaldiz: 33-35. 114 See note Io. II5 The second phase itself lacks consistency, for it combines CI4 measurements - 395 +/- 65 to 465 +/- 65 - with a sub- jective extension of the period until the "beginning of the 6th century" - cf. Su Bai, "Kezi'er shiku bufen dongku jied- uan huafen yu niandai deng wenti de chubu tansuo" (Preliminary Study of the Classification by periods and of the ques- tion of datings of some caves in Kyzil), in Su Bai, vol. I: 10-23, zo20; and Ma Shichang's previously quoted "Kezi'er zhongx- inzhuku zhushi juanding yu houshi de bihua" (Mural Paintings of the Vaults in the Main and Rear Chambers...), in Zhongguo shiku - Kezi'er shiku, vol. II, pp. 174-226. 116 In order to formulate the hypothesis of his first phase, Huo Xuchu bases himself on the CI4 dating concerning cave 118, which were, briefly, [8o to I3O A.D.], and which he then reinterprets into [75 to 322 A.D.] (cf. Archaeology Insti- 346</page><page sequence="43">3) the "apogee" phase: 6th_-7th centuries, 4) the decline phase: 8th_gth centuries, characterized by the repetitive motif of the I,ooo Buddhas, of Chinese influence."1 The authors of this general classification believe that the worship caves dug around a central pillar appeared during the "development" phase and reached their full maturity in the "apogee" phase. The decor of the vaulted ceilings in these caves would have first given priority tojataka scenes during the "development" phase and then become more complex, relegating the jdtakas (in the lower rows) in order to emphasize scenes with the central Buddha, which have been the focus of this discussion. According to this, the paintings studied above would thus belong to the 6th and 7th centuries. Yet the CI4 tests and their interpretations, as applied to caves 34, 80, and 171 in particular, do not match this general chronology. Situated at the east of the gorge, cave 171 is the largest of the three, and it is joined to its neighboring cave 172 in the antechamber. Its dating by carbon 14 represents some gap between Huo Xuchu (410 +9o/-50o) and Su Bai, who puts it at 395 +/- 65.1s Huo Xuchu's affilia- tion of cave 171 to his "development" phase contradicts his affiliation of the other large caves with a central pillar to the "apogee phase," a phase in which he observes a generalization of the architecture by pairs of caves. Although he does not propose any explanation, this exception reserved to cave 171 represents a gap of two centuries. The disagreement between Su Bai and Huo Xuchu is still more important for the two other caves: while Su Bai sets cave 34 in period b) (395 +/- 65 to 465 +/-65),19 Huo Xuchu places it in his "apogee phase," i.e., 6th_-7th centuries.,2o Concerning cave 80, in which Su Bai sees an old cell of meditation transformed into a worship cave with a central pillar, it is affiliated to phase a): 31o +/- 8o to 350 +/-6o,,' while Huo Xuchu sees it as a typical cave of the "apogee phase" (6th_7th centuries). This represents another gap of interpretation tute of the Social Academy of Sciences, Zhongguo kaoguxue zhong tanshisi niandai shujuji, I965-I9p9, (Measurements with carbon r4 in Chinese Archeology, rp65-9pp-), Wenwu, Beijing, 1991: 324, ZK 2455). By stylistic comparison based notably on the naturalistic style of mountains peaks painted in the scenes illustrated on the vaulted ceilings, Huo Xuchu then affiliates a number of other caves - 77, 92, 47, 48, and 117 - with this first phase, cf. Huo Xuchu and Wang Jianlin: 1-30. One ought to be very cautious while reading these carbon 14 measurements and their interpretations, especially when reading the margins of error, which curiously vary from cave to cave. Measurements carried out by the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Social Sciences resulted in cave 77, for instance, providing the following dating: [60 to I B.C.], which was changed after an unexplained calculation to [92 to 130o A.D.]. Cf. Archaeology Institute... (as above): 323, ZK 245o. 117 The most representative caves of this last phase are situated at the eastern end of the site, up on the hill. There are very few caves and small of size. These are cave 180, for which the carbon 14 measurements give the dating (86o +95/-110o), and cave 197. 118 Su Bai, vol. I: 19. ii9 Su Bai, vol. I: 18. I2zo Huo Xuchu and Wang Jianlin: 2I. The dating carried out by the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Social Sciences again differs: 260-3IO A.D., modified to 262-531 A.D., cf. Archaeology Institute... (as in note 113): 323, ZK 2448. I2i Su Bai, vol. I: 18. 347</page><page sequence="44">of 20zoo to 400 years. Formerly, the German scholar Klimburg dated it from the second half of the 6th century.123 Thus, according to these authors, the three caves are dated in a range varying for each of them from the 4th to the 7th centuries. The interpretation of Su Bai claims cave 8o to be the oldest, while Huo Xuchu would classify cave 171 as the oldest. Of the three caves, although the vaulted decor of cave 171 is the best preserved, it presents less per- sonalized scenes than those in the other two caves. The iconographical elements of the scenes are more laconic and repetitive, to the point that I question whether certain scenes had not become general invi- tations for almsgiving rather than illustrations of particular episodes in the life of the Buddha. By com- parison, scenes painted on the vaults of cave 34 are more detailed, as, for instance, those illustrating the Conversion ofthe Butcher and the miracle of yotiska being savedfrom the fre. This richer narrative of the scenes on the ceiling of cave 34 is also found in theparable of the elephant who abandons his sword, in which a monk was depicted in cave 34 (fig. 28), and has disappeared in cave 80. The scene of the Sub- duing of Mdra showed two figures in cave 34 (the lower half has collapsed), including a demon painted in blue in the gesture of drawing a bow, as opposed to the single figure of cave 171. Lastly, a still unidentified scene that may illustrate a miracle of the Buddha or admission of a poor person into the religion, is also more richly illustrated in cave 34 than in cave 171: in cave 34 (extreme left in the sec- ond row of the western section) (fig. 4), the Buddha's left hand holds the head of a very emaciated youth sitting on a stool, while he extends his right hand, as if to receive an object offered by a person in the guise of a god (halo). This third figure has been omitted in the scene of cave I7I (extreme left in the third row of the western section).124 Thus, while we await more precise scientific measurements, the detailed comparison of the three caves would indicate that the ceiling decor in cave 34 was painted earlier than those of caves 8o and 171. Limits ofIdentification through non-indigenous Buddhist scriptures Although the general meaning of the parables became roughly understandable, thanks to references to the Chinese Buddhist scriptures or their Indian predecessors, it ought to be noted that the moral precepts they are related to may vary from one source to the other. Some parables have been identified from tales inserted within the Udanavarga verses. The translation of Kutchan fragments brought back to Europe in the Uddndlankara - a kind of illustrated commentary of the Uddnavarga - is unfortu- nately too limited or too sketchy to allow precise connection with scenes depicted on the caves' barrel vaults.'5s Thus the proposed identifications were based on Sanskrit versions or Chinese and Tibetan translations known of the Udanavarga, or its Southern equivalent, the Dhammapada. Comparing these versions now shows that the same tales may be linked to different verses and may therefore have illus- trated a slightly different moral. The parable of the basin which Rahula uses to clean the feet of the 122 Huo Xuchu and Wang Jianlin: 17. 123 Cf. Yaldiz: 35, quoting M. Klimburg, 1969, 140. 124 Su Bai, vol. 3: pl. 5. I25 Levi, S., (as in note 86): 72-77 ("The Uddndlamkdra"). 348</page><page sequence="45">Buddha is a good example: in the Faju piyu jing, it appears in the "elephant" chapter, while in the Chuyao jing, as in the Tibetan version, it is included in the "acts" chapter.126 It is likely that the tales were derived from books of narrative examples 17 and that the Kutchans introduced some arrangements of their own. 4. CONCLUSION While we await the light that translations of the Kutchan epigraphy may further shed on such decor, the general significance of the parables illustrated in them ought to be underscored. They encourage a severe asceticism and a general defense of the six-fold sense sphere - eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body, and mind - against all sorts of temptations that would cause the monk to fall back into ignorance. They reflect a quasi-obsessive call to self-control described in the Udndlankadra, of which indigenous fragments have been found.8 Whereas much of the narrative in the Life of the Buddha will travel fur- ther east right into China (such as in the illustrated biography of the Buddha, the Shishi yuanliu, which spread widely between the I5th and 19th centuries) )9 and Japan, these austere parables seem to charac- terize the vaulted decors of the Kyzil caves. This predominance of ascetic rigor, without equivalent in Chinese Buddhist iconography, seems to denote the influence of the Small Vehicle. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who stopped in Kutcha on his way to India in 629-630, witnessed the activity of the Sarvastivadin Small Vehicle school. Kyzil, as well as other Kutchan caves, may have been influenced, more exactly, by the so-called Malasarvas- 126 Cf. Chuyao jing, T. 212, IV (ii): 668a (section 9: "Xingpi"), in which comparison of dirty water in the basin seems to be more important. The lesson translated from the Tibetan by Rockhill is as follows: "Well, Rahula, thou foolish man, who hast shunned the rules of virtue ( who hast lied), thou art like that (dirty water left in the basin ), I declare! He who knowingly tells lies, who is immodest, without shame and who repents him not, is cast out of the priesthood, as is thrown away this (dirty water)," Rockhill (as above), appendix: 20o-2o6. The verses which illustrate this story in the Chuyao jing were translated into the following Chinese: "yifa guoqu wei wangyu ren bu mian houshi wu'e bu geng", which corresponds roughly to the French translation proposed by Chakravarti of the first verse of the Karmavarga in the Sanskrit Uddnavarga: "A man who has transgressed a single law, whose speech is false, and who despises the other world, there is no crime which he does not commit" (transl. from Chakravarti [as in note 96]: 96). Although both Chi- nese translations Faju piyu jing and Chuyao jing - the later corresponding to the Tibetan version translated by Rock- hill - relate the parable of Rahula's basin, which has served to clean the Buddha's feet with the act of lying, the the- matic framework and conclusions differ. 127 Comparison of the Sanskrit fragments brought back from Chinese Turkestan by Pelliot, Rockhill, and others, with their presumed Chinese translations, demonstrates the variable character of the link of a story with a particular stanza or theme. The table showing correspondance between stanzas of the Pali Dhammapada, the Tibetan Uddnavarga (trans- lated into English by Rockhill), the Faju piyu fing (translated into English by Beal), and the Sutta Nipdta also shows the mobile and adaptable character of the verses collected in these different sources (cf. Rockhill, The Uddnavarga, index: 217-222). 128 "Unless the mind has been trained with the Four Exercises [...], the rain of passions unceasingly (beats) it. It destroys it. [...] Whose mind has not been trained through self-control [...], following the wisai (= skt: visaya: the sensual objects) [...]," see S. Levi (as in note 86): 74-75. 129 See E. Lesbre, as in note 62. 349</page><page sequence="46">tivddin school, whose creation in India can be situated around the 4th-5th centuries.-30 Epigraphic doc- umentation in Sanskrit or Kutchan discovered in the neighborhood of Kyzil seems to indicate the influence of this school too.3s' And many scenes depicting the Life of the Buddha in Kyzil have been identified in the vinaya texts of this latter school. This was the case for quite a number of vault scenes I have presented, such as the Subduing ofHdriti, the Subduing of the Gandharva-king Musician (Supriya, Chin. transl.: Shan'ai), the Subduing ofSrigupta who attempted to give poisonous food to the Buddha, the story of the Adulterous Woman whose son perishes in the well, the Conversion of the Father ofJyotiska; the denunciation of the False Pregnancy of Circa Mdnavika, and the Crossing of the Ganges on a bridge temporarily made of the heads of ndgas. All were traced in the Chinese and Tibetan scriptural trans- lations related to the discipline of the M-lasarvastivadin school. The iconographic analysis conducted by Ma Shichang, Ding Mingyi, and Xiong Xi of scenes in the life of the Buddha represented on the side walls of caves in Kyzil was also essentially based on the Chinese translation of that school's books on discipline.132 In order to provoke the viewers' feeling of contempt for lust, it is interesting to note use of the image of unchaste women. Such was the case in the story of the Adulterous Woman whose son perishes in the well. The scene showing a woman, sitting next to the Buddha, and an open basket containing sev- eral men's heads, probably illustrates the similar tale of the Unchaste Wife and her lovers' basket (left end of 2nd row in the eastern section of cave 34's ceiling: fig. 3 b; and 2nd scene in the 2nd row at the south- ern section of cave 80's vault: fig. zi21). While the merchant Dhanadeva was away, his wife would sneak a different lover into her house every night by having them hide in a basket that would be brought in by servants. The story goes on to say that the unchaste wife, who was drunk, failed to recognize her own husband when he was brought into the house in the same manner. As a result, the man became disgusted with his wife and decided to become a recluse.133 The illustration of such stories with demo- nized women on the ceilings of the Kyzil caves is somehow contradicted by the strikingly sensual images of women depicted in the royal couples on side-walls of the same sanctuary. These reflect the height of Kutchan painting.134 This pictorial and moral ambiguity is quite specific to the art of Kutcha and apparently stopped at the Chinese border. 130o See E. Lamotte, Histoire du Bouddhisme indien, Louvain, Bibliothique du Museon, 1958, vol. I: 727. The Sarvdstivddin - whose name means "those who teach that everything exists" - probably appeared around the 3rd century B.c.. They dominated Northwestern India and the district of Mathura. The Chinese pilgrim Yi Jing is the first one who men- tions the Mulasarvdstivddin as one of four schools derived from the Sarvdstivddin. They dominated Northern India (Cashmere and Northern Punjab) and were numerous in Magadha at the end of the 7th century. Yet the difference between the two schools is unclear (Lamotte, as above: 581, 587, 602). Their ideal doctrines were summarized in A. Bareau, Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit VWhicule (Publications de l'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme Orient Series), Paris, 1955: 133-154. 131 From a linguistic point of view, study of the Kutchan epigraphy would seemingly indicate the influence of the Mflasarvastivadin sect (cf. Pinault, as in note I:I3). 132 Over 40 of the 61 scenes studied have been identified in the Genben shuo yiqieyou bu pinaiye posengshi (T. 1450), and a dozen in the Genben shuoyiqieyou bu pinaiye zashi (T. I45I), cf. Su Bai, vol. I: 218-219. 133 This scene is depicted in cave 34 (left end of the second row on the Eastern vault, fig. 3), and in cave 80 (fig. 21). I have not yet found any version of this story earlier than the Kashmirian tale collected in Somadeva's Kathd sarit sdgara (dated around Io70), see C. Tawney. (transl.) and N. Penzer, The Ocean ofstory, Grafton House, London, 1924, vol. 5: 145-148. 350</page><page sequence="47">Understanding the "mixed ceilings" of the Kyzil worship caves will hopefully be improved even more by further investigations - iconographical and textual - on the biography of the Buddha. Clarifications may also be expected from study and translation of indigenous texts found in Kyzil, espe- cially of fragments of Buddhist plays (ndtaka) derived from the "Previous Lives" and "Exploits" tales, which may reveal Kutchan adaptations.135 Frequently Cited Sources - Duan Wenjie (chief ed.), Zhongguo xinjiang bihua quanji, Kezi'er, Tianjin renmin meishu, Tianjin (China), 1992-1995, 3 vols. - Foucher, A., Les bas-reliefs greco-Boudhiques du Gandhdra; E.
