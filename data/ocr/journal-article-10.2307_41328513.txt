<plain_text><page sequence="1">Faulkner's Closest to God in The Sound and the Fury Aaron Moore Florida State University Jean-Paul Sartre tells us that man yearns to be as solid as a thing. In order to understand more fully the implications of this statement we need to first define Sartre's two modes of being: Being-In-Itself ( en-soi ) and Being-For-Itself ( pour - soi) {Being and Nothingness 29-30). Being-For-Itself signifies the world of be- coming or doing confined to human reality and Being-In-Itself signifies the world of being or having (Sowder 164). As Sartre tells us, the Being-In-Itself is the static being of objects.1 It is being that is unaware of itself. In essence it is pure positivity.2 The rock or table or chair exists in-itself - its being rests in itself. The en- soi represents phenomenological solidity, or thickness, if you will: "Being in- itself has no within which is opposed to a without and which is analogous to a judgment, a law, a consciousness of itself. The in-itself has nothing secret; it is solid (massif) {Being and Nothingness 28). The rock is not aware it exists. It is not conscious. The rock is in no tension with the world. It has no decisions to make and nothing for which to be held responsible: "the possible is a structure of the for-itself; that is, it belongs to the other region of being. Being-in-itself is never either possible or impossible. It is. This is what consciousness expresses in anthropomorphic terms by saying that being is superfluous {de trop) - that is, that consciousness absolutely can not derive being from anything, either from another being, or from a possibility, or from a necessary law. Uncreated, without reason for being, without any connection with another being, being-in-itself is de trop for eternity" {Being and Nothingness 29). Should the rock break or melt it simply becomes something else. Matter cannot be created nor destroyed; it only changes forms. En-soi is not subject to time. It is outside of time and trans- cends it. Time requires consciousness to designate past, present and future. Be- ing-in-itself is not conscious because it is what it is according to Sartre. Time is the realm of the possible and created.3 Whenever something is possible it is sim- ultaneously posited what is not possible - this is the negation at the heart of hu- man consciousness. I am conscious of being hungry. If I am hungry then that must mean I am not full. If I am full then I am not empty. The quality or state of hunger cannot exist in a vacuum. The affirmation of hunger is contingent on not- hunger. I am conscious of being lazy. If I am lazy then I am not productive. There exist other planes of possibility once human consciousness posits itself as something - always positioned against what it is not. Briefly, we will need to define the pour-soi mode of being - Being-for-itself.4 The pour-soi is the being of humankind. It is consciousness that is aware of itself - self-conscious. Con- 77</page><page sequence="2">sciousness requires negation, whereas being-in-itself is pure affirmation. I, as a self-conscious being, must always posit what I am not in order to posit what I am. The structure of the pour-soi is translucent - luminous in a way. Pour-soi , as mentioned before, is solid. Because humanity is always in the realm of the conditional and the possible, an individual will never know what one is. The only identity available to an individual comes from one's past as the sum of one's actions; and yet, a human being can never fully claim he or she is a cow- ard or a hero or a narcissist - all of those traits hinge on decision, and humanity is always a capacity to become. Humankind has no essence or pattern of behav- ior. Human reality "is what it is not and ... is not what it is" (100). Negation is required for human consciousness and the core of this consciousness is nothing- ness. It must be so because a human being as an ever-potential //-conditional must have no ontological foundation in order to truly be conditional as a capaci- ty to become. The for-itself is only the foundation of itself as nothingness. As Sartre tells us, "The for-itself, as the foundation of itself, is the upsurge of nega- tion. The for-itself founds itself in so far as it denies in relation to itself a certain being or a mode of being. What it denies or nihilates, as we know, is being-in- itself. But no matter what being-in-itself: human reality is before all else its own nothingness" (138). This seems a reversal of Descartes's famous "I think, there- fore I am." What one might say in light of Sartre's theory is "I think, therefore I am not" (Ciancio 77). It is the fictitious and contradictory synthesis of the en-soi substance of pure positivity of the object-universe with the consciousness of the pour-soi of hu- man reality that Sartre expresses philosophically as God. In a Sartrean sense, God is not the traditional anthropomorphic deity or deities espoused by many religions. God is essentially the universe - both en-soi and pour-soi - out of tension and unified. In this way, and as one would expect, God cannot ever be expressed in human terms since Sartre's philosophical God is not logically or rationally possible. The idea of God is transcendent. In light of Sartrean theory, a being can never be both pour-soi and en-soi unless the two terms suffer an equivocation which would unravel all of Sartre's argument. God is somehow all positivity as en-soi and yet conscious as pour-soi, but Sartre's definition of con- sciousness hinges on negation: human reality "is what it is not and ... is not what it is" (100). Sartre's conclusion of God cannot rest on a logically or empir- ically supported hypothesis. Sartre merely hypothesizes that according to his theory the name of God may simply mean the union of en-soi and pour-soi : "Let no one reproach us with capriciously inventing a being of this kind; when by a further movement of thought the being and absolute absence of this totality are hypostasized as transcendence beyond the world, it takes on the name of God. Is not God a being who is what he is - in that he is all positivity and the foundation of the world - and at the same time a being who is not what he is and who is what he is not - in that he is self-consciousness and the necessary foundation of 78</page><page sequence="3">himself?" (140). Sartre wisely addresses the question of God as a question be- cause God could only stand as a foundation of himself without proof and with- out needing proof because he is what he is. Humanity seeks to be God. God is unreachable and unachievable, but man may get closer to God through his pas- sions - longing through instinct and passion to be is rather than is not - longing through instinct and passion to be as solid as a thing. We yearn, uselessly, to be a contradictory God - a being that meshes freedom and lucidity with the funda- mental impenetrability of objects - an en-soi and pour-soi synthesis (Kaufman 47). In the words of Sartre in the concluding chapter of Being and Nothingness , Each human reality is at the same time a direct project to metamor- phose its own For-itself into an In-itself-For-itself and a project of the appropriation of the world as a totality of being-in-itself, in the form of a fundamental quality. Every human reality is a passion in that it pro- jects losing itself so as to found being and by the same stroke to consti- tute the In-itself which escapes contingency by being its own founda- tion, the Ens causa sui, which religions call God. Thus the passion of man is the reverse of that of Christ, for man loses himself as man in or- der that God may be born. But the idea of God is contradictory and we lose ourselves in vain. Man is a useless passion. (784) Thus, in human reality the strive for en-soi, the strive to be as solid as a thing, is synonymous with the strive for God. Man is pour-soi striving for en-soi. The en- soi in itself is not representative of God. This is a crucial point. The object- universe is not what Sartre terms God - Nature or matter in general is not syn- onymous with God existentially. The theoretical God is produced in man's im- age. God is an In-itself-For-itself metamorphosis that can only exist hypotheti- cally, yet, man will always strive for this union (Sowder 164-65). In a sense, one might term Sartre's God as an anthropomorphized object. But man can get or be closer to God which is the concern of this essay in relation to Faulkner's charac- ters. This essay sets out to prove that Quentin Compson and Benjy Compson from The Sound and the Fury demonstrate behavior or thought patterns that ei- ther exhibit their closeness to God or exhibit their drive to be closer to God. In The Sound and the Fury Quentin Compson is haunted by time - anguished in light of the future and haunted by the past.5 Quentin is so obsessed with the past that his monologue shifts backwards in time about two hundred times. Benjy' s monologue shifts backwards only about one hundred times (Cowan 10). Quentin's motive for killing himself is to escape or transcend time, and it is the day of Quentin's suicide - not necessarily the event of the suicide - in which Quentin has liberated himself, in part, from time as he has barred his future, removing his anguish in light of infinite possibilities. As William Sowder suggests, "Phenomenally, on this day, time was for Quentin not an encum- brance, as critics have maintained, but a mode of freedom" ("Quentin Compson and the Phenomenology of Time" 91). 79</page><page sequence="4">Temporality, according to Sartre, requires human consciousness in order to exist: "Temporality must have the structure of selfness. Indeed it is only because the self in its being is there outside itself that it can be before or after itself, that there can be in general any before and after. Temporality exists only as the intra- structure of a being which has to be its own being; that is, as the intra-structure of a For-itself' (195). Existentially time cannot exist without man's ability to distinguish between past, present, and future. Time is like a by-product of man's consciousness. Therefore, when I refer to Quentin's desire to escape time I am referencing time as an intra-structure of the For-itself. Quentin tries so hard to convince himself that his future is barred that when he tries to express a future, he uses a disoriented mix of verbs in the future tense (Lowrey 58). At no point in his monologue does Quentin express a hesitation to kill himself. He prepares a note and expresses satisfaction in his own upcoming inexistence: "A quarter hour yet. And then Г 11 not be. The peacefulest words. Peacefulest words. Non fui. Sum. Fui. Non Sum." (174). Quentin's suicide, in his mind, is an almost complete inevitability. He has almost completely barred his future, but as we see in Quentin's narrative, the past has swallowed up Quentin's consciousness in the present. His thoughts frequently and neurotically reflect back upon the events surrounding his sister Caddie's loss of her virginity. Quentin's desire to escape temporality is expressed through his endeavor to forget mechanical time, that is, enumerated time. Time is Quentin's burden and due to the altercations of the past involving his sister he is thus tormented. He cannot come to terms with his incestuous feelings for his sister or with the loss of her virginity. Again and again we see Quentin reminded of time through his frequent observation of shadows, calling to mind the line "life's but a walking shadow" from Macbeth. The shadow signifies Quentin's death. The word shad- ow appears four times in a short passage when Quentin is at the bridge where he eventually drowns himself: "The shadow of the bridge, the tiers of the railing, my shadow leaning flat upon the water . . . the shadow of the package like two shoes wrapped up lying on the water. Niggers say a drowned man's shadow was watching for him in the water all the time" (90). The position of the sun in the sky always haunts Quentin, reminding him of the impotence of avoiding time. The opening lines of the narrative are quite significant in that the stream of con- sciousness monologue immediately opens with an observation of the shadow of a sash on the curtains to his window and a mention of his grandfather's watch which carries with it a nihilistic association passed down from his father - the advice his father gave him upon giving Quentin the watch: When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and eight oclock and then I was in time again, hearing the watch. It was Grandfather's and when Father gave it to me he said I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it's rather excruciating-ly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experi- 80</page><page sequence="5">enee which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father's. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. (76) It seems most likely that Quentin is just waking up, as to be out of time as op- posed to in time and not dead must mean that Quentin was asleep. The sash im- mediately reminds Quentin of the temporal restriction of his own existence. In the next paragraph he conceals the watch face but is still in time because of the shadow of the sash which he can't just seem to ignore. The watch carries with it the advice from Quentin' s father, who refers to it paradoxically as a "mausole- um of all hope and desire." One would not expect hope to be in a mausoleum. There can be no hope or victory in an absurd world. Hope is the antithetic trait of the Absurd man. The watch is meant to remind Quentin of the world's ab- surdity and uselessness of searching for meaning. The best man can do is expe- rience and that is it. There are no philosophical conclusions to be drawn - none that have merit or proper foundation. In a sense, as soon as humanity discerns time into past, present and future, as through a watch, humanity is forced into the realm of possibility and our own being is nihilated. Once a future is per- ceived then existential anguish must necessarily occur due to the instinctual fear of our own possibilities. The watch then signifies the brokenness of our being - the mausoleum of hope and desire - the lack of the pour-soi. All desire and hope and any belief are constituted as a lack. The watch signifies to Quentin the emp- tiness of his being and the continual haunting of his past, although ironically Quentin was given this watch in order to forget time now and again. The watch also signifies man's desire to conquer time - as an impotent enumerated grasp at the instant - at the Present: "I began to wonder what time it was. Father said that constant speculation regarding the position of mechanical hands on an arbitrary dial which is a symptom of mind-function. Excrement Father said like sweating" (77). According to Sartre, the present is only present as a negation: "It is impos- sible to grasp the present in the form of an instant, for the instant would be the moment when the present is. But the present is not; it makes itself present in the form of flight" ( Being and Nothingness 179). Quentin's watch signifies the unachievable present as well. The watch is an Absurd reminder. Quentin's de- sire to escape time represents his strive for the en-soi-pour-soi synthetic contra- diction Sartre calls God. Quentin's mentally handicapped brother, Benjy, whose section comes right before Quentin's, is the only stream of consciousness narrative Faulkner ever gives his reader which can be appropriated as outside of time because Benjy's mind lacks the ability to distinguish past from present, and he cannot fathom a future. Benjy cannot perceive of chronological time: "Lacking any sense of se- quential time, devoid of the cognitive processes, and unable to make moral or social distinctions" ("Benjy Compson and the Field of Consciousness" 2). Para- 81</page><page sequence="6">doxically, we can infer from Sartre's Being and Nothingness that the simpler a human mind, as in a mind that is less in acute self-consciousness then the closer that being is to the en-soi - a being that simply is. But to be wholly en-soi is not to be God. God is only a hypothetically possible pour-soi-en-soi synthesis. Thus, Benjamin Compson, conscious to some degree yet having no means in which to express or comprehend mechanical time and as lacking the mental ability to question his being (as inferred by his narrative) represents Faulkner's closest to God. Benjy and Quentin' s narratives are similar in that they both switch without transition to the past as a sort of flashback. The difference is that Benjy cannot comprehend mechanical time - the watch does not signify anything. Quentin can recognize past from present from future. Benjy cannot distinguish. Benjy' s mind is on a plane of being outside of time. I would not call this phenomenological confusion since Sartre claims that temporality does not exist without man to perceive and designate it. Being outside of temporality is en-soi - a being of complete plenitude and positivity. Benjy's narrative is written as an achronolog- ical jumble. Benjy has what may be termed "memory triggers." For example, when he gets his clothes caught on a nail he then finds himself reanimating in his mind a prior time when his clothes were caught on a nail. To Benjy, this is not perceived as memory or reflection. Memory is not distinguished as in the past. What is representative of phenomenological confusion in Benjy's mind is his distorted perception of objects and places which appear into being without established relationships to other objects. Benjy is a passive participant in reali- ty. The level of cognition we see in his mind is restricted only to immediate per- ception of the senses. He can see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. He cannot articu- late the phenomenon of pain. He cries frequently yet never understanding why he cries, although he can sense the loss of Caddy, and he could sense the loss of her virginity when her scent was altered after the deed. Benjy perceives the world as moving pictures where an object appears before him or leaves him. The motive or will that gives each object motion, such a spoon being placed into his mouth by someone's hand, is never brought into consideration or understanding. Benjy cannot comprehend causal relationships except in rare circumstances.6 The spoon is only a spoon that goes in and out of his mouth regardless of the hand. The hand is not perceived as the propulsion by which the spoon enters his mouth. Benjy has no sense of his place in the world. As Sowder observes, "space delivers the world from chaos. . . . Benjy . . . had as much difficulty fo- cusing properly as he did hearing properly. For him vision was monocular, fig- ure detached from ground. In this two-dimensional world, images floated vague- ly in front of things, having no 'real place' in the world" ("Benjy Compson and the Field of Consciousness" 1 1). Rooms fall away from him, as if he were the standing object. Benjy has no perception of spatial relations. Trees can be on top 82</page><page sequence="7">of sky, and fire can be in mirrors, and shadows can be on grass. Spatial bounda- ries do not exist in Benjy's world which is why Benjy had difficulty doing some of the simplest of tasks, such as walking. Benjy was "baffled by space" (12). Space gives the world distinction and keeps a conscious individual at a distance from other objects or people. Benjy cannot conceive of this distance - he is amongst objects and akin to them in this manner. As Sowder identifies, "Benjy cannot even comprehend himself as a being in the world among objects. When Benjy looks in a mirror, he does not identify himself as what he is looking at. Benjy's reflected image is just another one of the objects flying in front of his field of vision - undistinguished and signifying nothing" (12-13). Nevertheless, this lack of identity and lack of a concept of space does not equate to a world of chaos. What instills chaos and horror in Benjy's mind is going against conven- tion and routine, as we see in the powerful and dramatic ending to The Sound and the Fury. Even a mind devoid of spatial understanding can establish stabil- ity and routine. As one critic points out, "Despite the prevailing mood of barely eased agony in the first section, Benjy has managed to stabilize his world. His terrible muteness - although it prevents a nameable knowledge of his loss - paradoxically blesses Benjy with serenity" (Matthews 86). For this reason I think we should, as Faulkner suggests, exclude feeling pity for Benjy since he may indeed be endowed with serenity as a result of his idiocy. Benjy cannot reason in any mediocre capacity, and he is only capable of having "thought" in the loosest sense of the term, but these insights are always restricted to reflection and observation. Benjy is memory without reason. It is generally recognized by critics7 that Benjy does not show any form of intellectu- al growth beyond childhood; however, scholar Ted Roggenbuck points out that just because Benjy's mind does not progress intellectually, does not mean his mind remains unchanged by his experiences (581). Benjy's inability to reason is indicated by the absence of the hypothetic in his monologue. Never once does the word "if' or "because" appear aside from in the dialogue of others in his stream of consciousness narrative which means he cannot form any conditionals nor establish relationships. Benjy cannot offer any theories or conclusions. Even his articulation for objects and action is extremely simple. There are few adverbs that he expresses in his narrative to provide any depth to any action. There are few adjectives to give depth to his surroundings. Benjy's world is simple and reasonless. The following passage is typical of Benjy's monologue, as he simply records what he sees and experiences in very little detail: Caddy and I ran. We ran up the kitchen steps, onto the porch, and Cad- dy knelt down in the dark and held me. I could hear her and feel her chest. 'I wont.' she said. 'I wont anymore, ever. Benjy. Benjy.' Then she was crying, and I cried, and we held each other. 'Hush.' she said. 'Hush. I wont anymore.' So I hushed and Caddy got up and we went into the kitchen and turned the light on and Caddy took the kitchen 83</page><page sequence="8">soap and washed her mouth at the sink, hard. Caddy smelled like trees. (48) All verbs, aside from Caddie's dialogue, are in the past tense. The only adjective to provide depth to the scene is with "kitchen soap." The only adverb is used irregularly: "washed her mouth at the sink, hard." Although one could speculate that the "so" in "So I hushed" could operate as a "therefore," it seems more plausible it's utilized as a conjunction like "and" given Benjy's general habit of describing events using simple conjunctions to compile clauses. Faulkner seems to suggest through the simplicity of Benjy's vocabulary and descriptions that Benjy's perception of the world lacks depth. We cannot say even that Benjy has free will because he never uses the fu- ture tense. The word "could" appears in a few places, as the first line of his nar- rative, in fact, but the word is not used to indicate purpose: "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them him hitting" (3). In this in- stance could is utilized to express past ability rather than possibility. "Could see" can just as well be "saw." The absence of purpose clauses indicates that Benjy lacks intention. If there is no perception of a future, of one's impact on the future, then there can be no choice. Benjy has no past or future. He is outside of the temporal dimension of the pour-soi. Benjy simply is. Yet reason alone is not what constitutes consciousness unless we mendaciously wish to posit that all non-human living beings are unconscious, and it would be even more arrogant to say that Benjy's reality is of a lower order than cognizant humanity. Benjy's perspective on the world is just as valid as that of an ant or bird or ape or cogni- zant human when viewed within Benjy's own personal context. Benjy is not conscious of being conscious, but he is conscious. He perceives, although he is not self-aware. His body interacts without his own motive in mind, as if it were simply an extension of the outside world (Kinney 148-49). Therefore, he most certainly is not pour-soi. Nor can he be en-soi because he is a conscious being and not an object. Faulkner claimed that "You can't feel anything for Benjy be- cause he can't feel anything. . . . Benjy wasn't rational enough even to be self- ish. He was an animal" (Meriwether and Milgate 245-46). If Benjy isn't even rational enough to be selfish then the absence of Caddy in his life is not a true absence, unlike Quentin, because in Benjy's mind the memory trigger objects signifying Caddy on April Seventh, 1928 completely resurrect the experience of Benjy and Caddy together time and time again (Matthews 86). It isn't longing nostalgia. Memory really is to Benjy. Nor in this same sense can Benjy ever possess anguish for the future - an underlying fear of his possibilities at the root of self-consciousness. Benjy has thought - reflection and observation without cognition. He has no sense of identity because he is never conscious of being conscious. One must imagine Benjy serene as a whole - unanguished and blessed with idiocy. Benjy is Faulkner's closest literary equivalent to a synthetic en-soi-pour-soi contradiction. Benjy is therefore Faulkner's closest to God. 84</page><page sequence="9">Notes 1 Translator Hazel Barnes defines Being-In-Itself succinctly in his glossary to Being and Nothingness as "Non-conscious Being. It is the Being of the phe- nomenon and overflows the knowledge which we have of it. It is a plenitude, and strictly speaking we can say of it only that it is" (800). Sartre tell us in relation to the in-itself that "transition, becoming, anything which permits us to say that being is not yet what it will be and that it is already what it is not - all that is forbidden on principle. For being is the being of be- coming and due to this fact it is beyond becoming. It is what it is. This means that by itself it can not even be what it is not; we have seen indeed that it can encompass no negation. It is full positivity" {Being and Nothingness 29). "From this point of view we shall see later that it [Being-in-Itself] is not subject to temporality. It is, and when it gives way, one can not even say that it no longer is. Or, at least, a consciousness can be conscious of it as no longer being, precisely because consciousness is temporal. But being itself does not exist as a lack there where it was; the full positivity of being is re-formed on its giving way. It was and at present other beings are: that is all" Being and Noth- ingness 29. translator Hazel Barnes defines Being-For-Itself succinctly in his glossary to Being and Nothingness as "The nihilation of Being-in-itself; consciousness conceived as a lack of Being, a desire for Being, a relation to Being. By bringing Nothingness into the world the For-itself can stand out from Being and judge other beings by knowing what it is not. Each For-itself is the nihilation of a par- ticular being" (800). Interestingly, Sartre's discussion of temporality in Being and Nothingness utilizes the word haunt often in reference to the past in relation to the human being: "the Past is not immanent in the For-itself. It haunts the For-itself at the moment that the For-itself acknowledges itself as not being this or that particular thing" (200). Critic Ted Roggenbuck cites an instance where Benjy notes that Quentin tried to catch Versh but "couldn't." This must indicate Benjy could establish the hypothetical catching of Versh by Quentin, that is, if Quentin jumped at Versh with his arms then Quentin would catch Versh. This I consider the rare peeking in of reason in Benjy's mind, as the overwhelming majority of Benjy's mono- logue indicates the absence of hypotheticals and possibilities ("The way he looked said Hush": Benjy's Mental Atrophy in "The Sound and the Fury"). 7Critic Moffitt Cecil states that "Benjy lacks the powers that would enable him to think." 41.
