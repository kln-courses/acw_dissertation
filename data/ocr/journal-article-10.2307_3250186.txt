<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND POLITICS AT THE MONGOL COURT OF CHINA: TUGH TEMUR'S COLLECTION OF CHINESE PAINTINGS n the long history of Chinese imperial art collecting, the short reign (1328-1332) of Emperor Tugh Temiir of the Yuan dynasty figures as a remarkable episode. Guided by a small group of trusted officials, this Mongolian emperor, known also by his posthumous name, Wenzong, employed antique Chinese paintings in the direct service of court policy. The ingenuity of their method lay in the use of the collections as more than an accumulation of treasures; instead, the officials singled out specific, individual images through which they could expound a political message. Following imperial orders, the scholars wrote down new readings and affixed them to the scrolls, thus disseminating and pre- serving an imperial vision of the political utility of art. By the Yuan period, imperial art collecting had been practiced for over a thousand years. Zhang Yanyuan (fl. ca. 815-ca. 875), the great art historian of the Tang dynasty, traced the tradition to Emperor Wu (I57-87 BCE) of the Han dynasty.' From the Period of Division and through the Tang, the accumulation of cultural artifacts was a prerogative of the emperor; in fact, by the Song it had become a necessary sign of a ruler's legitimacy. The collection's symbolic power resided in its ency- clopedic composition, in its aura of a universe brought under the control of a central authority. Indeed, the ownership of"all under heaven" (tianxia zhi wu) was essential to the emperor's ability to main- tain the balance and order of the terrestrial realm. Imperial collecting thus strongly favored the accumulation of large numbers of artworks and pre- cious objects. Both neighboring rulers and individual Chinese subjects usually acknowledged the emperor's right to their treasures by offering them to the throne, sometimes voluntarily and some- times in response to an official edict. Works deliberately hidden from the emperor's reach were sub- ject to confiscation, as the famous incident of Taizong's deception and theft of Wang Xizhi's Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering demonstrates. Taizong's motivations in this affair arose from an essen- tial feature of his calligraphy collection: its authority resided in its completeness and authenticity. Even though Taizong owned over two thousand other works by Wang,2 without the famed Preface, the cat- egory of "writings by Wang Xizhi" would have remained imperfect. I Zhang Yanyuan, Lidai minghua ji, in Huashi congshu, vol. I, comp. Yu Anlan (Shanghai: Renmin meishu chubanshe, 1962), I.3. Zhang's calculations notwithstanding, modern studies locate the genesis of art collecting still earlier, in the sacred, cosmological, and talismanic collections of bronzes, jades, and maps owned by mythical emperors of pre- history, as well as Shang (ca. I6oo-ca. Ioo05 BCE) and Western Zhou (ca. Io050o-77I BCE) kings.

Xuanhe huapu, the Song-dynasty imperial catalog, consists of biographies of painters followed by lists of paintings owned by the emperor. In the Southern Song, the catalogs of the imperial collections were organized in long lists according to painting formats (hanging scroll, hand scroll, etc.). Occasionally Huizong or Gaozong inscribed the painting's title on the scroll or added a cipher to record its presence in the collection; however, I have found no records of poems or inscriptions written for these paintings by members of the Song court. The mid-Yuan system of officials writing and recording poem cycles for specific paint- ings in the emperor's possession was largely a new phenomenon. I believe that the creative treatment of the imperial collections can be related to an emerging pol- itics of identity during this period of foreign rule in China. In recent years, scholars of Chinese history have begun to question the long-standing anti-Mongol view of the Yuan and have developed a more positive assessment of Yuan culture as a dynamic, multiethnic phenomenon. In this new view, indi- vidual or group identity in the Yuan was fluid and could be shaped through the concatenation, jux- taposition, or assimilation of cultural behaviors and emblems sometimes believed to be immiscible. The crafting of a Sino-Mongolian identity for Tugh Temiir was a major occupation of his inner court, and the scholars' presentation and interpretation of antique Chinese paintings served the purposes of this identity politics. From a sinocentric historical viewpoint, Tugh Temiir's penchant for traditional Chinese art has been identified as a triumph of Mongolian assimilation to the Han Chinese culture. His reign has been described as a watershed in the Mongol occupation of China, a period in which the Yuan dynasty as a discrete regional, political, and administrative unit became autonomous from the influence of " Greater Mongolia. "3 To substantiate this view, John Langlois has pointed to the strongly Confucian rhetoric of Tugh Temiir's court and the adoption of Chinese elite behaviors, such as art collecting.4 More recently, the historian Hsiao Ch'i-ch'ing has argued for a more complex reading of this period, taking into account the broad multiethnic character of its polity. He points out that Tugh Temiir took care to appease the Mongol princes and to maintain peaceful relations with neighboring khanates.5 Indeed, when we consider the imperial image under construction by his officials, we discover that they pro- moted - and the emperor encouraged - a vision of the "Son of Heaven's" amicable familial and polit- ical relations with the many rulers whose territories spanned Central Asia. The emperor's ties to Greater Mongolia meant that selected emblems of Mongolian power would be woven into his otherwise Con- fucian mantle. 3 John Dardess, Conquerors and Conf cians: Aspects of Political Change in Late Yuan China (New York: Columbia Uni- versity Press, I973), 20. 4 John D.

Several scholarly studies of the Kuizhangge provide us with a rich picture of its history and organization; research by Chiang I-han, Fu Shen, Marsha Weidner [Haufler], and Kanda Kiichiro has resulted in the partial recon- struction of the art collection stored there.6 These researchers' inventories consist of both surviving artworks bearing Tugh Temiir's seals and/or inscriptions by Kuizhangge personnel, as well as paint- ings associated with the Kuizhangge only in textual sources. Poetic inscriptions for particular paint- ings in his collection appear in Yuan collectanea (wenji) under titles that explicitly state that they were written at Tugh Temiir's command (yingzhi). These surviving poems contain rich iconographic read- ings of the paintings and point to the essential functions of collecting and "enjoying" art at Tugh Temiur's court; however, no extended analysis of the paintings or inscriptions has been published. This article aims to fill that gap. Art historians have generally taken a somewhat narrow view of the Kuizhangge, seeing it simply as a center for the promotion of Chinese art and culture at the Mongol court. In recent literature, the Kuizhangge has been depicted as a latter-day equivalent of Song Emperor Huizong's (I082-II35) famous art studio and library, the Xuanhedian.7 Indeed, allusions to Emperor Huizong and his art pep- per the documentary history of the Kuizhangge, and the fourteenth-century scholars intentionally invoked Huizong as an imperial model in order to position the viewing of paintings as a leisure activ- ity, a diversion from the more serious business of collating thejingshi dadian, an 880-volume tome documenting the administrative acts of the previous Yuan emperors.8 Nonetheless, these same scholars functioned in an environment of political instability. Mid-Yuan court politics were plagued with factional tensions between groups of bureaucrats (of all ethnicities - Chinese, Mongolian, and various Central Asian groups), "usually in alliance with groups of imperial [Mongol] princes. "9 During Tugh Temiir's reign, two senior officials, the Qipchaq El Temtir (d. I333) and his ally Bayan of the Merkid tribe (d. 1340), deftly manipulated the frictions between the various groups, thereby weakening the factions' power and increasing their own dominance. By arrogating most of the power in their own hands, the two turned Tugh Temiir into a figurehead, an imperial sym- 6 Kanda Kiichiro, "Gen no Bunso no furyu ni tsuite," in Haneda Hokushi shoju kinen toyoyshi ronso (Kyoto: Toyoshi Ken- kyukai, 1950), 484-488; Fu Shen, Yuandi huangshi shuhua shoucang shiluze (Taipei: Guoli Gugong bowuyuan, 1982), 52-6I; Chiang I-han, Yuandai Kuizhangge ji Kuizhang renwu (Taipei: Lianjing chuban shiye gongsi, 1981), especially chaps.

In what follows, I will demonstrate that the presentation of antique Chinese paintings at Tugh Temiir's library, far from being a simple "form of relaxation"" and entertainment for this Yuan ruler, was deeply allied with larger rhetorical concerns of Tugh Temiir's court. The appointed scholars, through their selection and interpretation of particular paintings, made the Chinese past serve a Mon- gol sovereign's present in novel ways. Their articulation of the ruler's ethnic and ideological identi- ties through the mirror of the Chinese past also exhibits the self-consciously poly-ethnic character of mid-Yuan court culture and politics. THE IMPERIAL "RESTORATION" OF 1328 The coup d'etat and civil war that brought Tugh Temtir to the throne in 1328 had a direct bearing on the construction and development of his imperial persona.12 The seeds of the conflict originated in the 1307 succession struggle between Khubilai Khan's (Shizu, r. I260-1I294) two great-grandsons, Khaishan (Wuzong, r. I307-I31I, Tugh Temiir's father) and Ayurbarwada (Renzong, r. 1311-1320, his uncle). The ultimate selection of Khaishan, "a military hero from the steppes ... [who] behaved like a nomadic chieftain,"13 came with the proviso that his younger brother, Ayurbarwada, be designated heir appar- ent. Thus, upon the death of Khaishan in 1311, Ayurbarwada peaceably ascended the throne. The agree- ment of I307, however, had not clearly specified the line of succession after Ayurbarwada, and soon several contenders and their supporters began maneuvering for position. For the next twelve years Ayurbarwada and his descendents ruled the country, and they success- fully removed Khaishan's sons - Khoshila (Mingzong, r. I329) and his younger brother Tugh Temtir - from the political scene by banishing them to distant corners of the empire. In 1316, Khoshila was exiled to the southwestern hinterlands in Yunnan Province; however, he managed to escape to the northern steppe where he lived as a political refugee at the court of the Chaghatai Khanate. Five years later, the reigning emperor sent Tugh Temiir to Hainan, a subtropical island off the southern coast of China. From these remote outposts, they witnessed the murder of Ayurbarwada's son (Shidebala, Yingzong, r. 132I-I323) by a disgruntled group of Central Asian aristocrats and Mongol princes. His successor, Yesun Temiir (r. 1323-1328) attempted to appease his imperial relatives by bestowing gifts and land. He also recalled Tugh Temtir from Hainan. Io Ibid., 54I-556.

Tugh Temtir's group included a range of individuals with their particular axes to grind, but the leaders were the Central Asian bureaucrats El Temiir and Bayan, who had served Khaishan and remained loyal to his descendants. In 1324, Tugh Temiir improved his standing considerably by mar- rying his cousin, the daughter of Princess Sengge Ragi. His aunt - and new mother-in-law - was the sibling of two emperors, Khaishan and Ayurbarwada, and the aunt of a third, Shidebala. Not only did she wield significant political clout within the imperial family, but she also maintained well-estab- lished patron-client relationships with a number of high-ranking Chinese bureaucrats.14 Not surpris- ingly, her son-in-law soon found himself living in his own palace in present-day Nanjing with a royal title: Prince of Huai. In 1328, Yesun Temiir died, and El Temiir staged the coup that successfully installed Tugh Temuir on the throne. This audacious move touched off a short, but bitter, civil war that effectively consoli- dated E1l Temtir's power.15 As E1l Temuir's puppet, Tugh Temiir "controlled" the seals of the imperial office; however, his older brother, Khoshila, still held a competing claim to the throne. Seeking to avoid a direct confrontation with Khoshila, Tugh Temiir abdicated in his brother's favor in the sec- ond month of I329, an act that later served as an example of Tugh Temiir's Confucian piety. Six months later, in the eighth month of I329, the two long-estranged brothers met in Inner Mon- golia and held a great banquet to celebrate the occasion. Four days later, Khoshila was dead. The official annals cite unnatural events as the cause of his demise, and most historians have presumed that El Temiir poisoned him. For his part, Tugh Temiir wasted no time in ascending the throne once more, and his sponsors (El Temiir and Bayan) never bothered to call the traditional assembly of Mongol princes (khuriltai) to decide the rightful succession.16 El Temiir's military successes had made this fun- damental Mongolian institution obsolete. Tugh Temiir's climb to the throne over his brother's dead body and without princely sanction was untenable in both the Chinese Confucian tradition of statecraft and in the Mongolian military-polit- ical order.17 Power struggles plagued his reign; his supporters uncovered eight plots on his life led by rival factions in the imperial family. Langlois contends that Tugh Temiir's urgent need of the "veneer of legitimacy" was answered by El Temiir's creation of an ambitious campaign to endow Tugh Temuir with a new persona: enlightened Confucian sage ruler.18 This choice was almost inevitable, since not only had El Temiir thrown in his lot with a large "Confucian" bureaucratic faction in order to win its support for the coup, but Tugh Temiir's own residence in southern China had instilled in him Chi- 14 See Shen C.

The use of Confucian values by the "restoration" faction both elicited the continued support of the bureaucracy and provided Tugh Temiir's court with useful symbolic tools. For instance, in a series of memorials his officials drew attention to his earlier abdication in Khoshila's favor as proof of his familial loyalty and brotherly humility.19 In studying these texts, Langlois argues that the invocation of Confucian vocabulary and institutions at Tugh Temiir's court was largely propaganda designed to legitimate the emperor's authority.20 Respecting Langlois's conclusion, I would argue as well that the legitimacy campaign was not waged on a Confucianist front alone; instead, an appeal was also made to other constituencies through references to several potent systems of figuration, including Tibetan Buddhist and Daoist symbology. For instance, a joint portrait of the two brothers appears in the lower left corner of a large Tibetan- style Buddhist mandala produced for Tugh Temiir after Khoshila's death (fig. I). Dressed in Mongo- lian attire, the two sit in complete harmony with each other and with the pantheon of Buddhist deities (fig. 2). Far from portraying them as antagonists, this emphatically Mongolian religious work promotes the same vision of brotherly love and respect enunciated in so many of Tugh Temiir's overtly Confu- cian memorials. Used in imperial religious rituals, the audience for this mandala would have been members of the royal family and their allies. Clearly the central court used several vehicles to commu- nicate to different audiences in different settings the specious claim of Tugh Temiir's rightful succes- sion. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNCTION OF THE KUIZHANGGE Tugh Temiir created the Kuizhangge shortly after his abdication in favor of Khoshila in early 1329, ostensibly as part of his "private" administration.21 Fu Shen has suggested that the Kuizhangge func- To serve him in the Kuizhangge, Tugh Temiir appointed such Chinese luminaries as YuJi (1271-1348), Jie Xisi (1274-1344), Ouyang Xuan (I283-1357), and Su Tianjue (1294-1352), as well as prominent members of the educated Central Asian elite, including the famed Uighur calligrapher Kangli Naonao (d. 1345), the Onggiid statesman Zhao Shiyan (I260-I336), and the exceptional translator Khutulugh Tormish (dates unknown). Ceremonial posts went to imperial relatives like Sandi,23 and nominal joint appointments were given to the very highest officials, including El Temiir and Bayan. According to Hsiao Ch'i-ch'ing, the Kuizhangge official roster "represented the largest concentration of scholarly and artistic talents from all ethnic groups [serving] together in a single governmental body in the Yuan dynasty.

He goes on to note that the concentration of talent in a single government bureau was "unprecedented not only in the Yuan dynasty but also in Chinese history." 248</page><page sequence="7">The major activities of the Kuizhangge personnel were the study, transmission, and translation of texts.2s A series of official memorials and edicts document the importance of these functions; for instance, Tugh Temur's edict of I330 emphasizes the educational role that Kuizhangge scholars played: Since Our ancient ancestors knew only the life of want [on the steppe], how could they have a gen- eral understanding of administering the rule of the country? Therefore, We established the Kuizhangge and appointed scholars to advise Us about Our predecessors and about the periods of good government and of chaos in ancient times. We ordered them to approach and explain the attainment and loss [of the Mandate of Heaven] and to give Us pleasure in the hearing [of these matters]. Noble scholars, contribute to the best of your ability your knowledge of these matters and do not shirk from your responsibility [for fear of reproach] .26 [Chinese Text A, see page 276] Yu Ji, a major figure in the Kuizhangge, elaborated on the emperor's edict, announcing that the Kuizhangge scholars should: provide explanations about the learns a nd the ways of kings, the reasons for pros- perity and failure, for attainment and loss, so that [these things] could serve as admonishments [for the emperor] .27 [Text B ] The Kuizhangge scholars churned out reams of Confucian materials - edicts written on behalf of the emperor, memorials, translations, records, and poems - designed in large part to convince the bureau- cracy of the legitimacy of the imperial succession.28 To disseminate the carefully constructed imperial image, the Kuizhangge hired stone carvers to engrave the most important documents on steles; for instance, officials snatched up ink rubbings of Yu Ji's laudatory "Record of the Kuizhangge, " said to be written out by Tugh Temiir himself.29 The recipients of the officially printed Kuizhangge "propaganda" consisted of members of the court, as well as the greater bureaucracy. In a number of public documents circulating during and after Tugh Temiir's reign, Chinese officials represented the emperor's cultural leanings as a sign of his sage admin- istration.30 Unofficial rumors about the emperor's activities in the Kuizhangge also spread the desired representation of Tugh Temiir as a morally righteous ruler.31 25 Song, Yuanshi, 88.229; Weidner [Haufler], "Painting and Patronage at the Mongol Court," 21. 26 Song, Yuanshi, 34.7I51; quoted in Chiang, Yuandai Kuizhangge, 40. 27 Chiang, YZuandai Kuizhangge, 37-38. 28 See Langlois, "Yii Chi and His Mongol Sovereign." 29 Yu, Daoyuan xuegu lu, Io.24b-25a; and Su Tianjue, Zixi wengao, 28.14. 30 See, for instance, Yu i's mention of Tugh Temiir 's painting viewings on a stele marking the tomb of a high official in Yu, Daoyuan xuegu lu, I7.6. Kathlyn Liscomb has studied a similar use of commemorative works (especially paint- ing-poem collaborations) in both official and private spheres during the Ming dynasty; see "Foregrounding the Sym- biosis of Power: A Rhetorical Strategy in Some Chinese Commemorative Art," Art History 25, 2 (April 2002): 135-I61. 3I Tao Zongyi, Zhuogeng lu, 7.I6b. 249</page><page sequence="8">The major figure responsible for the care of collections and the handling of imperial painting view- ings in the Kuizhangge was Ke Jiusi (I290-I343), who concerned himself almost exclusively with inspecting paintings and calligraphy as wellgraphy as discussing individual scrolls with his sovereign. Appointed to the newly created position of Master Connoisseur of Calligraphy (jianshu boshi) in I330, Ke served Tugh Temiir with undeterred devotion.32 Tugh Temiir returned the favor by bestowing art- works upon Ke and elevating his official rank.33 Ke probably spent much of his time in the storehouse for paintings and calligraphies - the Inner Office of Assembled Jades (qunyu neisi), a subsidiary admin- istrative unit located within the Kuizhangge's courtyard. The theme of Tugh Temiir surrounded by his assembled worthies admiring famous paintings from the storehouse recurs in several Yuan-dynasty poems and essays. For instance, Tao Zongyi (ca. I3I6-I402) tells us: [During] the days when Wenzong [Tugh Temiir] presided in the Kuizhang[ge], Academician YuJi and Connoisseur KeJiusi were in frequent attendance. They devoted themselves to the dis- cussion of calligraphy and painting.34 [Text C Ke Jiusi, in his series Fifteen Palace Poems, paints the scene in an even more radiant light: The Four Seas are at peace, there is not [even] one matter [of concern]; The daily audience has ended, and [His Majesty] assembles the sundry scholars. The order to bring the famous paintings is sent to the Inner Office of Assembled Jades; The first work presented is the Tang-dynasty painting "Admonishing the Emperor."35 [Text D] Presumably, the emperor presided over his "art court " by having his officials bring enlightening paint- ings and comment on the contents as they were unrolled. In this context, Ke's choice of a Tang-dynasty painting depicting court officials admonishing the emperor was not coincidental; assuming that the Kuizhangge scholars did in fact present a painting of this subject, they ostensibly hoped to provide Tugh Temiir with a model for the appropriate Chinese relationship between the ruler and his minis- 32 Yang Yu, Shanju xinhua, 23; quoted in Chiang, Yuandai Kuizhangge, 155. Chiang argues that this position and bureau were created especially and specifically for Ke Jiusi (as a promotion from rank 7 to rank ) owing to Tugh Temiir 's great fondness for Ke. 33 Ke Jiusi presented Wang Xizhi's Cao E bei to Tugh Temiir, who in turn bestowed it back to Ke Jiusi in appreciation of his " fine connoisseurial discernment " ("shang shanJiusi jianbian "); see Kanda, " Gen no Bunso no furyu, " 484, quot- ing from YuJi's inscription on the bei. 34 Tao Zongyi, Zhuogeng lu, 7.J6; translation from Francis Woodman Cleaves, "The 'Fifteen 'Palace Poems" by KeJiusi, HarvardJournal of Asiatic Studies 20, 3/4 (December I957): 400. 35 The poem series first appeared in print in Wang Feng, Wuxiji (Wenyuange siku quanshu edition) (Taipei: National Palace Museum, 1981), 5.I3.

But more importantly, Ke's citation of this particular title in a poem series intended to circulate widely among members of the court served to disseminate an image of Tugh Temiir as a ruler respect- ful of Chinese tradition, and the Kuizhangge scholars as more than self-serving minions. The poem, in effect, transformed the purported painting viewing into a tool of the Kuizhangge's public relations agenda, providing both Tugh Temiir and his close advisors with a veil of ideological correctness. The vigilant Kuizhangge officials also sought to avoid the impression that these imperial pleas- ures were merely superficial trivialities (a major criticism of Emperor Huizong's passion for the arts) by presenting paintings that contained easily apprehended political allegories or metaphors. While most of these metaphors served to bolster Tugh Temiir's pose as a Chinese sage-ruler, on closer inspec- tion, some emblems have distinctly Mongolian connotations. As we turn to the paintings and the poems written for them by Kuizhangge officials, we will see that the political hermeneutics of art largely dictated the artistic activities at Tugh Temiir's court. READING AND RE-READING TUGH TEMUR'S COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS We need only sample a few inscriptions from Kuizhangge scholars to apprehend the general mood of the painting viewing sessions. In most cases, the painting became a vehicle for expressing admiration of Tugh Temiir's sagacious rule, or alternatively for providing him with a short lesson in Chinese his- tory or statecraft. Other paintings inspired discursions into geopolitics or ethnicity. Certain subjects - most notably imperial portraits, horse images, genre scenes, and religious paintings - commended themselves more readily to the Kuizhangge's political aims. Moreover, in a significant break from the typical colophon-poem, the scholars consistently avoided traditional topics such as artistic style, authorship, and provenance.36 An especially notable textual strategy was the linking of a series of poems, mimicking the trajectory of a conversation and suggesting a certain performative formality. Imperial Models: Tang Xuanzong and Song Huizong The Kuizhangge scholars frequently presented images of and by former Chinese emperors. Their favorite models, Emperor Xuanzong (r. 7I2-756) of the Tang and Emperor Huizong of the Song, had both presided over courts of great literary and cultural brilliance. However, both Xuanzong and Huizong had also fallen victim to devastating military insurrections that had crippled their dynasties. Therefore, the choice of these two imperial predecessors as models for Tugh Temiir would seem an indiscriminate error were it not for the ingenious readings given the paintings by Kuizhangge schol- ars. 36 An earlier precedent for this inscriptional style can be found in colophons composed for paintings in Sengge Ragi's collection. In her study of the princess's I323 "scholars' elegant gathering," Chen Yunru argues that the traditional connoisseurial language had been abandoned in favor of rich descriptions of the paintings' content. See Chen Yunru, "Meng-Yuan huangshi de shuhua yishu fengshang yu shoucang," in Dahan de shijie: Meng-Yuan shidai de duo Yuan wenhua yu yishuz (Age of the Great Khan: Pluralism in Chinese Art and Culture under the Mongols) (Taipei: National Palace Museum, 200I), 274-278. 25I</page><page sequence="10">Poems written at imperial command by both Jie Xisi and Yu Ji for a painting entitled Tang Minghuazng [Xuanzong] on an Outing (Tang Minghuang chuyou tu) employ clever interpretive strate- gies. Paintings of this subject survive in a number of recensions, but none is conclusively connected to the painting seen in the Kuizhangge. Figure 3 reproduces an example from the Liaoning Provincial Museum.37 In a poem written for Tugh Temiir on a copy of the painting by Zhou Yi,38 Yu Ji writes: Who painted [this image] of the great events in the Kaiyuan period? Handsome youths and pretty girls [accompany] the emperor on his heavenly steed. Officials follow on horseback and on foot, each holding [insignia]. Off they go to Huaqing Springs with thoughts of relaxing.39 The palace flowers are like tapestries brightening the verdant spring, His Highness [Tugh Temiir] allows himself to turn away and think of the ancients. Unconsciously, he is bodily transported to the Land of Bliss,40 And personally offers his respect to the inhabitant of the Zichen Hall [i.e. Xuanzong].41 [Text E [Text E] Jie Xisi follows with: Minghuang's [Xuanzong's] eight steeds race up the imperial highway; Is it still the Kaiyuan reign period (713-742), or already Tianbao (742-756)? Chang'an's flowers sprout from ten-thousand-year-old branches,42 Not noticing their aging amidst the drunken splendor. In the Kuizhangge, undisturbed by official dispatches, The bejeweled crown decorously salutes the ancient sage kings.43 Looking at this painting is not a trivial affair, Since the rulers of antiquity act as golden mirrors.44 [Text F] 37 Another version resides in the National Palace Museum, Taipei. 38 YuJi, Daoyuan leigao, 4.ia. In Zhongguo meishujia renming cidian, Zhou Yi is identified as a Yuan-dynasty painter; how- ever, the only source of information about him comes from Yu Ji's colophon on this painting. Zhou Yi is otherwise unknown; he may have been a palace copyist. 39 A historical imperial retreat, the Huaqing Hot Springs Resort, on the outskirts of Chang'an, was the site of Xuan- zong's elegant parties. 40 The text reads "Yingzhou," which is a mythical paradise in the Eastern Sea. 4I Zichendian was the name of an imperial Tang- and Song-dynasty audience hall where the emperor received large groups of officials or envoys from other countries. The Yuan imperial city did not include a building with this name. 42 "Ten-thousand-year-old branches" is an allusion to a poem by Xie Tiao (464-499) describing the lovely scenery around the palace (Zi, or Purple, Hall). 43 Literally, the sages of the Yu and Tang periods, namely the legendary righteous rulers Yao and Shun. 44 Jie,Jie Xisi quanji (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, I985), 443. The poem first appeared a few years later inJie's Wen'anji. 252</page><page sequence="11">Yu Ji's and Jie Xisi's interpretations of the painting assume an understanding of the historical devel- opments of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, which began with a restoration of a just and humane state after the abuses of his grandmother, the notorious Empress Wu. Xuanzong's early reign, the period referred to in the poem as the Kaiyuan, was a model of strong, activist Confucian government. However, after changing the reign title to Tianbao in 742, the aging emperor grew increasingly remote as he neg- lected the affairs of state in favor of consorting with his beloved concubine, Yang Guifei (719-756), at his resort palace at Huaqing Springs outside the capital. As Yang's influence rose, her family slowly came to dominate the government, culminating in a rebellion by her adopted "son," who declared himself emperor of a new dynasty. Although the challenge to Tang authority ultimately failed, the central court never regained its former power and glory. In their inscriptions for the painting, YuJi andJie Xisi draw upon the long Chinese tradition of reading portraits as moral exemplars of good or evil. YuJi, taking the stage first, invokes the expan- siveness and grandeur of the earlier Kaiyuan period, viewing Xuanzong's pleasure outing as a deserved respite after long periods spent on the demanding tasks of administrating the empire. Jie Xisi argues the point by placing the scene during the declining years of Xuanzong's reign, when frivolity had masked the deepening corruption and despair. While YuJi extols Xuanzong's virtues, Jie Xisi warns against Xuanzong's excesses. By presenting two contrasting interpretations, Yu andjie effectively col- laborated to use the image as an object of moral suasion for Tugh Temiir. In fact, their joint message turns on the split identity of Xuanzong's reign: imperial virtue must be vigilantly cultivated and pre- served, lest one fall prey to pride and greed. The appearance of Tugh Temiir in the second quatrain of each poem provides a metamessage transcending the fundamental admonishment presented in the first quatrains. Yu and Jie imply that their sovereign heeds the lessons of the past, thus presenting Tugh Temiir as the ultimate sage king. As noted previously, the Kuizhangge scholars also made the late-Northern Song emperor Huizong serve as an imperial model for Tugh Temiir. But rather than images of Huizong, the scholar-officials deployed images by Huizong; a number of extant paintings attributed to Huizong bear Tugh Temiir's seals, including The Five-Colored Parakeet ( Wuse yingwu tu), now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 4).45 As a painter, calligrapher, aesthete, and connoisseur, Huizong embodied a cultural sophis- tication rarely achieved, even by the "Sons of Heaven. " In his youth Tugh Temiir had also learned to paint and write calligraphy in the Chinese style, and he fancied himself a connoisseur of painting. Through the presentation of paintings by this former ruler, the scholars flattered Tugh Temuiir, sug- gesting that he possessed finely honed (Chinese) aesthetic sensibilities on a par with Huizong's. According to the Yuan-dynasty connoisseur Lu Youren (fl. 1330-I346), a painting and written record by Huizong of evening festivities in the Chengping Hall hung in the Kuizhangge.46 InJie Xisi's collected writings, we find an imperially commissioned colophon for a Huizong painting and com- 45 Several other paintings attributed to Huizong or in his style and bearing the seals of Tugh Temiir are extant; these include Golden Pheasant on Hibiscus Tree in the Palace Museum, Beijing. Two other paintings are in the National Palace Museum: Birds Gathered around Plum and Bamboo, an anonymous Song painting in the Xuanhe-period style; and Plum and Mountain Birds, attributed to Huizong. 46 Lu Youren (fl.

This colophon is the first in a series of four poems appearing under the heading "Inscriptions for four paintings in the imperial collection, [written in] response to the emperor's order." Although Jie does not specify the emperor for whom he wrote these poems, inscriptions for the same set of paint- ings appear in the collected writings of other Kuizhangge scholars.47 All of the Cais of the Eastern Capital parade along the Central Avenue, At the Chengping Hall in the Yanfu Palace, the music continues all night. A thousand acres of pine and bamboo [surround] the Jade Palace, From the sky sweep winds and mists, moistening the rainbow of garments. The ruler and ministers are on intimate terms, as in the days of Shun and Yao; The resplendence of the ceremonial music surpasses even the Han and Tang. The next day [Huizong] finished this painting and wrote a record, Bequeathing it for thousands of years to investigators of his rise and fall.48 [Text G] Jie Xisi expresses an ambivalent attitude toward Huizong, as well as toward Cai Jing (1046-Ii26), who was vilified as the author of the Song dynasty's Ii26 demise at the hands of the Jurchen invaders. Strangely, the first couplet of the second stanza lauds the close relationship between Huizong and Cai, between emperor and minister, as resembling the utopian ideals of high antiquity.49 In the next and final couplet, Jie refers to Huizong's disastrous defeat, but only in the last character of the poem (wang, or loss). The obliqueness of the last reference and the formulaic structure of the poem suggest thatJie's inscription probably fit into a longer poem series whose total effect would have explored the com- plexities of the subject matter. As with Xuanzong, the scholars' treatment ofHuizong's image was indeed equivocal. Huizong's artistic capabilities were admirable, but he repeatedly appears as an archetype of poor leadership. The Yuanshi records an audience at which the emperor5? expressed his admiration for a painting by Huizong. One day the emperor was looking at a painting by Huizong, and he said it was good. [Kangli] Naonao approached [the throne] and said, "Huizong was very capable, but there was only one thing he could not do. " The emperor asked, "What was that?" [Kangli] replied, "He just was unable to 47 Most notably in YuJi's collected writings. 48 Jie,Jie Xisi quanji, 8.230. 49 A possible explanation could be that Huizong's reliance on his chief minister, Cai Jing, served as an allegory of the relationship between Emperor Tugh Temiir and his domineering minister, El Temiir. 50 Although the Yuanshi (see next note) obliquely places this event in Shundi's reign, Chiang, Yuandai Kuizhangge, 94-95 cites this passage within the context of Wenzong's rule. 5I Song, Yuanshi, I43.3414. 254</page><page sequence="13">be a gentleman (jun). His personal disgrace and the country's defeat all occurred because he could not be a gentleman. Everyone honors the man who can be a gentleman; others will not be valued. "5I [Text H] to political disintegration and foreign invasion.52 Presenting an image that could simultaneously praise and admonish the emperor was a frequent discursive strategy of the Kuizhangge scholars. Tugh Temuir was at once likened to and dissociated from a former Chinese ruler, an interpretive ploy that played well across several different audiences. Further, the image of Tugh Temiir accepting both praise and admonishment from his officials communicated the very message that the Kuizhangge had been asked to deliver: only a sage ruler accepts his ministers' honest advice.53 Genre Paintings At the other end of the spectrum of possible subjects for figural paintings were images of commoners engaged in agricultural or commercial endeavors; these too were a perennial favorite of the Kuizhangge scholars.54 The Water Mill (Zhakou panche tu), an early-eleventh-century painting now in the Shang- hai Museum, was among those presented to Tugh Temtir in the Kuizhangge as demonstrated by his large tianli zhibao seal affixed in the upper right of the painting (fig. 5). Adjacent to the seal appears the three-character inscription shenpin shang("above the divine class" - the highest possible ranking); although widely believed to be in Tugh Temiir's own hand, the assessment probably expresses the expert opinion of his court connoisseur, Ke Jiusi. Why was this painting singled out for such high praise? Clearly, the painting's technical virtuosity commands admiration; however, the subject of the painting could also be mined for Chinese symbols of good statecraft. The work depicts the collection, processing, and distribution of grain; figures are seen transport- ing bales of rice or wheat on boats and in oxcarts, winnowing grain, grinding flour, even consuming the end products of their labor (cakes and distilled beverages) in the wine shop in the lower right of the composition. The emphasis on commercial productivity founded on a successful agricultural econ- omy certainly was one locus of meaning in the painting's original eleventh-century context, when the image celebrated the rapidly expanding market economy of the Song dynasty.55s However, the inclu- 5z This version of the story can be found in Chen Gaohua, Song LiaoJin huajia shiliao (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1984), 627. He quotes from Huang Jin,Jinhua xiansheng wenji, juan I5. 53 A similar admonition about the dangers of being attached to things appears in Chen Lu's "Record of the Director of the Qunyu Neisi, Huazhi (Naonao), Inscribing his Name [on the Office Wall]. " See Chen Lu, Anyatangji (Wenyuange siku quanshu edition), 7.Ia-2b. 54 The only recorded memorial submitted by Ke Jiusi to the throne concerned agricultural production and grain dis- tribution, so such themes must have been among those discussed in the Kuizhangge. For the memorial, see Xu Xian, Beishi jijuan, translated in Cleaves, "The 'Fifteen 'Palace Poems" by KeJiusi," 414. 55 Heping Liu compellingly argues that this painting represents imperial commercial enterprises in the early Song. The connection to state-sponsored industry that Liu establishes is clearly in line with the interpretation provided by the Kuizhangge scholars for Tugh Temiir's benefit. See Liu's "'The Water Mill' and Northern Song Imperial Patronage of Art, Commerce, and Science," The Art Bulletin 84, 4 (December 2002): 566-595. 255</page><page sequence="14">sion of a tax collector in the upper left corner of the composition clearly links the agricultural, tech- nical, and commercial activities portrayed in the rest of the scroll to a centralized imperial bureau- cracy. In this reading, government receipts of grain tax symbolize the social order and economic pros- perity made possible by the emperor's benevolent administration of the empire. This last meaning was not lost on the Kuizhangge scholars, as attested by Yu Ji's colophon for a painting of this subject. Although Yu Ji's calligraphy is not attached to the Shanghai work, a poem for a painting by this title appears in Yu's collected works, Daoyuan leigao.56 The surviving text of Yu's Leigao does not explicitly note that YuJi wrote the colophon at Tugh Temiir 's command; however, the content of the poem clearly demonstrates that Yu composed the colophon for an imperial owner of the scroll. Yu's recorded poem closely describes the various pictorial elements evident in the Shang- hai painting bearing Tugh Temiir's seal. Further, the poem's structure and its rhetorical devices - most particularly the interjection of "My Lord, don't you see" between two seven-character quatrains - repeat the structure of other poems for paintings written by Tugh Temiir's scholars, including YuJi. With this evidence, we can reasonably associate the extant painting with the recorded poem. In the poem, Yu first describes the difficult work of the oxen carting grain from distant parts of the empire to the capital, as seen in the left foreground of the Shanghai painting. Then in the second couplet, Yu narrates a scene corresponding in detail with the upper left-hand portion of the extant scroll, the recording of grain receipts by a government official: The magistrate in his chair [checks for] irregularities in the tax [ledgers]; Recording the cash, he looks up to greet the expected arrivals. The following quatrain extends the scene beyond the frame of the current scroll; a device that serves to link the foregoing scene directly to centralized imperial control: My Lord, don't you see: 57 The million sea-going ships riding on a heavenly wind ? They halt at the capital, amid linked clouds, dark red [in the setting sun]. The Son of Heaven holds court in the Great Brilliance Palace; A thousand teams of horses and ten thousand riders arrive: what strength and ambition! 58 [Text I] How are we to understand YuJi's reading of this painting within the circumstances of Tugh Temiir's reign ? First, the glorification of the abundant harvest resonates with the implications of good Confu- cian rule in a settled, agricultural society. Within this scenario, the proof of Tugh Temiir's success as an emperor rests in his ability to oversee his realm with benevolence and thus command the favor of Heaven (in the form of good harvests) and the respect of his subjects (tax contributions). Thus, YuJi's 56 An early woodblock-printed edition ofYu's Leigao, dated to I345, survives in the Chinese National Library in Beijing. 57 "My Lord" refers to Tugh Temiir, to whom the following quatrain is addressed. 58 YuJi, Daoyuan leigao, 4.I4a. 2z6</page><page sequence="15">Fig. I Vajrabhairava Mandala, ca.

" At the same time, the scholar's reading of the painting encouraged the promo- tion of policies favorable to the Chinese agricultural economy. Again, positioning the painting as a didactic text enhanced the appearance that the emperor was receptive to the teachings and admoni- tions of his Confucian advisors. Given the choice of The Water Mill as appropriate imperial viewing material, we might find it sur- prising that the Kuizhangge scholars also selected for Tugh Temiir's appreciation a painting depict- ing non-Chinese travelers at a desert oasis, titled Drawing Water in Barbarian Territory (Jishbi fanbu) and attributed to Hu Qian (mid-tenth century). The scholars' interpretations of Drawing Water in Barbarian Territory draw upon the same discursive strategies seen in YuJi's reading of The Water Mill. The image has sadly been lost, but the colophon papers inscribed by Kuizhangge scholars have been saved and are now in the National Palace Museum, Taipei (fig. 6). Most of these poems can be cor- roborated by Yuan-dynasty wenji, including editions printed soon after the poems were written.59 The Taipei colophon sheet contains sequential comments by four different scholars, thus affording a glimpse into the rhetorical development and performative structure of a painting viewing in the Kuizhangge. The first inscription appropriately comes from the hand of the connoisseur Ke Jiusi. It reads: To the right is the Tang-dynasty6o painter Hu Qian's Drawing Water in Barbarian Territory. It entered the Song imperial collection during the Shaoxing period (II3I-II62) and has been handed down directly [without leaving the imperial collection]. The Kuizhangge Connoisseur of Callig- raphy, the Wenlin Scholar KeJiusi, authenticates it and respectfully adds this colophon.61 [TextJ] As an authentication, the colophon (like many written by Ke) reveals no specific interpretative scheme; however, by certifying the painting's legitimacy, Ke Jiusi performed an important political act. Fol- lowing the long tradition of using art collecting as a sign of imperial might, Tugh Temiir's appro- priation of authentic objects from the imperial collection of the previous dynasty represented his appro- priation of legitimate Chinese rulership. As the primary facilitator of this act of appropriation, Ke bol- stered Tugh Temiir's authority and performed the first act in the unfolding drama of the painting viewing. Next to take center stage, at least according to the sequence of poems on the Taipei colophon sheet, was YuJi: 59 Discrepancies between the early recorded texts and the calligraphic renditions in Taipei suggest that the colophon sheets were transcribed at some point, either from the original scroll or from the printed texts. The poem byjie Xisi appears in his Wen'anji from the late Yuan; the other by YuJi appeared in print in I345. 60 Ke Jiusi should have specified Hu Qian as a painter of the Latter Tang court. Although Hu's father, a Khitan, had been born in Central Asia, he immigrated to China and raised his son in the environment of the Latter Tang court painting academy. 6I To my knowledge, this colophon is not recorded in any Yuan-dynasty textual sources. z6s</page><page sequence="24">Camel carts cross a drying river, hurrying forward after several days; Old horses gallop on the sands towards the springs overflowing with water. With [their] bags completely filled, [they will have] no farewells at the border; [Only] the exertion of going beyond the Tianshan Mountains' deep snow drifts. My Lord, don't you see: The sagely Son of Heaven's grace is great! It stretches to the four seas through full, flowing rivers. Insects and plants feel the surplus moisture, And offer a song to the sweet spring and succulent dew.62 [Text K] This poem follows the model encountered in YuJi's inscription for The Water Mill. First, YuJi evokes a narrative based on pictorial elements in the painting and then urges his listener (ostensibly Tugh Temiir) to look closer for symbolic meaning: "My Lord, don't you see." In the concluding interpre- tive section, Yu draws out parallels to Tugh Temiir's imperial benevolence, symbolized here by the nurturing waters of a desert oasis. The personified insects and plants act as metaphors for the grateful subjects (or officials) who raise a song of praise to the imperial grace. A more halfhearted poem by LiJiong (I274-1332) comes next and, unlike Yu's poem, it raises ques- tions of ethnic identity and geographic correlatives: The well sweep63 looks as if he dreads his work, Not to mention the one carrying the load on his back. The courtyard steps look crowded and cramped; Another hundred li? Who can just hurry on? [On the road one] looks down at endless yellow desert grass; Looking up, the sky fills the four quarters. So why take only a brief glance around here, When it is so rich in water and fuel?64 [Text L] Li's poem expresses an aversion toward the barrenness of the steppe, the Mongol homeland. Should we understand his distaste for the endless stretches of sand as an affront to Tugh Temiir? Probably not. Is Li allowing the Mongol emperor to assume a Chinese perspective on the vast territories outside the Great Wall? Perhaps; some sources from Tugh Temiir's reign would support such a reading. For 62 Yu, Daoyuan xuegu lu, 1I.21. 63 A mechanism that uses pulleys to draw water from a well. Here the tool symbolizes the worker. 64 Curiously, this poem is in five-character regulated verse, unlike the seven-character lines of the other three poems in the series. I have not found it recorded in Yuan-dynasty sources. 266</page><page sequence="25">instance, the imperial memorial dedicating the Kuizhangge as a center ofConfucian learning voiced a similar perception of the emperor's ancestral homeland: "since my ancient ancestors knew only the life of want on the steppe, how could they have a general understanding of administering the rule of the country?" Read in this light, Li's poetic interpretation suggests his Mongol sovereign's insular affiliation with Chinese tastes and traditions, a pose that played well in Chinese bureaucratic circles. The imagery of the yellowed grasses, or sedge, in the poem also suggests another more nuanced reading. Sedge (shacao, "the grass of frugality") possessed a rich and complicated resonance in Yuan- dynasty court culture. One of Ke Jiusi's palace poems, written for Tugh Temiir, notes that Khubilai Khan had planted sedge outside the Great Hall of State (Damingdian) in order to remind himself of the struggle waged by his ancestors.65 For both Khubilai and Tugh Temiir, this transplanted desert grass represented the source of Mongol authority - and linked them historically and geographically to that authat authority. Tugh Temiir's imperial identity turned on the delicate balance between Chinese and Mongolian worldviews, so the ambivalent attitudes towards the steppe expressed in Li Jiong's poem balance the overtly fawning tone of the previous poem by Yu Ji. Li's diffident tone acknowledges the inherent difficulty faced by Tugh Temur as he navigated the spectrum of identitties required by his position. The final poem in the series, written bythe ambiguities of Li's poem. In fact,Jie's rejoinder makes the predicament of identity presented in Li Jiong's poem seem intentionally devised to heighten the dramatic effect of the imperial viewing session. Jie wrote: On the endless sand dunes the steppe grass is flattened; At the desert spring they dismount to fill their water bags. I once saw in a picture of a meeting of [foreign] kings, Travelers trekking beyond the snows of the Tianshan Mountains. At present, the emperor's virtue encompasses the whole universe - At the frontier, in the palace, everywhere; [even] farmers plow contentedly. This half scroll on silk painted by a Tang-dynasty artist, Is kept with the sovereign so that he might dwell temporarily in those distant circumstances.66 [Text M] Jie's poem again accentuates his and the other viewers' geographic and emotional distance from the steppe. But in the second quatrain, he isolates within that distance a multilayered meaning for the painting. First, the remoteness of the steppe is a metaphor for the expansiveness of Tugh Temiir's power through the whole known universe. Second, in the last couplet, he urges the emperor to "dwell tem- porarily" in an imagined geographic and historical space, effectively establishing a spatial link with 65 Cleaves, "The 'Fifteen 'Palace Poems" by KeJiusi," 419; and KeJiusi, Danqiu ji, in Lidai huajia shiwen ji (Taipei: Xuesheng shuju, 197I), 37. 66 Jie Xisi, Wen'anji (Wenyuange siku quanshu edition) (Taipei: National Palace Museum, 1981), 3.8. 267</page><page sequence="26">his Mongol homeland, not to mention the diachronic link to Tang-dynasty power in the same cou- plet. At the same time, encouraging the ruler to "dwell temporarily" in the world of tired laborers and thirsty travelers functions as an admonition, reminding him of the hardships of the common nomads of the steppe over whom he rules. Reading the poems in the sequence in which they appear on the colophon sheet suggests the devel- opment of a narrative trajectory. After the authentication of the work under consideration, a scholar comes forth to shower praise upon the emperor. Others follow with somewhat more serious topics of deliberation, presenting problems inherent to the subject of the painting (here, the geographic and temporal relationship of the court in Dadu to the landscape of the steppe). Finally, a scholar resolves the discussion by elaborating a metaphorical meaning for the scroll, a meaning that can serve as praise and admonition. The rich layers of interpretation situated within the didactic setting and tone of the viewing session exhibit an innovative approach to the use of the imperial art collections at Tugh Temiir's court. Unfortunately, some paintings with Tugh Temiir's seals have come down to us without an accom- panying poetic record. In the eleventh month of 1329, for instance, the Kuizhangge scholars presented Tugh Temiir with a painting of downtrodden common folk, Early Snow on the River (Jiangxing chuxue tu; fig. 7) by Zhao Gan (fl. mid-tenth century). Tugh Temiir's imperial seal and the group inscription listing the names of the scholars in attendance during the presentation (fig. 8) are the only evidence linking the scroll with the Kuizhangge. Early Snow features poor, barely clothed fishermen hard at work in the blustery cold of the first snowfall. James Cahill has pointed out that the Song-dynasty compilers of the Xuanhe huapu (the cat- alog of Emperor Huizong's painting collection) wrote that Zhao's paintings evoke so well the hard- ships of the common worker that "you feel as if you were there. "67 This sort of reading - calling upon imperial sympathy - was entirely possible within the Kuizhangge; both Early Snow and Drawing Water can be read as reminders of the emperor's duty to provide benevolent leadership for his subjects, here configured as southern Chinese fishermen. Recently, Chen Yunru has pointed out that unusually cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls beset Tugh Temiir's reign, a historical detail that supports the "as if you were there" interpretation.68 Since the scholars brought forth the painting in the eleventh month, the beginning of winter in the South (known to Tugh Temiir through personal experience during his years of exile), their choice may indeed have been intended to remind their sovereign of the plight of imperiled common folk. Unfortunately, since any poems that may have been written by the Kuizhangge staff for the painting have long since disappeared, readings of the painting within that context remain entirely conjectural. Religious Paintings Despite the Confucian overtones of many imperial painting viewings, paintings of Daoist and Bud- dhist subjects also found a place in the Kuizhangge. At one session, the scholars presented to Tugh 67 James Cahill, Three Alternative Histories of Chinese Painting (Lawrence, Kansas: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1988), 6I. 68 Chen Yunru, "Meng-Yuan huangshi de shuhua yishu," 280. She cites Liu Yueshen, Shenzhai ji, 2.5o4-505. z68</page><page sequence="27">Temiir a work attributed to the Tang-dynasty painter Han Huang portraying the Daoist astral deity Saturn in anthropomorphic form. The painted rendition of this theme seen by Tugh Temiir no longer exists, but poems by YuJi andJie Xisi written explicitly at the emperor's command have come down to us in their collected writings. The subject of the painting evokes the cosmology of the Five Phases, with Saturn correlating with earth, centrality, imperial status, yellow, oxen, and agricultural pro- ductivity.69 Jie Xisi's colophon for this image of Saturn provides a basic primer in this imperial sym- bolism for his Mongol sovereign: Among the Five Phases (wuxing), earth resides at the center; Among the hundred beasts, oxen are the most valuable. When the earth agent [Saturn] descends in the form of a god, He's riding an ox, that hairy old man! With earth, one must have an ox; But only the gods bestow the yearly harvest. Who could have known that Han Huang's meaning Was exactly the same as that in our emperor's heart ?70 [Text N] ForJie Xisi, the painting bespoke the virtues of agricultural productivity in a settled society (in marked contrast to the Mongolian nomadic horse culture). Further, the supplication of the gods, particularly those associated with fertility, had long been the prerogative and responsibility of the emperor. YuJi's inscription, laden with esoteric Daoist terminology, reads the painting as a talisman, with the image bearing New Year's tidings of agricultural prosperity. He wrote: Oh, the Yellow Deity fills the earth, His tame and obedient ox leads the others, as With crimson banners floating and fluttering in the eight winds, They ride to the fields of heaven and enter the Purple Palace.71 He calls the officials and functionaries to reward the Nine Farmers. Drumming, they cry out: "A year of repeated abundance and good harvests! "72 [Text O] 69 YuJi's " Record of the Five-Colored Stone Screen, " written in the eleventh month of 1329, elaborates on the significance of the Five Agents and explains the "wonders of imperial conformance with the desires of Heaven (tianxin). " See Yu, Daoyuan xuegu lu, 22.I6b-I8a. 70 Jie Xisi, Wen'an ji, 3.9. 7I Refers to a constellation comprising eighteen stars located to the northeast of the Big Dipper. It includes the pole star, which, because it remains in a fixed location in the sky, is associated with central authority and the imperial house. 72 Yu, Daoyuan xuegu 1L, 2I.IIa. 269</page><page sequence="28">Celebrating the Daoist god of the earth, whose power correlates with that of the earthly ruler, calls attention to the divine authority invested in the emperor. In this poem, then, Saturn's order to bestow plenty refers directly to the Mandate of Heaven, whereby the good ruler reaps the rewards of abun- dant harvests and a satisfied populace. Tugh Temiir's tianli zhibao seal also appears on the Buddhist painting Barbarian Royalty Worship- ping Buddha (Manwang lifo tu), attributed to the tenth-century painter Zhao Guangfu (fig. 9). Again, no inscriptions by Tugh Temiir's scholars have been recorded, so we may only suggest possible inter- pretations for this work within the Kuizhangge. The iconographic structure, with the processional group of ethnically mixed dignitaries (including a Chinese man) bearing gifts for the Buddha, brings to mind the common painting genre of foreigners bringing tribute to the Chinese emperor (fig. Io). Read as a hybrid of two genres - religious icons and tribute scenes - we can imagine the Buddha stand- ing in as an emblem for the ruler, in keeping with the long-standing tradition of portraying rulers, both Chinese and non-Chinese, in the guise of Buddhist and Daoist deities. In these portraits, the emperor assumes the Buddha's benevolence and compassion, while also partaking of his righteous power.73 In the Yuan dynasty, many members of the imperial family were devout Tibetan Buddhists who would have readily recognized this imperial cum religious symbol.74 We may also be reminded of the foreign origins of both Buddhism and Mongol power in China, a similarity that could not have been lost upon the Kuizhangge scholars since a pre-existing inscrip- tion by Zhao Mengfu (I254-I323) still attached to the scroll emphasizes the foreign aspect of Bud- dhism. Wai-kam Ho translates Zhao's inscription as follows: Buddha's religion reached China more than a thousand years ago, and his image is probably in every household. Whoever sees him is filled with reverence. Nor should it make any difference whether the painter [of the Buddha] is ancient or modern.75 [Text P] Drawing on the heuristic practices of the Kuizhangge scholars, among whom meaning was located in the metaphoric or allegorical potential of pictorial themes to express characteristics of imperial author- ity, we might read this inscription that praises the long-lived popular success of Buddhism in China as providing a corollary for Mongol power in China: "May the Yuan dynasty also have a thousand years of success in China." 73 For an enlightening discussion of the concept of the bodhisattva-emperor in the Yuan, see David M. Farquhar, "Emperor as Bodhisattva in the Governance of the Ch'ing Empire, " HarvardJournal of Asiatic Studies 38, I (June I987): II-I1.

Surviving colophons that may have been written for Tugh Temiir include Yu Ji's inscription for a painting of a lohan, and Jie Xisi's colophon for a bod- hisattva painting. 75 Wai-kam Ho et al., Eight Dynsties of Chinese Painting (Cleveland: Cleveland Museum of Art, I980), 6o. 270</page><page sequence="29">The wide range of non-Chinese groups represented in the painting also reminds us of Tugh Temiir's connection with the geographic and demographic expanse of the Mongol Empire. Starting with Khu- bilai's reign, the Yuan emperor possessed a political portfolio more significant than the ruler of China; he was also the Great Khan, the ostensible leader of all the Mongolian kingdoms stretching across Cen- tral Asia.76 This painting, with its inclusion of so many ethnic types, perhaps suggested to the Kuizhangge scholars (a group of mixed ethnicity) Tugh Temiir's nominal power over the broad ter- ritories of Central Asia and beyond. The many levels of potential religious and political meaning in this painting must have made its selection for imperial viewing particularly appropriate. The specific readings made by the Kuizhangge scholars, however, remain unknown. Landscapes In addition to figural paintings with readily accessible metaphorical content, the scholars also pre- sented antique Chinese landscape paintings. Tugh Temiir regarded these works with special fondness since as a child he had learned to paint landscapes.77 Although a number of Song-dynasty landscape paintings bear Tugh Temiir's seals, only one has an accompanying poem series still extant.78 Dong Yuan's Waitingfor the Ferry in Summer Mountains (Xiajing shankou daidu tu), in the Liaoning Provincial Museum, bears Tugh Temiir's tianli zhibao seal and colophons by the Kuizhangge officials KeJiusi, YuJi, LiJiong, and Ya Hu (b. ca. 1300) (figs. II, I2).79 Although the extant colophons may be later copies, the validity of Yu Ji's text is indisputable since it appears in his literary collection printed by 1345 (as attested by a surviving copy in the Chinese National Library in Beijing) and per- haps even earlier. The imperial seal also appears to be genuine.80 The painting depicts gentle, rolling hills with meandering streams; human figures wahder the riverside path and pole small skiffs across the placid waters. 76 Dardess, Conquerors and Confucians, 7. He writes, "Down to I329, the emperor of the Yuan Dynasty still remained to some degree the Great Qaghan of the Mongol Empire precisely because the all-important question of succession was not one necessarily to be determined by domestic Chinese political considerations alone. " Nonetheless, in the absence of any other leader filling the position of Great Khan, Tugh Temiir nominally held this position. 77 See Weidner [Haufler], "Painting and Patronage at the Mongol Court," 18; citing Tao Zongyi. 78 Other surviving landscape paintings once in Tugh Temiir's collection include Guan Tong's Travelers in Mountains in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, and Fan Kuan's Temple Among Snowy Mountains in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Two other landscape paintings bearing Tugh Temiir's seals were recorded by later catalogers. See Fu, Yuandi huangshi shuhua shoucang, 54-5. 79 Ya Hu was the Chinese name of Yakut, a Christian of the Onggiid tribe. See Wang Deyi et al., Yuanren chuanji ziliao suzoyin, vol. 4 (reprint, Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, I987), 2728. Li Jiong, a native of Jinan, Shandong province, was a successful official and renowned writer of plays. Although several of Ya Hu's and LiJiong's poems appear in the Qing- dynasty Yuanshi xzuan, this one is not among them. See Gu Sili, Yuanshi xuan, second series, vol. I (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1987), 559-57I- 80 Richard Barnhart has proposed a seventeenth-century dating for this painting: "The style of the work... could sup- port [a seventeenth-century date], as could the raw and superficial appearance of the colophons. " Barnhart, The Mar- riage of the Lord of the River (Ascona: Artibus Asiae, 1970), I9. Fu Shen believes the seal is genuine; Fu, Yuandi huang- shi shuhua shoucang, 53. 27I</page><page sequence="30">At first glance, the painting appears wholly inaccessible to a political reading, yet the four schol- ars construe the painting as an allegory of official service. In the first few lines, each poet describes the beautiful forests, mountains, and streams, and remarks on the evocation of misty rain. Ya Hu directly invokes the classical metaphor of nourishing rain for imperial benevolence. The other poets focus on the final scene in which a traveler approaches the ford at river's edge. Ke Jiusi and YuJi describe the trusting relationship between the boatman and the passimage as an allegory of ded- icated and loyal service. Ke notes their mutual contentment, while Yu, observing the last section of the scroll (fig. I3), asserts his willingness to work for a common goal: The man walking under the willow trees wants to cross [the river]; Coming to the stream but unable the stream but unable to cross, he is dispirited. [I] row forcefully and my boat is strong; Assisting inting s , [I] believe, will not be difficult.8 [Text Q] The reading of the paing ng as an affirmation of loyalty by dedicated officials willing to serve a right- eous emperor certainly served a political function, but the poems lack the admonishing voice we encounter in other poem series. In fact, the emphasis on personal service to the emperor in these poems seems somewhat at odds with other Kuizhangge colophon-poem series that are replete with images of power and legitimacy. Ke Jiusi tells us that the viewing occurred in the first month of the third year of the Tianli period (I330), a month in which a number of prominent officials in Tugh Temiir's government, most of them Kuizhangge scholars, submitted their resignations.82 The emperor refused them all, and instead show- ered them with gifts, new titles, and a written confirmation of the importance of their task. Clearly, the event commemorated in these poems was but one among a sequence of political maneuvers by var- ious groups at the central court. To this extent, Dong Yuan's painting functioned as the proverbial old bottle into which the newly vinted Kuizhangge wine was poured. Horse Paintings Although the Mongol emperors, in keeping with their nomadic culture, may have especially favored horse painting, it appears that equestrian imagery received relatively little attention in the Kuizhangge. No surviving horse paintings bear Tugh Temiir's seals or colophons by his appointed scholars; however, sets of short poems written at imperial command for two paintings (by the Tang artists Han Gan and Cao Ba) appear in the collected writings of YuJi and Jie Xisi. All of these poems read the paintings as metaphors for loyal officials who apply their abundant talents in the service of 81 Yu, Daoyuan xuegu lu, 2I.9a. 82 The reign name was changed to Zhishun in the fifth month of this year, so retrospectively I330 is usually referred to as Zhishun I. However, this colophon was signed and dated prior to the fifth month of the year, so it retains the orig- inal tianli 3 date. Song, Yuanshi, 34.757. 272</page><page sequence="31">the emperor. For instance, oozing with sycophantic sentiments, YuJi's colophon for Cao Ba's paint- ing of a stabled horse reads:83 He has been in the stable for so many years, eating his fill of hay; Whoever is familiar with horse language can understand his [constant] pacing. Heavily showered with imperial favor, he knows how to do his duty. Perhaps he will pull the drum chariot84 for the Eastern Sacrifice.8s [Text R] The pent-up horse who longs ambitiously to serve is a metaphor for the official hoping for an impor- tant assignment. Likewise, Jie Xisi's three-stanza colophon for a horse painting attributed to Han Gan evokes the same impatient aspirations of the horse (cum official) to go dutifully to battle for the emperor:86 Keep in mind that before this horse [portrait] was painted, The [Tang] had already wiped out Wu and Yue, and had obliterated Yan and Qin. Reined in, he lets out a long cry; the wind [from his hooves] pounding the earth, Like innumerable Hua Lius and qilins.87 [Text S] These poems functioned as declarations of steadfast loyalty at a court shaken by divisiveness and inse- curity. To the extent that a strong ruler inspires loyalty in his people, and especially his ministers, these readings can be understood as integral to the desired imperial image. However, the officials also used these antique paintings as an avowal of their own allegiance and must have had their own inter- ests in mind as well. 83 Yu, Daoyuan xuegu lu, zI.IIa. In his Huajian, Tang Hou also mentioned a painting by the same title attributed to Cao Ba. He describes the work as a double portrait of two horses, one black and one bay (reddish-brown), with a stable hand standing behind them. See Tang Hou, Huajian, ed. Ma Cai (Beijing: Renmin meishu chubanshe, I962), 9-Io. 84 The drum chariot is a Han-dynasty invention similar to an odometer. Made of wood, the chariot carried a drum and two figures rigged to a gearbox. After one mile (li), the gearbox would open a switch to allow one figure to strike the drum once; at the next mile mark, the other figure would drum a beat. This vehicle led the ritual procession. 85 The annual sacrifice to Mt. Taishan performed by the emperor. 86 This colophon was recorded in Jie Xisi's Wen'anji; the text of YuJi's colophon appears in Daoyuan xuegulz, MI.11. The colophon by YuJi for the same painting reads: The Kaiyuan-period corral, now strewn with autumn's sandy brambles, New paintings by Han Gan are never to be had again. But in Heaven's stable are "true dragons" with marvelous physique, Thus you know that the high officials strive to distinguish themselves. The entire third line is a metaphor for talented and loyal officials: " true dragons " are fine horses;" marvelous physique " is literally qigu, strange bones. I have chosen to translate Hua Liu, the name of a famed Tang-dynasty horse, as "to be like Hua Liu," thus distinguish oneself. 87 A qilin is a mythical beast, the unicorn. 273</page><page sequence="32">CONCLUSION These last inscriptions raise important questions of agency and audience: How involved was Tugh Temiir in the reading of paintings at the Kuizhangge ? And who, besides the emperor, read the poems ? These questions, while difficult to answer with complete confidence, deserve consideration. Certainly Tugh Temiir had the skills to appreciate the paintings and understand the poems. His Chinese linguistic and cultural literacy were, in fact, quite well developed; he could read and write Chinese and paint in the Chinese manner. Tao Zongyi, writing in the late Yuan long after the Kuizhangge became defunct, praises the beauty of Tugh Temiir's calligraphy.88 Tao also notes that Tugh Temiir appreciated calligraphy and engaged in gift exchanges of " ink traces " with several of the Kuizhangge officials. Nonetheless, in the textual records of the Kuizhangge and in some of the colophons, the scholars' task is to teach, admonish, and counsel Tugh Temiir. They act, while the emperor serves as a receptacle for their actions and words. Many of the painting inscriptions refer to or imply the emperor's presence ("My lord, don't you see"); however, Tugh Temiir 's voice - his side of the conversation - is mute. Thus Tugh Temiir's position at the painting viewings paralleled his role as the vehicle through which El Temiir and Bayan actually ruled. The emperor is a presence but not an actor. His antique paintings, in the hands of his top officials writing at his behest (yingzhi, lit- erally "in response to imperial order"), become receptacles for ideas that the emperor ostensibly endorses but does not assert in his own right. Technically, the scholars' interpretations were made for an audience of one: Tugh Temiir. Func- tionally, their audience had a wider constituency, including numerous other officials present at the viewings - and their friends, students, and relatives - as well as clerks, scribes, and other Kuizhangge functionaries. Each scholar kept his own copy of his poem, and perhaps copies of the matching poems. During the Yuan dynasty, poems and essays circulated in a variety of forms, from ink rubbings of inscribed stones, to transcriptions made by friends and family members, to commercially printed edi- tions of an individual writer's works, to larger group anthologies selected by other scholars and printed by commercial publishers.89 Furthermore, throughout the fourteenth century, YuJi, Jie Xisi, Ouyang Xuan, and Ke Jiusi en- joyed reputations as the finest writers of their generation. YuJi and Jie Xisi figure among the "Four Great Writers" of the Yuan; collections of their writings, including some of these poems, appeared in commercially printed volumes as early as I340. Ouyang Xuan ranked first in the newly revived palace exams of 13I5, an achievement that brought him far-reaching attention. Yu,Jie, and Ouyang possessed extensive scholarly and political portfolios; they all served successive emperors in careers that spanned several generations. Their joint presence in the Kuizhangge, not to mention the presence of other, more prominent figures, could not have gone unnoticed in the capital, nor would it have been ignored by their many friends and colleagues serving in provincial governments. Indeed, Yu wrote several formal 88 Tao Zongyi, Shushi huiyao (Shanghai: Shanghai shudian, I984), 7.I. 89 See, for example, the five anthologies included in Luo Zhenyu and Jiang Yi, Yuanren xuan yzanshi (Selections of Yuan poetry edited by Yuan writers) (Taipei: Datong shuju, I973). Unlike the Qing-dynasty anthology Yuanshi xuan, the five anthologies in Luo and Jiang's book come down to us in Yuan- and early-Ming-dynasty editions. 274</page><page sequence="33">edicts justifying and affirming Tugh Temuir's legitimate succession, edicts intended for a broad audi- ence of scholar-officials, local gentry, and imperial kin. The emperor issued his own official hand- written "Records of the Founding of the Kuizhangge" (composed by Yuji), and his presence at impe- rial painting viewings was widely acknowledged. In other words, the display of imperial identity did not stop at the gates of the Kuizhangge compound. None of the foregoing evidence proves that the colophon poems translated and discussed in this article circulated widely, or that the scholars intentionally wrote these poems for an audience that extended beyond their own small circle. However, the mechanisms for the reproduction and distri- bution of literary work - especially texts by prominent writers - functioned well during the period under consideration. Moreover, given the lingering aura of illegitimacy surrounding Tugh Temur's court, the dissemination of evidence demonstrating his private and public virtues was not only unre- stricted, but also desirable. In short, the possibility that these poems for paintings found readers out- side the inner court is much stronger than the possibility that the poems remained hidden away inside the Kuizhangge. Tugh Temur's reign lasted only three years, but his engagement with the palace painting collec- tion remains an important moment in the history of collecting. Prior to the mid-Yuan, emperors rarely requested that their court officials do any more than authenticate, categorize, and properly maintain the imperial collection. Most importantly, poem cycles written for antique items in the imperial col- lection do not exist from earlier reigns. Song Huizong, captivated by the beauty of the present, ordered officials staffing the Xuanhedian to write poems for his own recently completed paintings, or for por- tentous natural events occurring in the library garden.90 But he did not request or write poems for paintings already in the collection. Even among private collectors, the writing of metaphorical or alle- gorical inscriptions for antique paintings began to take shape only in the late Northern Song and developed slowly during the Southern Song.91 The writing of inscriptions for paintings came of age in the Yuan and flourished as never before. The practice spread from private collectors to the court in the mid-fourteenth century. Sengge Ragi, Tugh Temuir's mother-in-law, was the first to invite scholars to compose series of poems for her collection; her connoisseurial habits were most likely the model for the painting viewings organized in the Kuizhangge. The concerted effort of the emperor and his scholars to mold an imperial identity through cultural activities became even more prevalent in the succeeding centuries. Zhenghua Wang and Kathleen Lis- comb, in their respective studies of visual culture at the mid-Ming court, have shown how paintings were put to symbolic and rhetorical use in order to create and sustain a kind of identity politics. Per- haps the phenomena described by Wang and Liscomb can be traced back to the middle Yuan.92 90 See Li Lu on a new growth of bamboo, Danxuanji (Wenyuange siku quanshu edition) 2.J6; and Zhai Ruwen on a jade fungus growing on an old cassia tree, Zhonghuiji (Wenyuange siku quanshu edition), 5.25. 91 Stuart H.

The Qianlong emperor, the great architect of imperial identity politics in the Qing, also fashioned for himself a gentlemanly persona through his love of the arts and personal attention to his collection. Seen in this light, Tugh Temiir not only inherited a tradition of Chinese imperial collecting, but also oversaw a shift in its meaning, a shift that presaged some of the imperial cultural practices of the Ming and Qing courts.
