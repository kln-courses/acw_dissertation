In the seven- ties, after the appearance of HIartel's first Homerische Studien, Rzach applied the sta- tistical method to Hesiod, and produced treatises upon his language and dialect which still hold the field. In 1884 he pub- lished a handy text in Schenkls' Bibliotheca, and then and later collected the entire MS. evidence for the text, weighed the value of the codices and established their connec- tion in many articles in Wiener Studien and elsewhere. The whole critical instrument,</page><page sequence="2">262 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. gathered by a steady and certain method that leaves nothing to undo and little to add, is now given to the reader in this admirable volume. It is remarkable that the same year and publishing firm should have put forth two such monuments of a life's labour as Ludwich's Iliad and Rzach's Hesiod. The features of this edition are firstly the complete MS. evidence, including the recent papyri, which, if scanty are remark- able; next the mass of testimonia and imitations, even by themselves excel- lent and instructive reading; then a very rich apparatus criticus containing besides the variants a great deal of dialectal and grammatical information. The Fragments which with the Certamen and an index of names, complete the book, include the lately discovered scraps of papyrus, conveniently rescued from the periodicals where their editors had interred them. There is no real contentment in the world, and the 'lector improbus' would still like Prof. Rzach to provide him with a complete and uniform edition of the scholia, Proclus' commentary, and exegetical notes on the whole author. This sort of book cannot be reviewed. All that a reader can do is to note some points that have struck him which involve principles of editing. The Hesiodean text has in most modern editions been cut up into shreds, and these sometimes as in Goettling separated by lines: there seems rio justification for this arrangement. It is true the topics of the Works and Days are various, and the subject changes frequently ; but the same is the case with Virgil's Georgics which as they are u-ually printed do not present the curious appearance of Hesiod. The reader is prejudiced by such a gaping page and tends to believe he is contemplating an aggregation of proverbs. It is, however, only just to admit Rzach's moderation in this, as indeed in every respect. 'The commentary contains an inordinate number of the thoughts, the reverse of happy, of previous editors: 'suspi.ionem movit Paleio,' 'pro insiticio habuit Guyet,' 'uncis inclusit Wolf,' are distressingly fre- quent, and we know that these critics had no other ground for their suspicions than, like their predecessors Aristarchus and Plutarch, their aesthetic judgment, in other words no ground at all. No doubt the public demands this registration of things better forgotten; but unfortunately though the editor is temperate compared to his predecessors, too many brackets have found their way into the text in obedience to such authority. A bracket is a doubtful typo- graphical expedient, and hopelessly pre- judices most readers against the passage it encloses. To take a cardinal instance, the autobiographical passage, OD. 654 sq., about Hesiod's first and only voyage, and the hymn he recited at the funeral of Amphidamas is gravely damaged in the eyes of the average reader, merely because Plutarch, who possessed about as much historical sense as Cobet or Aristarchus,1 thought the lines contained oi'lv Xpy7rdv. The like imaginary reasons account for most of the transpositions also, which, though fewer in number, occur in the text. The editor has been careful about printing conjectures, but those he has accepted are a very doubtful improvement. I mean such as Wachler's -ptro&amp;L /3poiol for flpor OD. 533, Usener's $eXo0cr-L for E'$Eog0a ib. 218, Peppmiiller's bv EI7ProrLF XOtOvLo for rrd 7' EV7p1jrov XOdoto Theog. 863, Wila- mowitz's o'wIpP0Lry pcLEydXaLs for 7epao-Lv iv /LEydaXoL Theog. 335, Scheer's peculiarly use- less alO'pa for rjtpa ib. 697, and Stadtmiiller's dreadful 6E3p' acr&amp;s for 8' $caGrLT ib. 659. The question how far forms whose exist- ence comparative philology has recovered should be inserted in our current texts is a wide one, and compared to many editors Rzach may almost be called timid. At the same time one may doubt the practical advantage of confronting the reader with such forms as iaplwva, Ijda, rioo-dopov, 4$EC- oLEoE and the like. If we use the post- Euclidean alphabet, why do we try to clothe in it prae-Euclidean forms ? The printing is admirable. The disposi- tion of the page, size of the type, and excellence of the paper may be recommended to the attention of many of our publishers. The book, strange to say, is dated, and- a still more singular circumstance-paged. T. W. ALLEN. 1 Or Hiller who (Rh. Mus. 42. 321) thinks the similar autobiographical passage in the hymn to Apollo may be a later addition, to support the attribution of the hymn to Homer. This is philological anthropomorphism; they do not hesitate et bona dis ex hac scelerata ducere pulpac. Because .they think personal references undignified in epos, they will not allow an epic poet to be personal. But there are signs that this is a pure anachronism; cf. the well-known fragment Hes. 265 Av ALAA -d7E 7'pc~0,ro dTyo lcal OEoS "O/.tlpoS I .'XL-orE' ic.r.h. and the question and answer between Homer and Hesiod at Chalcis which Plutarch (Cony. Sept. Sap. 10) gives on the authority of Lescher. It is mere super- erogation to invent 'Leschem quendam, non anti- guum Pyrrhaeum sed multo recentiorem' here (Gott- ling ed. p. xxviii.) and not to recognise the author of the Little Ilia(1, speaking of course as Homer.</page></plain_text>
