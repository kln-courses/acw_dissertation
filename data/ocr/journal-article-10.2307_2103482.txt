<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY* What is existence? Is it an epistemological or a purely ontological con- cept? Is existence the same as reality and also the same as being? In the history of Western philosophy we do not find unanimity in the answers to the questions. According to some writers, when the Greeks said that the world of sense was not real, they did not mean that it had no existence and so drew a distinction between existence and reality. According to Hegel, Being is the poorest category. In his dialectic he deduced Reality and Negation from Being, and spoke of Existence as a distinct category from Being and Reality. Thus in Hegel's philosophy, Being, Reality, and Existence do not mean the same. But in Indian philosophy, the three mean the same. Sat and satta mean all the three. Satyam, which means truth, is an abstract noun derived from sat like satta, the last ta and yam being suffixes added to the original word sat (the root being as) in the same sense. But in Western epistemology, the three words are used in the same sense also, the object that is not real being the same as the one that does not exist, is not true or simply is not. This conflicting usage introduced much confusion into philosophic thought; so that when one approaches modern existentialism with, for instance, the Indian philosophical back- ground, one feels that one is studying something vague and does not feel the ground under one's feet. Even if the existentialists mean by existence human existence, they seem to refer to something of which one does not feel directly or indirectly sure. One expects human existence to be accessi- ble to human experience. This paper is not a critique of existentialism: it only shows that what we wish to study eludes our grasp even at the end of our study. It is true that often in the beginning of our study what we wish to study is vague and our ideas about it are only provisional and need clarification and definition. But so far as the idea of existence is concerned, we seem to be at the same point at the end of our study as at the beginning; perhaps because existence, we imagine, is so simple a concept that it does not need clarification. But when we allow several notions of existence to influence our thought, the latter becomes confused. Does this difficulty not show that we cannot divorce metaphysics and epistemology from each other? Indeed for Hegel, logic and metaphysics were one and his logic was epistemological.' For the Greeks also they were one; and their view that the world of sense is not real was based upon * Read before the New York Philosophy Club, December 20, 1949. 1 Idealistic logic is called often epistemological and philosophical logic. 265</page><page sequence="2">266 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH epistemology. But we are unnecessarily frightened by the conclusion and try to allay our fears by interpreting the Greek theory as drawing a dis- tinction between existence and reality. The difficulty in Hegel's philosophy is that, though his metaphysics was ultimately based upon epistemology, he not merely left back the epistemological situation but straightaway assumed that his philosophy began after reason attained the level of Absolute Consciousness, for which the object of knowledge is not alien. But at that level the epistemological problem of existence ceases to have any significance, for the Absolute Consciousness would never experience a non-existent object. That is why his negation does not have reference to a non-existent object but to a different object. For instance, if we mistake a rope for a snake in illusion and later discover our mistake and make the judgment, "The snake was not real," we mean that the snake we saw had no being but not that being is too poor a category to be possessed even by an illusory snake.2 It will perhaps be said that even the illusory snake has psychological being, existence, or reality. But when we ask the question, "Was the snake an existent snake?" "Was it true or real?" we do not ask whether it had psychological existence or not. The mental image or picture of the snake is not an object of epistemological investigation; and our attitude when we put the first type of question is epistemological, not psychological. No amount of psychological being can confer upon an object the status of belonging to the objective order. And if we mix up the psy- chological and epistemological attitudes, we cut at the root of the episte- mological distinction between existence and non-existence, reality and unreality, and truth and falsity. Psychologically, there is nothing that is non-existence except what we do not even imagine; and the problem of existence and non-existence of something that we do not even imagine has no point. The problem has meaning only when it is epistemological or metaphysical. Again, as an epistemological concept, existence has meaning only for the human mind, which is finite. We have no evidence for saying that animals intellectually draw a distinction between existent and non-existent objects, though they direct their activity generally toward existent objects and come to grief when they direct it toward the non-existent like mirages. 2 The objection may be raised that illusory objects also are existent objects, but they belong to the realm of possible existence. But the word possible has a very am- biguous meaning. Everything that is not impossible or is not opposed to the known laws of reality, is possible. But it is not significantly possible. What is significantly possible is that the conditions of the existence of which are partly fulfilled. Thus the possible has meaning ouly at the logical level of reason. At the perceptual level of truth and falsity, it would be confusing to introduce the concept. Further, possible existence is not existence. It may exist in future, but perception and illusion, which give rise to the present problem, deal with the present.</page><page sequence="3">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY 267 And from the Absolute point of view also, the question does not arise; for such a consciousness will not perceive a non-existent object, just for the reason that it is Absolute Consciousness. At this point of our inquiry, we need not raise the question whether Absolute Consciousness is true. For argument's sake, we may admit its truth. It will perhaps be asked whether existence is not to be accepted straight- away, whether we are justified in raising a problem about it by contrasting it with non-existence. But so long as non-existence incessantly intrudes into our experience, we cannot escape raising the problem; otherwise, we may confuse existence and non-existence and bring disaster upon ourselves. Hence we are forced to differentiate existence from non-existence and understand the conditions of both. Another idea that needs clarification is that both existence and non- existence fall within experience. In one sense, this view is true, but in another it is not. It is true that existence and non-existence have meaning for experience. But it may be asked how there can be experience of a non-existent entity. For what we are aware of as non-existent is never perceived by us. Or to be more precise, in the very act of perception, either true or false, we are not aware of the object as non-existent. As, in episte- mology, it is the illusory object that leads us to the distinction between existence and non-existence, it is imcumbent on us to identify existence with true objects and non-existence with illusory objects. At this point, our distinction needs modification. It is true that our experience of true and illusory objects is an occasion for the distinction between existence and non-existence in epistemology. But there is another occasion for the same distinction, namely our experience of the difference between imaginary objects and perceived objects. We are aware of the objects of imagination even during the process of imagination as non- existent objects. But if questioned, we indeed say that they have no existence or reality. But we say also that they are neither true nor false, for logic and epistemology can have little to do with mental images. Thus we so far find that, while truth, reality, and existence, seem to be identical in their reference, non-existence and unreality seem to extend beyond epistemology and falsity seems to be limited to epistemology. An illusory object is false, because it lays claim to truth and is unable to support its claim. But an imaginary object, though non-existent, makes no claim to truth and therefore cannot be regarded as false. Then we get two kinds of non-existent objects, the illusory and the imaginary. In fact, the child, which treats the objects of imagination and percep- tion equally as objects, does not make the distinction between truth and falsity. Hence one of the essential conditions of the epistemological situa- tion is our ability to distinguish between imaginary objects and the per-</page><page sequence="4">268 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ceptual. Then again among perceptual objects, we have two kinds, the true and the false. The false again may be divided into two kinds, the il- lusory and the hallucinatory. In illusion, we mistake a true object like a rope for a false object like a snake. So illusion has an objective basis. But in hallucination, there is no objective basis. Yet in both illusion and hal- lucination, there is an objective reference. But for the objective reference, it would be meaningless to call the objects of illusion and hallucination false. And because there is no objective reference in imagination, we do not call the imaginary objects false. We still call them objects of imagination; we say they are non-existent, unreal; but we add that, as truth-claim is not made by those objects, it is meaningless to call them either true or false. Now, the question will be raised here: As the imaginary objects also make no claim to reality and existence, they should not be called unreal and non-existent. The problem at this level has already become complex, a problem of both language and epistemology. We have been accustomed to use all the three terms indifferently, sometimes as synonyms and other times as having distinct meanings. Existence and reality may be used to mean subjective and objective reality. In that case, the words lose their epistemological importance. But other times they are referred only to ob- jective existence and reality, the subjective being identified with non-ex- istence and unreality. Then the words are given epistemological significance. We can perhaps get over this confusion by noting the logical import for the present without attaching too much importance to the words used in popular language. Purely imaginary objects as well as perceptual objects, objects to which we make both a subjective and an objective reference, fall within experience. The division between the two classes is made within experience. We are not prepared to call the former class false, because the question of falsity and truth is not applicable to them. Strictly, it is applicable to objects to which we make an objective reference. This class is thus to be divided into false and true objects; and our common world consists of true objects, and we understand it according to laws we discover in it, or we interrelate these objects according to certain laws. The false objects consist of hallu- cinations and illusions. But while the imaginary falls outside epistemology, it does not fall out- side existence. We say that the imaginary object has psychic or mental existence or reality. Thus existence seems to reach beyond epistemology in our experience. Are there any objects about which we can say that they have no mental existence even? One such object seems to be the self-con- tradictory idea like the circular square (for the present accepting that the circular square is an impossible object.) Just as an object can never be made physically actual by applying opposed physical laws, no object can</page><page sequence="5">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY 269 be imagined if its completion depends upon imagination working in op- posite ways at the same time. Yes, we do think of a circular square, but we think of it as an object that is incapable of being imagined. Thus there seems to be a class of objects that are impossibles for imagination. If it is said that to be thought of is the same as to have mental existence, we have to draw the further distinction between existence in thought and existence in imagination. But existence in thought may not have any embodiment at all unlike the imaginary and the physical. What should be said about objects like the / -1 ? Indeed it cannot be imagined. Can it be said to have mental existence? It is an abstraction derived by our thought working on some feature of actual things and valid with reference to it. Of course, it is not a perceptual truth, but a conceptual truth connected with perceptual truth, not negatively as what is opposed but positively as what is derived and developed by combining in thought certain pervasive features and re- lations belonging to existent objects. With regard to mathematical objects also we raise the question of truth and falsity. But the truth and falsity of an object here is determined not by the object itself-for there may not be such physical objects-but by the method the application of which may be consistent or inconsistent. That is why some would like to draw the distinction between existence and subsistence or between truth and validity, saying that mathematical en- tities do not exist but subsist, are not true but valid. Then we have to say that epistemology is here extended beyond the perceptual level, in which the constraint which the object puts upon us for recognizing its existence or truth, the necessity that puts a limit on the free play of our mental proc- ess, comes not directly from a perceived object but from a principle derived and abstracted from a perceived object and voluntarily made the controller of our thought. Further, if ideas like V-1 are valid but not true, and per- ceptual judgments like "That is a pen" or statements like "Socrates is mortal" are both true and valid, then we have to draw a further distinc- tion between truth and validity, which overlap each other but do not co- incide. Then we have to distinguish again between truth on the one side and existence or reality on the other. Now, confining ourselves to the level of perceptual experience, in which we first come across the distinction between existence and non-existence, truth and falsity, and reality and unreality, we find that as epistemology is confined to the realm of truth and falsity, existence goes beyond epis- temology. We may say at this point of discussion that ontology goes be- yond epistemology. This is a conclusion to which one analysis of our ex- perience leads us, though we started with the idea that epistemologically truth and existence are the same. This provisional identification in the light of other experiences and consequent reflections, we find, needs modifica-</page><page sequence="6">270 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH tion, which should therefore be treated as only provisionally valid. And this modification is necessary. Otherwise, much confusion will be let into epistemology by the indifferent use of the terms existence and truth. A true object is an existent object; but an existent object may not be true, for ex- istence may be not merely epistemological but psychological. As we speak of psychological reality also, we may use existence and reality as synonyms. II Now, what is the existent or true object in the epistemological situation? When we see an object in front and say "That is a snake," it is not mere existence that is perceived by us but a determinate form of existence. Be- cause of its determinateness, it is essence combined with existence. Sup- posing our perception is false and the object turns out to be a mere rope and we say "That is a rope but not a snake," we negate the predicate, the essence or determinant but not the That or3 existence that is referred to in the judgment. Here we do not wish to say that there was no object at all in front of us but that the object in front of us was not really a snake. In other words, the essence "snake" did not have true existence. Then how could we have seen it, even during illusion, as existing? We say that its existence was really the existence of the rope. Our conclusion naturally must be that the existence of the snake must have been only borrowed ex- istence. In the case of hallucination, when we realize our mistake, we do not merely say, for instance, "That is not a ghost," but that there is no object at all. That is, we deny both the subject and the predicate. But as in illusion, we adopt an objective attitude toward hallucination. Indeed, it is possible to say that here also, when we realize our mistake, we negate only the predicate and the subject remains the particular space and time where the object was perceived. But we do not get sufficient confirmation of this interpretation. In illusion, our realization of the mistake makes us feel that we should not have seen the object as a snake; but in hallucina- tion, it makes us feel that we should not have seen an object at all. So the existence which the object of hallucination possesses is not the 3 It will be said that the That is not the same as existence, as otherwise instead of "That is a snake" we shall have "Existence is a snake." Leaving out the Bradleyan view, according to which everything in the universe is a predicate of the Absolute, we should say that existence does not coincide with snake. But the That is yet exist- ence, determined demonstratively or perceptually, not conceptually. It does not raise the epistemological problem in illusion, but raises it in hallucination, because we question the very objectivity of the object of hallucination. It seems safer to say that the That is indicative of existential objectivity, not including in its import determi- nation by any essence in particular. To give it the meaning of existence can only be comparatively valid, that is, in illusion and true perception.</page><page sequence="7">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY 271 existence borrowed from the experiencer himself. It is difficult to say that this existence is mere psychological existence. For during the process of hallucination, the perceiver does not experience that he is voluntarily pic- turing the object as in imagination. The process is involuntary or, as in Kantian terminology, spontaneous. The object, unlike that of imagination is due to the spontaneity within our minds. And it is spontaneity that makes us adopt an objective attitude to the object. We have thus psychological existence as in imagination, which is outside epistemology; hallucinatory existence, which, though a result of spon- taneity within our minds and is therefore within the epistemological situa- tion, is to be derived from perceiver's existence; illusory existence, which, in all other respects, is like the hallucinatory, but is borrowed from the ex- istence of an object belonging to the common world; and the existence of true objects. When we realize our mistake in illusion and hallucination, the existence of their objects is just negated. Indeed we say that they did not exist even during the mistaken apprehension. We say also that they were perceived as existent. Further, we have another type of existence called mental or psychic existence. If we treat the illusory objects as non-existent or unreal, we shall have to say that imaginary objects also are non-existent or unreal. But we want to admit that they have psychic existence, thereby recognizing different kinds of existence. Then again, we wish to say that illusions and hallucinations have existence, but that it is false existence, not true ex- istence, true existence being the existence of objects that are members of the common world, that is, objects that can be interconnected according to laws called the laws of nature. It is not meant that in the history of our experience, we begin with a handy set of laws called laws of nature and begin constructing the common world. On the other hand, our experience starts with the immediacy of a common world, which is indeed not a material world either for the savage or the child. That what we see is matter and not a person like us is the so- phisticated assumption of the grown-up individuals and some philosophers. The anthropomorphic or personifying habit of the child and the savage goes against such an assumption, which has created the modern epistemological problem as to how we know other persons, and cut at the very roots of social philosophy by making the existence of other persons a conclusion based upon the weak analogy of one's own mind and its expression in bodily activity. Other persons also are as directly or as indirectly perceived as matter. In epistemology, the position of matter has no privileged posi- tion. On the other hand, both the child and the race start with the percep- tion of beings like themselves. What is perceived is not an "It" but a "You" or "He." But later criticism of their experience reveals that some of their</page><page sequence="8">272 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH perceptions are mistaken, that they are not of persons but material objects. To conclude from this criticism that everything perceived is material is as wrong as to think that it is a person. The same kind of analysis and criticism of our experience reveals to us that true objects are interconnected accord- ing to certain laws and that they can be classified into certain orders of being. We state with the immediacy of a common world, and through the discovery of the orders and their laws, our conception of it goes on de- veloping. III So far our discussion seems to indicate that existence is coterminous with experience and comprises both subjectivity and objectivity; and objec- tivity comprises both truth and falsity, falsity in its turn being divided into illusion and hallucination. Now, what are the conditions of the cer- tainty of existence at all these levels and how could we have contacted ex- istence? Wherever doubt is possible, ultimate certainty seems to be im- possible. Taking the object of imagination, imagination does not doubt whether the object imagined is its object or not. Here imagination of the object and the object imagined are one. Again, our sensation of pain and the pain sensed are one. Here also we do not raise the question of truth and falsity. We say such experiences fall outside epistemology.4 But here only have we certainty. One of the conditions of epistemology, a condition for raising the question of truth, is the divorce between subject and object, subject and predicate, and existence and essence. Where they are one, there is no possibility of falsity, and so no epistemology; and where they are distinct, there is always the possibility of doubt. Both in true and false perceptions, so long as my mind is going through the process of perception, that is, the activity of the senses, there is no divorce between existence and essence, and so no possibility of doubt. But when mind detaches itself from that process and the distinction between essence and existence sprouts up in it, it begins to doubt, if it feels like doubting. And when once the doubt is raised, so long as the distinction is retained, it can never be resolved. In practical life, we may brush it aside,5 but not theoretically. The actual proc- 4Pa n may be false in the sense that the physiological conditions may not be pres- ent, as in psycho-neurotic cases. But this example is only of secondary importance. There is yet this difference between the experience of pain and the experience, for instance, of color. We feel that color has an objectivity, is part of the objective order, but pain has being only so long as somebody suffers from it. In that sense, pain and its experience cannot be different. I It may be said that when there is no practical problem, there is no theoretical one also and so we are indulging in unnecessary hair-splitting. But none of the great discoveries even in science like gravitation or relativity was due to the urgency of practical life. And when we are attempting to formulate a theory of truth, our theory must be theoretically consistent, and we have no theoretical justification to say that we need not push our inquiry further even when theory needs to be carried farther.</page><page sequence="9">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY 273 ess of perception and of splitting up perception into existence and essence are two different moments of mind. The question of truth is relevant to the latter but not to the former. The Nyaya school in Indian Philosophy re- fuses to recognize indeterminate perception, in which the split into existence and essence has not occurred, as perception at all; for such a perception is non-relational and incommunicable and does not fall within the realm of truth and falsity. The impossibility of removing this doubt has tacitly been recognized by the criticisms of all the criteria of truth so far advanced. If the idea or es- sence corresponds to the object or existence, then it is said that it is im- possible for us to know this correspondence. If we accept the coherence view of truth, then to be certain of the pen in my hand, I should wait till my knowledge can exhaust the rest of the universe. If we adopt the usual pragmatic criterion, we have to meet the criticism that useful objects are often false and useless objects are true and that sometimes we have per- ceptions the utility of the objects of which can never be verified. In short, the view that we can never, theoretically, reconstruct objects with concepts, that no amount of conceptual integration can produce existence, ought to make us realize the impossibility of our task. Being cannot be reduced to concepts, ideas, or utility. Even idealists like Bradley and Bosanquet, who attempt to give us a conceptual reconstruction of the universe, admit that the world cannot be reconstructed without the "This" or immediacy, which means that the world we get cannot entirely be conceptual. But what else does the application of the criteria involve? They work with concepts, try to force existence into their conceptual formulas, reduce existence to es- sence; that is, they are attempting an inherently impossible task, the con- ceptual reduction of experience and existence.6 6 Can conceptual reduction be exhaustive? A concept is formed through the inter- relating of the subject of perception, the object of perception, and other objects with which the object in question can be related. And the number of concepts, therefore, that are relevant to the object in question would be infinite. Consequently, concep- tual reduction of any object would be impossible. (Within certain limits, we may compare the view to Whitehead's view of infinite hierarchy). But it may be asked: Have we not reduced the atom to electrons and protons? And thereby have we not reduced the concept of the atom into the concepts of its parts? But this analysis is done with a purpose; and any analysis done with a specific purpose may be adequate to that purpose. But for other purposes, the analysis may not be adequate. Further, we are able to reconstruct the atom with its parts and the concepts are therein helpful to us. But at higher levels of being like life and mind, even purposive analysis has failed, and we are not able to reconstruct a unity with its ultimate parts, which be- long to a lower order. The conceptual unity we attempt to reconstruct through inte- gration of parts being inadequate to living unity, the latter is destroyed when pressed into the former. To assume the possibility of an exhaustive analysis at the level of man, for instance, would violate the 1jantian moral principle that every man ought to be treated as an end in himself; for analysis is always with a purpose to manipulate.</page><page sequence="10">274 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Our knowledge cannot work without essences; that is why truth and falsity have relevance to it. It is true that, without reference to existence or assumed existence, the question of truth and falsity is, again, meaningless. Yet without essence, the problem does not arise. It is essence that raises the problem and existence that solves it. But when the problem is raised we are already in the realm of essence. Then how could we have known that there was existence? Now, our analysis of the problem of existence pushes the inquiry further. We naively start with the idea that determinate forms are themselves existences; but we are now obliged to draw distinctions and accept that determinate forms, about which we raise questions of truth, are essences. So we have the problem: How is existence known? Without existence, and with pure essence, truth is equally impossible. For a mere concatenation of essences, unless treated as existent, are neither true nor false.7 The existence of the object of imagination, while it is being imagined, is known through the very act of imagination. That is, existence is self-re- vealed. And the imaginary or psychic existence of the object of imagination is never negated. That is why, it is outside epistemology. Then is the ex- istence of the objects of hallucination, illusion, and true perception also self-revealed? One feels that existence, if known at all, must be known immediately and so must be self-revealing. At the moment we raise the question of truth, our mind has passed already from existence to essence. No one doubts at the very moment when the mind is fixed on the object of perception. Doubt becomes possible when mind is raised from existence to essence, when an object is perceived as determinate. One perceives a hallucination first, and then perception of a contradictory element in the perceptual situation brings doubt on to the scene, and one says that the object was not there at all, that one was mistaken in adopting an objective attitude to it, that the object in question was not connected with the ob- jective world in general. Similarly, in illusion, one negates the relation be- tween the predicate "Snake" and the subject "That." And in the case of true perception, when once the distinction between essence and existence is drawn in a perception like "That is a rope," the possibility of doubting 7 It is true that existence is not opposed to essence; otherwise, essence could not have entered existence. But yet the two are not the same. Essence is determinate, universal. Thought or reason is particularly at home in the realm of essence; but per- ception deals with existence also. The question of truth arises for thought in formal logic; and it arises for perception so far as it contains an element of thought and so essence. But pure essences by themselves, again, do not give rise to the question of truth and falsity; for they are all mere possibles. The question of truth is pertinent only when both essence and existence are taken together as directly connected as in perception or indirectly connected or taken for granted as in pure formal sciences, in which the truth of the axioms we start with is assumed.</page><page sequence="11">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY 275 whether the rope is true or false, whether it actually is connnected with the That or not, can never be completely removed. That is, the probability of the truth of the judgment becomes greater and greater, but never becomes theoretical certainty. If so, when do we have certainty? Only where the distinction between essence and existence is not drawn. That is, like ex- istence, truth, complete truth that is embodied and so is identical with ex- istence, must be self-revealing. The conditions for complete truth, where complete certainty can be had, lie beyond epistemology. In the case of imagination, though existence is self-revealing, one who imagines knows that mere psychic existence fades into nothingness and does not become part of that existence, which is truth also. Of course, com- plete truth and true existence must be identical. It will perhaps be objected that, when the conditions of truth and falsity do not obtain with regard to true existence, we are not justified in using the adjective true. But to differentiate existence that is involved in the perception of true objects from existence that is merely psychical, we need an adjective. There is a reason for not using the word objective existence. For if ex- istence is self-revealing what should be its nature? What is self-revealing can only be of the nature of self-concsiousness or self.8 Existence that is concerned with epistemology and has to do with the objective world must be self-conscious. If it is not self-conscious, it could not have been self-re- vealing. And if it were not self-revealing, we would never have known ex- istence at all. But we know existence, and therefore our immediate knowl- edge of existence is a necessary precondition or postulate of epistemology. Otherwise, we could not have spoken of existence. So existence, self, or self-consciousness is a necessary pre-condition of epistemology, not as the transcendental subject or object, but as self-conscious existence.9 So far as human experience can teach us, existence can never be bare existence or material blind existence, but self-conscious being. Material existence is only one division of objectivity or derivation from objectivity. It is one 8 It may be said that existence that is neither temporal nor spatial is not real. But thereby we would be placing a priori unnecessary and unreasonable limitation on open-minded thought and inquiry. We may as well say that as generally the location of color coincides with the location of objects, the colors otherwise seen are not seen really. In that case, the so-called film colors including the color of the sky will not be colors. Further, we would be excluding our very conscious being from the category of existence, as it is beyond time and space. Both space and time are its objects. I It may be asked: Why, if existence is self-revelatory, self-consciousness is not present in the knowledge of existence? It is now knowledge of existence that is in question. Knowledge as definite knowledge is not present without essence. We all think that we know existence. But when we attempt to test ourselves, we find that it is not found in perception even. Then how do we know it or how have we known it? It must have been self-revelatory. No determinate perception is knowledge of exist- ence; otherwise, doubt would not have been possible.</page><page sequence="12">276 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of the orders into which objectivity is articulated. Now, objective existence may be identified with one or all the orders of objectivity. But these orders are already orders of essences. And in the realm of essence, we are not cer- tain of truth, which is self-conscious existence. And in this self-conscious existence, there could be no diremption between subject and object; for if the subject is different from the object, essence sprouts up for the subject and self-certain truth or existence would be lost. Existence, even for epis- temology and as human experience discloses to us, must be inclusive of both subject and object, constitute their very core and be deep within them. And out of it should emerge the distinctions between subject and object, and existence and essence. This is what existence is from the human point of view. Matter or blind existence is a category expressive of an order which has meaning for human experience. It is not human experience that has meaning for matter. So we have no justification to deduce from matter or reduce to it human ex- perience. Our philosophy may prove that man evolved from matter: even this statement has meaning only for human experience. And we have no right to act as if we are nothing but material objects. For a criticism of our experience reveals other truths also. And epistemological consideration leads us to the conclusion that existence must be self-conscious, and that it should be inclusive of ourselves and our objective world. In our philosophy of life, this truth should play as important a role as the truth that we evolved out of matter plays. IV Now, another consideration needs to be made. We have thus worked with the idea that existence and truth do not coincide, for existence can be imaginary and psychological also. But the standpoint of philosophy must be the standpoint of true existence, though human. When we say that ex- istence must be self-revelatory, must be self-conscious, we are thinking of existence that is at the same time truth. Human beings can be aware of existence only if existence is self-conscious. But can this self-conscious or self-revelatory existence be known to human minds as 'other' than they? Then it would not be self-revealing but would be what is revealed to an 'other' than itself. So when in direct contact with existence, the human being must somehow be one with it. And the derivation of subjectivity must be a derivation out of this oneness. The individual's privacy or subjec- tivity must be a derivation out of this unity. Then are we not to treat subjectivity or psychic existence as a derivation out of true existence? Though we started with the idea that true existence is only part of existence, we now have to think that subjective existence is to be a later sprout out of true existence. Thus true existence holds, as if</page><page sequence="13">EXISTENCE: AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL STUDY 277 in a grip, both subjectivity and objectivity, that is, it is a unity of subject and object. Yet this unity, though including both the subject and the ob- ject, excludes not only false objects but also imaginary objects. The false and the imaginary can have no being in true existence. But when once out of this self-conscious true existence, the subject separates itself from the object; through the subject issue forth the false and the imaginary. And they have their meaning only for and through the subject. Thus though at the starting point, true existence, false existence, and psychological ex- istence seem to be three different forms of existence, in the end we feel obliged to treat the false and the psychological as derived from the true. It is not the aim of this paper to put forward a plea for absolutism or monism, though, if either is a true line of thinking, it would be in vain and perhaps harmful to ignore it. Professor Sheldon rightly says that every great system of philosophy expresses an important truth and future phi- losophy should take full advantage of the discovery.'0 The present paper is an epistemological discussion of existence, a consideration of existence for human knowledge and of the implications of the concept. It attempts to bring to light the conditions involved in the human awareness of existence and to show how our ideas of existence, truth, and subjectivity need a re- consideration in the light of these conditions. It shows also how the prob- lems of existence and of truth and falsity are approached from different points at first and how the concepts undergo reformulation at different stages of our inquiry; for it is the peculiar nature of philosophy that both its problems and the ideas that give rise to the problems need and allow constant reformulation as the inquiry proceeds.
