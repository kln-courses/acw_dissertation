<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE OF PREPOSITIONS IN 1 Q SEREK I.I. PRÉFACE In this article is reviewed the usage of the prépositions in 1 QS. (1) The prepositional phrase (2) is generally subordi nated to a verb, only very seldom to a substantive. I tried to expand the view by examining the S constructions also in other Q texts, but never touched those constructions that might occur in other texts but not in S. Thus the "corpus" remained always S. The discussed prépositions are: 1) the accusative or its facultative variant 'τ, 2) 'hry, 3) 'l, 4) 'τ (=with), 5) b, 6) btwk, 7) l, 8) LNGD, 9) LPNY, 10) MN, 11) ״L, 12) ׳M. The use of the prépositions corresponds often to the early and middle books of the OT, i.e. those that were composed before the Babylonian exile. These cases were not researched, but they were quoted in comparisons to the non-OT usages. The chapters (which are arranged according to the prépositions: acc, b, 'm, etc.) are divided into sub-sections according to the following criteria: 1) Innovations of S, i.e. those verb+preposition constructions which are not found outside the Q literature. (3) S (or Q) innova tions are quite numerous, especially those of the préposition b. Sometimes we may get the impression that the author, if he did not have a Biblical precedent for how to join a substantive to a verb, he chose b, which also in the OT has many functions. But he preferred in many cases b also when OT and Rabb. have other prépositions. 2) Usages identical with the later books (i.e. those composed after the Babylonian exile) of the OT. Constructions which appear in the later and the older books as well, were not taken into (1) Further abbreviated: S. (2) I.e. a préposition followed by a substantive or attached to pronominal suffixes ("conjugated prépositions"). (3) It was impossible in the frame of this article to discuss the problem if the innovation is really of S, or, if the construction appears also in other Q texts, of one of those texts.</page><page sequence="2">Y. THORION 406 considération. Only those late-book constructions were discussed, which have no parallels in the earlier ones. The frequent use of late OT constructions indicates some closer contact between the languages and styles of the two literature groups. 3) Constructions that are found in the Rabbinic literature. The likeness to the Rabb. language is not small, but one cannot say that its influence is dominant. 4) Constructions identical with Ben-Sira. These are very few and may be accidentai. 5) Aramaisms, not existing in the Hebrew OT and Rabb. (4) This occurs very seldomly, and it does not imply greater Aramaic influence than it is known in OT and Rabb. 6) Verb+prepositional-phrase constructions, though existent in OT and Rabb, but with différent meaning. Its relatively great frequency suggests perhaps that the author(s) stood in the diflîcult position of having to find lingual expressions for contents, which did not exist, or which they did not find, in the OT.

VI, 27; VII, 2.3.4) The Hebrew literary sources do not known the construction N'NS+acc. It is, possibly, the continuation of the usage niphal+ acc. of the OT, where it results, sometimes, from the conversion of active sentences into passive ones, e.g. mltm 't *rlt lbbkm (Deut. 10, 16) wnmltm 'τ bsr 'rltkm (Gen. 17, 11). In the OT there are active sentences with double acc. of the punished person and the punishment wy'ns 't h'rs m'h kkr ksp (2 Ch. 36, 3) (cf. T. LXV, 14). A sentence like this may seem in passive: wh'rs n'nsh m'h kkr ksp, the exact structure of the above Q sentences. (5) 2. yshh.. .,τ r'hw (S. VII, 4) shhshh has in the OT only the meaning of "dry".

It seems to be a contamination of an active sentence 'nSw 'wtw* with the passive n'n§ 't*. The proposai of WM (p. 111, note 79) concerning an object suffix seems improbable.

IX, 9) hzk occurs in the OT ( Job 9, 30), however without any com plement. Neither is Ηζκ+acc. found in other literary sources. The acc. is certainly analogous to the acc. complément of thr and the like. 4. WM§PTW ׳WKYH KN'WYTY (S. X, 6) TRWMT SPTYM HBRKNW (S. X, 6) ׳BRKNW TRWMT mws' έρτγ (S. X, 14). Ail these seem to be adverbial accusatives, more precisely instrumental accusatives. Adv. acc. occurs in the OT, (7) less in Rabbinical Hebrew, (8) but not instr. acc. Considering the nearly total absence of instr. acc. in the other sources and the highly frequent use of prépositions in S, especially the use of β for this purpose (9), this phenomenon is rather amazing. (10) 5. LHèYB 'nwh (S. XI, 1) *nwh is evidently an acc. of manner, not an object (b'nwh as it were), as it results also from the parallelism to brwh NéGBH. A similar combination occurs perhaps in Biblical Aramaic: htyb V wt'm (Dan. 2,14). 6. YèQWDW byhd 'τ §lySyt kwl lylwt h§nh (S. VI, 7) SqdSqd "to keep watch" is Old Testamental (Ps. 127,1), always without indication of the period. Here the period is indicated by means of 't. This may be a spécial Q feature, unless we suppose a common basis with the same construction wySqwd ,t hlylh in the relatively late book Josiphon. (11) 7. WYëraw 'lt (S. X, 2) Because of the difïiculty in understanding the word 'lt, it is impossible to define its syntactical function. If it is a substantive, it is subordinated as acc. (like Ps. 18, 12; 104, 20).

It happens, however, that in a relative clause beside the verb brk there is no rétrospective pronoun. Thus one may suppose that the "means" of the blessing stands in acc., e.g. '§r brkk yhwh 'lhyk [Deut. 12, 7, also 15,14). This facultative omission is caused by the understanding of the context, as it occurs also with other verbs, e.g. hnn ( Gen. 33, 5; always with b), bhr (Num. 16, 7; always with b) and others. Only in one OT passage is there a vague hint to the expression of the means of the blessing by acc. wybrkk brkwt îsmym, etc. ( Gen. 49, 25), but the passage is difflcult to under stand and one can hardly draw any conclusion from it.

IV, 2) In the OT the root phd occurs in Qal and Piel as an intransitive verb "to be afraid." As transitive or causative verb, Hifîl is used (Job 4, 15), also in Rabbinic Hebrew (NumR., Section 16). phd in Piel as causative verb is not found either in OT or in Rabb.

(13) The combination of hskyl with an acc. of person appears in the later OT books only: lhskylk bynh (Dan. 9, 22; cf. Ps. 32, 8; Neh. 9, 20). More Q occurrences H.

Another Q occurrence is perhaps Hf V, 11. (14) 11. 11. lhbyn ysrym (bd't 'lywn) (S. IV, 22) whbynhw bkwl msptymspty hyhd (S. VI, 15) lhbyn wllmd 't kwl bny 'wr (S.

But in the causative sense, with two objects, it can be found in the later books (or chapters) only (Jes. 40,14; Ps. 119,27.34; Dan. 10,14; Neh. 8,9J. This phrase is rather common in Q: Sa I, 5; Hf XV, 4.5; CD XIII, 5.8; 4 QpNah II, 4; 4Q Dib.Ham. II, 17. (12) It occurs, however, psh phd bty msrym: the Pessach frightened the houseshouses of the Egyptians in the relatively late composed Piyut (liturgical hymn) psh ,klw phwzym of the first Pessach night (in Machazor Babba, Eshkol Edition, Jerusalem, p. 21). It is difficult to décidé if the two passages are accidentai, independent from each other, or else a common linguistic base has survived in them. (13) See N°» 10 and 52. (14) According to wm (p. 27) whkmt (S. IV, 22) is connected backward with lhbyn as an object, second to bd't 'lywn, though the préposition β omitted; while lhîkyl tmymy drk constitutes a new sentence. But S. IX, 20 considers also WM (p. 36) including a double acc. In the OT HSKYL+acc can also mean: "to be successful in something" [Deul. 29, 8).</page><page sequence="5">409 THE USE OF PREPOSITIONS IN 1 Q SEREK 12. y§yb 'τ r'hw (S. VI, 26) lh§yb 'y§ 't md'w l'st hyhd (S. VI, 9) H§YB-}-acc. (of person) can be found ail over the OT. But while in the earlier books the full expression is hSyb ,t plwny dbr (1 K. 12, 9), in the later books dbr may be omitted (Job 35, 4) (15). Concerning S. VI, 9, there is a possibility to interpret jt md'w not as "his fellow" but "his knowledge." (16) Considering the folio wing l'st hyhd this second possibility seems even more reasonable. 13. lhwkyh d't 'mt wmspt sdq lbwhry drk (S. IX, 17). The meaning of hwkyh is close to lymd, hskyl, hbyn and subordinates two objects: the person (by means of l) and the material (by acc.). This construction is possibly identical with lhwkyh mlym (Job 6, 26; 13, 15). More occurrence, with the change of the word order is H. XVIII, 12. c. Rabbinic 14. y'br dbr mtwrt mwsh (S. VIII, 22) 'br in Qal+acc. is frequent in the OT (Jos. 7, 11; Jes 24,5; Dan.Dan. 9, 11). Consisering the "plene" spelling in S, y'br is preferably a Piel. This verb-form with an acc. is found in Rabb. Hebrew only l'br ,t hdyn. (17) d. Différent meaning 15. mspty sdq lw' hzq (S. III, 1) The meaning of the verb (18) is "to fulfill, mantain." In this meaning the root occurs in Q more frequently in Hiphil (S. V, 1 CD.CD. III, 12; etc.). In the OT hz q (Piel)+acc. means "to streng then, make stronger" (Jes. 54, 2). Only 2 Ch. 29, 34 resembles our passage, though not identical with it. WM (p. 24) connecte mspty sdq backwards to g'lh as its second object, while lw'hzq, "he is unable" (?!), opens a new sentence. Because of the bad condition of the text, one cannot say with certainty whether whzqthwhzqth hwqyk (H. XIV, 5) belongs here or not. 16. LQRW׳ BSPR WLDRWâ M§PT (S. VI, 7) The combination dr§ m§pt is of OT origin (Jes. 1,17; 16,5), however it means there "to claim justice." This OT meaning does not fit into the context here. The Q members interpreted DRâ in its Rabbinic meaning, i.e. "learn and inquire" theThora. (19) (15) It is interesting to compare the two parallel passages 1 K. 12, 16 (with dbr) with 2 Ch. 10, 16 (without dbr). (16) So WM p. 30. (17) See Yalon, Studies p. 82; idem, Introduction p. 202-203. (18) It is impossible to determine if it is Qal or Piel. (19) Jasthov Dicl. I, p. 325, Levy, Wôrl.

WM (p. 34) under stands: "they shall study the rule which runs" and, according to WM here begins a quotation of some written law. Yet, 'sr in the function of a semicolon, or such a drastic abbreviation to 'sr, seems hardly acceptable. 18. ysyg mwsr (S. VI, 14) Nowhere occurs the expression hsyg mwsr. In the OT hsyg cornes with acc., but only in the meaning "to reach" (Gen. 47, 9). The closes OT expression for this idea uses the verb lqh: hlw' tqhw mwsr (Jer. 35, 13). Surprising is the chiastic parallelism in Sir. 35, 14: dwrs 'l yqh mwsr wmShrh ysyg m'nh. 19. WRYB ׳NSY SHT lw' ׳TPWS (S.

Upon whom the klh is brought is expressed by the prépositions: 'τ (Jer. 5, 18; 30, 11, etc.) or Β (Jer. 30, 11; 46,28), never after 'hry. From the other side, the verb pqd never subordinates either the subst. klh or the préposition 'hry. The combination itself, of the verb pqd with the subst. klh, is also exclusively Qumranic. It occurs twice in CD. VIII, 2; XIX, 14, but without 'hry. pqd with 'hry appears only in S. II, 6. This use of jhry is analogous to verbs like rdp 'hry. (21) b.

Maybe S. is another case of interchanging between ,l-'l. (22) But it is also possible that there is semantic différence between lS'l *l:'l .ns'l ,l 'sh signifies to be asked to express opinion about something, while n§'l 'l mspt signifies to be asked to come to the court, to the judicial process. b.

LHBYN WLLMD ׳T KWL BNY ׳WR BTWLDWT KWL BNY ׳YS (S. III, 13) The préposition Β after llmd is not necessarily an attraction after hbyn b.

Β with this meaning I have not found either in other Q passages or in the OT or Babb Hebr. (27) WMWM (p. 25) translates by introducing several verbs: emanate, come, be caused. It is not impossible that the case reflects some kind of interchange (lingual, not scribal) between b-m, because the first example (S. III, 19) has a m parallel : wmmqwr hwsk twldwt h'wl.h'wl. 29.

The two possibilities are not the same. The background sentence of the first is: "somebody causes, by means of showing God's judgments, that a man's heart feels fright." Of the second: "somebody causes that a man is afraid of God's judgments." In the second possibility m, instead of b, is expected. (29) (25) See N° 56. (26) Ν" 32.

In Q hbyn has also the meaning "to instruct, teach." (35) and it can subordinate double object. The first of it, the person who is instructed, stands in acc. The second object, the material instructed, is introduced by b. This is analogous to the construction of hskyl. (36) 33. lw'hh§bw bbrytw (S. V, 11) hh§bw seems to be defective spelling of Hophal. The root h§b in Hophal does not occur in any other place, even the parallel active Hiphil is found first in the writings of the médiéval Bible interpreter Rashi. (37) The use of b is apparently analogous to nhSb (S. V, 18) and hthsb (S. III, 4) which subordinate b. (38) kh§ (cf. khS Le υ. 5, 21) or to k's (always with 'l or 'l, never with b).

The prepositional phrase bmqwm has the rôle of "whence," not of "where," therefore, instead of b, is expected mn. (39) According to the OT usage the verb signifies "to move away", not "to fail," and there is not enough reason to change the basic meaning. (40) WM (p. 103) supposes scribal error between b-m or influences of a pervious anacoluthon. But the same construction occurs once more, in CD XIII, 2-3, so we cannot sup pose just scribal error or corrupted text. 35. wqrbhw b'sh 'l py hrbym (S.

VI, 22 lqrbw lyhd.lyhd. 2) The β is of the mood or the circumstance: "through consultation." But in this case there would come about a redun dent overlapping with the following words 'l py hrbym. 36. wlw' yt'wh bkwl 'sr sw[hw] (S.

R. s. 51, Ex. B. s. 24), never with b. The Piel form in OT subordinates acc. (Mi 7, 1, Ps. 21, 10), in another place in Q a l: wlhwn hms l' t'wh npsy (S. X, 19). The préposition b is used here, presumably, analogous to other verbs with similar meaning, as rsh, which in the later OT books is sometimes constructed with b (Hag. 1,8;2 Ch. 29, 3), also in the Mishnah (Pess. 111,2, Ned. III, 1, Sanh. VII, 10, etc.). Another factor can be the immediate text surrounding, where b is used frequently. Line 23: bkwl, 24: bw, bndbh, 25: [wbkw]l. 37. HWQ HRWT BLSWNY (S.

(44) It is noteworthy that the verb ntr does not subordinate any object in the OT, on the other hand 'p (in the meaning of anger, wrath) serves frequently as subject in expressions like hrn 'pw, but as an acc. only in the later books (Ps. 15, 1; 24, 14; 29, 8; Job 36, 13; 40,24). (45) 39. lw' 'nhm bnk'ym (S. X, 21) The expression cornes parallel with lw' 'rhm 'l. From this parallelism (46) one may understand nhm in the meaning "to comfort" as it is common in the OT. But in the OT and in Rabb Literature nhm subordinates acc., never the préposition b. This is an innovation of S., and it is difficult to realize the reason. (47) 40. WYNHYLM BGWRL QDWÛSYM (S.

In the OT the idea is expressed by hnhyl-[-double acc. or nhl (Piel)+B [Deut. 3,28; Num.Num. 34, 29). In the Rabb.

This construc tion occurs also in the Yer. Talmud ns'nym bbhmh ( Yer. Bets. V, 63a). b is used more frequently in H (IV, 36; VII, 18; X, 17; XI, 32), whereas in other texts 'l is usual (S.

For this idea OT uses usually, also in the later books, n'sh l (Ex.(Ex. 2, 4, Num. 15, 34, Esth. 6, 9). n'sh β in this context is found only in Esth. 2, 11: mh y'sh bh. The active forme 'sh β is quite frequent in Q (pH IX, 2; S. V. 2; CD. VIII, 11, etc.). WM disconnects bw from n'sh, and understands the préposition as β of the means, as a rétrospective pronoun in a compound nominal sentence: "everything which is done, by thaï he will be accep ted, etc." But considering the following phrase wzwlt rswn 'l lw(') yhps, which seems to be parallel to the previous, the joining of n'sh with l is preferable to WM's proposai. 43. LHSKYL BKWL MHSBT QWDSKH (S. XI, 19) hskylhskyl is a transitive verb meaning "to comprehend, to under stand." The verb has this meaning in the later OT books, and it governs an acc. wkl drkyw l' yskylw (Job. 34, 27, also Deut. 32, 29), or the préposition 'l: lhskyl 'l dbry twrh (Neh. 8, 13). In Dan it governs b, like in our passage: lhskyl b'mtk (Dan 9, 13) hskl β kl spr whkmh (Dan 1, 17). The same rection of β occurs also in H. XII, 30; XIII, 14. c. Rabbinic 44. kyrstw bgwrl 'wl (S.

(49) Another fragmentary occurence ]mtrmh β[ (H. XVII, 7) does not contribute to the semantic solution. In the OT rmh cornes in Piel, with the acc. of the person cheated (Jos.(Jos. 9, 22). In the Midrashim Piel subordinates b, rmyt b'byk (Gen.(Gen. R. 85,9). Also the Aramaic of the Targum translates rmh 'τ with mrmh β (Ps. 26, 19). These extrabiblical lingual usages caused probably the very combination of the prep β with YTRMH.YTRMH. By the way, the two Q usages are not necessarily identical. (50) The relation between them may be as in wkhS b'mytw bpkdwn (Lev.(Lev. 5, 21), i.e. the first describes the person cheated; the second, the material, the sin. e. Différent meaning 47. LW׳ Ls'wD BKWL ׳HD MKWL DBRY ׳L (S. I, 13) If we disregard the local meaning of s'd β in the OT (Ps. 68, 8), so the meaning of "transgress the Law" (51) is specific to S, and it even seems illogical, because one would expect a préposition expressing distancing, like mn. (52) It occurs however in the scripts of the 9th century Saadia Gaon. (53) 48. b'yn tmymym lw' ythsb (S. III, 4) hthsbhthsb β occurs in the OT only once (Num. 23, 9) in the meaning "to be considered as one of (an ethnical group)," which cannot fit here because of 1yn. We may understand yth^b as standing absolutely, meaning "to be considered as worthy, venerable." (54) In this case β does not indicate the group to which the person belongs (here does not belong); β would indicate the people (or group) who (does not) appreciate him. Yalon (p. 80) reads 'wn'wn which can signify also "joint." He interprets this passage as hthsb 'm (S. III, 1) meaning "he does not join the perfect." This is also difficult, because the verb ythsb enters hardly into the frame of the sentence. 49. kwl 'sr lw' nh§bw bbrytw (S.

In this meaning I did not fmd yd" β in any other non-Q sources. 51. lhnhwtm bd'h (wkn lhskylm brzy pl') (S. IX, 18) hnhhhnhhhnhh β in the OT expresses place (Gen. 24, 28), mode (Ps. 78,14) or means (Ex. 13, 21, Ps. 73, 24). WM (p. 35) translates "with knowledge," i.e. a modal b. But in the light of the parallel passage lhskylm brzy pl' it seems to be β of the object. hnhh β in this meaning does not occur either in other Q texts or in the OT or Rabb. Literature. One may suppose an analogy to lhskylm b. 52. lhskylm brzy pl' (S. IX, 18) lhskyl rwknym blqh (S. XI, 1) hskylhskyl as a causative (57) verb subordinates two objects, the second of which is preceded by b. (58) To this usage I did not find parallels in the OT or in Rabb.

In S. the use of btwk (instead of miwk) is quite absurd. (55) nhSb l H. III, 24; XVIII, 26 is identical in meaning with NHëB β of Jes. 2, 22. (56) In this sense yd' β happens also in other Q-texts H.

WPQWDT KWL HWLKY BH LMRP׳ (S. IV, 6) WPOWDT KWL HWLKYHWLKY BH LRWB NGyVm (S.

It does not appear in a clear verbless clause, but also through the verbal clause reflects the verbless structure. In wsmty pqdtk slwm (Jes. 60, 17), the verb smty subordinates a double acc. pqdtk Slwm, that may form together the verbless clause *pqdtk slwm. In this OT passage in reflected thus a prepositionless structure, *pkwdt mrp', *pqwdt. .. RWBRWBRWB NGY'YM. Other synonyms (mws', swp, qs, tws'h) do not construct verbless clauses. Only one synonym, tqwh, builds that structure, again without a préposition before the predicate: wktkwtm mph nps (Job 11, 20). The verse yrwslm w'mk lhrph lkl sbybwtyw (Dan(Dan 9, 16) is somewhat similar because of the général structure and the l preceding the predicate, but is also différent, because the subject is not taken from the semantic fîeld of destiny, but is a proper name. As aforesaid, there is no analogous structure in the OT, nor in Rabb. Literature. It came about, probably, as a latent analogy to clauses, which include verbs as hyh l, hpk l, nhpk l 10 change intointo (GB, yhh, 5, 1). b. Late OT books 59. wl'st mh ybyn (S.

Another way of expressing "to understand" is by means of hbyn l (H XI, 28; CD. II, 14), hbyn 'l (CD. I, 10). In the OT hbyn l, "to understand," occurs in the later books (or in later sections) only, as wtbn lh (Job 13, 1, also Ps. 73, 17; 139, 2; Deut. 32, 29). (65) c. Rabbinic 60.

With the rection ns' pnym l is found in the Rabb. Litera ture only ns'w lw pnym b'wlm hzh "God turned His face towards him in this world ( Yoma 87a). The use of l is perhaps an Aramaic influence, where the préposition ,L does not exist, only l.

LQRBW LYHD (S VI, 22) In the OT krb in Piel is rather rare and governs 'l only (Ez. 35, 17). The idea is expressed chiefly by Hiphil, but also that governs 'l (Ex. 28, 1). A Piel with the same meaning as above and governing the préposition L is Rabbinic: mqrbn ltwrh, "bring them near the Torah" (Aboth I, 12). In addition to S. VI, 22, the root qrb appears in Q as follows: Piel with 'l (S. VI, 19), Qal with l (S. VI, 16.19; M. VIII, 7; X, 2.3) and 'l (CD V, 9.14; 6 Q D II, 2) Hithpael with l (M I, 10). Maybe these rections influenced also in the direction of qrb l. 62. lmspt 'l ysph tmyd (S. IX, 25) ysphysph allows to read Qal and Piel as well. Here the rection is l and the meaning neutral, neither positive nor negative. In the OT sph l (Qal) has negative meaning to lurk (Ps. 37,32), sph β is neutral to watch (Ps. 66, 7). In Rabb Hebrew sph l (Qal) is neutral (as. S. IX, 25) hkwl swpyn l'Sn hm'rkh (Yoma 21b) sph l (Piel) is either negative ml'ky hblh mspym lw l'dm (Ber. 51a) or neutral hmsph lskr ,stw (Pes. 50a).

But in ail these passages 'l has not the meaning through, by. ׳L="through, by" occurs twice in Q, 'rsm smmh 'l 'wybyhmh (4Q DibHam. V, 4) through their enemiesenemies (77) and perhaps also w'l 'hd lhbdyl thrh (CD. IX, 23) by by the ( witness ) of one person. b. Late OT books 73. wns'lw hkwl 'l dbryw (S. VI, 16) ys'lw hrbym 'l dbryw (S. VI, 18; VII, 21) wlw' ys'l 'l kwl 'sh (S. VIII, 25). ns'l 'l signifies 10 be asked concerning something. The verb ns'l governs with the same meaning also other prépositions: L (S. VI, 4.9; CD. XIV, 6) and ,l (S. VII, 21). The older OT books use s'll (78) [Gen. 32, 30; Deut. 4, 32; 2 K. 8, 6; Jer. 6,16 but also Job Job 8, 8) while in the language of the later books, written during the Second Temple period is found s'l 'l (Jes. 45, 11; Eccl. 7, 10; Νeh.Νeh.Νeh.Ν eh. 1, 2). 74. wlw' yswb 'wd 'l 'st hyhd (S. VII, 2) swb governing 'l occurs only here, while with other prépositions is more frequent: 'l (10 times), l (6), 'd (once). In the OT swb (76) In S.

Rabbinic 75. w'l hrbym lw' ywsy'nw (S. VI, 20) hwsy' ... 'l signifies to spend money on. Rabbinic is here not the section itself, but its meaning. hwsy' ksp 'l is Biblical and it means to dislribuie the expenses among (2K. 15, 20). For to spend spend on the OT uses (perhaps) hwsy' ksp l, as in wywsy'whw lhr§ h's (2K. 12, 12), but it can be understood also in a physical sense, i.e. the silver was taken out from the treasury and given the craftsmen. In Rabb. Hebrew hwsy' ksp 'l is unequivocal: to spend money on something: κκ wkk ksp hws'ty 'l dyrh zw so manymany denarii I spent on this dwelling (Sabb. 150b, cf. Ket. VIII, 5). 76. 'l sggh ,ht n'n§ §ntym (S. IX, 1) The construction n'ns 'l is Rabbinic: 'l dbr zh n'nS m§h [Sanh.[Sanh. 8a). (79) 77. ׳YN ׳HR ZWLTKH LHSYB ׳L ׳STKH (S. XI, 18) hsybhsyb 'h means here apparently not simple to answer to but to oppose,oppose, to be against. In the OT hsyb "l means: 1) to answer to (Hab.(Hab. 2, 1), 2) to retaliate against (2 Sam. 16, 8; Ps. 94, 23), 3) to cause (water) to inundate (Ex. 15, 19). In the Rabbinic Literature HèYB *l has the significance of to oppose, to appeal against some thing:thing: nknsw 'rb'h zqnym lhSyb 'l dbryw "four old men (=sages) entered in order to appeal against his words ( Yer. Gitt. IX, 50a; BabliBabli Gitt. 83a). (80) d. Ben Sira 78. WHNM ׳D SLWS p'MYM ׳L MW§B ׳HD (S. VII, 11) The verb (?) hnm is unclear (HNM=he who falls asleep?) and therefore also the function of ׳L is not quite clear. But in any case ׳L (+N\vSB=session) expresses continuity in time during, in the course course of, which is expressed in S. VII, 10 through b: w'sr y§kwb wysn BMwëB hrbym. In the meaning during, 'l is found in Ben Sira Sira Sira 'lmsthyyn during a wine feast ; Sir. 35, 5b; 49, ld. Temporal ,l is found also perhaps in the following passages: hmwld 'sr hw'h ylwd lyw (׳LYW=during the month) (4Q 186 (=Hor.) fr. 1, col. II, (79) But may be also that 'l is not governed especially by n'nS, but expresses a cause, which is Biblical (Num. 18, 32) and occurs also in Q (H. III,III, 33, CD. IX, 8).

In Biblical Aramaic the infinitive verb form governs 'l: lbqr' 'l yhwdyhwd (Esr. 7, 14). The participle mbqr, as title of the supreme inspector of the sect, appears also in CD, but its rection is not 'l but l (CD. XIII, 7.13; XIV, 9; XV, 8) or β (CD. XIII, 16) (unless the β is a local complément.) f. Différent meaning 80. ׳YN LS'WD ׳L ׳HD MKWL DBRYW (S. III, 11) Similar to s'd β (S.

This prepositional government might have come about on the analogy to the équivalent *br 'l (H. XII, 24). (82) 81. WYQM ״L NPèw BëBW'T ׳SR (S. V, 8) w'èR YQYM BBRYT ׳L NP§w (S. V, 10) The expression hqym 'l np§w signifies here (83) to vow, to commit oneselfoneself to do something. In the OT hqym 'l (without nps) comes either in local sense [Jos. 7, 26) or to make king of (a folk) (1 K. 14, 14). In connection with a vow hqym (without 'l) signifies to confirmconfirm somebody's vow (Num. 30, 14). This usage of hqym 'l (np§w) is spécifié to the Q texts. Outside of Q the idea is expressed by hqym l in Sir. 44, 21: b§bw'h hqym lw lbrk. L. 'M a. Exclusive Q construction 82. lhtrwbb 'm 'n§y hIht (S.

We can only guess how this rection came about: either through the influence of other verbs of quarrel, as nlhm 'm, rb 'm; or else as a misinterpretation of constructions like sn'tw ,wtm [Deut. 9, 28); sn't yhwh 'wtnw (Deut. 1, 27), in which the Q members might have understood ,wtm-'wtnw as derived from 'τ (=with).

Late OT books 85. w'm ΒΝΥ Û5MYM HBR SWDM (S.

"m ySrym lw' ythSb (S. III, 1) hthsbhthsb in the same meaning (to be reckoned with) subordinates in the OT the préposition b: wbgwym l' yth§b (Num. 23, 9). This construction occurs also in Q: b'yn tmymym lw' yth§b (S. III, 1). nh§b (with the same meaning) governs in the OT 'm: nhSbty 'm ywrdyywrdy bwr (Ps. 88,5).

The verb in this meaning appears only here, and the rection of 'm derived from the concrete meaning. (85) See also 1 Κ. 20, 25; 22, 7; 2 Κ. 3, 11 and more cases in Jer. and Ez; cf. the Grammars.

In the chapter which deals with the punishment of the members of the group (S. VI, 24-VII, 25) the construction N'NS+acc. (i.e. an acc. after a passive verb) is frequent. The acc. describes the size of the punishment (n'ns snh 'ht or the like) (no. 1). There is one case of acc. of manner. (lhsyb 'nwh) (no. 5). There are also three cases of instrumental acc. (no. 4). The occurrence is very particular because of its rarity in the other Hebrew literary sources. In two cases (nos. 38, 39) S uses the prepo sition b, where the OT uses an acc. Here belongs perhaps also no. 30, but it can be explained also in a différent meaning. 2. New verb-preposition governments, analogous 10 synonymous verbs. Some of the new constructions can be explained as analogy to other verbs with similar or identical meaning, which appear in Q, OT or other Hebrew literature. The analogy can be based on verbs derived from the same root, or on verbs with similar meaning, but derived from différent roots. In the following list, the first verb-preposition construction is the discussed one of S; the construc tion after the colon is that which influenced S. The number in parentheses indicates the paragraph in which the construction is discussed. (OTL=the late books of the OT) ACC.ACC. PHD LBBW: HPHYD + aCC. (OT) (8); hzkw drkm: THR + aCC.

Nominal (verbless) sentences 1 Q S 1 Q S employs very frequently verbless sentences. Two types of them do not occur, probably, outside of the q literature. In the four cases of no. 28 (which come densely in S. III, 19-23) the nominal predicate, preceded by b, expresses the source, the origin of the subject. In the two cases of no. 58 (come also closely one to another in S. IV, 6.12), the nominal predicate, preceded by l expresses the "destiny," the "fate" of the subject. 4. Aramaism The Aramaic, which was the spoken language in the period of Qumran has great influence on the Hebrew of the Q texts. (87) The Aramaic influence is perceptible also in the later books of the OT, which were written after the Babylonian exile, and in the Rabbinic language. In this article, aramaistic phenomena, which appear also in the OT and the Rabbinic literature, are not defined as aramaisms (they are treated in the sections: Late OT books, Rabbinic language). As aramaisms were dealt with only those phenomena which are not found in OT and Rabb. literature, and those are quite few. The use of the verb SHH+acc. is borrowed from the Syriac (no. 2). The government of 'l by the participle mbkr is Biblical Aramaic (no. 79). mtrmh β is either an Aramaic structure or influenced by synonymous verbs (no. 46). 5. Constructions with two separate meanings. The accusative construction drS mspt is Biblical. But in S. it appears twice not in the Biblical sense. The meanings are différent not only in comparison to the Biblical usage, but they differ also one from the other (no. 16, 17). Also ytrmh β in its two occurrences (no. 46) has slightly différent meanings. 6. Double meaning Some verb+prepositional phrase constructions we can unders tand in two ways, and it is difïicult to décidé which one fits more the text. These double meanings occur only with the préposition b, whose usage is exceedingly wide in S (perhaps in Q, too). The equivocal constructions can be explained either as objective or adverbial: lphd b (no. 29), lh'yr b (no. 30), krb b (no. 35), ntr b (no. 38). (87) See Kutscher, Language, p. 23 fi.</page><page sequence="26">Y. THORION 430 7. Free or misinterpretation of Biblical expressions The Biblical phrase drs m§pt occurs twice, in two différent meanings. In no. 16 in the Rabbinic meaning. The text of no. 17 is obscure, but it is clear that the usage is différent. The phrases of 'nwh lpny (note 72) and £mmh ,l (no. 72) make free use of the Biblical components. sn' 'm (no. 83) can be a misinter pretation of the Biblical sn' ,t, but one can suppose as well analogy to synonymous verbs. 8. Difficult passages. The verb ykhs (note 29a) and the substantive (?) 'lt (no. 7) are lexically unknown. The components of bs'wn r§' mhrsw (note 29b) are taken from a Biblical passage, but the new arrange ments of S are unclear. Also wg'wlym b§wbtw (note 29c) is not clear. Among the innovations of S there is a relatively great number of new usages of the préposition b. In four cases β is not only ununderstandable, but also strange and amazing. In no. 29 lphdlphd β is mn awaited, but still there is a possibility to understand it in another way, where β can fit the context. But in the three cases m§ bmqwm (no. 34), ls'wd bkwl 'hd (no. 47), lstr. .. btwk (no. 53), the préposition β is contrary, according to our understanding, to the intention of the text, and we would await mn. But considering the quadruple occurance, we cannot just call it an error, though an explanation to the phenomenon I cannot offer. 9. List of multi-governments. Here follows a list of verbs which in S can subordinate more than one préposition, in the same or différent meanings. If the prepositional government is discussed in the main part of this article, the number of the paragraph is given beside it in parentheses. For those I tried to give some occurrences from other β texts as well. Verbs, which in S govern more than one préposition, ail of them after OT use (and not just from the later books)—for which reason they are not discussed in the main part—are also listed (e.g. kpr, ht'rb).
