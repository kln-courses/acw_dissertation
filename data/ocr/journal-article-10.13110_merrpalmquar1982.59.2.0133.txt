Uttal  Northwestern University  The development of conceptions of evolution is a problem of both great practical  concern and important theoretical interest. Many Americans do not understand  basic principles of evolution, such as natural selection, and part of the reason  may be that these concepts are notoriously difficult to learn and to teach. The four  contributions in this special issue all investigate the development of conceptions  in evolution. Several of the articles focus on the interaction between children’s  prior beliefs and their interpretation and cognitive construction of evolutionary  concepts. For example, essentialist beliefs (e.g., Gelman, 2003) may affect how  children understand and interpret natural selection and the evolution of species.  The four articles all demonstrate that prior beliefs constrain and influence how  children and adults interpret what they observe and are taught about evolution.  Taken together, the articles demonstrate the importance of taking a developmen- tal approach to understanding the development of conceptions of evolution. The best basic research often focuses on problems of practical or societal  concern (e.g., Medin, 2012; Stokes, 1997). For example, major advances  in understanding the psychology of attention grew out of the very practical  needs that arose in World War II from the introduction of radar as an early  warning system. The topic of this special issue—the development of con- ceptions of evolution—is another good example of the reciprocal benefits  for basic and applied work that can derive from working on real, practical  problems. The practical problem in this case is obvious and extreme: Many  Americans, perhaps the majority, either reject evolution outright as an  explanation for the origin of species or are unsure whether evolution is  correct.

Here, we focus on another  possible reason for American’s rejection and misunderstanding of evo- lution: Evolutionary concepts, such as natural selection and phenotypic  variation, are notoriously difficult to learn and teach (see Evans, 2001;  Scott,  2005). Evolutionary change can rarely be observed directly, and  people often have great difficulty reconciling their initial ideas about how  species change with formal teaching about evolution. A central premise that guides most of the articles in this special issue  is that the perspectives and methods of developmental psychology can shed  light on why these topics are so difficult to learn and to teach. For example,  evolutionary change will often involve conceptual change, and develop- mental psychology has made great strides in understanding the nature of  conceptual change and how it can be influenced. We know from decades  of research that concepts are cognitive constructions; they emerge through  an interaction between the concepts that the child already has and what he  or she observes or is taught. Concepts cannot be directly put into children’s  heads; they are integrated with an influence (e.g., diSessa and Sherin, 1998;  Vosniadou &amp; Brewer, 1992). At the same time, the field of developmental psychology benefits  greatly from studies of the nature and development of concepts of evolu- tion. All of the articles in this special issue shed light on fundamental  issues of interest to psychologists and education researchers, such as  the following: What does it mean to say that someone has a concept,  and what do we make of variability in understanding and application  of that concept. How does visual-spatial thinking influence concep- tual development? How, when, and why should students’ concepts be  challenged? How do children integrate new information with what they  already know? More specifically, most of the articles deal with the relation between  children’s essentialist beliefs and their reasoning about concepts related  to evolution (e.g., Gelman, 2003, 2004). The essentialist bias manifests  as a tendency to view living things in terms of inherent, unchangeable  characteristics that are present at birth and passed on from parents to  child. This bias is termed essentialism because the child focus is on  the essential, enduring properties of the organism. For example, in the  classic “switched at birth” paradigm (e.g., Springer, 1996), children are  asked to reason about a pet or other animal that is born to parents of one  kind but raised by parents of another. Young children’s answers almost  MPQ 59.2_01.indd   134 14/04/13   10:10 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> Introduction to the Special Issue 135 always favor the influence of the biological parents. Young children may  incorrectly attribute the causes of changes to the organism even when the  environment would offer a better explanation. As Shtulman and Calabi point out in this issue, essentialist assump- tions may make it very difficult for children to understand some of the  most important concepts of evolutions (see also Gelman &amp; Rhodes, 2012).  Natural selection happens at the level of individual members of the species,  and hence variation within individuals is the most important factor in natu- ral selection. Believing that inheritance is the passing of an essence seems  diametrically opposed to understanding that natural selection operates at  the level of individuals. Several of the articles in this special issue deal  with the complex and fascinating interaction between children’s essential- ist beliefs and their understanding of evolutionary information. Synopsis of the Four Papers Shtulman and Calabi assessed the effect of taking a college-level biology  course on students’ understanding of evolution and its mechanisms. The  pretest and posttest assessments included not only measures of what stu- dents knew but also how the information was organized cognitively. Their  specific focus was on whether students were transformationists or varia- tionists. Transformationists believe that one species changes in another in  response to environmental demand. Variationists, in contrast, understand  that natural selection operates on variability across individuals within  a species. Variability is thus essential to natural selection. Shtulman and Calabi assessed six different aspects of students’ under- standing of evolution: variation, inheritance, adaptation, domestication,  speciation, and extinction. Patterns of responses across these six sets of  questions revealed both which set of beliefs students held and whether the  beliefs were strongly consistent across the different kinds of questions. For  example, a strong variationist would tend to give coherent answers across  all six sets of questions, all of which appealed to ideas of variability and  natural selection of phenotypic traits. The results were intriguing. A surprisingly high number of the students  held (incorrect) transformationist beliefs, even after the class. Overall, biol- ogy class instruction was only modestly successful in addressing miscon- ceptions. However, the class did lead to changes among a particular subset  of students: Those who were both inaccurate and consistent in this inac- curacy across the different questions. This is a counterintuitive finding; the  students who were most consistently wrong and hence held the strongest  transformationist beliefs were the most likely to change their conceptual  MPQ 59.2_01.indd   135 14/04/13   10:10 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> 136 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly models of evolution. This finding is very important for both basic research  and its application to teaching; it strongly suggests that personal theories  of evolution are most amenable to change when they are coherent, perhaps  because the new information contradicts so strongly with existing beliefs. The article by Legare, Lane, and Evans demonstrates the importance  of language in the development of children’s conceptions of evolutionary  conception. Evolutionary change is not easy to describe, particularly to  young children. To help, adults often cast evolution in anthropomorphic  terms, such as suggesting that biological entities have a conscious desire  to change. For example, they may talk about finches wanting to change  their beaks to be more effective in foraging for different kinds of seeds or  about dinosaurs evolving into birds because the dinosaurs wanted to fly.  As the authors point out, these anthropomorphic references could conceiv- ably facilitate understanding because they provide a tractable metaphor to  understand an unobservable change. However, anthropomorphic language  also might reinforce misconceptions of the nature of evolutionary change. To test the effects of anthropomorphic language on children’s under- standing of evolutionary change, Legare et al. told children three stories  about three different birds. One of the stories used anthropomorphic lan- guage, describing evolution in terms of the birds’ desire to change. The  children also heard two other stories that emphasized different (possible)  mechanisms of change. One was the correct explanation, in that it explained  change in terms of natural selection. The third explanation focused on  needs. For example, the story emphasized that a bird’s beak evolved from  small to large because of a change in a food source; the bird needed to  change its beak to obtain the new food. The stories were randomly assigned  to be about the three different birds, so the effects are not due to the char- acteristics of one particular bird. The researchers included a variety of measures. One of the most inter- esting was simply having children recall and retell the stories. Of course,  none of the children remembered the stories exactly, so coding what words  they used and what information they emphasized provided insights into  how they thought about evolutionary change and the influences of the dif- ferent stories on children’s comprehension. The results indicate that the language we use matters: Anthropomorphic  language—casting evolutionary change in terms of a desire to change—led  to significantly more explanations and memories that focused on specific  desires for change. Both the natural selection and need-based stories led to  improved understanding of the nature of evolutionary change. Legare et al.  suggest that need-based language could be a scaffold that helps children  not to think in anthropomorphic terms and to focus instead on the relation  MPQ 59.2_01.indd   136 14/04/13   10:10 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> Introduction to the Special Issue 137 between environmental change and evolutionary change. Once again, we  see that basic research leads to important implications for education, and  that studying an educationally relevant question leads to better research. The article by Herrmann et al. also investigated the effects of an inter- vention on people’s thinking about evolution, but in this case, the par- ticipants were young children and the intervention was less formal than  Shtulman and Calabi’s intervention. Herrmann et al. investigated how chil- dren integrate transformative biological events with their prior conceptions  of biological changes and with essentialist beliefs. Children must learn  about a variety of different biological changes, and reasoning about these  changes may be critical to understanding evolution. Some changes involve  only growing larger but maintaining a similar form; a puppy growing into  a dog is a good example. But other changes are much more dramatic; the  metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly, for example. In their first study, they asked 3-, 4-, and 7-year-olds to assess whether  different kinds of change were possible, as well as about the causes of pos- sible change (e.g., magic, biological transformation, growth). For example,  children were shown a picture of a puppy and then a picture of an adult  dog or adult cat. They were asked whether the puppy could turn into a dog,  and whether it could turn into a cat. Likewise, they were shown a caterpil- lar and a butterfly and asked whether one could change into the other and  to explain why (or why not). Children of all ages tended to reject changes  that violated their essentialist beliefs, such as species change (e.g., puppy  to cat). However, the younger children also were more likely to reject the  possibility of transformative biological change, such as a caterpillar chang- ing into a butterfly. In their second study, Herrmann et al. allowed children to observe  a  transformative change. Terrariums containing caterpillars were placed  in the children’s classrooms, and the children watched as the caterpillars  made cocoons and transformed into butterflies. Herrmann et al. then tested  children’s reasoning about these and other kinds of biological and nonbio- logical changes. The performance of the children who observed the meta- morphosis was compared to that of a control group that was tested twice  but did not experience an intervention between the two testings. Observing the caterpillar-to-butterfly metamorphosis did lead to more  acceptance not only of this change but of other dramatic biological changes,  such as a tadpole changing into a frog. Nevertheless, the scope of the  increase was limited. The children did not accept, for example, the sugges- tion that a puppy could change into a cat. The refusal to generalize across  species shows that essentialist beliefs constrained the scope of the infer- ence that they made from observing the metamorphosis. Witnessing this  MPQ 59.2_01.indd   137 14/04/13   10:10 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> 138 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly transformation may actually have reinforced essentialist beliefs because  children could now think of the caterpillar and the butterfly as sharing  a common essence. A puppy and a kitten do not have a common essence,  and thus one could not change or evolve into the other. Thus, learning  more about biological change does not replace essentialism but does alter  what kinds of changes children think are possible. These findings may be   helpful to teachers or museum directors because exposure to transforma- tive changes is a very common intervention in early childhood education. Finally, the article by Ainsworth and Saffer is a bit different from  the others in that it does not emphasize preexisting beliefs or conceptual  change. Instead, these researchers investigated elementary-school chil- dren’s understanding and learning of evolutionary concepts from visual  representations. In this case, the visual representation is the cladogram,  which depicts the evolutionary or cladistic relations among species. The  term is derived from clade, which refers to a group of organisms that are  believed to have evolved from the same common ancestor. Cladograms  facilitate reasoning about descendancy—they show how closely one spe- cies, or family, or class (depending on the depth of the representation)  resembles another.  Cladograms often resemble branching trees, as they  may begin with a common ancestor (the trunk) and then branch out. These  sorts of graphs, and what they represent, are so important in evolutionary  biology that tree thinking has become a central focus on research on evolu- tion education and related terms (Baum, Smith, &amp; Donovan, 2005). Ainsworth and Saffer’s results clearly show that children can learn from  cladograms. With practice and instruction, they could deduce relations of  species, particularly common ancestry. These results are particularly inter- esting in light of recent research that has stressed the difficulties that adults  can have in using these representations cladograms (Catley &amp; Novick, 2008;  Novick, Shade, &amp; Catley, 2011). Ainsworth and Saffer’s results indicate that  it may be possible to begin instruction at an earlier age and hopefully avoid  some of the difficulties that adult students experience when using clado- grams. In addition, even though their article’s focus was different than that  of the others, their results are quite consistent with the general idea that  new information about evolution both reflects and changes the conceptual  understanding that children bring to these tasks. Conclusion The articles in this special issue demonstrate convincingly why evolution is  so difficult to learn and to understand: It is not always easy to reconcile evo- lutionary change that contradicts some of the most fundamental and universal  MPQ 59.2_01.indd   138 14/04/13   10:10 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> Introduction to the Special Issue 139 beliefs that people have about inheritance and what members of the same  species share in common. After all, the fact that Darwin’s theories were seen  as so revolutionary is evidence that they were not easy to accept. Moreover,  all of the articles point to important new ways to address the incongruence  between evolutionary change and essentialist beliefs. For example, the  articles indicate that we need to think carefully about the language that we  use when talking to young children and about how they react to observing  a metamorphosis. Finally, the articles clearly demonstrate the benefits that  developmental psychology can gain from working on important, real-world  problems. It may be time to abandon the false dichotomy between basic and  applied research. References Baum, D. A., Smith, S. D., &amp; Donovan, S. S. (2005). The tree-thinking challenge.
