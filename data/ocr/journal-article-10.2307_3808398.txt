<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Deer of North America. By Leonard Lee Rue, III. An Outdoor Life Book, Crown Publishers, Inc., New York. 1979. xiii + 463pp. $12.95. Writer, biologist, photographer-a rare combina- tion. Yet, that perfectly describes the author, Leon- ard Lee Rue, III. Fortunately, he has taken time to document and illustrate his talents, experiences, and knowledge in "The Deer of North America." I recommend the book to anyone interested in wild- life. And who isn't? The book represents what one would hope for, and expect, from a zealous person who has spent most of his life "living" with, and astutely observ- ing, the most popular big game animal in North America. In addition to telling the "deer story" in an informative and easily-read manner, the author commendably expresses his broad philosophy of wildlife management and conservation, using deer and other game animals to exemplify his philoso- phy. Certainly, this book is one of the best illustrated texts available on deer. Nearly every aspect of the deer's life and habits are superbly displayed by professional-quality photos, several in color. The author generously uses personal experiences to relate what the deer are like, how they behave, and how they respond to management. Many small details about the deer, often overlooked by the ca- sual observer, add to the book's interest. In essence, the book is the culmination of many years of keen observation and dedicated study by an ardent wild- life enthusiast. The book is logically organized into 3 parts. Phys- ical characteristics and behavior are discussed in Part I. Here, the author is at his best in describing his perceptive observations about deer. Probably because of his long and intimate association with deer, the author tends to ascribe anthropomorphic powers to deer, even to the point that ". . . some deer have more reasoning ability than we give them credit for." The author somewhat belabors his dis- cussion of some physical characteristics; for exam- ple, 33 pages are devoted primarily to deer weights. Part II tells how the deer acts and manages to survive throughout the year. All aspects of the deer's life from conception, to birth, to maturity are discussed with benefit of the author's observations and experiences. Here, he makes several state- ments that border on speculation and are lacking or vague in documentation. Some examples are: "Red squirrels pick poisonous mushrooms but hang them up in the branches until the poison leaches out of them"; "Dry leaves of oaks, elms and hickories are seldom if ever eaten because of the tannic acid they contain"; and "Deer instinctively select the food with the highest protein." A wide range of management policies and prin- ciples are discussed in Part III. The author does an excellent job of presenting the case for hunting to control deer populations. He rightfully deplores political chicanery and makes a logical plea for en- J. Wildl.

Some readers likely will disagree with the au- thor's statements about habitat management prac- tices. For example, "clear-cutting large blocks of timber or pulp ... creates excellent habitat" may not be true in the long run. Many will argue that selective cutting in small tracts would be more ap- propriate in a multiple-use forest. The author's con- tention that timber cutting is too light over much of the deer's range may be questioned by many en- vironmentalists who think the cut is too heavy. Too, most foresters maintain that controlled fires should seldom, if ever, be used in hardwood timber stands. The author's discussion on census and its impor- tance in deer management may be somewhat mis- leading. First of all, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate deer count, especially in forests of the southern and eastern United States. A census based on track counts and pellet drop- pings can be quite unreliable. Too, many state wild- life agencies contend that deer condition, repro- ductive rate, antler development, harvest rates, and habitat condition are more practical guidelines for herd management than deer numbers. An appendix includes a list of plants favored sea- sonally by deer and a table that shows deer popu- lations and harvests for the 1975-77 hunting sea- sons. The plant list does not include scientific names, thus the specificity of some is unknown. The absence of literature citations in the text makes for easy reading. For the most part, text ref- erences can be tied to publications listed in the bib- liography.-LOWELL K.
