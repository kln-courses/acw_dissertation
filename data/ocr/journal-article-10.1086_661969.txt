      <p>For Donald Judd, in both his artistic production and criticism, there was no criterion more important than credibility. Judd outlined his artistic project, what could be called his aesthetics of credibility, in an essay entitled “Specific Objects.” In this oft-cited text, published in 1965, Judd argued that by forgoing two-dimensional media such as painting and by eschewing recognizable imagery, the artist was able to create works of art free from any preexisting taints of meaning so that they might appear as real and immediate as any other object in the world. Such objects would thus avoid what he called “the problem of illusionism” and could consequently transcend what he saw as the discredited tradition of European culture founded on universal humanist—in Judd’s terms, “anthropomorphic”—principles. In Judd’s words: “Because the nature of three-dimensions isn’t set, given beforehand, something credible can be made.”<sup>1</sup> Drawing on his long-standing interest in British empiricist philosophy and its precepts regarding the sensory basis of knowledge, Judd argued for an aesthetic ideal in which a work of art that renounced illusionism and familiar imagery would initially produce perceptual confusion and uncertainty that would ultimately be resolved—and made credible—by a viewer’s scrupulous (and perhaps skeptical) investigation of it through the senses.<sup>2</sup> Judd applied this aesthetics of credibility in his own art through three principal means: nonhierarchical (i.e., geometric and mathematically based) compositions; unconventional materials, which were frequently industrially fabricated; and abandonment of any aesthetic borders such as pedestals for his floor pieces or frames for his wall-mounted works. For instance, in an untitled work from 1963 (frontispiece) constructed of painted plywood and Plexiglas, a square form measuring approximately four feet on a side is “divided diagonally to a depth half its height” (as Marianne Stockebrand has described it) and placed on the gallery floor, thus asserting its physical presence as an object within the viewer’s literal space.<sup>3</sup> By removing the familiar signifiers of aesthetic experience, Judd sought to forge a new mode of perception that was more credible, more real even, because it was unmediated by preconceived notions of what a work of art should be.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Such credibility was something that Judd not only brought to his own art but also recognized as a valuable asset in the art of others. Throughout his early criticism, which appeared primarily in the journals <italic>Arts Magazine</italic> and <italic>Art International</italic> during the early 1960s, he reserved this adjective for the art he most admired. He called Barnett Newman’s “openness and freedom … credible”; Robert Rauschenberg’s sculptures “credible and strong”; and, perhaps most ardently, Lee Bontecou’s wall reliefs “credible and awesome.” (Slightly lower on Judd’s scale of aesthetic merit is the term “convincing,” which he used more frequently than “credible” but usually regarding work he deemed of lesser quality. One might say that within Judd’s critical lexicon, “credible” and “convincing” were analogous to more traditional terms of aesthetic judgment like “beautiful” and “admirable.”) Judd also used the term negatively, to condemn the legacy of European modernism, which for him suggested the outdated tradition of easel painting, with its accompanying principles of composition. He noted that artists working in that mode need to “present some credible alternative,” asserting in the essay “Specific Objects” that “[Piet] Mondrian’s fixed platonic order is no longer credible.”<sup>4</sup> For Judd, credibility was not simply a function of material presence or the denial of figurative associations but fundamentally a historically grounded factor, one in which different moments called for different strategies of credibility. Deliberately impersonal and unconventional, Judd’s art sought to foil humanistic notions of interpretation, expression, and composition, which, according to him, had largely defined artistic practice since the Renaissance yet had become obsolete, irrelevant, and unbelievable in the post–World War II cultural landscape. In the place of this anthropomorphic tradition, he endorsed an art of unprecedented immediacy, which encouraged scrupulous empirical judgment over historical precedent as a model of moral, political, and philosophical existence.<sup>5</sup> This central aspect of Judd’s art resonated with the anxiety caused by the Vietnam War in the 1960s, when the “credibility gap” between the government’s official presentation of the war and its reception within the media led to a growing suspicion and distrust among many citizens of the United States.</p>
      <p>Judd was trained as a painter and printmaker, and many of his earliest sculptures preserve a certain degree of traditional artistry, both in terms of manufacture (by the artist’s own hand) and materials (such as cadmium red oil paint, composition board, and wood). Yet just as the artist attempted to diminish signs of authorial intervention within these early works through simple, geometric compositions and factureless, uniform coats of paint and to increase their material presence by eliminating bases, Judd incorporated nontraditional objects—such as sections of pipes, a baking pan (embedded flush into a painted board of wood; fig. 1), and, in the case of the untitled work from 1963, a rectangular plane of colored Plexiglas—to enhance his works’ nonfigurative and nonallusive visual quality or, in the terms of his aesthetic theory, their credibility. Because these materials offered a surface that required no additional alteration (as he put it, the “color is embedded in the material”), they were exemplary agents in his project to make an art of material specificity and compositional lucidity. As Judd became more financially successful and was able to realize his aesthetic goals more fully, he drew more on nontraditional and especially industrial materials such as aluminum and stainless steel and, to a lesser extent, polished brass and plywood as a means to downplay the handcrafted aspects of his work. In 1964 he would further forgo the authorial hand by having small industrial firms fabricate the work according to his designs.<sup>6</sup>

      <p>If Judd’s art established its credibility in its material presence, made evident in his use of nontraditional art materials and rejection of recognizable imagery and conventional modes of display, many of the artist’s earliest critics found the works perhaps too credible in their apparent allusions to everyday objects. Writing in 1964, one reviewer described Judd’s art as “resembl[ing] storage units of an unidentifiable kind,” while another declared that the artist’s 1968 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, looked like a “science-fiction warehouse” filled with “gleaming hardware.” In tandem with these insinuations that Judd’s artworks were little more than things, critics and dealers (but notably not the artist) gave many of his early works colloquial monikers as a way to identify them, such as “record cabinet,” “Kleenex box,” “bleachers,” or, in the case of the untitled work from 1963, “step.” Intentionally exhibited as art objects occupying the same physical space as other objects and people in the world, Judd’s works, with their nontraditional and occasionally sleek and unembellished “science-fiction” materials, seemed to allude to automobile bodies or domestic appliances rather than to most sculpture of their time.<sup>7</sup>

         <title>Specific Objects in a Spectacular Society</title>
         <p>These nonart and occasionally commercial connotations of Judd’s avowedly impersonal and specific objects suggest not only how his artistic project corresponded with the contemporaneous practices of artists associated with pop but, more significantly, how both strands of artistic production confronted the already burgeoning commodity culture of the 1960s.<sup>8</sup> The nearly simultaneous arrival of both pop and minimal sensibilities, especially in the New York art world in the early 1960s, reflects more than a coexistent engagement with the influence of mass culture, whether it was with industrial materials or advertising. Rather, both styles addressed what was seen as the increasingly spectacular, which is to say image-ridden and visually manipulative, nature of U.S. culture in the 1960s, a state of affairs trenchantly diagnosed by Daniel Boorstin in <italic>The Image, or What Happened to the American Dream</italic> (1962). Although probably best known for the coinage of the term “pseudo event” to describe an event whose primary purpose is to be seen and reported on, Boorstin’s book more generally addressed the correspondence between what the author saw as an unprecedented increase in visual information in postwar society and the rise of an illusory and even deceptive component of everyday life—not only in such an expected realm as advertising but equally in politics, journalism, and interpersonal relationships. “Now, in the height of our power,” wrote Boorstin, investing his language throughout with a tone of impending danger, “we are threatened by a new and a peculiarly American menace… . It is the menace of unreality. The threat of nothingness is the danger of replacing American dreams by American illusions.” In the final pages the author presents the frightening prospect of a world in which the real can no longer be distinguished from the false. “More and more accustomed to testing reality by the image, we will find it hard to retrain ourselves so we may once again test the image by reality… . We must discover our illusions before we can even realize that we have been sleepwalking.”<sup>9</sup> This image world, in which the boundaries between the public and private spheres of experience (as well as the commercial and the political) melt away under the pressure of rampant commodification and technological mediation, is powerfully evoked in an exemplary pop work like James Rosenquist’s <italic>F-111</italic> from 1964–65 (fig. 2). Employing the scale of billboards and the pictorial vocabulary of print advertising, Rosenquist’s painting, especially as it was originally installed wrapping around three walls in the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York, presents an unsettling and overwhelming vision of metamorphosis in which imagery of commodities evidently taken from advertisements uncannily fuses with an immense fighter plane. In such unsettling passages as that in which a heap of Day-Glo spaghetti transforms into what appears to be a swatch of fabric (possibly bedsheets, as sleek and monochromic as the actual aluminum panels from which the pasta materializes) and then explosively tumbles out of a mushroom cloud both doubled and sheltered by a multicolored umbrella (which is itself echoed in the reflective missilelike dome of a hair dryer atop a small girl’s head), Rosenquist offers a surreal and particularly martial dreamscape in which modern technology and new industrial materials such as aluminum and chrome constitute both the deadliest of weapons and the most benign, if nonetheless alluring, commodities.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>If Rosenquist’s work addresses the blurred relation between people and things in an overly commodified and technologically mediated world, Judd sought to produce objects that could transcend this confusion, albeit in the autonomous sphere of aesthetics. In this regard, the horizontal plane of purple Plexiglas in Judd’s work of 1963 (see frontispiece) provides an illusionistic (and technologically redolent) passage similar to the morphing forms Rosenquist painted on reflective aluminum panels. The sensuous, reflective surface of Judd’s plastic stands out from the rest of the object’s matte cadmium red exterior, declaring itself as the key passage in the work and presenting the beholder with a visual conundrum: Is the vague triangular form seen on the surface of the Plexiglas the reflection of the lower triangular form, or is it a view through the translucent material into an interior space, exposing part of the square base that supports the uppermost triangular form? As the conventional account of Judd’s art (and minimalism more generally) has demonstrated, the answer can only be arrived at by approaching the object and checking one’s visual sensations with one’s changing position in relation to it.<sup>10</sup> Such perceptual skepticism is rewarded with enlightenment, revealing that what one sees is in fact a reflection, a very convincing natural illusion (as opposed to artificial illusions like representational imagery) and a quite mesmerizing one—like the ripples seen on the surface of a tree-lined lake—able to hold the viewer’s interest for an unexpectedly long time. It could be argued that if pop art diagnosed the symptomatic excess and confusion of a culture of spectacle, minimal art like Judd’s sought a possible cure. Critical of traditional painting and sculpture that purported to be representations of things in the world, Judd instead sought to create “specific objects” that aspired to be nonreferential things in themselves. In a world of rampant commodification and media overload, Judd’s art would furnish a space of perceptual credibility.<sup>11</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Because these works resisted traditional modes of aesthetic appraisal, they created anxiety in many viewers who did not know how to approach them. Situated within the actual space of the beholder rather than the idealized space of the pedestal or frame, the works offered themselves not as aesthetic objects for optical delectation but as real physical presences that impinged on the viewers’ spatial awareness.<sup>12</sup> Many of Judd’s critics found his work “aggressively physical,” “disconcerting,” “threatening,” and even “belligerent.” Judd himself acknowledged that the industrial materials he valued for their “obdurate identity” also contained “aggressive” qualities. Critics often couched their descriptions of his works in explicitly martial metaphors. For instance, one writer noted how “the massive, four-foot cubes” of “shining” steel that Judd showed at his Whitney retrospective in 1968 “are marshalled into strictest alignment.” Another reviewer of the same show provided a colloquial designation for one of Judd’s works by referring to the protuberances of a four-pronged work as “knuckles” (fig. 3).<sup>13</sup>

         <title>Minatory Minimalism</title>
         <p>The recurring associations between Judd’s aesthetic project of credibility and the perceived aggressiveness of his work follow a pattern in the broader reception of minimal art in which the works were characterized using terms of violence and force.<sup>14</sup> Reviewing the landmark <italic>Primary Structures</italic> exhibition of 1966 at the Jewish Museum in New York, one of the first shows to present a representative body of minimalist art to the public, the critic for <italic>Time</italic> magazine described certain sculptures (presumably those of Ronald Bladen) as “tilt[ing] like huge destroyer smokestacks” and noted the “aggressive and sometimes playful” nature of the art in the show. One of Judd’s contemporaries, Walter De Maria, exhibited a work called <italic>Bed of Spikes</italic> in 1969 made of 153 upright 11-inch obelisk-shaped spikes (fig. 4) that were described (again in the pages of <italic>Time</italic>) as “honed to the sharpness of a Viet Cong punji stick.” Judd himself invoked such metaphors when commenting on the work of Lee Bontecou in a 1965 review, commending its “minatory power” and pointing out that it has to be viewed “with puzzlement and wariness, as would be any strange object, and at most seen with terror, as would be a beached mine or a well hidden in the grass.” In his “Art and Objecthood” of 1967, undoubtedly the most famous essay on minimalism, Michael Fried stated that “there is a war going on between theatre [his term for the kind of literal art practiced by artists like Judd] and modernist painting.” Throughout the polemical essay, Fried invokes a passionately combative tone, describing the “survival” of modern painting as a “conflict” in which objectlike works like Judd’s must be “defeated.”<sup>15</sup>

         <p>In another foundational text of minimalism, Annette Michelson’s catalogue essay for a 1969 retrospective of the work of Robert Morris, an artist perhaps only second to Judd in embodying the minimal movement in both his passionate writings and wide-ranging artistic practice, the author suggests how the anxieties of war infused the critical reception of minimalism. Writing about an untitled work from 1965–66 constructed of a gray plywood circle with two bands of fluorescent light emanating from opposite sides (fig. 5), Michelson describes how Morris’s artwork energizes the space around it, arguing that such a spatially engaged artistic project exhibits a certain relevance to everyday life. She demonstrates this point by citing the “prolonged debates over the design of the table and seating arrangements which preceded the opening of the current ‘peace talks’ in Paris, as reported in the <italic>New York Times</italic> during December 1968 and January of this year.”<sup>16</sup> A diagram of proposed tables for the negotiations between U.S., South Vietnamese, and North Vietnamese delegates, published in the <italic>Times</italic> on December 14, 1968 (though not included in Michelson’s essay), suggests how these spatial concerns found a strikingly similar materialization in Morris’s work and the minimal aesthetic more generally (fig. 6). The underlying political and specifically war-related content of Morris’s work during this period is most evident in <italic>Crisis #2</italic> (fig. 7), one of thirteen such images. Here Morris used characteristically minimalist tropes of formal reduction and negation of ostensible content literally to obliterate the subject of military violence. Morris roughly occluded the information given by the headline of the <italic>New York Post</italic> from Monday, October 22, 1962, announcing the alarming state of affairs brought on by the Cuban missile crisis, covering the text in the same gray paint that would become the artist’s signature color for his pieces a few years later.<sup>17</sup>

         <p>While it is understandable that the growing prevalence of war (and the threat of war) would permeate the critical discourse of various cultural spheres with references of these kinds, many artists, including Morris and Judd, were at certain moments in their careers actively involved in the antiwar movement. A more direct, if complex, correspondence between the martial metaphors associated with minimalism and the artists’ biographies can therefore be posited. Judd’s undeniable awareness of the issues surrounding both the Vietnam War and nuclear weapons arguably allowed the artist to channel such anxieties in his work, however unintentionally. Recently art historian David Raskin has argued that Judd instilled his own vaguely anarchist (and consequently antiwar) politics into his artistic production through the visual sensitivity that his works engender, encouraging viewers to approach the world in a heightened state of skepticism and self-reliance.<sup>18</sup> In the summer of 1968, while an artist in residence at the Aspen Center for Contemporary Art, Judd published a full-page announcement in the <italic>Aspen Times</italic> calling for an end to the war in Vietnam as well as a renewed commitment to civil rights in the United States. That fall he participated in a benefit exhibition at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York to raise money for the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. The artist’s most explicit antiwar statement, written in 1991 in response to the U.S. invasion of Kuwait and revealing his distrust of military power, declared, “Almost no one in the United States has said that for fifty years the country has been a military state and that the ‘Cold War’ was, as it is again, a situation devised to maintain that military state.”<sup>19</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Yet despite the artist’s ardent antiwar stance, it could be argued that war marked both Judd’s first experience with construction and design when, as a member of the Army Corps of Engineers between 1946 and 1947, he supervised the erection of prefabricated buildings in Korea, and his culminating artistic project, the establishment of the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas. Using land that had earlier been occupied by Fort A. D. Russell, a U.S. Army base with artillery sheds, an aircraft hanger, and barracks, Judd redeveloped the base into a tightly controlled, ideal setting for the display of art (fig. 8).<sup>20</sup> Although Judd claimed that the site’s previous military existence could hardly be deemed an architectural (let alone an ethical) virtue, he nevertheless allowed signs of the buildings’ history to remain unaltered, as can be seen in the German words, directed at the prisoners of war who were brought to the camp, stenciled over the exits of the artillery shed, prohibiting entry by unauthorized persons (fig. 9).<sup>21</sup> More significant, the oftentimes nontraditional and industrial materials Judd used to forge what he saw as a more credible art, coupled with the elimination of framing devices and use of serial composition strategies (evident in the multiple variations of equally sized aluminum boxes displayed in the Chinati artillery shed), invested the works with what many viewers considered threatening, aggressive, and even inhuman qualities. Judd’s pursuit of a more credible art, while ostensibly situated within the autonomous realm of aesthetics, nonetheless resonated with one of the central social and political concerns in U.S. culture at that time. For the concept of credibility, besides being a cornerstone of Judd’s art and aesthetic theory, was closely associated not merely with the war in Vietnam but with global nuclear war.<fig id="fg9" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>The Credibility Gap</title>
         <p>Credibility was a key word in the “new frontier” of the 1960s. If in 1962 Boorstin diagnosed what he saw as the increasingly deceptive nature of everyday life in a mediated and commodified world, a world in which, as he put it, “‘truth’ has been displaced by ‘believability,’”<sup>22</sup> by the second half of the decade the discourse surrounding credibility was no longer directed only at commodities and celebrities but also whole institutions, technology, and the fate of life on Earth. The central place of credibility in terms of such weighty matters was manifested in one of the definitive terms of the period. In a special issue of <italic>Newsweek</italic> in July 1967 devoted to the escalating military predicament in Vietnam and its domestic consequences, the authors invoked a common phrase to summarize the social crisis brought about by the divisive feelings engendered by the war. “More than anything,” they wrote, “Vietnam has made Americans question their fundamental assumptions about themselves and their country. In the jargony shorthand of the mid-1960s, the problem is distilled into a single, cryptic phrase: the credibility gap.”<sup>23</sup> The phrase “credibility gap” had entered the lexicon of U.S. politics the previous year as the nation’s increased involvement in Vietnam led many people to discern the drastic divergence between the administration’s generally optimistic assessment of the war and the usually gruesome images daily brought into homes via television and newspapers.<sup>24</sup> While the shared nomenclature of Judd and the U.S. media need not insinuate any direct causal relationship, it does imply how the artist’s work operated within the broader cultural concerns of the moment, addressing some of the most pressing national anxieties. If the credibility gap between the reality and the mediated representation of the Vietnam War produced a growing sense of mistrust and unease among many citizens, Judd’s credible art, with its aggressive connotations and rhetoric of industrial and technological objectivity, was able simultaneously to assuage if not temporarily mend the gap felt to be pervasive in American culture at large while at the same time (if largely unintentionally) figure the very basis of the anxiety that grounded his artistic practice of material specificity and credibility.</p>
         <p>The credibility gap of the Vietnam War was genealogically linked to earlier gaps in Cold War discourse, such as the “bomber gap” and the “missile gap” of the late 1950s, which expressed in material terms the competitive arms race between the United States and the USSR. These gaps found their frightening resolution in October 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis. Following this event, U.S. citizens confronted the staggering realization that a nuclear conflict could readily bring about not only the total destruction of the two embattled nations but, just as likely, the entire world population.</p>
         <p>Once the United States had confronted its worst fears about nuclear war, coming as close as it ever had to its actual realization and in the process recognizing that to engage in such a war was to engage in a no-win operation of total annihilation, Washington sought a foreign policy that suppressed the possibility of nuclear war by transferring the competition between the superpowers away from each other and toward arenas in which they could clash without recourse to the bomb. To forestall further full-scale nuclear engagements with the Soviets, new spheres of competition were constructed in which each country could present (and more particularly perform) its credibility. Along with the space race and the continued, if clandestine, nuclear brinkmanship, the war in Vietnam became a crucial component in this campaign of credibility: a conventional, limited war in which the two superpowers could meet and demonstrate their power and determination without recourse to nuclear weapons. This doctrine of credibility was often couched in such theories as the domino effect, which argued that if the United States showed lack of resolve when one small country was threatened by communism, it would lose its international credibility if called on to stave off further attacks. According to this strategy, which historian Jonathan Schell calls the “unvarying dominant goal of the foreign policy of the United States” between 1961 and 1974, the real crisis of nuclear war could be successfully avoided only by the creation of unreal and largely symbolic crises, of which the communist threat in East Asia was the most visible and persistent example. According to Schell, “What the strategists of the Vietnam war had always most feared was not the reality of defeat but the appearance of defeat, and what they most wanted in Vietnam was not victory but victory’s image.”<sup>25</sup>
         </p>
         <p>But an unbridgeable paradox existed within this logic and found its ultimate breaking point in the Vietnam War. For to acknowledge the theoretical or even theatrical nature of such military actions would inherently invalidate their manifest rationales and in turn expose the lurking atomic unease underpinning this policy of deterrence. In fact, the widening of the credibility gap corresponded to the expansion of the nuclear arms race, a phenomenon recognized as early as 1957 by Henry Kissinger, who as Study Director in Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy at the Council of Foreign Relations wrote, “As the power of modern weapons grows, the threat of all-out war loses its credibility… . [W]hatever the credibility of our threat of all-out war, it is clear that all-out thermonuclear war does not represent a strategic option for our allies. Thus a psychological gap is created by the conviction of our allies that they have nothing to gain from massive retaliation and by the belief of the Soviet leaders that they have nothing to fear from our threat of it.”<sup>26</sup>

         <title>Irreconcilable Paradox</title>
         <p>Judd’s aesthetic of credibility, founded on a faith in the undetermined and impersonal capacities of nontraditional and industrial materials in art making, contained its own irreconcilable paradox whose logic in many ways paralleled the contradictory tensions motivating the credibility gap within American culture more broadly. While deliberately eschewing any form of visual illusion (in that they do not represent something beyond themselves), many of Judd’s works, through their reflective surfaces, shadowy recesses, and translucent materials, nonetheless include instances of lived or perceptual illusion produced by their factureless and perfectly tooled surfaces.<sup>27</sup> As Richard Shiff has recently noted, Judd associated such perceptual or real optical illusions with scientific repeatability in that the artist believed each viewer would experience the same optical illusion similarly. Despite the artist’s avowed assertion of the empirical objectivity of such perceptual illusions, many viewers, especially in the 1960s, found this aspect of the works both crucial and disconcerting in that it seemed to contradict Judd’s aesthetics of credibility and the objective rhetoric of his chosen materials.<sup>28</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Within the nebulous reflections and shadowy spaces of Judd’s otherwise specific objects resides a forbidding doubt as to whether such seemingly objective materials (because of their frequent connotations of industrial production and technological precision) could indeed transcend the variable and unreliable realm of human action and perception and, in addition, whether such transcendence was even in the best interest of mankind. For instance, the burnished brass surfaces of an untitled stack from 1969 (fig. 10) seem to puncture any sense of geometric stability engendered by the work’s rigid rectangular structures, presenting the reflected environment as soupy, very nearly psychedelic swirls of colors and shapes. The crisply defined edges and corners of the uncompromisingly self-evident materials offer a beholder no perceptual place of rest. Similarly, the towerlike space cumulatively formed by the stacked units, powerfully illuminated by a crimson glow produced by light passing vertically through translucent Plexiglas sheets, produces an equally compelling visual ambiguity. Because of the technical flawlessness with which this work was constructed and because of its serial regularity, the light seems to corrode the Plexiglas sheets, creating the convincing illusion that nothing encloses either the top or the bottom of the boxes. Again, as in the wedge-shaped piece from 1963 (see frontispiece), only when the beholder actively looks at the piece, that is, when the viewer bends over and then looks up to see inside the work, can the specific construction of the stacks be ascertained and can the viewer actually see that each of the brass units has Plexiglas on both the top and bottom. (In some previous iterations of stacks from the early 1960s, Judd put Plexiglas only on the bottom of each unit).<fig id="fg11" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Robert Pincus-Witten, reviewing an exhibition of Judd’s work at the Castelli Gallery in 1970, described the ambiguities produced by a single-unit piece made of brass (fig. 11). Noting the material’s “apparent absence of solidity—the sense of liquidity—it induces,” the critic enumerated the perceptual paradoxes of the work, how “There are views, for example, of the polished brass box, in which the recessed top is simply denied, appears flush with the sides. There are other views in which the sides appear translucent rather than reflective, as if one saw the floor <italic>through</italic> the side rather than reflected <italic>off</italic> it.” According to Pincus-Witten, such effects, which he sees in formalistic terms as Judd’s attempt to reconcile “pictorial and sculptural experience,” demonstrate the artist’s “particularly coercive” engagement with the spectator, “forcing him into altered relationships with an elemental, at moments, brutalist, formal vocabulary.” Invoking the martial metaphors frequently found in writings about minimal art, Pincus-Witten contends that Judd’s artworks can be considered “intransigeant barricades” against the blurring of art and life epitomized by artists like Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage, and that the perceptual ambiguities produced by Judd’s art reveal the artist’s “deep need to protect and reinvent the integrity of the Cubist and Constructivist vernacular at the moment when the great tradition of the Cubist monolith is most particularly assailed by the decorative appeals of technological intermedia.”<sup>29</sup> Like much of the fervently formalist criticism that was marshaled to understand the art of the 1960s (especially in the pages of <italic>Artforum</italic>), this analysis insinuates the historical pressures informing such art and its critical reception without ever addressing them head-on. Just as Fried could state in 1965 that such seemingly autonomous and arguably academic modernist painting as Kenneth Noland’s or Jules Olitski’s was “more desperately involved with aspects of its visual environment than painting has ever been,” Pincus-Witten’s attempt to situate Judd’s art within the modernist trajectory of flatness and autonomy (as a means to evade being “assailed” by “technological intermedia”) reveals the works’ significant (if negative) relationship with the burgeoning (and, for certain artists and critics alike, threatening) postmodern landscape of technological and commercial mediation.<sup>30</sup> That is to say, if modernist painting and Judd’s minimalist objects were involved with what many commentators took to be a visual environment of technologically based spectacle, deception, and mediation, the invocation of illusion in these works (as in the vibrating tonalities of color field paintings like Noland’s and the perceptual ambiguities of Judd’s art) would figure the very world of illusion they sought to counter and simultaneously defy it through an obdurate attentiveness to the essential qualities of their chosen medium or materials.<fig id="fg12" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>Apocalyptic Technology</title>
         <p>Many of Judd’s best works from the 1960s exhibit this seemingly paradoxical dialectic of credible materiality and an unhinged perceptual and illusory experience. While it seems likely that Judd invoked such illusionism to heighten the viewer’s sensitivity and skepticism, within his aesthetics of credibility, with its ardent anti-illusionism and foundational empiricism, the perceptual ambiguity consistently produced by the ostensibly impartial materials he chose suggests a certain aporia, or gap—one that operated within the same technological anxiety that ultimately underlined the larger discourse of credibility in American culture. Judd himself never proclaimed any particular interest in technology, and even after 1964, when he had his works fabricated outside his studio, the process was less technological or even industrial than artisanal (since it was typically carried out by small, local firms like Bernstein Brothers or trained craftsmen working in a traditional workshop setting). Nonetheless, his art, with its technical precision and frequent use of unconventional materials and its capacity to seem to insert itself within the viewer’s physical space, led many viewers to regard it as concurrently futuristic and threatening. As the new technology that brought about the revolution in consumer culture during the postwar years began to be associated with specifically military and nuclear projects (as evinced in Rosenquist’s <italic>F-111</italic>), a widespread fear emerged in American culture that the very technological precision and progress that kept the country safe and made people’s lives easier would be the same force that might ultimately destroy civilization. Such sentiments were perhaps most clearly and famously expressed by philosopher Herbert Marcuse in his 1955 study <italic>Eros and Civilization</italic>, in which he described one of the central features of “late industrial civilization” as “the fact that the destruction of life (human and animal) has progressed with the progress of civilization, that cruelty and hatred and the scientific extermination of men have increased in relation to the real possibility of the elimination of oppression.”<sup>31</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The credibility gap in Judd’s art speaks to this crucial anxiety regarding the role of technology in American culture in the 1960s. Producing irrational reflections and perceptual ambiguities when encountered by a mobile human subject, Judd’s art exposes the Achilles heel of technological objectivity: no matter how impersonal and objective a technology is, the human intervention necessary to enable it instigates a problematic doubling that cancels any possible detachment, making the object an inevitable “extension of man” (to borrow Marshall McLuhan’s description of technology).<sup>32</sup> During the 1960s, when technology seemed an increasingly inescapable presence in everyday life, mediating experience and even holding the fate of humankind in the balance, the question concerning man’s relation to technology became especially critical. Reviewing an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1969 that explored modern art’s relationship to technology, critic Max Kozloff diagnosed the growing “fear that our one-time extensions, the machines, are becoming our present competitors; that control and responsibility are becoming too vulnerably compressed; and that increased services by our goods and systems tend more to regulate than to liberate us.”<sup>33</sup> This fateful relation between man and machinery was played out with respective horror and humor in movies like <italic>Fail Safe</italic> and <italic>Dr. Strangelove</italic> (both 1964), in which the combination of human error and technical intransigence (evident in the fail-safe technology that supposedly removed the possibility of human error) lead the human race on a one-way course to extinction. The relation between minimal art and this daunting technological sublime plays a central role in Stanley Kubrick’s follow-up to <italic>Dr. Strangelove</italic>, his <italic>2001: A Space Odyssey</italic> from 1968, a film whose meticulous production values and innovative special effects, which invite a particularly corporeal mode of spectatorship, led Annette Michelson to compare it to a minimalist “Primary Structure” by invoking the exhibition of the same name of two years before. Michelson described the movie’s elaborate and costly production as an enterprise analogous to “the proud marshalling of vast resources brought to bear upon the most sophisticated and ambitious ventures of our culture,” such as “a new inter-continental missile system.”<sup>34</sup> The correlation between technological millenarianism and precisely wrought surfaces of minimal art is materialized in the mysterious black monolith that appears in the opening scenes of the film (fig. 12). After apparently bestowing the first human beings with consciousness (and, as described in Arthur C. Clarke’s accompanying novel, staving off the inevitable extinction of mankind from an extensive drought), the technological essence of this Primary Structure is revealed when a bone, recently discovered to be a valuable weapon by the proto-humans who touched the monolith, is thrown into the air, memorably morphing into an astronautical nuclear missile carrier and thus, through this famous edit, advances the film’s narrative from the “Dawn of Man” to the opposite and equally perilous end of humankind’s existence (fig. 13).<sup>35</sup>

         <title>Judd’s Cold War Monuments</title>
         <p>Reconciling the apparent contradiction between Judd’s aesthetics of credibility and the illusionistic effects produced by many of his chosen materials provides a possible means of understanding not only the opposition between the taciturn austerity of minimalism and the increasingly turbulent social environment of the 1960s but, if understood in terms of the works’ capacity to concurrently reflect and assuage the imperative issues surrounding war and technology, it also provides one possible explanation for minimalism’s ascendancy as the prevailing artistic style throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Judd, who saw his art as political in terms of its ability to encourage a clearer perception and heightened skepticism in the viewer and who repeatedly articulated an antiwar position in his public life, produced works of art that were not so much critiques of the military industrial complex as complex meditations on its inherent contradictions and its relation to the larger culture. And while the technical precision of Judd’s art resonated with the discourse of technological millenarianism grounded in the threat of nuclear war, the same technological anxieties found a ready materialization in the realities of Vietnam, a war in which computers and systems analysis were used to assess the most effective military strategies, leading the writers for <italic>Newsweek</italic> to describe it as “the most depersonalized war America has ever fought.”<sup>36</sup> Supervised by statistical masterminds like Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the Vietnam War, particularly in the years of minimalism’s heyday between 1964 and 1968, was considered, as David Halberstam defined it, “a technological war, a war which could be fought antiseptically, war without death,” thus applying the same technocratic ideology of nuclear war to a limited, non-nuclear war.<sup>37</sup> Judd’s art, described by critic John Perreault in 1967 as containing “the implied IBM numerology and the icy, science fiction surfaces of Flash Gordon bank vaults,” provides a crucial link between the fear of technology out of control, induced in part by U.S. nuclear policy, and the similar sense of political alienation and impotence that accompanied the country’s seemingly headlong advance into Vietnam—what Paul Goodman in 1966 called “the psychology of being powerless.” In this regard, the mute surfaces that contained within them a lurking sense of threat spoke to both the anomie and the aggression that defined much of 1960s culture in the United States.<sup>38</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Considering the well-documented tendency to marginalize violence within the public sphere, there is in fact no necessary contradiction between the rise of minimalism and America’s escalating involvement in Vietnam.<sup>39</sup> One could even argue that it was precisely because of the growing violence and uncertainty in U.S. culture that such a hermetic, cool art found a ready audience, suggesting that if minimal art was not antiwar, it was in many ways pro-peace. “Vietnam’s contribution to the pop psyche has been uncommonly small.” Such was the verdict of the writers for the special issue of <italic>Newsweek</italic> dedicated to the war, which hit the newsstands at the same time as the issue of <italic>Artforum</italic> dedicated to sculpture and featuring such landmark essays as Morris’s “Notes on Sculpture 3” and Fried’s “Art and Objecthood.” “Despite the vocal torment of U.S. intellectuals,” wrote the editors of <italic>Newsweek</italic>, “it sometimes seems that America is doing its best to suppress awareness of the distant war.”<sup>40</sup> The fact that such violent connotations were carried in such mute vessels places Judd’s objects within a long tradition of aesthetic representations during times of war that sublimated violence in the name of some kind of ideological unity.<sup>41</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Within the nexus of technology and military violence that permeated American culture in the 1960s, Judd’s work occupied a position of both resistance and reflection. The paradoxical duality in his art—appearing simultaneously cool and confrontational—found a ready audience in a society engaged in a war that people increasingly distrusted and felt powerless to change. While other artists of the period produced works that explicitly evoked martial motifs, such as Claes Oldenburg’s uncanny tank with a lipstick cannon (fig. 14), De Maria’s <italic>Bed of Spikes</italic> (see fig. 4), or, more explicitly, George Segal’s <italic>Execution</italic> (fig. 15), which was illustrated in the <italic>Newsweek</italic> issue on Vietnam in a section about artistic responses to the war, Judd, true to his aesthetics of unmediated perception, insinuated into his art the emotional affects of such weapons rather than their visual appearance. By assertively placing the onus of perceptual experience on the viewer, Judd’s art produced a stark (and at times threatening) correlative to the uneasiness felt by many viewers concerning the escalating war in Vietnam (and perhaps the larger dread of unbridled technology, manifested in most extreme terror in an all-out nuclear war).<fig id="fg15" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Like the cenotaph built in honor of the Union dead located on the Bull Run battlefield in Manassas, Virginia (fig. 16), which elegantly distills the ungainly realities of war, most notably the bodies of slain soldiers that could not be properly buried, into a unified and resolute (and notably nonobjective) form, Judd’s art conceals the anxieties of new technology that found their most pressing articulation in modern warfare under a stolid and silent surface. As in almost all war monuments, the violent content of Judd’s art is subsumed in the name of compositional unity and ideological closure. In his attempt to transcend what he saw as the irrational legacy of Western civilization through a faith in empirical objectivity, Judd nonetheless produced art that equally bears the traces of war. Created at a moment when a growing number of U.S. citizens were beginning to question the integrity of their government’s policies both overseas and at home, Judd’s sculpture sought to counter a corresponding “credibility gap” between the known perceptual world and the assumed world of predigested images and ideas with objects of unwavering literalness, while simultaneously registering the anxiety of the historical conditions in which his work was produced.<sup>42</sup> In his art from the 1960s Judd revitalized the neglected tradition of sculptural monuments, even as he made markers for a country unsure of its ideals and suspicious of heroism.<sup>43</sup>
