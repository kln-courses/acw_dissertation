In the Confucian teaching, nature is what man has received from Heaven, that is, what Heaven has ordered [ming 命)or given as man's destiny. Thus nature and destiny are inseparable. Ming, however, is not predetermined condition for man、but an ultimate natural principle for man to direct moral effort toward full realization of his nature. This ultimate principle is the Way of Heaven. To Confucius, the Way of Heaven is both principle and oraer of nature. As principle, it is the fundamental cause of all existence. It can be understood in three senses, namely, as an anthropomorphic God, as the objective existence of the highest principle, and as the subjective directing principle implicit in the highest reality. As order of nature, the Way of Heaven is the total evolution of nature. Since human nature, human destiny, and the Way of Heaven are all ultimate principles, they are metaphysical.
