<plain_text><page sequence="1">Werner Wolf (Graz) AESTHETIC ILLUSION IN LYRIC POETRY? 1 . The apparently problematic relationship between aesthetic illusion and lyric poetry With the advent of modernist abstract painting and (post-)modernist anti- mimetic experiments in literature one of the great, if not always linear, devel- opments of Western art has apparently come to a stand-still: a development which Ernst Gombrich, in his seminal work on Art and Illusion , analyzed for the long period between the 'Greek Revolution' of the fourth to the sixth centuries B. C. and the late 19th century and which he described as the "pro- gress [...] from rude beginnings to the perfection of illusion"1. What Gom- brich meant by 'illusion' is actually 'aesthetic illusion', i.e. the vivid feeling, triggered by many - though not all - works of art in a recipient, of experiencing artificial objects or (elements of) a fictional world, as if this world (or its elements) were (a) reality. This feeling, which is opposed to a distanced rational or analytical approach to a work of art as an artefact with certain structures, themes and functions, presupposes the cooperation of the recipient, above all his or her "willing suspension of disbelief for the mo- ment"2 of reception. It is created by an analogy or harmonization between, on the one hand, essential conceptions about reality and fundamental sche- mata of its perception in 'real life' and, on the other hand, homologous structures and contents in the work of art. However, 'aesthetic illusion' dif- fers from 'illusion' as a mere 'delusion' by the fact that the reality im- pression of the work of art is never complete. It is always counterbalanced to some extent by a latent element of rational distance: by the culturally acquired knowledge and acknowledgment of the artificiality of the artefact. 1 Ernst H.

Film, photography, painting, sculpture and to a certain degree even architecture can create aesthetic illusion, and the same is true of verbal art. Here aesthetic illusion is traditionally linked with drama (as 'dramatic illusion'), but narrative fiction (especially the kind written in the tradition of nineteenth-century realism) is no less able to make a reader 'enter a fictional world'. Thus it appears that all arts are capable of aesthetic illusion with the ex- ception of one non-verbal art: music, and its verbal 'sister art': lyric poetry. Although the illusionist experience of a fictional world is even more clearly incompatible with music (which typically does not create life-like worlds) than with lyric poetry, for many people poetry, too, is not easily associated with aesthetic illusion. Indeed, the idea of a 'lyric illusion' seems to be so far-fetched for modern critics that the very possibility of such an illusion is either flatly denied (as by Käte Hamburger3) or that this subject - with very few exceptions (e.g. Hellmut Thomke4) - is only touched upon indirectly5, if treated at all. However, this situation is somewhat surprising, since one of the most famous formulae to describe aesthetic illusion, Coleridge's already quoted phrase of the "willing suspension of disbelief', refers precisely to lyric poetry: to his and Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads. Is the relationship between lyric poetry and aesthetic illusion, a phenome- non encompassed by almost all the other verbal and non-verbal arts, then 3 Käte Hamburger, Die Logik der Dichtung , München 1987 ( 1 1 957); The Logic of Lite- rature, transi.

Theoretical and Historical Approaches , Ber- lin/New York 1990, pp. 250-262. Though Thomke does deal with the question of "lyric illusion" as his main subject, his somewhat random reflections are impaired by not being based on a clear concept of aesthetic illusion.

It is the aim of this paper to attempt an answer to these questions. While individual works of drama and fiction can obviously have a problematic relationship with the tradition of illusionism, too (witness the strong tendency towards anti-illusionism in postmodernist specimens of these genres), their tension with illusion is of a historical or in- dividual, but not of a generic kind. With lyric poetry, however, we have to ask whether we do not encounter a generic resistance - and, if so, whether it is of a nature which precludes aesthetic illusion altogether. My thesis is that lyric poetry does indeed show a certain resistance to aesthetic illusion, but that there are at the same time generic features, centred above all on the 'speaker' of a poem and his or her experience, which nevertheless allow the emergence of illusion, if only in a modified or restricted form. Before we can enter into the subject, the concept of aesthetic illusion should be clarified to some further extent. Since the level of research is more advanced in the theory of narrative illusion6 than in the theory of dramatic illusion, I will take narrative illusion as a starting point and model for my discussion of lyric illusion. One should, however, note one difference right from the start: lyric poetry is a genre in which oral performance is more important than in narrative fiction7. Hence the following remarks aim to take both forms of reception, oral recital and silent reading, into account. 2. Aesthetic illusion: general nature, factors, principles and features of illusionist works (of literature) Aesthetic illusion is a highly complex phenomenon, which can only be out- lined here with respect to some qualitative elements, the most important fac- tors contributing to its emergence, and the most characteristic features of il- 6 Cf.

Schlaffer even goes so far as to postulate that for lyric poetry oral recital is the way of reception or repro- duction par excellence; while this seems convincing at first sight, one must, however, point out that oral reception is inadequate for certain types of poems, especially for texts written in the time-hallowed tradition of 'shaped verse' but also for modern ex- perimental poetry.</page><page sequence="4">254 Werner Wolf lusionist works - as far as they are relevant to our subject8. Though the fo- cus will be on (narrative) literature, most of the general theoretical com- ments on aesthetic illusion made in this chapter should also be applicable - with slight modifications - to other arts capable of aesthetic illusion. As far as the quality of aesthetic illusion is concerned, three additions to the rough definition given above are necessary: First, aesthetic illusion may best be conceived of, in the terminology of the recent theory of world-making, as imaginatively becoming "immersed in [the] fiction" of a "possible world" with the effect of seemingly being "recentered" and "relocated within the created world"9. Being in a state of aesthetic illusion thus means to experience the (elements of) a possible world as from a position 4 within', while at the same time retaining a residual awareness that this 'within' is not reality but the effect of an artefact and of imagination. Second, due to the relative predominance of visual perception in (most) human beings, this illusionist 'entering' the 'world' of the artefact seems to rely heavily on v i s u a 1 'imagination' (the very term expresses this 'pictur- ing' quality, which, of course, also includes changing or 'moving' pictures). And finally, it has to be pointed out that aesthetic illusion is not a static effect of a stable intensity but that it varies historically, individually and even during the reception of one and the same work of art. Owing to its essen- tial bipolarity of predominant 'immersion' and residual distance, aesthetic illusion may be represented as gliding on a scale between two poles - main- taining, however, a relative vicinity to 'immersion'. The poles themselves are excluded, since both total distance and total immersion (a state of delu- sion) do not yet or no longer qualify as aesthetic illusion. To prevent a mis- conception one has to add that in most processes of reception aesthetic illu- sion exists during one stage only and is preceded or followed by other ap- proaches to, or effects of, the work of art. Hence illusionist reception is n o t 8 For more details in the framework of an extensive theory of narrative illusion cf. Wolf, Ästhetische Illusion und Illusionsdurchbrechung (see n. 6); the following re- marks are a condensed and in some details revised version of my theory of illusion presented there. Marie-Laure Ryan, Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence and Narrative Theory , Bloomington/Indianapolis 1991, p. 2 If. In the reading of literature this 'being recen- tered in a possible world' is obviously a purely imaginative act, while in the reception of film, drama and the visual arts a spatial dimension is added, due to which the real space in front of the artifice or surrounding it may become part of the fictional world (e.g. the point of view from which a painting structured according to central perspec- tive is best seen).</page><page sequence="5">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 255 coextensive or identical with reception in general - not even in the reception of illusionist works10. As to the factors cooperating in the emergence of aesthetic illusion, they can be described as elements contributing to a "guided projection"11. The projection takes place in the mind of a specific recipient, yet in the state of aesthetic illusion this mind's activity is not free-floating but 'guided' by the illusionist work of art as well as by its performance (most prominently so in the case of drama), and both the recipient and the work as well as its per- formance are influenced in turn by a context which enables the projection to be successful in the first place. Thus the following factors need to be taken into account: a) the recipient (the 'projector' of illusion), b) the work of art (the guiding 'script'), c) its performance (the mise en scène of the 'script') d) certain cultural and historical contexts (the 'room' in which the guided projection occurs). Aesthetic illusion, as already said, is the effect of a certain correspondence or analogy between a work of art and essential concepts of reality as well as schemata of perception which regulate a prime condition of aesthetic illu- sion, namely verisimilitude. Since there is no "innocent eye"12, no 'natural' perception of reality universally valid, the illusionist effect of an artefact is dependent on such contextual factors as the basic habits of perception and the preconceptions about reality of a given culture and period. Hence verisi- militude is to a large extent a historical and cultural variable with the result that the same work or similar techniques of representation can change in their illusionist valeur according to temporal and local parameters. An additional, equally variable contextual factor influencing aesthetic illusion is the set of generic conventions ruling the production and reception of art in a given period. 10 Cf. for reception as multi-layered activity Roman Ingarden, Das literarische Kunst- werk.

A recipient's response to a work of art in terms of aesthetic illusion is not only subject to external, contextual circumstances but is also heavily dependent on individual factors such as his or her range of experience, age, gender, in- terests, cultural background, ability to 'read' works of art aesthetically and willingness to become immersed in an illusionist reception etc. Owing to these variables, 'context' and 'recipient', to which the factor 'performance' has to be added, it is difficult to decide on the illusionist effect of a given work or artistic technique for all periods and for all indi- viduals. However, this difficulty can be somewhat reduced, if one limits the contextual scope to the past few centuries and Western culture (where the evolution of aesthetic verisimilitude and responses to illusionist art are fairly well documented), and if we - though somewhat artificially - reduce the variability of individual recipients by means of the construct of a historical 'average recipient' who is prepared and able to 'willingly suspend his or her disbelief when 'reading' illusionist art. If context, recipient and performance are problematic variables, this is not true to the same degree of the work of art. Consequently, for the purpose of a theory of aesthetic illusion, the work itself becomes the most important factor. As is well known, the very notion of the 'work' as a ready-made con- struct has come under (mainly deconstructionist) attack. However, the fact remains that where illusion occurs, it is to a large extent the work which guides the illusionist projection, and it is obvious that the data of a given work can be analyzed more easily than the predispositions of individual re- aders, a period's dominant set of concepts and schemata or individual condi- tions of performance. The importance and accessibility of the 'textual' basis permits at least some general comments on the overall aims of illusionism, as deducible from a survey of illusionist works of art, as well as on the for- mal principles that inform these works, their structure and make-up and lead to some characteristics or frequently used techniques. It should be noted that these comments, which constitute the backbone of a 'text-centred' theory of literary illusion, can be derived from a large corpus of primary works which encompass several centuries of Western art, works that have been, and to some extent still are, 'read' as more or less illusionist - in contrast to others (such as radically experimental works of postmodernism) which cannot be read in the same way. It is with this illusionist corpus and its features in mind that something can indeed be said about the illusionist or non- illusionist potential (for no more can be claimed, owing to the variables of context, performance and recipient) of a given literary text or genre. In- deed, this potential depends, to a large extent, on the degree in which a work or group of works shares certain typical illusionist text features: the more</page><page sequence="7">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 257 prominent and frequent these characteristics are, the higher the illusionist potential can be estimated to be. As far as the general aims of illusionist works are concerned, they can be derived from the very nature of aesthetic illusion. Becoming immersed into a fictional world which the recipient can perceive or experience as if it were a reality, that is, in analogy to everyday experience, means that an illusionist work - at least a work that unfolds in a temporal dimension - must possess the quality of 'experientiality'13 and as a consequence that it contains or stages (the gaze of) at least one anthropomorphic being (a 'character' or viewer) to whom things may happen, who is able to do and experience so- mething so that the recipient can 're-experience' it. 'Experience' can hereby refer to phenomena of an external or an internal, psychic nature. But in all cases these phenomena are consciously or intentionally perceived by a human being as remarkable or 'tellable' due to their being apprehended as a unity and as different from other phases of existence14. They affect or interest the experiencing person, because they have a positive or negative relationship to some expectation or because they themselves raise expectati- ons that can be fulfilled or thwarted. Experience thus has a temporal as well as a teleological dimension. As a general condition of an illusionist work and a recipient's 're-experiencing' of its world, 'experientiality' can be achieved if the work follows two more specific aims: a) the imitation of everyday perception and experience, especially with re- spect to the underlying structures, but also to some extent with respect to general contents of our everyday life, and b) the reduction of aesthetic distance to a minimum. As to the principles which contribute cumulatively to reaching these aims, the following set of four principles shaping the substance of an illusionist work plus two principles shaping its 'rhetorical' presentation may be dis- tinguished: 13 This term has been used in narratology to redefine 'narrativity' (cf. Monika Fludernik, Towards a 'Natural' Narratology , London/New York 1996, esp. chap. 1.2.1.), though in a problematic way, since it is apt to blur all generic distinctions in literature. Ex- perientiality', especially if defined as "emotional involvement, evaluative or empa- thetic" (p. 318), can in principle occur in fiction, in drama and - as will be argued here - in lyric poetry, too. That is why I would propose to use 'experientiality' not as a defining category of 'narrativity' but rather as a fundamental textual quality which permits an illusionist reception. 1 Cf. Hans-Georg Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode. Grundzüge einer philosophischen Hermeneutik , Tübingen 1960, p. 62.</page><page sequence="8">258 Werner Wolf a) The principle of detailed world-making : A natural precondition of aes- thetic illusion is to provide the recipient with some concrete 'world ele- ments' as a material of imagination (a mere argument centred on abstract notions would not suffice) - in Chatman's narcological terminology: with 'story-existents' and 'story-events'15, that is, minimally with at least one anthropomorphic character who experiences something. Yet this is not enough. In analogy to the wealth of details usually perceived in everyday li- fe these constituents of a fictional world are usually presented in illusionist artefacts with a tendency towards reducing the indeterminacies (or 'Unbe- stimmtheitsstellen'16) that inevitably occur in fictional representation. This is done by giving 'graphic' details of objects, settings, characters, experiences or events. In fact, illusionist narratives typically do not merely outline worlds but follow what may be termed a principle of detailed world-making. Due to this principle they seem to be centred on the level of 'story' rather than on the level of 'discourse' and are characterized by a predominance of fictional (hetero-)referentiality over self-referentiality. This referentiality can point to a possible world of outer 'reality' (this is typical of the more 'objective' aesthetic illusion of traditional fiction, but also of drama) or of inner, psychological 'reality' (as in the more 'subjective' illusion created by modernist interior monologue or stream-of-consciousness fiction, but also, as will be shown, by a lot of lyric poetry). As a rule, the elements providing the bulk of experiential material for narrative aesthetic illusion are located on the primary or, in Genette's terminology, 'diegetic' level (the result is then what may be called 'primary illusion'); however, in some cases as in Tristram Shandy , where an overt narrator and/or fictional reader are especially prominent on the 'extradiegetic' level, a 'secondary illusion' may (also) be created by the 'extradiegetic' level17. b) The principle of consistency of the possible world: For aesthetic illusion it is not enough merely to (re-)present more or less detailed elements of a fictional world; in order that this world become a 'possible' one in our im- agination, it is necessary (and it harmonizes with the general aim of imitating formal aspects of perception and experience) that the textual data allow an integration into a coherent whole. In most cases this means that in basic re- spects the possible world is (at least) as consistent as the 'real' world ap- 15 'Existents', for Chatman, are setting and characters, 'events', actions and happenings (cf. Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse. Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film , Ithaca/London 1978, chaps. 2 and 3). 16 Cf.

Follow- ing McHale19 one has, however, to acknowledge that the sense-making process involved in illusionist reception tolerates a certain obscurity of co- herence (roughly corresponding to what Iser20 has called 'Leerstellen') in restricted fields - as long as they can be clarified by "'feedback loops'"21 that link the 'deficient' areas with neighbouring more coherent ones (e.g. a seemingly inconsistent behaviour of a character may be explicable with re- ference to a certain situation22). Historically, however, most illusionist works reduce problems with consistency and are characterized, in terms of narratology, by the 'transparency' of their discourse, since it is this transpar- ency which permits the recipient's attention to focus, in a relatively 'easy reception', on the story rather than on the discourse. Of course, 'transparen- cy' does not mean 'absence' of discourse (an impossibility anyway). The level of discourse in illusionist works can even be quite elaborate, as long as it does not foreground this elaborateness, as will be seen in the following, c) The principle of perspectivity: Motivated by the fundamental perspecti vi- ty of everday experience one of the most characteristic hallmarks of the 18 It has been claimed (Günther Klotz, rev. Wolf 1993, Referatedienst zur Literaturwis- senschaft 25/1993 , pp. 493-498, cf. p. 498) that postmodern experience of reality has itself become so incoherent that e.g. the inconsistency and fragmentation typical of much postmodernist fiction can no longer be regarded as being able to break the illusion of reality but rather creates a new effet de réel. I am, however, doubtful whether the average contemporary reader has really changed his or her schemata of perception of everyday life to such a degree as to e.g. accept the blurring of fiction and reality, the impossibility of causality or the invalidity of identity as the normal state of affairs. 19 Brian McHale, "Making (non)sense of postmodernist poetry", in: Michael Toolan (ed.), Language, Text and Context.

In fiction this development is to be seen in the emergence of internal focaliza- don in 18th-century first person letter novels and later in modernist third- person 'figurai narration', where the 'subjectivity' of the internal focalizer is coupled with the 'objectivity' or all but absence of an extremely 'covert' narrator, resulting in an effect of immediacy which is highly conducive to aesthetic illusion. d) The principle of respecting and exploiting the potential of the medium : Since literature, contrary to the visual arts, unfolds in the dimension of time and not of space, illusionist texts usually respect this 'natural' datum of the medium by taking the time-aspect of reception into account, especially in the gradual building up and confirmation of illusion over a more or less ex- tended period of time. This means that a certain text length is helpful for the effect of aesthetic illusion. In illusionist drama and fiction the exploitation of the dynamic quality of the literary medium also leads to a special atten- tion paid to the more dynamic 'story' elements of action and character. A contrary procedure, namely creating works that 'go against the grain of the medium' would expose its limits, make the recipient aware of the artificiali- ty of the work and therefore miss an essential aim of illusionist works: the reduction of aesthetic distance. e) The principle of generating interest in the story : This is a 'positive' rhetorical principle which actively contributes to the general aim of reducing distance in so far as it involves various devices of persuasio directed at ren- dering the story affectively and/or intellectually attractive and at keeping the reader 'in' it. While the means of how to interest the reader are highly va- riable (and may range from story-elements of 'sex and crime' to discursive devices of maintaining suspense and to thematically 'interesting' or contro- versial philosophical issues), the fact that illusionist works tend to help the reader to become 'immersed' in the fictional world can be observed quite frequently. 0 The principle of 'celare artem ': This is the negative counterpart to the foregoing positive rhetorical principle and is equally responsible for mini- mizing aesthetic distance. Works following this principle tend to conceal their artificiality by a relative abstinence from over-intrusive self-referenti- ality and generally from all elements that foreground textuality or fictionali- ty.</page><page sequence="11">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 261 3. Characteristics of lyric poetry and its resistance to aesthetic illusion To what extent is the genre of lyric poetry compatible or incompatible with the general aims of illusionist works and the principles informing their structure and content as delineated in the foregoing chapter? Dealing with generic features of poetry is not easy, since 'lyric poetry' is notoriously the most ill-defined genre of literature among the traditional triad of lyric, dra- ma and fiction. It is clear that in the context of this paper a consistent and all-inclusive definition of lyric poetry cannot be given, an enterprise which for some scholars is an impossibility anyway. However, for my purpose it suffices that a) the concept is a received notion and, despite its problems of definition, usually fulfils its task of designating texts ranging from the medieval Sing cuccu to Wordsworth's The Cuckoo or Seamus Heaney's Digging, and that b) critics have proposed a whole list of characteristic features, which are useful for clarifying the concept23: a) poetry's relative brevity or tendency towards reduction24 and hence a certain compression of meaning; b) the supposed existence of a consciousness or 'persona' responsible for the lyric utterance; in German theory the subject of this ut- terance, since it frequently manifests itself in the first person, is often called 'lyrisches Ich'25; however, it has justly been pointed out that this 23 For recent surveys of the current debate on the definition of the genre cf.

(UTB. 1847 and 1848), Tübingen/Basel 1995, vol. I, p. 9, the 'lyric I' is 'a decisive constituent of the genre', while Wolfgang G. Müller, Das lyrische Ich.

Jaegle's elaborate theory of the lyric subject is unconvincing and largely useless for an approach in terms of aesthetic illusion, since he does not concentrate on the question as to whether the lyric subject can be con-</page><page sequence="12">262 Werner Wolf subject can occupy any position on a scale between the poles of a personal, explicit or overt 'character' and the impersonality of a mere voice coming from an implicit or covert agent, so that the neutral term 'lyric persona' is perhaps most appropriate26; c) an emphasis on the utterance as the product of a consciousness rather than on the content of the utterance (as in narrative fiction)27; this feature has traditionally been formulated in the narrower and more problematic sense of lyric 'subjectivity' as opposed to the allegedly greater 'objectivity' of non-lyric genres28 and has also been related to an opposition between the 'monological' focalization of lyric objects by one speaker or persona vs. the tendency towards 'dialogical' or 'polyphonic' presentation of the fictional world in the novel29; a still further variant of the same idea is the description ceived of as an imaginative (hypothetical) 'voice' or agency but rather on a cognition- theoretical concept of the subject as the result of recursive self-observation. As a con- sequence, he attributes the status of 'subject' not only to a fictional T to be found in (some) lyric texts but also to the recursive, self-referential lyric text as such. 26 In his differentiation of overt and covert forms Bernhart, "Überlegungen zur Lyrik- theorie aus erzähltheoretischer Sicht" (see n. 23), p. 366, proposes the terms "Aussageinstanz" ('utterance agent') or "Bewußtsein" ('consciousness'); Müller, "Das Problem der Subjektivität der Lyrik" (see n. 25), p. 95, speaks of 'explicit or implicit subiectivity'. 27 Cf.

[...] the lyric state- ment-subject does not render the object of experience, but the experience of the ob- ject, as the content of its statement [...]" ("Wir haben [...] die lyrische Subjekt-Objekt- Korrelation zu beschreiben versucht, als eine Struktur, die sich schon dadurch von der objektgerichteten mitteilenden Aussage unterscheidet, daß das Objekt nicht Ziel, son- dern Anlaß ist [...] das lyrische Aussagesubjekt macht nicht das Objekt des Erlebnis- ses, sondern das Erlebnis des Objekts zu seinem Aussageinhalt [...]" [Die Logik der Dichtung , pp. 236 and 2461). 28 Cf.

He describes poetry as an 'anti-discourse' of which the 'trans- gression' of existing schemata of discourse is as typical as the 'multiplication of si- multaneous contexts' (cf. pp. 514 and 517). Although the idea of lyric poetry</page><page sequence="14">264 Werner Wolf Taken together, these features amount to a cumulative description of a majority of texts forming the core of the genre 'lyric poetry'. They conse- quently deserve attention for the illusionist potential of this genre, even though they may not all be of equal value for a comprehensive definition and hence - with the exception of versification - may not apply to each lyric text. If we approach the field of lyric poetry in this way, a few important dif- ferences concerning the genre's capability of aesthetic illusion can be no- ticed in comparison to narrative fiction, differences which result in a re- markable generic resistance of poetry to aesthetic illusion. This is already true of the perhaps most obvious characteristic of poetry, its relative brevity. Lyric poetry tolerates a degree of shortness without quitting the core area of the 'typical' lyric which is neither to be found in the typical short story (nor even the 'short short story') nor in drama. Thus the mere brevi- ty of such a well-known poem as Ezra Pound's In a Station of the Metro , The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough.38 despite its extreme character, does not posit this text at the limits of the genre in the same way as e.g. Beckett's notorious Breath , presumably the shortest and most reductive play of Western literature, is a borderline case of drama. The consequences of this tendency of lyric poetry towards brevity are far- reaching for the genre's potential for aesthetic illusion39. The most obvious effect is certainly that lyric poetry is restricted in its creation of a possible world40 and thus is characterized by a major generic resistance to the build- ing up of illusion: unlike drama and fiction (and especially the novel) poetry does not typically follow the principle of detailed world-making. As a result, indeterminacies are especially frequent. In fact, instead of 'a world' or at 'borrowing' from other schemata of discourse such as narration, description or argu- mentation is appealing, this is certainly not an exclusive quality of poetry. Bakhtin ("Slovo v romane" [see n. 29]), has even claimed that such a 'polyphonic' plurality of discourses is rather a feature of the novel in contrast to the tendentially monological lyric. And neither can the 'trasgressive' tendency of poetry mean that it necessarily must be void of a 'typical' central field in which its 'lyricalness' can best be observed. Cf. also Burdorf, Einführung in die Gedichtanalyse (see n. 23), p. 21 . 38 The Norton Anthology of Poetry , ed. by Alexander W. Allison et. al., New York/London, 3 1983, p. 963.

Both 'events' and 'existents' may indeed be stripped to mere essentials or be left out altogether as in the following poem by W. S. Merwin: Separation Your absence has gone through me Like thread through a needle. Everything I do is stitched with its color.41 The characters are here reduced to a mere two, one of whom is absent. We are given almost no details about them, no names, no description of their appearance, no age, social status, and not even their sex is indicated (even though perhaps most readers would read this text as a heterosexual love poem, in principle all distributions are possible: T and 'you' as male and female, or vice versa, as both male, or both female). The poem is clearly lacking in referential material which could contribute to an easy building up of aesthetic illusion in the way a short story could and would do. The typical tendency of lyric poetry to reduce referentiality is even more prominent in our text in the fact that it completely lacks any indication of setting: the narrated situation and above all the speaker are situated in a temporal and local void, and in this respect the poem is equally opposed to what we would read or watch in illusionist fiction or drama. And as far as the 'action' or experience described in the text are concerned, it is scarcely less vague and undetailed, although the poem does contain a minimal story. Its 'action' is reduced to a) one event in the past, the mere fact of a separa- tion having taken place between two characters, b) an iterative consequence since that past: the speaker's suffering from the separation and constantly thinking of the absent character in his or her - non-defined - activities and c) the act of utterance of these experiences in an again undefined present. The emphasis is quite clearly - in accordance with one of the most frequent- ly mentioned features of lyric poetry - less on outer events or experiences of the possible world than on the inner experience of the lyric persona. The typical brevity of lyric poetry does not only create a tension with the illusionist principle of detailed world-making but also affects the principle of respecting the potential of the linguistic medium. It goes without saying 41 The Norton Anthology of Poetry (see n. 38), p. 1296.</page><page sequence="16">266 Werner Wolf that a very short text, even though it does not essentially run counter to the linguistic medium as a dynamic and temporal medium, cannot fully exploit the dynamic quality of language and its ability to suggest change. Conse- quently, a text-based illusion, which has repeatedly been considered to be the result of a process42 and which above all requires experientiality in- cluding the unfolding of expectations and their fulfilment or disappointment, can often not be 'built up' in poetry in the same way as it is done in fictional or dramatic texts. If the very fact of lyric brevity brings about a general problem with illusio- nist principles, the problem is sharpened in particular if a certain effect of shortness comes into play43: the tendency of a lot of (especially non-narrative) poetry towards 'freezing' the elements of a possible world into more or less static feelings, features of characters, states of consciousness or, as in 'descriptive poetry', objects. Again this does not absolutely exclude illusi- on. In principle illusion can, of course, be created by the (re-)presentation of a static object (as in the visual arts). Yet, as already emphasized in Lessing's Laokoon , the dynamic quality of language renders the representation of static realities more difficult than dynamic ones. Hence a concentration on static elements does not exploit the potential of the linguistic medium as well as the narrative of several events, changing settings and character-configurations would do in drama or the novel. At the same time, to reduce the fictional world to static elements could appear to create a further tension with aesthetic illusion: by decreasing the potential of experientiality. A last consequence of lyric brevity, namely 'compression of meaning', has to be mentioned: its possible (but not necessary) clash with the principle of consistency. In most short stories, where the compression of meaning is also prominent, it nevertheless does not usually impair the logical linearity and transparency of the way in which the possible world is presented. In lyric poetry, however, brevity in combination with a typical emphasis on the perspective of the lyric persona and its perhaps a-rational thoughts quite of- ten entails a more outspoken tendency towards fragmentation, and the pro- duction of an unusually high degree of 'Leerstellen' in Iser's sense: textual 'gaps of meaning' due to which the continuity of reception and the process of making sense of the text and the depicted world is rendered difficult and which require a heightened (often rational) reader-activity. In poetry, such 'Leerstellen' often occur in at first sight 'obscure' comparisons or meta- 42 Cf. already Herbert Grabes, "Wie aus Sätzen Personen werden. Über die Erforschung literarischer Figuren", Poetica 10/1978, pp. 405-428, esp. p. 417. 43 However, other lyric characteristics such as the emphasis on a reality-processing con- sciousness may also play a role here.</page><page sequence="17">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 267 phors. An example is to be found in the second verse line of Separation and its illustration of the consequence of an "absence": "Like thread through a needle." Here an 'easy reception' furthering an illusionist reading is hardly imaginable; the reader is rather invited - in the interest of consistency - to reflect on the possible or probable connection between this highly unusual and 'artificial' comparison and experience and hence is - if only for a certain time - distanced from the fictional experience itself. As is to be seen here, 'Leerstellen' may cause a tension (at least on first reading a poem) with the illusionist principle of consistency if not with the principle of celare artem. Generally, the violation of this latter principle is one of the most obvious obstacles to the creation of an intense illusion. It is a direct consequence of the typically lyric tendency to display an especially high degree of artificiali- ty and self-referentiality as well as an often innovative, defamiliarizing de- viation from the ordinary use of language or literary tradition. The - in comparison to ordinary, 'transparent' discourse - unusual 'musicality' of metre and rhythm, the often intense compression of meaning, the tendency towards formal self-referentiality and rhetoricity and - in written poetry - the fact that the verses of lyric poetry are typographically different from prose - all this contributes to rendering lyric poetry the most blatantly 'artificial' kind of literature. In fact there is no other genre which so often, by laying bare its fictionality or 'made-upness', disobeys the illusionist principle of celare artem and consequently distances the recipient from the created fictional world. 4. Potentials of aesthetic illusion in lyric poetry In view of the long list of strained relationships between poetry and prin- ciples of illusionist text-making, tensions that are not accidentals of individ- ual texts, but can be traced back to generic features of lyric poetry in general, it seems hardly conceivable that poems can have the effect of aesthetic illusion at all. Yet we ought to account for the fact that, notwith- standing the apparent obstacles to aesthetic illusion, lyric poetry neverthe- less has been considered - in different periods and contexts - to be perfectly capable of it. Thus Batteux, in his treatise Les Beaux-Arts réduits à un même principe , celebrates the illusionist 'magic' of "la poésie" (a term which he uses, like his contemporaries, to designate 'literature' in general, and which consequently comprises not only drama and the epic, but also lyric genres such as the fable and "L'Eglogue"44): 44 Charles Batteux, Les Beaux-Arts réduits à un même principe (1746), in: Ch. B., Principes de la littérature (Slatkine Reprints), Geneva 1967, pp. 10-102 (original pagination), p. 37.</page><page sequence="18">268 Werner Wolf C'est une espece de magie: elle fait illusion aux yeux, à l'imagination, à l'esprit même, &amp; vient à bout de procurer aux hommes, des plaisirs réels, par des inven- tions chimériques. C'est ainsi que la plupart des auteurs ont parlé de la Poesie.45 An interesting document of the illusionist power of lyric poetry is also the following passage from Macaulay' s essay on Milton, in which he expressly links the very term poetry' (which again includes 'lyric poetry') with aes- thetic illusion: By poetry we mean not all writing in verse, nor even all good writing in verse. Our definition excludes many metrical compositions which, on other grounds, deserve the highest praise. By poetry we mean the art of employing words in such a man- ner as to produce an illusion on the imagination , the art of doing by means of words what the painter does by means of colours.46 4.1. Aesthetic illusion in special cases of lyric poetry If Batteux and Macaulay were right, how can we explain the occurrence of aesthetic illusion in poetry in spite of the generic resistance outlined above? One possibility would be to concentrate on certain kinds of lyric poetry to which the clashes with important principles of aesthetic illusion do not apply or only apply to a lesser extent. One might think of the following kinds and arguments: The most obvious case, in which a close parallel may be drawn to narra- tive fiction and its undeniable illusionist potential, are narrative poems such as third-person ballads but also first-person poems in which a narrator re- counts his or her own past experience. In poems which thus exploit the po- tential of the linguistic medium in the unfolding of a dynamic story it cer- tainly is not difficult to see that the lyric text can indeed create a 'primary' aesthetic illusion similar to the kind resulting from the reading of a novel or short story. This also applies to a mixed form such as is to be found in one of the most famous poems in English, Wordsworth's Daffodils. The poem starts with a narration of past experience ("I wandered lonely as a cloud [...]"47) in a way which allows the reader to feel what in fiction would be classified as a 'primary illusion' located on a 'diegetic level'. But in the last stanza ("For oft, when on my couch I lie/[...]"48) events are described which recur after this past, but which nevertheless contain sufficient experientiality 45 P. 19. 46 Thomas Babington Macaulay, "Milton", in: Th. B. M., Essays and Lays of Ancient Rome , London 1889 (*1825), pp. 1-28, quotation p. 4, italics mine. The Norton Anthology of Poetry (see n. 38), p. 556. 48 P. 557.</page><page sequence="19">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 269 to permit a rudimentary illusion analogous to a 'secondary illusion9 located on the extradiegetic level in fiction. In both cases, in the case of a narrative poem recounting past experience and in the mixed case of a combined nar- ration of past and present experience, aesthetic illusion does in principle not create a problem. From another point of view this is also true with respect to extended nar- rative poems of the kind of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner as well as to longer descriptive poems. Due to their unproblematic relationship with the prin- ciple of detailed world-making, these kinds of poetry may equally be consi- dered to facilitate aesthetic illusion. An additional argument in favour of the possibility of aesthetic illusion at least in some lyrics is that not all poems necessarily and conspicuously lay bare their artificiality, and that consequently not all poems openly violate the principle of celare artem and follow a potentially anti-illusionist strategy of difficult reception. This is plausible for instance with respect to Words- worth's poetic practice, which to a large extent is informed by his own pro- grammatic criticism of the artificiality of classicist poetic diction and his emphasis on relatively simple "language really used by men"49. And last but not least, there is no reason why lyric poetry should not obey the principle of consistency as much as fiction nor why it should not follow the principle of interesting the recipient in the fictional world (e.g. in a land- scape described or in the love problems of a character) just as intensely as a novel may interest the reader on the level of story. After all, in quite a few poems the tendency towards emotionality, which is often said to be an addi- tional characteristic of lyric poetry, especially of the romantic tradition, may even constitute a strong incentive for readers to feel relocated in the fictional world of a poetic text. 4.2. Aesthetic illusion and generic conventions of lyric poetry Admittedly, the preceding arguments in support of the possibility of a lyric illusion are of a rather restricted validity, since they only apply to some kinds of poetry. Yet there are also some more general arguments which are applicable, if not to all, at least to a greater number of lyric poems. 49 William Wordsworth, "Preface to Lyrical Ballads" (1800), in: D. J. Enright/Ernst de Chickera (eds.), English Critical Texts. 16th to 20th Century , London 1962, pp. 162- 189, quotation p. 164.</page><page sequence="20">270 Werner Wolf The first is based on the circumstance that aesthetic illusion is not created by a text alone but also - among others - by contextual factors. Among these factors generic conventions are particularly important. These conven- tions may not only be responsible for the development of literary devices stimulating (or undermining) aesthetic illusion but are also a filter keeping back anti-illusionist elements which would otherwise indeed render the for- mation of illusion in the recipient difficult. Thus the potentially anti- illusionist effect of the artificiality of lyric poetry may be compensated to a certain extent by the fact that this very artificiality (the use of metre and rhythm, defamiliarized language and a relatively high degree of self- referentiality) belongs to the expectations raised by the genre itself. Hence, lyric artificiality and the resulting deviation from easy reception, while pos- sibly still a theoretical problem of lyric poetry in terms of the formation of aesthetic illusion, may in practice lose much of their problematical status50. The same may be said of the lyric tendency towards a high degree of in- determinacy in the representation of the fictional world. Since the lack of space for presenting details also belongs to the generic conventions, a reader or listener of poetry may be more prepared to Till in' areas of indeterminacy than in drama or in fiction. In fact such 'open spaces', which manifestly invite the illusionist activity of guided projection, may even be a strong stimulus for an illusionist recentering of the recipient. This may also apply to semantic incoherences or 'Leerstellen', at least to some of them: as long as such 'gaps of meaning' can be deleted inside a coherent reading of the fictional world (to the 'enounced' rather than to the 'enunciation'51), they may even enhance the involvement of the recipient with the possible world presented in the text52. This involvement can also be facilitated by the very brevity of the text, which, on the other hand, contributes to the problems with aesthetic illusion outlined above: a typically short and tendentially 'difficult' text such as a lyric poem is usually read more carefully, more slowly and may be re-read more often than a long novel. Of course, the compensating effect of generic conventions can only oper- ate, if a poem offers at least some concrete material for aesthetic illusion and if it permits a meaningful integration of this material into an imaginable 50 A similar argument could be put forward if one considered 'innovation' a wide-spread - and hence received - feature of lyric poetry. For the differentiation derived from Anthony Easthope, Poetry as Discourse (New Accents), London/New York 1983, pp. 40-47, between the levels of the 'enounced' (the elements of the possible world) and the level of the 'enunciation' (the act and manner of discursivization of this world) cf. Hiihn, Geschichte der englischen Lyrik (see n. 25), vol. I, pp. 13-19. Cf. Iser, Die Appellstruktur der Texte (see n. 20), p. 235.</page><page sequence="21">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 27 1 coherent whole. Since, as we have said, lyric poetry tends towards brevity and towards a highly reduced presentation of a fictional world, this raises the question: does it typically provide the minimal material for literary illu- sion, i.e. at least (the gaze or perceptions of) one anthropomorphic being inside a fictional world and an experience centred on this being so that the recipient can (re-)experience something? 4.3. Aesthetic illusion and the overt lyric persona As far as the first minimal condition is concerned, I think it is fulfilled by the lyric persona as a, or even the, centre of experientiality in poems. My thesis is that it is typical of the majority of poems, though not necessarily constitutive of the genre 'lyric poetry' (and that it is typical far beyond the narrow confines of quasi romantic, quasi-autobiographical 'poetry of personal experience' or 'Erlebnislyrik') to permit to some degree the (re-)construction or guided projection of a fictional lyric consciousness or persona53 as a focus of experience for the recipient. And I contend that it is mainly this characteristic feature which indeed provides a powerful basis for aesthetic illusion, so that an a-priori incompatibility between lyric poetry and aesthetic illusion cannot be maintained. Lyric poetry can be divested of almost everything which in fiction would correspond to 'story-events' and 'story-existents': of a specified setting and outer reality, of plot, and of all the characters - but in most cases one ele- ment still remains: the speaking (or thinking) persona (or personae), his or her consciousness or experience. Contrary to narrative fiction, where it is hardly conceivable (unless in highly experimental texts) that the narrative consists exclusively of the mere thoughts of a character without setting this character in a more or less specified local and/or temporal context54, lyric poetry (as exemplified in Separation ) can be, and often is, reduced to just that: a consciousness occupied with memories, feelings or perceptions and nothing else. 53 Cf. also McHale, "Making (non)sense of postmodernist poetry" (see n. 19), p. 9, who regards the "level of voice" permitting "the reader [to] reconstruct [...] for the poem a 'speaker' or source persona" as one of the most fundamental means of "integration which have served readers well in their naturalizations of (at least) western poetry since (at least) the Renaissance". 54 Even such an extreme case as the last chapter of Ulysses presupposes a specific set- ting (detailed in previous chapters, namely the bedroom of a house in Dublin's Eccles Street on the night between June 16 and 17, 1904), and contains some residual outer 'events' such as the starting of Molly's period and her intention to use the chamber pot.</page><page sequence="22">272 Werner Wolf But how can the lyric persona be connected with illusionist reception, which presupposes some sort of mental 'image' or idea connected with this persona? Let us first consider the simpler and quite frequent case of an 'overt persona', in which the lyric persona is manifest by the use of first per- son pronouns. Linguistically, the T of ordinary oral discourse is a definite deictic ele- ment which needs no further identification, since it refers to the visibly present speaker of the utterance in a specific communicative situation55. In most cases of communication, this 'I' also implies the presence of a 'you' which, like the 'I' (but unlike a 'he' or 'she' referring to an absent person), does not require further specification either. In ordinary written communi- cation, for instance in a letter, the situation is different: the 'I' and/or the 'you' are physically absent, and there is usually no definite communicative situation. Consequently, these elements need textual specification, which may be given e.g. in the indication of a sender and addressee and references to time, place etc. In drama and narrative fiction, 'I' as well as 'you' and third persons are fictional roles without an immediate deictic reference and a specific 'real' communicative situation56. This indeterminacy is, however, reduced in the reception and by the fictional situation created in the text: in a dramatic per- formance most obviously by the presence of the actors, in a drama script by the information contained in the stage directions, and in fiction by various means including paratexts, direct information given on the extradiegetic level and indirect one to be derived (as in drama) from the interaction of the characters on the intradiegetic level. In lyric poetry, however, 'I' and 'you' usually constitute a particularly undefined 'empty deixis'. This is a consequence of the fact that lyric poetry is the only genre in which utterances of an 'I' and references to an addressee are conventionally not expected to be specified, since - and here we are reminded of the special affinity between lyric poetry and oral recital - the utterance of an 'I' is received as the simulacrum of a 'performative' oral (dramatic) discourse57, the equally performative loud rendering of an interi- 55 For a detailed linguistic approach to the lyric T cf. Spinner, Zur Struktur des lyri- schen Ich (see n. 5), pp. 12-19. 6 Cf. Wolfgang Iser, "Die Wirklichkeit der Fiktion. Elemente eines funktionsgeschicht- lichen Textmodells der Literatur", in: Warning (ed.), Rezeptionsästhetik (see n. 20), pp. 277-324, esp. pp. 290 and 294. Instead of a first person singular (the much-discussed 'lyric I'), a first person plural (as in lyrics spoken by a chorus, cf. Lamping, Das lyrische Gedicht [see n. 29], p. 76) or a second person pronoun clearly implying the presence of an T may alternatively appear on the surface of the text.</page><page sequence="23">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 273 or monologue or a memory of past experience affecting a character at the moment of utterance. In fact, the lyric persona is not just one character among others, but has a privileged position: due to the monologicity and the tendency to reduction typical of poetry, it is frequently the only anthropo- morphic being appearing in the text, and, unless clear signals point to the contrary (e.g. speech markers in narrative poems indicating direct speeches or thoughts of other characters or a massive semantic incoherence as in some 'concrete pfoetry'), it is the character to whom conventionally the entire poem is attributed as his or her spoken discourse or thoughts. And it is this character who, in poems written in the present tense, is to be regarded as present in the situations referred to in his or her discourse. The lyric persona is here consequently located on the level of the enounced, i.e. the fictional world of experience and hence a 'character', and not to be confused with the subject of the enunciation (a 'narrator' of past events, the 'implied author' or the 'text'), let alone with the real author58. If the utterance of the lyric persona is 'performative' and refers to a present (inner or outer) experience, a major narratological distinction, which is crucial for narrative fiction and may perhaps be maintained for narrative poems centred on a past experience, becomes meaningless for a large group of lyric texts: the distinction between 'extradiegetic' and 'intradiegetic' levels. This is not only due to terminological reasons (since lyric poetry is not necessarily 'diegetic' or 'narrative', I would propose to replace the nar- ratological pair of terms by the analogous coinage 'extra-' vs. 'intra- experiential'), but also because in most poems the extra-experiential level collapses into the intra-experiential one, so that all becomes a 'performative' discourse reflecting the present outer or inner experience of the lyric perso- 59 na . This has important consequences for the possibility of aesthetic illusion in lyric poetry. Due to the conventional reception of lyric poetry as a present, 'performative' discourse in analogy to an 'ordinary' oral communi- cation, most lyric poetry appeals to the recipient to (re-)construct in imagi- nation elements of the situation normally constituting and framing oral communication. The indeterminacy typical of lyric poetry need hereby not be exclusively regarded as a hindrance to aesthetic illusion. The lack of specification of the speaker and/or the addressee imitates a similar absence 58 For the history of received notions on the relationship between the lyric persona and the real author cf. Spinner, Zur Struktur des lyrischen Ich (see n. 5), pp. 1-6. Given the typical lyric emphasis on a world-processing consciousness, even past events recounted in narrative poems may achieve the quality of a present (re-) experience much more readily than in narrative fiction.</page><page sequence="24">274 Werner Wolf in oral communication or interior monologue and in so far increases the plausibility of the text60. Moreover, as already mentioned, indeterminacies can also be strong incentives to an activation of the recipient. In so far as this activation refers to an imaginative (re-)construction of elements of a fictional world, we already approach the field of aesthetic illusion. This (re-)construction applies above all to the imagination of the presence of a speaker in some sort of local and temporal situation right from the begin- ning61. In imagination this presence may become identical with the present of the recipient - the present tense as the predominant tense in lyric poetry (and in drama as opposed to most fiction) serves as an important stimulus here. Lyric poetry can thus benefit more or less automatically from a pro- illusionist effect which is usually attributed to dramatic discourse and narra- tive streams of consciousness or interior monologues, namely the 'illusion of immediacy'62. If this effect of immediacy and presentness is felt63 the recipient becomes, so to speak, a listener to the speech or the 'loud thinking' of a character 60 Cf. Eva Müller-Zettelmann, Lyrik und Metalyrik, Graz 1998 doctoral thesis, chapter 3. 61 This does not preclude taking into account further direct or indirect specifications of this role in the course of the process of reception; these specifications can, of course, also lead to modifications of initial imaginative constructions. Cf. Franz K. Stanzel, Theorie des Erzählens (UTB. 904), Göttingen 1991 ( 1 1 979), p. 193. Even though this 'illusion of immediacy' is conducive to the 'immersion' into fictional worlds, it is, strictly speaking, not the same thing as aesthetic illusion: in fiction it is a special case of a paradoxical and hence deceptive impression, namely of an immediacy which according to the doctrine of narrative a priori mediacy cannot really be the case (cf. p. 192). Curiously, Hamburger, who rejects the idea of an aesthetic illusion of lyric poetry (cf. above, n. 3), acknowledges this very immediacy and presentness of the lyric persona in a memorable passage: "[...] we always stand in direct confrontation with it, just as we do vis-à-vis the utterance of a real 'Other', of a Thou who speaks to my I. There is no mediation of any kind." (Hamburger, The Logic of Literature [see n. 3], p. 271) ("[...] wir stehen ihm immer unmittelbar gegenüber, so wie wir der Äußerung eines wirklichen 'anderen', eines Du, das zu meinem Ich redet, gegenüberstehen. Eine Vermittlung irgendeiner Art gibt es nicht." [Die Logik der Dichtung , p. 239f.]) Yet, if "we re-experience" (p. 270) ("nachzuerleben" [p. 238]) a poem "just as the account of a specific experience communicated by word of mouth or in a letter" (p. 269) ("so gut wie einen uns mündlich oder in einem Briefe mitgeteilten spezifischen Erlebnis- bericht" [p. 238]), if "we experience the lyric statement as a reality statement" (p. 271, while - one has to add - knowing about its 'as-if-status') ("daß wir die lyrische Aussage als Wirklichkeitsaussage erleben" [p. 239]), this exactly fulfils the minimal conditions of aesthetic illusion. Hamburger's otherwise puzzling account of what happens in the reception of poetry derives from an erroneous identification of the "statement-subject" ("Aussagesubjekt") with the real "poet" (p. 276) ("Dichter" [p. 241]), an identification which has justly been criticized by René Wellek, Discrimina-</page><page sequence="25">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 275 'over-heard', and thereby comes to occupy the place of the second person who is implied in most communicative situations. This is perhaps most easily to be seen in meta-lyric and other poems where an overt 'you' appearing on the surface explicitly refers to a reader role64. In other cases, where an explicit 'you' (as for instance in an ode) refers to a specified fictional 'third party' thereby excluding the reader, he or she may still imaginatively occupy the position of a 'hidden' listener65, and the same is true of poems without a 'you' appearing on the surface. Due to the imagined presence of a lyric 'I' or persona 'over-heard' by the recipient, he or she can thus in all these cases feel "recentered [...] within the created world"66, which then is no longer the exclusive " experience-field '67 (" Erlebnisfeld" ) of the lyric persona(e) but is also shared by the recipient. Whenever such a recentering takes place, aes- thetic illusion occurs. In this recentering the role of the lyric persona can be two-fold: similar to a first-person focalizer in 'figurai' narrative fiction68 - it is first of all a medium or subject through which the fictional world (or an element of it) is experienced, but it can also become a privileged object of experi- ence itself - again similar to a focalizer in fiction or a character in drama. As a medium through which the fictional reality is perceived, the lyric persona provides a centre of internal perspective for the recipient and thus fulfils a crucial element of the pro-illusionist principle of perspectivity. Inter- estingly, this internal perspective, in fiction a historically belated develop- tions. Further Concepts of Criticism , New Haven/London 1970, p. 221. While she acknowledges the possibility of stating a fictional (e.g. dream-like) experience, the reality of the "statement-subject" ("Aussagesubjekt") for her apparently precludes the (re-)construction of a fictional communicative situation in which this subject is present, since this subject, to her mind, is always outside the fiction. 64 Cf. Jonathan Holden, "The Abuse of the Second-Person Pronoun", in: J. H., The Rhetoric of Contemporary Lyric , Bloomington 1980, pp. 38-56, esp. p. 38, who, in his critical discussion of the "ambiguous 'you'" in poetry, speaks of the "greater sense of intimacy" and "of the narrator's speaking presence" as one of its possible effects. 65 For the generally neglected field of the iyric you' cf. Gudrun M. Grabher, Das lyri- sche Du. Du-Vergessenheit und Möglichkeiten der Du-Bestimmung in der amerika- nischen Dichtung (Anglistische Forschungen. 202), Heidelberg 1989; for a possible 'identification' with a 'lyric you' in the privileged case of a meta-lyric poem see for instance Denise Levertov's "Poet and Person" discussed by Grabher, pp. 121-123 (However, Grabher, as she says on p. 191, is not primarily concerned with the recep- tion side of the 'lyric you').

Stanzel, Theorie des Erzählens (see n. 62).</page><page sequence="26">276 Werner Wolf ment of refined narrative technique, seems to be a 'natural' generic possibili- ty in lyric poetry - so that poetry does not only typically offer a resistance to aesthetic illusion, as pointed out above, but also contains a crucial element favouring it: it is in fact due to this centre of an internal perspective that a process of illusionist participation is very much facilitated. In so far as this link with a human focalizer enables psychological 'inside views' of his or her consciousness and outside views of the fictional world only to the extent of its being processed by the same consciousness, the reception of lyric poetry mirrors the emphasis on the mediating consciousness characteristic of lyric poetry and at the same time marks an important difference from the (illusionist) reception of drama or fiction. In fiction (except for figurai narration with a human focalizer) and in drama the recipient may become immersed in the fictional world without being assisted by the point of view of a particular character and without getting insights into a conscious- ness (in fiction this is most clearly so in texts written in the 'camera-eye- technique'); in poetry, at least in present-tense poetry, this is impossible. Schlaffer has claimed69 that this experiencing the lyric world from within is identical to an impersonation and that it means for the reader to 'occupy' the role of the lyric persona, to enter its consciousness and to adopt its dis- course as his or her own. However, to postulate such an 'identification' as the usual condition of illusionist, let alone a 1 1 reception of lyric poetry, is highly problematic. Symptomatically, Schlaffer derives part of his argument from parallels with a non-aesthetic use of poetry (ritualistic formulae, church-songs and prayers), in which indeed the speaker or singer occupies the role of the 'lyric I'. Yet to consider this way of role playing a general response inherent in the strategy of all aesthetic poems runs into serious dif- ficulties in texts such as the following modern example of a 'chorus-song', Gwendolyn Brooks' We Real Cool : WE REAL COOL The Pool Players. Seven at the Golden Shovel. We real cool. We Left school. We Lurk late. We Strike straight. We 69 Cf. "Die Aneignung von Gedichten" (see n. 5).</page><page sequence="27">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 277 Sing sin. We Thin gin. We Jazz June. We Die soon.70 It is hardly conceivable that the strategy of the text aims at a taking over the role of the 'pool players' (or one of them). The pool players may - and should - well affect us and induce us to occupy a place in the fictional space delineated by their discourse, but they are no roles we should adopt but ob- jects of our pity or criticism, characters who perhaps induce us to become aware of the social conditions producing such a precarious human existence. Clearly, impersonation would preclude such a critical distance from the lyric persona, who appears here as the pool-players' spokesman (and this would also apply to an overt 'lyric you', which can, but need not, refer to a reader- role). This distance, it has to be added, is no hindrance to aesthetic illusion: it is not the rational distance from which we - in another stage of the recep- tion - consider the text from the 'outside', as an artefact, but the distance of an observer still imaginatively situated inside the fictional world71. In fact Brooks' poem demands more or less that we take the pool players seriously as objects of illusion and that we imagine, to a certain extent, their eccentric lives on the margins of society: not by adopting their role but by witnessing both these characters and their situation as they are revealed by their dis- course. In short, what the text requires is a position nearby, but not identical with, the lyric persona. However, this is only a particular case of a general fact: namely that the illusionist reception of a fictional world-making em- ploying internal focalization does not necessarily entail an 'identification' with a focalizer in the kind of role-play Schlaffer postu- lates72. This is, of course, not to say that an imaginative occupying the role of the lyric persona is not possible in some cases of lyric reception - and the 70 The Norton Anthology of Poetry (see n. 38), p. 1 183. Thus the tension between the lyric 'role' and the (normal) position of the recipient, which Schlaffer concedes, too (cf. "Die Aneignung von Gedichten" [see n. 5], p. 44), is not a difference which has to be generally disregarded in lyric reception, as Schlaf- fer suggests, but can become a built-in device of a text-strategy which has to be taken seriously. 72 This also applies to an aspect of aesthetic illusion in narrative fiction which has not yet been explored in depth by previous research and for which the standard descrip- tion of 'illusion of immediacy' is certainly not sufficient. For a first approach to the general problem of relating 'identification' to aesthetic illusion cf. Wolf, Ästhetische Illusion und Illusionsdurchbrechung (see n. 6), chap. 1 .4.6.</page><page sequence="28">278 Werner Wolf same is true of drama or fiction. It may even happen quite often in the cour- se of a reading that the lyric persona at first serves as a focus of attention to draw the recipient 'into' the fictional world, and then offers more and more opportunities of taking over its role - which a reader may accept, provided neither the strategy of the text nor personal reasons oppose an impersonation (again this may also apply to the 'lyric you'). In some cases the taking over of a literary role even exceeds the process of reception: when passages of a text are adopted as quotations and used in everyday life as 'nuggets of truth'. With respect to the element of 'character', the aesthetic illusion created by lyric poetry thus does not seem much different from the kinds of illusion typical of drama or figurai narration. Yet even in this field, lyric illusion does possess some important special features. One of them can be derived from Stierle73. Similar to Schlaffer, he, too, seems to generalize the adoption of the lyric persona' s role as typical of lyric reception. He does so in an apparently contradictory description of the relationship between the recipient of a poem and the text: he claims that it is a 'relation of participation' ("Relation der Partizipation") and a role playing ("Der Rezipient übernimmt die Rolle des sujet de l'énonciation"), but not an 'empathy' ("'Einfühlung'") nor an 'identification' with a series of outer moments of experience, as is the case in most narrative fiction74. However, with this distinction Stierle nevertheless points out a crucial difference, both of the lyric persona as an object of observation and as a locus of a role playing (if it takes place) in contrast to much fiction and drama. It is a dif- ference connected with the indeterminacy characteristic of lyric poetry and already touched upon in the above description of the lyric 'I' as an 'empty deixis': while drama and fiction, due to the usually greater number of details concerning outer experience, frequently offer both relatively well-defined objects and roles with which a reader may indeed 'identify' in a certain sense, the data offered by lyric poetry - including the crucial lyric persona - are usually sparse, which would indeed render 'empathy' difficult, and the identity of the persona itself is often, as Stierle emphasizes, a 'problematic' one75, e.g. a character in search of his or her own identity. So, what the re- cipient ultimately either observes or 'takes over' here is not (the role of) a fully developed character acting in a series of events but some sort of expe- 73 "Die Identität des Gedichts" (see n. 5). 74 P. 522. 75 P. 521.</page><page sequence="29">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 279 rience lived by a relatively vague subject or consciousness76 - if not the very fact of the perspectivity of experience itself. Though literary experience never means the mere adopting of a completely fixed role, one can thus say that the degree of openness typical of lyric personae is usually much higher than in characters of fiction or drama. This is not necessarily a disadvantage in terms of illusion, since the relatively imprecise definition of the lyric per- sona both as object of observation and as a role offers broader possibilities for individual recipients to respond to it77: as a potential confirmation but also a destabilization of the recipient's own identity. As a consequence, the illusionist reception of poetry which is centred on the lyric persona can thus be conceived of as an imaginative experience of a problematic identity either 'from close by' or 'from within', an experience which offers to an especially high degree what basically all fictional literature does: it allows us not only to explore our own identity78 but also to gain a better under- standing of the 'Other'79. 4.4. Aesthetic illusion and the covert lyric persona So far the argument in favour of a possible lyric illusion was based on po- etry with an 'overt' lyric persona. The case seems to be more difficult with respect to poems in which the general lyric indeterminacy goes so far as to let no 'lyric I' appear on the surface, as for instance in Pound's In a Station of the Metro . Yet, as has been argued80, even in these cases - as well as in descriptive 'object-poems' or 'Dinggedichten'81 - traces of a 'covert' persona may be found. In Pound's poem, which Müller has used as an especially conspicuous example82, it is the deictic "these" which refers back 76 Cf. Stierle, "Die Identität des Gedichts" (see n. 5), p. 522: "Die Erfahrung, die Lyrik ermöglicht, ist nicht die Erfahrung der Identifikation mit einer Folge von in der Nar- ration organisierten 'auswendigen' Erfahrungsmomenten, sondern die eines 'inwendigen', subiektbestimmten Erfahrungszusammenhangs." 77 Schlaffer, too, insists on the lyric 'I' as an 'empty sign' (cf. "Die Aneignung von Ge- dichten" [see n. 5], p. 40), which due to its very emptiness may easily be filled by the recipient, but he does not contrast this (possibility of) lyric impersonation with the kind offered by (a lot of) fiction or drama. 78 Cf. also Jaegle, Das Subjekt im und als Gedicht (see n. 5), p. 90f. 79 Cf. also Schlaffer, "Die Aneignung von Gedichten" (see n. 5). d. 5 lf. 80 Cf.

Müller, "Das Problem der Subjektivität der Lyrik" (see n. 25).</page><page sequence="30">280 Werner Wolf to such a covert persona present in the situation described. Nevertheless, a high degree of covertness could indeed be seen as a problem for the idea of an illusionist recentering of the recipient. Yet I think that the generic convention which has been mentioned above and which invites the recipient to complete essential elements left indeter- minate by the lyric text also operates in poems with covert lyric personae and, in principle, permits an illusionist reception similar to the one described above. In staged drama (as in film) direct speech or loud thinking are usually clearly and visibly linked with the characters on stage (or screen), even if no first person pronouns are used for some time (in the script this link has to be indicated by stage directions); in narrative fiction the fact that an interior monologue or an utterance in direct speech occurs is usually also indicated, contextualized by a 'setting' or at least rendered plausible, and it has to be linked with an overt intradiegetic character or 'focalizer'. In con- trast to that, poetry is a genre, or rather t h e genre, in which even the most basic speech markers including the deictic 'I' can be absent, and yet - bar- ring clear contrary evidence - it is taken for granted that the lyric text con- sists of the direct speech or thoughts of the lyric persona as a being present in a fictional situation, no matter how covert this being and this situation are and how indirectly we gain access to them. Of course, given the fact that aesthetic illusion is a variable phenomenon, this is not to suggest that, as far as the 'illusion of character' is concerned, overt lyric personae would not typically create an intenser illusion than co- vert ones. It is certainly helpful, if a poem is not too deficient in data which might contribute to directly particularize the role of the lyric persona and its experience. Yet one can safely say that in poetry, as long as the lyric persona is in all probability a centre of (present) experience, the covertness of this persona is not an a priori obstacle to an illusionist recentering of the recipient in a fictional world. 4.5. Aesthetic illusion, lyric world-making and experientiality But in how far can a lyric persona - and poetry in general - be said to fulfil the second important precondition of aesthetic illusion: experientiality? Again narrative poems with a strong referential and dynamic bias do not present a problem, and neither does the kind of subjective biographical 'Erlebnislyrik' typical of romanticism, but what if the enounced of a poem is reduced to a mere description of a static object mirrored in a consciousness, or if there seems to be nothing else in the fictional world than just a lyric persona thinking?</page><page sequence="31">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 28 1 It would indeed seem odd if nothing more than merely the existence of the lyric persona as an empty counter in an otherwise empty 'world' would suffice for aesthetic illusion to emerge83. Yet in fictional discourse it is actually impossible to speak of 'the mere existence' of a lyric persona, for how can such a persona be perceived to exist unless by data processed by its consciousness? In fact, it is these very data which not only help to define the lyric persona, if only indirectly, but also usually furnish additional material for aesthetic illusion by locating the lyric persona in a world. If we disregard for a moment the possibility that the persona is exclusively occupied with the self-referential act of commenting on the very text we are reading or with an abstract argument, these data will most probably indicate some 'frame of reference' which establishes links with our knowledge of an imaginable reality and will thus provide referential material of some kind. As is well-known in frame theory, frames of reference (that is, items of pre- established knowledge that regulate the understanding of discourses and situations) can be activated by a minimum of indicators. Similarly, a mini- mum of material can suffice in a poem to evoke a situation that may lead to the formation of aesthetic illusion in the recipient's mind84. Of course, due to the lyric emphasis on the persona-consciousness, the access we gain to this situation will in most cases be rather indirect, as is the case in Brooks' We real cool. In fact, a curious oscillation frequently characterizes the reception of a lyric possible world: an oscillation between looking at this world with the 'focalizer(s)' and looking at the focalizer(s) looking. The lyric persona thereby becomes comparable to a headlight that reveals itself by being switched on, but whose beam also reveals aspects of the world85. In both respects the poem follows the illusionist principle of (detailed) world- 83 Cf. McHale, "Making (non)sense of postmodernist poetry" (see n. 19), p. 9, who mentions not only "[t]he level of voice" but also "[t]he level of world" as important lyric elements that furnish basic material for what is in turn basic for aesthetic illu- sion: the sense-making process. Cf. Müller-Zettelmann, Lyrik und Metaly rik (see n. 60), chapter 3. For the general relationship between frame theory and literature cf. Werner Wolf, "Framing fiction. Reflections on a narcological concept and an example: Bradbury, Mensonge ", in: Andreas Solbach/Walter Grünzweig (eds.), Narratologie, Rhetorik, Textlinguistik. Ein Integrationsversuch (Mannheimer Beiträge zur Literaturwissenschaft), Tübingen, forthcoming. As a rule, inside the main text no other illuminating 'beams' exist, although this does not prevent the fact that elements outside the main text, i.e. 'paratexts', and above all the t i 1 1 e of a poem, could in principle constitute another 'perspective' or another voice (for the "far more essential function" ["weit wesentlichere Funktion"] of titles in poetry than in "the fictional genre" ["der fiktionalen Gattung"] cf. Ham- burger, The Logic of Literature [see n. 3], p. 268; Die Logik der Dichtung , p. 237).</page><page sequence="32">282 Werner Wolf making, to some extent, but what is more, by throwing light on world- elements the lyric persona broadens the basis for aesthetic illusion. As the centre of perspective in a possible world it helps the reader to re-create some concrete elements of this very world apart from the persona- consciousness and thus enlarges the poem's potential for illusionist experi- entiality. These elements may be of various kinds: either present in the persona' s situation86 or past or only imagined, either dynamic or static. Even if the content of the persona-consciousness is a static object, contrary to what one might think at first, this need not preclude experientiality (unless the description of the object is reduced to a mere catalogue of attributions). Al- though a dynamic quality of the fictional world is undoubtedly an advantage for aesthetic illusion to emerge, even a descriptive poem concentrating on such static things as Wordsworth's yew trees or Keats's Grecian Urn can fulfil the condition of dynamic sequentiality of experience: both in the con- sciousness of the lyric persona perceiving the object and in our 're- experiencing' this dynamic perception in the reading process. As we read on, different aspects of the object described are revealed and expectations previously formed are fulfilled or modified. That an intentional focus of a dynamic perception with ensuing questions and (imagined) answers is by no means incompatible with the description of static objects is illustrated for example in the numerous questions pervading the Ode on a Grecian Urn , questions which, however, do not get a concrete answer: What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape Of deities or mortals, or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady? What men or gods are these? What maidens loth? What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?87 The perception of the urn - in this poem functioning as a meta-aesthetic mise-en-abyme of the reception of art in general - is manifestly not a predominantly passive and static phenomenon but an active process. After these initial questions the speaker takes a closer look at the urn, which fires his imagination to the point of having the urn say in the famous last lines: 86 With respect to this quite frequent possibility, Schiafferà apodictic remark, "[a]nwesend in der Lyrik ist [...] nicht die 'besprochene Welt', sondern nur der Akt des Besprechens selbst", certainly does not do justice to what happens in an illusionist reception of a great number of poems ("Die Aneignung von Gedichten" [see n. 5], p. 55). The Norton Anthology of Poetry (see n. 38), p. 663.</page><page sequence="33">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 283 "Beauty is truth, truth beauty," - that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.88 Clearly, description, even though it is centred on a static 'urn', here becomes a dynamic imaginative activity. And to follow such thoughts closely fulfils the condition of experientiality quite well - even if one does not 'take over' the role of Keats's lyric persona. To maintain the idea of experientiality in this case means, of course, to abandon the link with outer events and to acknowledge that 'events' and experience can also happen in the realm of the psyche and that witnessing this can in itself constitute an experience. Yet since the emergence of the modernist mimesis of the 'adventures' taking place in human consciousness this should hardly posit a problem. 4.6. Lyric illusion vs. narrative and dramatic illusion As we have seen, lyric poetry is indeed able to overcome, to a large extent, the generic resistance towards aesthetic illusion and to fulfil its minimal conditions, so that the recipient can become recentred in a fictional space which contains both (the perceptions of) at least one overt or covert anthro- pomorphic being and an experience made by this being. This capability is not only to be observed where lyric poetry 'borrows' from drama or fiction (whose capacity for aesthetic illusion has never been contested) or where (as in descriptive poems) it borrows - according to Horace's formula "ut pietura poesis" - from painting, but even where, according to a widely received opinion, it is perhaps most genuinely 'lyric': in the short lyric where a single persona utters his or her thoughts, emotions, perceptions or recollections as elements of a personal experience. However, even though poetry can thus be seen to have a fairly general potential for aesthetic illusion and is in so far basically comparable to drama and fiction, the foregoing discussion has also shown that lyric illusion, where it does occur, is often different from dramatic and narrative illusion as to the details. This shall be summarized in the following, together with some further reflections. Perhaps the most obvious difference which we have encountered apart from the emphasis on psychic introspection is due to the high degree of in- determinacy of both lyric objects and characters. As a result, the textual guiding of the illusionist projection is in poetry usually less specific and leaves the recipient more freedom. Lyric illusion, unlike the typically narrative illusion of being confronted with a plurality of characters in a well-defined 88 P. 664.</page><page sequence="34">284 Werner Wolf possible world, in some cases may be no more than an imaginative partici- pation in what happens in a consciousness. This is a consequence of the fact that the focus in a lyric possible world is much more on a consciousness or a 'focalizer-character' than on objects and events (a field in which fiction and drama are privileged). Nevertheless, the resulting typically lyric 'illusion of character' is among the most powerful kinds of aesthetic illusion89. In poe- try, the power of this kind of illusion, but also of lyric illusion in general, mostly derives from the impression of immediacy with respect to both psy- chic introspection and the vision of a fictional world. This effect of an inter- nal perspective, it is true, may also be achieved in fiction, but is perhaps more characteristic of lyric poetry. Two further general differences from either narrative or dramatic illusion have to be mentioned. The first can be noticed especially in poems where the fictional world is reduced to the presence of a lyric persona and a few thoughts, impressions or reminiscences processed by its consciousness. Lyr- ic illusion here often lacks the predominantly pictorial quality it usually has in narrative fiction and drama. There are, however, pro-illusionist compen- sations for this lack of visualism. One occurs wherever poetry, in place of the rendering of an outer, visual reality, provides a plausible mimesis of dis- course. The verbal text then follows the principle of exploiting the potential of the medium in an especially close way, since language is best at imitating language. And if the text, in accordance with the lyric affinity with orality, suggests an o r a 1 discourse, an acoustic illusion may occur in addition and make up for a visual deficiency. A further compensation consists in a shift of 'pictorial' elements to another level - from the enounced to the enuncia- tion. If in narrative fiction visual elements are predominantly created by the outer reality of the 'story', in poetry they quite often are furnished by the in- ner world of the lyric persona' s consciousness, where pictorial comparisons and metaphors proliferate and generally characterize lyric enunciation. And frequently it is these images and their idiosyncracies that are also respon- sible for the impression of listening to a rather personal, 'subjective' (inner) voice, an impression which can in turn be conducive to aesthetic illusion. Thus even a rather vague and, as far as the details of the enounced are con- cerned, 'abstract' poem such as Separation contains at least two visual images: "Like thread through a needle" and "stitched with its color" - the curious comparisons of the speaker and his or her 'hollowness' after the separation with a needle and its hole, and his or her suffering and activities with a piece of cloth through which a thread is woven. Similarly, Pound's In 89 Cf. Grabes, "Wie aus Sätzen Personen werden" (see n. 42), p. 407, and his remark on the special illusionist power, "Illusionsmächtigkeit", of characters.</page><page sequence="35">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 285 a Station of the Metro illustrates the central "apparition" by a highly sub- jective visual metaphor: "Petals on a wet, black bough". The second additional difference of lyric illusion compared to other types of literary illusion consists in its tendency towards a lesser degree of intensi- ty. This is partially due to the artificiality which in poetry is always more manifest, but partially also to the fact that lyric illusion often does not have enough time to unfold. Poems are often not long enough to employ all the persuasive strategies of alluring the reader which a long narrative or dramat- ic work has at its disposal. Thus it is not by chance that Coleridge's dictum of the "willing suspension of disbelief for the moment " refers to poetry, for it is here that a willing entering the fictional world (or the consciousness of the lyric persona) 4 for a moment' only is indeed especially necessary, and that right from the start. Here again generic conventions and the resulting effect on the recipient's expectation that lyric poetry be short may help to overcome the problem presented by the tendency to brevity in most cases. In a Station of the Metro is probably a borderline case, as far as the minimal time for an unfolding of expectations and their fulfilment or disappointment is concerned, but even in this minimal poem the essential structure of experientiality and hence of textual aesthetic illusion is present. If the title is taken into account, the poem itself can be conceived of as the correction of an expectation: instead of the drab uniformity of crowds met in public places the covert lyric persona, in a sudden epiphany, unexpectedly perceives beautiful faces. 5. Breaking of illusion in lyric poetry? To say that lyric poetry, in spite of appearances, is not generically incapable of aesthetic illusion does not mean, of course, that all poems are illusionist to the same degree nor that they are necessarily illusionist. As with dramatic and narrative aesthetic illusion, lyric illusion may vary in intensity. And as with other kinds of illusion, the individual work of art itself is largely responsible for the modulation of the illusion or its undermining, if not, in some cases, its downright breaking. And similar to other genres, lyric poetry can also unfold a great variety of features and techniques which render aesthetic illusion difficult. It is not possible in the present context to discuss these features and techniques in detail, so let it suffice to mention one or two areas in which particular lyric poems can more or less prevent the creation of illusion. This is for instance the case when certain minimum conditions are not fulfilled by the text and its content.</page><page sequence="36">286 Werner Wolf The most obvious possibility of undermining or preventing illusion refers to the quality of experientiality as the prime condition of an illusionist possible world. It is usually not fulfilled - and hence no illusion can emerge - in merely argumentative, 'objective' poems or in didactic poems and aphorisms dealing with abstract notions rather than with concrete experi- ence. Apart from that, the lyric discourse can also deviate from a certain mini- mum degree of transparency and coherence in order to impede or prevent the reconstruction of elements of a possible world including speaking or thinking consciousness. While, due to allowances made for reasons of generic conventions, the range of acceptable opacity may be larger in lyric poetry than in other genres (and the same may be true of 'subjective' or visionary deviations from probability90), dadaist, aleatory or 'concrete' poems without a meaningful text certainly do not fulfil this condition of minimum transparency and coherence, and neither could this be said of ex- perimental poetry such as the poem r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r by e. e. cummings: r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r who a)s w(e loo)k upnowgath PPEGORHRASS eringint(o- aThe) :1 eA !p: S a (r rlvInG .gRrEaPsPhOs) to rea(be)rran(com)gi(e)ngly , grasshopper;91 Perhaps 'breaking illusion' is not the right word to describe the anti-illu- sionist effect of this poem, since the text does not permit the establishment of any kind of illusion in the first place92. The term may also appear to be 90 Hence the a-mimetic, 'poietic' tendency which is especially prominent in lyric poetry and leads to the fact that "[p]oetry detaches itself from any responsibility in regard to truth and reality" need not necessarily be considered an element precluding aesthetic illusion, as Thomke seems to do (cf. Thomke, "Appearance in Poetry: Lyric Illusion?" [see n. 4], p. 252). The Norton Anthology of Poetry (see n. 38), p. 1044.

One might even venture to say that lyric poetry, because of its relative brevity, does not typically possess the same flexibility of modulating in and out of aesthetic illusion as narrative fiction or drama. Thus it appears that in comparison to fiction or drama not only the range of possibilities to create aesthetic illusion is different in lyric poetry but also the genre's possibilities of 'breaking' il- lusion. Another important area in which aesthetic illusion is often undermined is heightened self-referentiality. In lyric poetry this refers to poems that are not only structurally self-referential due to metre, rhyme and recurrent word patterns, but also thematically, i.e. 'meta-lyric' poems. It is certainly a historically conditioned exaggeration to proclaim, as Baudelaire has done, "La Poésie [...] n'a pas d'autre but qu'elle même [...] et aucun poème ne sera si grand, si noble, si véritablement digne du nom de poème, que celui qui aura été écrit uniquement pour le plaisir d'écrire un poème [...]"93, yet this passage may be quoted94 as an extreme case of the general lyric tendency towards self-referentiality. This tendency is more marked than in other gen- res and is perhaps responsible for the fact that meta-lyric poetry is a particu- larly prominent sub-genre, ranging from Horace's "Exegi monumentum aere perennius [...]" and Shakespeare's "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day to Keats's Sonnet on the Sonnet , Rossetti's The Sonnet and postmo- dernist meta-lyrics. While open self-referentiality is theoretically always a problem with respect to aesthetic illusion, in practice the question as to whether aesthetic illusion is seriously impaired will depend here, as in me- tafictional narratives, on various factors such as the extent of the self- referentiality, whether it can be conceived of in terms of the experience of an easily imaginable (lyric) persona, but also to some extent on the content of the self-referentiality. A particularly interesting case in this context is the meta-lyric self- scrutiny of lyric illusion itself, that is of the capability which I have postu- lated in this essay: that lyric poetry - in spite of appearances - may 'draw the reader' into its world similar to other genres of literature and art, so that in the end the reader may 'become one' with the poem. This is at least how coherent world or by offering conflicting frames of meaning, cf. the interesting essay by McHale, "Making (non)sense of postmodernist poetry" (see n. 19, quotation p. 6), who analyses poems by John Ashbery, J. H. Prynne and Charles Bernstein. Charles Baudelaire, "Notes nouvelles sur Edgar Poe" (1857), in: Ch. B., L'Art ro- mantique. Littérature et musique , ed. by Lloyd James Austin, Paris 1968, pp. 175- 192, quotation p. 188. Cf. Thomke, "Appearance in Poetry: Lyric Illusion?"

The poem starts with a "thriller"-like parable of a self-centred "ol woman" [...] so vain she surrounded herself w/ many mirrors it got so bad that finally she locked herself indoors &amp; her whole life became the mirrors When assaulted by the villagers (unpleasant representatives of an intrusive reality), she one day escapes into one of her mirrors, like Alice 'going through the looking-glass'; and henceforth each tenant who bought the house after that 4 lost a loved one to the ol woman in the mirror : That this miraculous house of mirrors is the 'house of poetry' of which we are reading a part and that the old woman as well as the ensuing owners of the house are representatives of the recipient becomes clear in the following address to the reader: the hunger of this poem is legendary it has taken in many victims [-.] it has drawn in yr feet At the end the reader is even requested not 'to resist this poem' any longer. Yet it is too late for him anyway: this poem has yr eyes this poem has his head this poem has his arms this poem has his fingers this poem has his fingertips this poem is the reader &amp; the reader this poem At this stage a complete fusion between poem and fictional reader, a total recentering of the reader in the text-world seems to have taken place. If this (con-)fusion were completely true, aesthetic illusion, of course, would lose its aesthetic quality, which rests on a residual distance: the very distance which is mentioned in the text as the reader's 'resistance'. In contrast to what happens to the fictional addressee of the poem, Reed's self-referential text makes sure that this complete immersion does in fact</page><page sequence="39">Aesthetic Illusion in Lyric Poetry? 289 n o t take place for the real reader: in the good old meta-literary tradition of postmodernism the poem constantly draws the reader's attention to its lin- guistic status, by the foregrounding of typography and by 'incomplete' words, but above all by the fact that a thematically meta-lyric poem, which forces the reader to reflect on aesthetic illusion, at the same time destroys this very illusion, and last but not least by its final ironic twist: statistic the us bureau of missing persons report that in 1968 over 100,000 people disappeared leaving no solid clues no trace only a space in the lives of their friends95 The 'danger' of illusion is here illustrated by the suggestion that the reader himself or herself has become a "missing person" and has got lost in the house of lyric fiction. If this is an ironic exaggeration and a warning of the illusionist power of poetry from a postmodernist point of view, it is also a secret homage rendered to this power. 95 The Norton Anthology of Poetry (see n. 38), p. 1 370.</page></plain_text>
