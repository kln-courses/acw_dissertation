Montgomery1 The history of curriculum debate involving science in the United States has touched all levels and concepts of schooling. It has involved a wide spectrum of competing interests and ideas. It has helped guide the framing of concepts as complex and influential as those of progress, human nature, and the national welfare. It has been a stage on which many players have entered, spoken, left, and returned (not always in the guise of farce). Above all, it is itself something from which a great deal can be learned: for in large part any current situation stands at the apex of this long history and cannot in any sense be divorced from what it reveals about the larger place of science and learning in American consciousness. Eric Hobsbawm once wrote that "the progress of schools and universities measures that of nationalism," and that education generally is the "most conscious champion" of the state. History reveals this to be an enormous oversimplification, woefully expedient, and particularly so in the case of science. Here, in fact, nationalism itself can be revealed as a collision of many conflicting interests, myths, visions, and hopes, all of which at some point took the scientific as legitimating dais. No committed history could be so reductive. It must rather open both inward and outward, toward the past and its continued momentum. KEY WORDS: Science; education; nationalism. PHILOSOPHY AND MYTH IN AMERICAN EDUCATION There has probably never been a time in American history when ardent debate over educa- tion and its reform was absent. The curriculum of colleges and universities, in particular, has itself been a subject of more study, argument, progres- sivism, and resistance than any discipline within its purview. This, no doubt, is due to the confused but deep-seated American faith in the power of education to be all things to many intentions, be they moral, psychological, economic, political, spiritual, or intellectual. As Richard Hofstadter once put it, somewhat wryly, "The history of American educational reformers often seems to be the history of men fighting against an uncongenial ^rrespondence should be addressed to Scott Montgomery, 2014 East Mercer Street, Seattle, WA 98112. environment .... That this literature should have been one of complaint is not in itself surprising, for complaint is the burden of anyone who aims at improvement; but there is a constant undercur- rent of something close to despair" (Hofstadter, 1963, p. 301). Yet, for all its contemporary appeal, this is not quite right. If one goes back far enough, to Jefferson and Franklin for example, one finds the very opposite of lament or gloom. More than any others among the so-called founding fathers, these two men argued passionately for changes and im- provements in what was taught at the college level (no system of secondary schools existed at the time), and they did so with an optimism that one is tempted to call celebratory. At the center of their programs lay the idea of science - science as a means to strengthen the individual through love of truth, discipline, exactitude; science as a means to advance the nation economically, through technol- ogy; science as a requirement for the securing of 521 1059-O145/93/120O-O521$07.0QA) O 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">522 Montgomery political freedom through a worldly, informed, and ethical citizenry; science as a source of knowledge for building the best educational system possible; science to launch, that is, the great experiment of America, whose full task would be the Enlighten- ment dream of human perfectibility. A look at the evolution of curriculum debate since then shows that science has always held central ground as an area of concern and hope. The con- tours of rhetoric and image used to promote the study of science have changed dramatically, in fas- cinating and illuminating ways. Promoting science as an idea or vision has never been very far from selling it as a necessary object of study - or, beginning in the late 19th century, as a guiding intelligence for the very structure and method of education itself. Until quite recently, before the middle part of this century, selling it at all was intrepidly bound up with millenarian, Utopian ambitions. Indeed, if styles and eras of popularization found their reflection in the classroom, as one might expect, it was not because learning was always foremost among the minds of educators - certainly not learning for its own sake. It was more because education from the very begin- ning was viewed as a means to make and remake society itself, to form the generations of the future in a brighter and cleaner image. Much later, when ideas of psychology, efficiency, and performance did become central, following the advent of mass school- ing, the types of scientific education that emerged were no less the embodiment of larger ideals related to betterment. Whether as subject or as teacher, then, science has long been a nucleus for education in America. If the former of these roles dominated during the first century of the republic, this was perhaps be- cause the latter required a more professional stand- ing for science itself, before it could become the source of facts and principles for general institu- tional use. In either case, however, the images of sci- ence shared by various sectors of society - among the general public, amoQg scientists, among politi- cians, and among educators at all levels - were never separated from political realities of the mo- ment and formed the broader context within which the merger between science, education, and the fu- ture took place. Something more, perhaps, should be said about the American view of education in particu- lar, for it is unique, not the least when compared to Europe, and the place of science within it cannot be fully grasped without some mention of the beliefs involved. To begin by contrast, in 19th- century England, Germany, and France, to edu- cate meant primarily to train for specific social roles. Learning could provide for a stronger fu- ture only if such roles were individually obeyed and improved. In these countries, throughout the century, the curriculum was intensely classical; moreover, it ended in an extremely difficult series of exams (e.g., the baccalaureate in France, the Arbitur in Germany) meant to restrict, without mercy and with centralized political intent, all en- try into higher-level positions of sociopolitical power, especially the professions and government service. Under Napoleon, France had set the pace early on by bringing the school system within full government control. This was then imitated by Prussia, whose leaders correlated their military defeat to Napoleon accordingly. From then on, teachers and professors were state employees, po- litical appointees in a sense. Classical as it may have been, their work was nonetheless drenched in political ideology: at the university level espe- cially, the training of future leaders who would uphold and further the given aims of society was always clear and palpable. No important dissent was ever tolerated, nor did the sweep of Roman- tic sentiment or the failed revolutions of 1848 have any important impact here. Indeed, the clas- sical curriculum itself was never really contested, for a particular reason. Graduates were taught to view themselves as standing at the peak of civili- zation, as those who had absorbed and therefore nationalized the most powerful and enduring ideas of the "ancients." In concept, as in practice, education was rarely viewed in opposition to the given order of society - and even when it was, by those such as Rousseau, the demands for change were reserved for young children, bearers of nature and fragile innocence. For all others, especially university students, little was said. Higher learning was known and represented, cer- tainly revered, as an essential means for creating leaders, as a selective system to harden social re- lations that had been founded by other means. Once in place, this system came to define the idea of education in turn. There was no deep-rooted mainstream belief that equated this idea either with reform or revolution.</page><page sequence="3">Science, Education, and Republican Values 523 The early history of America, meanwhile, presents an entirely different scene. Here, from the very beginning, education is often bathed in a primordial mythology - a mythology, one might say, of conversion. Bernard Bailyn, among others, has tied this to such things as the missionary in- terests of the early colonists - the first schools in America were set up to convert the native popu- lation to Christianity - and to the forbidding hardships of wilderness life, for which there were no "prescriptive memories," no body of "reliable lore or reserves of knowledge and experience." There were also changes in family structure, including the rise of the nuclear home, that made institutional learning suspect or unacceptable as the final site for the imparting of communal civi- lization. Well before the founding of the republic, aspirations of religious community, of change, sta- bility, and reform - and, to be sure, of simple sur- vival - had all been invested in the child. More than the progeny of nature, children stood as the carriers of the immediate future, which was always uncertain. They were the means to create this fu- ture, to unburden it of the insecurities and failures of the past. Whether in Puritan New England or in 19th-century New York, formal education came to represent a replacement (and victory) by the state for the family's monopoly on the transmission of culture. It rose and expanded as the total power of the family declined. And thus education itself came to assume the child's profound moral and cultural innocence as well as his/her capacity of being trained to a new world. Education was placed both at the origin of society and against it, the means to make it and to make it over. In think- ing this way, early American reformers understood something critical: that a curriculum for learning, for the transfer of civilization, bore within it a certain blueprint vision of society, of social relations, and of the individual. The primordial myth of American education is therefore a simple one, but an enormously com- manding and unbroken one as well. Indeed, in its equating of learning with the possibility for change (whether conservative, liberal, or radical), for social and individual betterment, it is perhaps the most tra- ditional concept of all in the history of this realm. Yet exactly because of this hope for change, it has always been a territory hotly fought over by any number of competing interests. For groups of all kinds, education has been the groundspace to find legitimacy, the final site where one's voice could be entered into the mainstream (at least for a while). For the individual, too, it has been a place where one might find the means to climb out of history, beyond the bounded locale of background. For lead- ers, industrial or political, it has long signified a means to create a new economic, moral, or intellec- tual condition for this self. FRANKLIN, JEFFERSON AND THE CURRICULUM Nearly every writer and orator of the early re- public argued, in one form or another, for the es- tablishment of a distinct and distinctive American education. Major statesmen and diplomats alike had eager plans to offer for the founding of a national system of schools or colleges. As concept, as phi- losophy, and as metaphor, science (and technology) was central to nearly all such promulgations.2 Where Jefferson and Franklin put forth programs for actual scientific study, others such as Benjamin Rush hoped for an education that would turn men into "republican machines," while Thomas Paine spoke of the new country as embodying the principles of a Newtonian universe. Everywhere one cared to look, there was science, both guarantor and emblem of the "national experiment". As Lawrence Cremin has said: [T]hey [the early reformers] urged a genuinely 2It should be mentioned that the word "science" had a somewhat different meaning in Jefferson's day than at present. For leaders of the time, it generally meant a combination of what we think of today as scientific-type knowledge (of the material universe), empirical and natural philosophy (theorizing about the origins and meanings of nature, including human nature), technology/ technical methods (including, that is, not merely devices and machines, but practical processes in almost any area of expertise, from agriculture to architecture), and, according to Samuel Johnson's^ Dictionary of the Englbh Language (1755), "comprehension or understanding of truth or facts by the mind." It should also be emphasized that the word "scientist" did not exist until the late 1830s and did not become current in the United States until the 1840s. The use of it in this article is therefore a matter of historical inaccuracy for the sake of convenient meaning, in cases where such contemporary terms as "natural philosopher" would be inadequate since a more modern, professional sense is intended.</page><page sequence="4">524 Montgomery useful education, pointedly addressed to the improvement of the human condition. At its heart would be the new sciences, through which citizens might come to know the immutable laws governing nature and humankind and on the basis of which they might build a society founded on reason and conformity to moral truth .... Through the systematic application of science to every realm of living, they would learn in countless ways to enhance the dignity and quality of their daily existence . . . [1980; pp. 3-4]. Something else lay behind this grand emphasis. The desire to found a singularly American kind of education, antithetical to that which had emerged from and long supported a millennial reign of feu- dalism and tyranny in Europe, pointed immediately in the direction of science, for here was assumed to be a realm of thought and endeavor both practical in nature, therefore supportive of personal and pub- lic independence, and republican in spirit, therefore democratic in political lesson. It was a realm there- fore incognizant, even rupturing, of old world class divisions and corruptions.3 Up to that time, two types of schools existed, neither of them public. The first consisted of so- called academies. These were small, local, private in- stitutions, either Latin in focus - their sole function being to prepare young men of wealthy families for college - or else offering a more varied curriculum that intended a graduate for business or teaching. The second type, meanwhile, were the charity or pauper schools, supported by local governments for the sake of orphan or indigent children. The pur- pose here, quite evidently, was a mixture of social aims, i.e., to uplift the poor morally, instill discipline and respect for authority, reduce the possibility for crime, and provide some measure of comfort. Such schools were the closest thing to public education that had yet been conceived - and they were a long way from deserving that title in any but a rank metaphorical sense. Imagine, therefore, the radical nature of a plan such as Jefferson's, unveiled as early as the time of the revolution, and involving an entire, 3Again, Jefferson provides excellent articulation: "These [scientific] societies are always in peace, however their nations may be at war. Like the republic of letters, they form a great fraternity spreading over the whole earth, and their correspondence is never interrupted . . . Vaccination has been a late and remarkable instance of the liberal diffusion of a blessing newly discovered [letter to John Hollins, February 19, 1809]. full-fledged system of state-supported popular edu- cation, beginning with district elementary schools and progressing all the way up to a grand State Uni- versity of Virginia! Nothing so comprehensive and centralized had ever been advocated before, not even by Franklin. Jefferson's plan was intimidating in scale alone. What type of subjects did he propose for study? What type of "Republican mind" did he, and Franklin, have in view for the future, particu- larly at the higher levels? The curriculum devised by those such as Jefferson and Franklin departed sharply and inten- tionally from the standard European model of higher learning at the time. Their deviation was a simple one: in addition to the usual retinue of Latin and Greek, modern languages, history, and so on, courses in science, both "pure and useful," were to be included. In his proposal for founding a model institute of higher learning in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin laid out the following offerings: For attaining . . . great and important advantages, so far as the present State of our infant Country will admit, and laying a Foundation for Posterity . . . an academy for teaching the Latin and Greek Languages, the English Tongue ... the most useful living foreign Languages, French, German, and Spanish . . . History, Geography, Chronology, Logick and Rhetorick, Writing, Arithmetic!^ Algebra, the several Branches of the Mathematicks, Natural and Mechanick Philosophy, Drawing in Perspective, and every other useful Part of Learning and Knowledge [1749, p. 153]. The basic sentiments and plan were repeated by Franklin on many other occasions, for example, in his well-known Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania (1749) and his dedicatory speech Constitution of Phillips Academy (1778). In every case, "the first and principal object ... is the promotion of true piety and virtue," by which was meant education as a source of personal and there- fore social improvement. Emphasis was above all on those subjects that would be "most useful," on practical study that would be both "pleasant and agreeable" instead of "painful and tedious," and that would yield such students as might be "fitted for learning any business, calling, or profession." This does not mean that Franklin was a strict utilitarian. On the contrary, what he wanted was an enormous, unprecedented opening of the curricu- lum. As one historian puts it:</page><page sequence="5">Science, Education, and Republican Values 525 Indeed, he did expect education to be useful, as who did not; but his revolution consisted in the kind of utility he had in mind. He wanted subjects and instruction that trained not for limited goals, not for close-bound, predetermined careers, but for the broadest possible range of enterprise. He had no argument with the classics as such. What he objected to was their monopoly of the higher branches of education which denied the breadth of preparation needed for the open world he saw [Baflyn, 1960, p. 35]. It was not merely a new student that Franklin hoped for, in other words. What he foresaw was a new type of person, fitted for life in diverse ways, provided with a range of possibilities that had not previously existed. In education he saw directly and immedi- ately a vision of the republic itself, freed from feudal apprenticeship to Europe. It is interesting to compare these proposals with Jefferson's own curriculum for the University of Virginia, offered a full 70 years later (1818). Here, ten study areas are laid out, of which fully half are in the sciences. The hierarchy, too, is revealing: after "languages, ancient" and "languages, modern," the next five are all devoted to science ("mathematics, pure," "physicomathematics," "physics, chemistry, mineralogy," "botany, zoology," "anatomy, medi- cine"), with the last three areas being taken up by "government, political economy," "law, municipal," and finally a hodgepodge category of "ideology, gen- eral grammar, ethics, rhetoric, belles lettres, and the fine arts." Jefferson's program differed from Franklin's in that it was less focused on "the useful arts" (although it included many, from agriculture to military forti- fication), yet gave central stage to the sciences as a whole. For Jefferson, it would seem, the study of sci- ence should precede or guide the study of politics, history, law, and civic knowledge as a whole. This was because, in contrast to Franklin, for whom science was most important to the degree of its "usefulness," Jefferson more directly shared the Enlightenment idea of (and belief in) science as representing a kind of grand and utopic teleology, finally set in motion by humankind's fundamental desire for progress. TTiis meant science as a combination of intellectual, moral, and spiritual methodologies whose ultimate end and aim were nothing less than the perfectibility of the individual and therefore society. It was within this frame, then, that freedom for Jefferson could qualify as "the first-born daughter of science." SCIENCE AND ADVANTAGE During the period spanned by these two cur- ricular proposals - a period that both preceded and included the revolution, its aftermath, as well as an- other war with England - science came to be at- tached to an enormous range of republican virtues and values. The language surrounding these ideas and feelings has, one might argue, set the basic scheme of debate ever since, down to the present day (although of course in varied form). For this reason, it is important to list the principal advan- tages science was thought to aid or empower. Five, in particular, are notable: 1. Pragmatic Advantage. Science, in the form of Franklin's "useful arts," was promoted as a subject of learning for the sake of work, for improving individual and collective productivity and wealth, for "fitting" one to an "advantageous life." Farmers, in whom a great deal was invested, both spiritually and materi- ally, were particular targets of this rationale. Agricul- ture was viewed as well by Jefferson, John Adams, and a host of others as the "genius of America" (it had been, in fact, along with the supply of raw ma- terials such as lumber and coal, the pillar of the American economy up until the revolution). Soon, however, a growing number of scientists, mill owners, and manufacturers began to strongly lobby for science education on the basis that it would enhance indus- trial commerce and therefore opportunities for em- ployment and personal economic advancement. Adams himself quickly added his voice to this lobby (he would argue on behalf of scientific education all his life), and in doing so, revealed an investing of sci- ence with the fundamental virtues of the work ethic that would become so central to American self- mythology in the next century: "manufactures," he said, "cannot live, much less thrive, without honor, fi- delity, punctuality, and private faith, a sacred respect for property, and the moral obligations of promises and contracts." (quoted in Gutman, 1976). A government "decisive, as well as ... intelligent and honest" could promote these virtues, but only if it took science to heart, making it the focus of its vision, and of a "new education" for the American citizenry. 2. National Advantage. The training of engi- neers, architects, inventors, and industrialists was promoted by many leaders for purposes of national economic independence, for freeing the new nation from a well-recognized and somewhat humiliating</page><page sequence="6">526 Montgomery dependence on foreign expertise and goods, especially from Britain. This new native corps would promote fuller employment at home, a higher degree of loyalty and dedication (workers would more gladly devote themselves to productive labor under American experts, rather than foreign ones), and would therefore greatly further the needed improvements in both trade and pa- triotic duty. Encouraging education in science and tech- nology was thus seen as a way to directly aid domestic manufacturers; and thereby to provide a vital and long- term defense, a kind of solidification of the republican venture itself.4 3. Moral Advantage. As implied in the passages from Jefferson, science and "scientific thinking" were viewed as encouraging the betterment of individual character in many ways. Honesty, patience, discipline, observation, civility, and industriousness - 'Virtue," in other words, in all its Protestant forms - were fre- quently mentioned as the probable, even the more in- evitable result of "a solid grounding in the sciences of man" (Thomas Paine). Interesting to note here, as dis- cussed by Kasson (1976), is how Britain and Europe - and later, the opportunities for wealth that America was itself creating - became associated with "luxury and dissolution," "extravagance," and the like, all to which the "firmness" and "progressive spirit" of sci- ence could act as antidote by gaining for the individual a more solid control over "the power of instinct."5 4During much of the revolutionary period, colonists were subjected to British embargoes or were urged not to buy British goods. The result was a period of distinct austerity. After the war, ironically, trade was quickly reestablished and a flood of English products entered the United States. The British, meanwhile, sought revenge against the American victory and to head off possible competition by closing many of their own markets to American goods, thus enhancing the economic imbalance through severe trade restriction. 5See Kasson (1976, pp. 36-40). In this connection, it is also important to point out the dear preoccupation that colonial leaders had with the idea of power, its origin, meaning, and control. Power was viewed as a potential evil, a temptation toward self-aggrandizement, if not legitimately guided by forms of mutual consent The images used to describe it were almost wholly anthropomorphic or biologic: k "trespassed," "encroached"; it resembled devouring "jaws," a "cancer," a "seizing hand" (see the excellent discussion in Bernard Baflyn's (1967) classic study The Ideological Origins of the American Rewhrion, especially pp. 55-63). Such organic images - fixed on a kind of unleashed and savage vitality -were then directly countered by a civilizing political imagery of restraint and control attributed to science, which was spoken of as a "republic" dictated by "reason" or a "fraternity" governed by universal rules of demonstration and allegiance to shared goals. 4. Republican Idealism. In this category is to be counted the association, on the level of spirit and sensibility, between science and such things as lib- erty, inevitable progress, and human perfectibility. This, as we have said, came largely out of Enlight- enment belief (especially France), but it was adapted to the republican cause in particular. Science meant revolution, new forms of openness, exploration, a glorious victory over the prejudices and tyrannies of the past: the new nation, America, was to be the embodiment of its great intellectual quest on the plains of political reality. 5. Pastoralism. This is perhaps the most com- plex and interesting category of all. In fact, however, there had already been, before the time of the revo- lution, an extensive tradition of colonial thought and writing that had seen in America the idea of "Nature's nation."6 Within the old capitols of Europe lay the rotted fruits of inequality, squalor, indolence, con- finement; the New World, by contrast, was full of an Eden-like fertility, an unspoiled and magnificent scale, a Utopian "plenty." Certain forms of goodness and vigor, both personal and social, were thought to come from direct contact with such a unique natural environment. A special love of country, dedication to the land, a willingness to think large, to work hard and generously for self, for one's neighbor, and for communal welfare too; such were among the pieties often cited. During the early and mid 19th century, this evolved into the concept of an American nature, scientifically distinct from that of Europe. Thomas Say, a well-known entomologist of the early republic, rejected the older Linnaean system of taxonomy out of hand; his "intensely nationalistic goal of estab- lishing the authority of American scientists to name and describe the flora and fauna of their own country placed him squarely in the mainstream of postrevo- lutionary thinking" (Stroud, 1992, p. 3-4). More broadly, certain scientific subjects - in particular, botany, zoology, geography, and geology - were recommended for both academic and popu- lar (self-) learning in order that citizens become di- rectly acquainted with the native wonders and natural lessons of the republic. Well into the 19th century, it was common to hear educators, secular and Christian alike, argue for study in these areas 6The phrase is Jefferson's; see his Notes on the State of Virginia (1787).</page><page sequence="7">Science, Education, and Republican Values 527 on the basis that American values and virtues lay written in the native landscape, that size and gran- deur, hardiness, the lure to greatness were all to be culled from a familiarity with "the face of God's chosen land." A great deal of the same thing can also be seen in American painting between 1830 and 1880, the uncontested age of national (and na- tionalist) landscape (see, for example, Novack, 1980). Thus the demand for clear powers of obser- vation, revealing of the national superlative, was equally shared between art and science, both of which partook of the literacy of "Nature's nation." In this way, then, the pastoral ideal in revolution- ary America became later transformed into an ar- gument for scientific study as a kind of political nature worship. These five categories, of course, stand as arti- ficial divides in what was a heady and unmitigated flow of overlapping favoritisms. Moral, political, and practical sentiments aimed at the heroification of the republic through science (and therefore, science through the republic) tended to entwine like sepa- rate tributaries of a single vast current. Those who strongly advocated scientific study commonly spoke of the need to promote such things as industry, thrift, temperance, and self-denial, to battle against any erosions, perceived or foreseeable, in character, learning, and nationhood. Most leaders at the time, being intellectuals and writers as well as politicians, scarcely made any real distinctions between these latter areas, but the promotion of science also came because of something inherent in the very idea of education: namely, that this process was formative in the most profound of ways, not only for "creating the mature individual" (as Horace Mann later put it) but for enabling him to go even beyond the his- toric limitations of his nature. Science, as cup-bearer of reason, could not but be central to such a way of thought. All in all, then, science was an idea grandly and vaguely encompassing. It was like a flag picked up and waved by many eager hands. Jeffersonian idealists could use it to argue for a learned citizenry, conservatives, such as John Adams, to promote a mixture of self-restraint and inventiveness, radicals such as Paine, schooled in Scottish common sense philosophy, could find in it the proof of a deistic universe that denied any final authority for the church and confirmed the evil of aristocracy in any form. Manufacturers, meanwhile, interested in profit and expansion, could expound on the beneficence of science with regard to progress and national independence. Still others might speak of its use for the building and rebuilding of the nation itself (with which such disciplines as physics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine were correlated). The images sur- rounding science, therefore, were very often the same as those enveloping the idea of the republic itself, both physically and spiritually. PHILOSOPHICAL AND CURRICULAR TRADITIONS Within the bounds of these multiform ration- ales, guiding them forward in the area of actual educational policy, were three traditions, one an- cient, the other two relatively new. These traditions have remained in place ever since; indeed, their vi- sions of learning, of the power and place of educa- tion, therefore of the ideal individual and his/her collective society, are more evident today than they ever have been, for a host of reasons. Two of these traditions, what I have called Academism and Prac- ticalism, had much of their basic philosophy and discourse hardened early on and have remained part of the educative landscape ever since. The third tradition, Reformism, is different in crucial ways. Its values have been revolutionary, even radi- cal (when viewed from the status quo perspective), rising out of active disillusionment during times when a general shift occurs away from obedient faith in given institutions toward a more person- centered, utopic view of society. As such, it has punctuated rather than led the history of American education. Yet its ideals are in large part the most democratic of all. What follows, then, is a brief description of each of these central traditions. Academism can be defined as the oldest edu- cative philosophy in western culture. It can be cor- related in large part with the basic mode of "ivory tower" or Old World liberal arts learning. As im- planted in America, this tradition was maturely de- veloped in England and France during the era of</page><page sequence="8">528 Montgomery growing empire (16th-17th centuries).7 It came from a system of higher learning immediately adapted to the strengthening and perpetuating of monarchical government and its serving elite, being aimed at the training - psychologically, linguistically, as well as educatively - of a stratum of "higher" individuals. In the beginning, it was derived directly from me- dieval educational structures, in which learning was based on the auctores system, the reading and im- bibing of canonical authors chosen as the providers of timeless, fundamental wisdom. A "great ideas" education believed itself based on close contact be- tween the individual mind and the "great book" - the tutor-pupil relationship, in a transferred setting. Granted, this was an ideal, not so often achieved (much of medieval learning, based as it was upon strict memorization, more closely resembled manual labor), but in the courtly societies of 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century Europe, when the universities were filled with the sons of more wealthy patrons, and when the idea of "select intellects" (Comenius), whether destined for politics or scholarship, came to the fore, the feeling of a need to "learn from leaders of the mind" (Francis Bacon) became fully attached to the liberal arts. In social terms, canonical works were the ves- sels by which Greek learning, in particular, had been appropriated to the European as the embodiment of Western (read: advanced) culture as a whole. That a great deal of this learning had come to Europe via translation from Arabic sources in the 12th and 13th centuries was largely, if not totally, forgotten. In fact, the forgetting of debts to Islamic civilization was commensurate with the adoption of the new knowledge into the old auctores system and its use in the building of the new universities after 1200. These were originally set up throughout Europe on the basis of a guild-type structure, then developing within the major trades. As summarized by Lindberg (1992), they aimed at "self-government and monopoly": to accomplish this meant to ensure a restricted, chosen collegiate, and this involved the setting up of a layered series of exams, a tutorship system, and a high level of patronage from kings, 7Here, one might note certain long-term connections. This type of study, focusing on a fixed series of sacred texts, was prevalent throughout the Western world during this period and was itself a direct outgrowth and continuation of the auricular standards created during the later Middle Ages. These standards, in turn, were themselves derived from an earlier monastic tradition, merging exegesis of the Bible with that of a selective grouping of canonical classical auctores. The basis for this tradition, meanwhile, was the Christianization of classical learning itself, whose purpose was the pursuit of virtue and whose teaching, during the declining years of the Roman Empire, was divided into the so-called liberal arts. As defined within the medieval university, these arts, in order of hierarchical importance, were the following: grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic (known as the trivium, or three ways), and arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (the quadrivium). The origin of the word "liberal" with regard to these disciplines remains obscure. Nonetheless, it came to have a specific meaning for medieval authors and teachers. As noted by Hugh of St. Victor (early 12th century), for example, study of these "arts" required a mind that was liberated from worldly concerns; moreover, "only free and noble men were accustomed to study them, while the populace and the sons of men not free sought operative skill in things mechanical." (quoted in James Bowen, A History of Western Education, Volume 2, 1975, p. 64). A more blunt way of putting this is offered by Ernst Robert Curtius, who states that the liberal arts were "studies whose purpose is not to make money. They are called liberal because they are worthy of a free man." {European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, 1953; p. 37). Freedom, in short, was conceived within this tradition as a matter of removal and elevation from common problems of life, something that, during the late Roman period, was connected to an understanding of ubiquitous corruption and degeneration and that later was attached to belief in the ultimate importance and virtue of contemplation. The original scheme for the liberal arts seems to have been set down by Varro in the 3rd century BC, at which point architecture and medicine were also included. These disciplines, however, were later felt to be overly linked to "operative skill in things mechanical" and were dropped. The seven that remained were thus the purest of all. Though their end purpose may well have been reflection of a higher type, they nonetheless came to serve magnificently well a new era of empire-building and expansion, with its greatly increased court and its need for a restricted elite of courtiers, diplomats, loyal aristocrats, and others who commanded the powers of language and persuasion. It should be noted, finally, that "science" remained toward the bottom of the liberal arts curriculum, and was in any case dominated by classical mathematics. Indeed, historians have pointed out, the idea of science as such did not yet exist, but had to develop outside the university system (Ross, 1991). Francis Bacon, of course, is the prime example here; but the majority of his followers in the Royal Society of London were also of nonacademic professions. Powerful as their influence was, the ideas they framed were taken into the universities according to existing categories: Science became part of the arts curriculum and was steeped in its teaching with a mixture of philosophy, rhetoric, classical languages, and so on. Anything vocational, meanwhile, anything of the manual arts was strictly omitted. The sense that the mechanical arts were illiberal never waned and reflects the long-term conservatism of university learning, which from the very beginning preferred to heroify itself through the image of the elite free man, always in opposition to those not free who, in the end, were tainted by everyday concerns - those, to be sure, that provided the material base for the liberal mind to exist.</page><page sequence="9">Science, Education, and Republican Values 529 popes, and princes, all of whom came to view the universities as vital assets, centers of both spiritual and worldly power, which needed to be carefully nurtured. Elements that challenged or denied the preeminence of such patronage, such as a Muslim auctore, were gradually extirpated. The idea of "higher" with regard to this kind of education, as well as its selective, earned character, thus came to be institutionalized on several levels at once - behind every claim for an elevated pursuit of learn- ing lay a very concrete, real-world structure of po- litical force and protectionism, one with its own motives for self-elevation. By the Renaissance and after, the university had become the major institution of learning, with its guild-type structure firmly in place (as it remains, in large part, today). Socioculturally, it did not cre- ate a division of knowledge from life, but rather a contouring of knowledge for specific types of elitist life and practice. These, one could say, were con- cerned with leadership in an imperial, colonialist pe- riod of national expansion. Education was aimed at the training of statesmen in arts and politics, those for whom the image of select geniuses - monarchs of the mind, so to speak - was of obvious utility in providing both a model and a promise of induction into hallowed superiorities. Over time, the indige- nous political-cultural contents of such an education came to be denied on the basis that "higher/* "uni- versal" truth was being served (still later, this be- came a basis for the idea of "academic freedom"), but the real essence has always been to produce a kind of intellect that embodies ideas of titled supe- riority and entitled stewardship, an intellect not so much capable of critiquing as personifying forms and assumptions of authority. For this reason, the academist tradition has, of necessity, granted privi- lege to the curriculum first (canonical wisdom), the teacher second (representative of such wisdom), and the student last (as novitiate). Often enough, in its various arguments for reform, it has left out the middle term altogether: such is the presumed power of a canon that it requires only a messenger, not a true teacher. Not ironically, science was long given a re- duced importance, a more or less secondary role, within the limits of this tradition. The reason for this is fairly straightforward. The ideal individual, en- coded within the liberal arts curriculum, was he who commanded maximal powers vis-&amp;-vis language, its forms and uses, both written and verbal; such, after all, was the substance of leadership at the time in art and politics.8 With the exception of natural philosophy, sci- ence did not fit well into this paradigm at first, being overly linked with the "practical arts." Indeed, for the majority of its history, science grew up outside the university system altogether. Only later, once sci- entists had themselves taken on the robe of higher truth - through such notions as objectivity and dis- interest, therefore claiming complete removal from the rest of culture - was acceptance forthcoming (and then only slowly). This, then, defines the second and more mod- ern tradition of academist belief, this historical ac- commodation. Such notions as dispassion, after all, were by no means unique to science. By claiming them as their own, scientists were adapting a given rhetoric to a new purpose. Their success was enor- mous, their knowledge seemed to prove such claims- making. Very soon, any connections to the older Academism were lost or ignored. All of the colleges founded during the prerevo- lutionary period in America were based directly on this older tradition, imported from England. To be counted among these are Harvard, Dartmouth, King's College (later Columbia), William and Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), among others. These institutions, indoctrinated into the sensibility of their origins, largely resisted any broadening of scientific curricula after the revolu- tion and into the 1820s. At that point, certain pure science courses were established or expanded; it re- quired another half-centuiy or more, in the wake of both the Civil War and the looming example of the new research university and its effects, before any- thing approaching a conversion to the new Acade- mism was grudgingly established. Practicalism, which has stood both in opposi- tion and agreement to Academism, has been more or less intimated in silhouette by the discussion of Franklinian education above. Simply put, it holds in priority the notion of education as a source of practical advancement, whether of the nation, of industry, or of the individual. Often, this has meant the idea that education should be directly con- nected with the life and needs of ordinary society 8Indeed, as Nietzsche once said, nearly the entire foundation of knowledge, an for that matter political power, was often still based during this time on modes o 'persuasion', of constructing and imposing territories of belief, obedience, and truth.</page><page sequence="10">530 Montgomery - by which is usually meant economic opportunity for middle- and working-class people. Thus, both for the individual and for industry, it has often sup- ported the idea that forms of vocational education should be thoroughly taken up by schooling, that in fact the system of public schools (once it came to exist) had a duty to do so. Alternately, however, the idea of practical benefit has made for demands of a more general and (often) unfocused nature, for example, that higher learning serve the nation or national interest with regard to such things as economic competitiveness, military power, or inter- national prestige, and that it contribute to, and even be guided by, the needs of U.S. commercial venture. As a result, Practicalism with regard to scien- tific education has usually been directly oriented to- ward technology and the so-called fruits of science. Yet in its nationalist mode, it has frequently made use of Academist images of science, particularly during eras when these images have commanded general belief, arguing the logic that pure science will always be in some way American and will serve American interests, when conducted within American borders. At times, this tradition holds within it a view of the nonelitist individual, the average person (however defined) whose station in life can be ad- vanced by certain types of learning. Yet when it comes to nationalist ambitions, to goals such as com- petitiveness or technological supremacy, the demand has tended to focus readily on expanding the num- ber of experts in society, therefore on the need for an intellectual plutocracy. With regard to scientific education for industry and the national interest, starting in the latter half of the 19th century, Prac- ticalism frequently conceived the individual in terms of manpower or human resources, i.e., as a type of commodity to be consumed by larger purposes, com- monly those of profit, imperialism, and international power. With regard to education, therefore, Practical- ism has often argued for forms of popularization, for opening the doors to larger numbers of stu- dents. It is not aimed at reforming or bettering so- ciety in any large sense, but instead in reforming education to give added strength to existing forms of institutional authority and to develop and em- power new ones. For these and other reasons, this tradition has also tended to elevate curriculum and teacher above the student. Its model graduate is, to put it simply, a soldier of knowledge - someone who will apply his or her expertise toward a com- bination of personal advantage and institutional purpose. Reformism, the last tradition, has tended to view education very differently from either Practi- calism or Academism (although it has often included the latter's images of science). The truest proponent of Reformism, and in many ways its historical spokesperson, is John Dewey, who viewed education as including a broad range of activities in society and who saw school as a living experience, one whose fundamental job was to connect life within the class- room to life outside in the everyday world. (In fact, there is always a connection in some sense; educa- tion always reflects the society in which it occurs: Academism reflects the continuing class structure of modern society, Practicalism both the struggle be- tween classes for economic equality and the efforts of industry and government to control such strug- gle.) Perhaps better said, Reformism has wanted to take this connection in hand, give it form within the school, and direct it toward social change for a more democratic way of life. Philosophically, this tradition is the exact inverse of Academism: at the top is the student, whose needs with regard to learning-as-a-process are always first; then comes the teacher, who educates through interaction with the student (an equal participant); last is the curriculum itself, whose basic contents remain essential but whose form is to be extremely flexible, always open to experiment and change. The ideal individual embodied within this scheme is one who will embark on a path (in Dewey's words) of education for life, meaning edu- cation as a never-ending process, without any nec- essary aim toward practical gain. Reformism, in many ways, is the expression of a rebellion against Academist claims in Amer- ica. It is, perhaps, the inevitable outcome of a com- mitted tradition of democratic belief within a society where higher learning long remained the training ground for upper-class privilege. It reflects most pointedly a sense that learning always repre- sents a source and a beginning, an opportunity for something new and better to be created. At the heart of Reformism, then, is not the ideal individ- ual as statesman or elegant mind, fit to enter the ranks of the chosen, but as empowered common man, capable of choosing and creating choice with</page><page sequence="11">Science, Education, and Republican Values 531 regard to "the tasks of a customary existence" (Franklin). It is this individual, whose precise defi- nition has proved so difficult, so malleable, so ame- nable to appropriation by any number of interests - from hopeful Utopians to conservative govern- ment ideologues - that has helped lend this tradi- tion its aspect of experimentalism, its sometime lack of coherence, and its continued search for dis- covering and (re)shaping approaches to learning that are exclusively American. Science has very often held a place of honor within the reformist tradition, from Dewey on- ward. This place has been a troubled and often vague one, being centered on ideas of science for democracy and science for a better world, but such ideas, naive as they might have been, harken back to Jefferson directly, to his belief in the pos- sibility for a battle against tyranny waged through learning. In fact, all three of these traditions, together, have a complex and interwoven history of relation- ship with ideas about science and its educative worth. At some points in the past, such ideas, current among the public and among powerful in- dividuals, have given direct nourishment to one of these traditions over the others (e.g., the science for national defense movement of the 1950s and 1960s, which strongly favored Academist concepts of pure science). At other times, proponents of one tradi- tion have adopted as sacred certain images more endemic to an opposing tradition (e.g., Progressive reformers of the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, who faith- fully took up positivist notions of a detached and objective, i.e., an academist, science). Doctrine and dogma have never been lacking in any of these tra- ditions, nor have fear and hope as their motivating passions. During the whole of the 19th century, Aca- demism held sway in secondary education, a tra- ditional Academism that favored the humanities over the sciences. Only within the final two dec- ades, the 1880s and 1890s, when such schooling had become compulsory and when scientific knowledge had been fully invested with ideas of progress and national power, did science gain full adoption. During the Progressive era, meanwhile, the curriculum changed radically, according to mainly Practicalist (but also Reformist) rationale: vocational courses, training in personal hygiene, ethical character, and the like became standard and remained so until the late 1950s, when the Sputnik aftermath encouraged a swing back to- wards more academist programs - now, however, with the sciences in the forefront. For higher education, the story is somewhat different. During nearly the whole of the 19th century, higher education in the United States was dictated by the commands first of traditional Academism, while the old colleges held power, and then later, with the full rise of the research university, by a re- formed type of Academist sensibility that saw in sci- ence above all the highest, most removed and pure form of cerebral work - a work based on contribu- tion, on the forward movement of knowledge, on progress therefore transferred to the intellectual realm. This was mixed, too, with a growth in Practicalist-oriented higher learning, found predomi- nantly in technical schools and in engineering de- partments of the expanding universities. In our own century, meanwhile, changes of emphasis have taken place, but it does seem clear, indeed all too clear, that in terms of actual teaching, it has been the Aca- demist tradition that has held sway in science and that only with the coming of the late 1960s and early 1970s did a truly new, Reformist image of science rise to the surface, yielding new voices of critique, new possibilities for content. Each era was formative in terms both of what it did for (or to) education and also in what it said. The rationale for programs of change or stability, for certain types of curriculum and not others, and for the uses of education are as central to any study of American learning as the schools themselves. For the 19th century, it is interesting to note how, during almost the whole of this time, there existed a subtle division between two fundamental points of view. One of these emerged to promote the idea of America and democracy through arts, letters, and politics (Adams, Hamilton, and other conservatives); the other argued for freedom through politics, science, and the arts (Jefferson, Rush, and others). This was not at all an early version of the two-cultures debate, i.e., the split between the humanities and sciences. It was more a matter of emphasis: for those who held ardent faith in the benefits of the classics, sci- ence was distinctly less important as far as the train- ing of sensibility was concerned. For those, on the other hand, who gave privilege to progress and as- sociated it with the securing of democracy, these</page><page sequence="12">532 Montgomery classics were necessary in that they accorded one the ability to know and understand the past, to learn its lessons and enjoy its beauties, but for the future there was science, and thus science for the future. The hostility between these points of view grew up within the academy, not outside it. It was a rivalry born of power struggles, as an older order, medieval in spirit, began to fall before the modern, but the fall has never been complete, and the struggle never resolved. Inasmuch as it continues today, it relives in part the debate between Jefferson and Adams, between the possibility for an uplifted citizenry and the need for a mandarin leadership. SCIENCE AND THE COLLEGES IN THE NEW REPUBLIC The double view of republican science, involv- ing a composed look backward and an excited one forward, did not last. Despite the multiform claims and demands launched for science in the immediate postrevolutionary era, especially for its future role in education building, no such widespread reforms took place for as much as a half-century afterward. The sentiments of Jefferson and Franklin had been shared by many on the level of idealism and public image, especially in the heat of uplifted national consciousness. During the early decades of the re- public, newspapers and other periodicals often car- ried articles about scientific matters that drew many correlations between patriotic virtue and the knowl- edge and outlook of science (see, for example, Beaver, 1971), but in reality, both state and federal governments, and certainly the colleges above all, continued to remain almost entirely in the hands of men whose sensibilities had been trained in 18th- century academist traditions, whether in England or at home - traditions in which science had come to play a role, certainly, but one whose significance re- mained minor, even expendable, in practice. Despite decades of effort, Jefferson failed to put through his own scheme for a public school system in Virginia. Franklin's academy in Philadelphia became, in the end, a victim to lack of interest and strife among religious factions. Revolutionary fever faded quickly in the new republic. There were economic, diplomatic, and military crises of an immediate nature to face. Prac- tical needs and demands thus came to the fore. In such a climate, the colleges were largely left to themselves. Their sense of mission remained firm, but society had changed around them. The nourish- ing environment of colonialism, with its monarchical substructure, was now gone. Prerevolutionary in their philosophy and curricula, these institutions re- sisted change and remained, in large part, anachro- nistic. Enrollments remained low, money tight, and connections to the life of the new society meager at best. A century later, Henry Adams would look back on the year 1800 and describe its intellectual life as "picturesque, but not encouraging." Harvard, and the colleges in general, "resembled a priesthood which had lost the secret of its mysteries, and pa- tiently stood holding the flickering torch before cold altars." This is not to say that change was altogether absent, nor was the curriculum itself wholly fixed and inflexible. Even before the period of major re- form beginning in the 1820s (when the colleges were attacked for being aristocratic), scientific dis- ciplines such as natural history, botany, mineralogy, and chemistry had been added in most of the schools of higher learning, but in practice these fields were of minor and unstable status. In terms of teaching, for example, science was handled in one of several ways that directly betrayed this minority importance. Often, it was a secondary assignment given to professors of mathematics or philosophy. In other cases, it was a seasonal job offered to local doctors who then filled in as part-time lecturers. In both instances, the lack of financial support - whether from the federal government (nonexistent at this time), from higher enrollments (equally un- likely), or from wealthy donors (not yet forthcoming) - meant that there was a tendency to have most or all scientific fields taught by the same individual, whose position was far from secure on a year-to- year basis.9 9An important exception to this absence of patronage was Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford), who made at least two important endowments during these years: the first, in 1796, a gift of $5000, to be set up in trust to the newly established American Academy of Arts and Sciences for the sake of research into the nature of heat and light; the second, in 1815, a willed fund of $1000 to Harvard for establishing a course of lectures aimed at teaching "the utility of the physical and mathematical sciences for the improvement of the useful arts, and for the extension of the industry, prosperity, happiness, and well-being of society." The Harvard chair was filled by a physician (Jacob Bigelow, popularizer of the term "technology"), the closest thing to a professional scientist at the time.</page><page sequence="13">Science, Education, and Republican Values 533 A few exceptions did exist: in the late 1790s, at the strong urging of Benjamin Rush, a position of solid standing had been created at Princeton (then the College of New Jersey) for John Maclean, as America's first professor of chemistry. Maclean published regularly, gained stature as an experi- menter, and attracted students to the college - thus, in a sense, providing an early model for the profes- sional academic scientist. Yet his importance was strongly attendant on the fact that he was not an American. He was Scottish, had studied at Edinburgh and Paris (where he met Lavoisier), had taught sur- gery at the University of Glasgow, and was therefore a well-established academic European before emi- grating to Philadelphia in 1795. He thus brought the cosmopolitanism and advanced status of European science to American soil, and as such, represented a rare catch (one, nonetheless, whose securing still re- quired the intervention of a prominent leader such as Rush). Yet even this did not permit him escape from the fate of his contemporaries: originally appointed to teach mathematics and natural philosophy, he had to bargain his way into gaining permission to offer chemistry and natural history as well. Thus, he became, in name and effect, the college's single pro- fessor of science. Nearly everywhere else, the situation was far more tenuous. As one historian of the era has de- scribed it: The science professor, to apply the term loosely, was at best a peripheral entity in the collegiate organization .... His salary was uniformly lower than that of other professors, and his security such that he easily fitted the classic mold of the "last hired and the first fired." . . . Those who had positions as professors spent the opening years of the century listening to students recite passages from textbooks whose copyright or composition dated from colonial times. Lecturing, or the presentation of explanations not contained in the textbooks, was a comparatively new and little used technique. Generally unassisted by laboratory apparatus of any kind, these men performed no experiments either for the benefit of their pupils or for their own intellectual advancement [Guralnick, 1975, p. 142]. One should note that the sciences were not shunned or resisted by the existing academic elite. On the one hand, as mentioned, they were already a relatively established, if minor, part of the curricu- lum by this time. They had been slowly adopted since the 1740s and 1750s, when the few colleges that then existed had undergone some degree of self-reform on the basis of models provided by the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow (this was especially true of William and Mary, where Jefferson had gone). In the first two decades following the revolution, when vari- ous types of surveys were undertaken to catalog and claim the new nation, schools such as Harvard, The University of Pennsylvania, and Columbia set up lec- tures in disciplines such as botany and natural his- tory. It was also the case that a number of the medical schools then attached to the colleges argued consistently for the addition of courses in the new sciences, in the cause of updating instruction to mod- ern levels. Both before and after 1800, there was no or- ganized or systematic resistance against science in American academia, either from classicists or from clerics. Even during the early years of the Second Awakening, when religious fervor reentered the col- leges, science was never an issue for resistance. Some, such as Yale President Timothy Dwight, stood adamantly opposed to certain strains of Enlightenment and early Romantic belief, such as the French phi- losophes and Rousseau's natural man, and thus oc- cupied a position in some part against atheistic science (which Jefferson was sometimes considered to represent), but the problem was never science per se, but rather its ultimate meaning. Atheist science was simply countered by a godly science for most Americans. As exemplified by Benjamin Silliman, another early professor of chemistry (at Yale), tech- nical knowledge and devout Protestantism melded easily in the idea that facts and causes in the material world were "the moral agencies of the Almighty," revealing "the character of the Creator as seen in his works." Yet, although neither scorned nor banished, science was not greeted by anything resembling whole-hearted embrasure either. Ideals regarding the benefits of technical knowledge had not yet be- come the transformational force that they had in France, Germany, Edinburgh, and elsewhere. They were the province of individuals, not institutions in America, where the colleges simply remained too small, too provincial, and too obedient to the Latin- Greek primordium, with its medieval emphasis on learning as the province of eternal wisdom, to open their doors fully, or even halfway, to a series of new disciplines with real-world importance. Indeed, the ironic fact seems to be that science as a whole sim- ply was not considered important enough by aca- demics of the day for it to become a point of major controversy or consistent interest.</page><page sequence="14">534 Montgomery This uncertain status reflected, therefore, a larger philosophical ambiguity with regard to the traditional liberal arts. Because of its discourse of fact, scientific thought could be adapted to the Academist view: it did not compete fundamentally with the ultimate goal of keeping the liberal mind "necessarily free from all study of practical land" (Jeremiah Day, Dwight's successor at Yale). Yet throughout the revolutionary and immediate post- revolutionary period, science had been promoted among nonacademics - especially politicians, but by scientists too - for its utilitarian powers. Whether the issue was the founding of an observatory or the promo- tion of a native genius such as self-taught astronomer and mathematician David Rittenhouse, the advances promised nearly always came under the banner of "Abilities, speculative as well as practical, [that] would do Honour to any Country." (See Hindle, 1956, p. 168.) No doubt the rhetoric that had succeeded in connecting science with revolutionary ideals contributed here as well. In one form or another, technical knowledge had been wedded to the notion of rendering nature into the hands of mankind. Thus its purity was at every step col- ored by the call to utility. Accepted by the colleges for its devotion to truth, science nonetheless warranted a peripheral place because of its lower connections to so- cial existence. This acceptance, moreover, took the form of absorption into, not simply addition to, the existing liberal arts. Rather than being allowed styles of instruction fitted to their own knowledge and methods, these disciplines were taught in the same way as non- scientific subjects. One learned physics in the identical manner that one learned Greek or rhetoric, through oral and written recitation that attempted to inculcate styles of written and spoken eloquence. True, there might be demonstrations using some form of labora- tory equipment (such as it was). There might also be study devoted to various types of specimens, perhaps, on rare occasion, an evening spent with the stars, but this was all subservient to, in fact directed toward, the basic classroom demand for standard memori- zation, rote repetition of given information, and the ability to express oneself properly, in language be- fitting a student of higher pursuits. Anything resem- bling an interactive, experience-oriented type of teaching was almost entirely lacking.10 Moreover, students were often required to read, in untranslated form, various canonical authors who had written on scientific subjects in Greek and Latin, e.g., Aristotle, Plato, Copernicus, Linnaeus, and so forth. This meant in effect (as Thomas Huxley once noted) that pupils had to be classicists first before they could even begin a study of technical knowledge. This was a distinct holdover from the medieval and Ren- aissance university, and it remained true for Europe as a whole. But in France and in Germany, such study was confined to the earlier years of college work; dur- ing the first half of the 19th century, it was increasingly succeeded by laboratory training, learning in experi- mental procedure, and other aspects of what was al- ready coming to be known as Natwwissenschaft, i.e., basic science. This did not happen in the United States until much later. Although such terms as pure and mixed were used with regard to technical knowledge, science as a whole remained without any real inde- pendent status, either intellectually or practically. It commanded no separate loyalties and was not even regularly taught in most institutions until the mid to late 1820s. Overall, there was simply no such thing as a scientific education in America, no courses whatso- ever in experimental study, no scientific degrees granted. Even Franklin's own Public Academy in Philadelphia, founded in 1756 to help further the useful arts, had all of its engineering courses expunged by 1811, with everything scientific banished to the senior year, where only a few token fields remained (astronomy, basic principles of chemistry and, of course - given the founder - electricity). 10A humorous yet telling anecdote of a classroom science demonstration at this time - indicating in some part the often-ridiculed image of the science professor, the role of the student as passive observer, as well as the type of equipment that had to be relied upon for such experiments - is offered by Washington Irving in the first few pages of his A History of New York, From the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty (1809): In the course of one of his lectures, the learned professor [Von Puddinghead], seizing a bucket of water swung it round his head at arms length; the impulse with which he threw the vessel from him, being a centrifugal force, the retention of his arm operating as a centripetal power, and the bucket, which was a substitute for the earth, describing a circular orbit round about the globular head and ruby visage of [the professor], which formed no bad representation of the sun. All of these particulars were duly explained to the class of gaping students around him ... An unlucky stripling, one of those vagrant geniuses . . . desirous of ascertaining the correctness of the experiment, suddenly arrested the arm of the professor, just at the moment that the bucket was in its zenith, which immediately descended with astonishing precision, upon the philosophic head of the instructor ... A hollow sound, and a red-hot hiss attended the contact, but the theory was in the amplest manner illustrated . . . whereby the students were marvellously edified, and departed considerably wiser than before.</page><page sequence="15">Science, Education, and Republican Values 535 The fledgling state of the technical curriculum matched the larger place of science in the new republic at this time. Provincial as it was, America did not yet offer any solid institutions for scientific work, academic or otherwise, whether in astronomy or agriculture. Nearly all engineers continued to be imported from abroad; similarly, the new group of science professors had nearly all been trained in Europe. No such species as the professional scientist yet existed in America. Instead, those Americans who referred to themselves as men of science were largely self-taught amateurs, men of some means who had money and leisure to adopt the privileges of independent learning. They were necessarily autodidacts, not dabblers so much as intellectual tinkerers. Many viewed science as but one among many subjects to pursue; few were exclusively de- voted to it. To most, however, science was a disci- pline for individual, intellectual, and patriotic status all at once, a required ingredient to the image of the national gentleman-scholar. Lacking a secure home, a solid organization, and a financial base, American science during this period contributed little of a fundamental, original nature. As Hindle (1956, p. 383) notes, "Strikingly, no scientific research of the time matched the im- portance of Franklin's colonial experiments in elec- tricity. Even in the realm of natural history where the Americans did become more self-reliant ... it is not clear that Western science benefited as much as American pride." Advancement of learning and pragmatic advan- tage were not often the final aim of these early men of science. Rather, they were drawn to a range of other benefits. They were interested in being worldly mod- erns, in keeping up with their times, and therefore rep- resenting the American experiment with dignity. Republican ideals, linking science to progress, were al- ways hovering in the background, but Franklin's concept of science-for-national-strength was far less important than was Jefferson's notion of "Nature's na- tion." Astronomy, geography, and natural history (in- cluding study of local plants, animals, insects, and rocks) were the favored disciplines, those that helped portray America in terms of a vast living museum wait- ing to be explored. Indeed, Jefferson's own detailed program for the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804- 1806), so successfully and famously carried out, sup- plied no small incentive for increased interest of this very type. That this epic undertaking was able to merge science, the nation, and nature in its political aspirations - in its effort to possess, through mapped and written observation, the new territory of the Louisiana Purchase (and beyond) - was not lost on the scattered community of natural historians at the time. It provided a grand exception, a massive federal underwriting of science (the very first). It be- gan a new, more rugged standard for bringing to- gether science and exploration that carried through the rest of the centuiy. It showed that a professional science might one day be possible - if, indeed, it remained true to federal priorities. For the most part, however, American science in the first generation after 1800 remained a landscape of collectors, observers, catalogers, and conversationalists, profoundly distant from the great exper- imenters and theoiy-builders of Europe. Prior to the 1820s and 1830s, when a frustrated generation of younger scholars, urged by shame and ambition, began a pilgrimage to universities and laboratories in Germany, merely a handful of Americans saw technical knowledge as a cause or mission for educational advancement at home. Again, a few outstanding exceptions existed, such as John Maclean at Princeton. Another was Benjamin Silliman, who briefly studied under Maclean before becoming Yale's first professor of chemistry in 1802 and going on to found the first professional scientific journal in the United States, The American Journal of Science (More Especially of Mineralogy, Geology, and the other Branches of Natural History; including also Agriculture and the Ornamental as well as Useful Arts), begun in 1819. Yet, like Maclean, Silliman is instructive of cir- cumstances that mitigated against what he himself came to stand for. He was not trained as a scientist, but had studied law. He wrote poetry, published po- litical and satirical essays, gave speeches on religious subjects, and read widely in the arts, philosophy, and history. When offered the appointment at Yale by President Dwight, a longtime friend, Silliman knew nothing of the subject whatsoever and, after some study on his own, journeyed to Philadelphia to seek out and attend various lectures in chemistry and medicine, which he found inadequate. In 1805-1806, he traveled to England and Scotland, "ostensibly to purchase books for the college library but actually to learn something of the subjects he was supposed to teach" (Brown, 1989, p. xiii). While there, his in- terest shifted to include geology in particular, and on his return to New Haven, he set up a series of lectures in mineralogy. While he gained consider-</page><page sequence="16">536 Montgomery able fame both as an effective teacher and as a pub- lic speaker who promoted science education on the grounds of economic progress (he himself was an early entrepreneur-consultant to the mining industry), of national independence, and of civic duty, one sees that he mostly planted the seeds for a professional scientific community that took more than 50 years to come to fruition. Indeed, only with America's full entry into the Industrial Revolution during the 1850s and 1860s, when many forms of technology became commonplace, did Silliman's dream of a home- grown scientific congregation, nourished by training at the college level, begin to appear. In the meantime, Silliman sought to make his journal an effective center of science education in the United States. His declared intention, as offered in the inaugural issue, was to produce nothing less than the Franklinian-Jeffersonian curriculum in magazine form: While Science will be cherished for its own sake, and with a due respect for its own inherent dignity; it will also be employed as the handmaid to the Arts. Its numerous applications to Agriculture.. .to our Manufactures, both mechanical and chemical; and to our Domestic Economy, will be carefully sought out and faithfully made. It is also within the design of this Journal to receive communication on Music, Sculpture, Engraving, Painting, and generally on the fine and liberal, as well as useful arts [including] Military and Civil Engineering, and the art of Navigation . . . [1819, pp. v-vi]. Silliman was highly conscious of his assumed role. "No future historian of American science will fail to commemorate this work," he wrote, "as our earliest purely scientific Journal, supported by original American communications99 (p. 3). It was a journal, therefore, to raise the level of study, publication, and learning to the level these things had achieved in Europe. At the same time, it was to be more: an embodiment of the ideal college, in which no learning of any kind was to be excluded, but where "the whole circle of physical science" formed the true core, with its infinite applicability "to human wants," its ability to "polish and benefit society", and finally, its revelation of the "supreme intelligence . . . harmony and beneficence of design in THE CREATOR." NONACADEMIC LEARNING OF SCIENCE Although certainly one truth of scientific educa- tion during the time, the mostly self-taught gentleman- scholar was by no means the only truth, or even the major one. The so-called "common school," sup- ported by local taxes, was already fairly widespread in New England, although much less so elsewhere, and gave some rudimentary instruction in geogra- phy and natural history. Nowhere was enrollment or attendance required; students went when they were not needed in the fields, stores, or at home. Most schoolhouses were small and ill-kept struc- tures, with single classes comprised of students from as young as five or six years to those in the later teens. Learning involved rote memorization and reciting by the whole class, and the purpose was rudimentary literacy. Yet the names of many natural phenomena, such as the planets, trees, flow- ers, various animals, and so forth, were also included. Above all, science was taught not as a separate area of understanding but instead invisibly, as part of the larger catalogue of titles, words, and objects that had to be implanted and that far more often than not came back to biblical maxims, e.g., the divine plan. The more important learning in the sciences, meanwhile, took place outside the academic con- text altogether. Such learning was becoming im- portant to the new middle class of prosperous farmers, store owners, merchants, and others who sought to teach and absorb science in the home, in informal or semiformal groups, clubs, and as- sociations, in struggling and often failing natural history societies that depended wholly upon fund- ing from their members. It is here, in this plurality of growing popular interest among this rising class of relatively affluent Americans, that the republi- can virtues were taken most seriously as a ration- ale for study. To some extent, the nuclear family, which had itself come of age in the second half of the 18th cen- tury, remained a dominant educative force, embod- ied in this class. Outside of the Latin schools - which charged fees and were often seen as being re- served for the wealthy few (due, in part, to the Aca- demist orientation of their curriculum) - practically all formal learning occurred at home or on the job. Sunday school was another frequent context, but one where the Bible formed the sole text and topic. In many middle-class homes, the idea of apprentice- ship was felt to be insufficient with regard to edu- cation. More elevated notions of culture, merged with the idea of raising good citizens and devout Christians, had become widespread. To varying</page><page sequence="17">Science, Education, and Republican Values 537 degrees, both mothers and fathers took on the role of teachers, the transmitters of culture and cultural interest, in the view of training the morals and rais- ing the prospects of their children. The importance of home schooling is attested to by the high rates of literacy that existed, probably in the neighbor- hood of about 70% in 1800 (when well under 50% of children attended some form of school) and over 90% by 1840, as recorded by the national census (see Graff, 1987). Again, much of what was taught and studied in science focused on astronomy and natural his- tory. These were the subjects that could be experi- enced visually and therefore were made part of the discourse and experience of the home. As such, they could be personalized in their potential for dis- covery and made immediately available to the in- terested or fascinated amateur eye. They were the subjects, in short, that could therefore teach the precepts, moral and intellectual, of a loose and use- ful philosophy merging Baconian ideas with desires to comprehend the divine plan and its lessons of patriotic advantage. In most homes of the period, a kind of do- mestic curriculum was set up. Astronomy tended to be a more male subject, taught by fathers to sons. Natural history, on the other hand, a far larger realm for potential seeing and learning, was han- dled mostly by mothers, who very often took pro- found interest in the study of plants, flowers, animals, insects, local geography and geology.11 During this period, in fact, the role of the mother regarding domestic responsibilities was greatly broadened by new views on child-rearing and family structure and also by the renewal of religious sen- timent, which posed the principal duty of wives as the raising and instructing of children. According to Cremin (1980, p. 65). "From an earlier role as aid and adjunct, she became the dominant figure of the family, creating with her strength, devotion, piety, and knowledge the ambience within which proper nurture could proceed." It is interesting to find, then, that science was very much and very often a central part of this nur- turing. That a division of subjects developed along general lines was perhaps predictable, but this divi- sion was less one of status or viewed importance nSee, for example, the essays dealing with the early 19th century in Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979, Abir-Am and Outram (1987). than of daily realities. When not required to work in the fields, the store, or elsewhere, women took domain over the home during the day and therefore tended to do any gardening work, to raise vegeta- bles, to take walks (if leisure permitted), and to therefore develop an intimate familiarity with the detailed environment in and around the house. Men who worked all day, especially in a town or urban setting, were essentially part-time inhabitants of this environment, visitors to its natural history. Women therefore tended to take charge over things more immediate and of this earth; their space of knowl- edge was the space of life, of nature's daytime ac- tivity. As such, it was also the literal and symbolic space of America itself. Fathers who were farmers also partook of this universe and taught their sons and, to some degree, their daughters about the natu- ral history of the fields and surrounding woods. Yet for the increasing number of men who were em- ployed in other ways, their science was most often that of the heavens, the night. The diurnal course of their working existence allowed them only the evenings for observation and learning. In spirit and in letter, their orbit of influence in the realm of knowledge was a more distant one. In the home curriculum, therefore, a certain balance was sought: both mothers and fathers worked to inculcate the values of careful perception and of drawing, recording, and discussing what could be learned from the natural world. These values, they believed, could be turned in their honesty and precision toward the world of men, the world of America. Science combined pragmatic and moral advantage, and through this, could help build better citizens for a better Republic. At the same time, as writers such as Kohlsted (1990) and Porter (1986) document, the learning of science within informal and semiformal groups and societies was very often connected to American values. "In the founding charters of natural history societies and learned academies, rhetoric about patriotism and presumed republican values in sci- ence and technology was commonplace" (Kohlsted, 1990, p. 427). Since the revolution, in fact, numerous small private academies had sprung up to serve the educational needs of local communities, still largely agrarian in composition and economy. Few of these high schools survived by mid-centuiy, but it seems clear that together they represent the more far-reaching effort at educational reform on the in- stitutional level during this period. Although hardly</page><page sequence="18">538 Montgomery expensive by contemporary standards, they were still out of reach for most families not of middle class or higher means (in addition to the tuition they charged, they also in effect took male children away from work in fields, stores, offices, and so forth, and thus cut down on a family's overall earning power). Yet many of them enjoyed at least a brief period of success, especially in and around the few urban ar- eas of the northern states. Within them, meanwhile, science was often taught similarly and at similar lev- els of sophistication to what was offered at that time by the colleges. At the same time, crucial differences existed as well. The emphasis on facility in Greek and Latin was less, while the emphasis on practical aspects of technical knowledge, e.g., in surveying, ag- riculture, even navigation, were far more often men- tioned. For these reasons, the colleges soon found themselves in direct competition with the academies for students. SCIENCE AND AMERICAN VALUES: A BRIEF OVERVIEW Thus, during the first quarter of the 19th cen- tury, the relevant discourse about science among the new bourgeoisie was much more specific and enthusiastic than that found within the colleges. Where academia spoke highly of science yet treated it with relative disinterest, those with edu- cation, ambition, and means seem to have thought very much in the vein of Jefferson, when they jour- neyed, that is, beyond the limits of the pious and polished gentleman. Study of science could bring about discipline and patience and a sense of both reverence and understanding toward the natural world. It could provide a means to observe and to learn from the divine plan. It taught the value of duty to a higher, communal cause and enterprise, the worth of civility and loyalty to the republic. Fi- nally, it kept one up to date, helped make one an active part of the new age and therefore a better potential citizen. Beneath this discourse, moreover, lay the still grander connection between science and pastoral- ism. Such a link should not be underemphasized; it permeated a great deal of thought and feeling about the new nation, which all knew to be filled with wilderness and the opportunities of explora- tion. The 18th century slogan of a still colonial America - "Westward the course of Empire makes its way" - had not faded by any means but had only been renewed and invigorated by the news of Lewis and Clark and other expeditions, by the rising notion of the frontier, and by the sense of a unique and virginal nature that both enclosed and helped define the prospects of the country's future. Images of the new nation as chosen by nature, gifted with a new world of natural things abounded. Painters, poets, and journalists would soon take it up, just as science had already begun to do. Study of natural history translated, at this level, into a learning and discovery of the physical body of the republic. It also went hand in hand with the feeling that nature's nation was also God's nation, that the Almighty had applied His highest creative powers in forging the landscape of the new nation and there revealing, in bold and magnificent contour, the divine plan. Indeed, as a young country, filled up with wilderness, America altogether lacked the glamor and power of European culture. What replaced these things was nature - wild, original, dynamic, sublime, and American. Guided by a Ro- mantic spirit blended with religious fervor, writers of the time veiy often opposed this American na- ture directly against a crass, material civilization, whose despoiling hands had transformed Europe into a realm of trivial garden landscapes. Yet if na- ture seemed to tug in one direction, and civilization another, these nonetheless were brought back to unity in the forests of learning and knowledge. It was science, above all, that could link such anxi- eties, that could blend the religious, the patriotic, the intellectual, even at times the sentimental, into a single content for America. Looked at more closely, it could do even more. One sees that natural history as a republican venture also comprised an exegesis of another, more specific kind. It offered a needed and responsible acquain- tanceship not only with the wonders of the surrounding environment, their unique domestic species and land- forms, but also with the traits of unprecedented na- tional character written within. The idea that an American personality lay written in the rocks, wa- ters, and organic life of the republic, as something that would always be heroically imposed upon its populace, was held by a majority of people at the time, in no small part due to the enormous reception given Samuel Stanhope Smith's Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (1787, revised 1810). Fundamentally, the</page><page sequence="19">Science, Education, and Republican Values 539 final educator for the national future was the corpus materialis of the nation itself. Pastoral advantage went this far. An excellent and representative exam- ple of the standard images invoked, not merely by journalists and painters but by scientists of the high- est caliber, is again offered by Benjamin Silliman: . . . with one glance, the eye will often survey extensive and luxuriant plains, covered with cattle, and rich in verdure; rivers flowing with a smooth and undisturbed surface, or roaring over rugged bottoms; hills crowned with orchards . . . valleys smiling with meadows and flowers . . . towns, villages and hamlets, indicative of rational life; and the immense ocean, lost at a distance beneath the incumbent sky [quoted in Brown, 1989, p. 77]. The mixture of qualities indicated in such a passage is itself as overwhelming as the landscape it seeks to describe. There is not only abundance, regularity, and rational life, but the vast play of scale and un- tamed energy as well. The power of the sublime and the beauty of the simple and bucolic are to be found everywhere in evidence, the promise of a coming na- tional ascendancy. This type of pastoral advantage was also par- ticularly visible in the reports of visiting or newly im- migrant Europeans, especially those trained in natural history or geology. Witness, for instance, the following passage, taken from the writings of the Scotsman William Maclure (his Observations on the Geology of the United States of America, 1817): The peculiar structure of the continent of North America, by the extended continuity of the immense masses of rocks of the same formation or class . . . forces the observer's attention to the limits which separate the great and principal classes; on the tracing of which, he finds so much order and regularity, that the bare collection of the facts partake somewhat of the delusion of theory. MacLure himself was to play a certain role in the history of American education through his partici- pation with Robert Owen in the New Harmony ex- periment during the 1820s (see Porter, 1986, for a detailed discussion of his career and ideas). His sci- entific inscription onto the land of such things as grandeur, symmetry, scale, the qualities of a reeling yet inspired consciousness, closely parallel the sen- timent of Silliman above. In a sense, the greatest teacher was nature itself, which went in two estab- lished directions: to God on the one hand, and to America on the other. Such ideas, which attached the learning of things scientific to higher notions of piety and patriotism, did not wane in the following decades. The belief that nature was a type of holy manuscript for American virtues of an imposing and destined type was explored and given expression, in both word and paint, for nearly the whole of the 19th cen- tury. Here, for example, is Emerson in his Journal giving his own declamatory theory to this view some 40 years after Maclure: Nature is a language and every new fact that we learn is a new word; but rightly seen, taken all together, it is not merely a language, but the language put together into a most significant and universal book. I wish to learn the language, not that I may learn a new set of nouns and verbs, but that I may read the great book which is written in that tongue. Thus, in a sense, the sciences come full circle, back to the liberal arts. Nature, in an established trope, becomes a canonical work by the greatest of all great authors, and science is thus brought within the arms of literature in the realm of America-as-myth. That the contents of this myth, of the reading that Emerson proposes, commonly yielded a message of parochial instead of universal associations was some- thing endemic to the century as a whole, something that the author often lamented in one form or an- other. Yet wherever nature went, something of sci- ence was sure to follow. Although it sometimes stood in the wooly shadows, it often walked in a glaring light as well and always through the landscape of an America growing ever more ripe with the ide- als and the things that technical knowledge would bring.
