<plain_text><page sequence="1">TCHAIKOVSKY'S MUSICAL STYLE. By Henry Zajaczkowski. Russian Music Studies, no. 19. Ann Arbor, Mich., and London: UMI Research, 1987. x, 245 pp. Photographs. $44.95, cloth. This is a technical book, aimed primarily at musicians. Its heart consists of four chapters and a summarizing epilogue that deal with technical points of Petr Il'ich Chaikovskii's art: transitional and developmental procedures, harmony, and orchestration. Henry Zajaczkowski has no pa- tience for the "musicological pantomime of derision that has passed as serious critical assess- ment" (p. vii) of Chaikovskii's music in the west. The tone throughout the book is pugnacious and polemical. The author defends Chaikovskii admirably. Critics who scold the composer for failing at tasks that, in fact, he chose not to attempt receive short shrift from Zajaczkowski. The book contains many pages of insightful musical commentary, bolstered by well chosen examples. The author's catalog of the means by which Chaikovskii effects transition is both insightful and valu- able. The discussion of the composer's orchestration, to my mind, is the most important part of the book, clarifying once and for all (through a wealth of detailed examples) why Chaikovskii must be regarded as a master of the nineteenth century orchestra. The book is flawed, however. In the two appendixes, Zajaczkowski attempts to show how Chaikovskii conceived piano music orchestrally by providing his own orchestrations, "in the 530</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 531 style of the composer," of a song and a short piano piece. The book is further marred by the author's excessive use of exaggerated metaphor, anthropomorphism, a:.d subjective "interpreta- tion" of musical events. His hermeneutics is intrusive. Consider this, from the discussion of the first movement of the Fourth Symphony: "there is a brazen intervention by the German sixth of D minor (fig. i), which drags in that 'wrong' key for the subsequent, tortured reprise of the first subject. While loud and ranting in its manner, this theme now appears utterly broken in will, as its initial reiterated tonic chords are undermined by a contradicting dominant pedal. Thoroughly beaten, it is silenced after scarcely eight measures, and meekly gives way to the recapitulated second subject" (pp. 40-41). An alternative rendering of the passage could have been the fol- lowing: Theme 1 is abridged in recapitulation to compensate for the threefold statement it re- ceives in exposition; some significant aspect of the theme's presentation in each of its three state- ments in exposition is reflected in the single statement in recapitulation. All this has the effect of permitting a single statement in recapitulation to balance all three statements in exposition and avoids the risk of permitting a good idea to overstay its welcome (particularly since so much of the development has centered on theme 1). Musical considerations of the latter kind, though they provide evidence of Chaikovskii's mastery, all too frequently do not seem to exist for Za- jaczkowski, who seems happier with thoroughly beaten themes silenced after eight measures. One wonders why the author, a serious critic aiming to rebut the "musicological pantomime of derision" in Chaikovskii scholarship, has resorted to such impressionistic modes of thought. By so doing, he invites the reader to share his daydreams, rather than pursuing his stated pur- pose: the use of detailed musical analysis to reveal the wealth of Chaikovskii's music. Small errors and questionable interpretations occur throughout the book. The so-called bitonality in Swan Lake is nothing of the sort (p. 72). And why does Zajaczkowski write: "A more genuinely organic design would have been ABC (etc.) rather than the AA'BB'CC' (etc.) pattern repre- sented here" (p. 37)? Varied repetition is no enemy of organicism, as the term is understood in nineteenth century music. In sum, Zajaczkowski provides a fine chapter on Chaikovskii's orchestration, frequent in- sights into other aspects of his musical style, and many well-chosen examples. (Nonetheless, the careful reader will need scores of many of the most important works since the author often al- ludes to passages not found in his examples.) Unfortunately, the author tends to rely excessively on impressionistic hermeneutics of a sort most often found on the backs of record jackets. Ca- veat emptor. ROBERT W.
