<plain_text><page sequence="1">HANNIBAL TRISMEGISTUS By HUBERT McNEII, POTEAT Wake Forest College Livy informs us that the events preceding and leading up to the founding of Rome are adorned with poetic fancies to the al- most complete exclusion of unimpeachable historical data. His attitude toward this very unscholarly condition is, however, in the highest degree complaisant and tolerant, for he opines that the ancients dealt largely in mythology and anthropomorphism from the praiseworthy motive of "making the first beginnings of their cities more august." He then proceeds to the characteristic re- mark that if any people on the face of the earth had a right to claim divine origin, that people was the populus Romanus. But the delicious old romancer strikes a fine pose in the same para- graph of his preface, and announces that he has no idea of at- tempting either to prove the truth or to expose the falsity of this ancient body of tales. Perhaps the well-known visitor from Mars, upon reading that statement, would conclude, with smug satisfaction, or, mayhap, disgust, that he was about to be regaled with a careful and painstaking collection of known and proven facts, well provided with cross-references, footnotes, and all the other paraphernalia so dear to the hearts of the critical and the microscopically inclined. Of course, he would be disappointed, or, mayhap, delighted, to find myth, heroic legend, preposterous tale, fact, all inextricably intermingled, and glorified by the lactea ubertas of a gorgeously colored style, a vivid imagination, and a burning love for Rome. All the editors and commentators have called attention to Livy's 1 Read at the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Southern Section of the Classi- cal Association of the Middle West and South, University of North Carolina, May 7-9, 1925. 189</page><page sequence="2">190 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL notorious carelessness in the use of such sources as were available to him. I think this carelessness was the result of a sort of in- herent indifference to absolute accuracy; and also, and more im- portant, of a genuine fondness for embroidering in his own matchless fashion hero tales whose authenticity could not possibly be established, and which would, in point of fact, lose half their glamor if they were subjected to scientific verification. Duff re- marks, "He consciously embellishes history with well-told fables." One might add, "and enjoyed the process immensely." I do not think it can be doubted that Livy picked up many of his excellent yarns from that body of legend handed down orally from genera- tion to generation, which assisted so materially in fostering the patriotism and the reverence for ancestors and for the olden time generally, so characteristic of Rome in her days of greatness and power. Now, of all Rome's enemies, dirus Hannibal was far and away the most dreadful. Pyrrhus, Mithridates, Antiochus, Arminius, cannot for a moment be compared with the terrible Carthaginian. Livy's famous character sketch of him is most likely an accurate assembling of popular notions, flavored with the added venom of the historian's own undying hatred of a mere African who for fifteen mortal years scourged Rome and her allies with barbaric and merciless thoroughness. Surely no general in all human history met and surmounted more or greater obstacles. Consider his army: composed of men speaking different languages, worshiping different gods - or no gods, trained under different codes of law - or none, outlaws, soldiers of fortune, knights of the road; any man who could wield a sword, throw a javelin, whirl a sling, or ride a horse was wel- comed. This heterogeneous mob could never have been welded into the mighty army which wrought such havoc in Italy by a general who did not possess superlative gifts of personality and a keen, unerring comprehension of the souls of men. Again, recall the fact that during his fifteen years of warfare in Italy Hannibal, with this nondescript army, thrashed, one after another, the most skilful generals and the strongest forces the Ro-</page><page sequence="3">HANNIBAL TRISMEIGISTUS 191 mans could muster against him, and finally returned to Carthage undefeated. Thirdly, his achievement of maintaining his army in the en- emy's country for such a long period of time, practically without assistance from home, is unparalleled in military annals, ancient or modern. These three matters, with others which might be mentioned to the same end, are, of course, perfectly familiar to all of you. I have rehearsed them for the purpose of supplying a background for the point which I am seeking to make in this paper, and to which I now address myself. It is my belief that there gradually grew up about the terrible figure of the Carthaginian leader a considerable crop of apocry- phal stories, which were handed down from generation to genera- tion along with the hero tales of Roman history. Any man who could do to Roman generals and Roman armies the awful things which Hannibal did must be a wizard, a magician, a warlock, in close communion with divers superhuman potencies, and, more- over, able to command them whenever he desired to do so.2 This sort of notion, it seems to me, might very naturally have crystal- lized with the passing of years which witnessed an almost unbrok- en series of Roman triumphs over other formidable foreign ene- mies. Now Livy, hating Hannibal with a vindictive bitterness surprising in the highest degree, when one considers the fact that the poor African had been in his grave a hundred and fifty years and more, and loving a good story as he did, might reasonably be expected to turn an interested and complaisant ear to these old wives' tales, which had probably lost none of their glamor and vividness with the passing of time. He has, as a matter of fact, I believe, recorded several of them for our delectation. Whether or not he himself realized their inherent improbability or impossi- bility cannot, of course, be determined, although in the case of at least two of them he professes a mild preference for a more credi- 2 It is interesting and pleasant to find Mr. Chesterton saying, in his recent book, The Everlasting Man, "Hannibal marched down the road to Rome, and the Romans who rushed to war with him felt as if they were fighting a magi- cian."</page><page sequence="4">192 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL ble explanation of the achievement under discussion. Permit me to say that I certainly do not expect all of you to agree with me in the interpretations which follow. We may differ, however, and still be friends. I beg, then, to call your attention to a series of passages ar- ranged in what appears to me climactic order. In XXI. 28 we find a lively description of the supposed methods by which Hannibal succeeded in transporting his elephants to the east bank of the Rhone: Some authorities have it that after the elephants had been herded together on the bank, the wildest of them, goaded by his keeper, pur- sued him when he leaped into the water, and the rest of the herd fol- lowed, swimming. Now, when the bottom failed them . . .the very force of the current carried them to the other side. Livy then signifies a gentle preference for the raft theory, but even at the conclusion of his discussion of it he informs us that some of the great beasts, maddened by their terror, fell off the rafts into the river, were so ponderous that they were stabiles -- which I take to mean unwashdownstreamable - and managed to reach terra firma by picking their steps with meticulous exacti- tude. Really, Livy might as well have stood by his initial effort; for if a roaring river will convey safely to its eastern shore an elephant which plunges in from the western bank, then it will surely handle likewise another elephant which falls off a raft in midstream. I may say here that the adjective "roaring" is abund- antly justified by a phrase at the beginning of the chapter - cum ingenti sono fluminis. At least one solemn editor suggests that there was a sharp bend in the stream at the point where the Carthaginians crossed, and so the current was thrown against the eastern bank. But in chapter 27 we learn that the river was so turbulent and swift that Han- nibal was constrained to tame it by sending a line of ships up- stream so that the skiffs could cross in safety below. Now that very ingenious manoeuvre (to which allusion will be made later) would never have been attempted, even by such a wonder-worker as Hannibal, at a point where the course of the stream was not straight.</page><page sequence="5">HANNIBAL TRISMEGISTUS 193 Hannibal's elephants floated across because they were Hanni- bal's elephants. An ordinary pachyderm would have been seized by the mighty Rhone and tumbled and rolled to the sea like the bodies of the Greeks and Trojans of old in the clutch of Xanthus and Simois. The second passage to which I call your attention is found in XXI. 35: On the ninth day they reached the summit of the Alps, after a deal of fruitless wandering and many mistakes caused either by the treachery of their guides or, when the suggestions of these gentry were ignored, by haphazard tramping down divers valleys at the be- hest of volunteer leaders. On the top of the ridge they camped for two days, and rest was granted the soldiers, who were worn out by toil and by battle. Now several beasts of burden, which had fallen among the rocks, by following the trail of the army came into camp. It seems a pity that Livy did not make the story complete by adding that when the poor burros arrived, they sat up on their hind legs and barked for their supper! This particular tale bears its improbability plainly in its face, as it were. Let us consider: A mountain donkey is less subject to slips and falls than any other animal that walks the earth now, or that walked it during the last years of the third century before Christ. If, then, these burros of Hannibal's commissary depart- ment fell at all, it is extremely likely that they were forced off the road at points where there was a sheer descent. Nevertheless, burdened as they were, they landed on their feet with feline skill and began presently to make their way back up the face of the cliff over which they had tumbled, found the road and, doubtless in abject terror at the prospect of the general's anger on account of their defection, stuck their noses to the ground, gave a loud and happy yelp when they caught the scent, and eventually pre- sented themselves before their chief just in time to avoid being marked A. W. O. L. A second point, please. Famous as the burro is for his stead- iness on his legs, he possesses another quality far more impres- sive, namely, his strong aversion to work of any kind. We are asked, in the passage under discussion, to accept the impossible</page><page sequence="6">194 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL conclusion that these remarkable donkeys, having slipped and fallen, having landed safely and scrambled up to the road, delib- erately, like patriotic soldiers, marched straight back to spine- breaking labor and the scanty dole of food which the commis- sary afforded them - and uphill, too. Really, it is beyond belief. What those burros did when, after a considerable tumble, they found they were still alive, was very probably to roll around on the ground until the hateful packs slipped off, and then to go whooping down toward the lower places, thanking whatever gods their assy minds could think of for freedom, and heartily wishing Hannibal and his whole army, their ancestors and their posterity, at the devil. But, please to remember, these donkeys were Hannibal's don- keys; hence, Livy is perfectly ready to accept, and to hand down to less credulous future generations, a story about them which does such violence to all the best asinine traditions. We pass now to XXII. 46. The Battle of Cannae was the most disastrous, from the point of view of casualties, in which Roman armies ever engaged. I think, therefore, that it is not unreason- able to suppose that many legends concerning it gradually took form and gained wide currency. At least two of them, in my opinion, are to be found in this chapter: It would have been easy to believe the Africans a Roman line, for they were armed with weapons picked up at the Trebia and especially at Trasimene. The Gauls and Spaniards had shields of practically the same type, but their swords were different both in size and shape; for the Gallic weapons were quite long and without points, while the Spaniards, accustomed to attack by thrusting rather than by slashing, had swords conveniently short and provided with sharp points. The appearance of these tribesmen was supremely terrifying, not only be- cause of their giant stature, but also because of the way they looked. The Gauls were naked above the waist; the Spaniards took their stand clad in tunics decorated with purple, and shimmering with a wonderful whiteness. Let us take the last point first and remark briefly that a com- pany of barbarians going into battle clad in formal morning dress, and that freshly laundered, presents a picture which sub-</page><page sequence="7">HANNIBAL TRISMEGISTUS 195 jects even the imagination to a severe strain, to say nothing of the reason. Secondly, Livy, in his evident desire to impress upon his read- ers the unusually formidable front which the enemy presented, manages to achieve a strange lack of definiteness. Habitus and species have exactly the same significance, so that the sentence in- cluding those two words should really be rendered, "The appear- ance of these tribesmen was supremely terrifying, not only be- cause of their giant stature, but also because of their appearance!" In other words, they looked simply awful by reason of the fact that they looked simply awful. Thirdly, this question inevitably arises: Why were the Gauls and Spaniards so preternaturally awe-inspiring on this particular occasion? The Romans had been acquainted with men of these races for a long time, and had, in fact, come into more frequent and intimate contact with them than with some other peoples geographically nearer. Livy's only answer to this inquiry is the dark sentence just quoted. It seems to me that the only reasonable explanation is the one already suggested. On the awful day of Cannae (so, we may imagine, went the ancient tale), some malevolent power imparted to a large section of Han- nibal's army an aspect of devilish malignancy, an appearance awe- compelling, horrific, deadly. How could Romans, depending up- on mere human resources, hope to fight successfully against such odds ? In XXII. 46.9 we learn of another supernatural potency exerted in behalf of Hannibal on the field of Cannae: Either because the lines were thus drawn up by design, or because they merely happened so to take up their respective positions, the sun fortunately shone obliquely on each army; but the wind which the natives call Volturnus, rising up against the Romans, cut off their view of the scene of action by rolling vast clouds of dust into their faces. Manifestly the cards were stacked against Varro and Paulus, the game was crooked, the gods were actively hostile. To be sure, this interposition of the elements on behalf of the Carthaginians</page><page sequence="8">196 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL is more or less evened up by the remarkable favoritism of a trick hailstorm of which Livy tells us in XXVI. 11. The terrible son of Hamilcar was at last in sight of the walls of Rome: On the next day Hannibal crossed the Anio and drew up all his forces in battle array, nor did Flaccus and the consuls decline the proffered engagement. When both armies were ready to determine the result of a contest in which the city of Rome would be the victor's prize, a terrible storm of rain and hail so confused both lines that, holding to their weapons with some difficulty, they managed to get back into camp, their fear of the enemy being the least of their ter- rors. And on the next day, when the lines had been drawn up again in the same place, the same storm [eadem tempestas] fell upon them. But when they had retreated to their tents, a remarkable serenity with tranquillity ensued. This circumstance was regarded by the Carthaginians as an unfavorable omen. Soon afterwards they returned to their base in the south. It would appear, therefore, that meteorological favors were fairly impartially distributed! Let us return now to Book XXI and consider a passage in chap- ter 27, wherein we learn of a very curious bout between the Car- thaginian leader and the river Rhone: When Hannibal learned this, [namely, that Hanno and his myrmi- dons had successfully carried out their instructions to cross farther upstream and to take up a position at the rear of the enemy's camp] that he might not be missing when the hour for action arrived, he gave the signal for crossing the river. The infantry had skiffs ready, properly equipped; the cavalry, larger boats, on account of the horses. By sending across a line of ships to break the force of the current above, he guaranteed a peaceful voyage to the skiffs [literally, "he supplied tranquillity"]. Editors and commentators differ in their explanation of the precise method whereby this particular miracle was achieved. One group holds that the line of ships referred to is the fleet in which the cavalry was accommodated - merely sent across above the skiffs in order to serve as a breakwater, while another com- pany stoutly maintains that the navium agmen was a stationary affair, somehow maintained in nice alignment above the peace- fully advancing skiffs. Both explanations are utterly incredible,</page><page sequence="9">HANNIBAL TRISMEGISTUS 197 although the second somewhat transcends its fellow. A third confraternity of editors is discreetly and suggestively silent. There are at least two bits of internal evidence which appear to show that by navium agmen the fleet which conveyed the cavalry across the stream is meant. First, the preceding sentence con- cludes with the word naves, so that its successor, beginning with navium agmen, might well be rendered, "Now this line of ships," etc. Second, if Livy had had in mind a continuous, stationary line, he would likely have used acies instead of agmen. On the other hand, there is in the passage a startling inconsistency which points to the second theory. In section 9 we read: "The infan- try had skiffs ready, properly equipped; the cavalry, larger boats [fere naves] on account of the horses." But in section 10, three lines below, we learn that most of the horses were pulled along through the water by bridles. Let us examine both theories, briefly. The Carthaginians crossed the Rhone about forty miles inland, where the river is deep and very swift. Ancient ships - even the best of them - were of slight draught, and Hannibal's made- to-order navy must have been bird-like in the extreme. The ships bearing the cavalry - according to the former theory - must have traveled more rapidly than the laboring skiffs; but, in order to derive the slightest benefit from the retarded current, each skiff would have been compelled to move immediately under the lee of its protecting ship, which position would have been not only perilous in the highest degree to the men and beasts on both vessels, but could not possibly have been maintained all the way across the river because of the discrepancy in the speed of the respective craft. The second theory is even more hopeless. We are asked by the editors who sponsor it to believe that a stationary line of frail cockle-shells was, by some superhuman means, held beam on across the mighty bosom of the river, which obligingly backed up so completely that below the tiny barrier there was tranquillitas. In XXI. 47 Livy tells us that Coelius is authority for the state- ment that Mago with the cavalry and the Spaniards swam the Po,</page><page sequence="10">198 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL while Hannibal with the main body of the army crossed the stream farther up, where the water was shallow, after planting a row of elephants in line ad sustinendum impetum fluminis. One dear old editor comments thus: "The elephants were so placed that the violence of the current was broken on their colossal bodies." But Livy doesn't believe the story, for he continues: Those who are acquainted with the river can scarcely credit this narrative, for it is very unlikely that the cavalry could have con- tended successfully against the current without the loss of their weapons and their horses, even if we grant that all the Spaniards sailed over on inflated wine-skins; furthermore, a journey of many days would have been necessary to reach the shallows of the Po, where an army laden with baggage could have been transported. Those authorities have more weight with me who insist that within two days a place was found with some difficulty where the troops could be sent across on rafts. Now, if Livy found himself unable to believe that elephants could check the feeble strength of the Po in its upper reaches, it is difficult to see how he could solemnly have handed down to pos- terity so impossible a picture as the second interpretation of the passage in question suggests. One further consideration: Even if we accept the impossible possibility of the establishment of a nicely aligned row of ships, beam on and yet graciously refraining from smashing one another to pieces, we must allow that Hannibal possessed enough common sense to know that when a dam is constructed the place to look for tranquillity is not below the dam, but above it. One wonders why Livy wasted so much energy in describing a mighty struggle with a river which took elephants gently to its bosom and conveyed them carefully across to its eastern bank without any particular effort on their part. Surely this most com- plaisant stream would have taken just as good care of the rest of Hannibal's army as it did of the tanks, if it had been given half a chance, and the Carthaginians would have been spared a vast amount of labor, time, and trouble. In short, neither interpreta- tion of the passage succeeds in the smallest degree in explaining this inexplicable and very characteristic Livian story.</page><page sequence="11">HANNIBAL TRISMEGISTUS 199 Finally - and all of you, I am sure, have been wondering how soon this episode would be introduced - there is the marvelous road-building performance on the summit of the Alps. I quote from XXI. 37: At last, when men and beasts had been worn out to no purpose, camp was made on the summit, after a place had been cleared with great difficulty, on account of the vast quantity of snow which had to be dug up and carried away. Then soldiers were detailed to make passable the cliff over which was the only possible descent; and, since the rock had to be cut, they felled and split up numerous large trees,3 made a great heap of logs, and when a wind strong enough to fan the flames had arisen, they kindled the pile and softened the hot rocks by pouring acid over them. Finally, with iron implements they shattered the fire-heated cliff and softened the precipice by means of gentle windings, so that not only the beasts of burden, but even the ele- phants could descend. Editors generally have realized the utter impossibility of this yarn, considered from any one of several points of view, although there is a contemporary commentator in whose edition we read: "This method of rendering rocks friable was not uncommon among the ancients . . . and dashing water upon heated rocks has been used for this purpose also in modern times. The amount of acetum (posca, or sour wine) need not have been large, when added to the water from the melting snow, for disintegrat- ing ardentia saxa, especially if they were limestone. . . On the whole it may be concluded that Livy's account, though it is not impossible, is not very probable." 4 To my mind, the fact that so important an achievement as the construction of this road is not mentioned by Polybius is con- clusive proof that the whole story is pure myth. It may be furth- er noted that, as one editor points out, not only is Polybius "silent on the subject," but "he complains (III. 47, 48) that many false- hoods were current in regard to the passage of the Alps." Livy himself is difficult and inconsistent in his description of the 3 One editor renders deiectis detruncatisque by "cut down and cut up." 4The Classical Weekly, XVI, 10 and XVIII, 11 may also be read with profit in this connection.</page><page sequence="12">200 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL achievement. In XXI. 36.1 we learn that when the army arrived at the cliff a light-armed soldier let himself down over the face of the precipice with great difficulty by clinging to shrubs and roots. Some fifteen lines farther down, in section 7, Livy informs us that along the detour attempted by Hannibal there were no shrubs or roots to which one might cling. It may possibly be objected that the top of the mountain and the detour were two different places. I reply by quoting section 4: "There seemed no doubt that he must lead his army around through pathless and hitherto untrodden ways, no matter how long the circuit. But this road was impassable." Well, if it was impassable, the dis- tance the army traveled over it must have been negligible, and the two places were virtually one. Again in 37.2 we read about the felling and splitting up of great trees. But seven lines away, in section 4, the statement is made that the summits were practically bare! Editors differ in their translation of aceto. Some think it signifies vinegar; others, sour wine or vinegar-water (posca), such as the soldiers drank. One of the most interesting of the voyages of Lemuel Gulliver was the trip to Laputa. On the way home he visited Glubbdubdrib, which, as he says, "signifies the island of sorcerers or magicians." He proceeds: "His High- ness the governor ordered me 'to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the present time, and com- mand them to answer any questions I should think fit to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within the compass of the times they lived in. And one thing I might de- pend upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent of no use in the lower world.' " Gulliver then describes how he called up Alexander the Great, who assured him "upon his honor 'that he was not poisoned, but died of a bad fever, by excessive drinking'. Next," continues the doughty traveller, "I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me 'he had not a drop of vinegar in his camp.' " Old Gul- liver, splendide mendax though he is, may at this point, I believe,</page><page sequence="13">HANNIBAL TRISMIEGISTUS 201 be implicitly trusted. It is utterly impossible to conceive of a general lugging vinegar, or even sour wine, for that matter, in sufficient quantities to accomplish the miracle described so graphi- cally and yet so inconsistently by our author. One further and even more important point. Livy says, in 36.2, "The place, already steep, had been broken off short by a recent avalanche to a depth of fully a thousand feet." In other words, one thousand feet of road had been swept away. Now, even if a great fire had been kindled upon the upper edge of this precipice, its heat could not possibly have penetrated the cliff to any considerable distance. We are asked, in fine, to believe that the burning of a huge heap of logs at the top of a sheer cliff, and the pouring of vinegar or sour wine on the heated stone, made the whole cliff friable, so that the soldiers, with their spears or other iron implements, were able to cut and chip out a gently winding piece of road a thousand feet long, over which men, beasts - and Hannibal - passed in relative comfort. The story, as a story, is surely one of Livy's best; and like the others mentioned in this paper, it clearly proves, I believe, that the great Carthaginian was, in legend and popular imagination, really and truly Hannibal Trismegistus.</page></plain_text>
