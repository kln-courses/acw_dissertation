<plain_text><page sequence="1">22 WRETCHED TALES OF POETS: EURIPIDES, HERACLES 1340-6 Like everything else that Mr. T.C.W. Stinton writes, his recent article 4 "Si credere dignum est": some expressions of disbelief in Euripides and others'1 displays a range of learning and a subtlety of argument with which few of us could attempt to compete. If I now take issue with his interpretation of one particular passage, I am certainly not doing so in any spirit of rivalry or depreciation of his achievements. I am, however, emboldened to write this article by his frank admission, concerning his account of HF 1340-6, 4I am not sure that I now believe it myself (p. 89, n. 56). Where Stinton is in doubt about his own interpretation, it may not be presumptuous for a lesser mortal to advocate another. The passage runs: Hp. oipoi- rcápepya &lt;pèv&gt; xá8' šať èpéov k&lt;xkg)v, èycò 8è xoùç Geoòç ofrcs XéKxp' &amp; 'iý' Gépiç axépyeiv vopisco, Ssopá x' èÇárcxeiv xEP°w o(5x' ifëicoaa rctímox' ouxe rcsíaopai, oò8' áXXov áXXov 8eo7tóxr|v rceípoicávai. 8eíxai yàp ó Geóç, eircep £ax' ôpGôç Geóç, oò8evóç* àoi8cov o'í8e 8i3axrļvoi Xóyoi. The problem is a notorious one. Heracles' idealistic account of the gods appears quite incompatible not only with the events of the play but with his own interpretation of those events, since at 1303ff. he has bitterly attributed his downfall to the malicious jealousy of Hera, which derives from the adultery of Zeus with Alcmene (and he will blame Hera once again at 1392f.). Stinton's explanation is that Heracles' apparent expression of disbelief is really an expression of moral disapproval of facts which he knows all too well to be true. The passage is comparable with the sentence T can't believe that a Parliament House will be built in Swansea', which may merely express 4some disapproval of the policy of devolution, or a mild wonder at its consequences'. We might well wish to believe this account, since, as Stinton observes, disapproval of the gods of Greek legend, rather than disbelief in them, is the attitude to which many of Euripides' plays, including the Heracles, appear logically to point. But is the account in fact credible? Heracles expresses not merely disbelief in certain legends but a positive religious doctrine, one which had been current in Greece since the time of Xenophanes and which many thoughtful Athenians of Euripides' own day must have found attractive. Simply to say that one does not believe a story is one thing; to justify that disbelief with an alternative account of the</page><page sequence="2">WRETCHED TALES OF POETS: EURIPIDES, HERACLES 1340-6 23 facts (Seixal yàp ó Oeóç, eXrcep šať òpGtòç 0eóç, oòSsvóç), and to explain how the false story came about (àoiSœv o'íSe 8úoxr|voi Xóyoi), is quite another. It is as though Mr. Stinton were to remark 'I can't believe that a Parliament House will be built in Swansea, for the Welsh are an inferior race incapable of self-government; these are lies put out by scheming politicians'. That, I think, would leave us in no doubt at all that his disbelief in the proposed Parliament House was genuine; and similarly I do not see how it could have occurred to Euripides' audience to doubt that Heracles' emphatic and considered account of divine harmony and self- sufficiency meant exactly what it said. This is all the more true since, as Stinton himself points out, the idea that we are dependent for our knowledge of the gods on poets' stories, which might possibly be false, has already been planted by Theseus at 1315, in the passage to which Heracles is explicitly replying. Stinton's account of 1340-6 would hardly, I think, have appeared plausible at all if it had been presented in isolation. It gains whatever plausibility it possesses from being presented at the end of an article discussing numerous expressions of disbelief, each harder to explain away than the last. And few will deny, I am sure, that most of what Stinton has to say in this article is excellent and right. At the end of the present article, however, I shall attempt to show that none of his other discussions affords a genuine parallel for his explanation of the Heracles passage. Before giving my own explanation, it may be as well to discuss briefly the opinion of several recent scholars that, even if the passage is taken literally, there is no real contradiction of what is said elsewhere. From the various accounts two main arguments can be extracted. Firstly, Grube2 and others claim that Heracles' words are not incompatible with Zeus's adultery with Alcmene, because Heracles is concerned only to answer what Theseus said at 1314ff., and Theseus mentioned only the gods' adulteries with each other. Secondly, Burnett and Rivier3 claim that Heracles' words are not incompatible with his persecution by Hera, because he does not deny that the gods cause undeserved suffering to mortals. They would indeed be incompatible with the ascription of jealousy to Hera, but, it is argued, the only place in the play where the motive of jealousy is mentioned is in Heracles' words at 1308ff., and Heracles is at that point buried in a despair from which he has recovered by 1340. So, although he still blames Hera for his downfall at the end of this speech (1392f.), he may now believe that she was directed by some inscrutable motive other than jealousy. These arguments seem to me more ingenious than persuasive. As to the first of them, Heracles objects to Theseus' account of the gods on moral grounds, and it is hard (pace Grube) to see any moral distinction between a god's adultery with a goddess and his adultery with a mortal woman. Certainly Zeus's relations with Alcmene are described in terms of strong condemnation by Amphitryon at 344f. If Euripides wished Heracles to draw such a curious moral distinction, objecting only to the gods' adulteries with each other, he should surely have made this explicit. The words actually used, which deny that the gods indulge in any illicit unions, will be bound to mislead.</page><page sequence="3">24 A. L. BROWN As to the second argument, I find it extremely difficult to separate the fact of Hera's persecution of Heracles from the motive of jealousy. The audience knows of no other possible motive for the persecution; it will assume throughout the play ( pace Burnett) that Hera is impelled by jealousy, and will find confirmation of that assumption at 1308ff.; it would be surprised to learn of a new motive at the end of the play, and in fact no new motive is even hinted at. Persecution by Hera must imply jealousy in default of an explicit alternative explanation. Nor are we given any encouragement to think that Heracles could plausibly have abandoned his belief in Hera's jealousy by 1340. The only change in him is that he is now resolved to live and not to die, for reasons which he carefully explains; his mood in general remains the same as before, and his attitude to Hera at 1392f. sounds just as bitter as ever. And obviously nothing that he has heard from Theseus could have changed his opinion on this point. It seems to me, then, that, as Lesky has firmly insisted,4 the contradictions are there and are not to be resolved. Now it is admittedly true that at 1340-6 Heracles does not actually have his own experience of the gods in mind. He is replying to generalisations by Theseus, the purpose of which is to point to divine ápapríai as a parallel to human ápapxíai; the gods endure the shame of such things, so men should do the same. Incongruously enough for men of the Heroic Age, both Theseus and Heracles talk as though they, like men of Euripides' day, were dependent on the poets' tales for knowledge of the gods' behaviour. But the relevance of the lines to Heracles' own case can hardly have gone unnoticed by Euripides, who is himself dramatising an àoiSfòv Xóyoç, even if we are to suppose that it is unnoticed by Heracles; and we may indeed suspect that this relevance to Heracles' own case is the real reason why Euripides introduces the subject in the first place. I say this because the examples given by Theseus, which provoke Heracles' disbelief, are not really very appropriate to his own argument. The shame of Heracles' crimes lies in the fact that they were involuntary crimes against his (pitan, whom he should have protected. The examples given by Theseus are of wilful and deliberate crimes among the gods, not directed against cpltan and not forced upon them by any higher power, and crimes of this sort cannot entail shame in anything like the same sense. Indeed, Theseus would have done much better to cite examples of divine suffering , which are what we expect after 1314f. The whole subject of crimes among the gods thus seems to have been thrust in by the dramatist for an ulterior motive, despite its limited relevance to the immediate argument. Certainly it does nothing to advance the action of this part of the play. This helps to confirm, I think, that we shall be right to fall back, with whatever reluctance, on the opinion of Wilamowitz and many others that Euripides has inserted lines 1340-6 without regard for their consistency or suitability in the mouth of Heracles simply because they represent a cherished belief of his own which he is concerned to express at this point in the play. I am aware that this explanation does Euripides less credit than Stinton's; but I feel that we are here dealing with such a</page><page sequence="4">WRETCHED TALES OF POETS: EURIPIDES, HERACLES 1340-6 25 puzzling phenomenon that our task must be not to save Euripides' face but simply to explain how the phenomenon could possibly have occurred - with the proviso that, although Euripides was no doubt a remarkably uneven writer, an explanation which makes him appear an imbecile or a complete incompetent will be no explanation at all, since we have clear evidence elsewhere that he was neither. I am aware also that to explain passages of Greek tragedy in extra-dramatic terms is unfashionable, and in general rightly so; explanations of this type have been characteristic of romantic criticism, and they have usually been wrong. But no one can show that they invariably must be wrong; and this is one case where, as far as I can see, we can do no better. But if the lines represent Euripides' personal opinion, how could he wish to contradict his own play? Must we now accept Verrall's view that the whole play is intended ironically, as a satirical debunking of the myth? I shall argue that this does not follow; that the Heracles could have been written, and seriously intended, by a man who, as a matter of personal belief, held the views stated at 1340-6; and that it was precisely because this might appear paradoxical - because it might easily be thought that the author of such a play could not be a believer in ideal divinities - that the lines were inserted.5 Every drama is dependent on its premises. Its job is not to tell us whether the premises are true, but to explore what would follow if they were - o'a ftv yévoixo Kai xà Suvaxà Kaxà xò eíkòç fļ xò àvayKaïov. If the events of the drama genuinely follow from the premises according to some kind of logic (which may not be the kind that Aristotle had in mind in Poetics 9), then the drama will be valid whether or not the premises are true. At a simple level every audience or reader of fiction accepts this instinctively; we allow a writer to invent characters who never lived and events that never happened, or to accept legends in which he does not literally believe, because we realise that the content of his work - the truth to which he is committing himself - lies not in these premises but in what is made to follow from them. Among the premises of a drama must be counted, as a rule, any supernatural apparatus employed. ' Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches' does not tell us anything about the existence or nature or witches, but merely that the dramatist has chosen to use witches in his play. Since audiences generally realise this, dramatists do not feel obliged to portray only those supernatural beings in which they happen to believe. If, however, the witches then behave in a way that conforms, say, to our notion of the nature of evil, and if men react to them in a way that conforms to our notion of human nature, we shall find in the play such validity and 'truth' as a play can possess. It is hardly less elementary to point out (as Stinton, in fact, does in his article) that Euripides is not committed to belief in the gods as he portrays them. If the goddess Aphrodite behaved a? the myth of Hippolytus tells us she did, then the action of Euripides' Hippolytus could plausibly occur. In the course of that action Euripides</page><page sequence="5">26 A. L. BROWN goes out of his way to show that her behaviour is contemptibly spiteful and vindictive. But the play does not and cannot tell us that Aphrodite really behaves in this way; it can only tell us what would follow if she did. If this were not so, indeed, then modern readers, who are unlikely to believe literally in Aphrodite, would presumably have little use for the play. The Hippolytus could, then, have been written by a man who personally believed that God was single and perfect. The fact that Seneca and Racine wrote plays on the same theme is further proof of that. What is true of the Hippolytus must be true, in principle, of the Heracles. Evidently Euripides is not committed to a literal belief in Iris and Lyssa, who are little more than stage machinery; but it should follow that he is equally uncommitted to a literal belief in that Hera who sent Iris and Lyssa, and in that Zeus who wronged Hera in the first place. We may note, however, two important differences between Hippolytus and Heracles. Firstly, the gods of Hippolytus are less essential to the main action of the play. Apart from the coming of Poseidon's bull, all that happens between Aphrodite's exit and Artemis's entrance would be explicable, and plausible, in purely human terms. We cannot deny that the action of the play might, in its essentials, really happen; Aphrodite and Artemis merely overdetermine it, and if we do not believe in them literally we are free to think of them in terms of symbolism. In the Heracles , on the other hand, the gods intervene so directly and arbitrarily that overdetermination and symbolism can hardly be in question. The madness of Heracles does bear some resemblance to madness in real life, but most critics now agree that nothing in Heracles' character foreshadows it and makes it psychologically convincing; it does not compel our belief to nearly the same extent as the passion of Phaedra. The gods who cause it, then, are little more than the personal anthropomorphic gods of myth, and any spectator who found himself morally revolted by their treatment of Heracles might well deny that the action of the play was a plausible action at all. Secondly, Aphrodite and Artemis are more or less free agents in the Hippolytus, their conduct tells us nothing about that of any other god, and does not preclude the possibility that the gods of true religious belief are higher, more perfect beings than they. Aphrodite never was good raw material for a moral divinity; any Greek who demanded justice and morality from his gods would be likely, not to moralise Aphrodite, but to deny that she existed at all and to attribute sexual passion to other causes. In the Heracles , on the other hand, we are concerned with the behaviour of Zeus himself, and the Greeks certainly did moralise Zeus. Zeus was by definition the supreme god, and if there was to be a divine principle of justice and perfection at all, Zeus must be its name. For these reasons the Heracles , which directs our attention unavoidably to the issue of divine justice, can more easily seem a deliberately blasphemous and irreligious play than the Hippolytus , or indeed any other play of Euripides. The play cannot, strictly speaking, tell us that no well-behaved and self-sufficient god exists;</page><page sequence="6">WRETCHED TALES OF POETS: EURIPIDES, HERACLES 1340-6 27 but the existence of such a god is directly and obviously incompatible with premises which are fundamental to the action. The play itself does not show those premises to be false, as Verrall thought, any more than it shows them to be true; no tragedy can legitimately do either. What it represents is Euripides' serious and considered reaction to those premises; his concern is, as always, to enact the myth as plausibly as possible according to his own conception of plausibility. But an audience might well be guilty of what Aristotle calls paralogism6 - of believing that the premises were true, or that Euripides thought them true, because the conclusions followed convincingly from them. Euripides, if he happened to believe in a god like that of Xenophanes, could easily have wished to avert this danger; and I do not find it incredible - though it may be discreditable - that he should have done so, at the cost of dramatic consistency, by means of an explicit statement of his own beliefs placed in the mouth of his main character. If my account is correct, it is no coincidence that the lines which express the loftiest conception of divinity in all of Euripides occur in the play whose action does least to justify them. The famous line from the Bellerophon, ei Geo! xi Spöaiv aiaxpóv, oďk eiďiv Geo! (fr. 292), is compatible with either of two possible beliefs: either the gods do commit base actions and do not deserve the name of gods, or they are just and do deserve that name. From Xenophanes to Plato, and far beyond, those Greeks who were concerned about the morality of the gods normally accepted the second of these beliefs, and, if they found the myths incompatible with it, amended or rejected the myths. It is attractive, no doubt, to think of Euripides as a lone champion of the opposite view, that the gods do indeed perform base actions and that the myths are to that extent true to life. And I think it is legitimate to see in this a 'message' of many of his plays, which do at least present the myths convincingly and insist that the gods' actions in them cannot be excused. But the 'message' of a play need not be identical with the personal belief of the dramatist (which is something we generally cannot know and do not need to know); and it was perhaps never very likely that Euripides' personal beliefs should have so far differed from those of other fifth- century intellectuals that he actually considered the gods immoral. And we have, I think, other evidence besides our passage of the Heracles that he did not. His plays, after all, contain numerous self-conscious expressions of religious faith, which the action often does nothing to refute. Even if no one of these expressions need represent Euripides' own view, they collectively present a difficulty for anyone who believes that Euripides consciously thought of the gods as immoral and wished to depict them as such.7 Particularly interesting in this context is IT 380-391, a passage which has often been compared with HF 1340-6. Iphigeneia begins (380-4) by blaming the equivocations of Artemis, who bans polluted men from her altars while herself taking pleasure in human sacrifice. But she continues (385-391) by saying that Leto, wife of Zeus, cannot have given birth to such ignorance; she (Iphigeneia) does not believe that the gods consumed the flesh of Pelops, and similarly in the present case</page><page sequence="7">28 A. L. BROWN the Taurians have merely projected their own depravity onto Artemis; 'for I do not think that any of the gods is evil'. Stinton, who does not in fact discuss this passage, might be expected to argue that the expression of condemnation (380-4) should be taken literally, and that the ensuing expression of disbelief (385-391) is designed merely to reinforce this. If he did, I would not easily be persuaded; for the arguments applied above to his account of the Heracles passage could be applied again here, and it would take an exceptionally subtle audience to guess, when an episode ended on such a resounding note of edifying sententiousness, that what was meant was different from what was said. (Rejection of barbaric Taurian beliefs would in any case hardly have seemed unconventional to a Greek audience.) It is thus much easier to suppose that Iphigeneia first accepts the Taurian belief simply for the sake of argument, and then, because she has shown that it makes Artemis immoral and irrational, concludes that it is false.8 For Iphigeneia, then, the morality of the gods is axiomatic, and any doctrine in which they appear immoral must therefore be rejected; and, since there is surely more going on here than characterisation of Iphigeneia, we may be fairly sure that this reasoning appealed to Euripides himself. I am suggesting, then, that we should attribute to Euripides both a personal belief in the kind of god described at HF 1340-6 and a desire to dramatise faithfully and honestly myths in which the gods are clearly very different. This will perhaps make it easier to understand such difficult plays as the Ion , whose peculiar blend of piety and cynicism baffles so many readers. It is true that Euripides is presented by Aristophanes as an atheist, but this need only mean, what is certainly the case, that he did not share the naive and unquestioning faith of the average peasant. And Aristophanes' evidence also shows that men were no less ready in the fifth century than in subsequent ages to quote any gnomic utterance out of context on the assumption that it must represent the author's personal opinion - a fact worth bearing in mind when we consider what HF 1 340-6, or any other expression of faith, would have meant to a fifth-century audience. If, finally, we ask why Euripides should have chosen to dramatise such morally difficult stories, a partial answer will be that they at least allowed him to present his own vision of the uncertainties and futilities of human life; a more complete answer would perhaps lie deep within a complex personality, where we cannot search for it. And if we ask whether such a sombre view of human life could be compatible with an idealistic view of the gods, a simple answer will be that it is not difficult to find people who manage to combine such views today. I must now return, as I promised, to the article of Stinton's with which I began, for if I am to reject one part of that article I must give some account of my attitude to the rest. If Stinton genuinely provides similar solutions to similar problems, we shall be reluctant to accept some of these solutions and reject others; but if either the solutions or the problems in fact differ materially from each other, we shall be free to pick and choose, accepting only those solutions which seem plausible in themselves.</page><page sequence="8">WRETCHED TALES OF POETS: EURIPIDES, HERACLES 1340-6 29 It will be admitted, I think, that the various expressions of disbelief from assorted prose and verse writers which occupy the first half of Stinton's article are a fairly disparate collection, and that most of them differ from the Heracles passage in being very brief and unargued,9 so that what we may call the Parliament-in- Swansea principle can much more easily be applied to them. In the second half of the article Stinton discusses some passages of Euripides in more detail. The first is Hel 'ě 17-22, where Helen gives a distinctly sceptical account of how Zeus begot her in the form of a swan, a story which is treated elsewhere in the play as being true. The Xóaiç is to show that Helen is likely to be expressing incredulity at the fact of her divine birth, rather than simply at the peculiar circumstances of it, and that in the distressing situation in which she now finds herself this incredulity is appropriate and dramatically effective. I find this wholly convincing; but it is quite unlike Stinton's explanation of the Heracles passage, where it would clearly be impossible to show that incredulity at the legends in question is appropriate to the situation, and where Stinton has to argue that a different attitude, one of moral disapproval, is in fact meant. I A 793-800, again expressing doubt about the story of Leda and the Swan, bears some resemblance to the Heracles passage, in that false tales of poets are mentioned as a possible explanation of the legend's existence. But Stinton argues that doubt about Helen's divine birth is appropriate to the mood of hopelessness which the ode as a whole conveys; and if this is so, then this passage too affords no parallel for Stinton's explanation of HF 1340-6, any more than for mine. El 737-746 is an extremely difficult passage, and Stinton goes a long way towards resolving the difficulties when he suggests that the words xàv Sé rcíaxiv apiKpàv rcap' £povy' 1%ei express condemnation of divine inequity in changing the sun's course for the sake of a single mortal, rather than disbelief in an astronomically implausible legend. Here, then, Stinton does invoke the Parliament-in-Swansea principle, as with the Heracles passage; but here the explanation is made credible by the fact that the expresión of ostensible disbelief is limited to a single brief phrase, which is not justified by any argument, and which, as Stinton notes, is closely parallel in form to several Herodotean expressions discussed at the beginning of his article. Further, even if the words xàv 8è rcíaxiv apiicpàv nap' £poiy' £xei really express disapproval on the part of the chorus , who are committed to the truth of the story which they are in the middle of telling, they may still hint at actual disbelief on the part of Euripides , who is not so committed. If the chorus find the story morally objectionable, presumably Euripides must do so; and I have argued above that if Euripides found a story about the gods morally objectionable he would be likely to reject it. Perhaps I may take this opportunity of making a further point about the Electra passage, although this will lead me away from my main argument. It follows from Stinton's analysis that the actual expression of disbelief, xàv ... £xEl&gt; is parenthetical and incidental to the sentence in which it occurs: 'It is said (incredible though it</page><page sequence="9">30 A. L. BROWN seems) that the sun changed its course for the sake of a mortal suit'. That being so, it is not clear to me why Stinton regards 8è in (poßepot 8è ßpoxotai pööoi KépSoç rcpòç Gséov 06 panei av as adversative, answering to the parenthetical expression of disbelief, so that the words have to imply 'frightening tales are useful for religion even if they are false ' It would surely be easier to make 8é continuative, carrying on from the main point of the previous sentence, the issue of truth or falsity being by now forgotten. This will make it easier to accept Stinton's contention that the tone need not be cynical; and, by removing the implication that the pööoi are false, it will remove the need to make Gecov rather than põGoi the antecedent of d&gt;v in 745. That is a very desirable result, since if Gecov were the antecedent, as Stinton believes, the link between the final sentence and the rest of the stanza would be very weak and artificial - in effect 'frightening tales are useful for the service of the gods; and, talking of gods, you did not remember them ...'.

Greenwood, Aspects ofEuripidean tragedy (Cambridge, 1953) 59ff., and D.J. Conacher, Euripidean drama (Toronto, 1967) 78ff. But I would not myself describe the plot of the Heracles as fantasy (Greenwood) or as a reductio ad absurdum of the myth (Conacher). Within the conventions of Greek tragedy there is nothing fantastic or absurd about it. 6. Poet. 1460 a 20ff. 7. It is true that one can also find expressions condemning the gods, a few of which go beyond the requirements of the dramatic context; an example is HF 655ff., which Stinton quotes (p. 81). But these seem easier to explain away. I should guess that Euripides in fact believed the gods (or god) to be more or less unconcerned with human affairs; but if we want to say that the world is badly ordered in some way, a striking and effective way of doing so is to accept for the moment the traditional belief that divine beings have ordered it, and to complain that they have done a bad job (why can't the Almighty provide better weather on Sundays?). 8. Admittedly this is not quite consistent with 35-41, where Iphigeneia disapprovingly accepts that Artemis takes pleasure in the sacrifices; but this merely means that she has not yet reached the conclusion that she reaches at 385ff. (Euripides has clearly been placed in some difficulty by the requirement of the plot that a virtuous Greek maiden should deign to be a party to these barbaric rites.) And by the end of the play it is fairly clear that Artemis does not in fact condone human sacrifice among the Taurians any more than at Aulis. 9. Exceptions to this are the passages from Pindar, Callimachus, and Euripides' Troades (pp. 67-7 1 ). But it would not be difficult to show that these passages, like those on Leda and the Swan which I discuss in the text, are in fact explained by Stinton in terms which could not be applied to the Heracles passage.</page></plain_text>
