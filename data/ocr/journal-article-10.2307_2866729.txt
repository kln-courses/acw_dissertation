<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR By GEORGE W. WILLIAMS Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude. -As You Like It HE LINES opening the second scene of Act Three of King Lear, com- prising the king's remarks on the storm, often quoted and admired, and admittedly some of the most important in the play, have never been examined in detail. They are, however, climactic in the play and fundamental to the character of the king, and they exhibit that combination of dramatic and poetic genius which one expects to find in Shakespeare in critical passages. They are, in short, "the very heart of the organism."' The late Harley Granville- Barker has pointed out the fusion of the storm in nature and the storm in the protagonist: Lear-striving (we are given the hint) "... in his little world of man to out- scorn the to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain," matching himself against the storm, echoing it in defying it-becomes for us, without ceasing to be himself, a very image of it. He creates it dramatically; but not by detached description, which would merely let us see it through his eyes. He is endued, and he endues us, with the very spirit of it. He, for the crucial moment, is at one with it, and we with him, and he is to us Lear and the storm too.2 This dramatic presentation of the storm without identified and equated with the storm within and, it may be added, with the disruption in the kingdom, requires writing of the highest intensity. The first speech in the second scene is Lear's (III. ii. i-9). It is the crowning speech of the first part of the play-in a sense the keystone. Only a few lines later, Lear says, "My wits begin to turn." His speeches in scene ii show the last traces of his already vanishing sanity, and in scene iv he is "far gone, far gone." His prayer in scene iv (28-36) concluding: Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just is the first step in the regenerative process, showing as it does a sympathy to- wards man and an incipient willingness to admit an error, but it is also the last sane utterance, if not indeed an expression of a mentality already deranged, and it follows the height of the storm. 1 G.

Contending with the fretful elements; Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main, That things might change or cease; tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of; Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain. This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all. (I-I5) Kent. Fie on this storm! (49) This descriptive speech is extremely important to the great storm speech of the following scene, for it suggests in advance the wildness of the night (not real- ized fully until it appears in Lear), it anticipates the themes he is to develop (the violence of the wind and water, destruction and annihilation), and it em- phasizes significantly the unnaturalness of nature. The animal imagery is here, as typically in Lear, very revealing: the implication is clear that the animals men- tioned in this passage-wild, ravening, and scavenging at best and here urged by abnormal causes to a state beyond their characteristic wildness-are reacting more reasonably to the storm than is the king. Edgar's lines, "False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey" (III. iv. 95-97), may serve as a useful gloss to these allusions. Thus the lion is not the royal figure (is without the majesty and cere- mony of kingship) so much as he is the beast of prey; the wolf, by nature greedy, is belly-pinched, almost starving; and the bear dam, having nursed her cubs-who like Lear's daughters have taken all from her and yet clamor for more-hungers to feed herself and them. An association is evidently intended. These wild animals in spite of their roughness are, after all, out of the weather under cover from the storm in the same way that Lear's daughters have found shelter from its violence, closing their doors to him as they went.3 Lear himself 3 Cf.

I8; Knight, p. 195.</page><page sequence="3">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR 59 points the significance of these references to wild animality in his earlier lines: No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose To wage against the enmity o' th' air, To be a comrade with the wolf and owl- Necessity's sharp pinch! (II. iv. 2II-214) The wolf, symbol of greed, and the owl, of malevolence, are the evil companions the king expects to meet on the heath. Actually even the most irrational animals have left the barren heath to seek protection, while the king, unbonneted, and abandoned by every creature, stands alone against animal nature, human nature, and, as he discovers, cosmic nature, attended only by the pricking wisdom of the Fool.4 The unnaturalness and wildness of nature are further indicated in the very winds and seas themselves, which are urged to reverse the order of things pre- scribed in the creation of the world: "God said againe, Let the waters under the heauen bee gathered into one place, and let the drie land appeare: and it was so."5 But the reversion and madness of the elements are equated with the chaotic condition of the king at odds with himself and are described in terms of human physiology to heighten the identification. The impetuous blasts are in a state of eyeless rage just as Lear is in high rage;' the image of sight instantly recalls the frequent references to Lear's spiritual blindness and to Gloucester's physical blindness.7 The correspondence between Lear and the world, the microcosm and the macrocosm, is indicated in the line "striving in his little world of man" and affirmed by Gloucester: "O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world/ Shall so wear out to naught" (IV. vi. 137). This anthropomorphic description of the storm winds emphasizes another parallel which is inherent in the Lear- cosmos relation. The correspondence between the microcosm and the macro- cosm, macrocosmic violence in terms of the microcosm, suggests additional and amplifying correspondences; the kingdom and the family, the body politic and the body domestic, are caught up in this mesh of interlocking connotations. That these correspondences form an intended extension of relevance Gloucester ex- plains: "These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects.... Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father. . . We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollow- ness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves"8 4 For an interesting comment on the position of thp Fool in the storm see R. B. Heilman, This Great Stage (Baton Rouge, 1948), p. 326, n. 8. On the significance of "unbonneted" also see pp. 72-73. 5 Genesis i. 9-IO. All Biblical references are drawn from the Genevan Version. 6 II. iv. 299. The Gentleman is "minded like the weather, most unquietly." 7 Cf. P. V. Kreider, Repetition in Shakespeare's Plays (Cincinnati, 1941), especially " 'Glou- cester's Eyes!' " pp. 194-214. 8 Cf. also J. G. Frazer, The Golden Bough (New York, 935), I, 367: "It was the belief of the ancient Irish that when their kings observed the customs of their ancestors, the seasons were mild, the crops plentiful." Heilman has pointed out (p. 26) that the storm "is obviously a symbol of subversion and perversion, of a turning upside down of the nature of things, of human unnatural- ness." For the full explanation of the system of correspondences see Theodore Spencer, Shakespeare and the Nature of Man (New York, 1949), pp. 135-152, and Moody Prior, The Language of Tragedy (New York, 5947), pp. 84-86.</page><page sequence="4">6o SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY (I. ii. 112-125). The assimilation of the body politic into the equations between the body domestic or the family, the microcosm, and the macrocosm is suggested in the imagery borrowed from political warfare describing military operations: to-and-fro-conflicting and But yet I call you [elements] servile ministers, That will with two pernicious daughters join Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head So old and white as this!9 (III. ii. 2I-24) The eclipses, the jarring elements, the divided kingdom, the disordered family, the demented Lear are firmly linked together in the system of correspondences. At the same time, however, it must be noted that the storm, a perversion of nature, is yet disorder within order and actually presupposes an order. "The storm suggests, on one level, the victory of a nature hostile to humanity; yet the storm is regularly regarded as a convulsion of nature-a disorder which interferes with but does not destroy an essential order which still is. There is chaos in the world; but tragedy sees chaos in perspective; it measures chaos by order. Chaos is irreparable only when it is mistaken for order; when it is felt as disorder, there is still hope. The tragic world is a kind of chaos: the disorder within the soul is pro- jected into the larger world" (Heilman, pp. ii6, 9i). The storm is thus the disorder or purgative necessary to the order or health of the king. It can only be meaningful if taken in this sense and understood to be a necessary evil through which he must live so as to be cured of evil. In the first nine lines of scene ii the storm and the style rise to their greatest pitch. It is in fact only through the rise in the style that the audience comes to feel the full extent of the storm. In these lines Shakespeare reaches the point for which he has been preparing in the preceding two scenes. The re- port which the Gentleman makes in scene i first announces the condition of the king, at war with himself and the elements. This is followed by a digression of thirty-five lines during which the conversation shifts to the fortunes of Cordelia and the activities of the British dukes. Kent recalls the storm hastily before his exit and immediately in the person of the king it breaks in full fury. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks! You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once, That make ingrateful man! The phonetics in these lines is especially remarkable. Most notable is the frequency of fricatives and stops in clusters of onamatopoetic vernacular words chosen to suggest the roughness and harshness of the weather: 9 Cf. Knight, p. W96.</page><page sequence="5">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR 6i blow, crack, cheek, blow, cataract, spout, drench'd, steeples, drown'd, cocks, thought-executing, oak-cleaving thunderbolts, singe, shaking thunder, strike (in the Qq, smite), thick, crack, spill, make.

The combination of a low vowel with a nasal, honored from classical times, occurs most effectively in Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world. Here the -und- group links the three lines inextricably together, providing the equivalent of the continued rumbling of thunder. But after the hissing, the crashing, and the thundering, the passage comes to rest as far as that is possible on the liquids, moulds, all, spill, ingrateful.'0 The passage is one of those in Shakespeare extraordinary for what have been happily termed "amazing" words. Mr. John Crowe Ransom lately," and others before him, have profitably studied etymologies, word origins, and the relationship which they bear to word-position in the line and the sentence and have demonstrated a productive and rewarding method of word-study. Shake- speare is a master of English and of foreign words in English. He is chief cook, and as has been suggested, he uses the same recipe as that recommended by Lear's Fool. Shakespeare does with his words what his "cockney did to the eels when she put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapped 'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried Down, wantons, down!" (II. iv. I23-I27). They behave; the concoction is unsurpassable. But noticeable at once in the passage, basically a paragraph of native or vernacular words, are the foreign importations: Greek KaXrrappaK-rfs,`2 Carib huraca'n,'3 French avant-couriers, and Latin sulfureus, executans, rotunditas, germen, ingratus."4 Like the eels these words remain 10 Granville-Barker has called to our attention (Prefaces, I, 266-267) the poverty and ineffective- ness of the storm machinery on the Elizabethan stage. There can be little doubt, I think, that Shakespeare was suggesting the noises of the storm in the harsh words of his poetry, not in terms of decibels surely, but with an ear to the traditions of classical onomatapoeia. 11 "On Shakespeare's Language," Sewanee Review, LV (1947), i8i-I98. 12 Greek Ka-appabcTrls, "down-rushing," or "waterfall," is cognate with KaTapp-yPIVUL meaning: to break down, tear in pieces, (of storms and waterfalls) to rush down, to fall in, and (medically, of parts of the body) to collapse. It is a violent word in Greek. 13 This form is the term brought back by Spanish explorers of the Caribbean and introduced through their reports into English. It is the word used by the cannibalistic tribe of the Caribs for 'sea storms." The spelling in this reference is one of many in the period. 14 Of these sulph'rous and executing, along with nature and ingrateful, must be allowed to have lost very nearly all of their Latinity by i6oo.</page><page sequence="6">62 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY alive, refusing to submit completely to being Englished; in their alien setting they raise their heads. Cataract appears here in its only use in Shakespeare, though it was a com- mon term throughout the sixteenth century. It was generally understood to refer to the "floodgates of heaven" regarded as holding back the rain or perhaps the waters above the firmament. In this passage, however, it is commonly con- sidered by critics that its primary meaning is "waterspout," a rare though not original application,'5 suggested by its conjunction with hurricano and spout.16 Hurricano is defined by its only other appearance in Shakespeare, in Troilus and Cressida, V. ii. I7I-I73: "the dreadful spout/ Which shipmen do the hurricano call,/ Constring'd in mass by the almighty sun." The meaning as seen by this gloss is "waterspout," so that both these terms have the same significance, as it is thought, and are merely synonymous. Such a reading overlooks much in the pair, and there would seem to be good reason for accepting the more normal meanings "floodgates of heaven" and "sea storms." These latter interpre- tations are considerably richer since they contribute violence to the image, follow the familiar Bible story of the Flood, and evoke Jehovanistic overtones quite in keeping with the character of the protagonist. Rotundity, meaning evidently "roundness," is an instance of a rare Latinism taken over by Shakespeare and used only once. The active stem rotund- was well known in the late sixteenth century from the French or Italian; rotundity, however, is apparently directly from the Latin rotunditas. It is unusually effective in this passage. Germain is a word of Shakespeare's own coinage, from the Latin. It is an "inkhorn" term used with its Latin meaning, "seed," applying presumably to animal as well as to plant semenality. The only other use of germain in Shakespeare is by Macbeth in a speech singularly important to this one. Interesting as are these words in themselves, their combination is even more so. The first line is seen to be an epanalepsis, entirely monosyllabic and Germanic in etymology: "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!" The second is strikingly polysyllabic: "You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout," and combines the classical Greek term with the outlandish barbarism from the cannibals of the New World. Such an astonishing juxtaposition must have been particularly original and exciting to an ear as sensitive to word-play as that of the educated Elizabethan. The third line is again native in origin and, except for one word, monosyllabic: "Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!" Thus is set up the pattern: vernacular/ imported/ vernacular. The three lines taken as a unit, furthermore, are prevailingly monosyllabic and vernacular. The fourth and fifth lines, "You sulph'rous and thotight-executing fires,/ Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts," contain a mixture of words of Latin extraction, the single French innovation, and set against them the short vernacular thought, 15 This interpretation is given for this passage in the NED which lists also both Shakespearian uses of germain and hurricano. 16 The punctuation used by Kittredge (the text here followed) and most modern editors seems to give the lines the clearest reading though it contraverts both Qq and Ff, which is: "blow / You cataracts, and Hurricano's spout,/." It is difficult, almost impossible, to understand why a cataract should blow. Duthie (Shakespeare's King Lear [Oxford: Blackwell, 1949]) follows the Folio. For a discussion of the punctuation of this passage corroborating the emendation here used see my "A Note on King Lear: III. ii. 1-3," Studies in Bibliography (Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, II, [1949-1950]), pp. 175-i82.</page><page sequence="7">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR 63 fires, oak, and cleaving."7 In contrast to the monosyllabic cast of the first three lines, these two lines are generously polysyllabic, with even the native monosyl- lables hyphenated into polysyllables. The sixth and seventh lines are again monosyllabic and vernacular: "Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,/ Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world," with the exception of the all-important Latin rotundity. The position of this word, a heavy, classical im- portation with the characteristic low vowel, is exactly correct in these lines of rough, fricative, native monosyllables. It contrasts vigorously with its surround- ings, it raises its head, it appears in the round, echoing the rumbling of the thunder of the two preceding lines. The passage thus far repeats the pattern of the first three lines: lines I-3, vernacular and monosyllabic (the importations are exceptions) lines 4-5, imported and polysyllabic lines 6-7, vernacular and monosyllabic (the importation is the exception). Lines 8-9 in miniature restate the pattern, equally skillfully: "Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,/ That make ingrateful man." Here in three groups of three words each, bi- or tri-syllabic words of an original Latin extrac- tion are flanked by vernacular or Germanic single syllables.18 The speech in Macbeth referred to above affords a valuable and revealing comparison with the lines in question here. It occurs at the opening of Macbeth's speech to the witches when he visits them in their cavern: I conjure you by that which you profess (Howe'er you come to know it), answer me. Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up; Though bladed corn be lodg'd and trees blown down; Though castles topple on their warders' heads; Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure Of nature's germens tumble all together, Even till destruction sicken-answer me To what I ask you. (IV. i. 5P-60) This speech of Macbeth parallels in many ways the more important speech in Lear: in both the winds and waves are rioting, the churches are threatened, 17 There has been a flurry of scholarship over the exact meaning of thought-executing. One school holds that it signifies "executing as quickly as thought"; the other that it is "executing the thought of the god who cast the bolt." (These opinions will be found in the Variorum, p. i7i.) Either interpretation or both would seem acceptable. Mr. Pringle Barret has called attention (MLN, XLIII [1928], 3i6-317) to the parallel passage in The Tempest I. ii. 20I-203: "Jove's lightnings, the precursors / O' th' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary / And sight-outrunning were not." But the concept of the speed of thought is not lacking elsewhere (Troilus and Cressida IV. ii. 14): "With wings more momentary-swift than thought." 18 Ingrateful applies in three senses: i) displeasing (in a definition close to Latin), 2) harsh or unfriendly, and 3) not showing gratitude. As gratitude is one of the key themes of Lear, the importance of this word is apparent. Its spelling is interchangeable in Shakespeare with the more conventional ungrateful.</page><page sequence="8">64 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY the elemental substances are indicated, the word germens appears, the storm described is one of violent destruction to a point of nausea, and there is in "Con- found and swallow navigation up" and "Their heads to their foundations" the same use of the remarkable Latin word standing in a Germanic environ- ment. The exact biographical or literary connection between these two speeches -if there is any-is difficult if not impossible to determine. They were being written about the same time, and while their dramatic contexts differ greatly they are saying roughly the same thing. It is apparent that the passage in Lear is on a superior level of poetic intensity to that in Macbeth, but this super- iority does not discredit the latter. In its context it is as perfectly suited as is this of Lear. Lear's speech is a "purple" passage because it is climactic in its play. Macbeth's speech is less exciting because it takes place in one of the less climactic scenes in its play. Each subserves the structure of its drama. The exposition of the four elemental substances in the Lear passage is notable. The first line refers to air; the second and third to water; the fourth and fifth to fire; and the remainder to earth. The mention of all the elements affords a completeness lacking in the Macbeth passage which mentions only air and water. The image in Macbeth of the wind "fighting against the churches" is good though not startling, but the "drench'd steeples, drown'd cocks" is better. The violence of the storm in Lear is heightened and increased through the anthropomorphic imagery. In Macbeth the winds are still imagistically the classic winds of the Odyssey to be released from AEolus' bag.19 In Lear, how- ever, as a complement to the king's violence having been described in terms of the weather, the wind has put on the custom of man, the macrocosm become the microcosm, and blows and puffs its cheeks until they crack.20 It is not inappropriate to examine the relationship of the king and the elements at this point as it is revealed in these nine lines and in the following eleven. This tremendous nine-line speech can not be regarded as an accurate though frenzied meteorological report on the state of the weather. Such has already been given by the two faithful retainers at the opening of the Act. These lines are not the statement of one resigned to his fate, for the king is not yet in the purgative stage. If they are regarded as a prayer to the great gods for retribu- tion,"' serious difficulties are encountered in resolving the imprecations hurled at the elements in the second part of the speech, following the lines of the Fool, and including "I tax you not, you elements, with unkindness. . . ." and "But yet I call you servile ministers. . . ." If these lines again form a prayer they differ strikingly from the more easily recognized prayers, "O heavens, if you do love old men" and "Poor naked wretches." They are in fact much closer to the curses of barrenness which they parallel in thought as well as in tone and mood. The Gentleman explains finally the nature of the king's speech: "Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,/ Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main" (III. i. 5-6). This bidding can only be equivalent to the command of the king, as when he says: "bid them [Regan and Cornwall] come forth and hear me,/ Or at their 19 Macbeth's winds are, of course, under the control of the witches (I. iii. I I-I7), but in the verb untie is surely suggested the episode in the Odyssey, Book X. 20 At the same time the cartographer's decoration of the little wind-god must not be forgotten. 21 As does G. Wilson Knight (The Wheel of Fire [Oxford, I930], p. 20I). It seems difficult to reconcile reviling with prayer.</page><page sequence="9">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR 65 chamber-door I'll beat the drum/ Till it cry death to sleep" (II. iv. i18-I20). These wild lines then must be understood as direct orders to the winds, the waves, the thunder, and the lightning. Such an interpretation accords well with what has been seen of the character of the king. The commands of the first nine lines recall those given throughout the earlier part of the play; they are in the same vein. King Lear regards himself still as every inch a king, and shouting his orders to his subordinates, he reveals clearly his proud, arrogant, and stubborn authority. The elements are Lear's servants. But he has given to them, as to Cordelia, Kent, and the Fool, nothing. Here at last the reckoning is made: nothing comes of nothing. From these unfee'd servants Lear no longer receives toadying flattery, he no longer receives even obedience. To a royal philosophy of quid pro quo (or quid pro nihilo), the basis of Lear's erroneous sense of values, comes the awakening: "You owe me no subscription." Nihil pro nihilo. The first lines of the speech command general destruction in which Lear's white head must perforce be singed. The second group of eleven lines is anti-climactic; the destruction does not occur. The tempest continues, how- ever, to beat down on Lear's unprotected head. The realization develops that the elements are no longer his servants; they are in fact his masters, now servilely and venally colleagued with his daughters. He is no longer a king. He dis- covers at this moment when the elements do not obey him that they, allies of his ungrateful daughters, have also thrown off the imperial yoke. Instead of responding to his commands immediately, as he remembers later, they turn on him. "When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out"22 (IV. vi. I02-I05). It is the remarks of the Fool between the two sections of the speech that make this clear: "0 nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door." That is to say, volun- tary submission to your rebelling daughters is to be preferred to enforced submission to the rebelling of nature, which evidently has no longer any in- tention of obeying you. Furthermore, in giving these orders to the elements, Lear is acting in con- formity and parallel with Roman and Celtic tradition. These mythologies both state the ancient position of the king as the creator of the weather, especially of the stormy weather.23 Numa, an early king of Rome, for classical precedent, is recorded to have been able to call on the elements at will.24 An interesting expression of this tradition is seen earlier in Edmund's deception of his father: "I told him the revenging gods/ 'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend" (II. i. 47-48). Though Edmund utters this threat as a means of inciting his father's superstitious nature to action against Edgar, it becomes a "bloody in- struction" which with typical Shakespearian irony returns to plague him. Ed- mund, the parricide, like Lear's daughters, is finally stricken down by the forces that league with the gods. Paradoxically, it is his own head which is eventually "singed." This power of calling on the thunderbolt, which is granted to the king, 22 I do not find any instructions for the thunder to be still. 23 Frazer, II, i8i, i82, i83, and passim. 24 Loc. cit. For the reference to Numa cf. Pliny, IT, xxviii, 13 ff.</page><page sequence="10">66 SHAKESPEARE QUARTRLY exalts him to a position equal to that of Jupiter and identifies him with the Thunderer, the Rain-god, and the Hurler of the Lightnings. As Gloucester says, "He holp the heavens to rain" (III. vii. 62). The king-god Lear demands from the heavens, as is his right, a storm, the violence of which can be paralleled only by the turbid violence of his own mind.25 The extent of the storm must be absolute and final. This is made clear in the imagery first of cataracts and hurricanoes in the quotation. The waters loosed on the land are to be poured from the heavens and raised from the deeps: are to be heavenly and earthly. Such is the nature of Deucalion's flood, "Nec caelo contenta suo est Iovis ira, sed illum/ caeruleus frater iuvat auxiliaribus undis,"26 and of Noah's, "in the same day were the fountaines of the great deepe broken vp, and the windowes of heauen were opened." 27 That Shake- speare had in mind these passages, or at least was thinking of the rising and the falling of the waters as two opposing actions must be admitted. Cataracts are descending waters, of the heavens, and hurricanoes are rising waters, of the earth.28 These senses are corroborated by the verbs which parallel their subjects. Thus cataracts: drench :: hurricanoes: drown. By pouring down, the cataracts of heaven will cause the steeples to drink: by inundation the rising waters of the sea will cover the cocks.29 Lear orders a re- turn of the Hebraic deluge with a covering of the land by the water, a return to a state of near chaos, of elemental confusion.30 The works of man are to be destroyed and even the works of God are to be annihilated. The words of Jehovah announcing the Flood before the building of the ark similarly describe 25 Lear's relation to the ordered universe is disclosed by Mr. Heilman (pp. 266, 270), who recalls the oath "By all the operation of the orbs" with which he disinherits Cordelia and his brief recollection, "the thunder would not peace at my bidding." "The thunder . . . which sym- bolized to him the working of the 'great gods.'" The irony is implicit in the fact that though the thunder did not strike flat the world the gods have answered his prayers and commands to punish his ungrateful daughters. Note also II. iv. I92-I95 for another appeal to the heavenly powers, and for the king's position as director of the "Thunder-bearer" cf. II. iv. 230. 26 Ovid, Metamorphoses I, 274-275 (Loeb ed., I936, p. 20). 27 Genesis vii. ii (and viii. 2). In the Septuagint and the Vulgate the word cataract is used: "rupti sunt omnes fontes abyssi magne, et cataracts cceli apert-e sunt." Cf. also Paradise Lost, XI, 820-825, for the Miltonic description of the flood and for its Satanic counterpart which has unmistakable echoes of this passage, II. I76-i83. 28 On the other hand, the Troilus and Cressida passage quite distinctly regards the hurricane as a descending spout: Not the dreadful spout Which shipmen do the hurricano call, Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear In his descent than shall my prompted sword Falling on Diomed. 29 Shakespeare uses drown to suggest rising waters not infrequently. In Pericles V. i. I93-i96: put me to present pain Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me O'erbear the shores of my mortality And drown me. There are similar uses in Midsummer Night's Dream II. i. 90-ioo, and Richard 11 111. ii. io6-iii. 30 This sort of inundation in moments of awful terror is suggested also in Psalms xlvi. 2 and Revelation viii. 8.</page><page sequence="11">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR 67 the destruction of His own work: "And I, Beholde, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under the heauen: and everything that is in the earth shall perish" (Genesis Vi. I7). As the imagery of cataracts and hurricanes has evoked connotations of destruction comparable to that at the time of the Deluge, so the concluding images suggests the ruin of the Last Judgment. Bolts of thunder and lightning are to flatten out the roundness of the earth,' Nature's moulds are to be cracked and shattered until they are useless, all germains are to be spilled. Such imagery can indicate only eschatological destruction. Bradley has suggested that the theme of the latter day may have been in Shakespeare's mind during the writ- ing of this play, and Lear himself threatens to do undescribable things, the "ter- rors of the earth." 32 Bradley cites specifically the passages in Matthew and Mark generally titled "the little apocalypse," and it may not be irrelevant to point out that in both these scriptural predictions there are descriptions of the time of the Final Judgment which would set it within the time scheme of this play: "the brother shall deliuer the brother to death, and the father the sonne, and the children shall rise against their parents and shall cause them to die" (Mark Xiii. i2). It is not improbable in the light of the importance of the themes of justice and injustice in the play that Shakespeare was thinking in the king's hectic speech in terms of the Day of Judgment when justice shall finally be ac- complished in the world. Moulds thus is to be regarded, with this interpretation of time in mind, as referring to the forms of Plato existent in the creator's mind in accordance with which everything was made that was made. Such a function of the shaping of things is indicated in the Timwus and the Phxedrus though it is more likely that Shakespeare's allusion stems from the more readily available commentaries of the school of Plotinus and the Neoplatonists as revealed in the writings of the Florentine Academy. Plotinus envisions the creation of all existing things as the operation of the generative soul infusing forms with matter: "The Soul, therefore, produces by the forms. The forms she transmits are by her received from the Intelligence. This Intelligence, however, gives the forms to the uni- versal Soul which is located immediately below her, and the universal soul transmits them to the inferior soul [the natural generative power], fashion- ing and illuminating her. The inferior soul then produces.... As she has re- ceived the power of production, and as she contains the reasons which are not the first not only does she, by virtue of what she has received, produce, but she 31 Thunder does appear as a tangible force in 'Shakespeare with the real power to crush and flatten, though more often it exists as a sound only. Cf. Richard 11 I. iii. 8i; 2 Henry VI IV. i. I04; Othello V. ii. 235. Miss Caroline Spurgeon (Shakespeare's Imagery [New York, I936], p. 342) comments thus: "The fury of the elements, described, be it remarked, wholly in terms of the human body, . . . at the height of his half-demented passion, he commands the all-shaking thunder to 'smite flat [So Qq] the thick rotundity o' th' world.' This last amazing image is one of several in Shakespeare, notably in Anthony and Cleopatra, which evoke the spectacle of de- vastating bodily action on so stupendous a scale that the emotions which give rise to it are lifted to a similar terrific and vast intensity." 32 1. iv. 283-285. A. C. Bradley, Shakespearean Tragedy (London, I949), p. 328, n. Knight (Wheel of Fire, p. i96) remarks: "Edgar's trumpet is as the universal judgment summoning vicious man to account."</page><page sequence="12">68 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY also draws from herself something which is evidently inferior [matter]." 3 Plotinus conceived further, and here he extends Plato, of the shaping by man as a not dissimilar process: "all creatures of art and industry are ideal in a secondary sense, in so far that is as they embody the thoughts of the derived intelligence of man. Thus he is able to speak of the form of a house, as Plato spoke of the idea of a bed. . . . What we recognize when we see a house is the plan, the mind of the builder."34 The individual moulds here suggested ap- proach more nearly to Shakespeare's description of complete destruction. Thus the word moulds embraces in Platonic terminology those forms employed by the creator in the general and continued creation and expands in Neoplatonic significance to include those inferior patterns or ideals utilized by man. With the forms or moulds cracked there can evidently be no more creation. Their ruin is even more fundamental, however; without the moulds existence itself ceases. "Every natural image remains what it was, so long as its archetype subsists. It is therefore an error to believe that, while the intelligible world subsists the visible world could perish." 3 Consequently the visible world must perish with the death of the archetypal. The curse against creation in terms of moulds, in terms of pagan Neo- platonism is paralleled by a similar curse in germains, a term of Christian Scho- lasticism. Mr. Curry in his investigation of the latter word as it appears in the quotation already given from Macbeth has indicated the medieval sources of its significance. First [God] created out of nothing a chaotic mass called prime matter, im- pregnated with the germs of all created things, rationes seminales. These rationes seminales represent the material essences which correspond to the examplars in God's mind.... Thus God ... has created already within prime matter the germs of all possible visible things in the world. But the exterior operations of nature depend upon . . . the activities of good or bad men or angels.... These [rationes seminales] may be considered in sev- 33Enneads II, Bk. iii, Plotinos Complete Works, tr. K. S. Guthrie (Alpine [N.J.], i9i8), p. Ii86. Plotinus elsewhere describes in dramatic language the pattern resemblances of the here and yonder: "For since we say that this All is framed after the Yonder, as after a pattern, the All must first exist yonder as a living entity, an animal; and since its idea is complete, everything must exist yonder. Heaven, therefore, must exist there as an animal, not without what here we call its stars, and this is the idea of heaven. Yonder too of course must be Earth, not bare, but far more richly furnished with life; in it are all creatures that move on dry land and plants rooted in life. Sea, too, is yonder, and all water ebbing and flowing in abiding life; and all creatures that in- habit the water, and all the tribes of the air are part of the all yonder, and all trial beings for the same reason as air itself. For how should that which is living not live itself, seeing that even here it lives? Surely then every animal must of necessity be yonder. For as each of the great parts of the world is, so of necessity is the creatures that it contains. As then heaven itself exists yonder, so yonder exist all the animals that dwell in heaven, and it is not possible that it should be other- wise." The word "animals" in this passage embraces not only sentient creatures, but plants and in- organic substances. All share in a kind of life in so far as they are moulded by a word (C. Bigg, Neoplatonism [London, i895], pp. 2I4-2I5). And again: "everything here below derives from above there, and is more beautiful in the superior world; for forms here below are mingled with matter; on high they are pure. Thus this universe proceeds from the intelligible world, and is contained by the forms from beginning to end" (Enneads V, Bk. viii, p. 562). 34 Bigg, pp. 205-206. 35 Enneads V, Bk. viii, p. 572.</page><page sequence="13">THE POETRY OF THE STORM IN KING LEAR 69 eral ways: "In the first place, as Augustine says, they are primarily and originally in the Word of God as typal ideas. Secondly they are in the ele- ments of the world, where they were produced together at the beginning, as in universal causes. Thirdly they are in those things which in the suc- cession of time, are produced by universal causes, for instance in this planet, and in that animal, as in particular causes. Fourthly, they are in the seeds produced from plants and animals." 36 This matter impregnated by God with the germs from which spring all life is created in the beginning, but may be acted upon by men, angels, or demons since these are free agents and capable, chemist-like, of hastening or retarding a reaction which is preordained. Thus in Macbeth the king calls on the weird sisters by virtue of their demonic powers to direct the action of nature's ger- mens. In Lear the king likewise calls out to supernatural powers which have control over the action of the seeds of creative nature. Thus if moulds be allowed to represent form and germains to represent the seeds in matter, or matter informed, it is clear that the destruction is one of both form and matter, is in short the condition of being and existence at the Last Judgment. The world will come to its end, that is to say, will cease to exist as matter, will revert to the chaotic principles, or at least will be banished from the realms of form, while the souls of the blessed will be assumed into the All-Soul, and form and difference will be abolished. It is notable that these images of destruction pertain primarily to crea- tion; they are not directed against already existent beings. Hamlet similarly says, "Those that are married already-all but one-shall live; the rest shall keep as they are" (III. i. I56). To Lear, remembering his serpent children, the consuming evil is parenthood. Hamlet's charge to Ophelia, again, "Get thee to a nunnery," is a means of securing her chastity, and Lear's earlier curses against Goneril are those of barrenness (I. iv. 297 ff. and II. iv. i64-i66). But the concept of the cessation of creation as the prime perquisite of the latter day (even as it occurs in the fulness of time, not only as here ordered prema- turely) appears in Ficino: "the highest and last end of the world which the world must reach at some time ... will be, not movement, but rest.... More- over the body of the world will be most beautiful in that most perfect state. When the course of the heaven through which all things are generated is finally fulfilled, nothing will be generated anymore." 37 A further explanation of the method of destruction to be employed may be drawn from the word germains understood not philosophically, but gesta- tively. Such a connotation evokes an entirely new level of interpretation. The image begins now with the rotundity o' th' world which suggests at once the roundness of the earth as general mother, and secondly the tumescent womb of 36W. C. Curry, Shakespeare's Philosophical Patterns (Baton Rouge, 1937), pp. 34, 36, 39, quoting M. DeWulf, The History of Medieval Philosophy (New York, 1926), I, ii8 ff., and the Summa Theologica, I, 115, 2, c. But cf. the entire chapter, "Tumbling Nature's Germens," pp. 29-49. Mr. Curry is interested in pointing out the actions of the demons (the weird sisters) as well as the sources for this scholastic concept as a commonplace in Renaissance thinking. 37 M.

Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb; Let it no more bring out ingrateful man! Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears; Teem with new monsters. (IV. iii. I77 if.) In the first phrase of the image, "Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world," the womb itself is not damaged; it is merely deflated. This is an action most readily accomplished by the death of the foetus, without the necessity of any harm occurring to the parent. Sir Thomas Browne reports that lightning, the weapon in use in this instance, can indeed accomplish just this. "And if we consider the threefold effect of Jupiter's Trisulk, to burn, discuss, and terebrate; and if that be true which is commonly delivered, that it will melt the blade yet pass the scabbard; kill the child yet spare the mother; dry up the wine, yet leave the hogshead entire; though it favor the amulet it may not spare us." 40 Though Lear's bitterness is directed principally against children (his own and Goneril's), this slaughter is not yet enough. "Crack Nature's moulds" has an- other significance more important than its Platonic meaning. In this progression the mould is the womb. Mould appears with this meaning elsewhere in Shakespeare: speaking of two brothers: "that bed, that womb,/ That metal, that self mould that fashioned thee,/ Made him a man." 41 And finally with a hint of coitus interruptus, "all germains spill at once/ That make ingrateful man." The seeds of the next generation are to be poured out in wastefulness, and, to revert, as in them are the seminal principles of the continuity of the various types of life, all the particular causes of created things cease to exist.42 The reason for this mad ruin is not hard to find: ingrateful man. This is a destruction which like the Noachic Deluge and the Final Judgment is sent as a punishment for filial ingratitude, to overcome all "unnaturalness between the child and the parent." " Its thunderbolts must destroy and abrogate ut- 38 Mr. Heilman has discovered an earlier reference to pregnancy in Edmund's pun at the close of his apostrophe to Nature (I. ii).

Lear's command to Nature in these tremendous lines is for complete de- struction and primordial chaos. Miss Sitwell has pointed out that "Lear . . . in his prayer to Nature to kill the sources of life in his daughters, struck at the very heart of Nature, disturbing that lake of Darknesse, the original chaos from which all being arose." 4 In his command he wills that all creation tumble again into that lake of chaos in a cataclysmic eruption with the characteristics at once of the original Deluge and of the "abomination of desolation" at the Latter Day.
