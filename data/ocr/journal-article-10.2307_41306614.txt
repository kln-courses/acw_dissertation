ISBN 978-0-981-52492-4 The title reveals the author's intention to prove that cultural memory in Romanian folklore is much more ancient than earlier scholars thought possible. Adrian Poruciuc, a professor of Germanic studies, believes that events from four thousand to nine thousand years ago have been preserved in Romanian ritual songs for Christmas. The method of conservation apparently consisted of a repeated translation from the original languages of this distant past to the modern languages. Without any clear ordering principle, seven chapters combine four secular types of carols with architectural discussions on the so-called "woman shape" of churches, in order to convince the reader that prehistory can be excavated from contemporary Romanian traditional culture. Only three chapters focus on ritual folk texts, while the others deal with Greek mythological characters such as Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The first chapter, "The Romanian dolf 'Sea-monster' in Connection with a Greek Lexical Family and with Early Signs of Eurasian Religion," proposes unusual etymologies for the word dolf (a regional term for "dolphin") and tries to argue that the Romanian words bolf bolovan, and dolofan, and the Greek delphax reveal common roots. In fact, bolf means "heavy rock" and is found only in the western mountains of Romania, while dolf carols are sung in Dobrogea, in the east. Dolofan , "chubby," is familiar to the entire country, whereas the regional pronunciation for "dolphin" is only understood in Dobrogea. Moreover, delphax is a Greek word meaning "swine," while dolf and bolovan come from Slavonic languages. Neither word migration nor etymology seems to support the author 's view. Likewise, the statement that the local deity Sfanta Vineri (Saint Friday) comes from the Roman goddess Venus leaps over an intermediate phenomenon. This folk character represents, in fact, an anthropomorphic image of one of the three sacred days of the week, together with Wednesday and Sunday, which are represented as old women with supernatural knowledge. The analysis of Romanian winter songs omits the initiatory dimension of traditional performance. A better knowledge of folklore would have directed the analysis towards other folk genres that use motifs and archetypal structures: fairytales, fantastic ballads, wedding orations, disenchantments, harvesting songs. Despite the chapter title, "The Sea and the Sea-Flood Motif in Romanian Folklore," the author only investigates two carols. The first is directed at girls, while the second is sung to young men - an important detail that is unclear because of the imprecise translation. Instead of "a maid's carol" and "a fisherman's carol," we should read "a carol for a maiden" and "a carol for a fisherman." Unless we make this distinction, one might think that it is the maiden or the fisherman who sings, whereas they are the intended audience for the songs. Both the generic youth and the young fisherman are being initiated into manhood and receive public permission to wed via this type of ritual song, but the latter also benefits from the song's augural function and expects to catch large amounts of fish. Similar inexact translations (such as "fairies' round dance" instead of "ladies' round dance") indicate that a full understanding of the ethnographic circumstances would have been more helpful. The fifth chapter goes back to the secular carols topic after two chapters on architecture, which claim that sacred buildings such as temples and churches have a female shape.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 357 Poruciuc is here inspired by Maria Gimbutas's work and asserts that the two lateral apses, where we usually find the choir, are representations of female breasts. Even more strikingly, the entrance in these religious buildings apparently symbolises the birth canal. "Thracian Lions and Romanian Lion Carols" asserts that "today's Romanian lion carols still function as well-wishing songs included in Christmas and New Year celebrations" (p. 62). In fact, carols are only sung for Christmas, whereas mask plays are used on New Year's Eve. Usually, Romanians use zoomorphic masks such as the bear, the goat, and the stag, all bearing the mark of old pastoral rituals connected with the veneration of ancestors. The author insists that the existence in northern Moldova of a lion mask in the New Year ritual is evidence for events that took place nine millennia ago. In fact, the lion mask is only used in Pa§cani, Ia§i, which is situated in the Central Moldavian Plateau, in the middle of the region, and not in the north. Moreover, the lion carol has never been sung in Moldavian villages, and this fact leaves the whole argument without empirical support. People from Pa§cani have also created strange elephant and chimpanzee masks, while in Tupilati, Neam^, a tiger is added to old symbols of the dying year. These animals do not represent the Romanian fauna and are mere innovations, devoid of any ritual significance. After a chapter on "Orpheus's Name and Function," Poruciuc writes on "Folk-Orphic Survivals and Christianized Variants" and creates a mix of Maria Gimbutas's ideas, folklore, archaeology, and history. The author considers the "old fairy" to be a Demeter- type deity similar to Saint Friday. In fact, this sacred character appears in funeral songs and also in birth imagery, as she is a goddess of fate. She is analogous to Atropos from Greek mythology and decides how long a person gets to live. The book is a clear example of the fallacy of considering traditional culture to be a facile and all-permitting field. Romanian folklore demands a rigorous investigation with proper methodology because it has managed to preserve some pagan spiritual information in harmony with Christian beliefs. The author repeatedly assures the reader that he is very knowledgeable about folklore, but he often reaches false conclusions - such as: "in many dolf- carols I know, the name of the hero is Gheorghe" (p. 119). Here, Poruciuc tries to argue that Saint George influenced the heroic pattern of the carols, but he forgets to mention that the name of the main character changes for each person the carol is sung to. Hence, the youths listening to the carol (and bearing various names) become heroes and experience initiation into manhood thanks to the magic function of the words spoken at sacred times such as Christmas. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming second volume, announced by the author, will not prefer speculations, fanciful etymologies, imprecise data, and misinformation to a rigorous philological and ethnological analysis.
