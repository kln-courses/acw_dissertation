Texts and Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Judaism 15. Tilbingen: J.C.B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1999. Pp. x + 297. DANIEL ABRAMS, Bar-Ilan University Scholarship on the history of Jewish mysticism has undergone many changes and upheavals in this century. Despite the publication of major thematic, textual, and historical studies on all aspects of Jewish mysticism, the early history of Jewish mysticism in Europe and the emergence of the kabbalah remain an enigma. Mystical treatises on the "unique cherub" (run imsen) which were composed in this period are an important key to under- standing this problem. Joseph Dan's latest book, "The Unique Cherub": A School of Mystics and Esoterics in Medieval Germany, seeks to elucidate some of the main features of this body of texts and to demonstrate their relationship to early kabbalah. The book contains fifteen chapters on various aspects and texts related to the "unique cherub circle" and an appendix entitled "The Language of the Mystics in Medieval Germany." The opening chapter of the book, "Tradi- tion, Schools and Pseudepigraphy in the High Middle Ages," places these texts in the wider historical and literary context of pre-kabbalistic Jewish mystical works. The bulk of the book, however, is devoted to more detailed analyses of specific works and the history of specific symbols and terms. As a whole, the book seeks to encompass the various facets of the works in this collection. It is highly readable and presents the conclusions of Joseph Dan's years of study on the topic. Dan's book takes its place in a long line of scholarship on these early medieval Jewish mystical texts. Dan himself has published numerous stud- ies on early Jewish mysticism, German Pietism, the "unique cherub circle," and early kabbalah, some of which directly culminated in this new mono- graph. 1 The first treatment of the "unique cherub" texts was undertaken by Abraham Epstein in his article "The Origins of the Ashkenazi Kabbalah," 'Joseph Dan, "Ashkenazi Hasidism and the Maimonidean Controversy," Mai- monidean Studies 3 (1993) 29-47, and "Pseudepigraphy in Medieval Jewish Mysti- cism in Germany," Fdlschungen im Mittelalter.

Scholem further un- covered an important manuscript in New York which preserved, according to his understanding, an integration of Ashkenazic forms of mysticism with the emerging kabbalah. Despite these observations, Scholem accepted Epstein's assumption that the works on the "unique cherub" were composed by the Pietists, and so Scholem composed a synthetic description of the theology of the two in the third chapter of his Major Trends. It was not until 1966 that a major advance was made in understanding the works concerning the "unique cherub." Dan outlined the main characteris- tics of the theology of the "unique cherub circle," and provided an annotated listing of their works.5 In so doing, Dan separated these works from the cor- pus of the German Pietists and so brought the earlier, integrated picture of early medieval Jewish mysticism to its deconstructed extreme of Pietist, "unique cherub," and kabbalistic works. The "unique cherub" works were copied in manuscript codices alongside the works of the German Pietists. Indeed, much of the language appears quite similar. The works were not copied together because of their affinity or the confusion of some medieval copyist. Rather, this transmission testifies to a history of reception among students of the two bodies of literature who sought to integrate the different works and theologies. And so, in light of Scholem's synthetic treatment of the two, the question of the relationship between German Pietist traditions and that of the "unique cherub" remains open. Were the earliest texts written before or after the literary activity of the "unique cherub" figures? Did R. Eleazar of Worms know of these works and are there similar traditions which appear in his writings that can point to Tarbiz 61 (1992) 249-271 [Hebrew]; "Pesaq Ha-Yirah ve-ha-Emunah and the Inten- tion of Prayer in Ashkenazi Hasidic Esotericism," Frankfurter Judaistische Beitrdge 19 (1991/2) 185-215; "The Language of the Mystics in Medieval Germany," in Mysti- cism, Magic and Kabbalah in Ashkenazi Judaism: International Symposium Held in Frankfurt a.M. 1991, ed.

In short, much of the research of the last decade has focused on the chronology and trajectory of the traditions discussed. Connections have been explored, first between these two circles; and second, between these corpora and mystical traditions which emerged prior to the medieval mystics in Europe, and those which were produced after the development of kabbalah. In what follows, I will outline the rich history of scholarship on these questions which has been overlooked in the book under review. The history of speculation on the cherub begins with the tenth chapter of Ezekiel, where, as David Halperin has shown, a commentator reacted to passages in Ezekiel's vision in the first chapter, a vision which would later be the focus of mystical speculation in the Rabbinic period.6 Asi Farber explored the possibility of antique speculation on the cherub in Hekhalot texts. In her doctoral dissertation "The Concept of the Merkabah in Thirteenth Century Jewish Esotericism: Sod Ha-'Egoz and Its Development,"7 Farber discussed a manuscript witness of Massekhet Hekhalot which preserved the reading, "and there are arranged the most wondrous cherubim, [the] wheels of the chariot" (n:nn t)A)' ot)xmo m)x'o ):nt inn owl) instead of "which is placed and arranged like many fiery appearances" (o)xN'o ')x~o t1vn inin owl nzixn n1 ). With this variant, Farber sought to push back the early history of the idea of a "special cherub": One should note that in the doctrine of the "Special Cherub Circle" the names and characterizations of the Special Cherub emerge from within the context of the anthropomorphic tradition of the Shi'ur Qomah traditions, which sought to place at the top of a complex theophany an anthropomorphic angelic form (connected to the con- cept of an elevated cherub or Cherubiel, from the visionary tradition of Ezekiel and its reverberations in Hekhalot literature), an aspect of the anthropomorphic manifestation of the divine. Hekhalot literature is replete, as is well-known, with a particular blurring of the bound- aries between God and the chief angels of the chariot, who receive ap- pellations, characterizations and descriptions which have much in common with each other. This is instructive of the possible existence of the vestiges or elaborations of binary and pleromatic doctrines.8 Farber explored these themes in a host of medieval mystical texts, show- ing a nexus of traditions in the works of Eleazar of Worms in which the "beast (hayyah) named Israel" is identified with the cherub. Farber's research 6 David Halperin, "The Exegetical Character of Ezek. X 9-17," Vetus Testamentum 26 (1976) 129-141. 7 The Hebrew University, 1986, pp. 309-310, 556 [Hebrew]. 8 Ibid., p. 309.</page><page sequence="4">400 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW therefore laid the groundwork for further explorations into the cross- fertilization of traditions in medieval Europe. The focus of Farber's rather comprehensive investigation into merkavah speculation was, however, a group of texts known as the "Secret of the Nut," which for a variety of reasons display possible ties to Hekhalot texts and German Pietism. One of the re- censions of the "Secret of the Nut" was reworked with "special cherub" tra- ditions.9 In yet another important observation by Farber, the angel Keruviel seems to have special status in the hierarchy of angels in 3 Enoch. 10 In my analysis of the Hekhalot manuscripts and their reception, I showed that Keruviel was not granted a special rank among the angels. This can be found only in the Pietist reworking of the Hekhalot text. 11 A link between ancient Jewish mysticism and medieval Jewish esoteri- cism in Europe was demonstrated by Klaus Herrmann in his study, "'Feuer aus Wasser': Zum Fortleben unbekannten Sefer Yesira-Kommentars in der Hekhalot Literature." 12 In this article, Herrmann published a commentary on the Book of Creation, a text which influenced traditions of the Hekhalot manuscripts. This text seeks to integrate merkavah speculation with the Book of Creation, generally understood until now to be a characteristic of medieval Jewish mysticism. The text is even more important to the present inquiry as it seems to be the textual basis for two of the more central works of the cherub circle, the Berayta of Joseph ben Uzziel and the Commentary to the Book of Creation by El4anan ben Yakar. 13 In his study "The Image of Jacob which is Inscribed on the Divine Throne: An Additional Study on the Esoteric Doctrine of German Pietism," 14 Elliot Wolfson analyzed central Pietist traditions which are strikingly similar to those found in the cherub works: Indeed, in the theosophy of the circle of Judah the Pious, the cherub oc- cupied a prominent position as the enthroned form described in terms of enormous physical measurements as they are transmitted in the Shi'ur Qomah tradition. It is impossible to enter into the depths of the esoteric teaching of the German Pietists without turning an attentive ear to the matter of the cherub. It is possible that the shared emphasis 9 See Daniel Abrams, Sexual Symbolism and Merkavah Speculation in Medieval Germany: A Study of the Sod ha-Egoz Texts (Tiubingen, 1997).

Toward the beginning of the anthology traditions are mentioned in the name of R. [= the Rabbi], and later the name of Eleazar is stated explicitly. In a crucial passage, Metatron is identified as the rekhev meyuhad, which Dan corrects to read keruv meyuhad, "the special cherub." In light of his analysis of German Pietist traditions, Wolfson argued that the original transcription should be main- tained, further demonstrating a nexus of traditions within the Pietist circle that may have influenced the authors of the earliest works on the special cherub. I later investigated additional manuscript anthologies which demonstrated that, contrary to Scholem's original supposition, Shem Tov bar Simha was not a 13th-century student of Eleazar of Worms, who had one of the first oppor- tunities to produce an integrated picture of the various schools of thought. 19 Rather, Shem Tov was a 14th- or even 15th-century anthologizer of these texts; his anthology is preserved in a number of manuscripts with better readings of his sources found in many other important codices. The tradition on Metatron mentioned above is found elsewhere in the name of Nahmanides, who was often referred to as the "Rabbi." The reading in the JTSA manuscript, that Metatron "is a rekhev meyuhad" (imrn1 :tn in)) is corrupt and should read: "Metatron is not a davar meyuhad" (imn'n tnt i)z, that is, not a separate entity. The error was apparently introduced by a late copyist who was influ- enced by the other special cherub traditions contained in this collection. These additional texts shed much light on the evolution of the idea of an l5 Ibid., pp. 61-62. 16 Ibid., p. 62; see also his discussion in Through a Speculum that Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism (Princeton, 1994), pp. 232-234. 17Mysticism, Magic and Kabbalah in Ashkenazi Judaism, pp. 60-92; Wolfson, Along the Path, p. 129. 18Joseph Dan, "The Vicissitudes of the Esotericism of the German Hasidim," Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to Gershom G.

In an attempt to plot the course of cherub traditions, I investigated the in- tention of prayer (kavvanah) in early and late texts which know of the cherub. To this end, in "Evolution of the Intention of Prayer to the 'Special Cherub': From the Earliest Works to a Late Unknown Treatise," I outlined three stages in the development of the special cherub traditions.20 I dis- cussed the soft and hard adaptation of sefirotic symbolism. New sources were presented showing that kabbalists were actively using these texts as part of the continued appropriation of traditions which were never the ex- clusive property of any identifiable social community or circle of mystics. Such an appreciation has far-reaching implications for the reading of the earlier texts as they were copied by these later mystics and kabbalists. For example, one copyist and student of a central cherub text apparently could not understand or accept the focus of prayer to the Kavod and so, presuming there to be a confusion in terms due to orthographic similarity, replaced the term Glory (tni)) with cherub (ntr3).21 The reception of the manuscript tra- ditions must therefore be appreciated as a necessary part of the inquiry into the history of influence of cherub speculation.22 Other later uses of these texts include R. Moses ben Eleazar ha-Darshan who, in the 13th century, composed a commentary on the Shicur Qomah texts, in which he incorporated traditions from German Pietism, theosophic kabbalah, and the special cherub. R. Moses is an important figure for appre- ciating the 13th century as a crossroads from earlier forms of medieval Jew- ish mysticism to the theosophic speculation of the kabbalah. As Scholem has demonstrated, Moses ha-Darshan was in possession of an early version of textual traditions by the name of Sod ha-Gaddol, which were trans- formed into the theosophic recension of the Book Bahir. Scholem identified this otherwise mysterious text with a work bearing a similar name, Raza Rabba, which is mentioned by title alone in the 9th century. This early at- tempt by Scholem to bridge the "Orient" with the later figures of German Pi- etism and further, with early kabbalah has since been called into question.23 Almost all of our assumptions about the origin and history of these texts and traditions have been questioned to some degree, including the assumed German setting of their composition. As early as the 1970s, Scholem pointed to France as their place of origin,24 a conclusion which was further discussed 20 Frankfurter Judaistische Beitrage 22 (1995) 1-26. 21 Abrams, "The Evolution," p. 8, n. 28. 22For a different example of the same replacement of terms see Abrams, "Spe- cial Angelic Figures," p. 371. 23 See Daniel Abrams, The Book Bahir: An Edition Based on the Earliest Manu- scripts (Los Angeles, 1994), pp. 27-29 [Hebrew]. 24Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1974), p. 41; reprinted from the En- cyclopaedia Judaica.</page><page sequence="7">A HISTORY OF THE UNIQUE CHERUB-ABRAMS 403 by Moshe Idel.25 Idel has additionally shown the late influence of cherub tra- ditions, broadening the historical perspective of our interest in these texts.26 Finally, we must consider the term meyuhad. Farber has suggested that the technical term reflects on the cherub's position in the throne world: he is sin- gled out among the angelic forces to play a certain role.27 In light of the later tradition concerning Metatron recorded in the name of Nahmanides, it might be best to see at least some of the works in question as emphasizing the on- tological continuum between the transcendence of the divine and the visual- ized theophany represented by the cherub. The cherub is therefore "special" in that it is not a separate being, like the angels and beasts of the throne world, but constitutes a part of the complex godhead, to borrow Scholem's term. We might therefore wish to question our use of the term "theosophy" as a marker for the emergence of kabbalah.28 Moreover, in later texts, prayer is directed to the cherub and not to the transcendent Glory or Holiness. The term keruv ha- meyuhad might best be rendered "the sanctified cherub," as it is the only entity in the divine world to which prayers are intended.29 These examples point to what Moshe Idel has termed a binary theosophy, which characterizes the intention of prayer in Provenqal kabbalah.30 And so here too, in one of the earliest kabbalistic texts which Asher ben David records in the name of his grandfather, R. Abraham ben David, only two aspects in a theosophy are mentioned, and not more, as is implied by the cor- rupt reading known to Scholem and discussed by others who relied on his early work.3' With this in mind, the speculation on the "special cherub" sheds more light on the emergence of kabbalah and brings us closer to a more com- prehensive appreciation of Jewish esotericism and theosophic doctrines. Dan's book will inspire many to return to these important issues, reread the texts and some day realize the publication of all the manuscript sources. 25 Idel, Golem: Jewish Magical and Mystical Traditions on the Artificial Anthropoid (Albany, 1990), p. 267. 26 Moshe Idel, "Between the Kabbalah of Jerusalem and the Kabbalah of R.
