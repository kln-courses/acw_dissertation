<plain_text><page sequence="1">AKIRA SHIMADA THE GREAT RAILING AT AMARAVAT?: AN ARCHITECTURAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION The Amar?vat? st?pa, located in the lower Krishna valley in the modern state of Andhra Pradesh, is the main component of the most important Buddhist site in South India (fig. i). The st?pa was discovered by a local zamind?r in the late eighteenth century and yielded, through successive excava tions in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a large number of sculptures and inscriptions, data ble from ca. 200 BCE to 250 CE and beyond. Due to the unsystematic nature of the nineteenth-cen tury excavations, however, the st?pa was completely destroyed.1 The st?pas architectural development and its chronology thus pose many difficult and unanswered questions. Based on the discovery of a few inscriptions recording royal names of the S?tav?hanas, scholars have thus far assumed that primary construction of the st?pa was accomplished under the S?tav?hana dynasty, which ruled the larger part of the Deccan and Andhra region after the demise of the Mauryan empire (ca. 321-185 BCE ). Because the dynastic history of the S?tav?hanas has been largely unfixed, however, scholars mainly argued the detailed date of the st?pa based on rigorous formal analyses of the sculptures and inscriptions. Such analyses have been combined with a variety of chronologies of the S?tav?hanas and other early Indian sculptures to create numerous theories on the date of the Amar?vati sculptures and the st?pa. How ever, no decisive conclusion on these dates has been reached. In an attempt to remedy this situation, this article focuses on the fully-sculptured limestone rail ing that surrounded the st?pa (fig. 2), which earlier studies have treated as a crucial clue to under standing the chronology of the monument. To clarify the argument and propose a comprehensive view of the chronology of the railing, this paper attempts to contextualize the chronological argument into the actual construction process of the railing. For this purpose, the paper is divided into two parts. In Part I, early excavation records will be examined to ascertain the original configuration of the railing. Most of these records have not been fully studied, understood, or published, yet they provide impor tant clues about the building sequence. In Part III argue for a new chronology of the railing based on sculptural, numismatic, and epigraphic evidence. While much of this evidence will be known to spe cialists, epigraphic reinterpretations and numismatic discoveries along with new archival research necessitate a thorough reassessment of Amar?vat? and its historical development. 1 The present remains of the Amar?vat? st?pa consist of a low drum surrounded by granite and limestone rail pillars. This is, however, a modern reconstruction by the Archaeological Survey of India using excavated objects. 89</page><page sequence="2">PART I AN ARCHITECTURAL RECONSTRUCTION I. Phases of Limestone Railing Construction Those who have written on Amar?vat? have long noted that the limestone railing exhibits a variety of sculptural styles that appear to have been produced during different construction periods.2 Although there are various opinions as to how many stylistic periods can be discerned, the theory of three peri ods or phases, first proposed by Douglas Barrett, is the most reasonable, since it accords with the dif ferent sizes of the extant railing components, as well as with the obvious stylistic differences in the railing sculptures (Table I).3 According to Barrett's theory, the railing of the first phase was relatively small and simple (fig. 3). The components - rail pillars, crossbars, and coping stones - are carved on their inner faces only with non-narrative motifs such as lotus medallions and yaksas carrying garlands. The carving is shallow but sharp. In the second phase, the railing becomes larger (fig. 4). Both inner and outer faces are fully sculpted and the figures given a degree of three-dimensional volume. The inner sides are carved with various narrative reliefs.4 Finally, in the third phase, the railing becomes larger again and the sculptural features change significantly (fig. 5X5 The lower borders of the pillars show a frieze of running animals, unlike those of the second phase, which always depict intricate floral devices (fig. 6). The figures in the third phase are now more slender and their action more dramatic. These figures are also densely packed, and wear a greater variety of ornaments. It is only in this third phase that images of the Buddha appear.6 These stylistic and iconographie features prefigure the N?g?rju nakonda sculptures of the Iksv?ku period, a phase not represented in the Amar?vat? railing. 2 C.

Barrett's theory is widely accepted by other scholars such as Huntington. See Suzan L. Huntington with contributions by John C. Huntington, The Art of Ancient India (New York and Tokyo: Weather Hill, 1985), 176-78. Knox's catalogue of Amar?vat? sculptures also follows Barrett's view (Knox, Amaravati, 34-40). 4 Barrett, and Knox following him, pointed out that some rail pillars are richer in decoration than the first-phase pil lars but simpler than the second-phase pillars (Barrett, Sculptures from Amaravati, 41 [types 2-4] ; Knox, Amaravati, 36-38, 48-49 [types 2-4]). According to my measurements, these pillars are the same size as the second-phase rail pillars. Thus these pillars should be regarded as a variation of the second-phase railing. 5 The precise heights of the third-phase pillars are not clear because there is no intact example. According to my meas urements, the existing fragments of this type measure ca. 140-145 cm from the bottom of the lower border to the cen ter of the central roundel (Knox, Amaravati, nos. u-14; Sivaramamurti, Amaravati Sculptures, pis. 33.1-2, 38-2). The same part of the second-phase pillars, on the other hand, measures ca. 125-130 cm (Knox, Amaravati, nos. 4-6, 8-10; Sivaramamurti, Amaravati Sculptures, pis. 32.1-2,34.1-2; 35.1-2). Thus, we can estimate that pillars of the third phase are 20-30 cm taller than those of the second phase. 90</page><page sequence="3">The three distinct phases prompt some simple but important questions: Were the three railing types - all of different sizes - part of a single railing around the st?pa} If this is the case, why and in what manner did these stylistic variants coexist at the st?pa? To solve these and related problems, we need to reconstruct the final configuration of the railing in as much detail as possible. To this end, I propose to examine the available data from the Amar?vat? excavations of the nineteenth century, the period when most of the railings were obtained. 2. Reconstruction of the Railing Colonel Colin Mackenzie's Survey (1816-17) As noted above, the modern discovery of the Amar?vat? st?pa dates to the end of the eighteenth cen tury. The manner of its discovery, however, was far from fortunate for the monument. The local zamind?r who first noticed the site, Raja Vessareddy Nayudu, was at the time searching for building materials for his new residence at Amar?vat?, and struck D?paldinne, or Hill of Lamps, the unexca vated remains of the great st?pa. Finding that the mound contained many bricks, limestone pillars, and panels, Nayudu and the local people appropriated them for the construction and embellishment of their residences and other public buildings.7 The zamind?r also ordered the center of the mound to be dug up in search of treasure, and then converted the excavated hole into a large reservoir (fig. 7). Work continued until March 1816, when the zamind?r suddenly died.8 Colin Mackenzie, later the first Surveyor General of India, heard of the discovery of the ancient mound and visited Amar?vat? in 1797.9 On this visit, Mackenzie briefly described the mound and noted ten pieces of sculpture that had been moved from the mound to the nearby Amaresvara temple. His short report on the visit, published in 1807, includes brief descriptions of these pieces with a few drawings; none of the pieces seems to have survived to the present. After this brief survey, Mackenzie 6 As far as I am aware, the only piece that might represent a Buddha image in the second phase is a coping in the British Museum, which Barrett understands as representing King Suddhodana's meeting with Buddha at Kapilavastu (Bar rett, Sculptures from Amaravati, 6j, no. 43 ; Knox, Amaravati, no. 36). Barrett identifies a monk-like figure being adored by lay people and other monks as the Buddha. However, there is no evidence to identify this figure as Buddha since, as Barrett admits, it has no halo. It is more likely that it represents a disciple of Buddha or an important monk. 7 Some of these reused sculptures were recently found at Amaresvara temple. See P. Sitapati and V. V. Krishna Sastry, New Satavahana Sculptures from Andhra Amaravathi (Hyderabad: The Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1980). 8 See Colin Mackenzie, "Account of Extracts of a Journal," Asiatick Researches 9 (1807): 272-278, and "Ruins of Amur varty, Depaldina, and Durnakotta," Asiatic Journal 15 (1823): 470-471. According to this work, the raja seems to have discovered a stone casket which contained a crystal box with a small pearl, some small leaves of gold, etc. These were collected by Elliot and sent to the Madras Museum; James Burgess, The Buddhist Stupas of Amaravati andjaggayapeta (London: Tr?bner, 1887; rpt., New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, 1996), 22 and 99, pi. 53.4-7. 9 Mackenzie, "Account of Extracts," 272. Strangely, however, a drawing of an Amar?vat? sculpture attached to this report is dated to 1798 (ibid., pi. b enlarged). My thanks to Jennifer Howes for sharing this information. On the basis of this evidence as well as her own survey of Mackenzie's manuscripts, Howes suggests that Mackenzie could have arrived at Amar?vat? in 1798. See Jennifer Howes, "Colin Mackenzie and the Stupa at Amaravati," South Asian Studies 18 (2002): 54. 91</page><page sequence="4">could not revisit Amar?vat? until March 1816.10 Although local people had already destroyed the st?pa, he undertook a more intensive survey with his staff at this time. Mackenzie left Amar?vat? in August 1816, but his staff remained at the site until October 1817 and made detailed drawings of the site and the exposed sculptures.11 Because of the destruction at the st?pa mound, early studies have assumed that the st?pa had lost its architectural and archaeological contexts before Mackenzie's survey. Mackenzie's survey documents show, however, that this assumption is not correct. According to Mackenzie's site plan dated March 1816, when his team started the survey, the limestone railing was still mostly covered with soil except for twenty-one rail pillars in the southeast quadrant.12 This railing configuration was basically unchanged in another site plan dated June 1817,13 although Mackenzie's team seems to have further uncovered the southern end of the quadrant and the south gate by this time (fig. 7). This observation is corroborated by Mackenzie's survey report in 1823, which states, "A great part of the mound remains uncleared; of the exterior row [i.e. the railing] only the southeast quarter, and the entrance in that direction have been opened."14 In terms of the limestone railing, therefore, Mackenzie's 1816-17 sur vey focused exclusively on the southeastern part, more specifically the south gate and parts of the rail ing to the east of it.15 Fortunately, Mackenzie's records also tell us what railing types stood in the area surveyed. Four teen drawings of rail pillars made by Mackenzie are an important source of evidence in this regard. Although the pillars in these drawings no longer survive except for a few pieces, the detailed draw ings clearly show their typological and iconographie features (fig. 8). In addition, Jennifer Howes's recent study has confirmed two more rail pillars found by Mackenzie, now in London and Chennai, which were not recorded in the surviving drawings (fig. 9).16 We thus have a record of sixteen pillars that almost certainly stood in the southeast quadrant (Table II). An examination of their stylistic fea io Although Mackenzie did not do an intensive survey at Amar?vat? until 1816, his staff may have visited Amar?vat? sev eral times between 1797 and 1816. See H. H. Wilson, Ariana Antiqua: A Descriptive Account of the Antiques and Coins of Afghanistan (London: The Court of Directors of The East India Company, 1841), 32-33. This is supported by the unpublished Mackenzie drawings at the Asiatic Society in Kolkata, where I have consulted two Amar?vat? drawings dated February 1807 and December 1808 (Asiatic Society, MS4, nos. 112 and 125). 11 Robert Sewell, Report on the Amaravati Tope (London : Her Majesty's Stationary Office, 1880; rpt., Varanasi : Bharatiya Publishing House, 1973), 13 ; Howes, "Colin Mackenzie," 55. A series of these drawings are now preserved in the British Library as an album (BL,OIOC,WD 1061; hereinafter: Mackenzie Album), which can be viewed on the library web site (http://www.bl.uk/collections/amaravati/mackamaravati.html). See also other, separate drawings (BL, OIOC, WD 790, 756, 806, 848,1425, 2652). Another set of drawings seems to have existed in the library of the Asiatic Soci ety of Bengal (now the Asiatic Society, Kolkata); it was borrowed from the library by Walter Elliot in 1846, submit ted to the Governor of Madras in 1854, and lost thereafter. See Letter of Walter Elliot to the Chief Secretary of the Gov ernment, dated 23 November 1854, Board Collection, No. 172608 (BL, OIOC, F/4/2648). 12 Mackenzie Album, folio 6. The drawing is also reproduced in Sewell, Report on the Amaravati Tope, pi. 1. 13 Mackenzie Album, folios 7 and 8. The drawing is reproduced in James Fergusson, Tree and Serpent Worship: or Illus trations of Mythology and Art in India in the First and Fourth Centuries after Christ from the Sculptures of the Buddhist Topes at Sanchi and Amravati, 2nd ed.

See Howes, "Colin Mackenzie," 63. 16 Ibid., 63. 92</page><page sequence="5">tures yields an important finding: a full thirteen of them undoubtedly belong to the third phase; the remaining three are second phase. We may conclude, therefore, that the southeast part of the railing, including the south gate, consisted mainly of third-phase pieces. For a schematic illustration of this distribution, see Figure 18. In addition to locating the area of Mackenzie's 1816-17 campaign and the type of sculptures he found, Mackenzie's record enables us to partially reconstruct the sequence of the rail pillars on the east ern side of the south gate, thanks to field numbers recorded on the Mackenzie Amar?vat? album at the British Library.17 A key to the sequence lies in folio 74, which depicts a narrow pillar with lotuses and the inner side of a rail pillar, which are numbered " 57 " and " 58 " respectively in the pencil notes. Inter estingly, folio 73 depicts the inner face of a rail pillar that is also numbered "57." This most probably means a pillar, numbered 57, is recorded from different directions in the two drawings, i.e., the nar row side depicted in folio 74 and the broad inner face in folio 73. We may also presume that folio 74 records two pillars from one direction: (1) one side of pillar no. 57 and (2) the inner face of pillar no. 58. These two pillars were thus connected in an L-shape. In addition, by following the design of the lower borders of the rail pillars, we can see that the pillars and crossbars in folios 77,75, and 76 formed a sequence that directly connects to pillar "58" in folio 74.This sequence could only have been located in the part of the railing exposed in 1817, i.e. the eastern side of the south gateway. Finally, a comment in folio 72 ("3rd stone east of no. 57") tells us that the rail pillar depicted on that folio stood east of a pillar numbered "57" (folio 73), interconnected by a row of crossbars. The size and the iconographical features of these pieces are those of the third phase. Walter Elliot's Excavation (184$) Some three decades after Mackenzie's survey, a second excavation of the st?pa was undertaken by Wal ter Elliot in 1845. In a mission lasting just a few months, Elliot collected a large number of sculptures and sent them to Madras. These pieces were later assembled with the Mackenzie pieces which had been kept at Masulipatan, and sent to London after a catalogue and photographic records were made.18 These pieces now constitute the core of the Amar?vat? collection in the British Museum. 17 Mackenzie Album (http://www.bl.uk/collections/amaravati/mackamaravati.html). 18 William Taylor, On the Elliot Marbles being a report by the Reverend William Taylor (Madras: Government of Madras, [1856?]); Linnaeus Tripe, Photographs of the Elliot Marbles and of Other Subjects in the Central Government Museum, Madras ( [Bangalore] : n.p., [1859]). It should be noted that when Tripe took photographs of these sculptures in 1858, six more pieces had joined the collection (Tripe, Photographs of the Elliot Marbles, nos. 130/135,131/134,132/133,136/137,138/139, 140/141). Barrett mentions that these pieces were dug from the st?pa mound by the Head Assistant Collector of Gun tur, and reached Madras between 1856 and 1858 (Barrett, Sculptures from Amaravati, 24). Although I could not find the source of Barrett's information, Elliot's letter to the government dated 1854 states that "other sculptured remains are or were still to be seen lying exposed in the neighborhood of Amuravatty and that some of these are worthy of being transported to Madras." Government accepted this suggestion and approved the removal of the remaining sculptures to Madras. The six pieces mentioned above may have come to Madras on this occasion. See Letter of Wal ter Elliot to the Chief Secretary of the Government, dated 23 November 1854, Board Collection, No. 172.608 (BL, OIOCF/4/2648). 93</page><page sequence="6">Although Elliot seems to have made a considerable number of notes and sketches during the exca vation, most of them were lost during their transport to England.19 Elliot did leave a brief account of his work in an unpublished letter of 1854 and a short report in 1872, but the surviving field records of this excavation consist of only a few pencil sketches and notes.20 Around 1880, these sketches and notes were hand copied by Robert Sewell, who excavated the st?pa after Elliot (see below). Elliot's originals and Sewell's copies are now kept in the Department of Asia, the British Museum.21 One of Elliot's sketches clearly represents the north side of the west gate since it accompanies notes describing the west gate (fig. 10; Appendix I ). Because of this sketch and the 1872 report - the only published record of his excavation that mentions one of the four entrances - most scholars believed that Elliot excavated around the west gate only.22 This is not correct. A second sketch also depicts part of a gate, and according to my survey, this is in fact part of the north gate (fig. 11). Three pieces of evi dence support this view. First is a comment by Elliot at the bottom left of the second sketch, which can be read as "N. Gateway East." Second is Elliot's undated letter to a person named Shaw, now in the British Museum. This letter, which has not drawn attention to date, includes a detailed account of the north gate, which exactly agrees with the sketch in question (Appendix II ). This letter was most certainly studied by Sewell since his document "The North Gateway as seen by Sir Walter Elliot in 1845" precisely corresponds to this letter. The third piece of evidence is a photograph recording a panoramic view of the st?pa after J. G. Horsfall's excavation in 1880. At the location of the north gate, the photograph shows a corner rail pillar that is also recorded in Sewell's hand copy describing the north gate.23 There is little doubt, therefore, that Elliot uncovered the north gate. The only problem with this interpretation is that Elliot did not mention two gates in his 1854 letter and 1872 report. Although it is now impossible to know the precise reason, Elliot seems to have been confused about 19 Letter of Walter Elliot to the Chief Secretary of the Govermment, dated 23 November 1854, Board Collection, No. 172.608 (BL, OIOC, F/4/2648). Walter Elliot, "Archaeology in the Krishna District," The Indian Antiquary 1 (1872): 348; Sewell, Report on the Amaravati Tope, 68. 20 Elliot, "Archaeology in the Krishna District," 346-348. 21 Elliot's original sketches were found in Sewell's own copy of his 1877 excavation report. Sewell's hand copy of the Elliot sketches was also bound into this report (Knox, Amaravati, 18). A published letter from Elliot to Sewell mentions some rough sketches of the rail and the st?pa (Sewell, Report, 68); it is likely that those sketches are the ones now in the British Museum. 22 Elliot, " Archaeology in the Krishna District," 346 ; Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, 18 ; Knox, Amaravati, 27,227-229 ; Upin der Singh, "Amaravati: The Dismembering of the Mah?caitya," South Asian Studies 17 (2001): 23. However, Robert Sewell, who studied Elliot's sketches and notes, understood that Elliot excavated the north gate in addition to the west gate. He expressed his view in a letter to the government: From R. Sewell to Chief Secretary to Government, dated Greenwood, Ootakamund, 20 August 1881, Madras Public Proceeding, September 1881, no. 1199 (BL, OIOC, P/1746). Barrett, who must have studied Elliot's materials and Sewell's notes, comments that Elliot found some sculp tures at the north gate, although he basically thinks that Elliot excavated the southwest part of the mound (Barrett, Sculptures from Amaravati, 23 and n. 12). Barrett was also aware of Elliot's unpublished letter of 1854, which mentions his survey at the north gate (Board Collection, No. 172.608 [BL, OIOC, F/4/2648]). These remarks by Sewell and Barrett, however, were not pursued by subsequent studies. 23 See Sivaramamurti, Amaravati Sculptures, pi. 31.2. James Burgess, who surveyed the st?pa in 1881-82, also found this pillar at the north gate. James Burgess, Notes on the Amaravati St?pa, Archaeological Survey of Southern India (Madras : Government Press, 1882; rpt., Varanasi: Indological Book House, 1972), no. 164; Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, pi. u.3-4. 94</page><page sequence="7">his excavation areas as early as 1854, since in the letter ofthat year, a lion statue that Elliot apparently discovered at the west gate is described as having been discovered at the north gate.24 His 1872 report was written eighteen years later, by which time he had lost all his excavation documents except for a few sketches. Consequently, it is not surprising that he did not describe the details of the excavation with complete accuracy. The two Elliot sketches are precious documents depicting the west and north gates of the railing. From these sketches, can we work out what types of railings formed each gate? Focusing on the rail pillars depicted in the sketch of the west gate, we notice that no single pillar depicts a narrative relief (fig. 10).25 This is underpinned by Elliot's accompanying comment describing the pillars simply as "fluted" (see Appendix I). This leads us to assume that the west gate consisted of simple pillars with no narrative sculptures, i.e. first-phase railings (fig. 18). The north gate, unlike the west, had rail pillars filled with narrative sculptures according to Elliot's second sketch (fig. 11). Three of the rail pillars depicted are now in the Government Museum, Chen nai (fig. 12).l6 Elliot's notes on this sketch, which mention three rail copings and two rail pillars as well as one octagonal pillar (see Appendix II), help us identify five more components as having been located at the north gate (in the order described in Elliot's notes): (a) a coping at the Government Museum, Chennai27 (b) a coping at the British Museum (fig. 13)28 (c) a coping at the British Museum29 (d) a rail pillar at the Government Museum, Chennai30 (e) a rail pillar at the British Museum (fig. 4).31 In addition to these various pieces recorded by Elliot, we have one more north gate piece whose inscrip tion declares that it formed a part of the gate.32 The stylistic features of all these pieces are those of the second phase. The inescapable conclusion, therefore, is that the north gate belonged to the second phase, while the west gate belonged to the first phase. As before, the configuration is summarized in schematic form in Figure 18. 24 See Letter of Walter Elliot to the Chief Secretary of the Government, dated 23 November 1854, Board Collection, No. 172.608 (BL, OIOC, F/4/2648). 25 The sketch shows that the gate had small shrines containing Buddha statues and bodhisattva panels. These are obvi ously later additions dated to around the seventh and eighth centuries CE and thus do not concern us here (Knox, Amaravati, 227-229). On this later Amar?vat? sculpture, see Douglas Barrett, "The Later School of Amar?vat? and its Influences, Am and Letters 28.2 (1954): 41-53. 26 See Sivaramamurti, Amaravati Sculptures, pis. 31.1,32.1-2, and 37.1.

Unlike the earlier surveyors, he dili gently described each piece, recording their size and original location, and even had a few photographs taken of them.34 Apart from some small fragments, these pieces were reburied after the survey in order to preserve the site context; they were recovered in 1880 during J. G. Horsfall's excavation, and were surveyed by James Burgess in 1881-82. The twenty-eight railing pieces found in the northwest, which include nine rail pillars, eight cross bars, and eight copings, draw attention.35 Six small fragments were never photographed and are described so vaguely that they cannot be classified. Of the remaining twenty-two pieces, however, we can positively assign twelve to the first phase, nine to the second phase, and one to the third phase (fig. 14).36 Despite the existence of the latter piece - a fragment of coping - the rest of the pieces suggest that the northwest quadrant consisted of first- and second-phase pieces. Sewell's report also shows that the first-phase pieces, including parts of in situ rail pillars and crossbars, were clustered toward the western part (fig. 15).37 The second-phase pieces, on the other hand, were clustered toward the north ern part. This arrangement agrees with the configuration of the west and the north gates reconstructed through Elliot's records. As before, see Figure 18 for a schematic configuration of the railing. J. G. Horsfall's Excavation (1880) and Later Surveys Sewell had hoped to return to Amar?vat? to undertake a more extensive excavation of the st?pa. This hope was dashed, however, by Richard Grenville, Duke of Buckingham and Governor of Madras, who audaciously ordered the mound cleared and the work at Amar?vat? terminated. The officer who under took this order was not Sewell, but J. G. Horsfall, the Collector of the Kistna (Krishna) district. In February 1880, he started the clearance work and uncovered the entire passageway. Although this work turned up abundant archaeological materials, including coins, inscriptions, and sculptures, Horsfall did not record them properly and perhaps could not due to his lack of knowledge of the materials. Instead, he numbered the excavated areas and took panoramic photographs of the passageway to record the general configuration of the excavated sculptures (fig. 16).38 33 Sewell, Report on the Amaravati Tope, 31-59. 34 The photographs are now in the Department of Asia, the British Museum. 35 Sewell, Report on the Amaravati Tope, nos. 26-28, 31, 34, 37, 39-44, 46, 55, 59, 62, 64, 66, 69, 76-79, 80, 82-84, 86. 36 Ibid., nos. 26-28,31,34,37,40,44, 55,62, 69,76 (first phase); nos. 39,41,42,43,46,78,79,80,84 (second phase); no. 82 and Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, pi. 26-1 (third phase); nos. 59, 64, 66, jj, 83, and 86 (unidentified).

In this way, the limestone railing was almost com pletely removed from the site, except for fragmentary pieces. After Burgess's survey, Alexander Rea excavated further outside the west, east, and south gateways of the st?pa in 1888-89.40 Between 1905 and 1909, Rea extended the area of excavation to the immediate surroundings of the railing circle and on the north of the st?pa.41 After independence, the Archaeological Survey of India excavated the st?pa again in 1958-59 and 1973-75.42 Although these two excavations revealed some evidence for the ear liest phase of the st?pa, including components of a very early railing, to which I will return below, the campaign uncovered only a few pieces of sculpted limestone railing under study here. Because of the complete "clearance" of the st?pa by Horsfall, his excavation has been regarded as nothing short of a destruction of the site. However, the panoramic photographs, preserved at the British Museum and the British Library, are still useful for determining the general location of exca vated pieces ; the sculpture's stylistic features may be ascertained from the report by Burgess, who pub lished notes on each stone, and by the actual pieces preserved in the Government Museum, Chennai, and the Archaeological Museum, Amar?vat?.43 An examination of these data yields a conclusion of some significance: railing types were not in fact mixed up chaotically, but clustered in specific locations according to type (fig. 17). The first-phase railing was located in the southwest and northwest; the sec ond-phase railing occupied the northwest and northeast; and the third-phase railing occupied the south gate and the area immediately west of it. The southeast segment was empty because Mackenzie had already removed that portion of the railing in 1817. This survey of the early excavations thus produces a key finding : there was a consistency in the arrange ment of the three types of railing around the Amar?vat? st?pa. As shown in Figure 18, the first-phase Records. See a letter dated 12 June 1882 from H. H.

F. M. Asher and G. S. Gai (New Delhi: Oxford and IBH, 1985), 15-23. 43 A possible problem with these data is that Horsfall's team may have moved excavated pieces at will when they took the photographs. Horsfall himself, however, states that his work simply exposed the sculpture but did not disturb the original context of the site. See H. Cole, "Memorandum on the Present Condition of Amaravati Tope," India Home Proceedings, Archaeology 1881-82, 68 (BL, OIOC, P/1681). His statement is corroborated by the fact that the pieces surveyed and submerged by Sewell had been little moved when Burgess surveyed these pieces (Burgess, Notes on the Amaravati St?pa, 27-32). 97</page><page sequence="10">railing seems to have stood along the southwest and the west gate; the second-phase railing stood between the northwest and northeast including the north gate; and the third-phase railing stood along the southeast and south-southwest including the south gate. In short, the three phases of the railings were arranged chronologically in a clockwise fashion. This finding is further supported by two cir cumstantial clues. First, the arrangement of the railing shows that it was built in accord with the proper direction for circumambulating the st?pa. This is reasonable if we assume that the changes in railing sizes and sculptural styles resulted from a process of construction over time. Second, the sequence of work seems to have begun at the south gate, proceeded clockwise, and finished with a recon struction of the south gate. This accords with the archaeological evidence of the 1958-59 excavation, which found that the southern projection (?yaka) of the st?pa enshrined five crystal relic caskets (figs. 19 and 20).44 As with the main st?pa at S?nch?, the south gate may be designated the main gate. It will be clear from this analysis that the commencement and completion of the railing at the south gate shows the Amar?vat? railing was not a haphazard assemblage of miscellaneous pieces, but was an authentic project following an ordered plan. 3. Evidence of an Earlier Railing The interpretation presented above prompts some further questions. Because the three phases of the railing are quite different in terms of size and style, the work must have proceeded gradually over a substantial period of time. Why did the construction involve such a slow process ? Does this mean that there was no complete railing at Amar?vat? for a long time before the end of the third phase? To answer these questions, it is necessary to examine structures that existed before the building of the sculpted limestone railing. Excavations carried out in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries uncovered a good number of architectural components that can be linked to the early st?pa, although they have not been studied in detail.45 Archaeological evidence indicates that many of these early pieces were crushed into small fragments and re-used for the building materials of the later st?pa A6 Another example of this "recycling" work are the so-called "palimpsest" pieces, which have new sculptures on the back of earlier ones (figs. 21, 22). The early sculptures show distinctly flat modeling, shallow lin ear carving, and rigid postures (figs. 21, 23); accompanying inscriptions are characterized by angular shapes and straight-line strokes (fig. 24). These features are quite similar to those found on sculptures and inscriptions of the post-Mauryan period, as represented by the Bh?rhut railing (ca. 150-100 BCE ). A. Ghosh and I. K. Sarma have dated a few inscriptions on granite pillars at Amar?vat? to an even ear 44 See IAR (1958-59): 5 and pi. 2; Debala Mitra, Buddhist Monuments (Calcutta: Sahitya Samsad, 1971), photo 123.

The fragmentary and recycled features of early sculptures suggest that the early st?pa and its architectural components were substantially renovated when the later con struction work began. This later renovation work certainly included the replacement of an earlier railing, remnants of which were found by several excavators.48 According to my observations, this earlier railing, charac terized by plain decoration, can be broadly divided into three types based on the size and material of the components (Table III). The smallest one (type 3), which Rea's excavation in 1905?6 found out side the east and north gates, is perhaps disproportionately small to encircle the large st?pa49 and may have been used to decorate the entryways to the st?pa or to demarcate the entire monastic complex. The remaining two types (types 1 and 2) are larger in size and probably did surround the early st?pa. Type 1 consists of massive granite pillars about one meter wide and over two meters high (fig. 26).5? Rea's excavation found that these granite pillars were laid along the perimeter of the circumambula tory path near the east and west gates. Concerning the original position of these pillars, Rea commented that "it was perfectly evident that they had originally stood against the outside of the great marble [i.e. limestone] railing, forming another railing at a lower level."51 While excavations have not con firmed corresponding granite crossbars and copings, Burgess did find a number of plain limestone crossbars near the granite pillars (fig. 27) and affirmed that they fit into the mortise holes of the gran ite pillars.52 The type 2 railing, on the other hand, seems to have been made of limestone only; its rail pillars are narrower than the granite pillars, but their height definitely surpassed two meters, as seen in a nearly intact example found at the bottom of the southern ?yaka that enshrined the relic caskets (fig. 20). As the excavator of these limestone rail pillars has suggested, they seem to have stood on the northern and southern sides of the st?pa, and constituted part of a single railing together with the gran ite pillars, which stood on the western and eastern sides.53 This view is corroborated by the fact that the surviving limestone crossbars may fit into both the granite and the limestone uprights, according to my estimates of the size of the mortise holes on the limestone and granite pillars.54 As for the cop 47 Ghosh, "The Early Phase of the Stupa," nos. 1-3; Sarma, "Early Sculptures and Epigraphs," 17-18 and pis. 14-15. 48 Burgess, Notes on the Amaravati St?pa, 52 ; Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, 22 ; Rea, " Excavations at Amaravati," 119 ; Chanda, "Some Unpublished Amaravati Inscriptions," nos. 1, 3-20; Sarma, "Some More Inscriptions," nos. 74-76; Ghosh, "The Early Phase of the Stupa," nos. 1?37; Sarma, "More Prakrit Inscriptions," nos. 86?88; Sarma, "Early Sculptures and Epigraphs," 17-19. 49 Rea, "Excavations at Amaravati," 117 and pi. 46. 50 Burgess noted that all of the granite pillars had lost upper parts, but one of them was still over 71/2 feet (ca. 2.2 meters). See Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, 22. 51 Rea, "Excavations at Amaravati, 119. 52 Burgess, Notes on the Amaravati St?pa, 52; Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, ii; Sarma, "Some More Inscriptions," 62-63. 53 Sarma, "Some More Inscriptions," 63. 54 Sarma tries to differentiate crossbars fitting into granite pillars from those fitting into plain limestone pillars by their sizes and palaeography; ibid., 62-63, 66-67. According to my observations and measurements, however, such a dif ferentiation is not possible. 99</page><page sequence="12">ing that went with this earlier railing, early excavations revealed no conclusive evidence. Among the excavated pieces, however, there exist two types of coping that may have been components of the early railing: coping i is plain limestone with a post-Mauryan inscription (figs. 28, 29);55 coping 2 depict ing running youths and animals on one side in a Bh?rhut-like style (fig. 30). Since the earlier railing was completely replaced in later renovations, it is impossible to be precise as to its original configuration and dimensions. If we accept Rea's comment on the original position of the granite pillars, however, the earlier railing could have had the same dimensions as the fully sculpted limestone railing of later times. The magnificent size of this earlier railing, which must have reached about three meters in height, strengthens this assumption. Moreover, if we consider the exis tence of this earlier railing, the slow, three-phased construction of the later limestone railing becomes explicable: it was not an entirely new architectural project, but rather a gradual replacement of the earlier railing. PART II A CHRONOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION I. Early Studies and Recent Discoveries The foregoing section has shown that the sculpted limestone railing at Amar?vat? was constructed in three phases in different periods. This three-phase construction gradually replaced an earlier railing built in the post-Mauryan period (ca. 200-100 BCE ). This prompts another question: What dates can we assign to the three phases of "new" railing? As is well known, earlier studies on Amar?vat? have proposed a variety of answers to this question. C. Sivaramamurti, who published the first comprehensive study of the chronology in 1942, divided the construction into two periods. He dated the railing of the early period (which corresponds to the first-phase railing in our classification) to between ca. 200 and 100 BCE by comparison with Bh?rhut. The railing of the late period (equivalent to our second and third phases) he dated to ca. 150 CE, when the later S?tav?hanas ruled the Andhra region.56 Barrett subsequently opined that the entire railing, made in three phases, was built exclusively under the rule of the later S?tav?hanas. He thus dated its period of construction to between 125 and 240 CE ,57 Philippe Stern and Mireille B?nisti, who in 1961 attempted a chronological classification of various motifs in the Amar?vat? sculptures, compared the pieces which they labeled first period, including our first-phase railing, to the S?nch? I and III gate ways. The remaining pieces, divided into three periods, were assigned to the later S?tav?hana period 55 On this inscription, see Annual Report of Indian Epigraphy (1953-54): 21 (B-35); P. R.

On the other hand, the railings in the fully developed style ? the second and third phases ? have been universally deemed products of the later S?tav?hana period, commonly dated to the second and third centuries CE. However, recent work on the dynastic history of India requires that all these interpretations be completely set aside. The chronological framework has been changed by three key developments: (1) the redating of the later S?tav?hanas, (2) the discovery of the Sada dynasty of Andhra, and (3) the redating of the Kaniska era. The Later S?tav?hana Dynasty The first issue we need to consider is when the later S?tav?hana dynasty began. The traditional and most prevalent theory to date on this issue has been that proposed by E. J. Rapson and D. C. Sircar. They calculated the reign years of Gotam?puta S?takani, founder of the later S?tav?hanas, by estab lishing dates for Nahap?na, a famous ?aka-ksatrapa of the Ksahar?ta family and rival of Gotam?puta. Assuming that Nahap?na as a Saka-ksatrapa used the Saka era ( = 78 CE ), they assigned the end of his reign to 124 CE, since his last known year in dated inscriptions is 46 (78 + 46 = 124).6l They further pos tulated that this was the year when Nahap?na was defeated by Gotam?puta S?takani, and equated it with the latter's eighteenth regnal year, since an inscription of this year records a donation by Gotam?puta of land once owned by Usavad?ta, Nahap?na's son-in-law.62 Gotam?puta's accession may thus be dated to ca. 106 CE (124-18 = 106). Since Gotam?puta is known from epigraphic evidence to have reigned for twenty-four years, the end of his reign may be dated to 130 CE (106+24 = 130).63 Yet there is evidence contradicting this theory in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, whose compi lation is securely fixed to ca. 40-70 CE because of a reference in the text to Malichus, a datable king of the Nabataeans in northern Arabia. The Periplus, which describes ancient trade between India and the Mediterranean world, mentions a kingdom ruled by Mambanos around Barygaza (present-day Broach in Gujarat, western India). Scholars who have studied this text unanimously identify the ruler 58 Stern and B?nisti, ?volution du style, 71-76, 83-85. 59 Vidya Dehejia, "Early Activity at Amar?vat?," Archives of Asian Art 22 (1969-70): 48-53. 60 Knox, Amaravati, 34-39, 89. 61 Edward James Rapson, Coins of the Andhra Dynasty, the Western Ksatrapas, the Traik?taka Dynasty, and the i(Bodhi" Dynasty (London: The British Museum, 1908), xxvi-xxvii ; D.

Trabold and Vidya Dehejia have already noted this evidence and dated the reigns of Nahap?na and Gotam?puta to the mid- or late first century CE, although their opinions have not achieved wide acceptance in the chronology of S?tav?hana art and architecture.65 Recent numismatic studies, however, have now provided strong evidence to support and further elaborate the new dating described above. Nigel Seeley and Paula Turner's metallurgical study sug gests that the lead coins issued around the time of Gotam?puta and Pulum?yi may have been made from imported Roman lead.66 The lead isotope ratio in these coins closely matches those from Sar dinian and Spanish lead mines, which were superseded after the discovery of British lead mines around 50 CE. They also noticed that Nahap?na's silver coins show an exceptionally high silver content (98.16 per cent), and that they seem to have been minted from Roman denarius coins issued before Nero, who debased the silver coinage in 63 CE. During the reign of Casta?a, another powerful aaka-ksatrapa rul ing after Nahap?na, the purity of silver coins showed significant decline. Based on these findings, they suggest that the era of Nahap?na and Gotam?puta may be dated to around the mid-first century CE. This conclusion is corroborated by Joe Cribb's recent work. Cribb has convincingly argued that the use of the &amp;aka era seems to have originated during the reign of Casta?a, who ruled after Nahap?na.67 It is unlikely, therefore, that Nahap?na used the ?aka era. As evidence in support of this view, Cribb refers to some Nahap?na coins which were restruck by the Indo-Parthian king Sasan, the second successor of Gondophares, whose rule may be fixed between ca. 20 and 45 CE by ample numis matic and textual evidence. Cribb thus suggests that Nahap?na used the Gondophares era, which com menced around 20 CE. He then dates Nahap?na to the middle of the first century CE and Gotam?puta S?takani to ca. 48-71 CE. He further dates the subsequent S?tav?hana kings based on the known reg nal years of each ruler, and assumes the dynasty ended around the mid-second century CE. Cribb's main contentions have been further investigated in Shailendra Bhandare's doctoral thesis on S?tav?hana coinage.68 Bhandare accepts Cribb's main arguments that: (1) Casta?a was the founder 64 Wilfred H.

On the other hand, Bhandare does not admit the existence of the Gondophares era, but places the victory of Gotam?puta and the end of Nahap?na's reign to the same year as the accession of Casta?a. He thus assigns these events to the start of the Saka era (78 CE ) and dates Nahap?na to ca. 32-78 CE and Gotam?puta to ca. 60-85 CE ,69 He also suggests new dates for the reign of subsequent rulers, and places the end of the dynasty around the mid-third century CE 7? While these latest studies leave a few unsettled problems, such as the era used by Nahap?na and the ending date of the dynasty, they at least establish a convincing fixed point for the start-date of the later S?tav?hana dynasty based on numismatic evidence. This date, which corresponds well with the account in the Periplus, should now be assumed to be around the mid-first century CE rather than the early second century CE. The Sadas: A Local Dynasty before the Later S?tav?hanas The second consideration that changes the chronology of the Amar?vat? is the recent work on the political organization of the Krishna river valley. When Sivaramamurti and Barrett published their work, little was known about the political history of the Amar?vat? region in the early historic period apart from the rule of the S?tav?hanas. This lack of information led Barrett to state, "there was nei ther the social organisation nor the economic wealth to erect a series of monuments in Andhradesa" before the coming of the S?tav?hanas.71 Recent archaeological studies in Andhra, however, have effectively demolished this view, and revealed abundant evidence of numerous local dynasties in the post-Mauryan period.72 The Sadas were one such dynasty. Although a few coins and inscriptions bearing the name sada had been reported in early studies, the Sadas have long been identified as unknown S?tav?hana rulers.73 But numismatic evidence from recent excavations at Vaddam?nu, located some 10 kilometers away from Amar?vat?, has demonstrated an independent political status for the Sadas.74 These excavations revealed four peri ods at the site, ranging from the Mauryan to the Visnukundin, and yielded some 350 coins, including 69 Ibid., 168-178. 70 Ibid., 275-330. 71 Barrett, Sculptures from A maravati, 40. 72 See B.

The inscribed coins bear the names of three kings ending with the word sada and carry the legends: (i) rano siri maha sada, (2) rano siri sivamaka sada, and (3) [rano] siri asaka [or asoka] sada. The excavators concluded that the names on the coins refer to three kings of the Sada dynasty, and that these kings ruled the Amaravat? region before the coming of the S?tav?hanas.75 Schol ars have subsequently begun to re-examine numismatic and epigraphic data linked to the S?tav?hanas, and have confirmed more evidence of the Sadas, including two more Sada kings ? Siri Sada and Siva Sada ? in addition to the above three.76 Bhandare has also identified a coin in the British Museum as an issue of another Sada ruler named [Vija]ya Sada, although his historical existence is still obscure compared with the other kings.77 Particularly noteworthy for us is the Sada king Sivamaka Sada, whose name is recorded in an Amaravat? inscription on a second-phase rail coping (figs. 31, 32).78 Although scholars have been troubled by this name and tried to identify it with a S?tav?hana king ( V?sithiputa S?takani or Sivaskanda S?takani), it is now clear that it refers to a king of the Sada dynasty.79 The Kaniska Era The third and final issue that affects not only the dating of the Amaravat? railing, but the chronolog ical framework of all early Indian sculpture, is the proposed new dating for the inauguration of the Kaniska era (Kaniska I era). Although opinions ranging from 78 CE (the ?aka era) to 100-140 CE have long been popular, separate studies by Joe Cribb and Harry Falk have established the date of the era in a convincing way. A comprehensive consideration of the available numismatic, epigraphic, and tex tual evidence has led Cribb to argue that the beginning of the era can be placed between ca. 100 and 120 CE. Especially important in this dating is the newly discovered Rabatak inscription.80 Falk has refined the date even further using passages in the Yavanaj?taka that distinguish the Saka era from the Kaniska era. Falk demonstrated that this text describes specific astronomical events during the early centuries CE. Based on this, he has fixed the Kaniska II era to 227 CE and, following van Lohuizen, who set the era of Kaniska II at 100 years after that of Kaniska I, assigned the Kaniska I era to ca. 127 CE .8l The Cribb and Falk studies corroborate each other and show that the Kaniska I era started in ca. 127 CE. As a result, the theory that the ?aka and Kaniska eras are equated can be safely set aside. 75 Sastri, Bai, and Veerender, Vaddamanu, 164. 76 A. M.

The revised S?tav?hana chronology suggests that we should review the dating of Buddhist monuments containing inscriptions by Nahap?na, Gotam?puta, or Pulum?yi. The identification of the Sadas as local rulers indicates that the second-phase railing, long regarded as a specimen of the " high period " of Amar?vat?, was actually constructed under a dynasty that ruled the region before the S?tav?hanas. The new date for the beginning of the Kaniska I era, 127 CE, is a crucial breakthrough for dating the Kus?na sculptures, which have been compared to a number of the Amar?vat? pieces. In light of this new evidence, it is necessary to re-examine the chronological framework of the Amar?vat? railing. Here I pass over the earlier railing built in the post Mauryan period and focus on the later railing built in three phases, which completely replaced it. 2. DATES OF THE LIMESTONE RAILING The First-Phase Railing Among the three phases of railing construction, the most problematic to date is the first phase (fig. 3). As noted above, dates proposed in earlier studies have ranged from the second century BCE to the early second century CE. A significant clue as to the date of the railing is provided by the palaeography of the votive inscrip tions on the railing components. Despite the archaic appearance of the sculptures, the inscriptions on the rail pillars and crossbars of this first-phase railing show late features, such as head-marks on each stroke and curved vowel signs (figs. 33a, 33b). Similar advanced features can be observed in the cop ing inscriptions as well (fig. 33c).82 These features are unmistakably different from those observed in the early Amar?vat? inscriptions cut on the sculpture of the post-Mauryan phase, which, like the Bh?rhut inscriptions, have plain shapes with linear strokes (figs. 24,25,29). This clearly demonstrates that what we have termed first-phase railing is considerably later than the earliest Amar?vat? sculp tures, which belong to the post-Mauryan period (ca. 200-100BCE ). From a palaeographic standpoint the features observed in the first-phase railing, i.e. head-marks and curved vowel signs, do not appear in the Br?hm? script before the Sanch? I gateway inscriptions.83 This indicates that the first-phase rail ing should date to the time of the Sanch? I gateways or later. How much later, then, may the first-phase railing be than the Sanch? I gateways? Barrett, who tried to prove a chronological link between the first-phase railing and the rule of the later S?tav?hanas, compared the format of the first-phase pillars with a pilaster relief at N?sik cave 3, which is datable to 82 Dehejia has pointed out that two inscriptions on a first-phase rail pillar (III-i, III-2) show later pal?ographie features than do inscriptions on the first-phase coping (I-2,1-3). She thus assumes that the rail pillar inscriptions were inscribed about a half century later than the coping inscriptions (Dehejia, "Early Activity at Amaravat?," 51-52). It seems highly problematic to construct such a detailed chronology on paleography only. 83 Ahmed Hasan Dani, Indian Palaeography (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), 52-53; Richard Salomon, Indian Epigraphy (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 31-34. 129</page><page sequence="42">the later S?tav?hana period (fig. 34).84 This comparison was adopted by Knox as well.85 As they admit ted, however, this comparison yielded no conclusions as to whether the Amaravat? rail pillar pre-dated or post-dated the N?sik pilaster. Indeed, the simple design of the rail pillar can be observed in much earlier rail pillars, such as those at Bh?rhut and at Sanch? II (fig. 35). Perhaps a more appropriate way of determining the date of this railing lies in examining the relief sculptures on the rail copings, which show agarland supported by dwarves (fig. 36). These coping sculp tures are characterized by their shallow carving, which is certainly different from that on the second phase railing. As Sivaramamurti and Knox have noted, the style at first glance looks similar to Bh?rhut and the earliest group of Amaravat? sculptures. However, the fine details of these carvings show dis tinctly advanced stylistic features. A good example is a relief stone at Chennai featuring a seated female and dwarves (figs. 36,37). While the female figure's shallow carving and almond-shaped eyes may look archaic, her body is well-proportioned and her sitting posture reasonably natural. The carving on the accompanying dwarves is also shallow, but ably depicts soft flesh and flexible body movement. These figures are unmistakably different from the earliest Amaravat? sculptures such as those on an early drum slab at the British Museum (fig. 21), in which the male figures have awkward staccato poses and dispro portionately large hands and faces. The closest parallel to the natural modeling and movement of the first-phase coping, although outside Andhra, is found at the south torana at Sanch? st?pa I. This obser vation is corroborated by Stern and B?nisti, who find iconographie similarities between the motifs on the first-phase railing and those on Sanch? I toranas.*6 Kaoru Nagata's recent study, which points out the sim ilarities between the vine scrolls of Sanch? I and the first-phase rail copings, supports this view as well.87 In light of the above observations, therefore, the first-phase railing at Amaravat? may be placed with good reason to around the time of the Sanch? I gateways. But is it possible to be more precise? Although a Sanch? gateway inscription mentions an early S?tav?hana ruler named S?takani, there are several opinions about his reign dates, ranging from the second century BCE to the early first century CE. Accordingly, there are several proposed dates for the gateways: (1) ca. the second century BCE,88 (2) ca. the mid-first century BCE,89 and (3) ca. the beginning of the first century CE.9? Although the first proposal is hardly believable if the advanced features of the gateway sculpture are considered, it is difficult to verify either of the remaining two opinions at our present state of knowledge. It is nev ertheless unlikely that the first-phase railing can be dated much later than the beginning of the Chris 84 Barrett, Sculptures from Amaravati, 45. 85 Knox, Amaravati, 34-35. 86 Stern and B?nisti, ?volution du style, 50, 56, 73. 87 Nagata Kaoru, "Minami indo no renge tsurukusa ni kansuru ichi kosatu ?

As an interim date, therefore, we should assign the first-phase railing to between ca. 50 BCE and the beginning of the common era. The Second-Phase Railing Concerning the date of the second-phase railing (figs. 4, 39), the reign of Sivamaka Sada, whose name is recorded in a coping inscription of this phase, is an important clue. Although the detailed dynastic history of the Sadas is not yet known, recent studies agree that Sivamaka Sada was probably the last of the line, since a type of coin issued by V?sithiputa Siri Pulum?yi, the first S?tav?hana ruler in this region, is the direct successor of Sivamaka's issues.91 If we follow the most recent chronology of the later S?tav?hanas and date Pulum?yi to around the late first century CE, the reign of Sivamaka should be placed around the same time or a little earlier. Accordingly, the date of the second-phase railing could be posited to fall in the mid- to late first century CE. Our concern now is to determine if this dating, which assigns the second-phase railing to about a half century earlier than prevailing chronologies, fits other evidence. Particularly important in this regard are the stylistic and iconographie features of the sculptures that earlier studies have regarded as crucial for dating. In these chronological studies, the second phase has been compared to the following dated or datable corpora of material: (1) rock-cut sculptures at N?sik and K?rl? in the western Deccan (figs. 40, 41), and (2) Kus?na sculptures in Mathur? dated around the reign of Kaniska and Huviska (fig. 42).92 According to the new chronology for the later S?tav?hanas, K?rl? and N?sik, which contain Gotam?puta and Nahap?na inscriptions, are now dated to the mid- and late first century CE ,93 The syn chronism between K?rl? and the second-phase railing is thus tenable in our chronology. For Kus?na sculptures at Mathur?, however, the synchronism theory does not hold, since the Kaniska era is now known to have started in 127 CE rather than 78 CE. In short, the second-phase railing of Amaravat? can be dated close to K?rl? and N?sik, but should be placed earlier than the Kus?na sculptures at Mathur?. In my opinion, stylistic and iconographie features in the second-phase railing sculptures support this chronological proposal. Stylistically, all of the foregoing sculptures basically show fully developed features with well-rounded and sturdy bodies (fig. 39). Iconographically, however, the sculptures of the second-phase railing and those at K?rl? and N?sik (figs. 40, 41) differ from those of Mathur? (fig. 42) in that they never represent the Buddha in anthropomorphic form; in contrast, Buddha images were fully established in the Kus?na sculptures at Mathur?. Although this might reflect the conser vative nature of Buddhist practices in the Deccan, it is more probable that the Deccan sites actually pre-date Kus?na Mathur? sculptures. 91 Prasad, "Sada Coins," 57; Prasad, "Pre-S?tav?hana Phase," 337; Bhandare "Historical Analysis," 290. The S?tav?hanas' victory over the Sadas is corroborated by the fact that Pulum?yi's successor, V?sithiputa Siri S?takani, counterstruck the Sada coins, including Sivamaka's issue, with the nandipada (or triratna) symbol; Prasad, "Sada Coins," 57; Prasad, "Pre-S?tav?hana Phase," 337. 92 Stern and B?nisti, ?volution du style, 87; Sivaramamurti, Amaravati Sculptures, 34-43 ; Spink, "On the Development," 99. Barrett argues that the style of the K?rl? sculptures is comparable to the early phase of Amar?vat? which, in his chronology, is dated to the early second century CE; Barrett, Sculptures from Amaravati, 54-55. 93 Willis, "Early Indian Sculpture," 61-62. 131</page><page sequence="44">A second iconographie difference can be seen in the shapes of the male headdresses. Stern and B?nisti have pointed out, as has Sadakane in a more recent study, that the shape of the male headdress in early historic sculpture has evolved consistently. The earliest type, observed in the Bh?rhut railing and the Sanch? I toranas, wraps the big hair knot with a broad cloth (fig. 43a). The male headdress seen in a mithuna couple at K?rl? caitya retain some features of this early type, but the hair knot is smaller (fig. 43b). In the second-phase railing at Amar?vat?, we observe a headdress similar to the one at K?rl? (fig. 43c), but also a new type with a round frill surrounding a small hair knot (fig. 43d). A similar headdress is observed in guardian figures at the entrance of N?sik cave 3 (fig. 43e) (though these figures may have been added after the original vih?ra was completed by Gotam?puta).94 Finally, in Kus?na sculpture at Mathur?, this new type becomes the standard (fig. 43f)-95 the frill surrounding the hair knot is more elaborate than those at Amar?vat? and N?sik and is now pointed, a shape seen in the third phase Amar?vat? railing and in N?garjunakonda sculptures (fig. 43g). This evolution suggests that the second-phase railing can with good reason be dated later than the K?rl? mithuna but earlier than the early Kus?na sculpture at Mathur?. As mentioned above, the date of the K?rl? caitya is now fixed to the mid-first century CE because of a long inscription by Usavad?ta (a son-in-law of Nahap?na), which records a land grant to the monks at K?rl?.96 The second-phase railing at Amar?vat?, accom modated between K?rl? and Mathur?, may thus be dated to between ca. 50 and 100 CE. The Third-Phase Railing Finally, for the dating of the third phase (figs. 5, 8, 9), one of the most important clues, although it is not a railing piece, is provided by a dome slab whose inscription mentions Siri Ya?a S?takani (fig. 44).97 This slab is one of two types at Amar?vat?, and its stylistic and iconographie features are largely akin to the second phase, although it exhibits some later features. Stylistically, for example, the sculp ture retains the sturdy bodies of the second phase, while the rather dramatic poses of the flying figures anticipate the third phase. In terms of iconography, most of the slabs of this type still represent the presence of the Buddha with various symbols such as thrones, footprints, trees, and st?pas (fig. 45), with three exceptions (fig. 4o).98 In the third-phase railing, on the other hand, the style of the sculp ture is distinctly different from this dome slab, and shows considerable similarity to the N?garju nakonda sculptures of the Iksv?ku period (ca. 225-300 CE). Buddha images, including narrative scenes, become an established convention throughout this last phase. This suggests that the third 94 These guardians are fitted awkwardly into narrow spaces between the central doorway to the hall and two windows of the vih?ra\ parts of the sculptures thus intrude unnaturally into the space below the windows. This seems to sug gest that these figures had not been planned when the doorway and windows were completed during the reign of Gotam?puta. It is more likely that they were added in the time of Pulum?yi or even later. Willis's dating of these figures to the reign of Gotam?puta thus needs to be revisited; Willis, "Early Indian Sculpture," 61. 95 Stern and B?nisti, ?volution du style, 52-54; Sadakane Keiji, " Ajant? dai 9 kutsu dai 10 kutsu hekiga ? seisaku nendai no mondai wo ch?sin ni" (A study of the wall paintings in caves 9 and 10 at Ajanta: With special reference to their chronological problems), The T?h?

Our problem now is that the latest chronologies of the later S?tav?hanas presented by Cribb and Bhandare propose considerably different dates for Siri Ya?a S?takani - ca. 106-132 CE and ca. 170-200 CE respectively. We thus need to look elsewhere for a more exact date for the third phase. Such a clue to the dating of the third-phase railing can be found in the iconographie features of the Buddha images. Every Buddha image at Amar?vat?, without exception, has hair composed of snail-shell curls (fig. 47). It is well known that this distinctive hairstyle did not appear in the early Buddha images of Gandh?ra and Mathur?. Notably in Mathur?, the appearance of the hairstyle can be traced rather clearly by a series of dated images. These images show that the earliest sculptures consistently represented the hair like a tight cap, with an additional top-knot. This so-called kapardin type did not change until the seated Buddha from Anyor (year 51 of the Kaniska era), which depicts rows of semi-circles in the hair (fig. 48). The earliest dated image with hair in the form of snail-shell curls is a seated Jina dated year 12 of the Kaniska II era.99 If we follow Falk's dating for the inauguration of the Kus?na era, the Anyor Buddha should be dated to ca. 178 CE and the Jina, the first Mathur? image with snail-shell curls, to ca. 239 CE. If we concede that the snail-shell curls were adopted in Buddha images between these two dated sculptures, then it seems reasonable to assume that this hairstyle appeared about 200 CE. While this does not necessarily mean that the Buddha images at Amar?vat? adopted the hairstyle directly from Mathur?, it is hard to believe that the hairstyle was invented independently for the Amar?vat? Buddhas much before the Mathur?. If this logic is correct, the third-phase railing, which features such Buddha hairstyles, cannot be dated much before ca. 200 CE. This art-historical evidence supports the dating of Siri Ya?a S?takani proposed by Bandhare (ca. 170-200 CE ). If we followed Cribb's dates (ca. 106?132 CE ), we would have to accept that Amar?vat? sculptors produced Buddha images with hair in snail-shell curls at least seventy years before Mathur?. This seems unlikely in our view. Having established a plausible starting date for the third-phase railing, our final question is: How much later in time can the railing be placed after 200 CE ? As mentioned above, the dome slabs carved in Siri Ya?a's time (ca. 170-200 CE ) largely retain the stylistic and iconographie features of the sec ond-phase railing. The features of the third-phase railing, on the other hand, are clearly different from those of the dome slabs, and show a greater affinity to the N?g?rjunakonda sculptures. Considering these late stylistic features, the date of the railing may be extended to as late as the early Iksv?ku period (ca. 250CE). 99 E.

This long and gradual construction process supports the view that the railing was built to replace an earlier railing surrounding the st?pa, dated to the post-Mauryan period. As is well known, early Buddhist st?pas in the Indian subcontinent were constructed and refurbished repeatedly. The addition of architectural layers continued as long as there were donors, since the main purpose of building a st?pa was to provide donors with religious merit through the construction work, rather than to complete the monument as a balanced piece of architecture. The inconsistent configuration of the Amaravat? limestone railing may look rather odd to our modern eyes, but it is an intriguing example of the Buddhist manner of construction in the early historic period. Our new chronology for the Amaravat? railing has significant implications for our historical under standing of the st?pa. Scholars to date have assumed that the construction work flourished under the rule of the powerful S?tav?hanas. According to our revised chronology, however, the first and second phases of the railing were undertaken in the pre-S?tav?hana period. The third phase seems to have started in the declining years of the S?tav?hanas, and may have continued into the Iksv?ku period. The strong if unexpressed assumption in earlier studies is that the imperial dynasty played a decisive role in the st?pas construction. This cannot be considered accurate when set against the art-historical and archaeological analysis provided by the st?pa itself. For a better understanding of the historical cir cumstances surrounding the st?pa, perhaps we should explore socio-political and socio-economic devel opments of the lower Krishna valley during the early historic period, and the links between these developments and the monumental remains. These issues, however, will be reserved for a future study. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Many friends and colleagues helped me complete this article.

On penetrating some distance, &amp; taking out sculptured stones, a lion and a wall of sculptured stones was observed running East and West for a distance of 11.4 feet but the true wall only extended 8.2, the remainder 3.2 being added at some later period to form a small chapel abt [about] to be [ ?] mentioned. At the distance 8 feet 2 the wall turned to the North, &amp; again as the excavation proceeded, after proceeding in a North direction, it again turning to the E. The first consisted of 3 stones all [?] high and broad. The 2 first were sculptured with large lotus or circles, the outer [ ?] one having 2 half ones. The next one in two pieces each a whole lotus. In front of this stood a figure of a priest with a nimbus and a plain simple drapery.1 On the 3rd stone is the inscription no. 1. The corner stone turns to the N. has a grooved edge as if another had formerly fitted on to [?] it instead of the inscription stone. The continuation beyond the original for a space of 3.2 as above stated consists of 2 stones, one richly sculptured with man on horse back and Centaurs facing outwards [ ?], the centre being a sort of column of alternate bounded of fluting and 4 lions.2 The next stone is a rounded coping stone bearing an inscription (not copd [copied]). Passing round to the N. wall two chapels are found. The first contains 3 of the upright lotus stones in front of which are, first 3 figures mutilated &amp; evidently placed there at a more recent period,3 then another priest with nimbus &amp; red painted robe in front of the most N. of the 3 figures. The next chapel is a corner one half in the N and half in the E wall. The idol was a beautifully sculptured Buddhist god, but had been thrown on his face &amp; was utterly demolished.4 Behind the lotus stone is Insc. No. 2. The lotus stones on the N. wall side are all [?] gone, but there are 2 on the E side &amp; the line on this side is complete as far as five. But the idol and the cross stones are recent additions and are evidently stones from the ruins of the same edifice. On one forming E-side chapel wall of Dhami Deva5 is an inscrip tion in Nagari No. 3. On the lotus stone behind Dhami Deva is the inscription no. 4. Outside to [?] &amp; of Dhami Deva is a small figure holding a lotus6 &amp; then in front of the last lotus stone is a brick pedestal seemingly for a statue. Beyond this is a small sitting deity on a square stone.7 On this last lotus stone is an inscription no. 5. All these lotus stones are fluted or rather have 2 rounded ridges &amp; 3 hollows between them.8 The lotus and lion seem to be the characteristics of the order [?]. i This sculpture, probably a Buddha, is not depicted on the drawing and remains unidentified. 2 This is an unidentified drum pilaster; cf.
