"VERIFICATION" OF STATEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY (1) In contradistinction to mathematics, physics and biology, psychology and psychiatry deal to a large extent with the verbal behaviour of their objects. They are faced with two kinds of "sense"-problems: those with which the observer has to do in his theory-construction, and those which are characteristic of the verbal behaviour of his subjects. (2) Apart from a schematic and simplified usage, as it occurs in filling-up exer cises and other laboratory verbal behaviour, the psychologist has to do with statements the sense of which, on the one hand, is determined by the usage of his subjects and, on the other hand, so far as his records and theory are concerned, by his own language-sense. (3) This situation may give rise, and often gives rise, to all kinds of verbal con fusions. If we call object-language the language used in verbal behaviour of people which psychology investigates and meta-language the language psychology uses in its discourse about the verbal behaviour of people, it becomes obvious that in present-day psychology the two languages are inextricably mixed together. The language of the subject is I-language, that of the observer, in relation to the subject, is he-language. Both, investigators and investigated, often use terms without "referents" or with only verbal associations. There can be a great "dispersion" between the "sense" of state ments used by the subject and that of statements used by the observer. (4) The use of "physical language" is not a remedy against a confusing termino logy. One can tell highly speculative stories in physical language. The empirical verification of statements used by the investigator would require naming the concrete operations involved in testing them. (5) "Objective", in the sense of a class of responses yielding maximum reliability coefficients within or between individuals facing a common observational situation or situational element, refers to a criterion to which the protocol of the tester is subjected. An investigation into the way in which subjects verify their, often mainly emotive, statements requires other means (e.g. looking at the way in which they justify their behaviour or trying to break through the chain of their verbal associations (circular reasonings)). 369</page><page sequence="2">D. VUYSJE (1) "Verification" constitutes the nucleus of the theories of meaning developed in all forms of empirism. "Two propositions have the same meaning if they obtain the same verification, as true or false, for all possible observation", is a well-known for mulation occurring in modern empiricism, according to which not a separate concept, but only statements have a "sense". And this sense is determined by the way in which it can be verified. "Der Sinn eines Satzes is der Weg seiner Verifizierung", said Moritz Schlick. In empiristic circles the concept of verification is connected to the criterion of "truth". In his "Raum und Zeit in der gegenw?rtigen Physik" Schlick writes: "Every theory is composed of a network of conceptions and judgments, and is correct or true if the system of judgments indicates the world of facts uniquely". And Hans Rei chenbach, in his "Axiomatik der relativistischen Raum-Zeit-Lehre", has stressed that geometry as an empirical science must contain, besides the geometric axioms (relations among geometric concepts), the description of a method whereby the straightness of a line can be tested experimentally. As the axioms of geometry and the description of measurements form a net, we can regard the whole theory as a prescription for coordinating the abstract concepts of geometry with observational facts. In this sense, Reichenbach regards geometry as a system of "axioms of coordination". His criterion of truth is then similar to Schlick 's, namely, that the axioms of coordination should be unique. Other empiricists, like Von Mises, however, have pointed out that this criterion does not hold for statements characteristic of ethics (e.g. 'This statesman has a good character', because the exact signifi cation of good' and 'character' is not defined), nor for the so-called Allaussagen, statements of a general nature, which, accord ing to Popper, can only be falsified. It does not hold for com mands and questions neither! In this case we may ask, like Von Mises does, whether the statements are 'compatible with' a group of grammatical rules ('Verbindbarkeit'), but it is obvious that this new criterion refers to the more logical aspects of the 'sense-prob lem*. Neurath regarded Von Mises' term 'compatible with' to be too cumbersome and spoke (in his" Foundations of the Social Sciences") of 'isolated sentences'; these are sentences which can only be connected with a few other sentences. In psychology these criteria fail, because the observer ?when investigating the verbal behaviour of his subjects ? has only in part to do with observational statements, whereas the introspective statements cannot, or can only to a small extent, be investigated by 370</page><page sequence="3">"VERIFICATION" OF STATEMENTS IN PSYCHIATRY methods taken from physics and logic. The psychological 'sense problem' lies on another linguistic level than that of logic and physics. (2) With regard to point 2 I may observe that, so far as the criterion of verification is concerned, there is a great difference in the way in which statements occurring in the field of psychology are verified. The observer of the behaviour of the subjects is also the observer of their verbal behaviour. His analytic definitions are founded on the ex Prospective observation of the to a great extent verbal behaviour of these subjects, whereas, when constructing a theory or making a record his definitions (synthetic definitions) and descriptions are anchored in his introspective observation, his own language-sense, his own nets of association. These two proce dures, if not distinguished, may lead to all kinds of arbitrary inter pretations, resulting from the entangling of the nets of associa tion of the observer and the subject. (3) More often than not, the spontaneous usage of the subjects is a mixture of introspective and physical language and of object language and meta-language. Subjects often speak about the verbal behaviour of others, they often use terms of the meta-language together with those of the object-language. The psychological meta language (i.e. the language of the observer dealing with the lan guage of the subject) thus becomes a meta-meta-language, and so on. Moreover, the observer speaks about the mental phenomena of his subjects. In his protocols his introspective language deals with the introspective language of his subjects. He often interprets the meaning of their statements without submitting his interpretations to the latter. His own vernacular terms often refer to highly com plicated referents. Terms like emotion, volition, experience, intel ligence, thought, etc. are schematic abbreviations of processes which can be more usefully described by a micro-psychological termino logy referring and adapted to micro-situational elements. (4) The problems of physics concern the simplest relations be tween events. The problems of other sciences are, in comparison with those of physics, more intricate. In psychology, statements occur which play no part in physics as such, viz. those which find their origin in introspection (in the narrower sense of the word). Occult writings show that one can avail himself of phy siological, physical and logical terms which do not refer to physical situations or formation rules. The introduction of operational definitions, i.e. of statements which have meaning only by virtue of the concrete operations that enter into the definitions of the con 371</page><page sequence="4">D. VUYSJE cepts employed, should be performed carefully. In accordance with Bridgman's conception, equivalence of operations should be establish ed by empirical correlation of results rather than on deductive grounds. (5) It is obvious that the criterion of objectivity, as described in thesis 5, refers only to the protocols of the observer, to their test reliability. This reliability should be rooted in repeated application of the test to a sample of individuals. This procedure holds for all kinds of observational situations composed of observable elements, including observations of the verbal behaviour of subjects. Another question is: how do the subjects themselves verify their statements, in other words, how do they argue their statements: do they refer to situational elements, to justification of their behaviour, or to pure verbalisms? Particularly in the latter case, characteristic of the occurrence of circular reasonings, the introduction of an analy tical gradation, that is to say a classification of the acts of communi cation based on the number and the nature of indications and opera tions may give the observer an insight into structure of the verbal behaviour under examination. Such a gradation, or levelling of language, varying from purely subjective (introspective) state ments to intersubjective (physical) statements, may show him the way of tracing out more or less the boundaries of the "convey ability of meaning" and allow him, where possible, to induce the subject to translate his statements of a more speculative level into those of a more indicative or operational level, a procedure by which the communicability will be served. In this way, I think, analytic signifies can contribute to solving one of the main pro blems of interviewing the psychologist is confronted with in his everyday practice. 372</page><page sequence="5">P. H. ESSER Bennebroek, Netherlands B. "VERIFICATION" OF STATEMENTS IN PSYCHIATRY (1) It remains to be seen if in the field of Psychiatry just as in that of Psycholo gy the verbal output of a subject can be submitted to verification. Many statements of a highly emotional character being merely symptoms of certain dispositions have no direct communicative sense at all. (2) It being one of the characteristics of the mentally ill to loose contact and ex change of ideas with other people, the question naturally suggests itself if this symptom may be at the bottom of the phenomenon of these persons taking refuge in logical and ideological terminologies, their talk being a kind of verbal autism. (3) The expression "verbal autism" is used here for statements on a purely sub jective level. This kind of statements prevailing with mental patients, the "conversation" between observer and subject tends to the monologue. (4) Here we can find too that statements of a purely subjective nature appear as indicative ones. Even physical and logical terms applied by the subject during the sittings do not have any physical or logical reference. This characteristic of the subject often baffles the observer. So confusion of verbal levels occurs frequently. (5) The introduction of a psychological term like "verstehen" does not solve the problem under consideration, but renders the mystery only the better camouflaged. As Vuysje pointed out alreadly both Psychology and Psychiatry deal to a large extent with the verbal behavior of the persons under observation. We are confronted here he said, with two kinds of sense-problems; those with which the observer has to do when he wants to give an interpretation of the verbal behavior observed, and those which are charicteristic of the verbal behavior of his subjects under observation. 373</page><page sequence="6">P. H. ESSER These problems ask for ways and means to verify statements. In Psychology this can be done by urging the subject to apply his saying to a concrte situation. When we take e.g. his saying "this wine is good" under consideration, it is not clear by his words what he had in mind when saying this. It is no use trying to give satisfactory account of good in the abstract, nor is it necessary to be led astray by elaborating in opposition to physics a different science trying to explain the quid proprium of sensation as has been done in the past. What we have to do is try to verify that statement. We can ask for a definition of "good" in this particular context. Perhaps it turns out that he who called this particular wine good did like its sweetness, its taste. But it is also possible that he did go by the label and that we can let him drink an ordinary claret With no particular flavor for a Burgundy of high quality. When we find by experience that our man calls every wine with a sweet taste "good", we can predict what wine he will call "good" in the future. The observer must be able to separate his own feelings and associations, aroused in him in connection with the observed verbal behavior, from the meaning his subject gives to his words. We find however that in a report about what has been said by his subject, the observer often mixes up the descriptive part and the interpretative part. Apart from this it is obvious that no verbal behavior can ever be completely "analyzed". The symbols used here are meaningful only in terms of the individual experiences on the one hand and in terms characteristic of the interpretations of the observer on the other hand. One must bear in mind both in Psychology and Psychiatry, that these symbol-meanings are continually being both expressed in, and modified by the individual's current motivations, attitudes and environmental adaptations ? a corollary that cannot be neglected in evaluating the verbal communications of the sub ject in relation to his total behavior. In Psychiatry another difficulty arises. We find here a withdrawal from "external contacts". When a patient interprets the environ ment as frustrating and hostile he begins to withdraw. This with drawal can take the form of a depression, a suspicion, a lack of interest, a guilt-ridden ascetism, a dreamy over-idealism, paranoid delusions and so on. Sometimes we find here especially during initial stages of the illness a preference for idle philosophical reasoning, which tend 374</page><page sequence="7">"VERIFICATION" OF STATEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY ency did perhaps write down Janet the following sentence: "Quand on a vu beaucoup de scrupuleux, on en arrive ? se demander avec tristesse si la sp?culation philosophique n'est pas une maladie de l'esprit". The break with the environment not always leads to uninhibited regressive and primitive speech like name calling, but also to a flight into logical and ideological reasoning, which flight has however no less autistic character. We get the impression, that a lot of what patientstell the doctor has no direct communicative sense at all. The verbal behavior suggests a communication however and an invitation to join in a discussion. But during the sitting it becomes clear that the patient does not listen to what the observer is saying in answer to his reasoning but that he talks and talks, until the pseudo-discussion ends in a monologue. Especially when a formalistic tendency prevails the observer can be led astray by the verbal behavior of his patient, the statements of the latter, of a purely subjective nature, appearing as being in dicative. When someone talks e.g. the language of physics without reference to certain physical phenomena this verbal behavior in connection with other phenomena can be characteristic of certain mental disorders. In Psychology one assumes that the sayings of a subject have a communicative sense. In Psychiatry we must reckon with the pos sibility that the verbal behavior of a patient is autistic, his words being merely symptoms of certain dispositions. As there is often no real communication, it is impossible to know, if we have sim ilar associations as the patient, when hearing him talk. But that does not matter very much. The "content" of what a patient is saying is often only of secondary importance. What we want to know is if there are certain "formal charac teristics' ' in the way the patient speaks. And then we find with several patients a strong tendency to speak persistently in generaliza tions, or a tendency to ask endless questions (Gr?belsucht), which talking and asking seem to be of a compulsive nature. This talk ing is like a haunting melody that is hummed incessantly until it is interrupted by eating or sleep. His purely subjective utterances are, at least for the greater part, not verifiable at all. When we ask him to explain a term used by him, he proves himself to be unable to give a definition or to indicate what is meant. Sometimes he not even tries to give the ghost of an argu ment, sometimes he employs in arguing the same word in two or more senses. His word-word associations prove to give rise to all kinds of circular arguments, but do not result in any indication 375</page><page sequence="8">P. H. ESSER whatever. Can it be, that he shrinks back "into himself" because he is not able to face the stern requirements of practical life? Does he seek help from philosophy and formalism for the same reason? This question seems to be important from a signifie point of view. Some German Philosophers, e.g. Dilthey and Jaspers thought that they could help to answer such questions by introducing the term "verstehen" in Psychology and Psychiatry, which term they opposed to the term "erkl?ren". Insight into physical phenomena they called "erkl?ren". Insight into human behavior they called "ver stehen". It was presumed by these authors that in Physics we have to do with predictable events. In Psychology however we never should have such a thing like a predictable sequence of events. Psychiatrists will illustrate this hypothesis by saying that people who have been deceived can become depressed. But that is not necessary. Sometimes it will be observed that the deceived becomes suspicious, or even furious. According to these authors these reac tions can not be predicted, but nevertheless they can be "verstan den". We should prefer to call a sequence of events both in Physics and in Psychiatry only "verstanden" or "erkl?rt" when it has ren dered itself predictable, or when the verbal behavior which expres ses this events has been verified. Apart from this the term "verstehen" has been applied with considerable latitude of meaning. So it has been used as a synonym of "Einf?hlen", or as a vague term expressing the numerous ways by which people experience life. Sometimes people indicate with the term the function of apprehending connections which cannot be perceived, but must be conceived. In science a statement must be verifiable either by observation or by logical reasoning to make sense. Observation states a certain sequence of events. When under more or less the same circumstances this sequence is found over and over again we can predict it in the future. Certain psychiatrists want here to speak of "kausal erkl?ren", because from this sequence of events people feel justified in inferring their causal connection. This causal concept gives expression to the implicit faith in the connection of events. But the alleged causal neces sity in the sequence of so-called causes and effects, which "erkl?rt" things, seems to be just the "hypostasis" or "projection" of this belief. As the aim of Signifies is to investigate "meanings", it makes a syste matic study of signs and symbols used in a concrete situation. As such it studies not only words but also volitional elements and "semantic 376</page><page sequence="9">"VERIFICATION" OF STATEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY reactions", representing values to a given person in a given situation. Science tends in its progress to draw further and further away from anthropomorphism, common sense imposes on us. It aims at a more rational attitude towards the phenomena. We try to penetrate the phenomena with the conviction that they should prove themselves everywhere penetrable. Still in prac tice the ph?nom?ne appear to be not completely so. To master things we tend to take refuge to certain irrational elements, often forgetting that the idea of necessary connection is an a priori conception, in which observation of empirical data takes no part. With the growth of rational knowledge anthropomorphic elements like "genetisch verstehen" and "kausal erkl?ren" should however gradually be eliminated in the interpretation of observed psycholo gical or physical phenomena. 377</page></plain_text>
