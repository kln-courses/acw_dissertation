<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY "A GREAT WAVE AGAINST THE STREAM": WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES JONATHAN FENNO Abstract. This article investigates the figurative role of water in martial similes, metaphors, and personifications in the Iliad. Such imagery, it is argued, is generally informed by a thematic association of Greeks and their camp with the sea, and Trojans and their territory with rivers; as heroes sound and move like waves and streams, bodies of water become sympathetically animated warriors, and gods of sea and river rush into battle. The conclusion is that an ancient antithesis between saltwater and freshwater lends the Iliad a sense of unity in setting and plot and endows heroic action with greater cosmic and theological significance. Homer earns high praise from Aristotle for frequently endow- ing inanimate things with life, for imparting movement and life to every- thing (Rh. 1411b31-12al0). As examples of vividly energetic metaphors, the philosopher cites a "shameless" stone and "eager" spear-points, and to illustrate such animation in a simile, he quotes a line in which waves advance rank upon rank like soldiers (npb uiv t' aXk\ ocuxocp kn ocMux, //. 13.799). Whereas the personified weapons cited by Aristotle have under- standably attracted the attention of Homeric scholars,1 the figurative role of water in martial similes, metaphors, and personifications has not been thoroughly investigated. Accordingly, this article will focus on water 1 For example, Stanford 1936, 138-39, and Moulton 1979, 288-89, and n. 34, who comments on Aristotle's special admiration for "vivid personifications of the battle narra? tive" and argues that metaphorical personification of weapons should be "viewed as part of a system" of related images within the Iliad (Moulton focuses on the figurative "appetites" of spears and warriors).

I shall argue that such water imagery in the Iliad, what might be called hydropolemic imagery, is generally informed by a thematic association of Greeks and their camp with the sea and Trojans and their territory with rivers.2 I take as my point of departure Cedric Whitman's insightful study of the imagery of natural elements such as wind, fire, and water in Homer and the Heroic Tradition. But while Whitman treats the liquid element only occasionally and apparently refers to it indifferently as the sea or simply as water, I observe in the Iliad a thematically meaningful distinction between salt and fresh waters. This ancient antithesis, which may ultimately reflect a dichotomy evident also in ancient Mesopotamian myth, lends the earli- est extant Greek epic a sense of unity in setting and plot and endows heroic action with greater cosmic and theological significance. GREEKS AND THE SEA As early as Book 2 of the Iliad, a remarkable series of similes emphati- cally associates noisy Greeks with the roaring sea. Their assembled army will not only resound like a wave in answering its leaders, but it will also move in a wave toward battle. When Agamemnon unwisely proposes returning home, the army loudly rushes toward the ships in waves (2.144): Kivf|0r| 8' dcyopri cpf] icojiccTa jiocKpa QaXdaariq ("And the assembly was moved like the sea's long waves"). After Odysseus calms the turbulent soldiery, convincing them to return to assembly, the gathering sounds like surf (207-10): . . . oi 5' 6Vyopriv5e OCOTIC; ?7C?OG?1L)OVTO V?C0V OCftO Kai K^lGldcOV rixfj, (oq ot? icuina 7ioX,D(p^o{opoio QaXddGlf]^ 210 aiyia^co jnEydtap ppeneiai, ojiapayd 5?

Building on Whitman's observation, I shall show that this identification, as well as the parallel association of Trojans with Scamander/Xanthus in particular and rivers in general, can be traced back at least to Book 2.</page><page sequence="3">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 477 ... And toward assembly Again they rushed from their ships and huts With a resounding clamor, as when a wave of the loud-rumbling sea Roars on a large beach, and the deep sea thunders.3 The echoing or clamoring sound raised by Greeks here (rixfj, 209) is identical to the resounding noise made by the sea earlier in Book 1 in a memorably sonorous verse (1.157): ouped xe GKioevxoc QaXaaaa TerrxQeqoa ("Shady mountains as well as resounding sea").4 Thus, after the first word of 2.209, even before the comparison is actually expressed, the Greek assembly raises a sound that recalls the sea. Although the simile formally pivots on the common sound of army and water, the mob's rushing motion (enEaaevovxo, 208) is also consistent with the image of a surging liquid.5 Later, when Odysseus encourages the Greeks in their quest to sack Troy, the army roars its assent (333): coq ecpocx', 'Apyeioi 5e piy' uxxov ("Thus he spoke, and the Argives clamored loudly"). Here the assembly produces the same roaring noise as that made in Book 1 by the sea's wave (1.481-82): icvjjaoc / . . . jisydV ia%? ("The wave . . . resounded loudly"). Skeptics may initially hesitate to accept any association of Greeks with waves at 2.333, but not long thereafter, that line's opening phrases, repeated verbatim, will be immediately followed by yet another sea simile, when the Argives roar their assent to a speech delivered by Agamemnon (394-97): coc; ecpocx', 'Apyeioi 8e niy' taypv ax; oxe tcouxx 395 ocKxfi ecp' \)\|/t|?iti, oxe Kivfian Noxoq ?^6cbv, 7tpopArjxi GKonekco- xov 8' ov 7coxe K-ojiaxa Xeimi 7iavxo(cov dveuxov, ox' dv evG' r\ ev6a ysvcovxai. Thus he spoke, and the Argives clamored loudly, like a wave On a high promontory, when the South wind comes and drives it On a jutting cliff, one which no waves ever evade Under any type of wind, whether arising from this side or that. 3 All translations of the Greek are mine. 4In the latter part of //. 1.157, the word "sea" (Gdtaxaaoc) actually rhymes with "sounding" or "echoing" (fi%r|?aaa).Thus the sea's reverberation is indicated both seman- tically and acoustically. This artful instance of onomatopoeic parechesis lays stress on the echoing sea. The line's final word, underscored by a preceding hiatus, receives further emphasis from the rhythm since its spondee disrupts an otherwise dactylic verse. 5 Elsewhere seud and its compounds refer to the motion of various things, including gushing blood (//. 5.208, 21.167) and surging waves (Od. 5.314, 421, 431).</page><page sequence="4">478 JONATHAN FENNO This simile begins with the same words as the foregoing comparison of noisy army to sea (394, cf. 209): coc; oxe kSjicc ("as when a wave"). Earlier these words were immediately preceded by "with a resounding clamor" (fl%fl), and here they follow "they clamored" (i'a%ov).The repeated vocab- ulary for "echoing" serves various poetic functions: to imitate the sound in question, to draw our attention to the setting by the shore, and to introduce and amplify the association of Greek forces with the sea. The persistent comparison of an assembled army to a body of water documented above (2.144, 207-10, 394-97)6 establishes a theme that will recur, with variation, not only explicitly in other similes, but also, I suggest, implicitly in subsequent metaphors. For instance, the notion that armies may move like water, already illustrated in a brief compari? son (144), will later in Book 2 find at least potential expression through a hydrokinetic metaphor, that is, through vocabulary regularly applied to liquid motion. The Greeks, who had earlier "rushed" noisily from their ships and huts to assembly, explicitly sounding like waves (ekeggevovto vecov ocrco Kai K^iaidcov, 208), now loudly "pour forth" from their ships and huts into the plain of the river Scamander (vecov ano Kai K^iaidcov / eq 7te8iov 7tpo%eovTo XKajidv8piov, 464-65). Their invasion is not unlike a tidal flood. In subsequent episodes they will again "pour" from their ships when battle is joined by Patroclus (?k vrjcov e%eovxo, 16.267; cf. 8^?%?ovto, 259) and then by Achilles (d7tdvei)6e vecov e%eovxo, 19.356).7 Admittedly, verbs such as seuo, kheo, and rheo commonly show extended meanings that do not necessarily evoke the idea of water in motion. But within the Iliad, where troops will be explicitly likened to water over and over again, the latent image seems to acquire a more persistent evocative power. The complex of Iliadic similes that compare men in motion to 6 The repeated sea similes near the beginning of the Iliad caught the attention of later epic poets. Apollonius of Rhodes employs similar expressions to represent the clam- oring of the gathered Colchians, who resound like the sea (3.1370-71): uiy' i'a%ov, (oq oxe novxoq I i'axev. The first simile of Vergil's Aeneid prominently likens Neptune's calming the stormy sea to a respected statesman's pacifying a tumultuous throng (1.148-56): just as the rabble grows quiet, so does all the sea's roaring subside. While in epic poetry the resound- ing sea typically represents a noisy assembly of soldiers, the sympotic poet Anacreon associates the sound with a boisterous drinking companion (fr. 427.1-2): ur|8' cocrce icojioc rcovxiov / XdXa^e ("Do not keep chattering like a sea's wave!"). 7 Likewise in the Odyssey, Greeks "pour out" of the wooden horse (eK%\)U?voi, Od. 8.515). The verb seud, "to rush," and its compounds are roughly synonymous with khed, "to pour," and its compounds in describing the motion not only of Greeks but also of Trojans, as will be demonstrated later. The idea that armies move like bodies of water also poten? tially finds expression in the use of epirreo, "to stream on and on," to characterize the continuous stream of infantry gathering near a river's mouth (//. 11.724).</page><page sequence="5">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 479 water could be interpreted as poetic amplifications of traditional lan? guage about warriors "pouring" or "streaming" into the field. In the Iliad, where various similes elaborately develop a system of hydropolemic imagery, expressions that might seem, in isolation, to be no more than dead metaphors become more vivid. Like wise, water itself will come to life as a combatant in the natural world and on the divine level. Just as heroes sometimes resemble water, so can bodies of water sound and act like warriors.8 For example, in Book 4, when the Greeks first march from camp toward Troy, an extended simile likens their ranks to a series of echoing waves loudly roaring against the shore. Once again, as in Book 2, Greeks are explicitly compared to the sea. Within this simile, however, the familiar theme is reflexively enhanced by metaphorical language that simultaneously endows water with certain characteristics of a soldier (4.422-28): cbc; 8' ox' ev aiyiot^cp 7ioAa)ti%81 kuucc daXdaor\(; opvox' ?7iaao~\)xepov Zecpiapoi) \Stxo Ktvrioavxoq?

As when on the loudly resounding shore a wave of the sea Rises up, one close upon another, driven by the West Wind: First of all it puts on a crest on the deep, and then, Breaking on dry land, roars loudly, and around the headlands, In an arch, it raises its head and spits out salty foam; So then, one close upon another, the ranks of the Danaans moved Relentlessly toward battle . . . In this extraordinary passage each wave not only "puts on a crest," that is, a crested helmet (Kopuaaexoci, 424), as if it were a warrior putting on arms,9 but it also raises its head (Kopucpouxou, 426) and even "spits out" salty spray (d7C07m&gt;ei, 426). Within the simile the sea has assumed the features, or at least the figurative head and mouth, of a belligerent Greek. The partial personification of a body of water here in Book 4 anticipates a more developed prosopopeia in Books 13 and 14, where 8 Whitman 1958,130,145, makes a similar observation about fire and warriors. 9 See Markwald 1982, s.v., for the interpretation of korusso as "behelmen" or "rusteri" at //. 4.424 and 21.306. The former passage involves a personified sea, the latter an anthro- pomorphic river.</page><page sequence="6">480 JONATHAN FENNO Poseidon himself will eventually emerge from the exuberant sea, take human form, and lead the Greeks against Hector in the battle by the ships. Not only do sea divinities support the Greeks in the Iliad but their mortal descendants fight exclusively on the Greek side, which seems significant since, as we shall soon see, the offspring of freshwater nymphs and river gods are prominently affiliated with Trojans. Amphimachus, for example, is identified as the grandson of Poseidon, and his death (13.206- 7) functions to anger that god and motivate him to become even more openly involved in the battle. Soon thereafter Poseidon intervenes to save Nestor's son Antilochus (551-55), who would seem to be his own great-grandson.10 Of course the most important mortal descended from a sea divinity in the Iliad is Achilles, son of the Nereid Thetis, a goddess who does not become directly involved in the fighting but nevertheless plays a pivotal role in the plot.11 She sent Achilles with his ships to Troy to fight the Trojans (18.58-59), and through her considerable influence she persuades Zeus to honor her son.12 Underscoring Achilles' unique pedigree, Thetis complains that she alone of all the salt-sea goddesses was compelled to wed a mortal man (432-33).13 Certainly no Trojan can claim to be the son of a sea goddess. As the monumental epic's central hero, Achilles embodies an im? portant theme that will be elaborated in various ways: being the son of Thetis, he will naturally show an affinity to the sea (and even a certain antagonism toward rivers and their offspring). Already in Book 1 our hero withdraws to the salty sea, sits looking out upon the deep, and prays 10 Janko 1992, ad 77. 13.554-55, argues that, in this passage, Antilochus "is called Nestor's son to show that Poseidon is protecting his great-grandson." Although the Iliad does not explicitly trace Antilochus' lineage through Nestor and Neleus back to Poseidon, the Odyssey does do so {Od. 11.238-57, 281-86). 11 For the power of Thetis in the Iliad, see Slatkin 1991. 12 According to the Iliad, Thetis was an invaluable ally of Zeus: she alone assisted him against the other Olympians in revolt, and she summoned Briareus, a hundred-handed creature mightier than his father, known to mortals as Aegaeon (//. 1.396-406), a name suggesting the Aegean Sea. According to another tradition, however, Thetis represented a threat to Zeus' rule, since her son was destined to be greater than his father (e.g., Pi. Isthm. 8.27-37, A. Prom. 908-27). Certain Iliadic passages suggest that Thetis' son is analogous to a non-human, invincible creature born from the elements, almost another Briareus: e.g., "Peleus was not your father, nor was Thetis your mother, but the sea bore you, and rocks" (//. 16.33-35); "Your mother nursed you with bile [rather than milk]" (203); "Even if he boasts to be made entirely of bronze" (20.102). 13 Hesiod lists two Nereids who mated with mortal men: Psamathe with Aeacus to produce Phocus, and Thetis with Peleus (son of Aeacus) to produce Achilles (Th. 1003-7).</page><page sequence="7">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 481 to his Nereid mother (1.348-51). Hearing her son from the depths, where she sits beside her father, the Old Man of the Salty Sea, Thetis quickly rises forth from the gray saltwater, like a mist (icap7ca?U|aco&lt;; 8' ave5\) TCo^ifjc; aXbq r\m' 6\ii%kr\, 359). This initial encounter between mother and son creates a memorable image of the Greek hero almost embraced by a mist from the sea. Throughout most of the poem Achilles waits by his ships near the sea. At important moments we are told that he goes to the sea, or else Thetis comes to him from it. For instance, in Book 18, when he first learns of Patroclus' death and laments terribly, she hears him again from the depths, and as she journeys toward Troy, accompanied by the Nereids (more than thirty of whom are actually named), the sea breaks open around them. Upon their arrival, they begin stepping out onto the shore, one after another in a row (ockthv daavePaivov emoxepco, 18.68), moving in the manner of waves.14 When Thetis learns from her son what has happened, she sends the Nereids back into the sea to tell their father, which suggests that the fate of Achilles is of some impor- tance to Nereus, even if the Old Man of the Salty Sea is not so actively involved in the fighting as Poseidon. In Book 19, when Achilles has decided to announce his return to battle, he summons an assembly by raising a loud clamor (id%cov) near the seashore (19.40-41). Later, after killing Hector, but before burying Patroclus, Achilles (with the Myrmi- dons) spends the night lying on the sand by the sea, where waves wash the shore (23.59-61). Also near the shore he has a gravemound built up for Patroclus and himself (125-26).15 After Patroclus' funeral, Achilles apparently spends several sleepless nights restlessly pacing about by the shore of the salty sea (24.1-18, cf. 31).16 Here, in the poem's final book, 14 The shape of the sea begins to resemble the form of the goddess in the following line: "He [sc. Dionysus] dove beneath the wave of the salty sea, and Thetis received him in her bosom" (8\)a?0' aXbq koctcc kuuxx, Getk; 5' i)7re58^axo koAjtco, //. 6.136; cf. 18.398). Here an ambiguity arises from the Greek word kolpos, which, like the Latin sinus, may refer to the curve of a woman's lap as well as to the slope of a wave or the bend of a bay (e.g., ftaXaoor\c, evpia koXkov, 18.140; aXbq ?i)pea koXtiov, 21.125). 15 In the Odyssey, as the Greeks prepare Achilles' funeral, his mother emerges from the sea accompanied by the goddesses of the salty sea, and a supernatural shouting arises over the deep, and all the Greeks tremble in fear. Then the daughters of the Old Man of the Salty Sea lament the death of Achilles for seventeen days and nights (Od. 24.47-49,55-59). 16 As Achilles recalls all the troubles he had experienced in the company of Patroclus, he employs a kind of zeugma that posits a parallel between wars and waves: "cleaving his way through troublesome waves as well as battles with men" (dv5p(ov te nxoX?\iox&gt;q dtay?ivd te KiauxxTa 7i?ipcov, //. 24.8). In this interesting expression, the verb peiro, "to pierce," which applies literally to its nearest noun, must be understood metaphorically with its other direct object. Some scholars have suggested excising this line, supposing that it has been interpo-</page><page sequence="8">482 JONATHAN FENNO we also learn that Thetis comes to her son from the sea day and night (73), reenacting their reunion of Book 1. TROJANS AND RIVERS The figurative assimilation of the sea to the Greek side appears more significant once we realize that it will be complemented by repeated association of Trojans (and their allies) with rivers, by virtue of motion and sound as well as genealogical and biographical details. The alliance of Troy and sweet water, increasingly evident in a developing network of metaphors, similes, and personifications, reveals its fullest expression in Book 21, the climax of water imagery in the Iliad. Here Achilles will fight in the river against Trojans who move and sound like water, in particular against the formidable grandson of a river (and eventually against the raging river itself).17 Let us begin with Trojan biographies that are closely connected to freshwater, in terms of both birth and death. In the Iliad, while Achilles alone is born from a goddess of the sea, only the Trojans and their allies are identified as sons of Naiad nymphs.18 Similarly, while the Greeks can count among their number Amphimachus, son of the sea god Poseidon, that hero will later be balanced by the Trojan ally Asteropaeus, grandson of the river Axius.19 Just as Amphimachus ("Fighter-on-Both-Sides") is lated from the Odyssey, where it is used repeatedly (Od. 8.183; 13.91, 264) and where hardships on the sea are explicitly part of the poem's action. I would point out, however, that the metaphorical association of water and war expressed by this verse is quite at home in the Iliad, especially when spoken by the son of a sea goddess who then haunts the shore. 17 For discussion of the river fight within the plot of the Iliad, see Scheibner 1939,27- 41,90-101,118-21. 18 Sons of Lake Gygaea: Mesthles and Antiphus (//. 2.864-65). Sons of Naiad nymphs: Aesepus and Pedasus (6.21-28), Satnius (14.443-45), and Iphition, born near Lake Gygaea, and the rivers Hyllus and Hermus (20.382-93). 19 Although Asteropaeus is the most prominent descendant of a river in the Iliad, some Greeks are admittedly affiliated with rivers of their distant homeland: the unfortu- nate twins Crethon and Orsilochus, great-grandsons of the Alpheius (//. 5.541-60, cf. 561, 574), and the Myrmidon captain Menesthius, son of Peleus' daughter Polydora and the Spercheius (16.173-78). Although Achilles' family naturally has close ties to the river of their native land, in the Iliad Achilles himself will repeatedly nullify vows to rivers and disparage their ability to protect even their own offspring (e.g., 21.128-35,184-99; 23.141- 51). As a variation on this theme, the Greek hero will also taunt the mortally wounded Iphition, son of a Naiad nymph, contrasting his death on the Trojan plain with his birth by the Gygaean Lake and his fatherland by the rivers Hyllus and Hermus (20.389-92).</page><page sequence="9">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 483 killed by Hector near the sea, so Asteropaeus, who happens to be ambi- dextrous (djicpiq, 21.162), will be slain by Achilles in a river.20 Already at the end of Book 2, the Trojan catalog foreshadows the pitiable end of many soldiers at the hands of Achilles "in the river" (2.860-61, cf. 874- 75). A similarly unhappy fate also awaits several individuals who are closely affiliated with freshwater or named after rivers.21 The Trojan Simoisius, for example, born on the banks of the river Simois, ironically falls in the dust and lies dead on the ground (killed by Ajax), just as a felled tree lies drying by a river's banks (4.473-89). In birth as well as death, Simoisius is fittingly named. Death in battle awaits even Hypsenor, son of Dolopion, who was priest of the river Scamander and was hon- ored by his people as a god (5.76-83). Hector, who will eventually meet his fate near the twin springs of the river Scamander (22.208, cf. 147-57), significantly calls his own doomed son Scamandrius after the river (6.402- 3). This child's alternate names, Scamandrius and Astyanax, "Lord of the City," suggest an intimate association of rivers, Troy, and the royal family.22 The close connection between Troy and its rivers will be disparaged repeatedly by Achilles in Book 21 as he attacks Trojans who have sought refuge in the Scamander. There he captures twelve youths to be slaugh- tered in a cruel sacrifice at Patroclus' funeral (21.26-32). Then, after pitilessly killing Priam's unarmed son Lycaon, causing his blood to wet 20 There is another Amphimachus, a Trojan ally whose name and fate also fore- shadow the death of ambidextrous Asteropaeus, since this Trojan "Fighter-on-Both-Sides" was possibly killed by Achilles in the river (//. 2.870-75, where the nearest antecedent of the relative pronoun is Amphimachus). 21 Trojans (and allies) named after rivers: Simoisius, son of flowery Anthemion, born on the river's banks, died too young to reward his parents for raising him (//. 4.473-89); Scamandrius, killed in battle despite all that Artemis had taught him about hunting animals (5.49-58); Scamandrius/Astyanax, doomed after his father's death, his mother predicts, to slavery or death in infancy (6.402-3, cf. 24.726-35); and Satnius, born from a Naiad nymph on the river's banks (14.442-48). Also worthy of mention are homonymous rivers and warriors: Xanthus, whose death, along with that of his brother, swift Thoon, left his aged father without an heir (5.152-58), and Aesepus (6.21). In this category one might also include Rhesus, killed in his sleep before actually fighting, the son of Eioneus, whose name recalls the seashore or a riverbank (10.435) (the same genealogical pattern is followed in the Rhesus, where the play's eponymous hero, son of the river Strymon and a Muse, was raised by fountain nymphs [E. Rh. 919-31]). 22 The affiliation of Trojans and rivers was productive also in non-Iliadic mythopoeia. In Apollodorus' genealogy of the Trojan royal family (3.12.1-6), generation after genera- tion is descended from rivers. The Troad's first ruler, Teucer, was the son of the Scamander, and subsequent royalty continued to marry and produce children from the daughters of rivers, including the Scamander (Callirhoe, Strymo), the Simois (Astyoche, Hieromneme), the Cebren (Asterope, Oenone), and, according to some accounts, the Sangarius (Hecuba).</page><page sequence="10">484 JONATHAN FENNO the ground, Achilles throws him into the stream, predicting that the unburied body will be carried by the river to the sea's waves, where fishes will consume its flesh (115-27). Next, Achilles threatens to slaughter Trojans in general, employing the same verb that had been used in the catalog (K?pa*i^cov, 129; cf. Kepdi'^e, 2.861). He boasts that not even the river will help them, though they have doubtless offered it many sacrifices in the past (21.128-35). Finally, Asteropaeus stands against Achilles from out of the river (144-45). As grandson of the river Axius, a lineage emphatically mentioned twice in a brief interval (140-43, 157-60), Asteropaeus caps the list of doomed Trojans affiliated with freshwater. Although he gains the distinction of being the only warrior who manages to wound Achilles in the Iliad, even Asteropaeus cannot pull that hero's spear from the bank, and as he dies, his guts gush out upon the ground (xijvto %ajLtai %o^d8ec,, 181). Asteropaeus' miserable end in the corpse- fraught, blood-stained river, where fishes will feed on his remains, recalls the fates of Simoisius and Lycaon. Savagely leaping on Asteropaeus' chest, Achilles again mocks the efficacy of prayers and sacrifices to rivers, whose offspring he now disparages (184-99).23 By flamboyantly display- ing a thematic contempt for rivers, Achilles, grandson of the Old Man of the Sea, will bring to its climax a larger pattern that affiliates Trojans with sweet water and their enemies with saltwater. Let us now turn to the motion and sound of Trojans, beginning in assembly, continuing on the battlefield, and culminating in their noisy retreat into the river and finally back into the city. The liquid undertones of Trojan assemblies, admittedly less direct than those of Greek gather- ings, are perceptible only as part of a larger network of images, including numerous similes that explicitly compare Trojan warriors to rivers. When Hector releases the very first Trojan gathering of the Iliad, the soldiery "rushes" from the city's open gates with a great rumble (coiyvovio rcuAm, 8K 8' ?ggdto Juxoc,, / . . . jcoAax; 5' opujiocyScx; opcopei, 2.809-10 = 8.58-59). Much as Trojans repeatedly "rush out" of the city's open gates, and much as Hector, accompanied by Alexander, "rushes out" through the gates (7to^8cdv 8^8aa\)xo, 7.1), so later will they "pour into" the gates of the Greek wall (eaexDvxo nvXaq, 12.470) and "pour forth" rank after rank (7ipo%80vTO cpa?iayyr|86v, 15.360). In the latter episode the metaphorical stream of Trojans is led by Apollo, who breaches the wall as easily as a child scatters sand by the sea (literally the fortifications are "confounded" 23 By speaking hyperbolically against rivers, Achilles expands a theme otherwise developed primarily by the narrator and also applies it to himself. This accords with the general characteristics of Achilles' language as analyzed by Martin 1989,146-205.</page><page sequence="11">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 485 or "poured together" [gvve%eve, 364; cniyxeaq, 366]). Since a proleptic passage has already informed us that after the war the Greek wall will be literally inundated by Trojan rivers diverted by Apollo (12.1-35), its figurative flooding here, under direction of the same god, appears to sustain the hydraulic image. Likewise, even in their final flight before Achilles, some Trojans "pour forth" toward the city (7rpo%eovTo, 21.6), while others, as if they were a kind of tributary, collect or "pool together" into the river (eq 7toTa|u6v riA.rovxo, 8). Achilles, who is actually compared at one point to an irrigator (dvnp oxexriycx;, 257-64), will effectively re? verse and subdue the figurative stream of Trojan warriors, causing them to "pour into" Troy "in a rush" (?ggx&gt;pivccx; Eoe%x&gt;vxo, 610) and to collect behind the city's walls (eiq acrro a^ev, 22.12)?not entirely unlike a pool of water (cf. aXkv iSScop, 23.420). The rushing motion of the first Trojan assembly created a great rumbling sound (6pD|LiaY56&lt;;, 2.810 = 8.59). The term orymagdos, "rum- bling," which appears here for the first time, will later be used in close connection with rivers.24 At its next occurrence (4.449), the word is effec? tively glossed by an expanded simile that compares the rumbling created by an armed encounter to the noise made by mountain torrents (446-56). Here the narrator explicitly associates orymagdos with rushing water. This link is made even more direct by the term's final two instances (21.256, 313), which denote the rumbling raised by the Scamander and the Simois as they attack Achilles. These rivers sound exactly like the Trojan army. The Trojans assemble not only within the city but also on the plain. The first such meeting is convened by Hector "apart from the ships .. . beside a swirling river" (8.490), in marked contrast to Greek gatherings near the shore. During the next assembly in the field, Hector speaks against retreating and collecting together within the city's walls (18.285- 309). For these Trojan meetings the river supplies not only the setting but also the sound. Just as Greeks clamored like the resounding sea in endorsing their leaders' speeches by the ships, so do Trojans on the plain repeatedly respond to Hector's orations by babbling, as if they were a 24 In the Iliad the word orymagdos generally refers to the rumbling of battle as Trojans fight Greeks: //. 4.449 (introducing a river simile), 8.63; 17.424, 741 (its somewhat wider application within similes functions to illustrate the ruckus of battle: 10.185,16.633). While the Iliad never attributes this noise exclusively to Greeks, it commonly appears as a formulaic attribute of Trojans alone, as they rush from the city's opened gates (2.810 = 8.59), as they engage in battle (9.248, 10.539, 17.461), and even as rivers literally fight Achilles (21.256, 313).</page><page sequence="12">486 JONATHAN FENNO river (8.542 = 18.310): coc, "Eicccop dyopei)', eki 8e Tpcoec, Ketax8r|0"av ("Thus Hector addressed the assembly, and the Trojans murmured their assent"). This babbling noise that accompanies Trojan assemblies may elsewhere appear as the exemplary sound of rapidly running water. For instance, one swiftly streaming torrent in mountainous Arcadia apparently bears the telling name Celadon, "Murmurer." The same sound is produced by a river engraved on Achilles' microcosmic shield (18.576): rcdp 7totccjiov Ke^dSovxcx, Ttocpd po8avov SovccKrja ("Near the murmuring river, nearby the wavering reed"). The sound effects of this admirably symmetrical verse suggest a marked sensitivity to a river's sound.25 The same kind of babbling will recur in the river fight at an especially noisy moment, as Trojans fall into the water with a loud splash and as flowing streams ring out while shouting warriors swim about. Thus "the murmuring stream was filled pell-mell with horses and men" (nXr\xo pooq K8^d5cov 87cijlii^ i7i7icov T8 kou dv8pa&gt;v, 21.16). Here the sound of Trojan warriors has become nearly indistinguishable from that of the river, not by virtue of simile or metaphor but rather through the action itself. The figurative association of Trojans and rivers is also evident in a series of similes likening heroes on the battlefield to rushing rivers that break dams, ruin fields, and sweep trees and boulders toward the sea. On the first day of fighting recounted in the Iliad, Hector is compared to a terrifying river that flows swiftly toward the salty sea (5.596-600). Later his temporary drive toward the sea through the Greek ships resembles a careening boulder dislodged from a cliff by a rain-swollen torrent (13.136- 45). Likewise his horse-drawn chariot is compared to rivers in flood and rainwater rushing down mountains toward the salty sea (16.384-93). Yet another hydropolemic simile will illustrate Hector's leading of the Tro? jans against the Greeks to contend for Patroclus' corpse. This compari? son not only assimilates armies to water, since their violent collision resembles a river flowing into the sea, but it also partially personifies nature, since the waterfronts' sound metaphorically calls to mind the shouting of warriors (17.263-67): 25 The pure dactylic rhythm of//. 18.576 runs along without interruption by spondees. At least half of the line's consonants are so-called "liquids." Of the seventeen vowels all but two are short o- or #-sounds, which are artfully varied to echo the sound of potamos, "river." The central words in each half of the line (7roxa|i6v and po5avov) exhibit complete assonance: -o-a-6- (unless one reads pabaXbv with Zenodotus). Artful anaphora of the same preposition (7idp and napa) begins both the first and second parts of the verse. The remainder of the first half of the line, the phrase "the murmuring river," is echoed precisely by the rhythm and articulation of the rest of the line's second half, "the wavering reed" (:UU-:UU-U:).</page><page sequence="13">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 487 &amp;&gt;&lt;; 5' 6x' ?7ti 7tpo%of|oi dunexioq 7ioxajioto peppD^EV uiya icojaa 710x1 poov, duxpi 5e x' otKpai 265 riioveq ftoocoaiv Epevyo[iEvr\q aXbc, s^co, xooari dpa Tpcoec; taxfi i'aav. auxdp 'A%atoi eaxaaav...

But the Achaeans Stood in place . .. This hydropolemic image opposes two different types of water: "a great wave against the stream" (jjiya icujia tcoti poov, 264), the latter appar? ently representing Trojans, the former, Greeks. As the simile develops, the waterfronts themselves actually "shout" (poocooiv, 265). This vivid metaphor, cited by Aristotle as a poetic expression (Po. 1458b31), reflex- ively intensifies the comparison: the soldiers resound like riverbanks or seashores, which in turn "shout."26 Here, although the Trojans' attack resembles a raging torrent flowing into the sea, Greeks stand firm against them. In another simile later in the same book, the Trojan offensive is again illustrated in hydropolemic terms, as the immovable Aiantes re- semble a ridge diverting the water of mighty rivers (//. 17.746-53).27 The poem's river similes will eventually be capped and vividly inverted in Book 21 by the transformation of the Scamander and the Simois into warriors hostile to Achilles. 26 Riverbanks or seashores that "shout" (podoc, //. 14.394; poocoaiv, 17.265) might be compared to cresting waves that "bellow" or "belch" (epe-uyojievrn;, 17.265; cf. Od. 5.403, 438) and sometimes even "spit" (anonroEi, //. 4.426), as if they had "mouths." Admittedly, none of these passages explicitly uses the Greek word for "mouth," stoma, which is else? where applied to rivers (//. 12.24, Od. 5.441) and waterfronts (//. 14.36, Od. 10.90). But the image, I suggest, is not entirely dead within the Iliad, a poem where water can take on human features and water gods are an actual, living presence. In the Odyssean passage that mentions a river's "mouth" {Od. 5.441), the anthropomorphism apparently extends so far as to allow Odysseus to imagine that the river also has "knees" of some sort (449). 27 Much as the Iliadic Aiantes fend off the battling of the Trojans (|id%r|v dveepyov, //. 17.752) in the manner of a promontory that holds back water (ioxdvei u5cop, 747) and checks rivers' streams (Ttoxocuxov . . . peeGpa / i'axei, 749-50), so does the ideal warrior, as described by the elegiac poet Tyrtaeus, hold back the wave of battle (eoxeOe icuuxx \idxr\c, Tyrt. 12.22).</page><page sequence="14">488 JONATHAN FENNO THE EBB AND FLOW OF BATTLE The general association of the Greek camp with the sea and the Trojan side with rivers is not to be conceived as a simple and invariable equa- tion, nor does it preclude the development of other types of elemental imagery. In fact water similes in the Iliad function not to create a rigid allegory but rather to invoke the setting in such a way as to draw the waterscape into the action. Sea similes, for instance, naturally illustrate events relatively near the shore, which is normally dominated by Greeks but in exceptional circumstances may be overwhelmed by Trojans. Like- wise, river similes, which effectively manifest the Trojan urge to sweep the invaders into the sea, may also occasionally be applied to Greeks who have ventured deep into enemy territory. Thus, as one army ad- vances into an area typically occupied by the other, the alliance of Greeks with the sea or Trojans with rivers may sometimes shift temporarily as if reflecting the ebb and flow of battle. On the first day of fighting in the Iliad, the Greeks had marched from camp in ranks likened to advancing waves with the features of helmeted warriors (4.422-28). This simile, already treated above, intensi- fies the familiar association of Greeks with the sea by animating a body of water that seems to identify itself as a combatant. Within a few lines this comparison will be counterbalanced by a vivid river simile that marks the first armed encounter with the Trojan army further inland. Strictly speaking, the following comparison likens both sides to moun- tain streams, presumably since the battle is conceived as taking place too far from the shore to evoke a comparison of Greeks to the sea. As the two sides meet, thrusting shields and spears together, a great rumbling arises, and many men are killed (451?56): . . . p|e 8' oujiaxi yaia. ooc; 8' 6t? xeijiappoi 7ioxajLioi kocx' opeacpi peovxec; ec, litaydyKeiav cru|LiPdM,?xov 6pptjiov \j8cop Kpouvcov ?K jueydtaov KoxX^q ?vxoa0? %apd8pr|c., 455 xcov 8e xe xr|^6o?

The poem's first river simile is introduced by a suitably colorful expres- sion, "the earth streamed with blood" (pee 8' aijiocxi yaia, 451). The image of this gory stream is figuratively extended in the simile's first verse, which compares storm-swollen torrents streaming down the moun- tainside (xeijiappoi rcoTajaoi... peovxeq, 452). In the following line these rivers will begin to undergo a partial metamorphosis into armed combat- ants. Just as soldiers had thrust shields and spears against one another in the immediately preceding action (ovv p' efiaXov pivoix;, &lt;ybv 5' ey%ea, 447), so now do rivers "thrust" water at each other (av^aXkexov oppijiov \S8cop, 453) as if they were holding shields or spears. The resemblance of water to weapon is reinforced by the terminal position in the Greek of the phrase "mighty water," which takes the place of the frequent formula "mighty spear" (oppijiov 8y%o&lt;;).28 If the sea's waves can be imagined as marching in ranks and donning crested helmets, then torrential streams should be able to wield mighty spears as they join battle. The formal point of comparison specified at the simile's conclusion, namely, the corresponding noise of water and armies, is reinforced by hydrokinetic vocabulary: here Greeks and Trojans literally "mixed together" (jiiayo- juivcov, 456), which I have freely translated above as "ran together." Of course the verb misgo/mignumi, cognate with English "mix," shows a variety of extended meanings that often have no connection with water. But the preceding focus on the "mixture" or "junction" of streams, the place where they "run together" (jiiaydyKeiav, 453), has brought into the foreground the word's liquid connotation. In this way the first river simile serves as a poetic gloss on the common expression to "mix" or "join" battle. Thus the noisy "mixing" of Greeks and Trojans, at least in this context, suggests a hydropolemic metaphor. The inland setting of this battle will soon inspire another river simile. Here the Greek hero Diomedes is likened to a stream flooding 28 Iliadic spears are formulaically characterized by the adjective obrimos, "mighty" (e.g., //. 3.357,4.529).The only other thing modified by that word in the Iliad is water, in this line (4.453). When applied to persons, obrimos has a strong Trojan affiliation since it formulaically refers to Hector and Ares (the only time it is used of a Greek, also its only appearance in the vocative case, is when a uniquely talking horse addresses Achilles at 19.408).</page><page sequence="16">490 JONATHAN FENNO over the plain and scattering its embankments, but only when he explic- itly fights so closely mingled with Trojans that he is hardly distinguish- able from them (5.85-94).29 As if to explain the shift from sea to river, the narrator introduces the comparison with this observation: "You could not recognize to which side the son of Tydeus belonged, whether he accompanied Trojans or Achaeans." A Greek most resembles a stream when he blends in amongst Trojans. Another line also confirms that Diomedes "mixed" (in battle) with Trojans (Tpcoeaai piyr|, 143). In the subsequent river simile in the same book, the Greek will actually yield the image to a Trojan: at the sight of Hector rushing forth, Diomedes retreats as a man frightened by a river in flood sweeping toward the sea (596-600). Thus Diomedes is the proverbial exception that proves the rule. Similarly the other Greek hero compared to a river wreaking havoc on the plain, Ajax (11.492-97), will later, in another river simile, stand against Trojans like a promontory resisting the streams of mighty rivers (17.746-53). The latter role, as a stubbornly unyielding dam rather than a wildly charging river, seems much more typical of gigantic Ajax, known formulaically as the "bulwark of the Achaeans" (3.229, 6.5, 7.211), who carries a "shield like a tower" (7.219, 11.485, 17.128). In the end, rivers remain more emblematic of Trojans than of Greeks. As the battle turns and Trojans advance toward the shore, their association with rivers may fluctuate to reflect the changing tide of war, 29 The simile draws attention to the noun gephyrai ("dams" or "embankments") by employing it in successive lines (//. 5.88, 89): Diomedes, routing the enemy, resembles a flooded stream that breaches its "embankments" and cannot be held back by its "embank? ments." This comparison functions as a poetic gloss of the word's first occurrence, in the preceding book, where it was part of an ambiguous phrase, "dams of war" or "dykes of battle" (nioAiuoio yecpupccc;, 4.371,8.378,553; 11.160,20.427). In fact, except for the simile in question, the noun gephyrai occurs in the Iliad only within this set phrase, which may indicate some kind of military embankment or, by extension, the Trojan battlefield in general. In any case, the formula was first employed by Agamemnon to suggest that Diomedes had been cowering behind the lines, idly gazing upon the dams of war (4.371). But these aspersions are refuted by the action elucidated by the simile at 5.84-94: the hero does not simply look upon the dams of war; he rushes over them or breaks them down, at least figuratively. The last instance of the formula will not only recall the first but also associate it with the poem's leading heroes, when Achilles mocks Hector for cowering along the dams of war (20.427). Finally, in Book 21, the verb gephuroo, cognate with gephurai, will denote the ineffectual damming or obstruction of an animated body of water that actually routs Achilles (21.245, cf. 15.357). To summarize, the recurring phrase "dams of war"?elaborated by a river simile and ultimately by the animation of a river god? contributes to the poem's hydropolemic imagery by suggesting that military embankments resemble a river's banks, just as warriors are analogous to rushing water.</page><page sequence="17">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 491 or it may be supplemented by other systems of elemental imagery. In one pair of similes, Hector is repeatedly likened to a whirlwind lashing the sea: he kills a long list of Greek captains, like a windstorm that strikes the waves and scatters the spray (11.296-98, 304-9). Here the retreating Greek lines resemble wind-beaten waves?a familiar theme?while Hec? tor acts not like a river but rather a whirlwind, another fitting symbol for the champion of Troy, the quintessential "windy" city ("Itaov fjvejioeo- aav).30 Later, when Trojans begin to fight closely among the enemy at the very ships and the battle line becomes extremely confused, another group of similes will figuratively associate them not only with wind but also with wind-swept waves (13.795-801; 15.381-84, 618-22, 624-29). In fact the first of these similes compares Trojans to a loud blast of wind that literally becomes mixed with the salty sea (d^i jiicyexai, 13.797). The chaos is described by Nestor in similar terms (14.58-60): "So confusedly (87iijii^) are Achaeans being slain, you could no longer recognize, even at close inspection, from which side they are being driven in rout." This observation, like the narrator's earlier description of Diomedes' incur- sion into Trojan ranks (5.85-88), seems to signal, almost to explain, the mixed imagery. POSEIDON AGAINST HECTOR Hydromachy pervades the action of the Iliad not only on the human level and in the natural world but also on the divine plane, where the god of the sea allies himself with Greeks31 while local river gods support Trojans. Rather than stage one direct battle between gods of sea and stream, the poem builds to a kind of climax by featuring the wrath of each body of water or its divinity in separate but complementary engage- ments that also involve other elemental forces. In the battle by the ships in Books 13 and 14, Poseidon angrily leads the Greeks against an otherwise 30 The Iliad applies the adjective enemoeis almost exclusively to Troy and does so repeatedly: //. 3.305,8.499,12.115,13.724,18.174,23.64,297; cf. 22.145. For an exploration of the thematic association of blowing winds with Hector's attacks, see Whitman 1958,147-51. 31 Poseidon's support of the Greeks in the Trojan War might be explained not only by the presence of his grandson Amphimachus on their side but also in terms of Greek piety (//. 8.203-4) and Trojan perfidy, since the former king Laomedon once cheated and even threatened the god (21.441-60). The alliance of the sea with Greeks and rivers with Trojans is of course not absolute. Even Poseidon resents the impious rivalry of the Greek fortification with the walls of Troy, which he himself built (7.448-63), and he deliberately rescues pious Aeneas and through him the Trojan race (20.290-339).</page><page sequence="18">492 JONATHAN FENNO unstoppable Hector and the Trojans but is himself sent back into the sea by order of Zeus. Here a kind of elemental conflict will be suggested between the sea with its waves and the sky with its wind, lightning, and driving precipitation. Later in the river fight in Book 21, the seething Xanthus, allied with the Simois, threatens to drown a nearly invincible Achilles, only to be turned back by Hephaestus. This battle of the ele? ments is embodied by water and fire. Much as the sea rises and fails in trying to defend Greeks, so, too, will rivers flood and recede in an at? tempt to protect Trojans. Poseidon's stealthy intervention in Book 13 has been subtly pre- saged at least as early as Book 4, where, as we have seen, a simile had animated the sea's waves as if they were marching soldiers (4.422-28). The narrative has also built an increasing tension between the god of the sea, whose impulse is to aid the Greeks, and the sky god, whose plan to glorify Achilles leads him to support the Trojans for much of the Iliad. In Book 8, for instance, when Zeus first left Olympus to oversee from Mount Ida the Trojan advance, Hera had unsuccessfully attempted to incite Poseidon (8.201-7), but he preferred to avoid direct insubordina- tion, at least for the moment. In this passage Hera explicitly contrasted Helice and Aegae, where Poseidon receives offerings from Greeks (as god of the sea), with Ida where Zeus is worshiped by Trojans as a kind of sky and weather god.32 As Zeus supervises the war from atop Ida (8.47, 11.183), the thunder, lightning, and wind that repeatedly emanate from the mountain in the direction of the Greek ships are interpreted by both sides as portending Trojan success in battle (8.75-77, 170-71, 175-76; 12.252-57).33 In general, a rainbow may be seen as a Zeus-sent portent of war or stormy precipitation (xepccc, ?|i|i?voci f\ 7io^ejioio / r\ kou xeijicovoc,, 17.548-49), and lightning is a sign that Zeus is preparing either war or else torrential rain, hail, or snow (10.5-8). Thus the Iliadic imagination explicitly conceives of battle as symbolically parallel to Zeus' precipitation. The opposition between the god of the sea and the god of the sky 32 For the Trojan cult of Idaean Zeus, cf. //. 4.44-49, 8.47-48, 16.604-5, 22.170-72, 24.287-91. Zeus is repeatedly invoked in prayer, by both Greeks and Trojans, as ruling from Mount Ida: 3.276 = 3.320 = 7.202 = 24.308; cf. 24.290-91. Zeus' rain feeds the numerous streams arising from Ida (12.19-26), which is formulaically distinguished as "full of springs." The adjective polypidax is applied exclusively to Mount Ida in the Iliad, occurring eight times in two separate formulae (e.g., 8.47, 14.157), and pideeis, with similar meaning, appears once, also modifying Ida (11.183). 33 Throughout the Iliad, rain sent by Zeus causes the destructive rush of rivers toward the sea (//. 5.91,11.493,12.25,16.386).</page><page sequence="19">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 493 will be represented in a complex simile that transforms weather from the sky?precipitation?into a weapon that is checked by the sea in a sort of battle of the elements. As the Trojans have driven the Greeks from the field of battle and prepare to overwhelm their wall, the stones thrown by both sides fly as thickly as snowflakes (12.278-87): . . . cog xe vtcpdSeq %i6vo&lt;; 7i(7cxcooi Gapxiai fjuxxTt %?iu?pi(p, oxe x' wp8xo \ir\xieza Zebq 280 vtcpefiev dvGpamoiai 7U(pat&gt;oK6u?vo&lt;; xa a KfjA,a- Kotjifjaac; 5' dv?jioi)&lt;; %??i eujceSov, ocppa KaXv\\fr\ i)\|/r|XcGV opecov Kopucpdc; Kai rcpcbovaq otKpoix; Kai 7i?5ia taoxouvxa Kai dv5pa&gt;v rciova epya, Kai x' ?(p' dA,6&lt;; noXiriq K?%Dxai Xijjioiv x?

As flakes of snow fall thick On a wintry day, when Zeus the counselor has roused himself To snow, which he reveals to mortal men as his own arrows, Calming the winds and pouring forth snow without pause, so as to cover The lofty mountains' peaks and high promontories And the lotus-covered plains and rich fields of men, And snow has been poured forth upon the gray sea's harbors and shores, But the wave comes up and holds it back, while everything else Is blanketed from above, when Zeus' storm falls down heavily, In this way from both sides the stones kept flying thick. In this simile falling snowflakes are not simply compared to missiles, they are also identified as Zeus' arrows (7U(pa\)OK6|i?vo&lt;; xa a Kfjtax, 280). If waves can be transfigured as helmets and streams as shields and spears, then precipitation can also become missiles. Although the comparison pivots formally upon the final point, that both sides threw stones as thickly as snowflakes, nevertheless the evocative value of the entire passage extends beyond this detail. Just as significant here, if not more so, is the larger picture painted over the general setting: with Zeus' blessing, the Trojans have driven the increasingly desperate Greeks back to their ships, while Poseidon has refrained from intervening. At this stage of the plot, the growing layer of snow, covering everything from mountaintops to plains to harbors and coasts, occupies the same space as advancing Trojans, and Greeks resist by the shore in the same place where the wave</page><page sequence="20">494 JONATHAN FENNO comes up and "holds back" snow (id)|ia 8e \xxv npoanXd^ov epuKexou, 285). Landscape is thus drawn into action, and action into landscape. Here the sea's role as combatant is relatively understated, but soon the situation will become much more critical when Zeus provides decisive support for the Trojans by rousing his son Sarpedon against the Greeks (290-93). Then, as they pour past the Greek wall, the narrator redeploys the verb eruko, which in the aforementioned simile indicated the sea's holding back snow, to announce dramatically that only a god could have "held back" Hector (epuKocicev, 465).34 This is the cue, so to speak, for Poseidon's entrance within a few verses. At the beginning of Book 13, when Zeus, enthroned atop Mount Ida, diverts his gaze and all the other gods abstain from battle, Poseidon drives his chariot over the waves toward Troy as beasts of the deep sport around their lord and the sea parts with joy (yrjGoGiJvri, 13.29). This elaborate scene, where the teeming sea seems to come alive, focuses our attention on its god. In the battle by the ships, Poseidon repeatedly comes out of the salty sea (13.15, 44, 352), assumes human likeness (13.45, 216, 357; 14.136), and instills menos, "force" or "rage," into the Greeks (13.59-61,14.151-52). Already indignant at Zeus for the success- ful Trojan advance (13.16, cf. 353), the sea god becomes exceedingly angry in his heart when Hector kills his grandson Amphimachus (nepi Kfjpi... exotaoGr], 206). To mark the high point in this stage of the battle, Poseidon shouts with the might of ten thousand as he rushes or surges across the plain (e7i;?OG\)|aevo(;, 14.147). Poseidon's bold manifestation of divinity does not escape the no- tice of Hera, who devises a plan to seduce Zeus so that after their lovemaking he will be overcome by sleep (14.153-65), which will allow the sea god to join battle more decisively (352-60). To obtain the magical girdle of Aphrodite and then again to disarm Zeus' suspicions, Hera deceitfully claims that she intends to visit Oceanus and Tethys, the par? ents of the gods ('Qiceccvov xe, Oefiv yeveoiv, koci (irjxepa Tr|0t)v, 201 = 302). Her alleged purpose in going is to persuade the couple to return to their long-abandoned marriage bed, as they are engaged in unresolved 34 At //. 12.465 some manuscripts have epuraicoi. Iliadic usage of the verb eruko, "to hold back," supports my general association of the Trojan advance with the encroaching snow (and Zeus) and the Greek position with the sea (and Poseidon). Just as in this simile snow is restrained by the sea's wave (12.285), so are Hector and the Trojans repeatedly restrained by the Greeks and their walls (8.178,10.161,12.465,15.297, cf. 16.369), and so, suggests Hera, might Zeus be restrained by Poseidon and other gods allied with Greeks (8.206).</page><page sequence="21">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 495 or endless quarrels (oucpixa veiKea, 205=304), and bitter anger has beset their heart (%6Xo&lt;; eiimoe Gujucg, 207 = 306).35 In this episode the god Sleep likewise calls Oceanus the origin or genesis of all the gods ('Qiceavou, bq nep yeveaxq rcavxeooi xexuKxai, 246). Sleep's rhetorical ref? erence to Oceanus, whom he names without any prompting from Hera, implies a remarkable respect second only to his regard for Zeus (since he might agree to lull to sleep even the former but never again the latter).36 Here (and again in an assembly of all the gods, as we shall see) the Iliad accords a special status to the primordial water god.37 With Sleep's help, Hera's irresistible attire and suggestive words produce the desired effect, not upon the original god of freshwater but rather upon Zeus, who surrounds her with a cloud atop Mount Ida and sheds drops of dew before losing consciousness. The deception of Zeus, then, represents more than an amusing interlude in the action since it also enables greater military intervention by the god of the sea. Moreover, this episode reveals traces of a cosmogony in which water is the primary element and the chief water god is involved in endless discord?significant details, I suggest, that enhance the hydropolemic themes found in the immediate context and throughout the Iliad. Accordingly I tentatively propose that the antagonism between Oceanus and Tethys, which is ironically emblematic of the marital strife between Zeus and Hera, may also be interpreted as a kind of archetype of elemental conflict in which water plays a significant role.38 Thus the 35 There is no reason to suppose that everything Hera says in her seduction of Zeus is a lie. Details such as the genealogy of the primordial pair, their guardianship of Hera, and their troubled relationship were presumably well known to Aphrodite and Zeus, thereby providing a credible foundation upon which the goddess of marriage could effectively construct her deception. Furthermore, even if a particular character seems to be portrayed as inventing a story, that very tale may have been borrowed by the poet from an earlier tradition. 36 In another rhetorical passage, Achilles points out that Zeus' thunderbolt is feared even by Achelous and even by Oceanus, from whom flow all rivers, seas, springs, and wells (//. 21.193-99). 37 Sleep further testifies to the cosmic significance of water when he asks Hera to swear by the water of the river Styx (//. 14.271-74), which is the greatest and most dreaded oath of the gods (//. 2.755, 15.37-38; Od. 5.185-86; Hes. Th. 400, 782-806). According to Hesiod the Olympians felt a special awe for the water of the Styx, who was the eldest daughter of Oceanus and Tethys (Hes. Th. 361-63, 389, 397-98, 775-77) and whose water made up one-tenth that of Oceanus (787-92). 38 Certain theoretical implications of identifying Oceanus and Tethys as the source of the gods caught the attention of ancient philosophers. Plato, for example, playfully associates the Homeric passage with Heraclitus' conception of the universe as existing in a</page><page sequence="22">496 JONATHAN FENNO bitter anger (kholos) that befalls their hearts also appears at times in the hearts of other gods, including Poseidon and Xanthus. Furthermore, it seems worthwhile to consider the possibility that the obscure theogony alluded to in the Iliad derives in part from much earlier Mesopotamian myth, where divinities of freshwater and saltwater engage in cosmic combat.39 Our earliest Greek sources clearly indicate that Oceanus was a kind of cosmic river, the male god of sweetwater.40 Evidence for the nature of his consort admittedly surfaces later, in Hellenistic literature, but there Tethys is closely identified with the sea.41 If this identification reflects her original essence, then the antithesis represented by Oceanus and Tethys would correspond to the opposition embodied by the Babylonian pair Apsu and Tiamat, god of freshwater and goddess of the salty sea, who are also the source of all other gods and quarrel with one another.42 Once Hera has lulled Zeus to sleep, Poseidon takes an even more constant state of flux, like a river (Cra. 402a-c; Tht. 152e, 180d), while Aristotle loosely connects it with Thales' notion that water was the first principle upon which the earth floated (Metaph. 983b20-32). The latter connection was made frequently in antiquity, e.g., Heracl. All. 22, which cites //. 14.246 in tracing Thales' treatment of water directly back to Homer. See Buffiere 1962,101, n. 8; Lamberton 1986, 252. 39 Water is admittedly of secondary importance in Hesiod's more famous Theogony (also influenced by ancient tales from the East) where the primordial pair is Uranus and Gaea, or Heaven and Earth. Rudhardt 1971, 24-33, 118-19, discerns in Hesiod a partially developed opposition between Oceanus as active, creative water and Pontos, the Deep Sea, as passive, obstructive water. 40 Oceanus is imagined as a river, potamos (II. 18.607; Od. 11.639, 12.1), character- ized especially by streaming water, rhoos, rheethra, etc. (//. 3.5, 7.422, 16.151, 18.240, 399; 21.195, 23.205; Od. 11.13, 19.434, 22.197, 24.11). On the Shield of Achilles, an encircling Oceanus can be distinguished from an interior sea (//. 18.483 and 607; cf. Hes. Sc. 207 and 314-15; also cf. Th. 790-91). Rivers like Oceanus may move in streams as well as waves (e.g., Od. 11.639), though the latter are more typical of the sea (cf. Od. 12.1-2). 41 Tethys is synonymous with the sea at least as early as Lyc. 1069 and commonly among Latin authors. 42 Oceanus and Tethys are primeval parents also in an hexameter poem identified by Plato as Orphic (Cra. 402bc). Among those who argue that the theme of primordial waters in both this text and the Iliad derives from a pre-existing cosmogony are Rudhart 1971, West 1983, 116-21, and Janko 1992, ad //. 14.200-207.

As Hec? tor arrays the Trojans, symmetrically poised against Poseidon and the Greeks, the very sea rises up in waves at the huts and ships (392-95): ?K^i)a0r| 8e Gdtaxoaa tcotI kXioioic, ze veaq xe 'Apyeicov oi 5e ^uviaav jieydtap dXaXr\xcb. oike QaXaoGr\c; K\)jxa xooov [3oda 7toxi %epaov, 395 7iovx60?v opvujievov 7ivoifi Bopeco dXeyEwfi ? The sea surged towards the huts and the ships Of the Argives. And the two sides joined together with a mighty cry. Not so loudly does the sea's wave shout against dry land, Raised up from all sides by the harsh blast of the North Wind. In this remarkable passage, superfluous to the narrative but essential to its poetic effect, Poseidon's anthropomorphic epiphany is accompanied by a sympathetic manifestation of his natural element.43 The animation is intensified by the subsequent simile from nature, which includes a personification of water of the type admired by Aristotle. As the two sides clash, the battle cry is said to be louder than when the sea's wave "shouts" against the shore (podoc, 394; cf. poocooiv, 17.265). When the battle turns in favor of the Greeks, Poseidon receives the credit (14.510). But as Zeus awakens in Book 15 to see the Trojans being routed by Poseidon and the Greeks, he sends Iris with a message that his brother should withdraw and either join the gods or recede into the sea. Iris flies down from Mount Ida to Poseidon as swiftly as hail or snow driven by the wind (15.169-72). Once again the sky god extends his will across the land in the manner of precipitation (likewise, rain-flooded rivers will express Zeus' stern judgment in the simile at 16.384-92). In angry frus- tration, Poseidon insists that his fated realm of the sea is equal in honor to the allotments of heaven and darkness received by his brothers Zeus and Hades (15.185-99,208-10). Before descending into the sea, he threat? ens bitter anger that cannot be placated (dvf|K8aioc, xoJtoc,, 217) and hints at a larger rebellion if Zeus should try to prevent the eventual fall of Troy. 43 See Whitman 1958,146^7, and Janko 1992, ad //. 14.392-401.</page><page sequence="24">498 JONATHAN FENNO XANTHUS AGAINST ACHILLES Poseidon's battle against Hector by the ships will be complemented by Xanthus' attack on Achilles in the river. Forecast as early as Book 2, the river fight represents the confluence of various hydropolemic themes (as illustrated above): the pathetic death of Trojans affiliated with fresh- water, the hydrokinetic sound and motion of Trojans, and extended com- parisons of warriors to rivers. In the river fight, Trojans are no longer simply associated with streams; rivers will also act as anthropomorphic warriors, not metaphorically in relatively brief natural similes but liter- ally in a lengthy theomachy.44 The crucial intervention of Xanthus in Book 21 was clearly signaled at the beginning of the previous book, when Zeus permitted the assembled gods to assist their favorites since he realized that otherwise Achilles would be unstoppable (20.26-27). Following this cue, the divine cast took up position on the wings, includ? ing Xanthus among those supporting the Trojans (40). But before turn- ing to the actual hydromachy, let us consider more closely the preceding assembly, where Xanthus made an anonymous appearance among the river gods. The plenary divine assembly at the beginning of Book 20 confirms the active involvement of water gods in the Trojan War.45 As mortals array themselves for battle?Greeks by the shore, Trojans on the sloping plain?Zeus convenes an assembly on Olympus (20.1-6). Although divin? ities are summoned from every where (ndvxr\, 5), the narrator does not attempt to name each one that attends. Instead the introductory roll call pays particular attention to gods of freshwater and saltwater: all rivers come, apart from Oceanus, as do all nymphs of groves and rivers' springs and grassy meadows (7-12); Poseidon, too, joins them from the sea (13- 18). Instead of noticing the prominence of water as the assembly gathers, readers have long puzzled over certain details, such as the unexplained absence of Oceanus and the unsolicited initiative of Poseidon, the first god to speak. The scholiasts, for instance, sought to rationalize Poseidon's conspicuousness by referring to his relationship with Zeus. But in my reading of the Iliad, the sea god, supporter of the Greeks, naturally balances the aforementioned freshwater divinities. Furthermore, the very 44 For a different interpretation, see Mills 2002,55-93. Exploring the mythical theme of the hero battling watery chaos, Mills interprets the fight between Achilles and the river as a surreal reflection of the warrior's own psychological turmoil. 45 For the divine assembly in Book 20 as a coherent part of the Iliad, see Scheibner 1939,21-25,65-71.</page><page sequence="25">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 499 appearance of river gods, spring nymphs, and the like at an assembly on Olympus has been treated by some scholars as an incongruous and superfluous interpolation. Their presence, however, prefigures the signifi? cant role played later by local river gods.46 The sole absence of Oceanus, brought to our notice but left unex- plained, naturally invites speculation.47 The common hypothesis that his supposedly impersonal function as primordial source of all waters is somehow inconsistent with an appearance on Olympus in the heroic age leaves certain difficulties unresolved: other rivers managed to leave their streams to attend, and the absence of other cosmic divinities is not mentioned. Since the Iliad sometimes presents Oceanus in anthropo- morphic terms, capable of refusing to go to bed with his wife, we may reasonably imagine that he might also be able to go to assembly, if he so wished.48 Perhaps his absence can be better explained not by arbitrarily imposing physical limitations on this one god but rather by looking for clues in the mythical background. Oceanus' angry quarrels with Tethys (and perhaps other gods as well), referred to earlier in the poem as if part of a familiar cosmogonic tale, may have motivated his abstention not only from intercourse with her but also from congress with other divinities. Within the plot of the Iliad, an instructive parallel for Oceanus' absence on Olympus can conceivably be found in Achilles' refusal to go either to assembly or into battle (1.490-91), also motivated by resent- ment. In any case, even if this episode does not overtly mention the wrath of the primordial water god, it still draws our attention once again to the importance of Oceanus. After the assembly on Olympus, the poem's presentation of the impending theomachy balances saltwater and freshwater in various ways. As the first two divinities take up position, each will make a symmetrical 46 The narrator's attention to waters at the beginning of this assembly may reflect a type of Mesopotamian or Near Eastern divine assembly. One might compare the general setting of this Olympic assembly to the one that takes place in the Ugaritic myth of Baal on Mount Zaphon in northern Syria, specifically located at the source of the two rivers, amidst the source of the two deeps. For a convenient translation, see Pritchard 1969,129-42. 47 Rudhardt 1971, 102, observes that in the Iliad the primordial gods of water have ceded their power to younger divinities and live at a remote distance, no longer reproduc- ing or participating in wars and assemblies. 48 On the Franc,ois Vase, at any rate, the fact that Oceanus accompanies the gods at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis suggests that no generally accepted principle prevented his participation in divine affairs. Also in Prometheus Bound, Oceanus and his daughters venture to leave their streams and underwater caves to visit the distant mountain peak to which the Titan has been chained, despite the risk of thereby incurring Zeus' wrath.</page><page sequence="26">500 JONATHAN FENNO epiphany near the appropriate body of water. Athena cries aloud at the Greek trench and the deep-sounding shores of the sea (20.48-50), while Ares, shouting against her, calls the Trojans from the high citadel and runs along the river Simois (51-53). The sound and motion of god and water blend together. The battle will take place on three levels simulta- neously: human, natural, and divine. Trojans confront Greeks, the Troad's rivers flow toward the sea, and two martial divinities face one another. Among the other gods, it is true, various oppositions emerge: Poseidon is matched against Apollo, not Xanthus, who is opposed by Hephaestus (67-74). The god of the sea will provide relatively limited support to Achilles against the river, offering him a hand and encouraging advice (21.284-97). According to an ancient treatise on the allegorical interpre- tation of Homer, which was attributed to a certain Heraclitus (All. 56, 58), the eventual clash between Xanthus and Hephaestus (//. 20.73, cf. 21.328-84) represents the watery element succumbing to fire, while the subsequent encounter between Poseidon and Apollo (20.67-68, cf. 21.435- 69) symbolizes the sun yielding to the sea.49 This kind of overt physical allegory can be traced back at least to the last quarter of the sixth century, when Theagenes of Rhegium wrote a book, now lost, on Homer. The ancient source that mentions Theagenes' work (8.2 Diels-Kranz = Porph. ad //. 20.67) refers to various natural elements and human dis- 49 The allegorist Heraclitus resisted the notion of water as the oldest substance in favor of the theory that Homer recognized four basic elements, as is evident in his discus? sion of the Old Man of the Sea (All. 67, cf. 23), a familiar figure in early Greek myth, even if his precise identity was variable (e.g., Nereus //. 18.36, Od. 24.58; Proteus Od. 4.349; Phorcys Od. 13.96). Pace Heraclitus, the ability of this ancient water god to change into all other shapes and substances (e.g., Od. 4.417-18) is at least consistent with the theory that water is the primordial element. One of the Orphic hymns invokes Proteus as the first-born god (7ipcGToy?vfj), through whose manifold metamorphoses primordial nature first (7ipcbxrj) devised everything (25.2-3,9); while another hymn identifies Nereus as the first principle of all things (23.4). The Nereid Thetis, like her father, is known for shifting shape, a motif which is first attested in literature by Pindar (Nem. 4.62-64) but appears in the visual arts as early as 630 b.c.e. (See Vollkommer 1994, 268, figs. 78, 91). Thetis also came to be identified as a primordial divinity, apparently a kind of creator goddess. In the scholia ad //. 1.399-406 (bT), a Homeric theomachy is interpreted in cosmological terms: Poseidon, for example, is associated with water and Thetis with the arrangement (deaiq) and nature of everything. Likewise, a scholium ad Lyc. 22 attributes to Thetis the ordered condition of the cosmos (?\)9eaia). And an allegorical commentary on a lost poem by Alcman (fr. 5.15-19 P.M.G. = P. Oxy. 2390) places Thetis at the very beginning of the cosmos and seems to make her a kind of demiurge (Most 1987 persuasively argues that Thetis owes her allegorical treatment here not to Alcman but rather to the commentator). For the cosmic status of Thetis, Nereus, and Proteus, see Vernant 1970, 40-43. For the cultic importance of Thetis and the Nereids, see Slatkin 1991, 80-84, and Hdt. 7.191; Paus. 2.1.8, 3.14.4-6, 3.26.7.</page><page sequence="27">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 501 positions but focuses first and foremost on the conflict between what is dry and wet, explaining that fire (associated with Hephaestus, Helius, and Apollo) can dry up water (associated with Scamander and Poseidon), while water can extinguish fire.50 The two water gods, however, should not simply be equated with one another. In fact the great theomachy includes two distinct types of water, each with its own symbolic signifi? cance: the unsuccessful protector of the doomed Trojans, a humbled river; and the champion of the Greeks, a sea god accorded considerable respect. The battle amongst the gods, initiated by Xanthus, is actually prompted by Achilles' fight in, by, and even against the river. As the Greek hero slaughters Trojans in the Scamander, mocking their useless worship of its god (21.128-35), the river assumes a personality, becomes even more bitterly angry in his heart (noxa[ibq 8e xotaooocxo KrjpoOi [laXkov, 136), and ponders in his mind how to stop the massacre. Provoked to bitter anger by so many dead youths in his streams (k?%6?udto, 146), the god instills menos into the Trojan ally Asteropaeus (145), grandson of a river. But even he fails before Achilles, who again belittles worshippers and descendants of rivers (184-99). As great-grandson of almighty Zeus, to whom even Achelous and Oceanus must yield, Achilles claims superi- ority over a river's grandson.51 But he in turn will soon meet his match in an immortal son of Zeus, Xanthus, who, had he been so inclined, might have inverted Achilles' argument, claiming ascendancy over the son of a mere sea goddess.52 Now the vexed river itself rises against the Greek hero, temporarily taking the form of a man (213). Xanthus tells Achilles to slay the Trojans on land, not in his waters, since he can no longer pour forth his stream into the sea, blocked as it is by corpses. When Achilles 50Plutarch, similarly contrasting cold/water and warm/fire, observes that Homer arranges confrontations between the river and Hephaestus and between Poseidon and Apollo (14.950e). 51 Achilles' reference to Oceanus' fear of Zeus' thunderbolt (//. 21.198) both recalls Poseidon's submission to his brother in Book 15 and foreshadows Xanthus' capitulation before Hephaestus' flames later in Book 21. One might also compare Zeus' use of lightning against the river Asopus, which reportedly still had coal in its stream in Apollodorus' day (Apollod. 3.12.6; cf. Call. Del. 77-78, Stat. Theb. 7.320-27). Nagler 1974,147-55, argues that the river fight can be understood not only as a combat myth but also as a parallel to Mesopotamian flood stories. Nagler (154) identifies a certain "polarization" of terrestrial waters and the sea in this episode, in that Poseidon will grant Achilles some support against the river and Hera will rouse winds from the salty sea to fan Hephaestus' flames. 52 Earlier, Apollo, disguised as a Trojan prince, had urged Aeneas to confront Achil? les, pointing out that Achilles' mother, daughter of the Old Man of the Sea, is inferior to Aeneas' mother, Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus (//. 20.105-7).</page><page sequence="28">502 JONATHAN FENNO continues his onslaught, the river noisily surges or rushes upon him (?7180-0-1)1:0, 234). The same verb had also described Poseidon rushing noisily across the plain in the battle by the ships. Other actions of Xanthus here also correspond to the earlier behavior of Poseidon: assuming hu? man likeness, the sea god granted menos to the Greeks, and already upset by Trojan success, he became especially angry when his grandson was killed by Hector. The anthropomorphic river protects the Trojans under his streams (odco koctoc Koka p??0poc, 21.238) as if he were a warrior shielding his comrades. Then he forces Achilles back by falling upon that hero's shield (odGei 8' ?v o-(XK?i 7ii7cxcov poo&lt;;, 241), not unlike the mountain streams in the first river simile that had thrust together their mighty water (4.453). When Achilles is finally turned to flight, the raging river streams after him with a loud rumbling (p?cov ... |i?ydXcp 6p\)jiaY8cp, 21.256). Much as other rampaging individuals had earlier been likened to swollen streams, so here even Xanthus (a river god playing the role of warrior) will be indirectly compared to rushing water in similes that almost redundantly intensify the hydropolemic theme. One simile compares Achilles, about to be drowned by the river god, to a gardener unable to keep pace with the flow of irrigation water (257-64), and another likens him to a boy swept away by a flooded torrent (281-83). As the river attacks, he does not lessen his menos but rather becomes even more bitterly angry (hi \iakXov I %co?xo, 305-6). The surging stream equips its wave with a crest, or rather a crested helmet (Kop\)aa?, 306), reminiscent of the anthropo? morphic sea that had earlier crested when Greeks first advanced on Trojans (4.424). Xanthus calls for assistance with a shout to Simois (k?k^?t' avoaq, 21.307), just as mighty Hector had regularly called upon the Trojans (?K?K?i?xo jnocKpov avoaq, 6.110 = 8.172 = 15.346; cf. 20.364-65). The river urges his brother to fill his streams from springs and create a great rumbling (noXbv 8' 6p\)jiay86v, 21.313). But Hephaestus intervenes, boiling the unleashed waters with fire, until Xanthus stops the flow of his stream and capitulates. Only when his waters are subdued by immortal fire does Xanthus finally bring his menos under control (383). By swear- ing to refrain from battle and not to intervene in the future, even when the city is consumed by fire (373-76), the scorched stream both prefigures and foretells the fiery destruction of Troy. In spite of its rivers, the Trojan city will be burned to the ground. In conclusion, hydropolemic imagery supplies the action of the Iliad a measure of unity. Both in assembly and in battle, the sound and motion of Greeks and Trojans are often figuratively associated with bodies of</page><page sequence="29">WATER IMAGERY IN ILIADIC BATTLE SCENES 503 water, the former primarily with the sea, the latter with rivers. Similes that compare soldiers to waves or streams are sometimes intensified by the animation of bodies of water that begin to behave as if they were living warriors. Such imagery culminates in counterbalanced hydromachies where the god of the sea takes human shape to assist Greeks against Hector and an anthropomorphic river god protects Trojans from Achil? les. The fundamental opposition of saltwater and freshwater may even be represented in cosmic terms by endless quarrels between Tethys and Oceanus, origin of all gods and all waters. Thus, on the divine level, sea and stream seemingly act as paradigmatic symbols of conflict in general and the Trojan War in particular. In an illustrative prolepsis at the begin? ning of Book 12, when the Greeks have finally sailed homeward across the sea, water will play a decisive role in obliterating their camp (12.1- 35). In fact, divinities from both sides will join forces to remove traces of its presence: Apollo will divert against it the mouths of all Mount Ida's streams filled with rain from Zeus (24-26); Poseidon will wash it away with waves and restore the Troad's rivers to their former channels (27- 33).53 This hydraulic cooperation represents not only a natural restora- tion of the local watershed and shoreline but also a kind of divine peace. Since the Iliad often employs hydropolemic imagery, the war's final end is also fittingly effected by hydrodynamic divinities. The hydropolemic imagery employed repeatedly in the Iliad is carried through even to the war's restorative ending, an ending accomplished by a concerted effort of hydrodynamic divinities.54 University of Mississippi, Oxford e-mail: jfenno@olemiss.edu 53 For arguments that the construction of the Achaean wall in Book 7 and its foreseen obliteration in Book 12 form part of the plan of the Iliad, see Ford 1992,147-54; Webster 1964,252, and n. 4. Scodel 1982 sees the wall's destruction as a sort of deluge myth. West 1997,377-80, suggests a connection to historical sieges in the Near East that report- edly involved diverted streams. Within Greek myth one might loosely compare Heracles' diversion of rivers to clean the Augean stables (e.g., Apollod. 2.5.5). Heracles is the kind of hero who overcomes various water creatures associated with rivers, marshes, lakes, and the sea, and his conquest of the mighty Achelous river may serve as a rough parallel to Achilles' fight against the Scamander. 54 This article is an expanded version of a paper delivered on April 5, 2003, at the annual meeting of the Classical Association of the Mid-West and South in Lexington, Kentucky.
