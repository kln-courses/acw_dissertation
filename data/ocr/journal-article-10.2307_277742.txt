<plain_text><page sequence="1">DZIBILCHALTON, YUCATAN, MEXICO: STRUCTURES 384, 385, AND 386: A PRELIMINARY INTERPRETATION W. J. FOLAN ABSTRACT The excavation of Structures 384, 385, and 386, and their associated platform in Dzibilchaltfin, Yucatan, revealed an occupational sequence from late Phase I or early Phase II of the Early period up to and including the early Colonial period. The ceramic material analyzed pertains primarily to the Copo complex and, when com- bined with the architectural data and with 16th-century descriptions of Maya culture, made it possible to infer or suggest the use and function of each room within each building associated with the group and its lineage asso- ciations from its conception to the present. This analysis indicates that, although the primary function of the group was ceremonial during the early stages of occupation, all but one of the structures were later used more for domes- tic than ceremonial ends, until the vaults collapsed during the late Pure Florescent subperiod. During the later Decadent period, however, one of the earliest buildings was tunneled into and reused for ceremonial functions, possibly even after the 16th-century Spanish open chapel was erected less than 200 m. away in the central plaza of Dzibilchaltin. NE OF THE projects chosen by the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e His- toria for the 1961-62 program at Dzibilchaltuin was the excavation, consolidation, and partial reconstruction of a group of buildings located along the northern limit of the central plaza. Although two of the structures (38 and 38-sub) forming this group had been excavated earlier by W. J. Folan, under the supervision of E. W. Andrews of the Middle American Research In- stitute, three unexcavated buildings (384, 385, and 386) sharing a common platform had not been investigated. A large, rectangular, multi- zoned building (37) facing the central plaza forms the southern limit of the platform and sacbe #8 parallels its western limit (Fig. 1). This excavation was to link Structures 38 and 38-sub stratigraphically and functionally with Structures 384, 385, 386, and 37. The excavation of Structure 38 revealed two major construction periods, and later innovations during the Deca- dent and, possibly, the early Colonial pe- riods. The earliest structure (38-sub) is a small, rectangular, vaulted building constructed during late Phase I or early Phase II of the Early period, which later served as part of the fill for the con- struction of a multizoned, Pure Florescent building (38) raised over it. After the super- structure of the Florescent period building had collapsed, a trench was dug through its base and into the earlier building (38-sub) below it; the fill was removed from the interior, and it was reused for ceremonial purposes, possibly even after the arrival of the Spanish (Andrews 1962: 153-4, Fig. 3). Structures 384 and 385, whose construction is coeval with 38-sub, also, pro- duced a stratigraphic record from late Phase I or the early part of Phase II of the Early period up to and including the Transitional Black-on- cream period. The excavation of Structure 386 revealed an almost completely leveled and quar- ried Pure Florescent vaulted building. Once the stratigraphic record had been ob- tained, sufficient data were available to produce valid inferences regarding the use and function through time of each room in each structure, of each building, and of the entire group as a whole. Unfortunately ,it was not possible to com- plete this study. Although this factor has lim- ited the original scope and principal purpose of this paper, enough information is available from the excavation record to partially fulfill the interpretive task originally embarked upon. It should be noted, however, that a more complete examination of the data may contradict some of the more conjectural statements made in the following analysis. EXCAVATION THE PLATFORM Before excavation the platform was a low mound of fallen masonry mixed with general debris (Fig. 2). The only visible standing archi- tecture was the northwest corer. After exca- vation it was evident that the north and south platform walls had collapsed almost totally, but, fortunately, the west side was relatively com- plete due to the support provided by sacbe #8. The final shape of the platform is the result of a combination of constructions: a primary struc- ture corresponding in time to the erection of Structures 38-sub, 384, and 385; a secondary addition coeval with the construction of Struc. tures 38 and 386; and the last addition, which is an extension added to the west side of both the primary and secondary platforms with an access ramp and steps abutting its south side. It is probable, for reasons to be stated later, that the construction of Structure 37 took place at 434</page><page sequence="2">DZIBILCHALTON i~~~~~~~~~~~~i ~~~~~~~~~r---~= oo,~~~~5 : i I oo o ..........

The north side of the group before excavation. The vaulted structure in the background is 38-sub, reconstructed by the Middle American Research Institute. The earliest platform was constructed by stacking broken stones from its center toward its exterior limits. Once the height of the fill reached the desired elevation of the platform in all areas except the periphery, the platform walls were built. Large, flat slabs of stones were laid on end to form the base of the wall, and above them coursing was common when the shape of the base stones permitted it. Above the base the walls were of block masonry, with spalls but without mortar. As the height of the walls increased, the area between the platform fill and the back of the wall was filled with stones somewhat smaller than those forming the major percentage of the platform. No stucco was observed on any of the platform walls, all of which were constructed with a slight positive batter. After excavation, the second and last platform additions were consolidated and com- pletely reconstructed (Fig. 3). Crypt M1264 This crypt was formed in the center of the original platform, postdating its construction and the extension of its latest floor (Fig. 4). Its rectangular shape, formed on the sides and top by roughly worked blocks and sheets of lime- stone, is typical of several Florescent period crypts in Dzibilchaltuin. The skeleton was in an extended position with the skull oriented to- ward the east. This and other crypts excavated in 1961-62 are no larger than is necessary to con- tain the body placed inside them, suggesting that each was formed for a particular individual as are the wooden coffins made by the contempo- rary Maya. An inverted plate (M1264-1) cov- ered the s k u ll, a n d a hemispherical bowl (M1264-2) was located on the south side of the thorax. A broken and incomplete three-legged plate (M1264-3) was scattered about the in- terior (Fig. 5). A Mayapan or Post-Conquest Feature After the collapse of all the vaulted structures on the primary and secondary platforms, a large, oval feature made of a single row of unworked and reused building stones one course high was formed in the center of the primary platform (Fig. 1). Although nothing was uncovered to indicate its function, local workers suggested that it might have served as a base for a wall constructed of perishable materials.

STRUCTURES 38-SUB AND 38 Structures 38-sub, 384, and 385 were erected after the completion of the primary platform. Structure 38-sub was the smallest and least complex of the structures excavated in Dzibil- chaltun by the Middle American Research In- stitute prior to 1960 (Fig. 6). Because of this and other factors soon to be published by An- drews, it may represent one of the earliest vaulted structures built at the site. The vaulted superstructure of this building was consolidated and completely reconstructed by Tulane Univer- sity in 1960 (Andrews 1961: 11-13, Fig. 7; 1962: 153-4, Fig. 3). Structure 38 was also excavated, completely consolidated, and partially reconstructed by the Middle American Research Institute. Dur- ing the 1961-62 program, however, the second zone of the south side of the building was added to demonstrate more clearly that this structure was built over and, therefore, postdates 38-sub (Fig. 6). STRUCTURE 385 Before excavation this building was repre- sented by a low mound of fallen masonry mixed with wind-blown dirt and decayed flora. A small section of the north wall and of the top of the central wall was the only visible standing masonry. Structure 385 is a vaulted, rectangular build- ing with five rooms (Figs. 7 and 8). Its masonry is block type similar to that of 38-sub. The stones were joined with liberal quantities of cancab (mud mortar), but the placement of the spalls was often accompanied by lime mortar. Al- though little care was taken to shape the wall stones, the comer and jamb stones were roughly squared as were the faces of the cornices, and the vault spring stones were worked into a crude wedge shape. The vault caps were rectangular, but the other stones used in the construction of 437 FOLAN ]</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY V oi . .o-' _d,l ,o1o40 FIG. 4. Crypt M1264, located in the center of the patio. An inverted plate, M1264-1, covers the skull; a hemis- pherical bowl, M1264-2, is located next to the thorax; and an incomplete plate, M1264-3, is located above the left shoulder. The skull is oriented toward the east, and the skeleton has been reconstructed. Drawing by Jean Brath- waite. the vault were unworked slabs of limestone larger than, but closely resembling, those asso- ciated with the vault of 38-sub. Because stone lintels were not found, it is assumed that wood- en beams supported the masonry above the doorways. No evidence was noted to indicate that the outside walls of the building were stuccoed. Although the wall dividing the north room of the structure, the wall blocking the doorway connecting the north and south rooms, the step added to the outside entrance to the west room, and the wall blocking the outside eastern en- trance to the south room are postconstruction modifications to the original building plan, the primary architectural plan of the building was changed during construction. This change i s manifested by the beginning of a door jamb con- structed on a fragment of cancab floor near the eastern end of the central dividing wall. Four Florescent decorative elements were un- covered in the rubble on the north side of the structure to the west of the entrance to the northwest room. Because the same type of stones were associated, in a larger quantity, with the later Pure Florescent Structure 386, it can be inferred that these stones originally formed part of the decorated facade of 386 which had collapsed and that these stones had been dis- carded next to the partially collapsed Structure 385. Judging from the large quantity of dirt lo- cated against the base of the structure, little or no effort was expanded to maintain the area free of rubbish during the years preceding its collapse. While dismantling the standing masonry of Stucture 385 prior to its consolidation, a mason, Juan Chable Dzib, commented that he thought the building had been constructed on a mass production basis. After the building stones were shaped and assembled near the building site, a mason's helper spread the mortar while one or more masons fitted and plumbed the building stones. He further commented that another mason's helper drove in the spalls. This appears to be a reasonable inference because it is obvious from observing the standing masonry that enough mortar was spread at one time to acom- modate several stones which may have been placed by one or more masons working together as a team. Moreover, many of the spalls were driven in with lime instead of mud mortar, in- dicating that another individual using a different mortar was occupied by this task. West Room After the construction of the west room, the inner walls and the floor were finished with a layer of stucco. At a later date an opening was made in the original floor to form Crypt M1239. After two burials had been made in the crypt and several funerary objects placed with them, a new floor was laid and the walls of the room were restuccoed. Also, a wall-to-wall altar or bench was built at the north end of the room. A large area of the floor over the crypt showed definite signs that it had been discolored due to a fire hot enough to bur a small opening in the floor. At a later date the altar or bench was removed, with the exception of its base, and two stones were added to the sill of the outside door of the room before the third and last floor was P7 1? $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Zf A ) a c I, r Ii~~~~~~~~~~~ \\\\~ ~ // b pc 5 _10 5 20cm.

Crypt M1239 This crypt is larger and was constructed with more care than the others excavated in 1961-62 (Fig. 7a). The walls were made of large spalls and several large stone slabs joined with cancab mortar. The sides and floor were then finished with a layer of stucco 2 cm. thick. The large, flat stones covering the crypt were placed on top of the sides and sealed to them with cancab mortar and spalls. The spaces between the stones covering the crypt were also filled with the same material. Following this, a layer of roughly shaped stone slabs with a thick, flat rounded stone in the center was placed over the closed crypt. All of these stones were then cov- ered by a layer of smaller stones that formed the base of the secondary floor. The principal occupant of the crypt was found in an extended position oriented toward the north with an incomplete skull without facial bones. The tibia and fibula of the right leg appeared to have been pressed into the wet stucco forming the floor, and small stones rough- ly outlined the bones suggesting that this leg was fleshless below the knee prior to burial and that burial was made before the stucco had dried. The incomplete, disarticulated skeleton of an infant was found mixed with ashes in the area of the incomplete skull of the adult primary. The crypt contained 14 funerary objects (Fig. 9). An inverted, three-legged dish (M1239-10) with a chipped rim covered the pubic area, and various other ceramic objects (M1239-1 to M1239-9) were associated with the lower limbs. Several of these items had been broken before being placed in the crypt. The three supports of M1239-4 and -11 were broken off, and M1239-6 was missing a fragment which was found in the 0 1 2 3 4 M, FIG. 7. Structure 385. Crypts: a, M1239; b, M1237; c, M1243; d, M1244.

A whistle (M1239-8) in the form of a warrior, with a hole in his left arm and shoulder ornament so that it could be hung around the neck with a cord, had been partially dismantled before being placed in the crypt--his shield was removed, and the upper part of a sandal was broken from his left foot. Although the lat- ter fragments were located, a section of the neck ornament which had been removed was not re- covered during excavation. A ceramic represen- tation of the head of a mammal (M1239-9), which may be a lineage symbol, also provided with holes for use as a pendant, was located near the warrior whistle in the area of the principal occupant's lower phalanges rather than near the chest. This indicates that they did not form part of the occupant's costume when placed in the crypt but were "cast in" as described by Landa (1941: 130). The only items which may have been asso- ciated with the child burial were an upright, tri- pod plate with the supports broken off (M1239- 11), a jadite bead (M1239-12), an incrusted and filed tooth (M1239-13), and a possible rattle- snake fang (M1239-14). Of these items, jadite beads are commonly associated with child bur- ials - possibly to be used as money in the after- life (Landa 1941: 130) - but the others may be associated with the adult primary burial, except for the plate which contained part of the infant skeleton. It should be mentioned, however, that a child burial at San Jose was accompanied by an adult tooth with a hole bored through the base of the root (Thompson 1939: 194), and another possible rattle-snake fang (M1242-2) was associated with an infant in Ur Burial M1242 in the south room of Structure 385. This crypt and the offerings are the most elaborate of the burials excavated during the season, and they strongly indicate that the occu- pant was a comparatively important person. The whistle may also permit further classifica- tion of the individual as a warrior who carried it into battle (see Cogolludo 2, VI in Landa 1941: 49, n. 240). We cannot, however, with absolute certainty classify the burial as a male 440 [ VOL. 34, No. 4, 1969</page><page sequence="8">DZIBILCHALTON a. b c f e ,: - :XtA ;;:, .1 '.., ;: *I F = v 9 , . o ft A y II .l? ,-"-z' - k Q 5 10 15 20cm.

The missing face bones may have been removed before burial or may have merely de- cayed, as is common in Yucatan. The condition of the right leg could be due either to loss of the flesh before death or to decomposition while the corpse was stored until the crypt was com- pleted. Broken pottery associated with burials and offerings has been commonly classified as a form of sacrifice. Moreover, the disarticulated and incomplete skeleton may be a child sacrifice (Landa 1941: 116) in honor of the dead warrior. The disarticulated condition of this skeleton may be du o either to rodent action (although no evi- dence of this was noted), deterioration while the crypt was being constructed, or both. Bo.h the skeleton and the broken warrior whistle may give a clue as to why the adult occu- pant died. If the whistle represents a warrior, and, iherefore, it is assumed that the occupant of the crypt participated in military activities, the deliberate removal of the shield originally attached to the whistle figurine may indicate that he was wounded in battle and died as a result of his wounds. It may also be inferred that he was wounded in the right leg; not only were the tibia and fibula of this leg partially en- cased in the stucco bottom of the crypt (indi- cating that it was fleshless at the time of inter- ment, possibly due to an advanced case of gan- grene), but also the sandal element of the left foot of the accompanying figurine was removed deliberately. Although the right, and not the left, leg was fleshless at the time of burial, it is possible that an error was made during the rush to inter what may have been a badly decom- posed corpse. This may have occurred when the official holding the figurine to remove the appro- priate sandal element was facing the figurine with its left leg on his right side, thus causing the error of removing the wrong sandal element. The missing neck element could suggest that the warrior was also wounded in this section of the body. If the pendant is a lineage symbol in the form of a mammal head representing a deer (Maya ceh), it may be inferred that the warrior in Crypt M1239 was an important member of the Ceh lineage in Dzibilchaltuin, located in the Maya province of Ceh Pech, and, therefore, there is a strong possibility that he was not only a leading authority in Dzibilchaltuin but in the province as well. The South Room This room served as an antechamber prior to the erection of Structure 37 because it is inferred that the staircase providing access to the primary platform was located immediately in front of it. The room features three exterior and three interior entrances. As mentioned, architectural plans were changed during the construction of the wall dividing the north and south rooms. From all indications, at least one of the entries between the north and south rooms was to be located at the eastern end of the wall, but the pre-Columbian architect either decided or was instructed to place it in the center of the dividing wall. After the con- struction of the room, both the walls and floor were stuccoed, but the primary floor was broken through for no apparent reason, and both the floor and walls were restuccoed. The wall blocking the entrance between the north and south rooms was added to the structure later, and the secondary floor was broken through to provide space for Crypts M1237, M1243, Urn Burial M1242, and Cist Burials M1240 and M1241. After the crypts were occupied and the urn was placed between them, the third and last floor was laid, and, finally, the easternmost outside entrance was blocked. Because of the incompleteness and the deteriorated condition of the last floor, it is possible, however, that Crypt M1237 and the urn burial were formed after the last floor was laid and that they were sealed over with a stucco patch. The entire western end of the south room was covered by a midden, 50 cm. high, con- taining Urn Burial M1232 and a mixture of fine grey ash and broken pottery but with no traces of floral or faunal remains. The formation of the midden began before the last floor was laid in the west room, because the latter abuts the midden at the entrance between the two rooms - apparently intended to bring the floor level in the west room up to the level of the midden in the south room. At the eastern end of the south room, in the area between the two crypts, a large, trough-like metate (M1233-1) was perched on a pre-Florescent cornice stone. A miniature metate (M1230-1) was placed on a stone next to the eastern door jamb of the west- ern exterior entrance to the room, and another miniature metate was located on top of the par- tially collapsed wall blocking the interior en- trance between the south and north rooms. The location of the last metate may indicate that this 442 [ VOL. 34, No. 4,1969</page><page sequence="10">DZIBILCHALTON entrance was blocked only partially, thus leav- ing the ledge on which the metate was found and a space through which articles or conver- sation could pass from one room to another. Outside the room a walkway was built with pre-Florescent cornice and vault stones. This feature has a low and narrow stone wall form- ing its southern border, but no other archi- tectural features were found on the surface excavated between the border and the north wall of Structure 37. The level of the walk- way was approximately the same as the midden located at the western end of the south room and the last floor level of the patio formed by Structures 38, 384, 385, and 386. Crypts M1237 and M1243 The sides of Crypt M1237 were formed main- ly by unworked stones and the top by roughly shaped slabs of limestone (Fig. 7b). Like Crypt M1264 in the center of the platform, it gives the impression that its size was determined by the measurements of the individual occupying it. The skeleton was found in an extended posi- tion with the skull oriented toward the east. Once again, the facial bones were missing, and, moreover, the area around the knees was boxed in by two unworked stones. Two funerary objects accompanied the burial (Fig. 10c, d). An inverted plate (M1237-2) was placed over the skull, and an upright bowl (M1237-1) was placed over the knees with its bottom resting on the two stones mentioned above. Crypt M1243 was formed by the same type of stones and in the same shape as M1237 lo- cated to the west of it (Fig. 7c). The skeleton was in an extended position with the incom- plete skull oriented toward the east. An invert- ed plate (M1243-2) was placed over the skull, and a cylindrical vase (M1243-1) was located between the legs at a point below the knees (Fig. 10i, j). Both of these ceramic pieces were broken, but this may be due to the collapse of the vault instead of an intentional act. Urn Burials M1242 and M1232 Urn Burial M1242 (Fig. 7f) was composed of two urns which were located between and in line with the two crypts described above. At first it appeared that there was only one urn, but it was later discovered that there were two, both broken and the fragments mixed to- gether (Fig. 10g, h). The principal and most complete urn (M1242-1) contained the skeleton of an infant accompanied by eight small jadite beads (M1242-3) and a serpent fang (M1242-2). The um rim had been broken off and placed upside down in the bottom of the urn. The fragments of the second um (M1242-4) were located in the same area as the first and several fragments were found inside Crypt M1243 located to the east of it. No skeletal re- mains were associated with this urn. The open- ing in which both urns were placed was made by breaking through the previously laid floors and appeared to be sealed by a patch in the last floor in this room. Urn Burial M1232 may be the last one made in the south room (Fig. 7g). It is formed by an upright, striated urn (M1232-1) containing the skeleton of an infant (Fig. 10a). The neck of this urn had also been removed, possibly to wid- en the opening to facilitate the placement of the infant inside it. Thirteen unworked stones were found inside the urn on top of the burial, and the opening was covered by an upright, tripod plate with its supports broken off (M1232-2, Fig. 10b). This is an uncommon burial urn because striated wares are usually classified as domestic and also because it is unusual to find a burial um covered by an upright plate. Cist Burials M1240 and M1241 Cist Burial M1240 was placed in an opening made through the last floor (Fig. 7h). The skull of the occupant, an infant, was covered by an inverted, hemispherical bowl (M1240-1, Fig. 10e), and a small jadite bead (M1240-2) was found among the remains. An urrm (M1240-3), in an upright position in the midden formed on the last floor, was located above the cist burial (Fig. 10f). The burial was a primary one in a fetal position with the skull oriented toward the west. It was difficult, however, to be certain of the orientation of the skull because the sec- tions of the cranial vault were scattered, prob- ably due to the decomposition of the skull and to pressure from above. Cist Burial M1241 is represented by the in- complete skeleton of an infant placed on the surface of the earliest floor through an opening, sealed with a stucco patch, in the latest floor. Only a few pottery fragments accompanied the skeleton (Fig. 7i).

The floor was formed by a layer of cancab finished with a thin layer of stucco. After the room was completed, the cancab floor was removed almost totally, and a stucco floor was extended. The secondary floor was broken through, and Feature M1248 was formed and then sealed with a stucco patch. A third and last floor was laid at a later date and then broken through to make room for Crypt M1244 and Urn Burial M1245, both covered by stucco patches. Both the second and the last floors connected the west and south rooms by a low, stucco ramp. Feature M1248 Feature M1248 was formed by a ring of un- worked stones covered by flat slabs of limestone Fig. 7j). It contained only five pieces of char- coal. The stucco patch covering the opening made through the secondary floor raised a very noticeable hump, indicating that there was no effort to conceal the location of this feature. Crypt M1244 Crypt M1244 (Fig. 7d), the smallest uncov. ered during the excavation, was located imme- diately above Feature M1248. Its sides and top were formed by slabs of roughly worked lime- stone, and the infant burial was placed inside it in an extended position. The skull, pointed to- ward the east, was covered by an inverted tripod plate (M1244-1) from which the supports and a section of the rim had been broken (Fig. 10k). Also located in the area of the skull was a small, white bead, painted blue (M1244-2), which is reminiscent of the white beads stuck to the hair of little boys until after "baptism" in 16th-cen- tury Yucatan (Landa 1941: 102). Urn Burial M1245 An opening was made through both the last and the second-to-last floors to accom- modate burial M1245. After the infant was placed in the urn (M1245-2), which had a small hole punched in its side, an inverted, tripod plate (M1245-1) with broken supports and rim was placed over the neck of the urn (Fig. 101, m). A flat stone was then placed on top of the inverted plate, followed by three smaller stones, and the rest of the opening was sealed with a stucco patch. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not the infant within the urn represents a primary or secondary burial be- cause the skeletal remains formed an asymmet- rical pile at the bottom of the dirt-free urn. The North Room After the construction of the north room was completed, its floor and walls were stuccoed. The original floor was later removed, a new floor was laid, and the walls were restuccoed as had been done in the other rooms. The wall dividing the north room into two separate rooms and the one blocking the entrance between the north and south rooms were erected on the sec- ondary floor. After the addition of these fea- tures, the sills associated with the exterior en- tances were elevated, new floors were laid in both rooms, and the walls were stuccoed for the third time. Two fragments of a floor were located in the north room under what was thought to be the earliest floor associated with the building. The first and earliest of these floor fragments has no apparent associations, but the second and later floor fragment is the same one that is as- sociated with the east room and the eastern end of the central dividing wall. It is possible that the later floor was laid after the construction of the original platform but before the erection of Structure 385, or that both these floors repre- sent a change in construction plans. The for- mer inference is supported by Early Classic con- struction techniques at Uaxactin, and the latter by the beginning of a jamb at the eastern end of the central dividing wall. Observations Structure 385 was occupied from either late Phase I or early Phase II of the Early period until the end of the Pure Florescent, when its vaults collapsed. Although a few sherds of Black-on-cream ware were located in the area of the collapsed vault, their position suggests that they are intrusive. None of the crypts, burial urns, or cist burials from Structure 385 are associated with its earliest occupation. The earliest funerary ob- jects, such as those from Crypt M1239, corres- pond to Andrews' Copo complex (Willey, Cul- bert, and Adams 1967, Fig. 1); however, there are reasons to assume that the building dates from an earlier period. Although it has not been possible to analyze the sherds recovered from this structure, its beginning date is based both on its architectural shape, which is simi- lar to but predates the Standing Temple in Dzibilchaltuin classified by Andrews (1965a: 54) FOLAN ] 445</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY I 2 3 4M.

A polychrome vase excavated from the primary platform on which Structures 38-sub and 385 are built has been classified by Robert Smith (in Andrews 1961: 13) as a Tepeu I ware and therefore pertains to the Early facet of the Copo complex. Although the vase was not sealed beneath the earliest floor of the platform, it strongly supports the inference that the plat- form and associated buildings were built, ideally, no later than Phase II of the Early pe- riod. If the vase is intrusive, this could support a late Phase I association. Moreover, many poly. chrome sherds were recovered from beneath the earliest floors of Structure 385; although it is not known whether they are fragments of Piim or Copo complex Early facet wares, there is a strong possibility that they and the other infer- ences mentioned above indicate that this build- ing was constructed and occupied during at least Phase II of the Early period or earlier. STRUCTURE 384 Before excavation Structure 384 was a mound of collapsed masonry mixed with earth and rot- ted vegetation. Only the top of the dividing wall between its north and south walls was visible. Structure 384 is a two-room, vaulted structure constructed with block masonry joined mainly by cancab mortar and spalls (Figs. 11 and 12). Some of the base stones closely resemble the large slabs forming the platform wall basal stones. In a few instances lime mortar was used to place spalls, as in the case of Structure 385, and to bind a few of the wall stones. As in Structures 38-sub and 385, little effort was taken to face the building stones, cornices, and vault springs, although some care was taken to form the jambs and exterior corners. The vault stones were flat, unworked slabs of limestone. The lin- tels, which are assumed to have been wooden beams, were not located during excavation. Also no stucco was found on the exterior walls. Two anthropomorphic sculptures, one with a tenon (M1205-1) and one without (M1273-1), the latter probably forming part of a figure, were uncovered while the rubble was being removed from the northeast outside corner of the struc- ture (Fig. 13). Because of the proximity of these objects to both Structure 384 and the Pure Flo- rescent period Structure 386, it was not possible to determine to which building they originally pertained. Moreover, a metate (M1205-2) lo- cated in the collapsed masonry of the building could have been reused in the construction of the wall or discarded where found after the building had partially collapsed (Fig. 1). Five Florescent decorative elements were uncovered to the east of the exterior entrance to the south room. Among these stones is one identical to a decorative element recovered from the east side of the Florescent Structure 386. Because these stones were located near the stairway and ramp leading to the platform, it is inferred that while the masonry originally associated with Structure 386 was being removed, during either pre-Columbian or Colonial times, these decora- tive elements were stacked and left near the access point to and from the platform; they FIG. 12.

A small, ceramic pedestal (M1219-1, Fig. 14a) was located on top of the collapsed wall forming the west side of the south room. It could have fallen or been discarded there, or perhaps it may represent part of a cache made after the collapse of the building. The North Room After the construction of the north room, both the walls and the floor were stuccoed, but the original floor was removed later to provide space for Crypt M1263, and a wall was built blocking the interior entrance between the north and south rooms. After the crypt was occu- pied, a wall-to-wall altar or bench was built abutting the wall blocking the interior entry- way at the south end of the room, and the floor and walls were restuccoed. Later, Ur Burial M1231 was placed in an opening through the last floor in the northwest comer of the room. When the um was in place, the opening in the floor was closed with a stucco patch. A midden was located at the eastern base of the altar or bench, and the stucco forming its top showed evidence of burning, as did some of the flat stones found on top of it. Crypt M1263 The sides and top of Crypt M1263, oriented north-to-south, were formed by large, flat slabs of roughly shaped limestone (Fig. 11a). This feature and M1239, located in the west room of Structure 385, are not only the largest and ear- liest crypts uncovered during the excavation, but they also demonstrate more careful forma- tion. Three ceramic objects (M1263-1, M1263-2, and M1263-3, Fig 14d, e, f) were lo- cated at the south end, and a spindle whorl (M1263-4) was located near the center of the crypt. No skeletal material was found in the crypt, but the bottom was covered by a layer of fine ash. Although no skeletal material was located, it is assumed that if the crypt con- tained a burial, the skull would have been lo- cated at the north end and the lower phalanges at the south end, associated with the three ce- ramic objects as in the case of Crypt M1239. Urn Burial M1231 The burial um (M1231-1), located in the northwest comer of the room, was covered by an inverted tripod plate (M1231-2) in a frag- mentary condition due to the collapsed vault (Figs. llc and 14 b, c). The urn had a hole punched in its side, and a piece of rim had also been removed intentionally. The condi- tion of the infant remains inside the urn made it impossible to determine whether the burial was primary or secondary, but in the case of this a c d e h f FIG. 14.

The South Room The original stucco floor associated with the south room was not removed when a secondary floor was laid, the walls restuccoed, and the door sill of the exterior entrance raised. The last floor was broken through to form Crypt M1271, which was covered by a stucco patch. Three trough-type metates (M1220-2, M1220-3, and M1220-4) were located resting on a thin layer of dirt covering the last floor in the room (Fig. 11). Crypt M1271 Crypt M1271 was the least complex of those recorded during the 1961-62 excavations (Fig. llb). Its sides were formed by stones origi- nally used to form the base of Structure 384, and it was covered with unworked limestone slabs. Two incomplete, tripod plates (M1271-1 and M1271-2, Fig. 14g, h) were located on the stones covering the crypt, and a cut and pierced Spon- dylus shell (M1271-3) was recovered from what may be the pubic area of the two incomplete skeletons in the crypt. This shell is reminiscent of Landa's (1941:102) statement that like ob- jects hung in the pubic area of small girls be- fore "baptism." A small, triangular, stone celt (M1271-4) was located outside the crypt to the southeast. The disturbed condition of the skeletal mate- rials (which may be due to, animal action, for a large ground wasp nest was found in the crypt) made it impossible to determine with certainty the orientation of the burials or whether they were primary or secondary burials. Because, however, the greater part of the cranial mate- rial was at the eastern end of the crypt, it is assumed that the skulls were oriented toward the east. Observations The architectural development of Structure 384 closely parallels that of 385; the major ex- ceptions were fewer floor additions to the former and the choice of leaving the altar or bench in the north room of Structure 384 rather than re- moving it as was done in the west room of Struc- ture 385. The construction period of the build- ing parallels that of 38-sub and 385 for most of the same reasons stated for the latter structure. The building did not undergo structural change until the late part of Phase II of the Early pe- riod or the beginning of the Pure Florescent subperiod when Crypt M1263, the wall blocking the interior entrance between the north and south rooms, and the altar or bench abutting the secondary wall were built. Other innova- tions occurred during the late Pure Florescent subperiod when Crypt M1271 was placed under the secondary floor of the south room and Urn Burial M1231 was added to the north room. Unfortunately, it is not known when the struc- ture collapsed, but it can be assumed that it stood more or less as long as Structure 385. STRUCTURE 386 Before excavation Structure 386 resembled a low, flat platform covered with earth. Only a few remnants of fallen masonary were visible. A small section of exposed masonry at the eastern end of the building had been excavated by the Middle American Research Institute in 1960 in connection with the excavation of Structures 38 and 38-sub. This building was erected on the secondary platform addition also associated with the con- struction of Structure 38, which was classified by Andrews (1961: 13) as a Pure Florescent structure. It was a vaulted structure built of cut and faced Florescent stones joined with lime mortar on a dry wall footing (Figs. 15 and 16). Only 49 stones pertaining to the basal molding and walls of the building were found in situ. The major part of the collapsed or demolished structure had been removed - possibly for re- use in a later period structure. Decorative ele- ments originally pertaining to, the building were found scattered around the platform and at ground level on its northern side. These ele- ments are simple, fringe motifs, small column drums (Columnitas), spool elements, dentate triangles probably associated with a zig-zag motif, and conical elements with an undeco- rated surface (probably used as mask headdress fillets or eye pupils). Due to the incompleteness of the structure, it is difficult to suggest a valid reconstruction, but another Pure Florescent structure, excavated by Robert Funk under An- drews' supervision, is similar; therefore, it served as the model for the partial reconstruction of Structure 386. During excavation three crypts (M1255, M1257, and M1261), two burial urns (M1256 and M1258), and three caches (M1254, M1259, and M1260) were uncovered.

Drawing by Marino and Brathwaite. these features correspond in time to the erec- tion of the structure, or whether they post. date it. Crypt Ml 255 The sides of Crypt M1255, oriented east-to- west, were formed of roughly shaped stones topped by slabs of unworked limestone (Fig. 15c). Although no skeletal remains were found, a tripod plate (M1255-1), with its sup- ports broken off, was located in an inverted posi- tion at the eastern end of the crypt; another (M1255-2) was found immediately to the west of the former plate, and a hemispherical bowl (M1255-3) was found in an upright position in the approximate center of the crypt (Fig. 17b, c, d). A Ficus papyratia Say. shell (M1255-4) was located on the slabs covering the crypt. If it is assumed that the crypt did contain a burial which had totally disintegrated, it can be in- ferred that the skull was oriented to the east and was covered by the inverted plate (M1255-1); the other inverted plate (M1255-2) covered the chest, and the upright, hemispheri- cal bowl (M1255-3) was placed between the legs. Crypt M1257 The construction of Crypt M1257 is almost identical to the one described above (Fig. 15b). A broken tripod plate (M1257-1) and an incom- plete hemispherical bowl (M1257-2) were lo- cated at its eastern end (Fig. 17f, g). Although only a small amount of skeletal material was re- covered, it was possible to ascertain that the skull was oriented toward the east. Crypt M1261 Crypt M1261, located in the west room of the building (Fig. 15a) and made of the same type of material as the two described above, contained an inverted, broken, tripod plate (M1261-1), with its supports intact, which covered a few skull fragments oriented toward the east (Fig. 17k). Burial Urns Ml 256 and Ml 258 Burial Um M1256 (Fig. 17e) was found with- out a tripod plate cover and in a fragmentary condition among the fill stones forming the base of the structure (Fig. 15d). Although no skele- tal material was found in the urn, this may be due to the disintegration of the bones, which is assumed to be the reason for the almost complete absence of skeletal material from all of the crypts and burial urns associated with this building. Three unidentified shells were located near the um. Burial Um M1258 (not illustrated), with- out skeletal material and badly fragmented, was located near the western outside limit of Crypt M1257 (Fig. 15e). Caches M1254, M1 259 and M1260 Several caches were located among the fill stones forming the base of the building (Fig. FIG. 16. Structure 386 viewed from the southeast after consolidation and partial reconstruction. FOLAN ] 449</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 15f, g, h). Cache M1254 is an upright, hemis- pherical bowl, and Cache M1259 was a broken, tripod plate with its supports removed (M1259.1). The latter (Cache M1259) was found with a similar, although incomplete, plate (M1259-2). Also located together in another part of the fill were a broken but complete cylin- drical bowl (M1260-1) and a pierced Marginella labiata Valenciennes shell (M1260-2, Fig. 17a, h, i, j). Observations Structure 386 is a Pure Florescent building parallel in time with the construction of the sec- ondary addition to the original platform and the formation of Structure 38. This building collapsed or was demolished, or both, and most of its building stone was removed for reuse dur- ing either pre- or post-Columbian times. Wheth- er the building collapsed or fell due to being demolished may be conjectural, but the broken urns in the building indicate that the vault fell hard enough to break several of the ceramic objects located beneath the floor. The low height of the standing architecture could not be due to collapse alone, however, and it must have been the result of the planned removal of the wall stones. A decorative element, probably from Struc- ture 386, was uncovered under the fallen vault of the south room of Structure 385. This strong- ly indicates that the former structure collapsed or was demolished before the latter, which probably collapsed prior to the end of the Pure Florescent. Furthermore, there are several Flor- escent stones incorporated into the secondary masonry wall dividing the north room of Struc- ture 385. It cannot be determined with total certainty, however, whether or not these stones originally formed part of Structure 386. Although none of the base stones of the north or west walls of the structure were found in situ, it was possible to determine the outline of the building by the dry stone footing located be- neath it. Although no empirical evidence was found to determine the location of more than one exterior entrance (the easternmost) and nothing pertaining to interior entrances or di- viding walls was found, a monolithic stone which may represent a jamb or lintel was un- covered on the south side of the west room of the structure. THE LAST PLATFORM ADDITION AND STRUCTURE 37 The last addition to the platform postdates the construction of Structure 38, 38-sub, 384, and 386 (Fig. 1). The masonry of the last plat- form addition closely resembles that of both the primary and secondary platforms, with the exception of the monolithic blocks forming part of the base and the northwest corner. The asymmetric orientation of the west wall of the platform is due to the proximity of sacbe #8 which is assumed to predate it. At the south- west corner of the platform, an earthen ramp and steps provided access to the group. This addition was necessary, it is assumed, because the construction of Structure 37, a stepped, tem- ple mound facing the central plaza, prompted the removal of the original stairway which faced the central plaza and led from ground level to the south facade of Structure 385. After the re- moval of the original stairway and the construc- tion of Structure 37, the area between the south face of the primary platform and the north side of Structure 37 was filled to approximate the last level of the platform. The stairs, ramp, and a stone walkway parallel to the south fagade of Structure 385 provided access to Structures 384 and 385 in particular and the platform in gen- eral. Although it cannot be proven categorically (with the data at hand), it is inferred that the following are all parallel in time: the construc- tion of the platform extension with its mono- lithic base stones; Structure 37, built with similar stones; the removal of the primary stair- case; the construction of the stone walkway in front of Structure 385; and the addition of the ramp and stairs leading to the platform. Al- though the removal of the original staircase might appear unnecessary or illogical, this fea- ture is not unique to this building, as the pri- mary staircase was removed from the base supporting Structure 38-sub before the erection of the monolithic stone Structure 38. If the above inference is not valid, another alternative is that Structures 38, 386, and 37 are parallel in time, and the last addition to the platform postdates their construction. This would have necessitated the addition of another stairway leading to the platform, if the primary staircase had been removed prior to the construction of Structure 37. Although no stairway other than the one on the southwest side of the last addi- tion to the platform was uncovered during the excavation, the Maya could have built another 450 [ VOL. 34, No. 4, 1969</page><page sequence="18">DZIBILCHALTON b '??`' ui`i:W .Ilr ?.??1.:?-?: -t?::: ?

CHRONOLOGICAL AND CERAMIC OBSERVATIONS For reasons stated above, Structures 38-sub, 384, 385, and their associated platform were constructed and occupied during late Phase I or early Phase II of the Early period, or they rep. resent a transition between the two subperiods. The construction of Structures 38, 386, and their associated platform, and of Structure 37 cor- responds to the Pure Florescent. While the construction of Structure 37 may not be exactly coeval with Structure 38 and 386, it is inferred here that it corresponds to the same building period as the last addition to the platform. In the following analysis, Willey, Culbert, and Adams' (1967), Smith and Gifford's (1965), or Brainerd's (1958) designations are used var- iously. All data strongly indicate that Structure 385 was not modified until the end of Phase II of the Early period or the beginning of the Pure Florescent subperiod. At that time, Crypt M1239 and an altar or bench were added to the west room of Structure 385, Feature M1248 was added to its east room, and the building was refloored and the interior walls restuccoed. The wares from Crypt M1239, associated with the west room of Structure 385, pertain to the Copo complex (Fig. 9) and include the following: a slab-footed, tripod plate (M1239-1) with a mot- tled black surface; a hemispherical, Slateware bowl (M1239-2); a Fine Grey ware vessel with a glossy finish (M1239-3); a Fine Grey ware with a monkey motif, also with a glossy finish (M1239-4); a Fine Grey ware or Thin Slateware cylindrical vase (M1239-5); and a Fine Grey ware vessel with a hollow, rattle base (M1239- 6). Although M1239-7 has the shape of a Fine Grey ware vase (Smith and Gifford 1965, Fig. lOb), the paste is coarser than most wares of this type. The anthropomorphic warrior whistle (M1239-8) belongs to the Copo complex, as does the small head of a mammal (M1239-9, Brainerd 1958, Figs. 54-56). A Copo tripod plate (M1239-10) is an almost exact duplicate of the Tepeu III Black Achote ware from Uax- actuin illustrated by Smith and Gifford (1965, Fig. 9j), and M1239-11 is a Copo complex Slate- ware tripod plate. Crypt M1263, associated with the altar or bench in the north room of Structure 384 (Fig. 14), is stratigraphically related to Crypt M1239. Two of the Copo complex wares (M1263-1 and -2) in the crypt closely match Brainerd's (1958: 50-1, Fig. 12, Chart 22) description of his Ox- kintok Regional Blackware and Coarse Black- ware respectively, with the exception of the flaky surface of M1263-2, which he places in his Mid- dle Regional stage; the other (M1263-4) is a good example of his Regional-Florescent, Early Flore- scent Carved wares (Brainerd 1958, Fig. 12e). After the above crypts were sealed by sec- ondary floors, Structures 38, 386, and possibly 37 were added to the group, the primary plat- form was restuccoed, and the secondary plat- form was stuccoed. Several crypts, ums, and, in Structure 386, several c a c h e s were formed coeval with or shortly after the construction of Structures 386 and 37, and the stuccoing of the secondary platform and the restuccoing of the primary platform. These will be discussed sepa- rately. A Copo Fine Grey ware bowl (M1260-1) with a matte surface, a hollow, rattle base, and an incised monkey motif may be the earliest cache associated with the Pure Florescent Struc- ture 386, because it is similar to the Fine Grey wares from Crypt M1239 in the west room of Structure 385. Moreover, Crypt M1255 in the Florescent Structure 386 contains what is con- sidered to be a Copo complex Oxkintok Re- gional Coarse Blackware plate (M1255-1) with a surface identical to the Coarse Blackware bowl (M1263-2) from Crypt M1263 in the north room of Structure 384, a Slateware tripod plate (M1255-2), and a Slateware bowl (M1255-3, Fig. 17). Most of the other wares (Fig. 17) associated with Structure 386 are Copo Slateware tripod plates (M1259-1 and 2, M1257-1, and M1261-1) and hemispherical bowls (M1254-1 and M1257-2) which are virtually identical to the hemispherical bowl (M1239-2) from Crypt M1239 in the west room of Structure 385. The only exception to this is two Copo complex Lus- trous Streaky Brown narrow-necked jars (M1256-1 and M1258-1) commonly used as bur- ial urns. These urns were often associated with Pure Florescent structures excavated in Dzibil- chaltun (Andrews 1965a: 313). Furthermore, as will be noted below, when the urns from Structures 384 and 385 were sealed, they were covered exclusively with inverted Copo Slate- ware tripod plates with slab supports. 452 [ VOL. 34, No. 4,1969</page><page sequence="20">DZIBILCHALTON After the addition of the last floor to the pri- mary platform, Crypt M1264 was formed and two Copo Slateware tripod plates (M1264-1 and -3) and a Z-type Fine Orange ware bowl (M1264-2) were enclosed as funerary objects (Fig. 5). After the formation of Crypt M1263 in the north room of Structure 384, Crypt M1271, which contained two fragmented, Copo Slate- ware slab-footed plates (M1271-1 and -2), was formed in the south room of the same struc- ture. Burial urn M1231-1, a Lustrous Streaky Brown ware covered by a slab-footed, Slateware plate (M1231-2), was added to the north room (Fig. 14). After the formation of Crypt M1239 in the west room of Structure 385, Crypts M1237, M1243, and M1244 were added to the south and east rooms of the same structure. In the south room Crypt M1237 contained a Copo Slateware hemispherical bowl (M1237-1) and a slab-footed Slateware plate (M1237-2). Crypt M1243 con- tained a Copo Thin Slateware cylindrical vase (M1243-1) and a slab-footed, Slateware tripod plate (M1243-2), and in the east room of the structure Crypt M1244 contained a Slateware tripod plate (M1244-1, Fig. 10). Urn Burial M1242, associated with the south room of Structure 385, is a Copo Lustrous Streaky Brown ware (M1242-1) accompanied by a fragmented urn (M1242-4) of the same ware. Burial urn M1232-1 is a Striated Copo Unslipped ware, resembling a similar jar from the Puuc area (Brainerd 1958, Fig. 68d), and was capped by an upright, Slateware tripod plate (M1232-2) with teat-shaped legs. This is not only the only striated burial urn recov- ered during the excavation, but also it is the only one capped by a plate with teat-shaped supports in an upright position. Burial urn M1245-2 is associated with the east room and is another example of Lustrous Streaky Brown ware covered by a slab-footed, Slateware tri- pod plate (M1245-1, Fig. 10). Also in the south room of Structure 385, Cist Burial M1240 was accompanied by a Slateware hemispherical bowl (M1240-1, virtually identi- cal to the hemispherical bowl from the earlier Crypt M1239) and probably the Lustrous Streaky Brown urn (M1240-3, Fig. 10). Cist Burial M1241 was accompanied by a few frag- ments of Slateware. After the collapse of Structure 384, a small, Zipche complex pedestal was placed on top of the collapsed wall forming the west side of the south room of the structure (Fig. 14a). Until Andrews publishes his analysis of the mountain of ceramic material recovered during his many years of excavation in Dzibilchaltuin, the chronological placement of wares from at least the two earliest crypts (M1239 and M1263) and other like wares is somewhat tentative as to whether they pertain to the Early or Late facets of the Copo complex. If Smith and Gifford's and Brainerd's analyses are accepted, however, and if my interpretation of their analyses is cor- rect, the wares from these two crypts and the urn burials and caches recovered from Struc- tures 384, 385, and 386 represent a chronologi- cal overlap of Smith and Gifford's Motul and Cehpech phases. Andrews (1965b: 313) explains the presence of Fine Grey ware, "so distinctive of pre-Flores- cent ceramics" but unquestionably associated with the evolved Florescent at Dzibilchaltuin, by stating that Florescent forms are earlier in Dzibilchaltun than the Puuc area. According to Brainerd (1958) and Ruz, however, Fine Grey wares are absent in this latter area, though Brainerd (1958, Figs. 28, 53) does note the oc- currence of Fine Grey wares (admittedly in small quantities) from Uxmal, Kabah, and Sayil. Andrews also states (1965: 313) that Fine Grey wares were traded from the south- ern mainland directly through the Puuc area. Although this may be the case, the wares could also have been transported by water to the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula, mak- ing Dzibilchaltfin their earliest recipient due to its geographical location. Also to be remem- bered is that almost all of the excavation in the Puuc area has been done to consolidate and reconstruct standing architecture; therefore, lit- tle effort has been made to locate the crypts or caches that may well contain as much Fine Grey ware as those from Dzibilchalt6n. In fact, the Puuc is one of the most archaeologically neglected geographical and cultural areas in- habited by the Maya. When the Lustrous Streaky Brown burial urns from Structures 384 and 385 were covered, they were sealed exclusively with Copo Slate- ware, slab-footed, tripod plates. If Smith and Gifford's placement of this variety which they label Dzibilchaltfin ware and which they place in the Motul phase is correct, this would also indicate very strongly that their Motul and Cehpech phases overlap as suggested above. FOLAN ] 453</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY THE FUNCTIONS OF STRUCTURES 38-SUB, 38, 384, AND 385 This section, based in part on Taylor's (1948) formula, is an attempt to define the use and function of each room in each building form- ing the group and, thus, of the group as a whole, from its inception to the present. Both the prehistoric and historic occupation and/or utilization of the group are divided into mini- phases that apply to this group of structures only. They are not intended to refer to either Dzibilchaltuin as a cultural unit or to the north- ern section of Yucatafn. It should be noted that some of the statements contained in this analy- sis are the product of conjecture, and to quote Andrews (personal communication, 1968), who read the manuscript, the evidence for the fol- lowing "room-by-room analysis is often skating on very thin ice." The first division is labeled the Primary phase. It extends from the inception of the group dur- ing the later part of Andrews' Early period, First phase, or the beginning of his Early period, Second phase, and ends toward the termination of the Early period, Second phase. This and the following correlations refer to Andrews' cul- tural periods only and not to his dates for these periods. The second division is divided into two parts. The first is termed the Early Expansion phase, which matches the later part of Andrews' Early period, Second phase, and the early part of his Pure Florescent; it is marked by the formation of Crypts M1239, M1263, and the subsequent erec- tion of Structures 38 and 386. The second di- vision of my Expansion phase is termed Late. It is marked by the building of the following: Structure 37 and the last addition to the plat- form; all of the crypts and the urn and cist burials (with the exception of Crypt M1239) from Structure 385; Crypt M1271 and Urn Bur- ial M1231 from Structure 384; Crypt M1264 associated with the platform; and most of the crypts, urns, and caches from Structure 386. This division matches the last three-quarters of Andrews' Pure Florescent subperiod. The last division is the Terminal phase, which includes everything from Andrew's Mod- ified Florescent subperiod up to and including his Colonial period. THE PRIMARY PHASE Structure 38-sub Several features of Structure 38-sub strong- ly indicate that it was constructed as either a temple or oratory and, therefore, was dedicated to ceremonial functions during the Primary phase. Such indications include the architec- tural shape of Structure 38-sub, its position in relation to the other buildings sharing the same platform, its greater height due to being built on a raised platform, and its orientation toward the west as were temples or oratories (Landa 1941: 25). Structure 385 Structure 385 was located in a key position during the Primary phase because, it is inferred, the stairway leading to the earliest platform and its associated Structures 38-sub and 384 was lo- cated immediately in front of its south side. Therefore, all movement of people to or from the platform or any of its buildings would ideally have to pass through the exterior en- trances associated with the south facade of Structure 385 and would have to exit through its north or west doorways to visit other people or buildings on the platform. It may be inferred that the south room of Structure 385 was a re- ception chamber. This is supported by Landa's statement (1941: 86) that the nobles' residences in 16th-century Yucatfan were divided by longi- tudinal walls, as is Structure 385, forming a front section which was used for the reception and lodging of guests. Although Landa stated that this room had no doors, it seems reasonable to assume from his description and from De- cadent period structures excavated in Mayapan (Smith 1962) that he meant that the interior of the room was not divided "but is open the whole length of the house" (Landa 1941: 86). The function of the north room during the Primary phase was probably the same as that of the back room of the 16th-century nobles' dwell- ings described by Landa (1941: 86) as their sleeping quarters. Two cord-holders (one be- low the other) located on the west side, and a single cord-holder on the upper east side of the entrance from the south room into the north room were situated below the level of the lin- tel; they seem to have been designed to fa- cilitate entry from the sleeping quarters in the north room into the reception area in the south room by enabling an occupant to push the mat aside. Although a mat may have been hung from the upper cord-holders (if it was not hung from the wooden lintel), the lower cord-holder may have only been used to tie down one corner of the mat on windy days, or it may possibly 454 [ VOL. 34, No. 4,1969</page><page sequence="22">DZIBILCHALTJON have been used by guests to separate their quar- ters more completely from those of their hosts in the north room. Instead of a lower cord- holder on the east side of the doorway, an ob- long, smoothed, and horizontally grooved object of volcanic stone was embedded in the wall. A single cord-holder located outside the building in the north wall of the north room, to the west of the western entrance, would fa- cilitate passage from the north room to the plaza then formed by Structures 38-sub and 384. A cord-holder located on the west side of the western entrance inside the room presents a problem, but this feature could have been used to hang a mat inside the room on windy days and thus to prevent it from being blown about. The general inference is that cord-holders locat- ed on one side of an entrance are so situated to facilitate entry from the other side, by enabling the occupants to enter by merely pushing aside the mat that the cord-holders are assumed to have supported. The east room was probably one of the shrines located inside the houses of the lords, priests, and leading men in 16th-century Yucatan (Lan- da 1941: 171). This room has two cord-holders (one below the other) located on the north side of the doorway leading into the room; this would have facilitated entry into it as inferred above. No cord-holders were located on the south side of the doorway, but this is probably due to the more complete collapse of this side of the entrance. The west room has two entrances and no cord-holders to hang mats to close off either en- trance. This may indicate that it served a do- mestic function and that it was unnecessary or even inadvisable to close it, due to smoke from cooking fires. If the above inferences are valid, it may be stated that Structure 385 was originally planned to be used as a dwelling and meeting place for lords, priests, and other nobility. It also con- tained a personal shrine and possibly a domestic area in its west room. Structure 384 The function of Structure 384 during the Primary phase is difficult to establish without analyzing the ceramics associated with its ear- liest levels. It may be inferred, however, that this two-room structure could have been used for both domestic and ceremonial functions, as it was at a later date. If these functions are assumed, the south room may have served a do- mestic function, and the north room, the en- trance to which is in line with the entrance to Structure 38-sub, a ceremonial one. Observations During the Primary phase, Structures 38-sub, 384, and 385 as a group served a basically cere- monial function, but they were also used by theocrats who lived in the north room of Struc- ture 384 and, possibly, received some of their domestic necessities from the west room of the same structure. Whether the function of Struc- ture 384 was either ceremonial or domestic is conjectural, but it may have been used for both as it was during a later phase (see below). EXPANSION PHASE: EARLY The early part of the Expansion phase is rep- resented by the formation of Crypts M1239 and M1263 and by the subsequent construction of Structures 38 and 386. Structures 38,sub and 38 After the beginning of this phase, several bur- ials were made in Structure 38-sub (Andrews 1961: 13); it was later filled with stones, its staircase was removed, a complex system of retaining walls was added to its sides, and Struc- ture 38 was built over it. Unfortunately, insuf- ficient data were recovered to determine the shape of the superstructure crowning the sec- ondary, monolithic masonry platform (Andrews 1962, Fig. 3). It may be inferred, however, that this structure served a ceremonial function, as did its predecessor. Structure 385 The function of the south room of Structure 385 remained unchanged during the Early Ex- pansion phase, as did that of the north room, although both were restuccoed. Feature M1248, located in the east room, was formed during this phase. Although this feature has all the ap- pearances of a cache, nothing was recovered from it except a few pieces of charcoal, which may indicate that it contained a cremated offer- ing. The main function of the room remained ceremonial. The function of the west room is clearer dur- ing this phase. Its original floor was removed to form Crypt M1239, which contained a pri- mary adult and a child burial. If it is inferred that the principal skeleton in the crypt is a male and that the warrior whistle accompanying it 455 FOLAN ]</page><page sequence="23">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY indicates that he belonged to a military order, it may also be inferred that the broken condi- tion of the whistle (shield, sandal element, and part of the neck element removed) signifies that the warrior (its assumed owner who may have been a Ceh) was either mortally wounded or killed in battle. After the crypt was covered, a new floor and a wall-to-wall altar or bench were added to the room. Because the formation of this feature is coeval with the crypt, it may be inferred that it was used as an altar and that the room was then used for ceremonial functions only and may now be described as a shrine like the east room. This practice is reminiscent of the mason- ry altars erected over burials located outside structures in the Alta Verapaz area on which, according to Roman y Zamora (in Thompson 1939: 284), local people burned incense and offered sacrifices. This inference is further sup- ported by the small amount of ceramics recov- ered from the floor and a lack of ash, which may indicate that it was not used as a domestic area. Moreover, the burned area in the center of the floor seems to be due to ceremonial rath- er than domestic fires when the above factors are considered. During this phase the basic function of Struc- ture 385 did not change. It provided housing for theocrats and their shrines, a reception room for guests, and a burial area for the remains of a soldier-theocrat who may have belonged to the Ceh lineage and who probably resided in the structure. Structure 384 The north room of Structure 384 underwent basically the same changes as did the west room in Structure 385. The original floor was re- moved, Crypt M1263 was formed, the floor was restuccoed, the wall dividing the north and south rooms was erected, and the wall-to-wall altar or bench was built abutting it. During this phase the function of the north room was ceremonial, if it is assumed that the latter fea- ture was used as an altar and that it was not used as a bench for domestic purposes. Because the formation of similar featurez in this room and in the west room of Structi.re 3S5 are associated with crypts, it may be stated that both were dedicated to the occupants of the crypts who may have resided in or been in some way associated with the building. This inference is further supported by Lopez (Tozzer 1941: 227) who states that magistrates in Guatemala were honored by burying them at the "very spot where they were accustomed to sit and adminis- ter justice and to vote and execute those notable works which they did in the republic." The function of the south room of this struc- ture is still conjectural if the metates located within the room or others uncovered outside it were not used for domestic purposes during this phase. It seems reasonable to infer, how- ever, that the entrance between the north and south rooms may have been sealed not only to build an altar in the north room, but also to form a separate, domestic area in the south room. Structure 386 During the Early Expansion phase the Flores- cent Structure 386 was built on an addition to the north side of the primary platform coeval with the filling of Structure 38-sub and the erec- tion of Structure 38 over it. Although little is known about the overall function of the struc- ture during the Early Expansion phase, it was used for burial purposes and as a depository for a dedicatory cache, attested to by at least Crypt M1255 and Cache M1260, respectively. Be- cause of the complete absence of a floor in the structure, it was impossible to determine which (if any) crypts, urns, or caches were formed when the building was constructed and which are intrusive. Nevertheless, because the above crypt and cache are accompanied by what seems to be the earliest ceramic types associated with the structure, it is assumed that they are closely connected to the construction of the building and, therefore, that the remaining features post- date its formation. An attempt is made to more fully define the use and function of the building during the Late Expansion phase. Observations The primary function of the group during the Early Expansion phase remained unchanged from its function in the Primary phase. The several additions-Structures 38 and 386, at least two crypts, a cache, two altars and a blocked interior doorway between the north and south rooms of Structure 384 - only slightly altered the use of the associated structures; they did not, however, alter the overall function, which was ceremonial. EXPANSION PHASE: LATE During the Late Expansion phase, Structure 37 was erected, and the addition was built on 456 [ VOL. 34, No. 4, 1969</page><page sequence="24">DZIBILCHALTON the west end of the platform. Structure 385 was altered architecturally, the altar was re- moved from its west room, and several burial crypts, urn and cist burials, and caches were in- corporated into the group. Structure 38 This building served the same function as its predecessor, Structure 38-sub, which formed part of its fill. Like the earlier 38-sub, the cere- monial function of the building may have been to provide the inhabitants of the group with an oratory in contrast to the more individual shrines used by the residents of the group in the east and west rooms of Structure 385 and pos, sibly the north room of Structure 384. Structure 385 Structure 385 underwent several changes dur- ing the Late Expansion phase. The staircase leading from the central plaza to the south room was removed coeval with the construction of Structure 37; the area between Structure 385 and 37 was filled, and the walkway was built paralleling the faqade of the south room. Inside the south room, which now assumed a domestic function, a metate was in use, and a midden was forming on the west side of the room. Crypts M1237 and M1243 and Um Burial M1242 were added to the south room; Cist Burials M1240 and M1241 were made through the midden, and Um Burial M1232, located in the northwest cor- ner of the room, was buried in the midden. Also during this phase the doorway connecting the south and north rooms was: blocked at least par- tially, and the easternmost exterior entrance to the room was sealed. Although there was a gradual change in the use of the south room, it is inferred that its function changed completely when the stairway was removed and Structure 37 was built, con- siderably diminishing the importance of the room which had originally faced the central plaza. The doorway between the south and north rooms was sealed when it was no longer necessary as a passageway between the sleeping area in the north room and what was once a reception area in the south room. This latter was now used for domestic and burial purposes, as demonstrated by the metate, midden, and burials made through and in the midden. The blocked exterior entrance at the east end of the room may indicate the necessity of supporting a weakened lintel or of providing shelter for women performing domestic tasks. The wall dividing the north room was prob. ably constructed at the same time that the in- terior entrance between the north and south rooms was either partially or completely closed. If the few Florescent veneer stones forming part of the dividing wall were originally associated with Structure 386, the erection of the dividing wall in the north room postdated the collapse or demolition of Structure 386. Another floor was laid in the north room after the formation of the above feature. The relatively debris-free floors in both the east and west section of the divided north room, before and after the addi- tion of the last floor, strongly suggest that it was still used as a sleeping area. The east room changed little from the time of its construction until its vault collapsed. A small crypt (M1244) was incorporated into the room through the last floor, and Urn Burial M1245 was definitely intrusive. The almost debris-free floor of this room could indicate that it was used as a sleeping area; however, since Smith (1962: 251) suggests that the Mayapfan Maya did not bury their dead under the rooms in which they slept, because they did not wish to sleep over them or it was tabu to do so, it can be assumed that the east room retained its origi- nal use as a private shrine. The function of the west room changed dur- ing this phase when the altar was removed from the north end of the room, and a new floor was laid after the midden had partially formed on the west end of the south room. The orientation of the exterior entrance to the west room (now facing the secondary ramp and steps leading to the platform) and its virtually debris-free floor suggest that this room replaced the south room as a reception area and sleeping quarters for guests. Although the dead may not have been placed below the sleeping quarters of the resi- dents of particular structures in Mayapan, they were buried in the front room (Smith 1962: 251) where guests slept regularly. Therefore, the burial vault in the west room would not, in this case, eliminate the room as a reception and sleeping area. During the Late Expansion phase, Structure 385 underwent many changes. Not only was its architectural form altered and the function of at least two of its rooms changed, but the build- ing was also cut off from direct access to and from the central plaza by the removal of its staircase and the construction of Structure 37. The appearance of the metate and midden in its FOLAN ] 457</page><page sequence="25">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY south room strongly suggests the presence of women in the building, as may the occupants of the two burial vaults in the south room if or when their sex is determined. Although fire- blackened stones were recovered from the mid- den area, a hearth was not recorded; this may be due to the hearth stones having been scat- tered when the vault collapsed or to excavation error. Furthermore, the six infant burials asso- ciated with the structure suggest that women performed domestic tasks in the building and formed part of one or more families with chil- dren, who may have used the miniature metates located in the south room as toys. On the other hand, the infant burials might represent sacri- ficial victims, and the miniature metates might have been used to grind small quantities of chile or other spices. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to infer that the south room was a kitchen, the two north rooms were a divided sleeping area housing two nuclear families, the east room was a private shrine, and the west room was a reception area for guests, who also slept there. Structure 384 The use of this building is somewhat clearer during this phase. The function of the debris, littered north room still seems to be ceremonial, but until the ceramics from the midden located near the altar are analyzed, the use or function of the room is, at best, a guess. Also, the burned area on the altar could be from either cere- monial or domestic fires. During this phase, Ur Burial M1231 was placed in an opening broken through the latest floor, but no other additions were made to this room. Although Crypt M1271 was incorporated into the south room during this phase, the three metates located beneath the collapsed vault of the room clearly define its primary function as domestic. The meaning of these metates will be further discussed in the section concerning Structure 386. Structure 386 This building, erected on the secondary plat- form addition during the Early Expansion phase, either collapsed or was demolished be- fore the Late part of the phase ended - almost certainly before the collapse of Structure 385 lo- cated across the patio from it. Following this, the rest of the building was demolished to reuse the stone in a later construction and, possibly, to use a few of them in the dividing wall in the north room of Structure 385. Little is known about the function of this structure other than that it was used for burials and contained caches. Its virtually debris-free floor level (not represented by an intact floor) may be the product of erosion, or it may denote that the interior of the building was kept free of debris during its occupation. If it can be as- sumed that the occupants of the building during its later use were not aware of the burials be- neath its floors; that they were not related to the occupants of the crypts and would, therefore, sleep over them; that the debris-free floors do indicate sleeping areas; and that the structure was divided into four rooms, then it may be inferred that it was used as a residence by three or four families whose domestic tasks were per- formed in the south room of Structure 384 where the three metates were located. The fourth room, located at the west end of the structure, could have been a private shrine; but if the north room of Structure 384 filled this need, it may be further inferred that a metate located at ground level to the north of Struc- ture 384 (Fig. 1) represents a fourth family liv- ing in the west room of the same building. The metate found above floor level among the fal- len masonry of Structure 384 could have been reused in the walls of Structure 386 or discarded there after the building had partially collapsed. If the latter inference is valid, this metate could have been used in conjunction with the metate located in the south room of Structure 385, the two metates thus matching the two sleeping quarters in the north room of the same struc- ture. If a single metate is accepted as represent- ing a nuclear family, this suggests that Struc- tures 384, 385, and 386 served to house an ex- tended, possibly patrilocal household formed by at least six nuclear families. If two metates located on the south side of Structure 38 during the 1960 excavation were also used in conjunction with Structures 384, 385, and 386, and if a single metate is accepted as representing one family, these two metates may indicate that both the east and west rooms of Structure 385 also housed a nuclear family. This probably occurred at some time postdat- ing the use of these rooms as a shrine and a reception area, respectively. The Platform and Structure 37 During the Late Expansion phase the south- east corner of the primary platform was re- 458 [ VOL. 3 4, No. 4, 1969</page><page sequence="26">DZIBILCHALTON moved, as was its staircase, and a crypt (M1264) was introduced through the latest floor. Why this individual should be buried in the center of the platform in a crypt almost identical to some located within the buildings is a moot point. Possibly the residents of the group felt that there was no more room for burial crypts in the build- ings, which may not be empirically true but may have been sufficiently valid for those liv- ing there; or possibly this was a person ranked highly by his or her contemporaries - this is the only crypt containing a Fine Orange ware bowl; or, more likely, the crypt contained an individual sacrificed to commemorate a par- ticular event such as those mentioned by Landa (1941: 120). The last platform addition was probably add- ed during the Late Expansion phase, after the construction of Structures 38 and 384 and either coeval with or immediately following the con- struction of Structure 37. There are several pos- sible reasons for the formation of the last plat- form addition. It could have been built to sup- port future structures that did not materialize either because the period of intensive building activity had terminated in Dzibilchaltun or be- cause the importance of the group was deterior- ating; or it could have been built to stage the plays described by Landa (1941: 179) in Chi- chen Itza during a later period. Structure 37 was not built to replace Struc- ture 385. It was built to, provide a temple facing the central plaza of Dzibilchaltun, which must have been, with the many features forming it and the Cenote Xlacah, a major center for both the sacred and secular functions of Dzibil- chaltirn. Observations During the Late Expansion phase the use and function of the group changed considerably. The Early Expansion phase had been marked by the addition of two structures signifying not only the need for more space but also an in- crease in importance and, possibly, a change of tenure. During the Late Expansion phase, how- ever, this trend was reversed. The ceremonial prestige of the group diminished with the in- creased use for domestic purposes indicated by metates, a midden, and the almost certain pres- ence of women and children. The end of this phase was probably due to the collapse of the structures, first Structure 386 and then the others in an undetermined order. The dyna- mism that guided the Florescent people had begun to wane, making them more receptive to the new cutural vitality provided by people coming from the Mexican highlands whose cul- ture, when combined with local traits, produced the Maya-Toltec phase of Chichen Itza. TERMINAL PHASE Prior to the Terminal phase, Structures 384, 386, and most probably 385 and 38 had col- lapsed, leaving the group much as it was de- scribed before the excavations began. Toward the end of the phase a trench was dug through the staircase of Structure 38 to the entrance of 38-sub. The stone fill was removed from the in- terior of the building and it was used once again for ceremonial purposes possibly extending into the Colonial period, when a 16th-century open chapel was constructed in the central plaza (Folan 1966). At about the same time or later, the oval ring of stones was formed on the patio to the west of Structure 38, probably as a base for an enclosure built of upright poles or some other perishable material. Following this addition, the group was not disturbed until Brainerd excavated a strati- graphic pit near the area once occupied by the southeast corner of the primary platform and drew an incomplete sketch of the group. After the Middle American Research Institute and the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e His- toria excavated, consolidated, and partially re- constructed the group, it is now an attraction serving to educate and instill a sense of tradition and nationalistic pride in Mexican visitors and to attract and educate non-Mexican tourists whose expenditures somewhat boost the lagging economy of present-day Yucatafn. The excava- tion of the group has also served to further our understanding of the pre-Columbian people who resided in it and those who worshipped at it. CONCLUDING REMARKS If Vogt's (1964: 390) statement that various pyramid structures may have been erected as ancestral lineage shrines is accepted, it may be inferred that this premise applies to Structures 38 and 38-sub. Structures 38-sub may have been built by the Ceh group to commemorate a lin- eage head revered by the general population of Dzibilchaltun, and a smaller shrine may have been located in the east room of Structure 385, dedicated either to lower ranking members within the same lineage or to general deities worshipped privately. During the Early Expan, 459 FOLAN ]</page><page sequence="27">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY sion phase, however, both the crypt and altar in the west room of Structure 385, which may have been dedicated to a member of the Ceh lineage, and the other crypt and altar in the north room of Structure 384 may indicate that two lineages were associated with the group. Furthermore, the removal of the altar from the west room of Structure 385 during the Late Ex- pansion phase may signify that the Ceh lineage was no longer associated with the group, pos- sibly due to an increase in the prestige of the lineage commensurate with the decrease of the importance of the group after the erection of Structure 37. Therefore, the unidentified lineage now inhabiting the group had the altar removed, either because it was no longer considered neces- sary or desirable since it was dedicated to an individual belonging to another lineage or be- cause more space was required. It may be fur- ther inferred that, because the altar in the north room of Structure 384 was not removed, it may have been dedicated to a member of the lineage which took over the group after it was relin- quished by the Cehes. The lineage now asso- ciated with the group probably used Structure 38 as their principal lineage oratory and may have occupied the group up to the time it was abandoned - probably due to the collapse of the buildings. The later reuse of Structure 38-sub during the Terminal phase may indicate either the re- turn of the Cehes to their ancestral oratory, the return of the members of the unidentified lin- eage, or a search for an oratory by another lineage not previously associated with the group. I prefer the two former premises because the existence of the earlier 38-sub was probably not obvious; thus it is indicated that the people who trenched into it knew that it was there, be- cause it had been their lineage oratory during the Primary phase and the beginning of the Early Expansion phase, or because they had in- habited the group when 38-sub was filled and Structure 38 was built over it. In summation, Structures 38-sub, 38, 384, 385, and 386, and the associated features housed the theocratic representatives of one or more lin- eages and their families from inception to aban- donment. There are some indications that one of these lineages (probably the Cehes) with- drew from the group sometime during the Expansion phase and possibly returned during the Terminal phase when an opening was trenched into Structure 38-sub, the ancestral ora- tory, where ceremonial activities were practiced up to and including the early part of the Colon- ial period. An alternate interpretation is that the group was first inhabited by the Cehes, represented by the burial crypt and altar in both the west room of Structure 385 and the north room of Structure 384 with their burials oriented to- ward the north. Later, the group, was aban- doned by the Cehes and inhabited by an unidentified lineage that may have built both Structures 38 and 386 and oriented most of its burials toward the east. This interpretation would also suggest that either the Cehes or the unidentified lineage tunneled into Structure 38-sub during the Terminal phase, because members of both groups could have been fa- miliar with its existence. Admittedly, both the room-by-room analysis and the concluding comments are based on scanty evidence, but they are presented here solely as an attempt to expand the archaeologi- cal understanding of Dzibilchaltfin. Acknowledgments. I would like to express my thanks to Professor Roman Pifia Chan who, as past Director of the Departmento de Monumentos Prehispanicos del Insti- tuto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, authorized the $1,760.00 to finance the project; to Juan Chable Dzib, master mason; Catalino Cohou, field foreman; and the laborers from the nearby village of Chablekal whose efforts should not go unmentioned. Also, I thank Mrs. Jean Brathwaite, who read and improved the manuscript; E. W. Andrews, who made suggestions regarding termi- nology; and A. E. Wilson, who completed the plan draw- ing of the group. Any errors or omissions, however, are my responsibility. ANDREWS, E. WYLLYS 1961 Preliminary Report on the 1959-60 Field Season, National Geographic Society-Tulane University, Dzibilchaltuin Program.
