<plain_text><page sequence="1">Soundl Designl a Scxience Fictionl by William Whittington. University of Texas Press 2007. $55.00 hardcover; $22.95 paper. 280 pages Reviewed by Jay Beck In Sound Design &amp; Science Fiction, William Whittington provides a fresh perspec tive on one of the most underdeveloped areas of sound studies: the intersection between film sound and genre. The book offers a persuasive argument regarding the interplay between the rise in popularity and status of the science fiction film in American cinema and concurrent changes of sound practices in relation to cin ematic construction. In the balance between genre and sound, the book is less a genre study and more an exploration of the function of science fiction in the de velopment of cinematic sound techniques since the 1960s. By simultaneously ex amining the rise of multiple notions of sound design in narrative cinema and the growth of science fiction's popularity, Whittington reveals the interdependence between genre codes and film sound while analyzing the constructed nature of both. His central argument hinges on the way that the development of new sound practices allowed for an emphasis on spectatorial engagement in the science fiction genre, while the genre served as a platform for both the conceptualization of sound design and the launch of new sound technologies. 1 50 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="2">The book chronologically charts seven major science fiction film projects while tying each to a specific theme associated with sound design. Whittington acknowledges that the concept of sound design is a loaded term with multiple diachronic meanings. Specifically, he defines sound design in four major ways: as the construction of new sounds, as the conceptual design of the overall sound track, as hardwired multichannel theatrical sound formats, and as a model for criti cal analysis. It is this last definition that functions as the book's prime operative. The book succeeds by placing canonical critical writings on science fiction studies into dialogue with film sound theory and history. For example, Whittington anchors the first part of his book-"The Dawn of Sound Design"-in the late 1960s and uses Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) as his first case study. There's no argument that Kubrick's film was pivotal in redefining the sci ence fiction genre, and Whittington connects contemporaneous changes in Ameri can cinema and audio culture with the exploration of the soundtrack as a new means of engaging spectators. By contextualizing his analysis of American film sound prac tices in relation to case studies, he develops a structural framework that introduces key pragmatic concepts regarding the evolution of sound design. Starting with score and source music, the analysis emphasizes the programmatic use of music in 2001 as a method for constructing new relationships between established musical pieces and narrative and formal contexts. In this way, Whittington reveals points of synchronization and counterpoint between music and image (as well as dialogue and sound effects), rather than simply replicating traditional models of musical analysis. As a model for analysis, sound design directs our attention to the totality of the soundtrack-dialogue, music, effects, Foley, and ambience-rather than just to singular elements. The original definition of sound design-the conceptu alization of the soundtrack as an interrelated whole rather than industrially and ideologically segregated divisions of labor-has its roots in the work of Walter Murch, who chose the term "sound montage" to describe his contribution to George Lucas's feature-film debut, THX 1138 (1971). Working as one of the San Francisco-based filmmakers at Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope studio allowed Murch to function as sound recordist, editor, and mixer on the film-three jobs normally kept segregated by the sound unions in Los Angeles. Whittington devotes his second section to how Murch broke down these tradi tional barriers in order to create "suggestive fragments" of sound that resisted codes of realism, naturalism, or effacement in relation to the images. In his analy sis of Lucas's film, Whittington points out the functional aspects of sounds in their interplay with narrative details and thereby provides a model of formal analysis that emphasizes the functionality of the soundtrack rather than its construction. Subsequent sections refine this analytical approach and categorize the various operational aspects of sound design. Whittington's section on "sound designing" addresses Ben Burtt's recording and constructing of sounds for Star Wars (George Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 151</page><page sequence="3">Lucas, 1977) and the film's use of Dolby stereo. Given a year to collect and develop new sounds for the film's characters, vehicles, and weaponry, Burtt had free rein to experiment with the physical design of sounds from organic and manufactured sources. By manipulating and blending disparate sounds, he decontextualized them from their referents while leaving enough familiar traits to activate associations within the listener. Thus, according to Whittington, "sound does not simply at tempt to just conform to the physics of the diegesis. Rather, it engages the textual and/or emotional dynamics of the narrative."' By emphasizing the shift from sound capture to construction, Whittington attunes the reader to the notion of sound and image relations in cinema itself as a construction. Through subsequent case studies of Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979), Blade Run ner (Ridley Scott, 1982), and Terminator 2 (James Cameron, 1991), Whittington explores the function of audio editing, dialogue recording, and post-production sound mixing. This is especially evocative when he takes a cue from H. R. Giger's notion of "biomechanics" in Alien to examine the acoustic anthropomorphism created in many of the film's signature sound effects. Next, Whittington compares the use of voice-over in the 1982 theatrical version of Blade Runner to the 1992 director's cut, which eliminated the voice-over. And for Terminator 2, he uses Mary Ann Doane's 1980 "Ideology and the Practice of Sound Editing and Mix ing"2 to explore the structure of post-production sound mixing. Most intriguingly, he asserts that in science fiction, Doane's notion of the allowable and limited re lationships between the voice and image open up to "an ever-expanding palette of relationships between the voice and image."3 Finally, in his analysis of The Matrix franchise (Andy and Larry Wachowski, 1999-2003) across a number of different release platforms, Whittington leaves room for speculation about how digital convergence will further change the relationships between media sound and consumers. The result is one of the first extended analyses of the interplay between sound practices and genre considerations in American cinema. The book pro vides a strong model for how to understand the constructed nature of contempo rary film soundtracks and an analytical approach that places an emphasis on film sound's function as a complex, heterogeneous event, and it provides a practi cal framework to introduce the idea of film sound analysis. However, there are several other films that are briefly mentioned (A Clockwork Orange [Stanley Kubrick, 1971], Close Encounters of the Third Kind [Steven Spielberg, 1977]) or not mentioned at all (The Andromeda Strain [Robert Wise, 1971], Dune [David Lynch, 1984]) that would work just as well and bear further analysis. In addition, the position of the book between genre studies and sound studies means that it adds to both fields, but without advancing major new ground in ei ther. Whittington provides a canonical overview of science fiction and its critical literature, yet there are conspicuous absences in his presentation of sound theory and history. He relies heavily on works from sound theorists Mary Ann Doane,4 152 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="4">Alan Williams,5 and John Belton,' but other equally (if not more) important works from Rick Altman7 and Michel Chion8 are conspicuously absent. Moreover, the book's strict emphasis on mainstream American cinema may limit the under standing of wider industrial and aesthetic factors at work. For example, Whitting ton examines the influence of French New Wave filmmakers on new American cinema, yet it can be argued that the work of American avant-garde filmmakers may have had an even greater influence.9 Sound Design &amp; Science Fiction is a welcome addition to the growing num ber of publications on film sound. Extremely readable and copiously illustrated, the book offers an engaging analysis of the interplay between genre and sound prac tices, and it provides a model for future work on the subject. Ideally, it will initi ate similar studies into other genres and encourage readers to listen carefully and critically to cinema. Notes 1.
