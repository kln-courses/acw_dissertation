<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON INTENTIONAL MODIFICATION OF THE HUMAN FORM: IMPLICATIONS FOR ART EDUCATION DENNIS W. WHITE An area of concern within the field of American art education centers upon determining a proper foundation upon which curriculum designs and sub- sequent instructional procedures ought to be erected. It is this author's conten- tion that curriculum foundations within the context of a rapidly changing technostructural society should be created and evaluated in terms of the curriculum's structural ability to effec- tively serve individuals located within that society - individuals who are presently preparing to live into, and within, the next century. At least one baseline criterion for establishing evaluation procedures appropriate for technostructural-curricula is through determination of the degree to which such designs meaningfully incorporate the advancements of that society within their structure. To undertake such an evaluative procedure requires a con- tinuous review of advanced technical developments combined with a resolute effort to project the manner in which such accomplishments may affect curriculum considerations. Yet, accor- ding to McFee "the qualitative study of the man-made environment by art educators in the United States has been limited" (1969, p. 17). In an effort to illustrate how technological considerations may have a substantial bearing on curriculum for- mat this paper will call attention to re- cent achievements in microbiology and implications of that research for the specific purpose of intentional modification of the human form. It will also focus on the historical maturation of man's attempts to alter his human configuration throughout his social evolution. The latter attempt will be an effort to illustrate that the principle of actively seeking such change is a well- accepted fact in the course of human experience, regardless of the reasons by which man might seek to justify such alteration. Further, I will show that many of the modifications are in sub- stantial measure based upon artistic and aesthetic criteria. As a result of such standards the potential for self- determined modification of one's per- sonal form specifically indicates that the study of man's relation to his in- dividual structure is an area of en- vironmental consideration to which art educators should increasingly direct their attention. In part this position is supported by William Proweller's observation: What we have in the present discus- sion of art education is a paucity of the most immediate and fundamental structure that is basic to our initial living experiences - the role of the body which we are born with and never leave, but which from the professional perspective is entirely ig- nored. (1973, p. 13) Advancements in Microbiology Man's evolutional history has been the product of accidental gene for- mations, assemblages which in their specific form proved advantageous for survival within existing environmental conditions. Indeed, a most delightful speculation of why man's present struc- tural status materialized was developed by Desmond Morris (1967) in his work</page><page sequence="2">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION 17/3 The Naked Ape. Recent advances in microbiology are, however, beginning to seriously suggest that men in the future may be capable of self deter- mination of their form. The ac- complishment of intentional gene for- mation would mean that man would no longer be forced to accept unilaterally for himself the product produced by the process of random gene formation as currently is the case. A substantial step projecting the preceding possibility within realm of plausibility occured twenty-three years ago when James D. Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helixical shape of dioxyribonnucleic acid or DNA. This finding was of special interest since DNA is the basic molecular structure prescribing our species-specific human characteristics as well as the specifications for all living matter on earth. Since that initial finding researchers have attempted to unravel the inner secrets that such molecular compounds contain. Their efforts have focused on some of the following questions: How are DNA structures formed and bonded? How do they determine cellular activity at specific periods of maturation and inhibit those same actions at specific developmental points? Can DNA be created artificially or altered in its natural state? All of this research effort was an attempt to com- prehend and to eventually control with precision the formation of DNA linkages. To date researchers in microbiology have been able to synthesize a single strand of DNA in a test tube with the intrinsic ability to duplicate itself. In addition, it has been demonstrated that a virus DNA could nullify a bacterium's genetic instructions and replace it with its own as well as create an artificial virus that is, according to Theodore Friedmann and Richard Roblin, "in- distinguishable from its natural model" (1972, p. 17). This synthetic virus has been used to infect bacteria in an effort to successfully develop a new virus. This achievement projects the distinct possibility of developing pseudo-viruses as instruments for active use in curing man's diseases rather than as the causative factor. The potential of the technique is presently being tested in the treatment of two children having an hereditary inability to manufacture an enzyme required to prevent severe men- tal retardation (Friedmann &amp; Roblin, 1972, p. 17). With the finding that per- manent hereditable alteration of several cellular structures can result from inter- fusing a DNA extracted from a virus, it is increasingly postulated that genetic modification of specific human cell characteristics by external DNA is rapidly approaching operational status. The correction of defective natural DNA formations through the process of genetic surgery may become reality in the relatively near future with the use of laser beams slicing DNA molecules at desired points to burn out dysfunctional genes and subsequently replacing them with "DNA tailored in the test tube to emulate a properly functioning gene" (Friedmann &amp; Roblin, 1972, p. 16). Systematic development toward applying this form of cell hybridization to mammals has been undertaken, with reports indicating that such artificial cells have been developed in mixed cultures (Edward Tatum, 1966, p. 50). This technique of producing genetic mutations in a non-random manner has also resulted from chemical introduc- tion into an organism whereby "lab animals treated with hormones have un- dergone complete sexual transforma- tion. Embryos originally destined to be males turn out at birth to be females, capable of reproduction and vice versa" (Rorvik, 1971, p. 5). Jean Rostand (1971) has suggested that the new science of fetal surgery which is the actual removal, treatment and reimplantation of the developing 46</page><page sequence="3">A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON INTENTIONAL MODIFICATION fetus, "will shortly be routinely changing the subject's sex, the color of its eyes, the general proportions of body and limbs, and perhaps facial features" (p. 5). In the search for genetic control man has grown embryonic tissue of human beings that was to become skin and bone, and the same investigators are currently working on growing human eyes (Gordon Rathay Taylor, 1968, p. 69). The immediate implications of genetic investigation are extremely far reaching with the most striking prac- tical achievements to date occurring in agriculture. Through eugenic manipula- tion of chromosome numbers man has developed hybrid plants resistant to specific diseases deemed by him as un- desirable. This interfacing of efforts by basic and applied research in the area of microbiology has permitted a greater development within the food industry during the last fifty years than in all preceding history. Man's own genetic deficiencies are known to number at least 1,500, with 92 such disorders being specifically deter- mined as to their genetic cause. Present- ly these genetic abnormalities are usual- ly treated by dietary and/or drug therapy or gene product replacement therapy. Man is, however, rapidly moving toward the position of having capabilities of correcting and altering his naturally prescribed genetic struc- ture to suit his wishes. Ernst Mayr (1963) has observed that within man's historical development there has ap- parently been very little human genetic evolution during the last 30,000 years. He wrote: "Cro-magnon man differs physically from modern man no more than do various modern men from each other" (pp. 652-654). It should be noted that this period is also the same span of time in which man has witnessed his greatest socio-cultural change. Man's chronical forms of genetic diversifica- tion as the result of accidental com- binations substantially improved his ability to exploit additional habitats which presented themselves to him. From a biological-cultural perspective such genetic variety was necessary for man's continued development. The issue now raised due to recent technological progress in the area of mircobiology is: Will man, knowingly, seek to purposefully alter his genetic composition based on careful assemblages of genetic material with known structural results? For art educators the specific question based on the preceding issue is as follows: If future generations of man freely elect to genetically determine their personal condition, will aesthetic considerations play a significant role in such deter- minations? If the answer is favorable then the problem concerning curriculum formats based on consumer versus studio platforms as submitted by Lanier (1974) and Conant (1973) may in part become an academic question. This is so when consideration is given in the context that individuals of the future would become both consumer and artist of that medium which has resisted man's artistic efforts most successfully during his struggles for personal expres- sion, e. g., of course, his own human form. Historical Attempts at Body Modification Attempts by man to seek change of his micro-internal structure are known to have been accomplished as early as 1667 when the transfusion of blood from one living body to another was successfully undertaken (Fishlock, 1969, p. 154). More recently man mastered the problem of enhancing his ability to resist bacterial and viral infec- tion. As a result vaccination is daily practiced to deliberately modify man's vulnerability to smallpox, yellow fever, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, as well as tuberculosis and polio. For individuals 47</page><page sequence="4">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION 17/3 maintaining an inability to generate im- munity to various diseases due to lymphocyte deterioration the process of homotransplantation using normal bone marrow has been established ac- cording to Sherman M. Mellinkoff (1973, p. 105). Taylor (1968, p. 64) also noted that the concept of implantation and transplantation has been available to man from at least the sixteenth cen- tury, when attempts to correct teeth dis- orders occurred. Efforts to achieve organ transplanta- tion through surgical procedures have a history of success since 1954 when the first transference of a human kidney to another human being was ac- complished. Since this initial operation a multitude of transplants have been achieved including such organs as the lung, heart, pancreas, liver, and vagina which was attained as recently as 1975. The willingness of the American public to experience such drastic surgical alteration of man's original form is evi- dent in the 1967 kidney transplant registry report which noted that 1,200 individual operations of this type oc- cured in that year (Handler, 1970, p. 644). Acceptance of such medical procedure is further suggested by the fact that there were 17,364,000 surgical applications carried out in 1964 requiring some form of tissue reconstruction (Johnson-Hegyeli, 1971, p. 209). The preceding modifications have been based on the use of living tissue to accomplish desired internal changes. Increasingly, however, synthetic materials are being fabricated into soft tissue implants for use in repairing deviations from normal tissue con- ditions within the body. Such tissue im- plants replace or give support to liver and kidney wounds, cardiovascular dysfunctions, deteriorated blood vessels, destroyed skin, and damaged corneas. In addition they serve as channels for nerve regeneration, replacement of various tubular struc- tures within the body, bulk tissue sub- stitutes, replacement of eyeballs, and reconstruction of facial defects. The use of new plastics and alloys has allowed substantial improvements in surgical implants requiring a more rigid com- position. These implants are used in replacement of joints, bones, chest walls, diaphragms, artifical heart walls, tendons, tear ducts, ear drums, urethras and substitutional grafts. Public recep- tivity of such structural modifications in 1973 resulted in 100,000 arterial grafts, 45,000 heart value inserts and 200,000 cerebrospinal fluid shunts (mechanical devices for relieving pressure within the brain). James Goddard (1973, p. 165) also observed that an estimated ad- ditional 150,000 Americans were equipped with electronic heart pacemakers, and that the rate of such installations had surpassed 50,000 per year. The practice of using phar- macological agents for the purpose of modifying or reestablishing homeostatic conditions within man is an ancient art. The contemporary clinical application is regularly used for the purpose of depressing elements of the brain periodically leading to epilep- tical seizures (Mellindokk, 1973, p. 108); reestablishing normal cardiac rhythm (Handler, 1970, p. 673);and in- ducing changes in prevailing psy- chological states. Acceptance of oral drugs for modification of the internal condition of man is graphically il- lustrated from a survey conducted for the magazine Drug Topics in 1971. The survey noted that the dollar volume of all package medicines in the United States sold at retail without a prescrip- tion was 2.9 billion dollars. Including prescription medication the sum assumed the proportion of 6 billion dollars (Goddard, 1973, p. 63). As a result of medical advancements in the last fifty years, reconstructive 48</page><page sequence="5">A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON INTENTIONAL MODIFICATION plastic surgery has been established as a surgical speciality. Such surgical techniques in our modern society play an important role in physical as well as psychological rehabilitation of victims suffering from crippling diseases and accidents. This role is in addition to the part plastic surgery serves for persons desiring cosmet;i alteration based sole- ly on the foundation of aesthetic choice. Silas Braley (1967, p. 165) has pointed out that the use of silicones for the pur- pose of reconstructive surgery finds dai- ly use in the form of noses, ears, cheeks, chins and breasts. The exercise of decorative defor- mations and personal mutilations for various social and individual con- siderations has a long history in man's cultural maturation. Living testimony to this behavioral choice is vividly il- lustrated in the life of the Australian Arunta, a neolithic aborigine. The Arunta have for multiple centuries un- dertaken the surgical techniques of cir- cumcision, subincision, and bloodlet- ting to assist the male through puberty (Service, 1963, p. 20). The Maya of Meso-American performed the practice of cranial deformation, an activity also exercised according to E. Adamson Hoebel (1958, pp. 323-24) by various Indian tribes of the American Northwest. Plucking out body hair as a primitive form of body alteration was common practice by the Yahgan of South America, as was the piercing of one's ears for the purpose of receiving thin diskl up to 8 inches in diameter by the Inca peoples of Peru (Durant, 1954, p. 83). Burmese women continue to the present the practice of separating the cervical vertebra for the purpose of extending the height of their necks with the assistance of ringed brass collars. While in other parts of the world the filing of, or knocking out of, incisor teeth remains a continued custom (Hoebel, 1958, pp. 250-52). Many cultures continue to encourage piercing of the nasal septum, the lips or ears so that bones, feathers, wood or metal or- naments (often referred to as jewelry in "civilized societies") may be shoved through them for cosmetic reasons. Two other practices for permanently altering the human appearance are those ornamental embellishments im- pressed upon the body in the form of tattooing and scarification. Each form of personal embellishment may extend over the body, face, and limbs, and in a few cases have, according to Hoebel (1958, p. 248), even extended to the tongue. Extensive attempts to attain modification of the external features of the body on a non-permanent basis have resulted in the almost universal practice of painting the body. This form of per- sonal and social expression has included such parts as finger and toe nails, eyes, and other prominent and not so promi- nent facial areas. The famous historian Will Durant has submitted that it is likely that the oldest form of art expres- sion on a pictorial surface by man was probably in the form of body painting (1954, p. 14). Additional efforts to alter the body's visual image encompassed trimming and removing body hair through the use of chemical depilatories or mechanical instruments such as scissors, the styling of it, or the seeking to replace hair which has been lost through the process of natural genetic causes by the wearing of hairpieces or surgical implantation. Archaeological evidence from the Upper Paleolithic era in Europe gives overt evidence to man's concern for hair styling as in- dicated in the statues of the Venuses of Willendorf which portray the con- siderable effort by a long forgotten ar- tist to project the styles of his time. Continuing manifestations of man's desire to free himself from his historical dependence upon accidental genetic connections may be witnessed in those daily forms of grooming exercised by 49</page><page sequence="6">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION 17/3 man. The use of scented soaps, per- fumes, underarm and body deodorants, toothpaste, and,mouth washes as well as lotions, pastes, and powders used either in isolation or in combination with those techniques previously mentioned are purposeful attempts to alter the texture, color, feel, and smell of the body, in addition to modifying the visual impression submitted for public approval. Optical instruments in the form of eye glasses are used by tens of millions of Americans to correct vision abnor- malities through appropriate magnification or proper alignment of light waves. Contact lenses offer the in- dividual the opportunity to transform the apparent eye color to those hues considered more aesthetically desirable. Pupil shape may also be changed through the use of such lens. Auditory deficiencies as a result of sensory im- pairment is another area of genetic in- adequacy through natural evolution which causes at least 8.5 million Americans a handicap of sufficient severity to impede their social efficien- cy. At least 900,000 persons in the United States take advantage of a mechanical hearing aid to assist their comprehension of the spoken word and thus overcome their genetic problem. The incapacitational effects of in- ferior gene structures resulting in degenerative circulatory and com- municative diseases, as well as physical impairment, limited more than 60 million persons in the United States in their daily activities (Handler, 1970, p. 631). A recent research study conducted by Thomas and Mayer also indicated that even the problem of perceived un- wanted fat is the concern of at least half of the middle aged persons (1973, p. 74). An undetermined number of ad- ditional individuals suffer from percep- tions of being too thin, too tall, or too short, and all mankind suffers from the destructive deteriorational effects of aging. The present latitude man has in altering his form can, to a limited degree, be determined by the extremes which have been exhibited by that form. Weight factors have varied from 13 Ibs. to 1,069 pounds, and man has managed to extend his longevity to a record 113 years 124 days. The plasticity of the neck permitted an elevation of the head from the shoulder a distance of 15 1/2 inches. Man's current ability to tolerate temperature variations has been limited to a maximum spectrum of 54.2 degrees, with the high being 115 and the low 60.8. That sensory mechanisms of man can possibly be more effective than normally experienced is suggested by a recorded case of visual acuity 20 times more efficient than the average expecta- tion. The individual with this unusual genetic condition was able to identify persons at a distance of more than a mile. Self-induced variation permitted one person to reduce from a weight of 802 pounds to 232 pounds in a three- year period, a loss of 570 pounds (McWhirter and McWhirter, 1975, pp. 15-34). On the foundation of this admittedly cursory overview of man's desire and ability to experience change of his struc- tural form it appears evident that man has continually sought to master his own form with whatever technology was currently available to him for that pur- pose. The Human Form in Multi-Media Representation The use of the human form as a means of personal and social expression has a parallel development in the rich history of artistic explorations in other media which have been executed in various eras of man's social and cultural evolution. The Paleolithic Willendorf Statuette exhibits the artist's concern with selected segments of the human anatomy and their relation to fertility. 50</page><page sequence="7">A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON INTENTIONAL MODIFICATION This concern is graphically indicated in the extraordinary attention to the but- tocks, breast, and lower abdomen through utilization of repeated bulbous shapes. Later Egyptian Pharaohs were to use the human form chiseled in stone to present not only the individuality of the king to their subjects but the sym- bolic portfolio of imperturbable calm associated with the king's abiding power. The incorporation of animal features with the human form is a repeated theme in the annals of artistic history. Assyrians merged wings with a lion- shouldered, human-headed deity while the Egyptians sought to fashion the Sphinx with a body of a lion and the head of a human being, framed by the royal head-dress. Even in the present society the combination of animal parts with the form of man is not unknown, as is evident in the contemporary prac- tice of portraying Satan with the horns, hoofs and tail of a bull. The anthropomorphic habit of projecting human personality characteristics to cartoon caricatures may be considered another extension of this theme, as can the mythical form identified with mer- maids. A different modification of the ar- tistic representation of the human figure emerged in the Cretan idealistic por- trait where the figure-style sought to create an image identified with a proud, self-confident bearing. Romans were later to use sculptural representations of the human form to illustrate the em- bodiment of social order, which in its Gestalten supereminented the in- dividual. The Emperor Augustus, in the Prima Porta is a clear example of this direction. Within the current matrix of society the ethos of the man is predominantly projected through the lens of still, motion and television cameras. In the more recent past Vincent Van Gogh endeavored to give his works an evangelical expression of psychic experience. His attempts epitomized, through artistic reflection, man's growing comprehension of the inner dimensions of his being. The present era in man's evolution is marked by cons- tant experimentation. The artist who is considered by many to have most clear- ly represented this phenomena in his personalized expressions is Pablo Picasso. His depictions of the human character encompass the seemingly realistic, the fracturing of the pictorial plane to attain temporal space, and the purposeful distortion of color and shape to emphasize states of emotional at- tachment through rational incongruity. His collective works serve as an un- adulterated reminder of the influence technology has had upon personal and social forms of artistic expression with respect to the human form. It is evident that even a brief, segmented view of man's attempts toward representation of the human form supports the concept that such endeavors mirror the temporal space and cultural ideology from which they spring. As technology has allowed man to give expanded fruition to his ideas through media more flexible and responsive to his needs, man's selections of artistic forms for communication have substantially enlarged both in style and form. One can but wonder what effect plastic, acrylic paint, laser beam projections, and computer art would have had on the artistic creations of the past. Today mankind rests on the threshold of a new exploration and treatment of an old medium - the human body itself. The present situa- tion is analogous to the movement of our ancestors from the medium of clay to stone, and from stone to bronze figure representations. The major difference which perhaps delineates the current movement from those in the past is the current society's ability to prepare its citizens for the forthcoming 51</page><page sequence="8">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION 17/3 event. Even as this paper is being read it serves to familiarize the reader with events which are rapidly unfolding and, in this capacity, may be viewed as a mechanism for acculturation. It is only one instrument within an assortment of such tools of which the present society avails itself for the purpose of attemp- ting to minimize resistance of its citizens to change. Major television networks are even now seeking to prepare the general population for the day when they no longer will be solely dependent on their natural genetic state. Current programs such as the Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Space:1999, and the recent cloning episode on the Mystery Theater serve as examples of this undertaking. Daily publications in combination with weekly, biweekly, and monthly periodicals, as well as professional literature, in like manner prepare the citizenry by announcing new medical and scientific breakthroughs aimed at improving man's present state. Within the milieu of efforts to reduce individual non-acceptance of change resulting from technological progress, what is the place of education and specifically art education? It is to this question atten- tion is now directed. Art Education and the Future of the Human Form Accelerated development of man's capacity to radically and extensively alter his sculptural configuration by means of self restraint, genetic engineering, surgical procedures, drug administration, and cosmetic additions may well force mankind to modify or eliminate many of the norms upon which aesthetic judgments are es- tablished. The challenge may well force man to reach to the very depths of his beliefs. The ensuing transition may create a condition of stress as extensive as yet experienced by man in the unfurling of his physical and social evolution. The process of cultural-shock inherently generated by technological achievement may be tempered if appropriate means of social transition can be developed and instituted. As previously observed, steps in this direction have already been attempted through the various com- munication media. The approaches to date have been, however, neither systematic nor coordinated. The present condition requires a more comprehen- sive, synchronized, and well formulated approach if the society is to triumphant- ly thread this period of change. Thus, it becomes ever important that educators increasingly commence an educational format commensurate with man's technological advancements. No longer may the pedagogical sphere exercise its entrusted responsibility of educating students for the future by predominant- ly focusing its efforts on either existing or past accomplishments - events which in themselves are but antecedent movements toward the future. Educational interests must turn atten- tion toward those possible future con- ditions which are reasonable outcomes of present technology and personal- social inclinations. As Eisner noted: The forty-three million children and youths who attend American schools are entitled to encounter educational programs that result from the application of the sophisticated tools we have available. The content of their programs should develop skills and ideas of enormous power and style, skills and ideas which will en- dure beyond the ephemeral demands of the present. (1971, p. 164) The determination of what men deem aesthetically pleasing and the mechanisms through which they gain such dispositions is considered ap- propriate for study within the field of art education. Another area generally accepted as viable for investigation is the study of various media for the pur- pose of creating a personalized form of artistic expression. Yet, only limited 52</page><page sequence="9">A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON INTENTIONAL MODIFICATION research has been undertaken within the field which is concerned with deter- mining those factors contributing to the formation of aesthetic standards used to evaluate the human form. Even less in- vestigatory work has been actively pur- sued for the purpose of establishing the means by which man has traditionally used his own form as a personal medium of expression. Up to the pre- sent, both the manipulation of the human form as an art medium and the associated foundations of aesthetic judgments have been essentially limited to parameters established by accidental combinations of genetic material. What will occur when such combinations are no longer accidental? These are the con- cerns to which art educators and society in general must direct attention. Freed from the ancient norms for prescribing beauty as it relates to himself and his peers, would each individual seek to generate his own idiomorphic standard of what suggests beauty? Would the in- dividual's ability to restructure the human form set the stage for elimina- tion of those age old barriers which have existed between groups of in- dividuals based on the particular color on one's skin, hair texture, body shape, or specific genetic treatment of the eyes, mouth or ears? How many persons of the present generation would not avail themselves of the opportunity to modify their own form given the choice, par- ticularly, if the freedom of such action allowed for the purposefully arranged, skillfully created, and economically designed form aimed at encouraging a specific social response? A central point of this exploratory consideration is whether art educators ought, should, or need to become ac- tively immersed in the movement toward intentional modification of the human form. If art educators accept Ir- ving Kaufman's observation that "art forces the acknowledgement of the stu- dent as homo faber, man the maker" (1971, p. 93), then we need to begin the process of more freely allowing man the opportunity to focus upon himself as maker of himself with the strength and wisdom that can be brought to bear on the subject. It would seem a strange in- congruity if man, upon instituting the means for extensive modification and development within the genetic mosaic of all living organisms, would chose to abort simultaneously, for whatever reason, efforts directed toward the specific determination of his own biological basis. This paper has attempted to project that the history of man, with respect to the concept of self- determined alteration, supplies ample evidence suggesting that man does not currently, nor has he in the past, con- sidered himself the apogee of perfection upon which improvement could not be accomplished. The material submitted for consideration indicates quite the op- posite, i.e., that man, since his incep- tion, has been fully cognizant of his weaknesses. In consequence of that realization man has steadfastly through this social evolution sought to attain explicit and precise management over those natural forces which in union created him. Furthermore, as man's technological creations have assembled themselves one upon another, man has, where possible, attempted to apply those developments to the improvement of himself and his means of media con- trol for the purpose of outward self- expression - expression, which, in whatever form it maintains, gives frui- tion to man's ideas. The Commission for the Study of Visual Arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has put forth the position that a visual arts program should "draw attention to the human control of form and space and color no matter where it occurs" (1957, p. 71). When this statement is joined with Ed- 53</page><page sequence="10">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION 17/3 mund Burke Feldman's belief that "the whole man-made world becomes the subject matter for aesthetic education" (1971, pp. 116-117), it seems clear that art education should proceed to accept at least part of the responsibility for awakening in our citizens the present and potential meaning of the human form as an appropriate personalized avenue for artistic expression and aesthetic experience. In summary, the salient premise of this paper is that man in the relatively near future will actively seek to alter his structural-sculptural shape, not in justifiable response to pathological causes or accidental deformation but as a purposeful statement of himself as a unique entity requiring an equally u- nique form to express and communicate this distinction. Research on the Human Form There has been limited research un- dertaken by art educators on the idea of the human form as a medium for per- sonal expression. Thus, the following suggestions are submitted as possible points of departure: 1. Identification of those environmen- tal factors which give rise to personal and social determination concerning aesthetic considerations of the human form; 2. Isolation of those spatial periods within the individual's development continuum which appear most critical in the development of personal preference toward consideration of the human form as a medium for aesthetic experience and artistic expression; 3. Determination of maturational periods within the milieu of human development when the introduction of a specific curriculum, designed to create a more enlightened perspective toward the attitude of the human form as per- sonal medium for artistic expression, would be most appropriate; 4. Development of curriculum and instructional methods specifically designed to allow individual exploration of those historical results, both personal and social, which derived from applying past technologies to the purposeful changing of the human form.
