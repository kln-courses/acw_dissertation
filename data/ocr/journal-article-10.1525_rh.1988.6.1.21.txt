<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> BRIAN VICKERS  The Atrophy of Modem Rhetoric, Vico to De Man*  ust when, and how, rhetoric lost its key position in the  humanities is an issue that its historians have yet to settle.  From the fourteenth to the seventeenth centaries—from  Petrarch to Dryden—rhetoric enjoyed an unrivalled doirunance  not just within the trivium but as the only fully worked-out com- munication system. It provided compositional models and essen- tial concepts and categories in poetry, prose, drama, legal debate,  preaching, history-writing, and even science; whUe it was taken  over to provide an aesthetic system, not always satisfactory, for  music and the fine arts.' But in the eighteenth centary its hege- mony came under attack. It stUl continued to be taught, schools and  universities maintaining their usual conservatism over curricula.  *An excerpt from the concluding chapter of In Defence of Rhdoric, copyright  1988 by Oxford University Press.

New  and independent aesthetic systems emerged, as both the visual  arts and music rejected the dominance of language and language- based criteria.^ The rhetorical tradUion itself seems to lose vitahty,  and although we have as yet no reliable history or bibhography of  the dissemination of rhetoric texts in this period, my unpression is  that the general attitades of rhetoric had been absorbed by a liter- ary cultare some of whose members rejected its detaU, and espe- ciaUy its technicaUties. It is not the case of rhetoric being ousted at  one go, for we know that the first generation Romantic poets were  stUl under its influence. Goethe made notes from Quintihan, and  in 1815 stUl held the view of Isocrates, Cicero, or Vives that rhetoric  is indispensable to humaruty: as Curtius says, "in him the entire  European tradition was aUve."^ Wordsworth quotes QuintUian  with approval, as do Macaulay, Disraeli, and John Staart MUl."  Cicero continued to be a living part of the educated Englishman or  American's cultare until well into the nineteenth centary.^ De Quin- cey, writing in 1828, declared that "the age of Rhetoric, like that of  Chivalry, has passed among forgotten things"—even though his  own prose style is as full of antithesis, balance, and more exuber- ant figures of speech as a Hellenistic romance.^ But that year saw  the publication in London of Richard Whately's Elements of Rhetoric  (seven editions by 1846), while in Paris Pierre Fontanier published  in 1818 a Commentaire raisonne on the Traite des tropes (1730) by  C. Chesnau Du Marsais (1676-1730), from whom Diderot and  D'Alembert had commissioned the articles on grammar for the  Grande Encyclopedic (he died before he could write them).

Flaubert,  stadying at the Rouen lycee, used a manual containing "les pre- ceptes du genre et des modeles d'exercices." His extant juvenUia,  written in 1835-36, when he was in the fourth form, include six  "narrations" (five historical novellas and a portrait of Byron), which  are extensions of his homework. As Gerard Genette has said, "pour  un adolescent de cette epoque, 'se lancer dans la Utteratare' n'etait  done pas, comme aujourd'hui, une aventare et une ruptare: c'etait  le prolongement—on dirait volontiers I'aboutissement normal d'un  cycle d'etades bien conduites."* Such manuals as Girardin's De  I'instrudion publique (1838) followed a tradition going back three  centiuies, laying down that pupUs in the second form should learn  the figures of rhetoric, and compose narrations in Latin and French,  graduating in the following years to the more demanding texts of  Fontaruer. It was not until the reforms of 1885 and 1902 that "rhe- torique" was suppressed as a subject in the state lycees, and re- placed by the history of Uteratare.' Besides the flourishing of  the classical tradition in the nineteenth centary, one could show  the emergence of new rhetorics in poetry and prose, so that De  Quincey's obitaary of 1828 can be seen to be prematare.  No doubt stadies of other European literatares would show the  same pattern. To give just one example from Germany, the great  dramatist Georg Biichner attended the Darmstadt Gymnasium  from 1825 to 1831, and had the traditional classical education.  'See Gerard Genette's editions of Fontanier, Les figures du discours (Paris, 1968)  and of Fontanier's re-edition of Du Marsais, Le traite des tropes (Geneva, 1967).

Bowman, Le discours sur I'doquence sacree a I'epoque romantique. Rhdorique, apologdi- que, hermdieutique (1777-1851) (Geneva, 1980).  "See B.

His "Abitarien- tenrede," Menenius Agrippa addressing the Roman people, is lost,  but from his "Rede zur Verteidigung des Cato von UtU&lt;a" (1830) it  is but a short step to the pohtical rhetoric ui his first major work,  Dantons Tod (1835)."  The history of the continuity of rhetoric in the eighteenth and  nineteenth centaries has yet to be written. A true history might  show the persistence of traditional rhetorical instruction in the  schools, untU the rise of modern subjects caused realignments in  the curriculum which gave rhetoric an ever smaUer and more spe- ciaUzed share. The traditional coupling of "rhetoric and belles  lettres" persisted in Scotland, where chairs of English hteratare  StUl had the words "rhetoric" or "oratory" in then title (as is the  case in Edinburgh to this day), but in English schools rhetoric was  relegated to the classics departments, and the growth of classical  phUology in the nineteenth centary, generaUy hostile to rhetoric,  separated it stUl further from literatare and general composition.  Almost the last place where you can find the figures and tropes of  rhetoric listed in a practical educational text is in a brief appendix  to Kennedy's Latin Primer. The marginalization of rhetoric resulted  in its relegation to the realm of the unusual, a collection of pecu- liarities of language or style lacking any central relation to impor- '°See Gerhard Schaub, Georg Biichner und die Schulrhdorik (Berne and FraiJcfurt,  1975).

Thus Gerald Brenan records how, at a prep  school in Winchester before the first World War, the pedantry of a  classics master made the whole of rhetoric unpalatable. The head- master took the senior boys (aged twelve or thereabouts) for Greek,  and would make them  construe Homer or Xenophon. If he was in a good mood puns would  fly about and sweets be distributed, but if he frowned one had to be  careftU. Yet he was not a good teacher. He made no attempt whatever  to arouse our interest in what we were reading. Either he made jokes  about the Homeric epithets or else he set us searching for odd figures  of speech, as though they were the principal objects of interest in  Uterature. What I remember from these hours is chiefly therefore a  rag-bag of onomatopoeias, oxymorons, hypallages, anacoluthons,  hysteron-proterons and so forth—all of course quite pointless."^  Or rather, deprived of point.  The progressive decline of rhetoric may have been due to nata- ral causes, but it was certainly aggravated by a number of attacks  coming, as so often in the past, from the camp of the phUosophers,  influential in then own day and much stadied in ours, whose dia- tribes have attracted more attention than the historical fact of conti- nuity. To name but three: John Locke, in his Essay Concerning Hu- man Understanding (1690; revised up to 1706; dozens of editions and  translations by 1800) dismissed rhetoric as "that powerful instru- ment of Error and Deceit." Immanuel Kant, ui his Kritik der Urteils- kraft (1790), or "Critique of Aesthetic Judgement," made a more  sustamed and violent attack on rhetoric as "the art of playing for  one's own purpose upon the weaknesses of men" and judged that  U "merits no respect whatever." Benedetto Croce, in the holistic or  monist theory enshrined in his Estdica (1900) rejected rhetoric, as  he did any system that would distu\guish between style and con- tent, idea and expression. The statas of Croce is not as great as that  of Locke or Kant, but he was undoubtedly influential in Italy.''  Attacked from without, weakening within, rhetoric went  °A Life of One's Own.

One  can indeed speak of a "Renaissance of rhetoric" in our own time,  but it is a revival from the viewpoint of the historian. That is, we  have recovered much of the cultaral significance of rhetoric from  classical antiquity to 1700; we have better texts, better commen- taries than ever before; and we know much more about its impact  on individual writers. The vogue for rhetoric has even reached  the point where the word is used quite indiscrimuiately in book  titles—this journal might sponsor an annual competition to find  the least meaningful use of "rhetoric" in a book title—and in pub- lishers' announcements.'" But this whole movement has been a his- torical movement, after the event, as it were, committed to under- standing rhetoric, not to using it.  Another tradition exists, however, m which rhetoric contmues  to be used as a model for writing history—the history of civUiza- tions, or manners, or cultare. This, too, has suffered atrophy over  the last three centaries, for rather than using the whole range of  rhetorical processes (inventio, dispositio . . .) or rhetorical modes  (demonstrative, deliberative, judicial), it has reduced rhetoric not  just from a primary to secondary role—from oral to written com- munication—but to elocutio alone, now detached from its expres- sive and persuasive functions, and brought down finally to a hand- ful of tropes. It is not easy to reconstruct the process by which this  atrophying has come about, but one name sometimes evoked as  exemplar is that of Vico. In his New Science,^^ discussing "Poetic  "A recently announced series by the University of Wisconsin Press is called  "Rhetoric of the Human Sciences," which will analyze "various disciplines, not as  the 'sciences' they sometimes claim to be, but as 'rhetorics'—that is, as systems of  belief and practice, each of which has its own characteristic form and structure,"  announcement in The New York Review of Books, 30 January 1986, p. 17. This is to  widen the meaning of rhetoric to the point of no return.  '^Quotations are from The New Science of Giambattisto Vico, rev. trans, of tfiird  ed. (1744), by T. G. Bergin and M. H. Fisch (Ithaca, N.Y., 1968), with references in- corporated into the text. Several earlier rhetoricians designated four "basic" tropes:  see, for example, Audomarus Talaeus, Rhetorica (Paris, 1548); P. Ramus, Rhetoricae  Distindiones in Quintilianum (1549), trans. C. Newlands as Arguments in Rhetoric  Against Quintilian (DeKalb, 111., 1986), pp. 28, 134-42; Abraham Fraunce, The Arca- dian Rhetorike (London, [1588]; facs. ed. Menston, 1969), Sig. Bjr; Thomas Famaby,  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Atrophy of Modem Rhetoric 27  logic," which "considers thuigs in all the forms by which they may  be signified" (p. 127, §400), Vico argues that the first form taken by  language was anthropomorphic metaphor, for "the first poets at- tributed to bodies the being of animate substances, with capacities  measured by theh own, namely sense and passion, and in this way  made fables of them. Thus every metaphor so formed is a fable in  brief," and metaphor remains "the most luminous and therefore  the most necessary and frequent" of all the tropes (p. 129, §404).  After the mvention of metaphor, Vico beUeves, foUowed metonymy,  the substitation of agent for act resultuig from "the fact that names  for agents were commoner than names for acts," and that of sub- ject for form and accident being due to the early poets' "inabUity to  abstract forms and quahties from subjects" (p. 130, §406). The third  trope Vico considers is synecdoche, which, he claims, "developed  into metaphor as particulars were elevated into universals or parts  united with the other parts together with which they make up their  wholes" (p. 130, §407). Vice's speculative history of the genesis of  tropes ends with irony, which, he thinks, "could not have begun  untU the period of reflection, because it is fashioned of falsehood  by dint of a reflection which wears the mask of truth" (p. 131, §408).  That really marks the extent of Vico's interest in the tropes,  which are brought in not as rhetorical devices in their own right  but as stages in a hypothetical scheme of the evolution of language  and poetry. But before leaving the topic he makes a further reduc- tive gestare:  From aU this it follows that all the tropes (and they are all reducible to the  four types above discussed), which have hitherto been considered in- genious inventions of writers, were necessarily modes of expression  of all the first poetic nations, and had originaUy their full native pro- priety. But these expressions of the first nations later became figura- tive when, with the further development of the human mind, words  were invented which signified abstract forms or genera comprising  their species or relating parts with their wholes (p. 131, §409; my  itaUcs).

Who originated the practice?  </page> <page sequence="8"> 28 R H E T O R I C A  Behind Vico's theory of the genesis of tropes one can just see the  traditional argument of rhetoricians that eloquence was nataral be- fore it became systematized into an art. Like other rhetoricians,  Vico uses this arguement as a tool to attack a neighboring disci- pline, wishing to "overthrow . . . two common errors of gram- marians." But his reduction of the tropes to four is unfortanate,  and in fact unworkable, as anyone wiU see who tries to reduce  prosopopoeia, antiphrasis, onomatopoeia, antonomasia, or hyperbole to  one of the privileged four. Each of these tropes has a specific na- tare, and a specific role to play in the elaboration of discourse, so  that to claim that aU the others may be ignored can only impover- ish rhetoric. Vico seems to be the source—typicaUy, unacknowl- edged—behind Kenneth Burke's adding to one of his books an ap- pendix discussing "Four Master Tropes," namely the same four,  metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony.'* Burke also subor- dinates them to his own concerns, free-wheeling, allusive, unhis- torical phUosophizing, a system that rearranges the components of  classical rhetoric so idiosyncratically as to be vutaaUy unusable.  Vico is the acknowledged inspiration for the "four trope" the- ory of the contemporary American historian Hay den White,'' who  has revived the ancient (if somewhat confusing) term "tropics" to  describe "the tropical element in aU discourse" (p. 1). White be- Ueves that this element is "inexpungeable from discourse in the hu- man sciences, however realistic they may aspire to be," for "tro- pics is the process by which all discourse constitutes the objects"  which it then describes and analyzes (p. 2). The "tarning" of words  and thoughts effected by tropes allows us to move from "one no- tion of the way things are related" to another, and to see that the  connection between things "can be expressed in a language that  takes account of the possibUity of their being otherwise" (ibid.). So  "A Grammar of Motives (New York, 1945), pp. 503-17. Burke's debt to Vico is  clear in such passages as these: "If you trail language back far enough, of course,  you will find that all our terms for 'spiritual' states were metonymie in origin.  Language develops by metaphorical extension, in borrowing words from the realm  of the corporeal, visible, tangible and applying them by analogy to the realm of the  incorporeal, invisible, intangible, then in the course of time the corporeal reference  is forgotten. ." (p. 506).  "Tropics of Discourse. Essays in Cultural Criticism (Baltimore, Md., 1978), refer- ences in the text. For a corrective to White, see the wide ranging study by Eckhard  Kessler, "Das rhetorische Modell der Historiographie," in R. Koselleck, H. Lutz,  and J. Riisen, eds., Formen der Geschichtsschreibung (Munchen, 1982), pp. 37-85.  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Atrophy of Modem Rhetoric 29  White indhecfly refutes Croce's morusm, and justifies the adaptive  power of language. No text, he goes on, "can represent 'things as  they are' without rhetorical adorrunent or poetic imagery," and  even the syUogism works by using synecdoche and metonymy as it  moves "from the plane of universal propositions to singular exis- tential statements" (p. 3). I agree with some of WhUe's principles,  and I endorse his comment that those thinkers (he cites Vico, Rous- seau, Hegel, and Nietzsche) who held that the first languages de- rived from tropes and figures did not oppose these "prefigurative  modes of cogrution" to "rational modes," and were interested in  uitegration rather than opposition (p. 7). But I cannot do much  with his claim to have discovered an "archetypal plot of discursive  formations" which moves, in Vico's sequence but for a different  purpose, from metaphor to metonymy to synecdoche to irony.  White daims to find this pattern in Piaget's division of chUdren's  cogrutive development into four phases ("sensorimotor, represen- tational, operational, and logical"); in Freud's interpretation of  dreaming (condensation, displacement, representation, secondary  revision); in Marx, and in Hegel (pp. 6-20). In another essay he  finds the same "quarternary pattern" in the levels of interpretation  in historical narrative, which are "structarally homologous with one  another" (p. 70). So to the four "basic tropes," metaphor, synec- doche, metonymy, irony, correspond four "modes of emplotment"  (romance, comedy, tragedy, sathe), four "modes of explanation"  (idiographic, organistic, mecharustic, contextaalist), four "modes  of ideological implication" (anarchist, conservative, radical, lib- eral), and four nineteenth-centary historians (Michelet, Tocque- vUle, Ranke, Burckhardt: pp. 70-4). This is an unusual recurrence  of a technique that I have called "category-fit," common in the oc- cult sciences,'* and a venerable way of making sense of the world.  But as far as rhetoric is concerned. White's practice is doubly un- fortanate, being not only reductive in its concern with four trOpes  orUy, but also subordinating them to a different and, let it be said,  alien interest.  The other tradition behind the atrophying of rhetoric in modern  theory reduces the tropes to two orUy, metaphor and metonymy.  The instigator of this reduction was of course Roman Jakobson,  "See Brian Vickers, "On the Function of Analogy in the Occult," in A. Debus  and I. Merkel, eds., Hermdism and the Renaissance (Cranbury, N.J., 1988), pp. 269-92.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 30 R H E T O R I C A  who wanted to apply "purely linguistic criteria to the interpretation  and classification" of aphasia." I have italicized the term that shows  how rhetoric has once again been subordinated to another disci- pline, here Imguistics, especially the kmd practiced by Jakobson,  which never shook off the influence of structaralist phonology and  its concern with bmary opposUions. Any Unguistic sign, according  to Jakobson, "involves two modes of arrangement" of its constita- ent parts, combination and substitation or selection, these two  ways of treating constitaent signs yieldUig the "context" of a Un- guistic unit and the "code" (pp. 60-1). So the "constitaents of a  context," he argues, can be thought to be "in a state of contiguity,  whUe in a substitation set signs are linked by various degrees of  similarity," fluctaating between synonyms and antonyms (ibid.).  These two operations, contiguity and similarity, "provide each Un- guistic sign with two sets of interprdants," to use the terminology  of C. S. Peirce, two references "which serve to interpret the sign—  one to the code, and the other to the context" (pp. 61-2). Jakob- son's binary system, finaUy, allows him to distinguish two types of  aphasics, those with "Similarity Disorder" and those with "Con- tiguity Disorder," and it is at this point that he invokes rhetoric,  claiming that the two types correspond to the tropes metaphor and  metonymy.  Before examining Jakobson's argument, it may be worth recaU- ing the meaning of these terms in rhetoric. "By a trope," Quintihan  writes, "is meant the artistic alteration of a word or phrase from its  proper meaning to another." The alteration involves not just words  but "our thoughts and the structare of our sentences," so that  those writers are "mistaken who have held that tropes necessarUy  involved the substitation of one name for another," such as indi- cating an invention by substitating the name of the inventor (Vul- can for fire, Ceres for bread), or substitating "that which contains  for that which is contained" ("a cup was drunk to the lees," imply- ing a cup of wine), or cause for effect ("slothful ease"), or vice- versa (8.6.23).^° Synecdoche gives "variety to our language by mak- ing us reaUze many things from one, the whole from a part, the  ""Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances," in  R. Jakobson and M. Halle, Fundamentals of Language (The Hague, 1956), pp. 53 - 82; references in the text.  ^°H. E. Butler, trans., Loeb Classical Library, 4 vols.

Other rhetoricians agree substantially, or are  more explicit, such as the author of the Ad Herennium, describing  metonymy as "the figure which draws from an object closely akin  or associated [ab rebus propinquis et finitimis] an expression suggest- ing the object meant, but not called by its own name," substitating  greater for lesser, instrument for possessor, and so on (4.32.43).^'  Metaphor, as everyone knows, involves describing one thing or con- cept in terms of another, so as to relate or combine attributes not  commonly associated. Antonomasia is "the substitation of an epi- thet as equivalent to the name which it replaces," or "indicating the  most striking characteristics of an individual, as in the phrase 'Fa- ther of gods and king of men.'" Periphrasis and aUegory are large- scale ways of using one verbal sequence to describe another; irony  and related tropes substitate a form of discourse that means the  opposite of what seems to be said.  All the tropes, then, work by a form of substitation based on  resemblance and difference, with the listener or reader being ex- pected to make the mental operations necessary to relate one term to  another within the same class. In one context "Mars" wUl be a  metonymy for "war," "gold" for "wealth," "Venus" for "love." The  movement can be within a logical class (part for whole, container for  contained), and demands a certain power of abstraction in both  writer and reader, that "abihty to see resemblances" that Aristotle  praised so highly where metaphor is involved. The tropes form a  rather miscellaneous group, notoriously so, standard lists ranging  from eight to thirty or more. Some rhetoricians attempted to classify  them by their general operations, a typical example, found as late  as Alexander Bain in the 1880s,^ being the grouping into "Figures  Founded on Similarity" (simiUtade, metaphor), "Figures Founded  on Contiguity" (metonymy, synecdoche, transferred epithet), and  "Figures Founded on Contrast" (irony, interrogation). It is im- portant to realize that aU such groupings place the tropes in va- rious classes but without implying fundamental differences be- tween them: "contiguity," as in the Ad Herennium's description of  metonymy, is a variant form of "similarity," not a polar opposite  to it. What Jakobson does is to take the binary oppositions that he  ^'H. Caplan, trans., Loeb Classical Library (London, 1954).  ^English Composition and Rhetoric, enlarged ed., 2 vols.

Even within his  own terms, "combination" is hardly a polar opposite to "selection,"  just a different process, and to see "syntagm" and "paradigm" as  opposites involves taking a metaphor very hterally, spatiahzing it  ("pole" or "axis"), and then subordinating it to a dichotomy.  In the first kind of aphasia, he argues, with "impaired substita- tion and intact contextare," operations of contiguity are said to re- place those based on similarity:  From the two polar figures of speech, metaphor and metonymy, the  latter, based on contiguity, is widely employed by aphasics whose se- lective capacities have been affected. Fork is substituted for knife, table  for lamp, smoke for pipe, eat for toaster . Such metonymies may be  characterized as projections from the Une of a habitual context into the  line of substitution and selection . (p. 69).  I shall retarn to this metaphor of "polar figures of speech," but  must say first that Jakobson is using the term "contiguity" in a  loose, indeed metaphorical way, to describe how aphasics, unable  to recall the proper word, substitate the next best, or the nearest  word they can think of. But in rhetoric, as we have seen, metonymy  involves the substitation of a "related" term (where propinquis does  not mean Uterally "next to") according to fixed transitions or trop- ings within a category on different levels, such as putting the con- tainer for the thing contained, or the sign for the thing signified. In  Jakobson's examples there is no such movement across the levels  within a category, only the attempt to find a substitate correspond- ing to the unrecallable word, some of which are very approximate  indeed. "Table" and "lamp" are two domestic objects sometimes  found in physical contiguity but which do not imply each other,  neither do "eat" and "toaster." It takes a reader with a special  knowledge of the cUnical context to recognize what the aphasic  means by these terms. One may doubt whether they are figures of  speech in the sense that we normally give that phrase. In fact,  when he describes the other type of patient, one "confined to the  substitation set (once contextare is deficient)" Jakobson himself  substantially qualifies his claim that these are rhetorical processes.  Such an aphasic  deals with simUarities, and his approximate identifications are of a  metaphoric nature, contrary to the metonymie ones familiar to the op- </page> <page sequence="13"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 33  posite [sic] type of aphasics. Spyglass for microscope, or fire for gaslight  are typical examples of such quasi-metaphoric expressions, . since, in  contradistinction to rhetoric or poetic metaphors, they present no de- Uberate transfer of meaning (p. 72).  In that case, they are not reaUy metaphors, and since the items in  the first class are not really metonymies Jakobson's use of rhetori- cal terms can be seen to be both opportanistic and vague. Just as  with the attempt to apply rhetorical terms to music or paintmg,  the translatio of rhetoric to linguistics, and thence to psychology  and neurology, involves both a simpUfication and a distortion of  rhetoric.  Yet Jakobson was unconcerned by such reflections, retarning  to his earher metaphor m a chapter entifled "The Metaphoric and  Metonymie Poles." Here he asserts that either of those two rela- tions, similarity and contiguity, can appear "on any verbal level—  morphenuc, lexical, syntactic, and phraseological" (p. 77). That  may well be, especially given the rather vague terms in which they  are defined, but where his argument becomes really damaging is  when he asserts that "either of the two gravitational poles [gravity  provides a further reinforcing metaphorj may prevaU," that is,  what he caUs "metaphor" will dominate over "metonymy," or vice- versa, not just in the disordered mental world of aphasics but in  Uterary genres or large-scale artistic movements. Jakobson actaally  proposes (pp. 77-8, 81-2) the foUowing dichotomy, based on the  "dominance" of either "pole:"  Metaphor Metonymy  Russian lyrical songs Russian heroic epics  Romanticism and symboUsm ReaUsm  SurreaUsm Cubism  Poetry Prose  He argues that "the predominance of metonymy" underUes real- ism, which belongs to "an intermediary stage between the decUne  of romanticism"—he must mean in the mid-nineteenth centary—  "and is opposed to them both." This case is argued in two sen- tences, in terms of "the reahstic author metonymically" digressing  from the plot to atmosphere, or from characters to action, and U- lustrated with two quotations from Tolstoy (p. 78). One hardly  knows which to admire most, the vastaess of the thesis or the pau- city of argument. Perhaps further analysis would only have com- pUcated the issue. The same mixtare of grandiose assertion and  </page> <page sequence="14"> 34 R H E T O R I C A  non-existent argument characterizes his dichotomizing of poetry  and prose: "Since poetry is focused upon sign, and pragmatical  prose primarUy upon referent"—let us not stop to discuss that  proposition—"tropes and figures were stadied primarUy as poeti- cal devices. The principle of similarUy underlies poetry. . . . Prose,  on the contrary, is forwarded essentiaUy by contiguity" (pp. 81-2).  This reveals too clearly Jakobson's ignorance of rhetoric, in which  tropes and figures were studied primarUy as expressive devices,  first in prose and only later in poetry. But the distinction is so vast  as to be meaningless.  In Jakobson's work, as in Vico and White, rhetoric is frag- mented and then subordinated to an alien enterprise. This is a pat- tern we have met before, in medieval rhetoric, with its disintegra- tion of a unified tradition into components that were reused for  different and usually more restricted ends." In Jakobson the guid- ing spirit is the binary opposition basic to structaralist phonology  after Trubetzkoy, which here not only divides rhetoric into two  terms, and two only, but then conceives of them in fundamental  opposition. Invoking what he claims to be "the bipolar structure of  language (or other semiotic systems), and in aphasia, the fixation on  one of these poles to the exclusion of the other" (pp. 78-9; my ital- ics), Jakobson states as a general law that: "A competition between  both devices, metonymie and metaphoric, is manifest in any sym- bolic process, either intrapersonal or social" (p. 80). The reader  may feel at this point that such an opposition, and the further de- sire to exclude one half of the field, is manifest most of all in Jakob- son's thought-processes. In other words, aphasia provides the  norm for wide-scale social and intellectaal movements. His sup- porting evidence is what he calls the "decisive question" in analyz- ing the structure of dreams, namely whether the symbols and nar- ratives that occur there are based on contiguity (Freud's metonymie  "displacement" and synecdochic "condensation") or on simUarity  (Freud's "identification and symbolism") (p. 81). Freud provided  Hayden White's quaternary scheme with four terms: the same text  accommodates Jakobson's binary theory with two. These categories  are malleable, evidently, and once again too vast to be usable. Jakob- son's other evidence is the wholly outmoded anthropology of J. G.  Frazer, who, as Jakobson innocently puts it, "resolved" the prin- 3 See Vickers, In Defence of Rhdoric, ch. 4, "Medieval Fragmentation."  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 35  ciples underlying magic rites into simUarity and contiguity—"this  bi-partition is mdeed Uluminating," he says (p. 81).  Jakobson was a great bnguist, whose contribution will stand  when most of us writing in this centary will have long been forgot- ten. But on this issue he is merely expressing a general attitade to  rhetoric in modern times, which first reduces its scope, and then  applies it to purposes that it never dreamt of. No rhetorician before  Vico could have thought of describing the evolution of human con- sciousness in terms of the interaction of four tropes, or summing  up the complex natare of poetry and prose in two.  The effects of Jakobson's dichotomizing reduction of rhetoric  have, I beUeve, been disastrous, as a whole critical school has  attempted to read literatare solely in terms of metaphor versus  metonymy, ignoring aU other verbal devices. (Not to mention the  glaringly obvious fact that many metaphors are metonymie: the  distinction does not even apply on its own terms.) The kind of un- discipUned and unhistorical criticism that may use this method as a  form of self-legitimization is iUustrated from an unexpected side in  a recent work by Gordon WUliams which appears to be about  rhetoric in Latin poetry.^" In fact the author claims that between the  major compositions of CataUus and the death of Horace (60-8 B.C.)  poets used a technique of composition that "ran counter to rhetori- cal theory as it has come down to us (mostly from later periods),"  in particular by denying "the fundamental distinction between  form and content" basic to rhetoric with its categories of inventio  and elocutio (p. ix). But unfortanately rhetorial theory was already  fully formed in this period, as an examination of the Rhetorica ad  Herennium, De Inventione, and what we know of their Hellenistic  sources, wUl soon show; indeed rhetoric was already a part of  Roman education then, and its impact is clearly visible in the po- etry of CataUus, and Horace; whUe the distinction between res and  verba is inherent in the Latin language and in general thought cate- gories.^ "Once that comfortable distinction between form and con- '"Figures of Thought in Roman Poetry (New Haven, Conn., 1980).  ^See, for example, M.

But this is to confuse creation with criticism, shice it does not con- sider how poets constructed their poems, and to substitate an ani- mus against rhetoric for an informed and responsible attitade to  history. WUliams claims that the poetry of this period is "a poetry  of meditation," not "a rhetorical poetry" which would try to "ma- nipulate an audience by making immediate impact," a process that,  according to him, only arose later, during the age of Augustas,  when "rhetorical theory" succeeded in forcing its "unpertment im- positions" (the animus is becoming clearer) on to poetry, assimUat- ing it "to the condition of prose (with the addition of metre). . . . It  is only fairly recently that the impostare has been seriously ques- tioned" (pp. x-xi)—namely by Professor WUUams himself, in two  previous books.  Whether "a poetry of meditation" is the right description for  the poetry of CataUus, or Horace, is a question that can be left to  other readers, but what this dichotomy—privUeging one side and  dismissing the other—reveals is just another instance of classicists'  continuing hostihty to rhetoric. Williams's case is interesting in that  he admits to having been "faced with difficult problems of termi- nology," since he scorns to use that of the "ancient rhetorical theo- rists." Apparently, they "confined their analysis to simple struc- tares for the most part, like rhetorical questions or aposiopesis,  and devoted their attention otherwise to figures of speech"—but  since these are aU figures of speech, that is a mearungless state- ment. Worse stUl, the "close distinctions" they made between  terms (unlike WiUiams), can easUy get the modern user into "a  scholastic nightmare of labelUng in which the important issues  simply disappear from view" (pp. xi-xii)—another travesty of clas- sical rhetoric. Therefore he decided to use Jakobson's simpler bi- nary opposition, even though he knows that  ancient theorists used the words 'metaphor' and 'metonym/ to de- scribe modifications of meaning that are produced by the fact that a  sign or group of signs is connected to an unexpected or unusual refer- ent. The resulting modification is inteUigible to the reader because a  relationship of simUarity or of contiguity Unks the normal or expected  referent with the new referent,  which presupposes in the reader the capacity to recognize the rela- tionship (p. xi). This is, despite the general dismissal of rhetoric, an  acute observation on the actaal functioning of these tropes as con- </page> <page sequence="17"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 37  ceived of in the classical treatises, weU supported by his later sur- vey of the relevant texts (pp. 23ff.). Yet although the author knows  how unhistorical and non-rhetorical Jakobson's terminology is, he  finds it converuent for the real aim of his book, which is equally  non-rhetorical. By "figures of thought" in his title he refers not to  the figurae mentis of the handbooks (which in any case meant those  expressing "the mind, feeling or conceptions": QuintUian 9.1.17),  but to a special technique which he claims operated in Roman po- etry of this period. For these poets, it seems, "an idea . . . could be  regarded as a semantic unit, analogous to a word, and could be  subject to configurations with other ideas just as had been done pre- viously with words [thus sabotaging his chronology again!]. Conse- quently . . . new techniques could be devised for managing transi- tions of thought, and the poet could say one thing whUe expecting  his reader to understand that he meant something else. . . ." (pp. ix- x). That seems to me, I confess, a whoUy unfounded idea, and one  that opens the door to any interpretation of a text, whatever its  overt meaning, putting the critic in a state of privUeged communi- cation with the manes of his poets, since he alone, after nearly two  thousand years, knows what then poems are really about. The  prospect is alarming, but in the event it tarns out to be a largely  conventional piece of criticism, using such concepts as "thematic  anticipation" and "objective correlative." Yet it dismissed rhetoric;  and sought legitimization by using Jakobson's two "polar" tropes.  Some dangers of this reductive attitade to rhetoric have been  brought out by Gerard Genette, a critic who has devoted much  thought to rhetoric and its history and who has edited two classic  French rhetoric texts.^' Commenting on the appearance in 1970  of the Rhdorique generale of the "Groupe p. de Liege" (a team of  Belgian critics who adopted the first letter of "metaphor" for then  name), and of two articles discussing "la figure generalisee" and  ^Genette's three volumes entitled Figures include a number of essays on rheto- ric. Figures I (Paris, 1966) has an interesting study of Etienne Binet's 1621 rhetoric- book (pp. 170-83), and an essay called "Figures" (pp. 205-21) that unfortunately re- gards figures solely as "deviations" from normal speech rather than expressive de- vices in their own right. Figures II (Paris, 1969) has an excellent essay on "Rhetorique  et enseignement" (pp. 23-42), while Figures III (Paris, 1972) includes the text I shall  discuss, "La rhetorique restreinte" (pp. 21-40), also available in English as "Rheto- ric Restrained" in Genette, Figures of Literary Discourse, trans. A. Sheridan (Oxford,  1982), pp. 103-26. (Instead of "restrained" I would translate "reduced" or "re- stricted.") My quotations are from the last-named essay, in the original.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 38 R H E T O R I C A  "la metaphore generalisee," Genette observed that in aU these cases  rhetoric was being neither generalized nor enlarged, but reduced,  restricted. Aristotle's Rhdoric was a truly general treatise, includ- ing some remarks on metaphor, but now the term "generalized" is  applied to what is in effect a handbook of figures (pp. 21-2). Rheto- ric has always had a smaller role m modern times, of course, com- pared to its statas in Greece and Rome, but Genette thinks that the  final process of reducing it to a stady of tropes began with the pub- lication in 1730 of the treatise Des Tropes by Du Marsais, the gram- mar expert for the Encyclopedic, whose interest in rhetoric was that  of "a Unguist, and more precisely a semantician" (p. 23). Du Mar- sais was concemed with the process by which tropes offered a sub- stitation of a "figurative" sense for "the proper" sense, a concern  that was taken further by Fontanier when he reedited Du Marsais'  treatise in the 1820s, and made the trope the model for all other  figures, as if by right. Although including eighteen tropes, in a  somewhat chaotic order, Du Marsais had proposed that they should  be arranged hierarchically, a suggestion, Genette points out, al- ready made by Vossius in the seventeenth centary (probably Vico's  unacknowledged source), who defined four main genera: meta- phor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony (pp. 23-4). Du Marsais  proposed an aUgnment based on the three main associative prin- ciples of simihtade, contiguity, and opposition. (Genette does not  note that these principles are already clearly defined in the classical  rhetoric texts.) Fontanier rejected irony, and stated that the oiUy  tropes worthy of the name were metonymy, synecdoche, and meta- phor. As Genette puts it, one has orUy to combine the two ap- proaches to obtain "le couple figural exemplaire, chiens de faience  irremplagables de notre propre rhetorique moderne: Metaphore et  Metonymie" (p. 25): china dogs, or "bookends" as the English ver- sion has it.  The final reduction of all tropes to these two was carried out,  as we have seen, by Jakobson (anticipated, apparently, by EUchen- baum in 1923, who also made the correlation metonymy=prose,  metaphor=poetry), but Jakobson's borrowing from rhetoric u\- volved, as Genette shows, a drastic reduction of the scope of these  figures. In classical rhetoric the categories of analogy and con- tiguity refer to signifiers placed m a substitational relation within  metaphor and metonymy, such as "gold" and "corn" (having u\  common the color yellow), "steel" and "sword" (exchanging sub- stance for artifact). Jakobson assimUated that opposition to one  </page> <page sequence="19"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 39  derived from linguistics, between paradigm and syntagm, equiva- lence and succession, but these oppositions refer to what is sig- nified, not to the signifiers. As well as creating an opposition  where none exists in the original, and then displacing it within the  linguistic sign (from signifier to signified), Jakobson's "drastic re- duction" of scope continues what Genette sees as a general trend  in modern rhetoric, one that prefers tropes of a more semantically  concrete, "spatio-temporal" natare, excluding those that rely on in- tellectaal operation. This "displacement of the object . . . privi- leges the two relations of contiguity (and/or inclusion) and resem- blance, whUe weakening those of association" (pp. 25-6). The  trope synecdoche depends on similarities being grasped by the intel- lect, and cannot be subsumed under physical contiguity: "sail" for  "ship," as Genette points out, is a substitation not by contiguity—  which would demand "mast," say—but within a class defined  logically (p. 27). Perhaps for this reason it was of no use to Jakobson  Ui his attempt to define aphasia in "purely linguistic terms." The  "pseudo-spatial" concept of contiguity, as Genette calls it, may  privUege metonymy but it also creates a further reduction within  the figure itself, for many of the relations described by classical  rhetoric—effect for cause, sign for the thing signified—"cannot be  easUy reduced to an effect of contact or spatial proximity, unless by  using metaphor" (pp. 27-8). Contiguity in this physical sense can- not relate "heart" and "courage," "bowels" and "pity," so that "to  reduce aU metonymy to a purely spatial relationship is to restrict  the mode of action of this figure to a single physical" or material  aspect (p. 28). As with my analysis of the attempt to apply figures  of rhetoric to music,^' the field of appUcation of the rhetorical de- vice taken over into another discipline is immediately Umited.  The same reductive process has operated with the figures of  resemblance, benefiting metaphor at the expense of others, espe- cially comparison or simiUtade. Genette's detaUed and original  analysis of the functioning of analogy—which reveals, too, the ui- adequacy of a Jakobsonian binary model (pp. 29-31)—shows that  metaphor is only one of several figures of analogy, and that to re- duce aU such tropes to "the metaphoric pole" is to do violence to  language and to thought. The opposition metonymy-metaphor, he  ^'See Vickers, "Figures of Music/Figures of Rhetoric?" op. cit. in note 1, pp. 1- 44, and the literature cited there.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 40 R H E T O R I C A  concludes somewhat mockingly, could be assimUated to other  grand binary schemes, such as the correspondence between heaven  and earth, or between the sisters in the Gospel: metonymy is  Martha, the active one, busy about the house, passmg from one  object to another, duster in hand, while metaphor is Mary, who  havmg chosen "the better part," namely contemplation, wiU go  straight to heaven. Or they could be seen as horizontal versus ver- tical, or materialists (prosaic people privileging "contact") versus  spiritaalists (poetic souls preferring "simUitade"), or—but "nous  ne pousserons pas plus loin," he comments with a rare sarcasm,  "ce jeu d'extrapolations manicheistes, dont les stations temunales  ne reservent aucune surprise" (pp. 37-8). Genette's target in these  closing pages is the elevation, more marked in French literary the- ory than elsewhere, of metaphor to "the trope of tropes," the fig- ure of figures, the only part of rhetoric worth saving (pp. 28-40). I  agree with him that this is the ultimate reduction of rhetoric, the  penultimate stage being Jakobson's binary opposition, its apotheo- sis a monism that, from the vast corpus of the art, privUeges one  single trope, a rare survivor from "the great shipwreck of rhetoric"  in the runeteenth centary (p. 32).  My last example of the reduction, fragmentation, and misap- plication of rhetoric in modern literary discourse is the work of the  late Paul de Man, in three collections of essays. Blindness and In- sight. Essays in the Rhdoric of Contemporary Criticism (New York,  1971) contained work produced between 1966 and 1969. Allegories of  Reading. Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust  (New Haven, 1979) brought together essays from 1972 to 1976,  whUe The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York, 1984) assembled es- says written between 1956 and 1983. This last volume discusses  Wordsworth's Essays upon Epitaphs in terms of the figure prosopo- poeia—traditionaUy, of course, a figure which represents an imagi- nary or absent person as speaking or acting, or attributes life and  human quahties to dumb or inanimate objects—but which is here  idiosyncraticaUy claimed to be "the trope of autobiography," since  it "deals with the giving and taking away of faces, with face and  deface, figure, figuration, and disfiguration" (pp. 75-6)—a self- centred playing with the word (the figure polyptoton) that de Man  sometimes indulged in. Another essay, "Anthropomorphism and  Trope in the Lyric," claims that in Baudelaire's "Correspondances"  the "anthropomorphic" symbohsm of seeing natare as a "temple"  of trees with living "pUIars"—surely referring to architectare and  </page> <page sequence="21"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 41  therefore not primarUy anthropomorphic—means that "anthropo- morphism" can be elevated to the ranks of rhetoric as a "figure of  amplification" (pp. 246-7). Both essays are typical of de Man in  limUing their interest in rhetoric to one stage, elocutio, then to one  category within it, namely a specific trope (sometimes misnamed  figure), which then becomes the fragile basis for a vastly elaborated  theory. But at least this rather misceUaneous volume does not at- tempt to tarn rhetoric against itself, as the two other coUections do.  Blindness and Insight uses "rhetoric" in the subtitle, but the  term only appears in an essay caUed "The Rhetoric of Blindness,"  which finds Jacques Derrida guUty of "blindness" in his reading of  Rousseau. The rhetoric text in dispute is Rousseau's Essai sur I'ori- gine des langues^ (c. 1756), especially the discussion of how imita- tion works differently in the various arts. Readers of my account of  the translation of rhetorical categories to the visual arts^' wUl recog- ruze the tradition behind Rousseau's giving the priority to draw- ing—"le dessin"—over color. Much of Rousseau's thirUcing on lan- guage derives from famUiar emphases in the rhetorical tradition:  language distinguishes men from beasts (p. 27); gestares express  emotion vividly, and history has many examples of "ces manieres  d'argumenter aux yeux" which prove that "on parle aux yeux bien  mieux qu'aux oreilles: U n'y a personne qui ne sente la verite du  jugement d'Horace a cet egard" (pp. 31-3). The passage in Horace  that Rousseau alludes to is the inescapable tag ut pictura poesis, and  his account of the emotional impact of metaphor—"les discours  les plus eloquens sont ceux oti I'on enchasse le plus d'images"  (p. 35)—derives from a long and well-known tradition of the power  of visual appeal, recently flourishing in France (Rousseau cites  Lamy's L'Art de parler). The origin of language, Rousseau reasons,  was due not to the satisfaction of human needs—gestares are more  appropriate for that—but to the expression of feeUng. The original  languages resembled poetry, not geometry, man's first words being  formed to express immediate emotional needs: "pour emouvoir un  jeune coeur, pour repousser un aggresseur injuste la natare dicte  des accens, des cris, des plaintes: voUa les plus anciens mots in- ventes" (pp. 41-3).  ^Quotations are from J.-J.

Chapter III of his treatise is entifled  "Que le premier langage dut etre figure," and at once links rhetoric  and feeling:  Comme les premiers motifs qui firent parler I'homme furent des pas- sions, ses premieres expressions furent des Tropes. Le langage figure  fut le premiere a naitre, le sens propre fut trouve le dernier.  D'abord on ne parla qu'en poesie; on ne s'avisa de raisoner que long- tems apres. (p. 45)  Anticipating the reader's objection that an expression cannot be- come figurative before its literal sense has been established—a se- rious objection, still—Rousseau replies that  pour m'entendre il faut substituer I'idee que la passion nous presente,  au mot que nous transposons; car on ne transpose les mots que parce  qu'on transpose aussi les idees, autrement le langage figure ne signi- fieroit rien.  In a trope res and verba must cohere in the process of translatio (the  Latin term for metaphor) from one level of discourse to another.  The motive force in Rousseau's theory of the trope's translatio is  "passion," strong feelings such as fear. His example is of a savage  who encounters other men for the first time and in his fear sees  them as bigger and stronger than himself, and so calls them "gi- ants"; later, as he gets used to them, he substitates the term "men."  The example may not be weU chosen, as de Man complains, but my  point is that Rousseau uses it to connect tropes with feeling: "VoUa  comment le mot figure naif avant le mot propre, lorsque la passion  nous fascine les yeux. . . . L'image Ulusoire offerte par la passion se  montrant la premiere, le langage qui lui repondoit fut aussi le pre- mier invente" (p. 47).  Of Rousseau's theory as such I have little to say beyond notuig  the organic connection it preserves between rhetoric and feeling.  But I find it strange that de Man's discussion of Rousseau, and Der- rida, should totally ignore the affective significance of tropes. In  his view, the title of Rousseau's chapter III "must be understood"  as saying, "the only Uteral statement that says what it means to say  is the assertion that there can be no literal statements" (Blindness,  p. 33). Rousseau's chronology—first trope, then literal meaning—  is collapsed into a simultaneity that produces an impasse of contra- </page> <page sequence="23"> The Atrophy of Modem Rhetoric 43  diction. De Man wishes to argue that aU Uterary language, and so  Uteratare itself, is figurative, and therefore ambivalent, but he  foists this theory into Rousseau's text, which is given the additional  quaUty of undermirung itself: "Accounting for the 'rhetoricity' of  its own mode, the text also postalates the necessity of its own mis- readmg." That is, it writes in "an indirect, figural way that knows it  wiU be misunderstood by being taken literaUy" (p. 136). But if this  reader, any reader, can distinguish literal and figurative, why is  misreading a necessity? Because, de Man might reply, reading is  impossible. Rousseau supposedly makes metaphor "the corner- stone of a theory of rhetoric"—I cannot discover that Rousseau had  a theory of rhetoric: this text merely argues that communication of  feeling results in the invention of figurative language—but "a  rhetoric that can assert itself only in a manner that leaves open the  possibihty of nusunderstanding." It not only "leaves open" that  possibUity, but "opens up," much more excitingly, "the possibUity  of the archetypal error: the recurrent confusion of sign and sub- stance" (ibid.). So, de Man concludes, any text can be called "Uter- ary" that "implicitly or explicitly signifies its own rhetorical mode  and prefigures its own misunderstanding as the correlative of its  rhetorical natare; that is, of its 'rhetoricity'" (ibid.). Derrida ac- cused Rousseau of blindness, but, de Man says, he either read  Rousseau in terms of Rousseau's critics or else he deliberately mis- read him (p. 139). Either way, he is himself blind—or rather, he  shows "blindness to be the necessary correlative of the rhetorical  structare of literary language" (p. 141).  Paid de Man's discussion of Rousseau's rhetoric is typical of his  whole critical method, being based on a very small amount of text,  which is here interpreted in a way quite different to that meant, in- deed insisted on by the author. Rousseau's emphasis on tropes  as representing passion, feeUngs, poetry as against rational dis- course—a web of ideas derived from the rhetorical tradition, most  immediately from VicoTM—is ignored in favor of a modern inteUec- *See Vico (note 15), passages quoted in the text above; also Bk. 2, §2, ch. 4,  "CoroUaries Concerning the Origins of Languages and Letters," para. 431, which  argues that "the first men of the gentile world . . . expressed themselves by means  of gestures or physical objects which had natural relations with the ideas" (p. 139);  and ch. 5, para. 456, "Corollaries Concerning the Origins of Poetic Style," which  argues that "poetic language" was "bom entirely of poverty of language and need  of expression. This is proved by the first lights of poetic style, which are vivid repre- sentations, images, similes, comparisons, metaphors . ." (p. 153).  </page> <page sequence="24"> 44 R H E T O R I C A  tuaUst discussion of metaphor in terms of literal and figurative lev- els. This line of discussion is then subjected to a mode of sunulta- neous assertion and negation which results in a logical impasse:  "rhetoricity" is found to be the state of making assertions that are  fated to be misunderstood. In Allegories of Reading this process is  repeated on a larger scale, both as a general theoretical statement  and as a reading of Nietzsche. In the opening chapter, "Semiology  and Rhetoric," de Man explains that he uses the word rhetoric to  signify "the stady of tropes and of figures," and "not in the derived  sense of comment or of eloquence or persuasion" (p. 6; my italics).  But this is a hypallage, that gets things back to front: tropes and fig- ures are the verbal means by which persuasion is carried out, not  an alternative to it, to be detached for separate discussion. And  persuasion is not a "derived" but a primary conception of rhetoric.  In the hands of de Man rhetoric no longer means oratory, civic elo- quence, moving the feelings, or constructing the whole of an artis- tic discourse; it refers to a few well-known tropes, not even figures.  The modern fragmentation of rhetoric is carried further, reducing  it from persuasion or "actaal action upon others" to the workings  of a self-contained "intralinguistic figtue or trope" (p. 8). It is made  introverted, solipsistic.  Whether de Man ever read Aristotle, Quintihan, or any other  rhetorician remains unclear (Derrida, by contrast, cites Aristotle in  Greek). His actaal kowledge of rhetoric as revealed in these essays  is limited to a fundamentally misguided conception of the art, and  to a few tropes, not always correctly understood. But this did not  prevent him from making grand generalizations. The contimUty  between grammar and rhetoric, a constant in the language arts  for over two thousand years, is swept away in three pages (9-11).  On the basis of an anecdote attributed to an American TV charac- ter, Archie Bunker, who responds to his wife's enquiry whether he  wants his bowling shoes laced over or under with the irritable reply  "What's the difference?", de Man buUds up a whole theory of a  "tension between grammar and rhetoric." Since the question is ca- pable of being misunderstood (either asking "what is the difference  between x and y?", or implying "it makes no difference to me"—  his wife duly misunderstands, taking it in the first sense, and giv- ing an unwanted explanation) de Man concludes that "the same  grammatical pattern engenders two meanings that are mutaaUy ex- clusive: the literal meaning asks for the concept (difference) whose  existence is denied by the figurative meaning" (p. 9). This trivial  </page> <page sequence="25"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 45  incident, describing a banal misunderstanding, actaally gives de  Man the cue to define the "difference between grammar and rheto- ric," namely that "grammar allows us to ask the question, but the  sentence by means of which we ask it may deny the very possibUity  of asking." Unfortanately, de Man has misunderstood the term  "rhetorical question," which means a question posed without the  expectation of a reply, the speaker implying the answer to be self- evident. De Man, however, says that a question "becomes rhetori- c a l . . . when it is impossible to decide by grammatical or other lin- guistic devices which of the two meanings [literal or figurative]  prevaUs." (This would simply be a muddled or ambivalent ques- tion.) But, insisting on his idiosyncratic and anachronistic late  twentieth-centary conception, de Man takes it to a melodramatic  and paranoiac conclusion, with the rhetorical question now seen as  a "semiological enigma," recording the despair that a speaker feels  "when confronted with a structare of linguistic meaning that he  cannot control," a state that can only lead to "an infinity of sirrular  futare confusions" (p. 10). So de Man reaches the amazing conclu- sion that in the rhetorical question, as such: "Rhetoric radicaUy  suspends logic and opens up vertiginous possibiUties of referential  aberration." And he promptly equates this "rhetorical, figural po- tentiaUty of language" with Uteratare, simUarly bound to an auto- telic absorption with itself, not with the world or experience it pur- ports to describe, and equally liable to self-undermining. After a  brief analysis of a passage in Proust, made to deny "the intrinsic  metaphysical superiority of metaphor over metonymy"—a point- less enough exercise in the Jakobsonian mode of setting one trope  off against another—de Man concludes by reaffirming that "a liter- ary text simultaneously asserts and denies the authority of its own  rhetorical mode" (p. 17).  In deconstructionist theory, we may say, the binary opposi- tions of structaralism, originally conceived in spatial or skeletal  terms, are confronted in a linear equation, and made to negate  each other. An older modern critical school, the so-called "New  Criticism," with its concepts of "tension" and "hony," has also  contributed to this critical mode.^' But the oppositions, polarities,  deconstructions, vertigo, are in the mind and method of the critics.

They may be expressing modern anxieties  about language, with the curiously self-satisfymg claim that lan- guage is an unreUable tool, but they ought not to foist these anxi- eties on to rhetoric.  De Man's essays on Nietzsche, especially "Rhetoric of Tropes"  (pp. 103-18), and "Rhetoric of Persuasion" (pp. 119-31), further ex- tend the deconstructionist deformation of rhetoric. As with the  Rousseau essay, some references to rhetoric by Nietzsche (mamly  the notes he took for the course on rhetoric given to an audience of  two stadents at Basle University duruig the winter semester 1872- 73), form the starting-point of de Man's enquiry, an enquiry that  wiU end, like the Rousseau piece, in an unpasse. Nietzsche made  excerpts from several recent German books on rhetoric, Richard  Volkmann's stUl unequaUed survey. Die Rhetorik der Griechen und  Romer in systematischer Uebersicht (1872), Gustav Gerber's Die Sprache  als Kunst (1872), and the twin stadies by Friedrich Blass, Die grie- chische Beredsamkeit (1865) and Die attisclie Beredsamkeit (1868). As a  classical philologist anxious to estabUsh his career, Nietzsche was  diligent in taking notes, but added his own comments and inter- pretations, stUl not pubbshed in their totaUty.^^ He had exceUent  authorities, and produced a well-balanced account of the art. The  course as a whole discussed: 1. the concept of rhetoric; 2. the main  divisions; 3. the relationship between rhetoric and language; 4. elo- cutio: linguistic purity, clarity, decorum; 5. decorum of character  and ornament; 6. neologism; 7. tropes; 8. figures; 9. prose rhythm;  10. the doctrine of stasis; 11. genera et figurae causarum; 12. judicial  rhetoric and its types; 13. deliberative rhetoric; 14. epideictic rheto- ric; 15. dispositio; 16. memoria and actio; Appendix: a brief history of  eloquence.

To  pick out some of the main emphases, Nietzsche begins with the  prestige of rhetoric in the ancient world, as the final stage in the  formation of cultare and intellect. He shows his awareness of  the recent history of rhetoric, noting its decline in the nineteenth  centary, and quoting the attacks by Locke and Kant (p. 104). To U- lustrate the great statas of the orator in Rome he cites Schopen- hauer's account of the power of eloquence to penetrate the lis- tener's mind and feelings, leading them wherever he wUl, even  against their desires (p. 105)—Cicero and QuintUian made new,  once again. In the present time, he writes, "rhetorical" has come to  mean "artificial" in a pejorative sense, but of course, he asserts,  "nataral" is itself a relative concept, and in fact rhetoric is only a  development of artifices already present in language. Invoking Aris- totle's description of rhetoric as a force (dynamis), Nietzsche argues  (like Rousseau) that the purpose of language is not to pass on ab- stract truths or instruction, but to communicate an individual's  emotions and judgements (p. 111). Drawing very closely on Gerber's  work, Nietzsche equates rhetoric and language, since aU words  originated as tropes, and continue to be fundamentally trope-Uke  (pp. 112-3; p. 128 n. 38). This idea also resembles Rousseau, but we  note that Rousseau's linking of tropes and the feelings has disap- peared from the nineteenth-centary rhetorical tradition. Retarning  to the relation between art and natare, Nietzsche makes the tradi- tional points that the orator must avoid any impression of artifice,  must imitate natare, and win the audience's belief in his smcerity  (pp. 117-8). The "agonistic," competitive natare of rhetoric in the  ancient world, he writes (perhaps echoing his friend Jacob Burck- hardt), meant that the weapons with which orators fought had to  be not orUy powerful but beautiful, so that eloquence was meant to  be both ethicaUy movmg and aesthetically pleasing, arousing the  audience's admiratio, which Cicero and QuintiUan—both quoted by  Nietzsche—held to be an essential result of oratory.  Whether Nietzsche got his knowledge of rhetoric direct from  the classical sources or from modern surveys (the latter seems the  case for his somewhat confusing account of the tropes: p. 129 n. 67)  is irrelevant. Once the full texts become available (including his lec- tare notes on Aristotle's Rhetoric), we should be able to confirm an  interim judgment that Nietzsche was fully aware of the whole so- </page> <page sequence="28"> 48 R H E T O R I C A  cial and pohtical function of classical rhetoric. Us powers of persua- sion, its use of movere, its various genres and categories, and its  detaUed teaching on the tropes and figures. Yet in Paul de Man's  account, Nietzsche's interest in rhetoric seems oddly one-sided. De  Man makes two major claims. Fust, that "Nietzsche moves the  stady of rhetoric away from techniques of eloquence and persua- sion (Beredsamkeit) by making these dependent on a previous the- ory of figures of speech or [sic!] tropes" (Allegories of Reading, p. 105;  my italics). Secondly, that for Nietzsche "the figurative structare is  not one linguistic mode among others but it characterizes language  as such" (ibid.). The passages cited to substantiate both pouits de- rive from the same section in Nietzsche's notes, §7, on tropes, itself  largely derivative from Gerber. De Man claims that the second  point "marks a full reversal" of estabhshed priorities, from a con- ception of language "in its adequation to an extra-linguistic refer- ent or meaning" to one directed to "the intrahnguistic resources of  figures" (p. 106).  Even from the very brief account I have given of Nietzsche's  notes on rhetoric, it is clear that the first point is quite without sub- stance. Nietzsche has no program to move the stady of rhetoric  away from eloquence and persuasion. Nor does he make persua- sion "dependent on a previous theory" of the tropes: this is de  Man's own formulation, stated earUer in his book (p. 6), and in fact  Nietzsche fails to make an exphcit connection between the tropes  and persuasion. As for the second point, de Man represents Nietz- sche's opinions more accurately, but the deduction that a beUef  in the figurality of language means a shift from an extralinguistic  to an intralinguistic concept of rhetoric is not Nietzsche's but de  Man's, already made in his opening essay, in propria persona (p. 8).  It should now be evident that de Man is ascribing to Nietzsche atti- tades towards rhetoric that he himself holds. De Man's account is  highly selective, once more, again using small points from his au- thor to support his own much larger claims. A fragment in The Will  to Power (1888) on chronological reversal, the fluctaating priorities  of cause and effect, inside and outside, is set beside the account of  metonymy or metalepsis in the rhetoric notes (1872) to claim that  both texts give language "the possibUity of substitating binary po- larities such as before for after, . . . cause for effect, without regard  for the truth-value of these structares" (pp. 107-9). By running to- gether two texts working at radically different levels and in quite  different contexts, de Man is able to diagnose what he caUs "the  general drift of Nietzsche's thought," no less, namely "the possibU- </page> <page sequence="29"> The Atrophy of Modem Rhetoric 49  ity of escaping from the pitfalls of rhetoric by becoming aware of  the rhetoricity of language" (p. 110). That seems, however, his prob- lem, not Nietzsche's. The underlying deconstructionist's preoccu- pation appears unmistakably in de Man's judgment of Nietzsche's  essay "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense," that "although  U presents itself legitimately as a demystification of Uterary rheto- ric," it "remains entirely Uterary, rhetorical, and deceptive itseU"  (p. 113). Once again, the desired impasse is achieved, with an air of  satisfaction at having reached the quod erat demonstrandum.  In de Man's mental universe rhetoric is fated to a condition of  deceit and mystification from which it is ceaselessly but fruitlessly  trying to escape. Literatare, and indeed language, suffer simUar  fates, so that, rather like Plato's arraignment of rhetoric with trag- edy and music, the defender of rhetoric once again finds himself in  congenial company. Yet why should rhetoric be ascribed this self- disruptive, fruitlessly un-self-healing fate? That is a hard question  to answer, but the other essay on Nietzsche, "Rhetoric of Persua- sion" (given de Man's rejection of persuasion this is perhaps meant  as a deUberate oxymoron or self-contradiction) pushes this dia- gnosis to its extreme point. De Man starts with a long passage from  the posthumous fragments known as The Will to Power which chal- lenges that basic tenet of philosophy since Aristotle, the principle  of non-contradiction, the impossibUity of affirming and denying  the same thing (pp. 119-21). Readers must judge for themselves the  cogency of Nietzsche's argument on this head, and de Man's ac- count of it (as he says, "the text does not simultaneously affirm and  deny identity but it derues affirmation:" p. 124)—I want to pick up  the discussion later, where de Man surprisingly bends his account  of The Will to Power, sections 477 to 479, which is said to effect the  deconstruction of consciousness and of thought as act (p. 129),  back to his earher discussion of Nietzsche's rhetoric.  De Man now claims that the Course on Rhetoric "starts out  from a pragmatic distinction between rhetoric as a system of tropes  and rhetoric as having to do with the skiUs of persuasion" (p. 136).  Anyone who takes the trouble to consult the text wUl see that it  does nothing of the kind, as my summary above has shown. To  understand de Man's reading of Nietzsche we must read him as he  said we should read Derrida or Rousseau, namely substitating the  critic's name for the author's. So, he goes on,  Nietzsche (de Man] contemptuously dismisses the popular meaning  of rhetoric as eloquence and concentrates instead on the complex and  philosophicaUy chaUenging epistemology of the tropes. . Privileg- </page> <page sequence="30"> 50 R H E T O R I C A  ing figure over persuasion is a typicaUy post-Romantic [de Man] ges- ture. . . (p. 130)  The references to history and specific texts begin to take on a hallu- cinatory or purely imaginary quality, as in the comments that in  Plato "rhetoric becomes the ground for the furthest-reaching dia- lectical speculations conceivable to the mind" (a grandiose affirma- tion with litfle content or meaning), whereas in the "text books that  have undergone Uttle change [sic.'] from QuintUUan [sic.'j to the  present," rhetoric "is the humble and not-quite-respectable hand- maiden of the fraudulent grammar used in oratory; Nietzsche him- self begins his course by pointing out this discrepancy and docu- menting it with examples taken from Plato and elsewhere" (ibid.).  Nietzsche did not in fact begin his course lU&lt;:e that, but that is how  de Man began his book—or at least placed an essay first which  called grammar in question.  The degree of assinulation of Nietzsche to his own views on  rhetoric, language, and literatare reaches its height in the last page  of de Man's essay, where he ascribes to Nietzsche the "final in- sight" that "what is called 'rhetoric' is precisely the gap" that de  Man has just posited between the "phUosophical" and "pedagogi- cal" traditions, represented by Plato (!) and QuuitUian:  Considered as persuasion, rhetoric is performative but when consid- ered as a system of tropes, it deconstructs its own performance.  Rhetoric is a text in that it aUows for two incompatible, mutuaUy seU- destructive points of view, and therefore puts an insurmountable ob- stacle in the way of any reading or understanding. The aporia be- tween performance and constative language is merely a version of the  aporia between trope and persuasion that both generates and para- lyzes rhetoric and thus gives it the appearance of a history (p. 131).  That is perhaps the most extraordinary statement about rhetoric  made in its long history. Yet it is entirely typical of de Man's de- constructiorust methods in the way it fractares rhetoric into per- suasion on the one hand, tropes on the other, dismisses the first  without discussion, finds an inherent flaw in the second, and then  juxtaposes them as "incompatible, mutaaUy self-destructive"—  one of those activities being superfluous (a dehberate pleonasmus7).  This is as if to say that verbs and nouns were always fighting  against each other, or themselves, thus making commurucation im- possible. In Paul de Man's theory of Uteratare rhetoric becomes  grist to the deconstructionist mUl, which "both generates and para- lyzes" not just rhetoric but literary criticism, discourse itself.  </page> <page sequence="31"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 51  De Man's influence on contemporary criticism, especiaUy in  America, has been great, and it may well be beneficial. But as re- gards rhetoric, his effect can only be harmful, for the totaUy un- historical and self-confusing natare of his raids on rhetoric could  paralyze and staltify any further thought.^ The concern that any re- sponsible stadent of rhetoric must feel over this idiosyncratic distor- tion has been expressed by at least one reviewer of Allegories of Read- ing, Jeffrey Barnouw.^ Analyzing de Man's account of Proust, which  ' 'It is a sign of the times that the Folger Shakespeare Library should currently  justify a course on rhetoric by reference to "the recent revival of interest in rhetoric  following the work of Paul de Man." The nature and effect of his influence can be  seen from an issue of New Literary History (vol. 9, no. 3, Spring 1978) devoted to  "Rhetorical Analyses" (a more than usually abused term here), which includes an  essay by Jonathan Culler, "On Trope and Persuasion" (pp. 607-18). Culler parrots  de Man (unacknowledged) in claiiiung that "the relationship between trope and  persuasion is always problematic and discontinuous," and that "rhetoric is fated" to  an "incalculable textuality (p. 608), a hesitation or "aporia" between "structure  and event" (p. 609) that makes rhetoric itself an "irony" (p. 611), the "aporia of trope  and persuasion" leading Culler to a further vision of "rhetoric as language cut loose  from a ground" (p. 615). This tradition has already reached a cul-de-sac: what next?  In a matching essay, with the ambitious title 'Rhetorical Analysis: Towards a Tro- pology of Reading" (pp. 619-25), Marie-Rose Logan acknowledges her debt to de  Man, which is so total and uncritical that she hasn't even bothered to read Nietzsche  for herself, repeating as gospel truth de Man's claim that: "At the beginning of his  course on rhetoric Nietzsche" makes a "pragmatic distinction between rhetoric as a  system of tropes" and rhetoric as eloquence, dismissing "the latter in favor of the  former . . . because he intends to concentrate on the philosophic epistemology of  tropes" (p. 620). But as I have shown, this is de Man's rejection, not Nietzsche's.  The reverence for audoritas, which is another parallel between the medieval and  modem fragmentations of knowledge, a talismanic worship of "modern masters,"  is seen in the way Logan links Nietzsche with Derrida and de Man, and then claims  that their "deconstruction" of rhetoric—"(understood as the study of tropes and  figures)" she adds parenthetically—has been carried further by linguistics and for- malism: "for, indeed, such critics as Jakobson, Todorov, Barthes, Genette, Greimas,  and Riffaterre have all contributed . . to the elaboration of a refined theory of rheto- ric which could be termed a sophisticated epistemology of rhetoric" (ibid.). I have itali- cized the terms meant to valorize the "enterprise" supposedly carried out by this  heterogeneous group of worthies, since the root metaphors connote on the one  hand the purif)dng process of alchemy and on the other the degeneration of a sub- stance from its original and integral state: a suitably muddled metaphor for this  topsy-turvy argument.  ^'In Comparative Literature Studies 19 (1982), pp. 459-63, page-references incor- porated into the text.

Its affinities  with the 'self-consuming artifact' of Stanley Fish include the capacity  to create difficulties in and for a text. The difficulties in either case are  not real, however, but simply needed for the therapeutic effects of  reading, (p. 461)  "Therapeutic" for the deconstructionist implies reading a text so as  to reach what de Man calls a "state of suspended ignorance" (Alle- gories, p. 19), the sceptic's aporia or doubt, what I have called the  impasse.  Quoting de Man's conclusion to his Nietzsche chapters, with  its discovery (or creation) of what we might call structaral aporiai  within rhetoric, Barnouw comments that de Man's claim to reach  this conclusion "by means of reading and presumably understand- ing what Nietzsche wrote is just the sort of 'paradox' that de Man  would see as in some way confirming his approach" (p. 462). But  Barnouw re-examines the long excerpt from The Will to Power  which de Man quotes and shows that his account of it is seriously  misleading. In it Nietzsche argues that the principle of identity "re- flects not an objective impossibUity and necessity but a subjective  inabiUty," the subject's "need to reduce things to a manageable  order," to "posit and arrange a world that should be true for us."  He is referring to logic, not language, arguing that "our sense of  reality, our awareness of entities, precedes and underlies logic," so  that it is a basic error to "make of logic a criterion of true being"  (p. 462). De Man, however, applies Nietzsche's point to a much  larger and tendentious argument about "types of utterance" and  the fundamental schism that he finds within rhetoric, as within lan- guage itself. The way de Man applies to language what in fact refers  to logic is an example of what I mean by saying that he "bends"  Nietzsche's thought to his own concerns. As Barnouw shows,  having foUowed out de Man's development of his reading, "the  paradoxical deconstructive discourse is not Nietzsche's, it is read in  by de Man against the intrinsic duection of the text" (p. 463). In the  end we are left with a critical methodology "in which a theory of  </page> <page sequence="33"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 53  reading effectively undermines the capacity to read" (ibid.). In such  a method, we can now see, it was inevitable that rhetoric should  have to be split in two and made to attack itself. De Man may have  thought of himself as a friend to rhetoric, but his use of it for his  own purposes is more destructive than many of its enemies' ex- phcit attacks.  It is worth attacking this deconstruction of rhetoric, even at the  risk of being caUed antipathetic to "modern literary theory," since a  rather important issue is at stake, namely the natare of human  communication. De Man aims to deny language any power to refer  to events or objects or experience outside itself. All tropes, then,  can be faulted in so far as they claim to refer to an outside world  that exists independent of language. So, he baldly asserts,  metaphor is error because it beUeves or feigns to believe in its own  referential meaning. . . . Metaphor overlooks the fictional, textual ele- ment in the nature of the entity it connotes. It assumes a world in  which intra- and extra-textual events can be distinguished.  This is an error, although it can be said that no language would be  possible without this error. To the extent that all language is con- ceptual, it always already speaks about language and not about  things. (Allegories, pp. 151-2)  In his final sentence de Man disintegrates the linguistic sign, which  Saussure formulated (in terms that actaally go back to classical lin- gmstics) as "signified over signifier," that is, drawing a clear dis- tinction between the word (signifier) and the thing or concept (sig- lufied) that it denotes. In Saussure's terminology the two parts of  the sign are divided by a line (as used in the representation of frac- tions) in order to emphasize that they exist on different planes, but  nevertheless form a unity. Whereas hnguistic materialists coUapse  the distinction, tarrung words into things, deconstructionists throw  away half of it, creating a mental world in which signifiers "float  freely," or are "liberated" from the burden of meaning.  We can understand deconstruction historically, as a phase in  twentieth-centary thought reflecting a loss of confidence by some  highly mtelligent, highly educated people about the natare of lan- guage, or as another reaction against positivism, a further caUing  in question of received certainties. Such questioning can be exhila- rating, and salutary but in this case I feel it to be an inward-turning,  self-disruptive process, which derues literatare a "mimetic" rela- tionship with the world just as it denies language a referential  aspect. Of course, many literary texts contain an element of com- </page> <page sequence="34"> 54 R H E T O R I C A  mentary on, or at least awareness of their own statas as works fash- ioned by one human being accorduig to certain artistic conventions  for other humans to read and, presumably, enjoy—that is, to have  their lives enriched by a greater awareness of the possibUities of  Uteratare, and language. But to declare such an element of self- awareness or self-commentary to be the primary function of Utera- tare, and to deny it any abiUty to represent human behavior, is to  start from a dualism (represent the world/represent itself) and tarn  it into a monism that is peculiarly debilitating, since it condemns  literatare to a self-reflexive concern with its own inabihty to repre- sent, or with the incapacity of language to do so. As Jeffrey Bamouw  has said:  If a 'text' can only quaUfy itself as 'literature' by deconstmctively turn- ing on itself, the eventual result wiU be an impoverishment of what  Uterature can say to us, because we no longer bring to it questions  about our world. Awareness of the metaphorical and reflexive charac- ter of language in use, and particularly in Uterature, should rather  lead us to recognize and explore the way language gives us access to  the world at the same time that it informs the world.'^  Deconstruction is a challenge to modern critical theory in that  it caUs in question the whole of our thinking about language, and  literatare, since the earliest records of the Greeks. The challenge  has come from a highly ingenious and articulate sector of modern  phUosophy, which seems to have lost touch with ordinary reality.  We need to remind ourselves, perhaps, of some emphases in mod- ern linguistics that offer an alternative view of language. R. H.  Robins, in his brief but penetrating history of grammatical theory,^  objected to the Stoics' distinction between signified and signifier  because, if taken Uterally, "it leads to the unhelpful conception of  'the meaning' as something actaally existing" as an isolatable en- tity which can be evaluated in purely logical terms (p. 26). But the  "completeness" or otherwise of an utterance, he asserts, "depends  on its fulfilling the purpose intended by speaker or writer in its  context of sitaation and can only be tested in relation to that con- text" (pp. 28-9). One weakness of Greek and Roman grammar  "Barnouw, reviewing the Rousseau chapters in de Man's Allegories of Reading,  in The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography, n.s.6 (1980), pp. 338-9.  *R. H. Robins, Ancient and Medieval Grammatical Theory in Europe with Particular  Reference to Modern Linguistic Doctrine (London, 1951); page references included in  the text.  </page> <page sequence="35"> The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric 55  was that "language was considered too much as the expression of  thought complete in itself, and its dependence on context, the world  around, for its functioning was largely ignored" (p. 44). Later, medi- eval speculative grammarians made grammar the handmaid of phi- losophy. "Language was for them"—as it is, I interject, for the de- constructionists, albeit with different implications—"the verbal  expression of the thought of the intellect. This extraordinarily nar- row and distorted conception of language," Robins writes, has per- sisted into our time, hindering the development of linguistics. To  understand language fully, we must see it "in its proper light as  part of human co-operation, part of social action, in all the every- day sitaations in which men and women find themselves" (p. 89).  We must sitaate language in the world, in concrete human sitaa- tions, for "it is contextaal function alone that constitates and guar- antees linguistic meaning" (p. 92).  The distinction to be made is between language as an instru- ment for human commurucation in a social context, and language  as an end in itself. Deconstructionists deny the former, assert the  latter position. Yet they confuse means with ends, movement to- wards a goal—a dynamic, transactional activity—with the enjoy- ment of having reached that goal, a static condition of weU-being.  Language is movement, relation between individuals and the world  they Uve in, not a self-contained enterprise. To apply a modern  phUosopher's account of the Aristotelian notions of actaality and  frUfUment, movement and employment are always directed to- wards a goal:  AU skilful employments do indeed, in so far as they are skUls, carry an  aspect of intrinsic value, of self-enjoyment; they are all achievements.  But first and foremost they are instmmental; and instruments are just  those things and actions which are not self-justifying.'^   Deconstructionists, living in social contexts, using language ac- cording to social codes, interacting with the world around them,  nevertheless deny language any reUable function in reporting or  creating that world, and grant literatare even less relation to real- ity. This does seem a major paradox, especially since deconstruc- tionist theory flourishes on its own gestares of denial and restric- tion. They deny the instrumentality of language, but assert the  '^Marjorie Grene, A Portrait of Aristotle (Chicago, 1963), p. 217.  </page> <page sequence="36"> 56 R H E T O R I C A  efficacy of their own denial. In that sense they are parasitic on lan- guage, and ultimately destructive of it.  My concern is to defend rhetoric, and a proper defense of lan- guage in its referential mode and its social context can be left to  linguistics, phenomenology, and some of the social sciences. I  would doubt whether the isolation and introversion of language  created by deconstructionism would survive an honest confronta- tion with their work, but that is a task that must be left to other  hands.'^  The sitaation that this paper has attempted to describe must  give grounds for concern to anyone working with rhetoric. The  prestige of Jakobson and de Man is now so great, especially in  America, and growing in Europe, that the objections of a mere his- torian of rhetoric are liable to be dismissed as antiquarian. Even U  this paper were to reach every graduate stadent and budding pro- fessor launching his or her re-interpretation of de Man's interpreta- tion of rhetoric on the world, it would have little effect. What, to be  candid, does the name of Brian Vickers mean, set in the scales  against Paul de Man?—Now that is a true rhetorical question! But  one must nonetheless state one's disagreement, and one's some- what despairing awareness that the true face of rhetoric risks be- coming distorted beyond all recognition. To end with a real ques- tion: What, then, should be done?  "For a defense of the referential nature of language see, to begin with, R. H.
