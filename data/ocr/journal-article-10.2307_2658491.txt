<plain_text><page sequence="1">Presidential Address: "I Have Scinde": Flogging a Dead (White Male Orientalist) Horse WENDY DONIGER LET ME BEGIN WITH A STORY about General Sir Charles James Fox Napier, who was born in 1782 and in 1839 was made commander of Sind (or Scinde, as it was often spelled at that time, or Sindh), an area at the western tip of the Northwest quadrant of South Asia, directly above the Rann of Kutch and Gujurat; in 1947 it became part of Pakistan. In 1843, Napier maneuvered to provoke a resistance that he then crushed and used as a pretext to conquer the territory for the British Empire. The British press described this military operation at the time as "infamous" (the Whig Morning Chronicle, cited by Napier 1990, 197), a decade later as "harsh and barbarous" and a "tragedy," while the Indian press (the Bombay Times, "without a shred of evidence") accused Napier of perpetrating a mass rape of the women of Hyderabad (Napier 1990, xvi). The successful Annexation of Sind made Napier's name "a household word in England. He received ?70,000 as his share of the spoils" (Mehra 1985, 496-97) and was knighted. In 1851 he quarrelled with James Ramsey, the Marquess of Dalhousie (governor general of India from 1847 to 1856), and left India. In 1844, the following item appeared in a British publication in London, under the title, "Foreign Affairs": It is a common idea that the most laconic military despatch ever issued was that sent by Caesar to the Horse-Guards at Rome, containing the three memorable words, 'Veni, vidi, vici' '"I came, I saw, I conquered,"), and, perhaps, until our own day, no Wendy Doniger is the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions in the Divinity School, the Department of South Asian Languages and Literatures, and the Committee on Social Thought, at the University of Chicago.

I am indebted to Susanne Hoeber Rudolph and Lloyd Rudolph for starting me off on the track of Sir Charles Napier; to Katherine Ulrich for finding the Punch text and Blanco, and so much more; to Anand A.

The despatch of Sir Charles Napier, after the capture of Scinde, to Lord Ellenborough, both for brevity and truth, is, however, far beyond it. The despatch consisted of one emphatic word- 'Pecccavi,' 'I have Scinde,' (sinne). The joke here depends upon the translation of the Latin word peccavi, which is the first person singular of the past tense, active voice, of the verb pecco, peccare, "to sin," from which are derived our English words "impeccable" (someone who never sins) and "peccadillo" (a small sin). Thus the double meaning is "I have Scinde" (that is, "I have gained possession of a place called Scinde") and "I have sinned" (that is, "I have committed a moral error"). The story caught on. In a play published in 1852, a character named Sir Peter Prolix recites, at a dinner party, the following doggerel: What exclaim'd the gallant Napier, Proudly flourishing his rapier, To the army and the navy, When he conquered Scinde?-"Peccavi!" (Daniel 1852, 51) And when Napier died, a year later, G. Lloyd wrote to the journal Notes and Queries, "It is also stated, I do not know on what authority, that the old and lamented warrior, Sir Charles Napier, wrote on the conquest of Scinde, 'Peccavi."'1 The incident continued to be cited; a 1990 biography of Sir Charles actually entitled I Have Sind cites it three times (Napier 1990, xv, 160, 197). Stephen Jay Gould cites it: "Sir Charles Napier subdued the Indian province of Sind and announced his triumph, via telegram, to his superiors in London, with the minimal but fully adequate quote, 'Peccavi"' (Gould 1991, 269). According to the latest edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica online, "[Napierl is said to have sent a dispatch consisting of one word, 'Peccavi' (Latin: 'I have sinned'-i.e., 'I have Sindh')." But all evidence indicates that Sir Charles Napier never dispatched such a message. The passage about Caesar and Napier is not from the Times of London but from the comic journal Punch (1844, 6:209), whose editors evidently made it up; the Britannica actually hedged ("he is said to have sent"), and a 1952 biography came right out with it, referring to Napier as "the man who, though Punch was responsible, yet was supposed to have made the pun 'Peccavi'-I have Scinde" (Lawrence 1952, x). Salman Rushdie retold the story in Shame, referring to his "looking-glass" Pakistan as "Peccavistan," but he calls the story apocryphal, bilingual, and fictional (Rushdie 1983, 88). The authors of the Punch item may have been inspired by another apocryphal historical anecdote, which was linked with the peccavi story as early as 1875 and was in circulation for some time before that; it tells us that someone who had witnessed the defeat of the Spanish Armada announced it with one word: "Cantharides," which is the Latin and pharmaceutical name of the aphrodisiac drug known as "the Spanish fly" (Rowley 1875, 166-67). So it is not Napier's text; but it is a text, a British text, that has a history of its own; it is a kind of nineteenth century urban legend, a myth. The fact that Napier never said it does not particularly trouble me, for I am not a historian but a mythologist. But the shift from the text of history 'Notes and Queries no. 212, 19 November 1853, p. 491. In Notes and Queries no. 215 (10 December 1853, p. 574), Cuthbert Bede attributes the Napier anecdote to Mr. Punch, and "A Subscriber" refers to the author of Democritus (that is, to George Daniel).</page><page sequence="3">942 WENDY DONIGER to the hypertext of journalism is significant: the idea of the sin was initially a writer's idea, not a general's. (Rushdie, too, referred to the one-word message as "guilty" [Rushdie 1983, 881.) With this in mind, let us unpack the myth a bit more. Besides the two meanings I've mentioned ("I have conquered India" and "I have committed a moral error"), there is a third, which we discover if we heed the good advice of Marshall McLuhan, who taught us that the medium is the message; for the medium in this case is Latin. That third message signifies something like, "Let's say it in Latin, which we Oxbridge types, English upper classes, know, and the natives do not, though they know English-which we taught them." Stephen Jay Gould, who takes the anecdote as history, remarks: In an age when all gentlemen studied Latin, and could scarcely rise in government service without a boost from the old boys of similar background in appropriate public schools, Napier never doubted that his superiors ... would properly translate his message and pun: I have sinned. (Gould 1991, 269) Latin here functions as a code which the bearers of the message will not understand, a function that James C. Scott has taught us to recognize as the hidden transcript, which those in power can employ in ways different from the ways devised by the disempowered (Scott 1991). The peccavi text is explicitly an imitation of another Latin text (veni, vidi, vici), but that earlier text was unambiguous, spoken in the speaker's native language; unlike Napier, Caesar did not have to translate ("conquered" into ViCi).2 It is also worth noting that even Punch, which invented the story, glossed it in English, realizing that some of their readers might not have been educated in good schools and therefore might not know Latin. But when Priscilla Hayter Napier told the story (as history, not myth) she remarked, "Possibly this was when he sent his celebrated message-'Peccavi,' which, in the Latin every educated man had then at his command, means 'I have sinned"' (Napier 1990, 160). In fact, the pun is not merely bilingual but trilingual or even quadrilingual, for the Latin peccavi carries within it not only the English "sinned" but the proper name "Sind," a Hindi word derived, like "Hindi" itself, as well as "Hindu" and "India," from terms that the Persians derived from the Sanskrit "Sindhu" ("river"). Peccavi also breaks down into two puns in English, turning on the meanings not only of Sind tHindil /sin [Englishi /Sindhu [Sanskrit and Persian) but on the almost invisible word "have," which functions both as a complete verb meaning "possess," as one can possess a thing (like India, to take a case at random), and as an auxiliary verb in the perfect tense indicating that the action represented by the main verb (in this case, "sin") took place in the past, and not in the present. The grammatical fact in this case denies the argument-which will become central to the anti-Orientalist critique-that the subject of the verb goes on doing it. But it is the second meaning of peccavi, the second hidden transcript, of "sin" as a moral error committed (only) in the past, that is of central interest to me. That a man of great political power might have intended this subtext is suggested by a remark by President William Jefferson Clinton that Newsweek (21 September 1998, 27) chose to reproduce as an enormous headline: "I have sinned." (I have since learned from several South Asianist colleagues that they, like me, thought at that moment of 2The remark was quoted first in Latin by Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars ("The Deified Julius," 1.37) and soon after that in Greek by Plutarch in Roman Apophthegms (Moralia, 206 E) and Life of Caesar (731 F). Note the complexity of cross-translation even here.</page><page sequence="4">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 943 Sir Charles Napier.) Though Sir Charles apparently never said (or wrote) peccavi, he seems to have had a sense that he had sinned in Sind. When he was posted there, he wrote: "We have no right to seize Sind, yet we shall do so and a very advantageous piece of rascality it will be" (Mehra 1985, 497). "Rascality" is a rather flip way to refer to the murder of many people defending their own land, but afterwards he wrote, speaking of his ambition, "I have conquered Scinde but I have not yet conquered myself' (Napier 1857, 4.38) and, "I strive to curb pride and vanity. Get thee behind me Satan! But it is not easy to make Satan obey when one is a conquerer" (2.376). Napier was also capable of equivocating, as when he wrote of the Sind campaign: "I may be wrong, but I cannot see it, and my conscience will not be troubled. I sleep well while trying to do this, and shall sleep sound when it is done" (2.275). This last phrase chillingly foreshadows what Harry Truman said after the bombing of Hiroshima: "I never lost any sleep over my decision" (Lifton and Mitchell 1995, 176). Guilt and Anti-Orientalism The sense of sin is not usually a part of the discussion of the story of Napier in India, but it may indicate a moment when some of the British felt moral ambivalence about their conquest of India. And this possibility may help us to dig our way out of the ambivalence which we who study India have inherited and which threatens to poison scholarship about India in our period, bracketed as it is between ante/i- Orientalism before and postcolonialism after. The question is not whether Napier slept sound, but whether we Americans and Europeans engaged in the study of India can sleep sound. Edward W. Said's book, Orientalism, published in 1978, changed our way of thinking forever. Until then, we had admired the British scholars who had recorded dialects and folklore that otherwise would have been lost to posterity, who had established the study of Sanskrit in Europe and made available throughout India as well as Europe many of the classical texts recorded in that language. We felt indebted to them for our own knowledge and love of India. But the anti-Orientalist critique taught us that those British scholars, too, had sinned, that they had been caught up in the colonial enterprise, sustained it, fueled it, facilitated it. It taught us about the collusion between academic knowledge and political power, arguing that we, too, are implicated in that sin when we carry on the work of those disciplines-that it did not stop, like a Latin perfect tense, in the past. At the heart of the postcolonial enterprise was the argument that scholars, then and now, affect and often harm the people they study. Twentieth-century anthropology had called this ideal into question long before Said challenged that of Orientalism; even Rudyard Kipling, in his novel Kim written in 1901, had made his chief spy, Colonel Creighton, an amateur ethnographer. In a passage that I read as a satire on anthropology as spying, Creighton says, "As an ethnologist, the thing's very interesting to me. . . . The transformation of a regimental badge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is very interesting" (Kipling 1987, 161; Said 1987, 32). The Great Game, as Kipling calls it (perhaps translating the Sanskrit lila, the game played by God in creating the illusory world), is not just spying but anthropology, another form of the discipline once known as Orientalism, more specifically Indology, the study of India, my game. What resistance we might have had to the accusation that we were implicated in this Great Game was soon weakened, if not entirely demolished, by our growing</page><page sequence="5">944 WENDY DONIGER recognition of the ways in which Hindu fundamentalists today have used, and continue to use, many of the classical Hindu texts that British scholars validated. For the British gave India a mixed blessing when they privileged ancient texts like the Rig Veda and The Laws of Manu and made them available to people who otherwise would not have known them, providing a legitimating power that, like all power, could turn nasty and did turn very nasty indeed when it was used as a weapon against Muslims, women, and liberal Hindus. We who had once studied the Rig Veda with awe in small classes consisting of a mix of passionately devoted ex-hippies and cold, brilliant linguists came to react to the word "Veda" as if someone had said "fascism" (more precisely, "right-wing militant Hinduism"); the word had changed its connotations, just as "adult" had come to mean "pornographic" (as in "adult books and films, adult viewing"). We can no longer think without the postcolonial critique. The Freudian and post- Freudian Marxist agendas tell us to look for the subtext, the hidden transcript, the censored text; the Marxist and to some extent the Freudian assumption is that this subtext is less respectable, more self-serving, but also more honest, more real than the surface text. In India the British surface text-"We are bringing civilization to these savages" -reveals a subtext- "We are using military power to make England wealthy by robbing India." But there are more than two layers to any agenda, and we must not assume that it's self-interest all the way down. The peccavi anecdote suggests that beneath the subtext of self-interest may lie a nobler self-perception, a place where guilt is registered. And perhaps, beneath that, there may be yet another layer, an admiration of India, a desire to learn from India, perhaps even a genuine if misguided desire to give India something in return (like Christianity, for instance, or British law, or railroads). American scholars who study India also have many layers. But the sense of guilt that the excavation of the imperialist subtext has generated has taken a terrible toll on the study of the text itself. Anti-Orientalism has led in many quarters to a disregard for the philology and basic textual work that the Orientalists did very well and that still remains the basis of sound scholarship about India. This need not be so. The original anti-Orientalist agenda was monolithic in ways that soon came to be modified, by Edward Said himself, among others, and by James C. Scott. We have learned to see not just oppressors and victims but oppressors and resisters, subverters, people who knew, and know, how to wield the weapons of the weak. Take, for instance, the anti-Orientalist argument that the British "invented" or "imagined" India or Hinduism. I am, as I said, a mythologist, which is to say I take metaphors literally, for many myths are simply the narrative embodiment, sometimes an exaggerated embodiment, of metaphors, even cliches (Doniger 1998, 3). So I always imagined the British imagining India as meaning that, before the British got there, there was nothing south of the Himalayas but a black hole, of the Calcutta or stellar variety. And then the British came and sat in a circle, holding hands, eyes tightly shut, chanting a mantra ("Rule Britannia"), until, like Athena from the head of Zeus, like a file called forth from a hard disk, India popped up on the map, on the screen of the world, full grown, complete with the word for Hinduism and the Laws of Manu translated by Sir William Jones and the Rig Veda in Max Muller's edition. India, brought to you by the people who brought you the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Hong Kong! This concept always seemed to me profoundly disrespectful of India, which was quite capable of inventing itself and went right on inventing itself for centuries before, during, and after the British presence.3 Granted, they had imagined 3Any talented Indian sage can imagine things like that, as we learn from the Yogavasistha (O'Flaherty 1984).</page><page sequence="6">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 945 themselves, at first, not as citizens of a nation but as people who lived in that place that was different from other places. And, granted, the anti-Orientalists imagined a rather different sort of imagining by the British, one that conceptualized India for the.first time as a unitary political entity, rather than a group of independent entities, and Hinduism as a unified religion, and so forth. And, granted, the British imagination did distort and constrain the ways in which Indians represented themselves to others and, to a lesser extent, to themselves. But British ideology never entirely replaced the ways in which Indians had traditionally regarded themselves, nor did it erase their knowledge of their own history. The anti-Orientalists themselves have taught us how powerful language can be, and "imagining" does have the meaning that I made fun of just now, a meaning that denies agency to the Indian imagination. Edward Said, in a long essay that served first as an introduction to Kim, in 1987, points out the significance of the moment when the "white-bearded Englishman" who is the curator of the museum (a figure modelled on Kipling's father, Lockwood Kipling, a famous veterinarian) gives his own glasses to the Tibetan Lama to see through. (Said does not, however, note the parallel and equally significant gift that the Tibetan gives to the Englishman: an antique box forpens, the gift of texts [Kipling 1987, 601). The metaphor of the gift of glasses can stand not only for the colonizers' distortion of the vision of the colonized but for the distortion of our own vision by any ideology, including those of both Orientalism and anti-Orientalism. Obsessed with the nineteenth century, the postcolonial critique has forced us to look through monolithic, and hence skewed, spectacles that prevent us from seeing anything but our previous spectacles, the ones bequeathed to us by British Orientalism. It is time to stop merely looking at those flawed lenses and to try to see through them, that is, beyond them and also by means of them, this time correcting for the Orientalist astygmatism. It is time to go back to the Orientalists with what the philosopher Paul Ricoeur called a "second naivete": an innocence that has travelled through loss of innocence to an apparently unchanged but actually quite different sort of innocence. There is much in the colonial scholarship on India that is worth keeping; I am unwilling to throw out the baby with the bath-a judgment call that depends on how good you think the baby is. As the irrepressible Lee Siegel put it recently, "Those hegemonic, imperialist, Euro-centric colonialists were such amazing writers and they knew so much more about India than all of us. They could ride horses, too."4 Those horses offer a paradigm for us to use in our struggle to come to terms with the blotted copybook bequeathed to us by British Orientalism. When Gyan Prakash's critics sought a metaphor for the "ambiguity and contradiction" that they saw in his attitude to Orientalism they accused him (as they accused Said) of being an "inconstant rider" who wants to "ride two horses at once," Prakash's two horses being Marxism and poststructuralist deconstruction (O'Hanlon and Washbrook 1992, 167). Prakash rode the equestrian metaphor right back at them, with humor and spirit, in his response, "Can the 'Subaltern' Ride?"5 He wrote: "The use of the image of the rider is worth pursuing because it illustrates what is at issue in the desire for mastery over ambivalence. In nineteenth century India, the British used, among other things, the inability of the Western-educated Indian (the Bengali babu) to ride horses to keep them out of the 4Personal communication from Lee Siegel, 28 October 1996, re Lockwood Kipling's Beast and Man in India (Doniger 1998, 69). 5The title is a satire on Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's ovular article, "Can the Subaltern Speak?"</page><page sequence="7">946 WENDY DONIGER covenanted civil service" (Prakash 1992, 169). Here we might also consider the complementary British tendency to favor the Muslims, who rode horses very well indeed, over the Hindus. But we might also hear an echo of the hoofbeats of the two horses ridden by an Englishman and an Indian Muslim at the end of E. M. Forster's A Passage To India (written in 1924); the Englishman, "holding him [the Muslim] affectionately," says: "Why can't we be friends now? . .. It's what I want. It's what you want." But the horses didn't want it-they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single-file . . . " (Forster 1978, 312) The horses seem to prove-as Kipling said elsewhere-that never the twain shall meet. But Gyan Prakash uses the metaphor of riding two horses to defend both Said and himself and to argue for precisely the sort of balance that I am arguing for here; he concludes, "Let us hang on to two horses, inconstantly." It seems amazing to me that this reasonable argument still needs to be made; it seems to me to be flogging a dead (white male Orientalist) horse. Vedic Horses The horses that appear as metaphors in these discussions of the British in India are the shadows of very real horses that were used by the British and their predecessors throughout Indian history. A painting from the Kishangarh School of Rajasthan, c. 1740 (see Figure 1, p. 947), perhaps painted by the ruler of Kishangarh, represents the stallion Acambha; the horse's independence and minimal harness, and the scale and pigment with which he is depicted-he is much, much larger than the humans who surround him, and he is opaque while they are transparent-all of this makes him appear to be almost supernatural. Indeed, the humans at his head are offering him smoking incense, as if he were a god. But he has a very real history. Most of the peoples who entered India entered on horseback and then continued to import horses into India: the people formerly known as Indo-Europeans (who brought their horses with them),6 the people who became the Moghuls (who imported Arabian horses from Central Asia and Persia, overland and by sea) and the British (who imported thoroughbreds and hunters from England at first, and then Walers from Australia). In the Rig Veda, composed in Northwest India in about 1,000 B.C.E., the horse represented the "Aryas," as they called themselves, against the indigenous inhabitants of India, the dasyus or "slaves," who are associated with the serpent Vritra, a mythology in which (as in the icon of St. George, on horseback, killing the dragon) the horse that conquers the snake represents us against them (O'Flaherty 1986). The political symbolism of the Vedic horse sacrifice is blatant: the consecrated white stallion was "set free" to wander for a year before he was brought back home and killed. During that year, he was guarded by an army that "followed" him and claimed for the king any land on which he grazed. The king's army therefore drove the horse onward and guided him into the lands that the king intended to take over. Thus the ritual that presented itself as a casual equine stroll over the king's lands was in fact an orchestrated 6The long-held assumption that the Aryans invaded India has been qualified and reeval- uated in different ways by Thomas R. Trautmann (1997) and Klaus K. Klostermaier (1994), taking into account contemporary Indian scholarship.</page><page sequence="8">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 947 Figure 1.

(244-1984-18) Anschluss of the lands on a king's border. No wonder the Sanskrit texts insist that a king had to be very powerful indeed before he could undertake a horse sacrifice (O'Flaherty 1986; 1990). Horses move around in search of new grazing land, which they need constantly. Unlike cows, horses pull up the roots of the grass or eat it right down to the ground so that it doesn't grow back, thus quickly destroying grazing land, which may require some years to recover. The horse is constantly in search of Lebensraum, eminent domain. And the ancient Indian horse-owners mimicked this behavior, as they responded to the need to provide grazing for their horses once they had captured them and kept them from their natural free grazing habits. Like early American cowboys, these Indian cowboys (an oxymoron in Hollywood) rode over other peoples' land and took it over for their own herds, in the spirit of "Don't fence me in" (a concept expressed in Vedic texts by the word amhas-from which comes our "anxiety") and "Give me the wide open spaces" (the word prithu, "broad and wide," the name of the first king, the man whose job it was to extend the boundaries of his territory) (O'Flaherty 1976, 321- 48). It is not merely, as is often argued, that the horse made possible conquest in war, through the chariot; the horse came to symbolize conquest in war, through its own natural imperialism. But it is not easy for a stallion to find good grazing land in South Asia, for he is not well adapted to conditions in most of the area. He is uncomfortable in the humid</page><page sequence="9">948 WENDY DONIGER heat of the Indian plains, and during the monsoon rains his hooves soften in the wet soil and pieces break off, resulting in painful, recurring sores. The Deccan Plateau and Central India provide suitable grazing land, but this becomes parched between May and September (Leshnik 1978, 57). Though the Indian soil apparently has enough lime and calcium to support cattle, it is not good soil for horses; contemporary breeders now add calcium, manganese, iron, and salt to the horses' diet. After Independence, Indian breeders found some places suitable for breeding (though I heard Hindu and Parsi stud owners complain that Pakistan got the best grazing land). Today, in the Punjab, Maharashtra, and Karnataka there is some horse-breeding, and Poona, Bombay, and Calcutta are breeding centers for thoroughbred horses. But the difficulties in breeding large horses are perennial. Kathiawar horses are good for long distances in the desert but are slightly built, not big or fast or strong enough for cavalry; the same is largely true of Arabian horses. And if no new stock is imported, the size of imported horses in India diminishes dramatically in just a few years. As one breeder told me, wistfully, "If we had pasturage all year round, our horses would be an inch taller."7 Here we may recall the ideal represented by the horse in the Kishangarh painting, so much taller than any real horse. Marco Polo, in the thirteenth century, noted the sorry state of horses in Malabar: No horses being bred in this country, the king and his three royal brothers expend large sums of money annually in the purchase of them. . . . [I)t is my opinion that the climate of the province is unfavourable to the race of horses, and that from hence arises the difficulty in breeding or preserving them. . . . A mare, although of a large size, and covered by a handsome horse, produces only a small ill-made colt, with distorted legs, and unfit to be trained for riding. (Polo 1908, 356-57; 1938, 174) It is not strictly true that there were "no horses ... bred" in Marco Polo's time. Horses were bred successfully in North India long before the Turkish invasions in the tenth century C.E., and they continued to be bred under the Moghuls. The British established a stud in Bengal, bred some horses in the Punjab in Saranpur, and encouraged breeding in North India; at first they tried to establish a Bengal stud by importing "good thorough-bred English stallions together with a supply of big, bony, halfbred English hunting mares to serve as a breeding-stock," and a small "committee for the improvement of the breed of horses in India" was established in 1801 (Alder 1985, 50-51). But horses continued to be imported in large numbers for several reasons. We have noted the difficulties presented by the land and climate of India. Compounding this is the allegation, by people who may or may not have known what they were talking about, and who may or may not have wanted to slander the Hindus, that Indian kings and their servants simply did not know how to care for horses properly. Marco Polo said that "For food they give them flesh dressed with rice and other prepared meats, the country not producing any grain besides rice"; moreover, "in consequence, as it is supposed, of their not having persons properly qualified to take care of them or to administer the requisite medicines perhaps not three hundred of these [five thousand] remain alive, and thus the necessity is occasioned for replacing them annually" (Polo 1908, 357). Or, in another version of the text, only a hundred remain out of two thousand; "they all die because, they say, they have no grooms to 7Personal communication from Dr. Faroukh Wadia at the Wadi Stud, Pune, January 1996.</page><page sequence="10">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 949 come to them in sickness and know how to give a remedy; nor do they know how to care for them, but they die from bad care and keeping" (Polo 1938, 174). Kipling expresses in Kim his scorn for "native" horse management: "They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and, being natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which Mahbub's animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by the Bombay tram-company" (Kipling 1987, 185). Note here, too, the reference to country-breds, an acknowledged if inferior breed. In addition to the difficulties of breeding, and possible mistakes in feeding, there is a third reason for the failure of horses to thrive in India. Marco Polo suggests that it is no accident that there were no "properly qualified" people to look after horses in India: "The merchants who bring these horses to sell do not allow to go there, nor do they bring there, grooms, because he wishes the horses of these kings to die in numbers soon, on purpose that they may be able to sell their horses as they will; from which they make very great wealth each year" (Polo 1938, 174). South Indians even today speak of the Arab trick of keeping not grooms but farriers out of India, so that the poor horses were simply ridden until their hooves wore down and they died, a kind of "planned military obsolescence [which] added to the popular notion of the horse as an ephemeral, semi-divine creature (and made for steady business at the Arab end)" (Inglis 1985). And this practice had important repercussions upon the history and mythology of the horse in India. After each initial conquest, the rulers constantly replenished their herds of horses with new stallions and mares imported from outside India, and this constant importing of new bloodlines made Indian horses extremely expensive. Ancient Sanskrit and Tamil sources (such as the Arthasastra and Sangam texts) observe that horses had to be imported, probably from Parthia. Ninth- and tenth-century Sanskrit inscriptions tell us the northern route (Biihler 1892). This route is also described in Kipling's Kim, set in Northwest India: through Kabul, Peshawar, Pindi, Kangra, Ambala, Delhi, and Gwalior. Kipling's Russian spies cross over where the Aryans and, later, the Turks entered India, a few hundred miles from the spot in Sind where Napier had fought a half century earlier. But from the earliest recorded period in Indian history there was also a Southern route, by sea from Arabia as well as overland from Central Asia. South Indians, particularly in the vicinity of Madurai, still tell stories about the Pandyan Kings' energetic importation of horses (Inglis 1985), and there is much more information about the lust for horses among later dynasties such as the Nayakas and the Vijayanagara kings. There is ample testimony from both foreign and Indian sources that South Indians imported as many as 14,000 horses a year valued at 2,200,000 dinars of "red gold" (Pusalker 1957, 523), and the sixteenth-century South Indian king of Vijayanagar is reputed to have imported 13,000 horses annually for his own personal use and for his officers (Nagaswamy 1984). During this same period, 10,000 Arabic and Persian horses were imported into Malabar every year (Mookerji 1912, 195).8 In Marco Polo's time, a horse cost 500 saggi of gold, or 100 marks of silver (Polo 1908, 357; 1938, 174). When the Europeans arrived in India in the Moghul period, horses were very expensive animals, the best ones costing up to $10,000 (Digby 1971). Heavy losses at sea are the primary reason for their high cost (Leshnik 1978, 56); since horses cannot throw up, sea-sickness is almost always fatal, and "shipping such fragile and valuable cargo in a pitching East Indiaman on a six-month journey halfway round the world" was a costly and risky venture. British horses also 8Portugese traders like Payez, Nunez, and Diaz wrote extensively about the horse trade.</page><page sequence="11">950 WENDY DONIGER became more scarce, and even more expensive, when so many of them were used in the Napoleonic Wars (Alder 1985, 50-51). Since horses were so expensive, no native, village tradition of horses developed in India as it did among the natives of Ireland or Egypt, where farmers or nomads kept horses. Stall feeding, essential during the dry months, is out of the question for subsistence farmers, and, in any case, the horse is rarely used as a work animal in India. It does not pull the plough, it seldom carries a pack, and except in Sind and the Punjab, it is not ridden much either. The only common use for the horse in India was, formerly, for military purposes, and, nowadays, for pulling carriages (Leshnik 1978, 57). Throughout Indian history, horses have belonged only to people who were not merely economically "other" than the Hindu villagers-aristocrats-but politically and religiously "other." Though these people were often of low (or no) social status in the caste system, they had to have had superior political or economic powers to be able to afford the cost of maintaining horses in India. The horse represented this power; the tax-collector, or the punitive military expedition, rode into the village on horseback. Muslim Horses Since the beginning of the invasions of India by the Turks, who were to become the Moghuls, Muslims have played the role of good-and-evil foreigners in the horse mythologies of India. Hindus as well as Muslims worship at the shrines of Muslim "horse saints" (Crooke 1896, 2.206). A trace of mystery, perhaps also of resentment, but also of glamor, hedges one of the best-known South Indian stories about Muslim/ Arab horses, a story often retold, in Tamil, Telugu, and other Dravidian languages.9 This version is from a South Indian text composed in Sanskrit in the early sixteenth century: Vatavur had spent on the worship of Shiva the money given him by the king to buy horses. Shiva appeared to Vatavur and said, "I will bring excellent horses; go to Madurai." Days passed and no horses arrived. The king emprisoned Vatavur, who prayed to Shiva. Then Shiva, transforming a whole pack of jackals into horses, himself put on the costume of a horse-dealer. Having taken the form of a supreme horseman, he himself chose a horse that was splitting open the earth with his hoof in order to adorn the form of him [i.e., of Shiva] with the snakes [that lived underground], and the dust on Shiva's face was blown away by the hissing of the snakes that he wore in his hair. The king had the horses brought to his palace. He spent the whole day throwing to the horses food such as chickpeas [canakaj. Then the sun set. The horses went back to their jackalhood, gobbled up all the horses of the king, and went to the forests, like lions, their mouths smeared with blood. The grooms reported the various evil deeds of the horses. (Mandalakavi, Pandyakulodaya 7.1-48) Many Hindu myths depict Shiva as the ultimate other, an Untouchable (O'Flaherty 1976, 272-320). It is thus not really surprising to find him depicted here as a Muslim, or at least no more surprising than it is to find the god Dharma, the incarnation of 9This well-known story is told in several versions of Manikkavacakar's biography, in the Tiruvatavurar Purana (a fifteenth-century hagiography) and the Tiruvilaiyatal Puranam; see also Pope 1900, xx-xxvii, and Yocum 1982, 51-52, 62.</page><page sequence="12">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 951 Hindu religious law, incarnate as a dog (an animal that caste Hindus regard as an unclean scavenger) at the end of the great Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata (17.2.26, 17.3.7-23). The statement that these horses eat other horses reveals this as a myth told by people who do not know horses, for such people generally fear the horse's mouth, with its big teeth. This is a dangerous misconception, for, as every horseman and horsewoman knows, though horses can indeed bite, it is the other end of the horse that poses the real danger-the back hooves-and horses are in any case strict vegetarians. The devouring equine mouth is a projection onto the horse of the violence that we inflict upon him in taming him, through the use of the bit, in the mouth. A different sort of Indian horse-story, from North India, tells us that seventy-two riders, including one woman, came from the sea and landed in Kutch, not far from Napier's Sind; these people, called Jakhs, saved the local villagers from the depredations of a demon; the horses were then sent to Delhi, and on the way they fertilized the local mares (Jain 1985, 24); or, according to another variant, the riders themselves blessed childless women, including the Queen, with children (Williams 1958, 83). In some versions, the riders kill not a demon but a human, a tyrant named Punvro (or Punvaro), who had cut off the hands of the architect who had built the city of Patan (or Padhargadh) so that he might not construct anything like it for another prince (Williams 1958, 83; Kramrisch 1964, 55). Even today, villagers in Kutch make statues of the seventy-two horses and offer sweet rice to the horsemen and ask them for boons (Narayan 1999). Most versions of this myth emphasize the skin-color of the invaders; they are "white-skinned foreigners said to have come in the thirteenth century from Anatolia and Syria" (Kramrisch 1964, 55), or "white-skinned, horse-riding foreigners from Central Asia," or Greeks, Romans, Scythians, or White Huns, "tall and of fair complexion, blue or grey-eyed" (Williams 1958, 84-86). According to Stella Kramrisch, they stand for the Turks: Harking back to other, untold memories from Inner Asian horse-herding cultures, these apocalyptic horsemen transmute the fear generated by Muslim invasions into India into a liberating legend in which the evil power does not come from outside but is local, embodied in the tyrant Punvaro. (Kramrisch 1964, 55) Kramrisch sees these invaders as liberating Muslims; but C.R. Williams sees them as people liberated from Muslims, as "Zoroastrians from the northern parts of Iran, who, during the whole of this period, were emigrating to India in search of the religious toleration which Islamic persecutors denied them in their own country" (Williams 1958, 88). Let us table for the moment the question of whether the invaders are liberating Muslims or liberated anti-Muslims, and ask, Who is Punvro? Onto an apparently historical ruler this myth may have grafted the myth of the tyrant who cuts off the hands of artists, calling upon not "untold memories" of Inner Asia but another, historically specific, myth about the British, who treated the weavers in Bengal so cruelly (there is abundant testimony about this [Mukherjee 1974, 300-31) that they were widely believed, apparently on no evidence, to have cut off the weavers' thumbs, or, on the basis of one piece of dubious evidence, to have so persecuted the winders of silk that they cut off their own thumbs in protest (Bolts 1772, 194).10 The legend '0The thumb-cutting story is found in contemporary British accounts from the 1770s,</page><page sequence="13">952 WENDY DONIGER lives on today in a contemporary story about an artisan from Kutch who made a diabolically clever box with a gun inside it, which fired when anyone opened the box; he gave it to Dalhousie (the same Governor General Dalhousie with whom Napier quarrelled), who gave it in turn to his adjutant (that is to say, his subaltern) to open; the adjutant was killed, and Dalhousie had the craftman's hands cut off (Narayan 1999). The myth of the weavers' thumbs may also have grown out of the famous Mahabharata story of Ekalavya, a dark-skinned, low-caste boy whose skill at archery rivalled that of the noble heroes; to maintain their supremacy as archers, their teacher demanded that Ekalavya cut off his right thumb (Mahabharata 1.123). The myth of Punvro, in Kramrisch's gloss, turns this history on its head, as the Muslims save the good citizens of Kutch from the British, an inversion of the sentiment widely expresed in Chennai (Madras) today, that the British, especially the early East India Company, liberated Hindus in South India from Muslim control and played not merely a neutral but a positive role in establishing an even-handed attitude to all religions in its new territory. In discussing this argument, Joanne Waghorne, like Gyan Prakash, invoked the equestrian metaphor, beginning with the title of her article: "Chariots of the God/s: Riding the Line between Hindu and Christian" (Waghorne 1999). But we must also beware of that version of the myth (the "British saving Hindus from Muslims" version), for the same argument was made by Napier, in the continuation of the passage justifying his sound sleep: "My conscience will be light, for I see no wrong in so regulating a set of tyrants who are themselves invaders, and have in sixty years nearly destroyed the country. The people hate them" (Napier 1857, 2.275). Thus, different versions of the equestrian myth cast different actors as the native villain and the invading heroes. This Kutch tradition may or may not know the ancient Vedic myth of the hegemonic horse trampling the native/demonic serpent (O'Flaherty 1992); we have here the anthropomorphic, and quasi-historical, form of the mytheme, horsemen trampling natives. But the Vedic bias is maintained: the invading horsemen are the heroes. The Vedic horsemen are replaced by Muslims or Anatolians, even by Untouchables and Tribal peoples in some variants (Crooke 1896, 2.206; Sontheimer 1984), while the Dasyus, or Vedic Others, are replaced by a demon, a Patan tyrant or, by implication, the British. This plasticity kept the myth alive in widely varying contexts (Doniger 1990, 79-108) which express, in very different ways, the connection between horses and aliens or foreigners. The confusion of the villains and the heroes in the story of Punvaro is no accident; the myth is rife with obfuscation, as well as a kind of inverted subversion, subversion from the top down: it speaks of the assimilation of the values of the conquerors by those who are conquered, expressing, as it were, the snake-eye view of horses, but in a positive light. Certainly it is a myth about, and probably by, invaders that manipulates the native symbolism of horses and snakes in such a way as to make the invaders the heroes, the natives the villains, in a myth that then took root within the folklore of the natives. It's all done with mirrors, which is to say, with myths. when there was fierce rivalry between various factions of the East India Company's servants in Bengal and their supporters in London. The silk-winders' incident, reported by Wilhelm Bolts, a highly disreputable and probably unreliable witness, writing against his rivals in the Com- pany, found its way into Edmund Burke's attacks on Warren Hastings and then into Indian writings in English in the late nineteenth century. The weavers were caught between the rapacity of the Indian agents who served as middlemen and the young Englishmen for whom they worked. But no contemporary Bengali writers, Hindu or Muslim, seem to have mentioned the weavers' alleged mutilation, perhaps because they attached little importance to what hap- pened to weavers, who were low-caste Muslims and Hindus.</page><page sequence="14">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 953 Now that Edward Said has pulled the scales from our postcolonial eyes, we must take account of the people who constructed this myth, who perpetuated it, recorded it, translated it, selected it. The popular legends concerning these events were "first collected on the spot and written down by Major (later Sir Alexander) Burnes in 1826; copied with minor variations by Mrs. Postans (1839) and later writers and finally embodied in the 'standard' account of Kutch (otherwise a generally reliable source) in Volume V of the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency in 1880" (Williams 1958, 83). It should by now be clear, and will soon become clearer, why the British might have wanted to preserve this myth. But we are still hard pressed to explain the acceptance and perdurance in Hindu India of other forms of this equine mythology, such as the myth of the jackal horses, which has been subject to far less British mediation and still expresses a surprisingly positive attitude to the equestrian conquerors of India. British Horses and Kipling's Kim The myth of the liberating invader riding his stallion continued to cast its ole white magic over the British. Sir Charles Napier was crazy about a half-Arabian horse named Blanco, "perfectly white," whom he rode, talked to, and talked about, for sixteen years. Blanco died in the Bay of Biscay while being, perversely, exported from Portugal to England (Napier 1857, 1.164-66, 186, 346, 351, 385; Napier 1990, 58); sparing no expense, Napier had tried to ship the old horse home like a pensioned- off Indian Civil Servant, to spend his final days out at grass-good pasturage at last. The white stallion was immortalized by Kipling in his novel Kim. Napier's code, in the anecdote, was a message sent about a war; the first chapter of Kim introduces a message about a war, coded not in Latin but in horses, validating "the pedigree of the white stallion." Again, it is a triple code, whose first two levels are easy enough to crack. Ostensibly, on the first level, it means that the Muslim horse-trader Mahbub Ali, who is in the service of Creighton, is able to vouch for a valuable horse that the Colonel may buy. The coded message on the second level is that a provocation has occurred that will justify a British attack, an achievement much like Napier's. The third level of signification is more complex. The idea of a pedigree implies that you know the horse when you know its father and mother (or dam and sire); the breeding of horses, of "bloodstock," of thoroughbreds, was at the heart of a theory of the breeding of humans, a theory of race. Kim is even said to have "white blood," an oxymoron. I need not point out the significance of the color of the stallion in a book by Kipling (who coined the phrase, "the white man's burden"). But we might recall that the Vedic stallion of the ancient Hindus, the symbol of expansionist political power, was also white, in contrast with the Dasyus or Dasas, the serpentine natives, who were said to come from "dark wombs" (Rig Veda 2.20.7). British racist ideas, supported by a complex pseudoscientific ideology, rode piggyback on (or, as one would say nowadays, appropriated) already existing Hindu ideas about dark and light skin conceived without the support of a racist theory like that of the British; one might say that the Indians "imagined" color prejudice for themselves before the British imagined it against them. The white stallion also implicitly represents Kim's Irish father, in the metaphor that Creighton and Mahbub Ali apply to Kim, behind his back: Kim is a colt who must be gentled into British harness to play the game (Kipling 1987, 161). On the other hand, to Kim's face Mahbub Ali uses the various breeds of horses as a paradigm for multiculturalism before its time; in response to Kim's</page><page sequence="15">954 WENDY DONIGER question about his own identity (he felt he was a Sahib among Sahibs, but "among the folk of Hind ... What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist?"), Mahbub Ali answers: "This matter of creeds is like horseflesh. ... the Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own country" (Kipling 1987, 191). In recorded British history, too, horse-breeding, spying, and Orientalism combined in the character of William Moorcroft, a famous equine veterinarian. In 1819, the British sent him to Northwest India, as far as Tibet and Afghanistan, on a quixotic search for "suitable cavalry mounts" (Yang 1998, 116). Moorcroft had seen mares from Kutch that he thought might be suitable for the army (Alder 1985, 105), and he was granted official permission "to proceed towards the North Western parts of Asia, for the purpose of there procuring by commercial intercourse, horses to improve the breed within the British Province or for military use" (Alder 1985, 209). But he "collected information not only on military supplies but also on poiitical and economic conditions obtaining at the peripheries of the Empire" (Yang 1998, 116), and shortly before his mysterious final disappearance, in 1824, he was briefly imprisoned in the Hindu Kush on suspicion of being a spy (Alder 1985, 341). Moorcroft had delusions of Orientalism; he told a friend that he would have disguised himself "as a Fakeer" rather than give up his plan (Alder 1985, 209), and after he was lost, presumed dead, in August of 1825, legends circulated about "a certain Englishman named Moorcroft who introduced himself into Lha-Ssa, under the pretence of being a Cashmerian," or who spoke fluent Persian "and dressed and behaved as a Muslim" (Alder 1985, 209, 357-58). The final piece of Orientalism in his life was posthumous: from 1834 to 1841 his papers were edited by Horace Hayman Wilson, secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford (Alder 1985, 367). According to his biographer, Moorcroft was thrilled by the stories he heard "from the north-western horse-traders-swarthy, bearded men like Kipling's Mahbub Ali" (Alder 1985, 107). But Kipling created Mahbub Ali fifty years after the publication of Moorcroft's papers, and aspects of the characters of Creighton, Mahbub Ali, and Kim himself may have been inspired by Moorcroft. In his surprisingly appreciative essay on Kim, Edward Said wrestles with his conflicted feelings about Kipling. On the one hand, Said demonstrates how deeply embedded, indeed coded, in Kim is the racist and imperialist view for which Kipling became notorious. But, on the other hand, Said speaks of Kim as "profoundly embarrassing" (Said 1987, 45)-for Said, and for us, for any readers caught between their warm response to the artistry of the book and their revulsion at the racist terminology and ideology. Said speaks of Kipling as "a great artist blinded in a sense by his own insights about India," who sets out to advance an obfuscating vision of imperial India, but "not only does he not truly succeed in this obfuscation, but his very attempt to use the novel for this purpose reaffirms the quality of his aesthetic integrity." Salman Rushdie, too, has written of his ambivalence toward the good-and- evil Kipling (Rushdie 1991) and, I think, modelled the hero of Midnight's Children on Kim: a boy with English blood who appears to be both Hindu and Muslim. But Rushdie reverses the point about race: the English blood doesn't matter at all, nor the Hindu blood; the boy is a Muslim because he is raised as a Muslim. The ambivalence that Said and Rushdie expressed towards Kipling was matched by that of the poet W. H. Auden, who began the final section of his poem on the death of the poet William Butler Yeats (1940) with these verses: Time that is intolerant of the brave and innocent,</page><page sequence="16">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 955 And indifferent in a week to a beautiful physique, Worships language and forgives Everyone by whom it lives; Pardons cowardice, conceit, Lays its honours at their feet. Time that with this strange excuse Pardons Kipling and his views, And will pardon Paul Claudel, Pardons him for writing well. Auden eventually decided not to pardon Kipling and his views; he excised these verses from subsequent editions, but not before thousands of readers in the English-speaking world had memorized the lines, which are very powerful in precisely the way that, as George Orwell pointed out, Kipling's own verse is powerful. Orwell argued that Kipling is a "good bad poet," who wrote the kind of poetry that you would like to forget but that you remember, almost against your will, more easily, and longer, than good poetry (Orwell 1954, 135). Rushdie, too, concludes his essay by saying, "There will always be plenty in Kipling that I find difficult to forgive; but there is also enough truth in these stories to make them impossible to ignore" (Rushdie 1991, 80; italics added). Nowadays, the French are reviving (if not necessarily pardoning) Paul Claudel, while Anglophones read, and remember, Kipling. And Edward Said used his first official presidential column in the Modern Language Association's newsletter to denounce-bad writing (Smith 1999). Kim is a novel written about, and out of, the British love of India. In part, of course, that love was like the love of another Englishman, Shakespeare's Henry V, for France, as he explains to his French bride: "I love France so well, that I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine" (Shakespeare, Henry V, 5.2.182-83). But that is not the only kind of love there is, even in the hearts of other dead white males who "loved" the civilizations of people with darker skins. The British also loved India for the right reasons, reasons which jump off every page of Kim-the beauty of the land, the richness and intensity of human interactions-and which can still be our right reasons: because the study of India stretches our understanding of what it is to be human and enriches our lives with the products of its imagination, so different from our own. The Gift Horse The symbol of the horse became embedded in the folk traditions of India and then stayed there even after its referent, the horse, had vanished from the scene, even after the foreigners had folded their tents and gone away. To this day, horses are worshipped all over India by people who do not have horses and seldom even see a horse, in places where the horse has never been truly a part of the land. In Orissa, terra cotta horses are given to various gods and goddesses to protect the donor from inauspicious omens, to cure illness, or to guard the village (Huyler 1985, 162). In West Bengal, clay horses are offered to all the village gods, male or female, fierce or benign, though particularly to Dharma Thakur, the sun god. At Kenduli in Birbhum, clay horses are offered on the grave of a Tantric saint named Kangal Kshepa, and Bengali parents offer horses when a child first crawls steadily on its hands and feet</page><page sequence="17">956 WENDY DONIGER like a horse (Bhattacarya 1978, 48-49). In Tamil Nadu, as many as five hundred large clay horses may be prepared in one sanctuary, most of them standing between 15 and 25 feet tall (including a large base), and involving the use of several tons of stone, brick, and either clay, plaster, or cement (Inglis 1980, 298, 302, 304). They are a permanent part of the temple and may be renovated at ten- to twenty-year intervals; the construction of a massive figure usually takes between three to six months. In Balikondala, votive horses, or thakuranis, are provided as vehicles for the gods to ride at night to protect the fields and visit the infirm; and there are terra cotta horses in the Shaivite temple on the edge of the village (Huyler 1985, 105; 1981, 200). New horses are constantly set up, "while the old and broken ones are left to decay and return to the earth of which they were made" (Kramrisch 1964, 57). The horses are said to be ridden by spirit riders who patrol the borders of the villages, a role that may echo both the role of the Vedic horse in pushing back the borders of the king's realm and the horse's association with aliens on the borders of Hindu society. But the villagers do not express any explicit awareness of the association of the horses with foreigners; they think of the horses as their own. A Marxist might view the survival of the mythology of the aristocratic horse as an imposition of the lies of the rulers upon the people, an exploitation of the masses by saddling them with a mythology that never was theirs nor will ever be for their benefit, a foreign mythology that produces a false consciousness, distorting the native conceptual system, compounding the felony of the invasion itself. A Freudian, on the other hand, might see in the native acceptance of this foreign mythology the process of projection or identification by which one overcomes a feeling of anger or resentment or impotence toward another person by assimilating that person into oneself, becoming the other. Though there is much to be said for these interpretations, I would want to augment them by pointing out that myths about oppressive foreigners and their horses sometimes became a positive factor in the lives of those whom they conquered or dominated; and that the horse cult did not supplant but rather supplemented the continuing worship of other, more native animals-such as snakes. The corpus of Hindu myths that depict the Turks and Arabs bringing horses into India seems to have assimilated the historical experience of the importation of horses not only to the lingering vestiges-the cultural hoofprints, as it were-of Vedic horse myths, but also to the more widespead theme of "magical horses brought from heaven or the underworld." The myth is, like the horse, a gift from the sea, or from the sky- from an other world. And like all great symbols, the horse is often susceptible to inversion as well as subversion: the horse of the conquerors becomes the horse of the conquered. This mythology lends the horse, over and above its natural allure, all the glamor and pathos of the interior room as watched by the child outside, pressing her nose against the windowpane. This is an otherness not loathed but admired, not despised but coveted; it is an otherness that has been assimilated into the native system of values. The villagers who recognize that the horse belongs to those who have political power may be worshipping the horse in order to gain some of that power for themselves. But this is not all that is happening. Several parallel power relationships are expressed through the symbolism of the horse in contrast with the serpent, on the one hand, and the rider, on the other. Rider is to horse as horse is to snake: power, and domination, travels down the line. First comes the power structure between humans and horses; then between people of power and people without such power; between foreigners and natives; and, specifically, between British and Muslims, on the one hand, and Muslims and Hindus, on the other. But who is represented by the horse, who by the serpent, and who is the rider?-</page><page sequence="18">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 957 Though the village terra cotta horse may express an implicit wish for the power of those who have horses, its worshippers seem to seek the power of the horse itself: fertility as well as political power. For the horse is, after all, a contradictory symbol of human political power. It is an animal that invades other horses' territory but whose first instinct is always not to attack but to run away. Horses are prey rather than predators, as is evidenced by the fact that they have their eyes toward the back of their heads, the better to flee, rather than in the front, like the cats and other hunters. Like the villagers who worship him, the horse has been oppressed and robbed of his freedom by human beings who made up stories about horses. The fragility of the horse is well represented by the fragile, ephemeral medium in which villagers usually represent him: clay. The horse is thus both victim and victimizer, a ready-made natural/cultural symbol of political inversion. The most basic power beyond manpower, horsepower is what we still use as a touchstone, a basis for measuring other sorts of mechanical power. But horses are not machines; people who work with horses know that you are never in control, that you never entirely tame a horse, who remains at some level always wild. And, finally, the horse is a potent natural symbol of things other than power: fertility, as we have seen, but also beauty, which people continue to care about even when it is clearly not in their best interests to do so. Horses are numinous; they captivate the eye, they inspire desire, they have magic. Their allure infects even people who know, on a rational level, that horses aren't good for them. And this allure is what Indian artistans try to capture in their religious images; it is what makes them treat horses like gods. The Hindu villagers' ability to appreciate the beauty and power of a creature that was the instrument of great political injury to them might inspire us to try once again to appreciate the tarnished but precious gift bequeathed to us by British Orientalists. Sometimes we cannot help looking a gift horse in the mouthpiece, or even in the ideology, but we can still accept the gift. Flawed as they are, the Orientalists are our ancestors, and, as Hamlet wisely cautioned, "Use each man after his own deserts, and who shall 'scape whipping?" (Hamlet 2.2.545). We know that most of the British Orientalists shared Kipling's views, but they are not all alike; some are better than others. Can we pardon them for writing well? The Auden poem (1966, 143) ends with a verse that he did not excise: In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountain start, In the prison of his days, Teach the free man how to praise. Emprisoned as we are, as Said taught us to realize that we are, in the twisted ideologies of the founders of our discipline, we must still find ways not only to praise what they praised, but to praise them, too.
