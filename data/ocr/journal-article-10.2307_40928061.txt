The title of this remarkable new book by Jessica Johnston is at once accurate and misleading: although the book is indeed a case study of the computer antivirus industry, the narrow focus implied by the title belies the significant 1054</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS contributions it makes to a much broader literature. What Johnston provides is not only a detailed analysis of the challenge of computer security as a social, organizational, and technological dilemma, but also an exemplary examination of the social construction of software technology. Historians of computing have been calling for years for more research on the history of software, and Technological Turf Wars represents a major contribution to this as-yet underdeveloped literature. The book begins with a brief history of the computer virus metaphor as it has been employed by the computer industry and suggests that the metaphor is not merely a "picturesque anthropomorphism" that makes comprehensible an otherwise complex and intangible threat. Rather, John- ston suggests, the metaphor reflects and embodies larger concerns about the risks associated with computerization: anxiety about the changing rela- tionship of humans and computers, fears about the vulnerability of com- plex technological systems to malicious technological subversives, and the apparent inability of traditional social structures, including the law, to keep up with rapid and profound changes that computer technology seems to be imposing on the broader society. The antivirus industry - and, more spec- ifically, the small number of computer-security experts and researchers who specialize in antivirus research - mobilizes this sense of perpetual cri- sis in computer security as a means of maintaining their own power and authority. "By shrewdly cultivating insecurities, promoting worst case sce- narios, and adroitly resolving these crisis with new technical insights and product innovations," Johnston argues, the industry maintains and rein- forces a "symbiotic reciprocal cycle" with computer users that ultimately becomes impossible for these users to escape. "Once you get into antivirus you can never get out" (pp. 39-41), as one of Johnston's corporate inform- ants ruefully laments. At the heart of Johnston's analysis is a network of antivirus researchers known as CARO (Computer Antivirus Research Organization). CARO members are an elite group of experts who sit at the intersection of aca- demic, scientific, corporate, and technical networks. Although CARO members freely share information within their network, they carefully con- trol access to this information by others - including, in many cases, their corporate employers. In doing so, they cultivate and maintain a "knowledge monopoly" that allows individual CARO experts an enormous degree of personal authority and prestige. By limiting access to extremely time-sensi- tive data on new strains of computer viruses, CARO can effectively disci- pline its members - and indeed, entire corporations and industries. With- out access to the information distributed throughout the CARO network, antivirus manufacturers are effectively powerless to respond to threats, a situation that CARO members exploit to their own advantage. Although some manufacturers have attempted to circumvent CARO by forming al- ternative networks of experts and informants, CARO continues to main- 1055</page><page sequence="3">TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE OCTOBER 2010 VOL. 51 tain almost exclusive control over the global antivirus industry. In the last chapter of the book, Johnston addresses directly the Eurocentric and highly masculine culture of CARO: as of the book's publication, there were no Asian members of CARO, no South American members, no African mem- bers, and no female members of any nationality (p. 182). In addition to her detailed discussion of the producers of computer security expertise and innovation, Johnston also provides an insightful anal- ysis of the users of antivirus technology. In this case, "user" is a complicated category: although one imagined user of antivirus technology is, of course, the individual, the primary user is actually the corporate IT department. Johnston charts the complex relationship between these users, who are often denigrated by antivirus experts as naive or technologically deficient: on the one hand, these corporate users represent large and important markets for the antivirus vendors; on the other, it is the vendors who control access to knowledge and are therefore able to frame the terms of the technological de- bate. Drawing on concepts from the social construction of technology liter- ature, Johnston suggests that within the corporate context, antivirus tech- nology is "never closed or stabilized," but instead "continually assessed, critiqued, explained, worked around, and redesigned in response to inputs from antivirus industry professionals, new technological innovations, and new threats from spam, spim [spam via instant messaging], and vulnerabil- ities on cell phones" (p. 121). The maintenance of corporate computer secu- rity is therefore a complex and multifaceted sociotechnological process, one which generates new forms of knowledge and expertise, transforms organi- zational relationships, and redistributes power and authority. Technological Turf Wars is an exciting addition to a small but growing literature on the history and sociology of software. For historians of tech- nology, it points the way toward the integration of the history of software into the larger historiography of our field.
