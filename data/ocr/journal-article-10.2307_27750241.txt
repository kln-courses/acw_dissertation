<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO TYPES OF OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION* Abstract: In the proems of Ovid's Amores, Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris, the speaker manipulates various types of personification in his characterizations of amor, fallaciously advancing the notion that love is conquerable. I use Hesiodic and Platonic models o/eros to identify two types of personified amor in Ovid's love poetry and the ways they are used to mislead the reader. There has been no shortage of scholarly attention to amor in Ovid's poetry1 in the last several decades.2 This attention is warranted, for the speaker of the Amores, Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris openly declares the centrality of amor to his poetry, but uses the term in so many ways that its meaning is never certain. As has been pointed out, words like amor and amare paradoxically designate both a passively experienced emotion and an actively con trolled and practiced art form. In this article, I draw attention to the characterizations of amor in Ovid's elegiac proems and identify per sonification as one of the tricks used to construct them.3 In support of my conclusions, I look to Hesiod and Plato for representative views of ancient eros that the poet-lover incorporated in his own depictions of amor. By employing, yet surreptitiously manipulating, familiar models of eros / amor, he allows careful or ideal readers to distinguish themselves from inattentive readers, who are marked by a failure to recognize the deliberate textual confusion surrounding personifica tions of amor} * Thanks are owed to Sharon L. James for reading numerous drafts of this article, to David Carlisle and an audience at CAMWS-Southern Section for listening to an early version, and to the editor, S. Douglas Olson, and the anonymous referees of The Classical Journal for their challenging and helpful suggestions. 11 use the name "Ovid" and the term "poet" intentionally, but only on rare occa sion to refer to the historical author of the Amor es, Ars Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, Fasti, etc. As Durling (1958) 157 astutely remarks, "The figure of the author which appears in a literary work is distinct from the author himself." For the "figure of the author," I use "speaker," "poet-lover" or " praeceptor." 2 Cf. Fyler (1971); Myerowitz (1985); Athanassaki (1992). For a summary of recent scholarship, see Green (2006) 5-8. 3 I focus on the proems because of their recognized role in setting the tone for Ovid's works. The significance of Ovidian proems has been discussed by e.g. Kenney (1976); Ahern (1990); Moles (1991); Buchan (1995); Gildenhard and Zissos (2000). 4 For a useful exploration of various types of readers, see Gibson (1980); Prince (1980).

THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 104.3 (2009) 22^-40</page><page sequence="2">226 ARUM PARK The term personification has been applied to a broad range of literary phenomena, but uses of it can be roughly divided into two categories: "personification" refers either to inanimate objects given human characteristics, or to abstractions that are not characterized but have been elevated to the level of divinity. Just as abstract con cepts endowed with human emotion and corporeality are personifi cations, so are mere abstractions that have been immortalized. The speaker of the Ars Amatoria uses both types of personification in his proem, but vacillates almost imperceptibly between the two. He re fers to amor as an emotional force which, although personified in the sense that it is divinized, is essentially amorphous and abstract, but in the same passage he switches to a conception of Amor as a god with human appearance and agency. This slippage does not appear in the beginning of the Amores, where the two types of personification are distinguished by the names Cupid and Amor. The Amores begins with a personification of love under the name Cupid (1.1.1-4):5 Arma6 graui numero uiolentaque bella parabam edere, materia conueniente modis. par erat inferior uersus; risisse Cupido dicitur atque unum surripuisse pedem. Arms and violent wars was I prepared to produce in serious meter with content fitting the measures. The second line used to be of equal length; Cupid is said to have laughed and snatched away one foot.7 The speaker explains that his original epic project has been forcibly derailed by Cupid. By so naming the saboteur, he establishes his own persona as a poet under the control of love, the power of which he emphasizes through his method of personification. This Cupid is a personification in my first sense: fully anthropomorphized and char acterized as a mischievous, thieving rascal.8 The poet-lover continues to characterize Love as a being with human traits and agency (23-5): lunauitque genu sinuosum fortiter arcum "quod"que "canas, uates, accipe" dixit "opus." me miserum! certas habuit puer ille sagittas. 51 use the Oxford Classical Text of E.J. Kenney. 6 On the allusion to Vergil, see Keith (1992) 328, esp. n. 4, in which she credits Otis (1938) 198 n. 32 as the first to point out the allusion. 7 Translations of the Amoves, Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris are my own and are deliberately literal. 8 According to McKeown (1989) ad 1.1.3-4, there is no precedent for this conceit of Cupid snatching away a metrical foot, but the characterization echoes Hellenistic portrayals of Eros.</page><page sequence="3">OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION 227 And he bent his pliant bow on his knee with his strength and said, "Receive the kind of work you would sing." Wretched me! That boy had unerring arrows. These lines again characterize Cupid as humanized, a fully corporeal being who interacts verbally with the poet and is able to create trou ble for him, even rendering him incapable of impassivity.9 Cupid in lines 23-5 is to be distinguished from Amor in line 26: uror, et in uacuo pectore regnat Amor10 ("I burn, and in my empty breast Love rules," 1.1.26). Cupid is an external god whose independent ex istence is reinforced by his willful character, whereas Amor repre sents an internal emotion.11 Amor is not akin to Cupid, for Amor is an abstraction rather than a tangible being and thus represents my second type of personification. Unlike Cupid, Amor does not possess human attributes or abilities so much as embody them. The personification of Amor, of course, depends on the discre tion of the editor, who must choose whether or not to capitalize the initial "A." Line 26 could just as easily be printed uror, et in uacuo pectore regnat amor, more accurately reflecting the block capitals a Roman would have read: UROR ET IN VACVO PECTORE REGNAT AMOR. Personification might thus seem a moot point, for as Feeney (discussing Roman religion) observes, "The clarity enforced by mod ern printing conventions [i.e., capitalization of proper names] ... may obscure the advantages accruing to a mentality that did not rigidly impose demarcations between words, qualities, and instantiations, and that could fruitfully mobilise this indeterminacy in an improvi sational spirit."12 My aim, however, is to detect nuances of personification that the inattentive reader, ancient or modern, might overlook. Whether or not amor is capitalized is not the issue so much as how it is characterized. By presenting amor as an abstraction capable of profound mind control, the speaker may also imply its divinity, as in Hesiod's Theog ony, where eros is both abstract and divine. Indeed, the Amor of Amores 1.1.26 bears a striking resemblance to Hesiodic Eros (Th. 120-2): fiB' "Epog, 05 kocXXigtos ev d?aVOCTOlGl 0EOIOI, XuaipeXris, TrdvTcov te ?ecov ttocvtcov t1 dvSpcoTrcov oduvaTai ev gtm?eggi voov kcci ?TTi9pova ?ouXriv.13 9 Cf. Gildenhard and Zissos (2000) 71, who point out that Cupid is endowed with such a degree of agency that, by preventing the speaker from composing an epic, he takes away any possible "epic detachment." 10 On the meaning of uacuo in Am. 1.1.26, see McKeown ad 1.1.25-6. 11 Keith (1992) 341 notes echoes of Prop. 1.1.1-4 in the names Cupid and Amor in Am. 1.1. 12 Feeney (1998) 88. 131 cite the text of West (1966).</page><page sequence="4">228 ARUM PARK ...and Eros, most beautiful among the immortal gods, limb-weakener, who conquers the mind and sensible thought in the breasts of all gods and all men.14 The italicized phrases here and in Amores 1.1.26 highlight the points of responsion between the texts.15 Hesiod's Eros is not an exact paral lel for the Amor of Amores 1.1, for Eros is able to conquer the minds of both gods and men, while Amor's influence is localized to the poet-speaker. Furthermore, the characterization of Eros is more am biguous, for his loveliness (kqAAigtos, 120) offsets his dangerous power to disarm mental capacities (SdjivaTai ev cnf)0eoGi v?ov kou ETri9pova ?ouArjv, 122), whereas Amor's similarly fearsome power, consuming the poet-lover's heart and causing him to burn, has no mitigating beauty. But in one crucial way, the Amor of Amores 1.1.26 closely resembles the Eros of Th. 120-2: both are abstract forces that affect minds from within. The original location of Eros?does he conquer from without or within??is uncertain, but the ultimate in teriority of Eros and Amor is clear, as ev oTT|6Eaai parallels in uacuo pectore. The profound effects Amor and Eros share suggest similar conceptions of them as both eternal and divine forces. Although my aim is not to argue for a strict allusion to Hesiod's Eros, one would be unsurprising, since the speaker of Amores 1.1, in contrast to the other Roman elegists, constructs himself as a self conscious and literary poet.16 Moreover, the praeceptor of the Ars Amatoria, who presents himself as the speaker of the Amores, nods to the poet of the Theogony when he mentions the Muses and addresses Ascra at Ars 1.27-8: nec mihi sunt uisae Clio Cliusque sorores I seruanti pecudes uallibus, Ascra, tuis; and again when he refers to the man of Ascra at Ars 2.3-4: laetus amans donat uiridi mea carmina palma/praelata Ascraeo Maeonioque seni.17 In the absence of a clear reference to Hesiod in the Amores, however, this resemblance can at most be called an in 14 Translations of the Theogony are adapted from Caldwell (1989). 15 Keith (1992) 343 detects an echo of Prop. 1.1.34 et nullo uacuus tempore defit Amor in Am. 1.1.26. Considering the poet-lover's tendency to allude to Roman elegy, I am inclined to agree, and my comparison to Hesiod is not intended to preclude other intertexts. 16 See Gildenhard and Zissos (2000) 72: "[The poet of the Amores] replaces a pur posefully naive poetic persona with a deliberately self-conscious one which seems constantly to be aware of and pun on the fact that it moves within a generic universe of a highly literary and topical nature." Whether the self-consciousness of the persona in Am. 1.1 persists in subsequent poems, particularly Am. 1.2, is a matter of debate: see Cameron (1968) 320-2; McKeown (1989) 33; Moles (1991). 17 For comparisons between the personae of the Ars and the Amores, see Ars 3.343^1. As Volk (2002) 167 points out, Ars 1.21-4 also recalls the saeuus puer of Am. 1.1.5, and numerous scenarios in the Ars echo experiences described by the poet of the Amores (e.g., Ars 1.135-6 and Am. 3.2; Ars 1.351-2 and 375-6 and Am. 2.7 and 2.8; Ars 2.435-6 and Am. 2.7).</page><page sequence="5">OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION 229 tertext rather than an allusion.18 In any case, my concern is not so much whether these echoes constitute intertext or allusion as how this verbal echo helps clarify the distinction between Cupid and Amor. In Amores 1.1, Amor, as an internal force, is distinct from Cupid, an external god. The poet-lover of the Amores thus distinguishes be tween two types of love and uses distinct terms for each. As Wlosok notes, he also referred to the duality of love at Fast. 4.1: Alma, fave, dixi, geminorum mater Amorum ("Nurturing mother of the twin Loves, give favor, I say").19 As Wlosok demonstrates, the existence of two distinct gods Cupid and Amor is well attested in previous Latin lit erature in sources ranging from Cato to Plautus.20 By discussing the difference between the abstract nouns cupido and amor, Wlosok ar gues that Cupid represents desire, while Amor is the god of affec tion. While this difference is not reflected in Amores 1.1, Wlosok's study does support the notion of a discernible distinction between Cupid and Amor employed by the poet-lover of the Amores. Hesiod's Theogony again proves useful, this time by providing two distinct Erotes as a parallel for the Cupid-Amor difference in Amores 1.1. Eros first appears as a god born in the same generation as Gaia and Tartaros (Jh. 116-20): rjTOl UEV TTpCOTlGTa Xdoc yEVET1- aUT?p ETTEITCC Tar EupuGTEpvog, TrdvTcov e5oc do9aXEs cue! dSavdTcov oT e'xougi Kapn vicpoEVToc 'OXuuttou, TdpTccpd t' rjEpoEVTa uuxcp x?ovos Eupuoosins, T\h" "Epog, ?s KdXXiGTOs ev d?avaToioi ?eoigi. First of all Chaos came into being; but next wide-breasted Gaia, ever-secure foundation of all the immortals who inhabit the peaks of snowy Olympos, and dim Tartaros in a recess of the wide-pathed earth, and Eros, who is the most beautiful among the immortal gods. As West notes, Eros' early birth marks his indispensable role in gen eration and reproduction.21 Eros next appears as the attendant of Aphrodite (Th. 201-2): Tfj 5' "Epos cbudp-rnoE Kai "luspos eotteto kccX?s yEivouEvrj tq TrpcoTa Secov t' es (p?Xov iouoT]. 18 For allusion and intertextuality, see Conte (1986); Hinds (1998); Edmunds (2001).

For intertextuality within the Ovidian corpus itself, i.e., Ovidian allusion to other Ovidian works, see Kennedy (2006); Miller (2006). Cf. Myers (1999) 191-6 for an excellent survey of Ovidian scholarship dealing with intertextuality. 19 See Wlosok (1975). 20 See Wlosok (1975) 172-4. 21 West (1966) ad 120.</page><page sequence="6">230 ARUM PARK Eros accompanied her, and fair Himeros followed, when first she was born and went to join the gods. West observes that this later Eros differs from the earlier "primeval" power,22 but Vernant and Rudhardt go further, to articulate two dis tinct Erotes in Hesiod's Theogony differing primarily with respect to their reproductive roles.23 The first Eros facilitates the parthenogenic births of Ouranos (Th. 126-7), the mountains (129) and Pontos (131-2) from Gaia, and thus prompts generation through division as off spring are produced from within Gaia. The role of the second Eros, companion of Aphrodite, is to join two distinct deities in sexual union, effecting cooperative reproduction rather than individual di vision. Simply put, the first Eros works from within, whereas the second is an external force. The Cupid and Amor of Amor es 1.1 reflect an external-internal distinction similar to that between Hesiod's two Erotes. As noted above, Amor in Amor es 1.1.26 most closely resembles this first Eros, who works from within, for both affect individuals internally. Al though Amor does not cause the speaker to reproduce asexually, the inner turmoil of Amor parallels the internal disruption caused by Hesiod's first Eros. The interaction between the speaker and Cupid, by contrast, mirrors the external role assumed by Hesiod's second Eros, who appears after two distinct sexes have been established in the cosmos. As the companion of Aphrodite, this Eros is external to the beings it affects, uniting male and female entities for sexual re production. The Ovidian Cupid, who influences and interacts with the poet-lover of the Amores from without, resembles this second Eros. The Hesiodic model of Eros thus helps conceptualize the dif ferent personifications of Cupid and Amor in Amores 1.1 as a differ ence between external and internal forces, articulated by a distinction of names. This clear demarcation does not persist in the later elegiac pro ems. The proem to the Ars Amatoria conflates the two types of love by abandoning the precision of terms in Amores 1.1 (Ars 1.1-4): Si quis in hoc artem populo non nouit amandi, hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet. arte citae ueloque rates remoque mouentur, arte leues currus: arte regendus Amor. If anyone in this nation does not know the art of loving, let him read and learn from this poem and let him love. By art are swift ships moved through sail and oar, by art are light chariots moved: Amor must be ruled by art. 22 See West (1966) ad 120 and 201. 23 Vernant (1990) 466, citing Rudhardt (1986).</page><page sequence="7">OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION 231 Amandi and amet in the first couplet establish the emotion of amor24 as the subject of the work, while the praeceptor repeatedly uses the term ars to make the (preposterous) claim that mastery of this emotion is as feasible as learning a new craft.25 At this point it is uncertain whether amor needs to be capitalized, for the praeceptor seemingly refers to an abstract emotion, although he attempts to make it con crete by comparing it to tangible objects such as ships and chariots.26 But subsequent lines reveal a fully personified Amor, anthropomor phized and endowed with agency (9-10): ille quidem ferus est et qui mihi saepe repugnet; sed puer est, aetas mollis et apta regi. He indeed is fierce and the type who would often fight back against me; but he is a boy, an age that is soft and fit to be ruled. For the first time in the proem to the Ars, the praeceptor characterizes Amor as a fully corporeal entity who engages the poet as an oppo nent. The speaker describes a boy (puer) of vulnerable age (aetas mollis) over whom the praeceptor may exert control (apta regi). This characterization reflects the paradox of Amor, intensely powerful yet young enough to be malleable. By conflating the external god and the internal emotion under the name Amor, the speaker attempts to argue that an unruly amorphous force can be contained in the figure of a little boy and controlled like a disobedient child. It is in the Ars that Amor begins to resemble Platonic formula tions of eros. A faint echo of Plato27 appears in Amor's youthful deli cacy: Agathon in Plato's Symposium similarly describes Eros as soft, youthful and malleable (vecotcctoc. hev or] egti kc? aTraXcbTaTog, Trpoc. 5e toutois uyp?c. to eToos,28 "Indeed, he is youngest and most soft and also supple in form," Smp. 196a). Both the Platonic and Ovidian characterizations reflect conventional depictions of the love-god, whose youthfulness appears in art of the 5th century BCE, if not ear 24 On the nature of amor in the Ars, see Volk (2006); Myerowitz Levine (2006). 25 Cf. Dimundo (2003) 31-2: "Nel distico iniziale particolare insistenza e accorda ta all'aspetto teorico deH'amore, che si configura come un'ars: su tale concetto l'autore interverra subito dopo in maniera piu circostanziata; caratterizzato com'e essenzial mente quale tecnica raffinata, Yamor perde l'impronta passionale ed estemporanea, per assumere i contorni precisi di una disciplina, i cui elementi teorici costitutivi van no acquisiti prima di accostarsi alia pratica." 26 Cf. Heldmann (1981) 162, who argues that amor should not be capitalized here, as its double meaning has not yet been activated. 271 use the terms "Plato" and "Platonic" to refer not to Platonic philosophy but to literature attributed to Plato. 28 I rely on Burnet's Oxford Classical Text of Plato's Symposium and provide my own translations.</page><page sequence="8">232 ARUM PARK Her.29 But the echo is all the more striking for the similarities between the contexts. Agathon's description is motivated by his desire for greater specificity in the characterization of Eros,30 who thus far in the Symposium has been praised for the gifts he conveys rather than for his character. Agathon provides a physical description of the god and posits that his physical attributes enable his movement and mir ror his beneficial effects.31 In Ovid, Amor lingers as a nebulous entity before becoming firmly embodied and characterized. In giving Amor a specific, physical shape, the praeceptor's description reflects a tradi tion of capturing the love-god in the form of a youthful boy as an effort toward greater specificity. In the first five couplets of the Ars Amatoria, amor has progressed from an abstract, internal emotion to a fully concretized, characterized and externalized personification. Amor is no longer a nebulous emotion within the mind, but an ex ternalized entity over whom the poet-lover stands a greater chance of exerting control.32 Amor's progression from abstract to concrete stalls in the lines that follow, in which the praeceptor compares Amor to the warrior Achilles, who was fearsome to all men but fearful before his teacher Chiron (11-16), and concludes this comparison with a grand but mystifying claim (17-18): Aeacidae Chiron, ego sum praeceptor Amoris; saeuus uterque puer, natus uterque dea. 29 E.g., the east frieze of the Parthenon; see Gantz (1993) 4. For an image, see Elderkin (1936) 93.

Kleve (1983); Dillon (1994); and Gibson (2003) 13-19 have all traced erotodidaxis and the phrase ars amatoria to Socratic traditions concerning epcotiki1) texvti. Furthermore, the praeceptor himself quotes the advice of the Delphic oracle to know oneself {Ars 2.501), a clear allusion to Socratic philosophy (PI. Ap. 38a), while the many depictions of Cupid in the Metamorphoses are likely based on the work of previous philosophers, revealing the poet's familiarity with philosophical constructions of love. See Stephens (1958), who argues that Cupid in the Metamorphoses derives from Empedoclean, Py thagorean, Orphic and Lucretian descriptions of love. Although an allusion to Plato is not certain, the praeceptor's Plato-like manipulation of amor and his familiarity with Greek philosophy suggest Platonic influence, whether direct or indirect. At the very least, the Platonic echoes help illuminate the manipulative possibilities of amor.</page><page sequence="9">OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION 233 Chiron was the teacher of Achilles, I am the teacher of Amor; each boy was unruly, each born from a goddess. The phrase praeceptor Amoris is surprising, for the force of the geni tive is ambiguous and thus conflates an anthropomorphic Amor and the abstract amor. The opening of the Ars led us to believe that the poem would provide instruction on how to love (artem ... amandi ... amet, 1.1-2). But when the speaker declares himself the praeceptor Amoris, it is in the context of an analogy between himself and Chi ron, and between Amor and Achilles. Amor, then, is the speaker's pupil, not the subject he will teach. Hollis astutely points out the un expected meaning of these lines, ruling out any ambiguity: "We ex pect [praeceptor Amoris] to mean 'a teacher of love,' ... so it is a surprise that Ovid means here 'the tutor of Cupid.' A play on two levels by which 'amoris' = at once love and Cupid ... would be unwelcome, since 'Amoris' must balance 'Aeacidae' and both be picked up by 'uterque puer.'"33 Hollis' insistence is understandable, since the grammatical func tion of the genitive Amoris is clear. As he himself acknowledges, however, the phrase praeceptor amoris is used elsewhere in the Ovid ian corpus to mean "teacher of (the subject of) love."34 Moreover, in light of the shifting nature of amor in the preceding lines,35 the phrase praeceptor Amoris is more likely intentionally ambiguous. The inter play between abstract and concrete suggests that the genitive Amoris can be read either as a possessive genitive within the context of the couplet or as an objective genitive within the context of the whole proem.36 As Volk points out, amor tends to be ambiguous in Ovidian poetry, so the Amor I amor confusion here would not be unusual.37 The praeceptor's intentionally ambiguous use of the genitive am oris is unique to Ovid; a passage from Plato's Symposium displays a similar grammatical playfulness (Smp. 199c-d): l'6l ouv UOl TTEpl "EpCOTOS, ETTElOr] kc?

I do not ask whether it is of some mother or father?for it would be a ridiculous question whether Love is love of a mother or a father?but as it would be if I were asking this very thing about the father, namely is the father the father of someone or not? Surely you would have said to me, if you desired to answer correctly, that the father is a father of a son, at least, or of a daughter, right? In defining love as something that exists in relation to something else, Socrates confuses Agathon by manipulating the objective and subjective / possessive genitives governed by eros. Socrates draws a misleading parallel with the possessive genitive governed by phrases such as "father of so-and-so," diverting Agathon's attention from the other possible meaning of "love of someone." Eventually, Socrates leads Agathon to agree that Love desires its object: togovSe 6e eitte, TTOTEpOV 6 "EpcOS EKEIVOU OU EGTIV EpCOS, ETTl?UUEl CCUTO? f) Ol); ("And tell me this much: does Love desire that person of whom there is love, or not?" Strip. 200a). Socrates thus formulates the emotion of love as an active entity by sneaking in a personification of love and blurring its distinction from the abstract, non-personified emotion.38 The passage from the Symposium demonstrates the potential am biguity afforded by the grammatical flexibility of eros and the inten tional use of this ambiguity for argumentative purposes. In arguing for the instability of Agathon's conceptualization of eros, Socrates manipulates various senses of the word and subtly incorporates a personification Agathon is unable to detect. The Platonic passage provides an illuminating parallel for the ambiguity of amor in the Ars, where the speaker employs a similarly surreptitious personifica tion with the phrase praeceptor Amor is and exploits its ambiguity. The differences between the Symposium and the Ars shed further light on the praeceptor's tactics and the implied reader he constructs. By casting Agathon as a dupe entrapped by Socrates' captious ques tions, Plato encourages scrutiny of Socrates' argumentation. The be fuddled Agathon represents an inattentive "reader" of Socrates' arguments, while the implied readers become ideal readers who detect their flaws. By contrast, the praeceptor of the Ars facilitates no such recognition of his tricks, for in the absence of an Agathon-like figure within the Ars, the implied reader is himself the dupe. In addi tion to elucidating the grammatical flexibility (or ambiguity) afforded by amor lews, comparison between the Platonic and Ovidian passages also reveals the comparative subtlety of the praeceptor's misdirection. 38 Cf. Dover (1980) ad 199d3, who also highlights the confusion surrounding the objective and possessive genitives: "If anyone, through inattention to the exact form of Socrates' question, replied, 'Eros is (sc. son) of X' ... he would unwittingly be saying, 'the father of Eros is the object of eros.'"</page><page sequence="11">OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION 235 The slippage between amor and Amor demonstrates the confusion generated when various types of personification are used inter changeably. The praeceptor's amor/Amor ambiguity reflects a long tradi tion of speaking about amor in intentionally imprecise terms in order to distract an interlocutor, or in the praeceptor's case, a pupil/reader. Again, a comparison can be made to a version of Platonic Eros, this time provided by Phaedrus, who presents the first praise of Eros in the Symposium and begins with a claim that Eros is the oldest god (Smp. 178a-b):39 to yap ev T0T5 TrpEo?uTaTov Eivai t?v 0E?V Tiuiov, f\ 5' 05, TEKurjpiov 8e toutou yovfjs yap "Eporros out' eigiv o?te ?EyovTai utt' ouBev?c; oute ioicotou oute TToinTou, ?XX1 'Hai'oSos TrpcoTov uev Xdog &lt;pnai ysvsoSai? a?Tap ETfEiTa Tar EupuGTEpvog, TrdvTcov E'805 docpaXsg aisi, f]5' "Epog. "For/7 Phaedrus said, "there is proof of this, namely that the god is honorable among the oldest deities: for the parents of Eros neither exist, nor are spoken of by anyone, layman or poet, but Hesiod says that Chaos was born first? 'And then broad-breasted Gaia, eternally safe seat of all, and Eros/" Phaedrus' quotation and interpretation of Hesiod is incomplete,40 for not only does he omit the birth of Tartaros in these lines, but he fails to note Eros' association with Aphrodite at Theogony 201-2. By ignor ing, or perhaps eliding, the latter passage, Phaedrus oversimplifies the functions of Eros in Hesiod. He subsequently praises Eros for the benefits conferred on a lover by his beloved and vice versa (Smp. 178d 9b), thus commending him as a force that brings people together and citing Hesiod as proof that this Eros is the oldest force in the uni verse. But this first Eros in the Theogony, as noted earlier, divides from within rather than uniting from without, so that Phaedrus bases his argument, perhaps deliberately, on an erroneous conflation of the two Hesiodic Erotes and a manipulation of Hesiod's text. Phaedrus' vague conception of Eros is apparent even to the other speakers in the Symposium: Pausanias criticizes his speech by claim ing that praise of Love is complicated by the existence of two types 39 For the relationship between the Symposium and the Theogony, see Salman (1991). 40 I quote the full passage on p. 229, above. Some editors omit lines 118-19 of the Theogony and likely base their decision on this quotation by Phaedrus. But Phaedrus' omission intentionally contributes to his incomplete and inconsistent portrayal of Eros. Cf. West (1966) 192-3 and Miller (1983), who argue for preserving the omitted lines; their arguments are summarized in Salman (1991) 221 n. 22.</page><page sequence="12">236 ARUM PARK of Eros (180c-e), although he does not base his argument on the Theogony. Phaedrus' speech shows how eros can be oversimplified and misrepresented, and his misuse of Hesiod reveals the type of reader the speaker of the Ars expects to trick with the phrase praecep tor Amoris. Like Phaedrus' praise of Eros, the praeceptor's characteri zation of Amor slips between two types of amor, the external god and the internal emotion. The obvious difference is that the extent to which Phaedrus' conflation is purposeful is unclear, whereas the praeceptor is intentionally imprecise, hoping for an inattentive reader. My examinations of Amores 1.1 and the Ars* Amatoria have re vealed two treatments of love in Ovid's love poetry, one that differ entiates between external and internal love by using different terms for each (Cupid and Amor), another that obscures this difference by subsuming both types under the name Amor. The praeceptor's con struction of Amor within the first 20 lines of the Ars progresses from internal emotion to external deity, but pivots between the two with the phrase praeceptor Amoris. In short, the praeceptor blurs the distinc tion between the god Amor and the emotion amor. The poet-lover's complex manipulation of amor provides further evidence for his gen ius: he is not only clever but extremely learned in tropes from litera ture outside the generic bounds of his own poetry. But there are implications for the readership of the Amores and Ars as well.41 Be yond the actual or historical readers of the text, the Amores and Ars, with their artfully imprecise personifications, construct an ideal reader who will perceive and comprehend the poet-lover's verbal maneuvers. The ideal reader need not perceive these maneuvers as strict allusions, but his familiarity with a variety of literary works and genres will enable him to recognize the poet-lover's trickery.42 The ideal reader possesses the acuity, perhaps informed by literary comparanda,43 to recognize where the praeceptor's formulations of amor are inconsistent or misleading, and will appreciate the adeptness of the praeceptor's misdirection of the careless (non-ideal) reader. This ideal reader, when turning to the Remedia Amoris, will not be fooled (Rem. 1-4): 41 As Gibson (1999) convincingly argues, the poet demonstrates awareness of and concern about the readership and reception of his poetry. 42 Pace Pasquali (1968) 275: "allusions do not produce the desired effect if the reader does not clearly remember the text to which they refer," cited in Conte (1986) 24-5. Pasquali myopically suggests that a poet's references to previous works serve solely to draw attention to those works rather than to add depth or complexity to his own poetry, and fails to take into account the various types of readers implicated in a text (such as the actual reader, the implied reader and the ideal reader). Failure to recognize a strict allusion does produce the desired effect in one type of reader, the inattentive (implied) reader whom the praeceptor tries to trick. 43 These Hesiodic and Platonic constructions of eros are but a few of many possi ble comparanda.</page><page sequence="13">OVIDIAN PERSONIFICATION 237 Legerat huius Amor titulum nomenque libelli: "bella mihi, uideo, bella parantur" ait. "parce tuum uatem sceleris damnare, Cupido, tradita qui toties te duce signa tuli." Amor had read the title and name of this little book. He said: "Wars, I see, wars are in store for me." "Stop condemning your poet for a crime, Cupid, I who so often bore the standards entrusted to me under your leadership." Here the praeceptor no longer employs his Amor-Cupid distinction, but uses the two names interchangeably. It may seem permissible for him to do so, for he has obliterated the distinction in the proem to the Ars and may therefore equate Cupid and Amor in the Remedia Amoris. By capitalizing on the grammatical and conceptual ambigui ties of amor in the Ars, the praeceptor reformulates the earlier Cupid Amor distinction of Amores 1.1 and admits that precise bifurcation between the two no longer suits his purposes. The ideal reader, however, has read the Ars, understands the grammatical ambiguities of amor, and thus perceives the conflation of Amor and amor. When the praeceptor later boasts that he has finally learned how to control Amor, the ideal reader does not believe him (Rem. 7-10): saepe tepent alii iuuenes; ego semper amaui, et si, quid faciam, nunc quoque, quaeris, amo. quin etiam docui qua possis arte parari, et, quod nunc ratio est, impetus ante fuit. Other youths often grow lukewarm; I have always loved, and if you ask what I am doing, even now I am in love. Indeed I have even taught by what art you could be handled, and what is now reason was passion before. By this point, the praeceptor has collapsed the Cupid-Amor distinction in the Ars, and in the Remedia he further reduces Amor to a trivial entity he can now control. Thus, Amor's role as an overwhelming force does not appear at all in the Remedia. The speaker of the Amores and Ars has given full corporeal form to his personification of Amor. By externalizing the internal emotion of love in the Ars, the praeceptor misleads the inattentive reader of the Remedia into thinking that love is controllable, and thus purports to fulfill the double promise he made with the phrase praeceptor Amoris, for he is both an instructor of love and the teacher and commander of Cupid. But the ideal reader perceives the flaws in these formulations and recognizes the failure of the praeceptor's promise.44 44 On the failure of the Remedia, cf. Fulkerson (2004).</page><page sequence="14">238 ARUM PARK By identifying this complex personification strategy, the ideal reader will look beyond the poet-lover persona and recognize that a real poet lies behind the speaker, a poet skillful at incorporating and manipulating various types of personification. The ideal reader will see beyond the superficial poetic persona and perceive, if only par tially, Ovid's manipulation of personification and the depth and breadth of his literary knowledge. Moreover, the ideal reader will perceive the other readers implied by the text, readers who are care less, less educated or more easily fooled than the ideal reader. An understanding of the poet's misdirection thus deepens an apprecia tion of the task of the ideal reader, who by comprehending the poet's strategic misdirection of the inattentive reader, will also recognize his construction of that very reader within the text.
