Semantic idolators, because their perspective is literary rather than religious, begin their interpretive work penultimately, at the level of the religious model, rather than ultimately, at the religious disclosure the model was designed to evoke. The primary hazard of semantic idolatry for literary criticism is that it encourages the production of non-religious accounts of essentially religious activities. This discussion argues for a religious reading of Paradise Lost, one which recognizes that religious and literary claims are not always compatible. Acknowledging that the logic of religious communication behaves differently from that of secular, the study attempts to demonstrate that many crucial narrative difficulties in the epic make com- pelling religious sense, once it is understood that religious evocation held higher priority in Milton's intention than aesthetic or ethical decorum. In lieu of the usual literary procedure of testing the aesthetic and ethical values of Paradise Lost for their internal decorum, I would like to sound the religious depth of the epic - its affectiveness not as an object of literary and moral symmetry but as an evocation of religious wonder and mystery. My concern for the religious vocation of the poem is inspired by Geddes MacGregor's obvious, but nonetheless trenchant, point that "the raison d'être of a 'work of art' is to stimulate the aesthetic experience that has been, so to speak, deposited in it. The raison (Tètre of a 'holy thing' is to stimulate experience in certain direction , namely (in the long run) mystical union with God."1 To ignore Paradise Losťs dual capacity as a "holy thing" and a "work of art" and further to ignore the priority and inter- dependence of these two functions strikes me as curiously short-sighted. And yet, the religious vocation of the poem seems consistently to take a very subordinate place in the concerns of most critics. The consequence of such slights of the religious mission of the epic inevitably is a garbled concept of the nature of the response Milton hoped to evoke. To assist in an appraisal of Paradise Lost as a "holy thing" I propose a reading of the epic which will be as obedient as possible to the following assumptions: that Paradise Lost was written by a concerned Christian poet, for a concerned Christian readership, and that it was intended to be read as a specimen of distinctly Christian expression. By "distinctly Christian 1 Geddes MacGregor, Aesthetic Experience in Religion (London, 1947), p. 212.</page><page sequence="2">388 THOMAS F. MERRILL expression" I do not mean discourse incidentally about Christian topics, even though it may exploit Christian diction and symbol; I mean language which is of the Christian experience - Christian through and through down to its very behavior and structure. To put the matter in a slightly different way, I hope to show that a great deal of what goes on religiously in Paradise Lost is generally inaccessible to readers who, unlike their seven- teenth» century Christian predecessors, are unsophisticated in the eccentric behavior of religious language. Religious language is eccentric because of the nature of its subject. "God," as E. L. Mascall points out, "is by definition an infinite and supra- sensible being, while all the language that we have in which to talk about him has been devised in order to describe and discuss the finite objects of our sense experience."1 Religious language, of course, is an attempt to reach an accommodation between infinite subject and finite speech and, while it can claim no distinctive formal properties of its own, it is idiosyncratic in that it is ordinary language put to special use . That special use is communication to and about God. There are many ways in which God, as the subject of a language system, can tyrannize its entire structure. For one thing, "God" does not take predication in the same way conventional proper nouns do. I. M. Crombie, for example, contends that when theists insist that statements about God must be interpreted as if God were a particular person, they are also insisting upon special immunities for the name in order to assure that it is not drained of religious mystery. If the status of the words "God" and "Michelangelo" are identical, religion loses its distinctive essence as a supramundane category.2 When it is said, for example, that "God created the heaven and the earth," Christian doctrine adds the distinctively odd qualifier "ex nihilo " precisely to preserve the vital difference from the artistic pro- ductions of Michelangelo. The point is that religious language ought never to be read straight- forwardly; it must be read with a clear and aggressive notion of its religious intention. Not only is there the danger that the proper name "God" be drained of its religious mystery, but there is the even subtler peril that narrative situations which were originally set up for religiously evocative 1 Words and Images (London, 1957), p. 93. 2 Faith and Logic (London, 1958), pp. 31-67.</page><page sequence="3">'Paradise Losť 389 purposes be insensitively stripped of their religious status and perversely regarded as mere ethical problems. This peril is particularly hazardous because religious language, by virtue of the fact that its most distinctive feature is its "'analogical' nature",1 necessarily must exploit the close logical kinship that exists between moral and theological relationships in order to communicate its unique truths. Patriotism, for example, while it may not be precisely similar to religious faith, possesses enough structural resemblance to it to warrant its use as a guide to the meaning of a genuine religious commitment. Similarly, eros differs decidedly from agape&gt; yet there is enough analogical reference between them to permit erotic love to serve as a helpful model suggestive of the direction one might look to seek an understanding of divine love.2 The challenge that religious language poses for the literary interpreter is that it is often saying one thing and doing quite another. It gives every appearance many times of focusing primarily upon traditional literary situations when in fact it is exploiting those situations for their effectiveness as religious models. When a consummate literary genius employs the tech- nique there is always the risk that the very effectiveness with which the model is drawn so attracts the religiously unattuned reader that he stalls, perhaps even with critical complacency, at a penultimate level of intended insight and thus forfeits whatever revelation of religious wonder and mystery that these models were originally engineered to evoke. I speak, in other words, of the hazards of a semantic idolatry in which readers of religious texts mistake the means to revelation for the revelation itself. I have found such idolatry widespread in the literature about Paradise Lost . A typical illustration of what I mean by semantic idolatry is A. J. A. Waldock's reading of Book Nine of Paradise Lost in which Adam must choose between sharing Eve's fate or maintaining his obedience to God. According to Waldock, Milton erred in depicting this episode by pre- senting us with "an unbearable collision of values" because we are asked to set aside "one of the highest, and really one of the oldest, of all human values: selflessness in love . . . [for] the mere doctrine that God must be obeyed." He insinuates that Milton himself, although "not in a position to 1 David Crystal and Derek Davy, Investigating English Style , English Language Series (London, 1969), p. 167. 2 A somewhat similar point is made by Ian Ramsey in Religious Language: fan Empirical Placing of Religious Phrases (London, 1957), pp. 49-51.</page><page sequence="4">390 THOMAS F. MERRILL admit it," felt that Adam was doing a "worthy thing" by eating the apple and joining Eve in sin. "Against the law," Waldock adjudges, "against what is theoretically good, against God, he [Adam] deliberately asserts what is for him a higher good and pursues it." The resultant conflict, as Waldock sees it, is that "the poem asks from us, at one and the same time, two incompatible responses. It requires us, not tentatively, not half-heartedly (for there can be no place really for half-heartedness here) but with the full weight of our minds to believe that he did wrong."1 Waldock compiles his brief against Milton very persuasively, accusing him of permitting ethical and divine values to collide. The incompatibility of these values as they converge on Adam "is so critical," he contends, that it cannot be satisfactorily resolved by giving it the label "the typical tragic conflict." To the contrary, Waldock concludes, "The conflict here is in us: it is we who are pulled in two ways, who are denied the full- hearted response that a great tragic theme allows and compels."2 Waldock's assessment of the ethical implications of Adam's dilemma is unquestionably correct in every detail. His error is in failing to read a religious situation religiously. As a consequence he applies the wrong crit- ical yardstick; he assumes that the model situation Milton has depicted is all there is and he proceeds to deliver a literary rather than a religious critique of the circumstances. That his critical attention has been arrested at a penultimate level is clear from the language he uses: our "full-hearted response," "the typical tragic conflict," "the highest, and . . . oldest, of all human values." The implied criteria behind these phrases obviously are the literary man's concern for narrative conflict and overall consistency of ethical and aesthetic values. Because Milton appears to confuse these values, Waldock finds him a casuistic blunderer and a dramatic tyro. Never once does Waldock appear at all aware that he may have been lured into the idolatry of mistaking the moral model for the religious reality behind it. For Waldock, at least, Milton's models are opaque. Very well, how should the scene be read? How can we determine Milton's real intention when he placed Adam in that particular dilemma? Was he simply naive about the nature of the situation in which he placed his hero, as Waldock implies, or could it be that his concern had religious dimensions 1 Paradise Lost and its Critics (Cambridge, 1966), pp. 55-6. 1 Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">'Paradise Losť 391 far beyond the mere narrative plausibility of the moral model he was ex- ploiting for a more profound religious insight? Some illumination comes from the fact that Adam's dilemma, which Waldock finds so disturbing, was a commonplace "case of conscience" throughout Protestant casuistry during the post-Reformation. William Perkins, generally considered the "father" of Protestant casuistry, whom Milton not only read but quoted, had this to say about the "unbearable collision of values" that Waldock sees in Adam's dilemma. After declaring that "when two commandements of the morali law are opposite in respect of us; so as we cannot doe them both at the same time; the lesser commaundement give place to the greater, and doth not bind or constraine for that instant," Perkins provides an example which, for all intents and purposes, parallels Adam's dilemma precisely: "Example, I. God commaunds one thing, &amp; the magistrate com- maundes the flat contrarie; in this case which of these commaundements is to be oby ed, Honour God, or Honour the Magistrate? the answer is, that the latter must give place to the former, and the former alone in this case must be obeyed: Act. 4.19 Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather then God , judge ye."1 Perkins' case of conscience confirms Waldock's contention that Adam's dilemma, as Milton presents it, confronts us with "an unbearable collision of values," but why must we account this Milton's mistake when it was so obviously his intention? Milton was not primarily concerned with pre- senting a "typical tragic conflict" nor even depicting "powerful human values" in this scene. His primary goal was much more ambitious. Out of the apparent collision of divine and human values in Adam's predica- ment, he sought to re-create the challenge for us of Acts 4.19: "Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge ye." With the epic before us we do not need the didactic counsel of William Perkins that love and honor to God must be valued, painful as it seems, above love and honor to one's wife, because Milton places us in direct dramatic participation with Adam in the struggle. There is no question, as Waldock says, that "we are pulled in two ways" as we read the episode; Milton intended for us to be ! Adam's dilemma forces us, as perhaps we cannot force ourselves, to set our values straight. It is the "more worthy" thing that Adam love and obey God than that he covet, however gallantly, Eve. 1 William Perkins : 1558-/602, ed. Thomas F. Merrill (Nieuwkoop, 1966), p. 11.</page><page sequence="6">392 THOMAS F. MERRILL To be sure, we may argue along with Waldock that God requires a morally reprehensible duty of Adam, but the point is just that. This is not pri- marily a moral but, if I may stress the distinction, a theological situation. The discernment engineered by Milton here precisely parallels that under- lying the story of Abraham and Isaac: that the love of God must be set above all other loves - even that of wife or son. By fixing our attention upon the potential religious yield of the episode rather than on its apparent moral and aesthetic implausibilities, we rise from a narrow literary bias toward the epic to a more rewarding Christian orientation, one, incidentally, that mirrors more closely that of a typical seventeenth-century churchman than any the relatively secular critical climate of today might. I say this because the seventeenth-century reader was apt to be more sophisticated than we in the evocative possibilities of religious language simply because the prevailing Christian psychology of his day made it difficult for him not to be. If his contemporary literature is to be believed, he was perfectly comfortable with the "inherent 'duality'"1 of religious expressions and the corresponding duality of the states of mind to which they referred. He saw nothing quaint, novel nor puzzling, for example, in John Donne's commonplace remark that "a regenerate Chris- tian, being a new Creature , hath also a new facultie of Reason : and so believeth the Mysteries of Religion, out of another Reason, then as a meere natural man, he believeth natural and morali things."2 He was capable, as we often are not, of handling the oftentimes contradictory products of his "natural" and "right" (or "rectified") reasons without the kind of dismay that Waldock seems to display. Where Waldock sees only moral dilemma, he saw religious disclosure. The difference in logical orientation implied by the terms "right" and "natural" reason is a point I would like to dwell on for a moment because it lies close to the heart of my argument that Paradise Lost is an epic that was intended to be read by Christians familiar with the logical behavior of religious language. The most fundamental distinction one can point to between the right and natural reasons is that each establishes a position that it regards as "objective" by appeal to a quite different authority. 1 The term is Crystal's, Investigating English Style , p. 167. a The Sermons of John Donne, ed.

(Berkeley, 1953-62), III, sermon 17, lines 407-13.</page><page sequence="7">ť Paradise Losť 393 When the "natural" reasoner seeks "objectivity towards the Truth,"1 for example, he resorts ultimately to observable data which constitute his final court of appeal. The "right" reasoner, on the other hand, bases his "ob- jectivity towards the Truth" on the authority of God's decrees and edicts. Not only does the "right" reasoner place his faith upon the "evidence of things not seen, but, according to T. F. Torrance, in specifically religious matters his "appropriate act ... is to avoid using 'ordinary' objectivity."2 At least as far as matters of religious concern go, the "right" and the "natural" reasons cannot be said to be speaking the same language. Of course they share a superficial similarity of syntax and diction in their assertions, but the semantic and even logical configurations of the discourse of each are as distinct from one another as the authorities to which they look for "objectivity towards the Truth." To borrow Ludwig Wittgenstein's useful term we might say that the "right" and "natural" reasons function within the boundaries of different "language-games"3 in which what holds as confirming evidence according to the rules of one become heresy or nonsense according to the rules of the other. There can never be real debate between them, only confrontation, and it it such confrontations that Milton found so religiously useful in Paradise Lost. I would now like to turn to 1T. F. Torrance, "Faith and Philosophy," Hibbert Journal , XLVII (1949), 237. 2 Torrance distinguishes two notions of "objectivity" which bear heavily upon my analyses of the key apostasy situations in Paradise Lost. Against the inherent logical principles of "ordinary" objectivity, he poses a "true" objectivity which is "the capacity for the mind to be conformed to or behave appropriately before its object." Sometimes, Torrance notes, the object can be beyond the powers of ordinary categories of objectivity. Even then the mind must act appropriately toward it to be truly objective. Appropriate objectivity toward God, therefore, is an eschewal of "ordinary" objectivity for one more fitting to the circumstance, i.e., an "objectivity" which acknowledges as its norm the Word and will of God rather than empirical data. See Torrance, p. 273. 3 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (New York, 1953), pp. 2-33. Wittgenstein's precise meaning of "language-game" is variously interpreted. Its application here corresponds with Wilbur Urban's similar term, "uni- verses of discourse" ( Language and Reality [London, 1939]). Generally, we use the term to mean a language context, understanding that the objects and methods of one language- game are different from another. We "do not try to find out how much God eats for breakfast or how much he weighs" (Warren Shibles, Wittgenstein Language and Philosophy [Dubuque, la., 1969], p. 2.) Ultimately, the term "language-game" is logically dependent upon Wittgenstein's axiom that "the meaning of a word is its use in the language" (loc. cit., p. 20).</page><page sequence="8">394 THOMAS F. MERRILL two confrontations which Milton uses as religious models in the epic, which I hope will clearly illustrate the point. The first is the running debate between Abdiel and Satan in Books Five and Six; the second includes the quarrel between Adam and Eve just prior to her temptation and fall and Eve's ultimate temptation by Satan. The very names "Abdiel" (Servant of God) and "Satan" (Adversary) anticipate a situation where two rival "language-games" might approp- riately be brought into collision. This is precisely what Milton does. In a normal debate we generally adjudge one side the winner on the basis of appeal to a single set of authoritative criteria. In the Abdiel-Satan debates, however, we soon see that two sets of authoritative criteria are operative, both of which have considerable ethical and religious hold upon the Christian. Satan's speeches, for example, have a great deal to commend them from an ethical point of view. He argues, in fact, with an egalitarian fervor indistinguishable from Milton's own in the political pamphlets. Similarly, Abdiel's speeches reflect a commitment - a loyalty and devotion to God - with which few could find fault. The point is that each debater's position, considered independent of the other, reflects exemplary values. It is only when the two are juxtaposed in the framework of a formal debate that their mutual hostility becomes shockingly apparent and the potential religious insight within the situation is released. What, in fact, happens? Put as baldly as possible, Abdiel's "right" reason sponsors a language- game which is governed by a "logic of obedience,"1 that is, its fundamental premise, upon which all truth assertions are supported, is divine revelation. Accordingly, Satan's "natural" reason sponsors a language-game which is governed by a "logic of empiricism," that is, a logic which finds its truth datum in observable phenomena. Such opposing language-games possess only the appearance of mutual negotiability. In fact, there is no common ground between them. They are logically immiscible. The empirical cast of Satan's logic is clear from the passage he delivers just before Abdiel rises to challenge him: Who can in reason then or right assume Monarchy over such as live by right 1 The term is Frederick Ferré's ( Language , Logic , and God [New York, 1961], p. 81). Ferré goes on to point out, in the form of a summary of T. F. Torrance's posi- tion, that "rationality in theological matters does not oppose . . . but presupposes obedience . . (Ibid.).</page><page sequence="9">' Paradise Losť 395 His equals, if in power and splendor less, In freedom equal? or can introduce Law and Edict on us, who without law Err not? (v. 794-799) Satan's pose, of course, is one of dispassionate, objective inquiry, but the basis of his "objectivity" (not God's will but an autonomous natural prin- ciple) provokes unbelieving dismay in Abdiel. Satan has in effect reduced God to just another empirical item in the heavenly landscape and has made Him accountable to an exterior law which apparently confers "equal freedom" on all heavenly beings. Satan's newly acknowledged "God" is "things as they are." Scientific scepticism has been born. On Abdiel's part, Satan's words are as reasonable as a call for the repeal of the law of gravity. The logical anchorage of Abdiel's language is equally clear in his retort: Shalt thou give Law unto God, shalt thou dispute With him the points of liberty, who made Thee what thou art, and form'd the Pow'rs of Heav'n Such as he pleas'd, and circumscrib'd thir being? (v. 822-825) The subliminal logics of both statements really contend over the issue of what validates a truth-claim: what we see and deduce for ourselves, or what God tells us? The thrust of Abdiel's entire rebuttal to Satan is really no rebuttal at all but rather the attempt to re-establish the priorities that Satan's empiricism has overthrown. God, Abdiel can only repeat, is not beholden to any exterior law; He is the sine qua non. Satan reveals his empirical commitment even more blatantly when he challenges Abdiel's assertion that "by his Word the mighty Father made All things, ev'n thee, . . ." (v. 836-837). Unwilling to accept even this fun- damental dogma, Satan remains unconvinced without "the ocular proof": That we were form'd then say'st thou? and the work Of secondary hands, by task transferr'd From Father to his Son? strange point and new! . . . who saw When this creation was? remember's thou Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? (v. 853-858) Having asked the empirical question, Satan supplies his own empirical answer:</page><page sequence="10">396 THOMAS F. MERRILL We know no time when we were not as now; Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised By our own quick'ning power ... (v. 859-861) The pattern of Satan's regression from "right" to "natural" reason is rather ironically capsulized by Satan himself in Book Six where he recol- lects for us his "progress" from religious misconception to empirical "en- lightenment": At first I thought that liberty and Heav'n To heav'nly Souls had been all one; but now I see that most through sloth had rather serve, Minisťring Spirits, train'd up in Feast and Song. (vi. 164-167) Satan's fall to "enlightenment" is parallelled by a fall of language. Where "right" reason knows no double meanings to words, the advent of "natural" reasoning immediately ushers in legions of strange new connotations for old words. Where "service" originally meant the natural function of love, Satan now defines it as the inevitable consequence of sloth. Throughout Paradise Lost we discover Milton employing similar dualisms, persuading us that along with Satan's fall, diction falls too: "love" descends to "sloth," "obedience" stoops to "servility," 'freedom" drops to "slavery". The consistency of Satan's empirical language orientation is clear through- out the epic, and his characterization of the ensuing battle in heaven as a contention between the "servility" of the faithful angels and the 'freedom" of his own hordes is in perfect keeping here. Milton's determination to include Abdiel in the scene, however, is really what saves the hermeneutical potential of the situation, its religiously evocative power. Not Satan's argu- ment, not Abdiel' s argument, but the debate as a whole functions closely along the lines of what the philosopher Max Black calls a "memorable metaphor": one which "has the power to bring two separate domains into cognitive and emotional relation by using language directly appropriate to the one as a lens for seeing the other."1 The individual language-games of Abdiel and Satan are indeed "separate domains" which confront one another down to their semantic structures. The debate brings these con- flicting domains into "cognitive and emotional relation" by permitting key words to be shared. But the sharing is of a very special sort, for rather 1 Max Black, Models and Metaphors: Studies in Language and Philosophy (Ithaca, 1962), p. 237.</page><page sequence="11">c Paradise Losť 397 than initiating a detente between the two hostile domains, it maintains their logical immiscibility by forcing new denotations upon the key words. Just as God's "Golden Scepter" transmutes in Beelzebub's fallen mind to an "Iron Rod" (ii. 327-328), so the meanings of theologically sensitive words change when their context is shifted from a "logic of obe- dience" to a "logic of empiricism." The most volatile of the shared words in the debate is "freedom", and Milton cleverly balances the Christian sense of the word (". . . that whereby we are loosed . . .from the bondage of sin ... to the intent ... we may serve God in love . . ."1) against its quite distinct counterpart, "freedom" in the sense of one's liberty from constraints . One freedom is characterized by the positive thrust of "to" (freedom to "serve God in love"), while the other implies mere negative immunity (freedom from divine obligation). Predictably, the "freedom speeches" of Abdiel and Satan conflict like two poles of a paradox, and the significant feature of the debate, from the point of view of religious language, is that the resultant paradox is not resolved but forced to stand. The paradox encloses and protects the crucial mystery of the Christian faith against the blight of a demeaning literalism. Satan's understanding of freedom serves as a lens through which we gain intuitive insight into Abdiel's freedom. Because the debate makes secular non-sense, we are invited to adjust our orientation so that it will make sacred wisdom. We can do this, of course, only by supplanting our empirical objectivity with the logic of obedience. My claim, then, that the Abdiel-Satan debates not only say but do something to our orientation toward the event, is based upon the assump- tion that Milton's intention for including the episode was to create a char- acteristically religious situation capable of leading the sensitive Christian reader to a genuine religious discernment. He presents us with conflicting language systems based upon opposing logical premises and assumes that their clash will ignite the desired illuminating sparks within us. A more systematic and aggressive exploitation of this technique takes place in the separation scene in Book Nine in which Eve spiritedly challenges Adam for permission to divide their labors. Despite its charming domestic verisimilitude, many critics have discovered bothersome anomalies in 1 The Christian Doctrine , The Student's Milton , ed. Frank Allen Patterson, rev. ed. (New York, 1933), p. 1028.</page><page sequence="12">398 THOMAS F. MERRILL Milton's handling of the episode, all of which generally involve ethical propriety. John Peter, for example, wonders why Milton seems to make Adam so inept at parrying Eve's arguments. After noting that "every point [Eve] advances is lucid and persuasive - a fact which greatly enhances the demureness of her replies," he then contends that "Adam's rejoinders are deliberately made to seem inferior so that this advantage will remain with her."1 Peter sympathizes with Adam's embarrassed reluctance to admit that he feels "doubtful about her ability to stand alone," but he is forced to trace how this reluctance leads first to the suggestion that they should "avoid I Th'attempt itself, intended by our Foe" (ix. 294-295) and then to the embarrassingly silly argument that even a temptation that fails "asperses the tempted with dishonour foul" (ix. 296-297). Eve's rebuttal to this is devastating: "... his foul esteem / Sticks no dishonour on our Front, but turns I Foul on himself" (ix. 329-331). Peter also points out Adam's blun- der when he asks, "Why shouldst not thou . . . thy trial choose / With me, best witness of the Virtue tri'd' (ix. 315-317), not seeing, as she does, that the trial is then no trial at all." It is not necessary to belabor the point other than to grant Mr. Peter that Adam's ineptness here must have been deliberate on Milton's part. This is so manifestly true that we hardly balk at Peter's conclusion that Eve "holds the aces of reason" and Adam "the trumps of intuition."2 But what a curious anomaly! Why should Milton concoct a debate that has the effect of reversing a psychological pattern that the rest of the epic has worked so hard to promote? Must we sadly document a Miltonic blunder, or should we examine, perhaps, the validity of our chosen orientation toward the conversation? Fredson Bowers, to cite another instance, is disturbed by the abruptness with which Milton appears to have Adam "cave in" to Eve in this scene, after having apparently won his case with the formidable challenge: Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve First thy obedience, (ix. 367-368) "If he had stopped there," Bowers contends, "Eve could have had no answer, and we would still be innocent . . . After this firm assertion of his hierarchical duty to command and she to obey, he suddenly appears 1 John Peter, A Critique of Paradise Lost (New York and London, 1960), p. 118. 2 Ibid. pp. 118-19.</page><page sequence="13">' Paradise Losť 399 to cave in"1: "Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more" (ix. 372). In addition to the objections of Peter and Bowers we might add the question of the propriety of Eve's language in the quarrel. By almost any standard, her discourse in this episode is hardly consistent with her previous speeches. A minimum of scrutiny immediately reveals that she speaks an apostate language indistinguishable fron Satan's. Like Satan, for example, Eve bases her remarks upon a "sense of unjur'd merit" (i. 98). Miffed at what she interprets as a rebuke to her constancy, she begins a line of argument which, if we examine its logical substructure, is totally alien to all the principles of theological objectivity we have heretofore expected of her speeches. Her remarks cleave to the authority of an autonomous virtue rather than God's will. She presses a humanistically laudable (but theologically dubious) trial of ethical virtue. Like Satan's, her language presumes a self-sufficiency inappropriate to her status. Her "objectivity towards the Truth" has shifted unaccountably to an empirical base. Equally Satanic is the fact that her language discloses the first symptoms of semantic duality which we have seen to be a linguistic concomitant to apostasy. Most noticeably Eve assigns to the word 'freedom" a new meaning. Where before she habitually understood it to describe a state of loving obedience, now she demands 'freedom'" from the moral restraints of her lover. She speaks the proud, humanistic ethic of Areopagitica , clearly dis- avowing the "fugitive and cloistered virtue" which divine edict, up to this point, had prescribed as best for her. Eve's language-game, as we will see, is a linguistic novelty in Paradise. These three apparent anomalies in the separation scene - that Adam, even though he is highest in intellectual endowment, argues less effect- ively than Eve; that Adam does not seem to behave as the Lord of Creation by "caving in" to Eve; that Eve speaks like a fallen woman before her technical lapse - nourish the nagging suspicion, as they accumulate, that perhaps the problem was not Milton's but ours in not taking a proper orientation to what occurs theologically in the argument. It is quite possible - even probable - that our eyes have not been stage center. To take the second anomaly first, we must agree with Bowers that Adam seems to violate the rule of hierarchy by "caving in" to Eve but only so 1 Fredson Bowers, "Adam, Eve, and The Fall in Paradise Lost ," PMLA , LXXXIV, 2 (March, 1969), 270.</page><page sequence="14">400 THOMAS F. MERRILL long as we view the situation from the narrow and incomplete point of view of hierarchy alone. My position has consistently been that Paradise Lost has only marginal concern with patterns of ethics, hierarchies, and social mores, and that it merely exploits these patterns as models which point to higher religious realities. The separation scene is not solely based upon the principle of hierarchy despite what Bowers and G. S. Lewis 1 contend. The theological dimension of the scene includes at least such additional considerations as the principle of Christian liberty to which Adam, at this point in the epic, is beholden. Does "authority" in a prelapsarian world function the same as it does in a fallen world? Bowers insists that it does, but is it not true that Paradise Lost teaches throughout the opposite? Everywhere in the epic we are shown that the significance of obedience is that it is freely bestowed, not demanded. God Himself states the principle: Not free, what proof could they have giv'n sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where only what they needs must do, appear'd, Not what they would? (iii. 103-106) Following the logic of the parallelism of "Hee for God only, shee for God in him" (iv. 299), Eve's obedience to Adam must be equally dependent upon freedom as Adam's to God. For Adam to force Eve's will by making her stay, as Bowers recommends, would be to violate a fundamental prin- ciple of prelapsarian liberty. From a theological point of view, "Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more" (ix. 372) is not "bad doctrine" at all; it is the statement of a man whose hand has been forced by the very best of doctrines: Christian liberty. The other two anomalies respond just as rewardingly to a proper theo- logical perspective. Peter's impression of the argument, we remember, held Eve's to be the reasonable voice and Adam's the intuitional, an anomalous situation from any point of view. But suppose we seriously consider the logical similarity of Eve's and Satan's discourse and adopt a theological perspective toward the separation scene which recognizes its apostate con- figuration. Despite our "feelings" about the scene, which Peter no doubt accurately describes, we know that Eve is wrong in her intention to leave Adam and that Adam is right to want her to stay; yet, the structure and tone of the argument suggests the opposite: the "reasonable" course of 1 A Preface to Paradise Lost (New York, 1961), pp. 73-78.</page><page sequence="15">' Paradise Losť 401 action is apostasy; the "unreasonable," obedience. It is as if Milton were deliberately setting form and content at cross-purposes. The pattern should be familiar, for it is the same as Adam's dilemma and the same as the Satan-Abdiel debates. The resolution of the apparent problem should also be familiar, for it demands our acknowledgment that in the separation scene, as in all scenes of apostasy in Paradise Lost , two conflicting "language-games" are deliberately collocated for the purpose of wrenching us from our two-dimensional ethical posture into a three- dimensional theological perspective which provides the kind of religious insight otherwise unattainable. Let us see how these conflicting language- games are exploited specifically in Adam and Eve's quarrel. Assuming Eve's language to be apostate in structure we might expect that, like Satan's most persuasive speeches, it will follow "natural" instead of "right" reason - that it should cleave to an empirical objectivity. Simi- larly, we would expect Adam's language to reflect an objectivity toward the truth which holds as its authority obedience to God. To appreciate the logical conflict that these linguistic commitments involve, we should bear in mind Torrance's axioms that "rationality in theological matters does not oppose . . . but presupposes obedience" and that "the appropriate act" in theological matters" is to avoid using 'ordinary' objectivity." Seen in this light, the separation scene may perhaps yield fewer "ethical" incon- sistencies than supposed and may reveal the reason why Milton was deter- mined to have Eve "appear" the more engaging in the quarrel. In short, Peter's feeling that Eve speaks reason and Adam intuition and that although "both are right . . . Adam is righter because events will prove him so," may not be "paradoxical" in quite the way he thinks. It may be the case that Adam's speeches only seem to be based on intuition because their logical authority is not empirical. If this is true, what we are considering is a semantic rebellion on Eve's part which prepares and foreshadows a more credible temptation and fall than otherwise might have been possible if her language had not been permitted to lapse in advance. As it is, she meets Satan on an argumentative level that is common to both. Their objectivity towards the Truth is thoroughly empirical.1 1 In a very significant way the quarrel of Adam and Eve parallels that of Chaucer's Chanticleer and Pertelote. Chanticleer's logical authority (his premonitory dream of disaster) is finally overturned by the force of Pertelote's empirical and practical rebuttal: Certes, this dreem, which ye han met to-nyght, 6</page><page sequence="16">402 THOMAS F. MERRILL The pattern is set from the very beginning of the argument when Eve looks about the garden and observes to Adam that "the work under our labor grows, / Luxurious by restraint; what we by day / Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, / One night or two with wanton growth derides I Tending to wild" (IX, 208-212). There should be no question about the accuracy of her observation since Milton, only a few lines before, has clearly told us that the "work outgrew / The hands' dispatch of two Gard'ning so wide." Eve's empirical observation leads immediately to her pragmatic recommendation : Let us divide our labors, thou where choice Leads thee, or where most needs . . . while I In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon. (ix. 214-19) and the recommendation is supported by empirical evidence of a psycho- logical nature: For while so near each other thus all day Our task we choose, what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles, or object new Casual discourse draw on, which intermits Our day's work brought to little, though begun Early, and th'hour of Supper comes unearn'd. (ix. 220-25) Not only does Eve display a new "knowingness" in this speech, which sug- gests some progress on the way from innocence to experience, but the practical ordering of her priorities introduces a note into Paradise which we today identify as the "Protestant work ethic." No sin has been com- Comth of the greete superfluytee Of youre rede colera, pardee, Which causeth folk to dreden in hir dremes O arwes, and of fyr with rede lemes . . . Eve, like Pertelote, finds her objectivity towards the Truth from the examination of the things around her, and Adam, like Chanticleer, takes his from a revelation (The Nun's Priest's Tale, The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer , ed. F. N. Robinson, 2nd. ed. (Boston, 1957), p. 200 (VII, 2926-2930).</page><page sequence="17">6 Paradise Lost ' 403 mitted; Eve's innocence has in no way been overtly compromised, but her language, because of its empirical orientation, establishes the inevitability of things to come. Adam is confused by the new orientation of Eve's discourse and this perhaps accounts for some of his clumsiness in dealing with it. He begins by praising her practicality, however patronizingly (It is good that women "study household good" [ix. 233] and try to promote "good works in her Husband" [ix. 234], but the theological objectivity of his stance requires him almost immediately to set about restoring a similar theological objec- tivity in Eve's thinking: Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd Labor, as to debar us when we need Refreshment . . . For not to irksome toil, but to delight He made us, and delight to Reason join'd. (ix. 235-43) God's will, not the unruly luxuriance of Eden, should dictate human con- duct, Adam feels. His theological objectivity confronts and supplants Eve's empirical objectivity. At this point the issue in Adam's mind is not sepa- ration itself, but the motive for it. He sees a perilous significance in the fact that Eve is employing as her authority for objectivity an apparent empirical necessity: the garden needs more pruning. This is why he is willing to allow Eve to go off by herself provided her motive is not horti- cultural necessity: But if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield. (ix. 248-49) Under these conditions Eve's departure would not violate Adam's logic of obedience and he can freely give his consent. The danger of Satan's imminence, however, is another consideration and, as we search Adam's speeches for theological objectivity toward this threat, we are rewarded with lines which unfortunately cause us to wince at their patronizing, unheroic tone: The Wife, where danger of dishonor lurks, Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays, Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. (ix. 267-69)</page><page sequence="18">404 THOMAS F. MERRILL The rules of this language-game are much more arbitrary and much less appealing than those which we will see to govern Eve's. Nevertheless, they are the only appropriate rules for Edenic discourse. This is the text against which theological objectivity measures all things. The text for empirical objectivity, as Eve's and Satan's speeches abundantly show, can be found on any page of Areopagilica. What about the "unkindness" that Eve allegedly meets in Adam's ini- tial reply to her suggestion? Does it really exist, or is Eve, like Beelzebub and Satan, looking at a golden scepter and perceiving one of iron? There is no question that Eve's speeches, like Satan's, reflect a sense "of injur'd merit." The "firmness" of her "Faith and Love," she feels, has been put in question by Adam's alleged implication that it can be "shak'n or seduc't" (ix. 257). But if we carefully examine Adam's speeches up to this point, we discover no such implication at all. To the contrary, he merely expresses the strong probability that Satan Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage, us asunder, Hopeless to circumvent us join'd, where each To other speedy aid might lend at need. (ix. 257-60) Adam's emphasis is upon the mutual strength they share together and the mutual vulnerability they would risk apart. The only conceivable source for Eve's "injur'd merit" would seem to be Adam's articulation of the doctrine that the "Wife . . . Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays," and this Adam is duty-bound to recite in accordance with the logic of obedience. Eve clearly plays a new language-game, and if the rules of that game produce sentiments and principles to which we respond because, to use Peter's words, of their "quiet good sense," it is only because we share the very same rules; our authority for objectivity is empirical fact too. When Eve stands up to her husband and retorts: And what is Faith, Love, Virtue, unassay'd Alone, without exterior help sustain'd? (ix. 335-6) our humanistic sensibilities respond. We think of the rolling phrases from Areopagitica:</page><page sequence="19">'Paradise Losť 405 I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for ... 1 but fail, perhaps, to consider the authority for our objectivity as we applaud. Patiently, almost doggedly, Adam replies to Eve's harangues with: "O Woman, best are all things as the will / Of God ordain'd them" (ix. 343-44) and "Seek not temptation . . . Trial will come onsought. / Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve / First thy obedience" (ix. 364-68). This is the litany of obedience. Its objectivity is divine. Its reason is "right." Adam's awkwardness in the separation scene is largely the result of Milton's strategy to force immiscible language-games into collision. Adam's apparent argumentative ineptitude is mostly just that - apparent. The claims of right reason and the claims of natural reason are given their day on the field to battle it out with one another. Nevertheless, it is difficult to suppress the strong suspicion that even though Milton's Adam is rhetorically ham- pered by the logic of obedience which controls his speeches, depriving them of the winsomeness of a more humanistically oriented discourse, nev- ertheless, he could have done better than he did. Peter's feeling that "Adam's rejoinders are deliberately made to seem inferior"2 is well taken. Why did Milton give the advantage to Eve? The answer to this nagging question is perhaps lodged in a pattern we have discovered as consistent in all the apostasy situations in Paradise Lost - a pattern in which deeply-felt ethical convictions of human beings are deliberately juxtaposed against theological principles which contradict them. Adam's dilemma between principles of chivalry and divine obli- gation, Satan's heroic manifestoes in favor of civil liberty, Eve's confident uncloistered virtue versus Adam's cautious obedience, all these conflicts seem designed to shock readers out of their secular, ethical complacencies into a realization that religious obedience, as Milton defines it in de Doctrina , "is that virtue whereby we propose to ourselves the will of God as the paramount rule of our conduct, and serve him alone" [Italics mine].3 But there is another reason why Milton may have found it to his advan- 1 Areopagitica , The Student's Milton , ed.

MERRILL tage to make Eve's side of the quarrel seem the more attractive of the two for his readers. A linguistically and ethically obedient Eve would, like the Lady in Comus , be "clad in compleat steel." Eve's linguistic chastity would more than justify the Lady's confident challenge to Comus: "Fool do not boast. Thou canst not touch the freedom of my minde" (Comus, 662-3). Milton was at pains to create circumstances whereby Satan could touch the freedom of Eve's mind, but as long as she was firmly anchored to a logic of obedience this would be impossible. A linguistically chaste Eve might conceivably be bewildered by Satan's blandishments (having never heard such strange logic in Paradise before) just as Adam was ap- parently bewildered by hers, but, committed to disparate language-games, she and Satan could hardly be expected to affect one another persuasively. No common objectivity toward the Truth brings their dialogue into con- sonance. To put it bluntly, Milton calculated for Eve a linguistic fall prior to her actual one. It was an absolutely necessary contrivance in order to preserve the credibility of the scene under the tree, but it is a contrivance that is brilliantly and subtly camouflaged by Eve's overwhelmingly at- tractive humanism. As we hear her enthusiastically suing for her rights as a free individual, with all the rhetorical competence that the consum- mately experienced Milton can give her, we can hardly be expected to maintain in our minds simultaneously that she is nevertheless dead wrong. The very basis of her appeal for us - her self-confidence - is precisely what makes her vulnerable to Satan's tempting. Even before they meet under the tree, Eve and Satan have reached an understanding. God's arbitrary decree is no longer for either tempter nor tempted the authority for objectiv- ity toward the Truth; the new authority hangs on a branch above their heads. Proof that Eve's language has switched from theological to empirical objectivity can be had simply by comparing her speeches before and after the quarrel with Adam. How different Eve seems even as late as Book Eight when she retires from the conversation with Adam and Raphael because "her husband the Relater she preferr'd / Before the Angel, and of him to ask / Chose rather" (viii. 52-54). But perhaps even more telling than this example of obedient, willing capitulation to hierachy is the con- trast between Eve's attitudes toward Eden's plenty in Book Five, where earth's hallow'd mould, Of God inspir'd . . .</page><page sequence="21">' Paradise Losť 407 shall confess that here on Earth God hath dispensi his bounties as in Heav'n (v. 321-30) and Book Nine, where, as we have seen, the divine gift of plenitude has subtly changed to an obligation : . . . the work under our labor grows, Luxurious by restraint; what we by day Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wild. (ix. 208-12) Prior to the quarrel, Eve's language consistently corresponded with an appropriate theological objectivity usually manifesting itself in a relentless subordination of empirical evidence to the higher authority of God's de- crees (generally transmitted to her through Adam). Indeed, Eve's first speech in the epic makes this abundantly clear: O thou for whom And from whom I was form'd flesh of thy flesh, And without whom am to no end, my Guide And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. (iv. 440-43) Eve appears almost to revel in submission when she goes on to admit that she enjoys So far the happier Lot, enjoying thee Preeminent by so much odds, while thou Like consort to thyself canst nowhere find. (iv. 445-48) This is clearly not the same girl who chafes in Book Nine at her "Guide / And Head '[s]" conviction that "The Wife . . . Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays." Something has happened to her orientation toward Truth and, consequently, her status. It is a literal and thoroughly empirical Eve, then, who talks with Satan under the tree - an Eve highly impressionable to evidence of the senses. Her first words, in fact, express amazement at an empirical anomaly: What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? (ix. 553-554)</page><page sequence="22">408 THOMAS F. MERRILL In the succeeding two lines Milton leads Eve to create an unmistakable conflict between theological and empirical authorities: The first at least of these I thought deni'd To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day Created mute to all articulate sound. (ix. 555-57) Eve has been confronted with a test: Will she choose appearances as a guide to her understanding, or divine decrees and instructions? With Baco- nian élan she seeks an empirical explanation: Redouble then this miracle, and say, How cam'st thou speakable of mute , . . . (ix. 562-63) This, of course, provides the opportunity for Satan to expound upon the magical properties of the Tree of Knowledge, a view toward the tree against which Basil Willey properly cautions.1 Eve still maintains a certain healthy scepticism, but following an empir- ical lead, asks to be shown the evidence: "But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?" (ix. 617) As soon as she recognizes which tree it is, Eve's empirical orientation is momentarily challenged by the theological: Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess . . . But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch: God so commanded, and left that Command Sole Daughter of his Voice . . . (ix. 647-53) The issue is once again before us: which ought to have the higher claim upon us, obedience or appearances - faith or reason? But in spite of Eve's promising recognition and acknowledgment of the tree and its prohibition, and despite Milton's insistent interjection that Eve is "yet sinless" (ix. 659), it is quite evident that her demonstrated predilection for empirical rather than theological confirmation renders the persuasiveness of Satan's pro- positions and demonstrations irresistible. Satan invokes the tree as the "Mother of Science" and acknowledges 1 See The Seventeenth Century Background (New York, 1953), p. 245.</page><page sequence="23">4 Paradise Losť 409 its power "not only to discern / Things in thir Causes, but to trace the ways of highest Agents" (ix. 680-83). In Satan's mind, of course, the reversal of the priorities between natural reason and right reason is complete. The "Mother of Science" empowers him to comprehend existence as a vast, traceable network of cause-and-effect relationships. As a matter of fact, this empirical posture permits him to subordinate the "ways of highest Agents" to scientific explanation! Against Eve's objection that the tree has been interdicted and that the consequence of death awaits disobedience, Satan bluntly replies, ". . . do not believe / Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die" (ix. 684-85). For confirmation, he points to himself: look on mee, Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, And life more perfet have attain'd than Fate Meant mee, by vent'ring higher than my Lot. (ix. 687-90) Eve is the opposite of the Paduan professor Basil Willey describes, who "refused to look through Galileo's telescope" because he wished to avoid a collision between metaphysical truth and empirical fact.1 She is predis- posed to pick up the "telescope" Satan proffers and assess the situation with impeccable scientific methodology: Great are thy Virtues, doubtless, best of Fruits, Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admired, Whose taste, too long forborne, at first assay Gave elocution to the mute, and taught The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise. (ix. 745-49) Theological "conclusions" are arrived at through empirical methods: the fruit is "worthy to be admired" and has been "kept from Man." While the apple is certainly a fine one, and while God has indeed "kept" the Mankind from eating it, the context within which these assertations are made -an empirical cause-and-effect one - makes the implications tyrannical and sinister. Even the theologically respectable concept of covenant is perversely tainted by the empirical context in which it is placed. Eve argues: 1 Ibid., p. 29.</page><page sequence="24">410 THOMAS F. MERRILL In plain then, what forbids he but to know, Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? Such prohibitions bind not. (ix. 758-60) An empirical rather than a theological "good" dictates the breach of con- tract here, and the echo in these lines of The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates should once again call to our minds the absurdity of applying ethics ap- propriate to men to God. But this is precisely what Satan does, and Eve literally falls for it. Why? Because Eve has been made a literalist. Her empirically oriented mind has been tricked by a fraudulent, hypocritical and erroneous premise: that the serpent who speaks to her under the three really is a serpent! Eve's blindness, regrettably, is too often our blindness when we read religious works such as Paradise Lost . An ambivalent attitude toward the function of most religious texts keeps us from experiencing evocations of truly religious mystery which anthropomorphic models normally are in- tended to initiate. We settle for the penultimate achievement of the artist - the model itself - rather than opening our sensibilities to that toward which the model points. The price we pay for this semantic idolatry is that sooner or later the loose threads, the inconsistencies, the breaches of decorum and the annoying conundrums that works such as Paradise Lost yield when they are not read theologically, accumulate to the point where we can no longer responsibly blame Milton for them. At that time we may, hopefully, entertain the possibility that we do not know how to read God-talk as rewardingly as we might, and we might even be goaded into trying to learn.
