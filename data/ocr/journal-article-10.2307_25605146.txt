Scarborough University of Texas The native American rubber ball game played on a clay or masonry court was a well-defined institution in Middle America. Kirchoff's 1943 listing of traits defining Mesoamerica makes clear reference to this game. As much as any other prehispanic architectural or artifactual accomplishment, the form and function of the ball court allows comparison of past societies through one comparable analytical unit. With Ricardo Alegria's book, a major piece of what can be considered Greater Mesoamerica has now been set in place. Alegria's monograph carefully describes the location, architecture, and artif actual association for over a hundred bateys or ball game plazas in the Greater Antilles and Virgin Islands. Two introductory chapters review the wealth of ethnohistoric material indicating that the game was played by the Taino Indians on large courts of packed earth, with 20-30 players on a team. The solid rubber ball was acquired locally and volleyed without the use of hands. Chroniclers suggest that spirited wagering and the sacrifice of a human captive sometimes accompanied this event. Following the introduction, the next five chapters constitute the core of the book and reflect Alegria's collection and reexamination of ball court data since 1949. These chapters are a compendium of archeological site data organized by island group. Cuba, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico provide the vast majority of information, and Puerto Rico alone is responsible for 79</page><page sequence="2">COMPTES RENDUS/BOOK REVIEWS 87 accounts. Quadrangular and elliptical courts have been identified, while oval courts were perhaps less suited for the game and better adapted to ceremonial activities such as in areytos or dances. Quadrangular courts are the most numerous, and are sometimes enormous. The largest quadrangular court at Pueblo Viejo, Cuba measures 250 meters by 135 meters, and is reported to have an earthen side wall three meters in height. Courts in Puerto Rico are generally smaller than on the other two islands, but their parallel embankments are usually faced by stone slabs. At the important site of Caguana in Puerto Rico, where ten courts have been identified, elongated upright stones rise 2.7 meters above the ground. Many of these sites are associated with sidewalks or pavements which sometimes link a court with a stream in immediate proximity. Ball courts are associated with petroglyphs, and some of the best anthropomorphs in the Antilles are depicted at Plaza A at Caguana. Dateable ceramics from the few well-excavated courts are sparse. Alegria suggests that the earliest courts date to the seventh century, with the game enjoying increased popularity until the conquest. The final chapters of this book examine the ball game in a broad regional context and review the literature from South America, Mesoamerica, and the American Southwest. Little that is new is found in this synthesis, and the chapter on the American Southwest is less thorough than the others. After Stern (1948), a South American origin for the game is presented. Alegria takes a conservative stand in the manipulation of collected data. Although an attempt is made to compare court size with geographic area in Puerto Rico, no clear interpretation of these data follows. We might ask: How do sites without ball courts differ from those with ball courts? What is the relationship between mountain sites and coastal communities? We are told that sugar cane activities have destroyed coastal sites in Puerto Rico, but many coastal sites in Cuba are reported. Political organization is seldom alluded to, and the anthropomorphic petroglyphs might provide a key. By Late Formative times at Monte Alban, Oaxaca, Mexico, petroglyphs suggest a confederation of local chiefdoms and the glorification of human sacrifice. Clearly there are differences between sites, but a site as complex as Caguana in Puerto Rico warrants greater interpretive insight. Alegria has provided a well-written and thorough compilation of the ball game in the Antilles. Although this study lacks broad interpretive statements about the effect of the ball game on political and economic life, Alegria's work is careful and will be a major reference for both the Antilles and any examination of the native American ball game.</page><page sequence="3">88 ANTHROPOLOGICA N.S. 26(1) 1984 REFERENCES CITED Kirchoff, Paul 1943 Mesoamerica.
