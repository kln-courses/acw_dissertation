Voyageur Press, Inc., 144 pp. Hard- back: $29.95. ;= Resembling inquisitive, over- sized, short-tailed shaggy white rats but magnified to a huger scale and specially fitted with coal black noses, the photographs of the great white bears of the Arctic are mesmerizing. Concerned with the wel- fare of polar bears, this book is part of a wildlife nature series designed to deliver information to the public about conservation issues. For this task, Ni- kita Ovsyanikov, a Russian biologist and behaviorist, has put together an extremely attractive pictorial collection with a very readable text describing his encounters with polar bears. The polar bear, Ursus martimus, is the largest land carnivore in the world. Armed only with a big stick and forti- fied by his perceived dominant person- ality, the author spent eight seasons observing and interacting with the po- lar bears on two Arctic islands in the Chukchi Sea, north of Siberia. Essen- tially the author concentrated on three areas of study, (1) the social life of polar bears, (2) the way polar bears interact with their prey, and (3) the behavior of mother bears in their se- cluded denning areas. The polar bear family is described as a maternal social unit that is usually made up of a mother and her one, two or three cubs. While seals are considered the main prey for polar bears, walruses were so plentiful on the islands studied that the land encounters of these two giants are described in bloody detail. Currently the hostile icy waters preclude obser- vations on the nature of aquatic pred- ator-prey events. While the polar bear is noteworthy for its snowy hued coat, the f -ur is not actually white. Lacking pigments, the transparent hairs with their hollow structure function as solar collectors. Since the pigmentless fur reflects light, it appears white to us. The bear's skin color, exposed at the nose, is actually black and absorbs the heat. The fur In a world full of copycats......

Polar bears are very inquisitive, and the author relates several startling encounters when the animals hovered outside his cabin looking through the window or sniffing at the door. Still the bears be- haved quite 'civilized' as they main- tained their manners and did not force themselves on the human company. In the Bering Sea area, a healthy mature adult male can weigh over a thousand pounds, and one paw swipe can kill a full-grown seal. This Arctic carnivore is generally viewed as an aggressive and dangerous creature that is a threat to people found within its range. Trying to interact with the bears as one animal to another, and without carrying arms except for a big stick, the author decided to act as though he were a bear of the highest social rank. In order to assume such behavior, he had to carefully observe their ranking within their own groups and mimic the poses viewed. As he says, "It is possi- ble to walk among the bears if you have to. You just need to have steady nerves and an intimate knowledge of the rules that govern their social behav- ior." The book, Polar Bears, provides a popular account of these animals. As such it is written in a simple style that can be termed anthropomorphic to en- gage the readers' emotions. This is def- initely not a professional scientific tract directed toward the specialist. Instead it is a very attractively composed med- ley of superb photographs of Arctic denizens within their icy setting which is linked to very elementary and de- scriptive prose that simply outlines the work of an animal behaviorist studying polar bears. The author intends to show that the polar bear is not a threat to man; unfortunately it is man who has wantonly hunted and murdered this magnificent creature. A casual browser cannot help but be captivated by the illustrations that will lead to a reading of the text to expand the content of the photographs. Like the various popular nature series shown on the media, this photographic atlas will entrance the reader at all levels. It is a wonderful introduction to animal behavior for grade schoolers. Junior and senior high school students will view the behavioral sciences as an avenue for further exploration that can lead to better understanding, and the contents will convince readers that there is much still to know about the animals we share this world with. This is a book for family, schools and librar- ies. R.
