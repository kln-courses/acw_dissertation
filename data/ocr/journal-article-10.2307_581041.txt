<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1967-68 ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 Despite some forward-looking developments, such as the highly promising investigation of remains in Thera buried by the eruption c. 1500 B.c. and the resumption of excavations at Tiryns and Knossos, it has been a critical year for archaeology in Greece. On account of land acquisition difficulties, it was for long uncertain whether the munificent sub- vention from the Ford Foundation announced in 1966 would secure re-opening of the American excavations in the Athenian Agora. Happily the Greek Government has now initiated expropriation of a substantial area north of the railway. The Greek Archaeological Service, already hard-pressed by rapid expansion of its responsibilities, has been further handicapped since the removal of its Director- General and five of his most senior colleagues. The demands of economy, on the other hand, have trimmed its budget and removed virtually the entire force of some 70 'scientific assistants', the university graduates who were doing valuable work both in museums and in the field. Professor S. Marinatos, who had been head of the Service until 1958, was recalled to take charge. He has done so with characteristic energy, but is reported to have con- fessed that the Service in its present decline cannot respond as it should to its scientific and national vocation (Eleftheros Kosmos 21/v/I968). One of his first decisions was to invite the Foreign Schools to participate in the identification and excavation of archaeological sites to be submerged on completion of the Peneios Barrage in Elis, in addition to their normal concessions elsewhere. In respect of the work of Greek archaeologists these reviews are largely dependent on the voluminous Chronika (Chr) sections of Archaiologikon Deltion (ADelt). These have fallen further into arrear. Since the publication of volume 20 covering work of the year 1964, only the 'Studies' sections (Mel) of 21 and 22 have been issued. But through the kindness of Mrs A. Kaloyeropoulou I have been able to peruse proofs of the first section of reports covering 1965. I am also in her debt for the loan of photographs and for permission to re-publish them. To meet the need for prompt announcement of important discoveries, Professor Marinatos has founded a new official periodical Athens Annals of Archaeology (AAA), of which the first of three numbers planned for 1968 has appeared. By its short accounts of recent excavations and chance discoveries (when in Greek there are summaries in another language) this has instituted for the activities of the Service the prompt reporting which Professor A. Orlandos has long provided for the work of the Archaeological Society. His Ergon for 1967 has been much used in this review (A.S.) and for a number of the illustrations I am again in his debt. I have also to thank other contributors for informa- tion and photographs: the heads of other Foreign Schools and those who directed their excavations; Professor A. Cambitoglou for a report on his ex- cavations in Andros; all those who have sent their publications; and, finally, those who reported on their excavations for the British School at Knossos and Myrtos in Crete, and at Asprochaliko and Kastritsa in Epirus. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. When the new director Dr V. Kallipolitis took charge in 1967, the arrangement of the public galleries undertaken by the late Chr. Karouzos and Mrs S. Karouzou had been virtually completed in 40 rooms, including three containing relief sculpture to be opened in 1968, out of a total of 51. The remaining rooms are destined for the bronzes of the Classical and later periods, terracotta figurines, portraits and other sculpture of the Roman period (3 rooms), the Egyptian Collection (3 rooms) and the jewellery other than the Eleni Stathatou Collection already displayed. The Cretan origin and LM IIIB date of three gabled larnakes deposited in the Museum in 1967 has been established by Mrs E. Touloupa (AAA I, 54 ff). In their form, size and naturalistic or abstract decoration (Fig. x) they are closer to those FoIG. I</page><page sequence="2">4 A. H. S.

Karouzou's Collection of Sculpture, a catalogue of the exhibited pieces with 62 plates, has appeared in Greek (1967) and English (1968) editions. Kal- lipolitis reports the identification by J. Frel of the top of a tomb relief found in 1964 near the junction of Aeolus and Lycurgus Streets as the upper part of no. 1822, which has been connected with the figures on the Nike balustrade attributed to Callimachos (AAA I, 85 fr.).

Peppa-Delmouzou, has published a short history of the collection together with a full account of its reorganisation in enlarged premises under her predecessor M. Mitsos (AE 1966, 201 ff.). lished in the Museum on a regular basis in 1965, apart from work carried out on the premises (from Kythera alone 150 icons arrived for attention), has undertaken the restoration of the apse mosaic in Hosios David in Thessaloniki, the partial cleaning of the twelfth century dome fresco of the enthroned Pantocrator in the Monastery of St Hierotheos near Megara, which deserves to be better known, work on the frescoes in many churches in Kythera, Crete and elsewhere, as well as the relaying of extensive floor mosaics, notably in Thessaloniki. The most exacting task, however, arose from the impending disappearance of the Episkopi church in Evrytania in the waters of the lake formed by the Acheloos Barrage. The remains of several successive fresco decorations discovered under later plaster, the earliest of aniconic character and possibly as early as the ninth century (visible in a gap of the figural decoration in Fig. 2), about 240 square metres in all, were removed layer by layer and taken to Athens (ADelt 21 Chr 16 ff.). Acropolis. A sculpture fragment used as building material in the Church of the Metamorphosis on the north slope, which was removed during repairs in 1965, has been assigned by Miss Ch. Koukouli to the frieze of the north porch of the Erechtheum. The lower part of a seated mother with a young girl partly supported on her left knee, it invites identi- fication with the group by lasos of Kollytos listed after the departing warrior in the building inscriptions (ADelt 22 Mel 133 ff.). Acropolis Slopes. Removal of dumps in the area outside the Beul6 Gate, as part of the programme of rehabilitation carried out by Miss A. Solomou under the direction of N. Platon, led (in 1965) to the discovery of a 'well' cut in the rock to a depth of 4 - I m. and containing a pure Sub-Neolithic fill. Four complete vases were found and restorable fragments of eight others (Fig. 3): a polished mono- FIG. 2 The Numismatic Collection is now autonomous, though housed in the National Museum as before.

Chatzidakis include a marble closure panel transferred from the National Museum which is a notable example of the tenth-eleventh century type with orientalising animal subjects in rather high relief, in this case two confronted sphinxes pouncing on a hare at the foot of a central 'sacred tree'.

Agora. Leslie Shear Jr reports that further investigation of the sanctuary at the southwest corner, of which a boundary stone had been found in situ (AR 1966-67 4, fig. 3), has revealed it as a small triangular temenos, probably an abaton. Associated pottery dates it to the last third of the fifth century B.C. Just east of it, a cremation burial of a woman was found in an exceptionally fine amphora of about 850 B.C. With the ashes was a considerable collection of jewellery, including a pair of heavy gold earrings decorated with both filigree and granulation and each ending in three pendant pomegranates (Fig. 5). There were seven other complete Geo- metric vases and a terracotta model of a wooden chest on legs. Affixed to the lid of the chest are five miniature granaries of conical form (Fig. 6). The early road leading into the Agora from the junction at the triangular temenos was examined in a test under the west end of the Middle Stoa. Its use can be traced back to the eighth century. At a point where a sidestreet came in from the west a marble boundary stone was found in situ, inscribed in letters of about 500 B.c. horos eimi tes agoras. Two more early monuments were further FIG. 6 investigated. South Stoa I was shown to have provided office and dining quarters for some of the many administrative boards which comprised the Athenian civil service. The Peribolos of the Eponymous Heroes is now seen to have been constructed initially in the mid-fourth century B.c. FIG. 5 Roman Agora. Clearance and some new excavation carried out by Miss E. Zaganiari (in 1965) under the direction of N. Platon has clarified the plan at the southwest corner (ADelt 21 Chr 44 ff.). A notable find was a substantial new fragment of the casualty list which Bradeen has related to Thrasyllos's Ionian expedition of 409 B.C. (Hesperia 33, 53 ff.). It precedes and joins fragment I found in the American School's Agora excavation of 1938 (Hesperia 12, 39). The Periphery. A section of the city wall of the Classical period was exposed (in 1965) in excavations prior to new building at Erysichthonos 15. This lies immediately north of the gate identified by Threpsiades as the Peiraikai Pylai (PAE 1953, 63 ff-). Miss B. Philippaki reports that the greater part of this section is a reconstruction of the fourth century</page><page sequence="4">6 A. H. S. MEGAW B.c., on which the remains of one ofJustinian's towers abuts; also that, outside it, the proteichisma and ditch were also found, for the first time in this western sector. Of the southeastern rampart also a new section came to light during the laying of telephone cables in losiph Rogon Street, where work attri- butable to Conon's reconstruction could be dis- tinguished from that ofthe time of Lycurgus (ADelt 21 Chr 55 ff., 65 ff). Outstanding among many recent discoveries in the cemeteries were the graves found in an area close to the Kerameikos during the cutting of a trench for a sewer in Kriezi Street. Miss O. Alexandri reports (AAA I, 20 ff.) that the earliest of the burials was a Sub- Mycenaean cist-grave with a small stirrup-jar and five other vases. There were nine crema- tions in amphorae rang- ing from the tenth century (as Kerameikos V i pl. 25 no. 2132) to the early seventh, the latest with a graffito: MNE. The Suburbs. M. Mitsos has drawn attention to the location of a previously unknown sanctuary of Akamas by the discovery (in 1965 in Kallithea) of fragments of a stele which was to be set up there. It preserves parts of two decrees of the Akamantis tribe dated 361/60 (ADelt 21 Chr I5). FIG. 7 P. Lazarides reports a major discovery in September 1967, in spoil taken from various building sites to fill a clay-pit at Ayios Ioannis Rendis. This is an early Archaic kore, somewhat under life-size, headless but with tresses in the Daidalic style and with the arms positioned as in the Auxerre statue (Fig. 7). Lazarides places it before the Hera of Samos, with which it shares the flaring hem of the chiton (AAA I, 34). The statue is at present in the Piraeus Museum. The Long Walls. A short section of the 'middle wall' was discovered (in 1965) on the site of the 'Elais' factory at New Phaleron (on Karaoli Dimitriou Street) and part of it remains exposed beneath the new building. The width is 390 m. Part of a tower projecting 4"90 m. was also found and a roughly corresponding projection of I .40 m. on the inside of the wall. E. Koumroglou assigns the top course found to Conon's repairs and the rest to the original construction of 445 B.C. (ADelt 21 Chr 92 ff.). Thorikos. The third (1965) campaign of the Greek-Belgian excavations under the joint direction of the late M. Verdelis and H. Mussche broke new ground on the east slope of Mt Velatouri, where an evidently isolated building of the Sub-Geometric period was found. This includes a series of small rooms grouped round a larger one opening south- wards onto a kind of court. The pottery indicates construction at the very end of the eighth century and occupation until the mid-seventh only. West of this a MH house was found, with two child burials below the earlier of its two floors. On the later floor, grey Minyan and matt-painted sherds were associated with considerable quantities of lead, slag and litharge, indicating that the extraction of silver from silver-bearing lead was practised here at an unexpectedly early date. More of the metal-working establishment of the Geometric period in the area of the west cemetery was uncovered. The industrial quarter of the classical period was also further examined. At the west end the foundation of a circular tower some 7'5 m. in diameter was exposed, which, to judge by two such cited by J. H. Young (Hesperia 25, 122), was probably used for some agricultural purpose (ADelt 21 Chr 105 ff. and Thorikos iii 1965 [Brussels, 1968]). Myrrhinous. D. Lazarides reports new excavations (1967-68) in the Geometric cemetery (see BCH 85, 626 ff.). Despite much damage by deep ploughing, some of the new graves were intact and richly furnished with vases of ripe Geometric style. Beside one grave were fragments of a large crater of the Dipylon style with prothesis scene, chariot zones and ships below the double handles (AAA I, 31 ff.). Brauron. The attention which the late I. Papa- dimitriou's discoveries focused on the Sanctuary of Artemis is bearing fruit. The museum erected nearby is destined both to house the finds from the excavations and to be a repository for discoveries throughout the Mesogeia. Miss B. Philippaki has been engaged on its arrangement. The account by C. Bouras of the restoration of the H-shaped stoal is the first detailed study of the architecture of this late fifth century building, the first stoa of this form, though it was never completed. Reviewing the cult of Artemis Brauronia in the light of the excavation of the sanctuary, I. Kondis suggests that the erection of the stoa and its other principal buildings by the city of Athens, may be regarded as part of the reaction to the iconoclastic movement which cul- minated in the mutilation of the Herms in 415- He also suggests a connexion with the rehabilitation of Iphigenia, to whom the stoa was dedicated, in the Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides, presented probably in 414 (ADelt 22 Mel 156 f.). Rhamnous. The decree of the year 264-63 found in the Sanctuary of Nemesis in I960, which has already been cited among the archaeological evidence for the intervention of the Egyptian force under Patroclus in the Chremonidean War (AR 1961-62 5), 1 'H 'Avaar'jcoateg -rg Lrozga t TI Bpavp6bvog (Athens, Arch- aeological Service, 1967).</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 7 has now been published by V. Petrakos. It refers to the activities of Epichares who was atpaly,6 E t rv napaliav in the anti-Macedonian interest and had his headquarters in the Sanctuary (ADelt 22 Mel 38 ff.). Aegina. A new programme of supplementary investigations within the Sanctuary of Aphaia and in those areas immediately adjoining it to which Furtwangler's excavations of 190I-2 did not extend, was started by D. Ohly in 1967 with the sponsorship of the German Institute. Soundings to the north and east established that here, for the most part, the slopes outside the supporting wall of the temenos had not been examined. From the field terraces con- structed in the area since antiquity and from the surface of the scree beneath them were recovered architectural elements from both the present temple and its predecessor, as well as fragments of Early and Late Archaic sculpture in Parian marble. The latter included a head fragment from one of the warriors in the west pediment, a leg with greave of warrior 'H' of the east pediment and fragments of two ridge-akroteria. In I968 it is planned to expose the unexcavated sections of the north and south retaining walls of the temenos terrace. Work has also been resumed in the Apollo Sanc- tuary, by the town of Aegina, with H. Walter in charge, but was limited in 1967 to cleaning of the remains previously exposed. Further investigation of the prehistoric town wall discovered by G. Welter nearby is planned. CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS Isthmia. When excavations were resumed in 1967, under the joint direction of O. Broneer and P. Clement, several points in and around the Sanctuary of Poseidon were further examined. In the field west of Kyras Vrysi nineteen sarcophagus burials were investigated, the earliest dating from the sixth century B.c. (fragments of a comast cup by the KY painter). The main effort was directed to the wall across the Isthmus and its connected fortress to the east of the Sanctuary. The northeast gate to the fortress and its surroundings were fully exposed (Fig. 8). In the process, voussoirs, Ionic entablature blocks and other members of the Roman triumphal arch which formed its core were recovered (plan in BSA 32, 72 fig. 2). Two Ionic capitals and nu- merous drums from this area must have been brought there as building material from the theatre, for they fit the two bases remaining in the orchestra. Fourth and fifth century coins found in crevices of the paved road prove that this belongs to a phase anterior to Justinian's work on the fortifications. At the junction of the trans-Isthmian wall with the gate complex (the wall forms the north rampart of the fortress) suspicions were aroused that the wall also may in part antedate Justinian's work. For a staircase leading to the wall-walk lost its lowest tread to make room for a later burial at this point (Fig. 8, left), and if the fifth century coins in an adjacent grave may be regarded as any indication of the date of these burials (may they not rather relate to the strata in which the graves were dug?) they could hardly be post-Justinianic. Beneath the west curtain of the fortress, in the area of its most northerly tower, an earlier wall of large well-cut blocks on a heavy rubble footing was traced for a length of 50 m. The lowest layer against the footing was rich in finds, including a two-handled cup with relief decoration under green glaze, two coins of A.D. 67/68 and debris of fresco decoration, including two fragments with figures. Cenchreae. There was no excavation in 1967, but work proceeded on the conservation of the unique panels of glass opus sectile previously found. A full account of the campaigns to 1966 has appeared in Hesperia 36, 124 ff. Corinth. The American School exca- vations were continued in 1967 under the direction of C. K. Williams, in three areas. In the Peribolos of Apollo, further investigation of the area where water installations of the fifth century B.C. had been found (AR 1966-67, fig. 9) estab- lished that these were part of a dye-works with drying floors to the west. A test under the earliest of these floors produced no pottery later than Middle Corinthian, and since murex and shells similar to the fusus tuberculatus were found in the same test, the dyeing industry may have been established here even before the floor was laid. The wall bounding this drying floor on the south appears to be a con- temporary reconstruction of the temenos wall of Temple A, but by the second half of the fourth century the dye-works had extended beyond it. The foundation of the 'Hellenistic Stoa' to the north was found to have been built in the Early Roman period (though resting in part on FIG. 8</page><page sequence="6">8 A. H. S. MEGAW late fourth century retaining wall) after the abandon- ment of the dye-works. North of the Peribolos of Apollo and behind the shops along the Lechaion Road, clearance of later structures and levels was undertaken to reveal those associated with the Roman Bath in this area (Corinth xvi, 16). This probably dates from the first century A.D. and appears to have fallen into disuse before the end of the fourth century. It has no apsidal- ended rooms, no exedrae and much of the original fabric consists of large poros blocks. Work was resumed at the larger and later Roman Baths lying further north. A second caldarium was discovered, preserving much of its flooring over the hypocaust (Fig. 9). Outside its west wall was large quantities of mould fragments used in casting at least one life-size bronze statue. The other building includes a small apsidal construction open to the west and appears to date from the fourth century A.D. In its foundation trench was found a tightly-rolled strip of lead, not yet fully unrolled but seen to bear a long inscription, probably a curse. The overlying destruction debris is datable to the sixth century. In a new area of the cemetery in the Hollow of Lerna, a series of Early Christian graves was found intact. Above them was preserved in some cases much of the stuccoed mound with which each had been covered, as well as numerous clay lamps that had been lit over the graves. Construction of a section of the new National Road to Patras across the North Cemetery (in 1965) involved prior excavation by the late S. Charitonides of numerous graves, some containing cremations in cylindrical urns, and a few chamber tombs. They ranged between the Classical and the Early Christian periods, and many had been used more than once. A section of ancient road dating from the Archaic period was also exposed (ADelt 21 Chr 121 ff.). Sikyon. The tracing of the same road immediately west of the Asopus located extensive remains of buildings of the fifth and fourth centuries with pebble mosaic floors, which Charitonides identified with Aegialea from the indications of Pausanias (ADelt 21 Chr 124). Mycenae. In further investigations on the east slope of the acropolis G. Mylonas (A.S.) has clarified the chronology of the buildings forming the east wing of the Palace (plan in AR 1966-67 8, fig. Ii). The material used to form the artificial terrace carrying the court of the House of Columns (6 m. deep on the south side) was found to include some painted Mycenaean sherds, the latest datable to the second half of the LH IIIB period. In the Basement of the Pithoi to the south of the court, a substantial fragment of a Linear B tablet was found in a thin deposit on the last floor. It belongs to group L and is the first from Mycenae to refer to textiles (Fig. zo). A deposit of amphora fragments found on the floor of the adjoining section, named by Mylonas the Building of the Artists and Artisans (2 on the plan), dates the destruction of the east wing of the Palace to the latest phase of LH IIIB. Cleaning of later walls overlying the House of FIG. 9 found a large number of marble architectural members fallen from its two-storey Corinthian faCade. This had acanthus leaves on the lower frieze, but otherwise had much in common with the Captives' Facade in the Agora. The latter has been dated to the mid-second century (Corinth I ii, 87) but Williams suggests it is somewhat later and may commemorate the Parthian victories of Septimius Severus. Further west, across a court paved with herring-bone tiling, remains of a portico have been found with traces of its original mosaic floor. It was doubtless through this portico that the Baths were entered from the Lechaion Road. Excavation of the scant remains of the Gymnasium was resumed by J. R. Wiseman for the University of Texas under the auspices of the American School (for the 1966 excavations in this area see now Hesperia 36, 402 ff). More of the east end of the double stoa on the south side was uncovered. It was seen that a partition connected the interior columns and while only one drum was found in place on the main stylobate, six of the stuccoed Doric capitals were found dumped in a row in the robbing trench on the line of the back wall. In the area known as the "West Waterworks" two independent buildings were identified. One was a bronze foundry which went out of use in the third century A.D.; it yielded FIG. o</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 9 Columns produced LH IIIC sherds, indicating a partial reconstruction in that period. The two separate buildings lying to the northeast (6 and 7 on the plan) were also further examined. They comprise the remains of basement rooms dating in both cases from the LH IIIB period. That aligned with the north wall of the citadel, where more extensive deposits were found, produced evidence of destruction by fire, at the same time as the Palace buildings, and of reconstruction in the LH IIIC period. Tiryns. In the spring of 1968 the German Insti- tute, with J. Shifer in charge, resumed excavation on a considerable scale. At the time of writing the work is centred on the lower, northern enclosure of the citadel. Here deep deposits were exposed during the investigation which followed the dis- covery in 1962 of the passages leading to extra-mural springs (AR 1964-65 I ). FIG. II Midea. The finds from the Swedish excavation on the acropolis in 1939 have now been published by Miss G. Walberg (Opuscula Atheniensia vii 161 ff.). Argos. In 1967 the French School resumed its excavations in two sectors, Y. Garlan, F. Croissant, J. F. Bommelaer, J. P. Sodini and Mlle. H. Sarian participating. In the Agora (sector a), the area immediately south of the east arm of the H-shaped portico produced stratigraphical indications of con- tinuous occupation since Hellenistic times; only one earlier stratum was found, containing Geometric pottery exclusively. Further south, beyond a brick sewer of monumental proportions and Roman date, the end of a small tetrastyle prostyle building was exposed, apparently of the Late Hellenistic period (Fig. xx). Its columns, arranged with a larger central intercolumniation, seem to have been shafts of wood finished with stucco. In sector delta, work centred on the open space to the south of the FIG. 12 Epidaurus. N. Yalouris's work on the Asklepios temple sculptures has led on to a study of the Nike akroteria from the temple of Artemis. In addition to joining seven fragments found in the museums in Athens and Epidaurus to three known figures, a balancing pair and the somewhat heavie;r but finer No. 161, he adds the bust of a fourth (Fig. I2). This is of the same marble and the same heavier build as No. 161, with which Yalouris pairs it on the east front, relegating the other pair to the west (ADelt 22 Mel 25 ff-.). Porto Cheli. Further exploration was undertaken in 1967 by T. W. Jacobsen and M. H. Jameson, for the Universities of Indiana and Pennsylvania, under Odeum. Here three early occupation layers (MH to Mycenaean) are followed immediately by an Archaic votive deposit enclosed by a later peribolos wall. The earliest contents of the deposit date from the beginning of the sixth century, if not earlier. It also produced terracotta figurines, objects of bronze, ivory and gold and numerous sherds in- scribed with dedications to Aphrodite. No monu- mental remains of her sanctuary in this area, which Pausanias mentions (ii 20o. 8), have been found, unless a rectangular, but very ruined mass of poros be an altar. A sounding to the MH level revealed an unusual grave for this period: a cremation trench. This contained a matt-painted cantharos of the latest MH phase and remains of the pyre below charred bones. In addition, a rescue excavation in the D. Hatzi- xenophon property near the southeast angle of the same open space, carried out at the request of the Archaeological Service, disclosed part of a villa. It has floor mosaics and a small rotunda formerly roofed with a dome. Coins among the destruction debris indicate that it survived until the reign of Constans II.</page><page sequence="8">1o A. H. S. MEGAW the sponsorship of the American School. More of the submerged stretch of the city wall (plan in AJA 71, pl. 88, fig. 15) was cleaned with a high pressure pump and photographed from a balloon. Several new towers came to light. At one point two stretches of the wall are not aligned, but form a 20 m. re- entrant between the circular towers in which they terminate. A 7 m. gap in this re-entrant may have been a sea-gate leading into a basin within the fortifications. On the beach, south of Porto Cheli at 'Lorenzo', a Post-classical tile kiln was excavated. Parts of the hearth floor, two firing chambers beneath it and two stoking chambers (now extending into the sea) are preserved. At the 'Frachthi' cave near Koilada, northwest of Porto Cheli, several trenches were sunk into Neo- lithic deposits, two of them to a depth of 6 m. without reaching the bottom. In the Late Neolithic phase coarse pottery predominated, but fragments with decoration in matt paint (dark on light, light on dark and polychrome) are not uncommon. The Middle Neolithic is better represented, notably by the fine quality Urfirnis ware with decoration in lustrous red- brown to black paint (Fig. 13) well-known at FIG. 13 Corinth and Lerna. An Early Neolithic deposit is also attested. Characteristic tools (stone, flint, obsidian, bone points) and ornaments were also found, including an anthropomorphic amulet from the Middle Neolithic level (Fig. 14). Below the pottery levels in the deep trenches, a deposit of aceramic remains was found, about I m. in depth. Here the animal bones from the lower levels are characterised by the predominance of red deer and large bovid; whereas those from the upper aceramic levels show the first appearance of sheep and goat and an increase in the frequency of pig, suggesting a transition to domestication. ARCADIA TO ELIS Tegea. Partial excavation by Miss A. Demako- poulou of the Late Roman house, in a wall of which the new Nike acroterion was found (AR r965-66 fig. Io), led to the recovery of many architectural fragments from the temple of Athena Alea and a few fragments from the pediment figures (ADelt 21 Chr 152 f.). Bassae. A study of the sculpture fragments found in the Archaeological Society's excavations in the temple has enabled N. Yalouris to accommodate casts of seven of them in the frieze, which in turn has led to the placing of five unattached fragments in the British Museum. With the help of John Foster's drawings, the original set of which has lately been presented to the Gennadius Library by George Seferis, Yalouris has also established that an isolated head in the British Museum belongs to the formerly headless Amazon on panel 542 of the frieze (AE 1967, I87 ff.). Skoura (Laconia). A group of chamber tombs from a previously unknown Mycenaean cemetery at 'Melathria' 2 km. north of the village were excavated in 1966 by Miss D. Demakopoulou. They produced 20 whole vases and many fragments of local fabrics of LH IIIA I to IIIB styles, three phi-shaped figurines, an iron ring, beads and buttons (AAA I, 37 ff-). Elaphonisos. N. C. Flemming of the National Institute of Oceanography, during study of sea level changes at known ancient sites on the east and southeast coasts of the Peloponnese in the summer of 1967 (see Nature 217, 103I f.), discovered submerged remains of what is apparently a Bronze Age city in the strait between Elaphonisos and the mainland. A detailed survey of the visible remains, which are extensive and constructed in un-worked stone, is planned for the summer of 1968 by a party from Cambridge University led by R. C. Jones, under the sponsorship of the British School. Pylos. With a view to establishing the extent of the ancient remains in the reclaimed area of the Yialova lagoon prior to its distribution to cultivators, N. Yalouris in 1965 excavated part of a Hellenistic cemetery. This appears to have extended much FIG. 14</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 11 of the way from Yialova to the east slopes of Kory- phasion, on either side of an ancient road. Fourth century use of the same area is attested by grave stelai used in the construction of the later graves, many of which were grouped in burial enclosures each containing one or more pyres. Much pottery was recovered with other finds, including some lamps, glass bowls and bronze mirrors (ADelt 21 Chr 164 f.). Methone. Excavations by D. Pallas (A.S.) in the rock-cut cemetery at 'Ayios Onouphrios' (AR 1962-63 18) have clarified the initial layout and funerary usages in the Early Christian period. The numerous graves had all been robbed and most of the finds relate to the Medieval period, when the chambers were occupied by hermits. Olympia. The German Institute's excavations have not been resumed, but E. Kunze has continued work on the finds from recent campaigns with a view to publication. Meanwhile the eighth Bericht appeared in 1967, covering the campaigns of 1958 to 1962, when the greater part of the work in the Stadium was carried out and some of the best helmets and small bronzes were found. A detailed study of the Heraion and its predecessors by A. Mallwitz has appeared in Jdl 81, 312 ff. The improvements resulting from N. Yalouris's addition of about 200 fragments to the existing restorations of the metopes and pediment groups are illustrated in Olympia: the Temple of Zeus by B. Ashmole and N. Yalouris published in 1967 (Phaidon Press) with excellent photographs by Alison Frantz. Amalias. The evidence for Palaeolithic industries obtained in I963-64, from 19 sites to the southwest of the town, by A. Leroi-Gourhan, J. Chavaillon and others under the auspices of the French School, covers mainly developed Moust6ero-Levallois and Early Upper Palaeolithic phases (BCH 91, 151 ff.). Peneios Barrage. In October and November 1967, following a request for assistance from the Greek Archaeological Service, the foreign Schools undertook a survey of the ancient remains in the area to be inundated and carried out trial excavations on a number of sites. For the Austrian Institute, Mrs V. Leon-Mitsopoulou examined the area of 'Armatova' Hill to establish the limits of the site tested by P. Themeli (see AR 1966-67 11), where further ex- cavation is desirable. On the north side of the Peneios valley, upstream from Xenias, which was assigned to the French School, P. Ducrey and Mlle. F. Vandenabeele studied the change in the course of the river since antiquity and identified a cist grave of Hellenistic date on the single hill that rises above the alluvial plain. No visible remains of occupation before Medieval times were found. L. Beschi surveyed the area north of the river between Xenias and the barrage for the Italian School. Here also a deep accumulation of alluvium covers any ancient remains there may be on the floor of the valley; but on the higher ground northwest of Xenias, by the site of its Medieval predecessor 'Palae6 Chori6', a Classical-Hellenistic settlement was located. Surface finds here included two flint implements, possibly Palaeolithic. West of Daouti another occupation site, Hellenistic and later, was identified. Near the head of the 'Langadia', a tributary valley to the north, some graves and a pithos burial of an Early Christian cemetery were excavated, as well as some isolated structures of Hellenistic-Roman date. South of the Peneios, F. W. Hamdorf investigated for the German Institute the area between Souli and Agrapidochori, including the lower valley of the Ladon. On the west side of the Ladon valley, below Velanidi, he recorded three occupation sites in the area 'Ayios Nikolaos': Classical and later, Roman, Medieval. North of Roupakia, indications of a prehistoric (?MH) settlement were observed at 'Aetia' and on the hill 'Ayios Nikolaos' numerous Early Archaic sherds indicative of a sanctuary (or tomb?). Classical-Hellenistic settlements were identified east of Souli at 'Tis Grias to Mnima', at a site closer to the village, and on the saddle 'Chro- nidias' nearer to Roupakia. The remainder of the south side of the Peneios valley from Souli to the barrage and the lower part of the tributary valley of the Loukia' were surveyed by J. R. Wiseman of the American School. On the Palaeoch6ri plateau close to Souli he collected some worked chert and obsidian; test trenches failed to produce evidence of prehistoric occupation but confirmed this as a Late Roman and Byzantine village site. At 'Piskopi6s' on the east side of the Loukia valley, opposite Ayios Ilias, four sites close together, one of them reportedly a church, produced Late Roman sherds, rooftiles, roughcut blocks, a well and in one case glazed sherds, suggesting a scattered Early Byzantine and later settlement. 'Panagoula' close to the east bank of the Loukiai was indicated as the source of an Early Byzantine marble capital in Ayios Ilias; while on the hill 'Vigla' further south, and at Ayios Athanasios to the east of it, cemeteries of the same period were recorded. The extensive area remaining to the south, the wide upper valley of the Loukiai around Kato Loukavitsa, was assigned to the British School and surveyed by a team led by R. Howell. Much evidence was found of settlement in the Hellenistic period, based at least partly on a tile-industry (there are six disused modern tile kilns in the area, and a village named Keramidia). Trial trenches in an area with vast quantities of tile fragments at 'Keramidia', east of the hamlet Ayios Spyridon below Kalatha, disclosed traces of burning and a floor of tightly packed tiles, possibly indicating a tile factory. On the opposite, east side of the valley at 'Kos- toureika' a trench in an area with Hellenistic sherds of good quality uncovered walls which may belong to a villa of some importance. Among surface sherds was a clay stamp with an incised sigma over a seal impression. The two earliest sites recorded were 'Yero Yanni Rachi' above Ayios Ilias, which produced Grey Minyan pottery (perhaps from a pithos burial), and 'Tsaleika' south of the hamlet Oraia, where a scatter of Mycenaean sherds was found, but these are probably high enough not to be threatened. Other sites in this area which will be</page><page sequence="10">12 A. H. S. MEGAW submerged, at least in part, include one with Geo- metric pottery at 'Koutsi' in a gulley northeast of Ano Loukavitsa, an artificial mound called 'Palaio- chori' near the same village, several sites with traces of occupation in the Classical and Hellenistic periods, some possibly no more than farmhouses, and a Medieval village site called 'Frangoklisi' southeast of Ano Loukavitsa. Further excavation on the more important sites found is planned by the various Schools for 1968 and 1969. Meanwhile the Archaeological Service, with G. Papathanasopoulos in charge, is examining the ancient remains on the route selected for the main irrigation canal below the barrage, which as originally planned, would have traversed the area of the ancient Elis for a distance of two kilometres (see below). Elis. In the theatre N. Yalouris (A.S.) and Mrs V. Leon-Mitsopoulou (Austrian Institute) uncovered more of the radial ramps paved with river stones. Material excavated below these confirmed the original construction date around 400 B.C., and it was also established that the stone staircases above them date from the Hellenistic period. In the orchestra area, exploration of a series of cuttings (foundation trenches?) was resumed, and a trial behind the retaining wall of the east parados dis- closed remains of a pyre and a great quantity of Geometric to Classical sherds. In the South Stoa area, the section of mosaic floor surviving from the Early Christian basilica which replaced it was relaid. FIG. 15 The emergency excavations of the team led by G. Papathanasopoulos on the route proposed for the main irrigation canal from the Peneios Barrage have extended from the east cemetery, where apart from Late Classical burials, two Sub-Mycenaean tombs were found, to the Classical west cemetery, where some 200 graves have been excavated. In the city area buildings mainly of the Roman period have been uncovered, some of them with mosaic floors; notable is a medallion with symbols of the nine muses and Mnemosyne ringing a central lyre, for Apollo. The task of selecting the least harmful route for the canal has been aided by a magnetometer lent by the Pennsylvania University Museum and operated by Miss E. Ralph (Eleftheros Kosmos 22/v/I968). CENTRAL GREECE, EUBOEA AND THESSALY Thebes. Pending availability of the properties under acquisition in the central area of the Kadmeia, excavation has been limited to a strip along the Antigone Street frontage of the site where the unique group of cylinder seals was found (AR 1964-65 15). The construction of a retaining-wall for the street on this strip in 1965 gave Mrs E. Touloupa an oppor- tunity to study the stratification immediately to the south of the Room of the Treasure. In the later Mycenaean level, beyond the south wall of that room, part of a store-room with pithoi was found. To the east of these two rooms was a hard gravel layer, evidently a road, and beneath it a drain containing bases and handles of Mycenaean kylikes. Earlier Mycenaean walls were found at the same depth and with the same orientation as those of the 'First Palace' previously discovered, beneath which MH remains overlay the substantial south wall of the apsidal EH building. Lefkandi. In May 1968 a trench mechanically excavated for a waterpipe cut through the Proto- geometric cemetery where four cist tombs and a pit-burial were found during the British School's trials in 1964. A short excavation was carried out by P. Themelis (Archaeological Service) with M. R. Popham and L. H. Sackett (British School). On the course of the pipe-line and in a short trench connect- ing this with the area opened in 1964, 19 new crema- tion burials in cist tombs, I I pyres and two pit-burials were found. The pottery, mainly from the cist tombs, includes a Sub-Mycenaean stirrup-jar; but the bulk of it is Early Protogeometric. Notable are several triple-vases and three askoi, two of the duck type (Fig. 15). The latest use of the cemetery is indicated by an imported skyphos of Early Attic Geometric type. Bronze fibulae, finger-rings and earrings were also found, as well as iron pins (one plated with gold) and a necklace of small faience beads. This new evidence for the Early Proto- geometric phase is particularly welcome since no stratified deposit of this period was preserved in the small area excavated in the adjoining 'Xeropolis' settlement, on which see now the preliminary report Excavations at Lefkandi, Euboea, I964-66 (Thames and Hudson, 1968). Mt Olympus. The construction of a Meteoro- logical Station (in 1961-65) on the rounded summit 'Ayios Antonios', south of 'Mytikas' (the highest peak) and only Ioo m. lower, led to the discovery of fragmentary stelai and other evidence of a sanctuary of Zeus Olympios. The coins found attest its existence at least as early as Hellenistic times and well into the Christian era; the latest is a solidus of Leo I (D. V. Kyriazopoulou and G. Livada in ADelt 22 Mel 6 ff.).</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 13 EPIRUS AND THE IONIAN ISLANDS Asprochaliko and Kastritsa. In a further campaign in 1967 under the sponsorship of the British School, E. S. Higgs rounded-off his excavations in these two Palaeolithic caves. For one of the Upper Palaeo- lithic layers overlying the deep Mousterian deposits at Asprochaliko a radiocarbon dating about 24,000 B.C. has been obtained, and another about 9,000 B.C. for a late glacial geometric industry. Since at Kastritsa the ten metre Upper Palaeolithic deposits cover the same period as the upper layers at Aspro- chaliko there are valuable controls between the evidence from the two sites, which together offer the only full succession for this period between France and the Levant. At Kastritsa further well-defined beach deposits left by successive changes in the level of Ioannina lake were identified, making five in all, the last datable about 22,000 B.C. From the intermediate strata deposited by occupants of the cave during the periodical recessions of the lake, many implements of successive industries were recovered. The climatic succession for Epirus thus established may be related, Higgs suggests, to that of North Africa and offer a new link with the European glacial succession. The later layers at Kastritsa produced evidence of no less than five man-made structures, in the shape of well-defined sets of post-holes, each forming a semicircle round a hearth (Fig. I6). No radio- carbon dating is yet available for these post-holes, but they must be placed between the limits 15,000 to 9,000 B.C., a period for which evidence of man- made constructions of any kind is exceedingly rare, and in Greece unknown. FIG. 17 MIX . Xl ...... . ...... .......... that Kastritsa must have been uninhabitable in a glacial winter. Comparison of the animal bones found there with those found at Asprochaliko suggests that the seasonal occupation at Kastritsa was connected with the migration to the summer pastures on the Pindus of the animals which the Palaeolithic inhabitants of the area hunted. Nikopolis. A. Xyngopoulos has republished the little-known and now damaged mosaic heads on the side of the statue-base re-used as the ambon platform in Basilica B. He regards the round-faced beardless youth and the long-faced, bearded elder with receding brow as patron saints (not founder and foundress as was formerly suggested), and as representatives of the style of the late fifth century and the first years of the sixth. If they are contemporary with the building of the basilica, Alkison, whose long archiepiscopate lasted from before 451 to 516, could be regarded as founder of the whole church and not only of the annexe which bears his name in its mosaic floor (ADelt 22 Mel I5 ff.). Dodona. S. Dakaris (A.S.) has com- pleted his investigations south and east of the bouleuterion, where the added portico is now datable to the beginning of the third century B.c. Between it and naiskos A excavated by Evangelides, a triangular area previously undug was also examined. Here a stratum which antedates the naiskos yielded female figurine fragments (some holding doves) of Classical types, possibly extending into the early third century. A dedica- tion to Aphrodite is suggested and a construction date contemporary with the portico. From the same area came a small bronze eagle on a lotus flower of late Classical style and of the first quality, probably the finial from the sceptre held by a statuette of Zeus A cz:;: . . ........ ..... . . ..

These have rarely been found in contemporary contexts in Eastern or South-Eastern Europe. From his climatological studies, Higgs concludes (cover picture); also a lion of Archaic Laconian style, with head turned to the right, evidently a votive complete in itself (Fig. I8). Soundings in the deposit underlying the Hel- lenistic remains revealed for the first time satisfactory evidence of prehistoric occupation on the site of the sanctuary: regularly-placed post-holes ringed with</page><page sequence="12">14 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 18 stones for rectangular rooms and pits containing flints and pottery. The latter includes flat-based, flaring bowls of a mottled ware. A notable find was a pit-oven, capped evidently by the top half of a pithos. Imported Mycenaean sherds of LH IIIC type and local imitations give a closing date in the thirteenth century B.c. for the settlement, which Dakaris connects with the Selli of Iliad xvi 234-5. Kerkyra. A further excavation campaign in 1967 FIG. 19 has enabled G. Dontas to outline the history of the sanctuary area to the east of the ancient city, now lying within the royal park of 'Mon Repos'. The earliest finds indicate the presence of a sanctuary there from the first years of the Corinthian colonisa- tion. Before the end of the seventh century followed the erection of the great Doric temple with columns and parts of the entablature in local limestone and a tile roof. Outside its peribolos other cults were established: of Apollo, whose hypaethral sanctuary and altar were discovered in the latest campaigns and identified by an inscription on a perirrhanterion fragment; of Aphrodite and Hermes (attested by votives), whose little temples are dated by their roof-tiles to the second half of the sixth century. After the sanctuary had been destroyed by fire at the end of the fifth century (probably in the civil war) the temple was rebuilt early in the fourth, with a marble roof (lionhead spouts) but the rest in lime- stone. The peribolos was enlarged, and the debris of the Archaic temple was dumped behind the new wall. The sanctuary did not survive into the imperial period, and was probably destroyed by Agrippa's troops on the eve of the Battle of Actium; the evidence secured in recent excavations in the town indicates that the greater part of the ancient Corcyra was destroyed at this time. Notable among new finds from the sanctuary are a bronze comast, running with a rhyton in his hand, an attachment from a large lebes of about 570 B.c. (Fig. xg), and a small kouros head of local stone and Corinthian style of about 535-530 (AAA I, 66 ff.). MACEDONIA Dion. Further investigation of the superimposed remains of the two basilicas, by S. Pelekanides for the University of Thessaloniki, disclosed (in I964) that the mosaic floors of the earlier Basilica A have for the most part survived in excellent condition. On the walls of the narthex the lower parts of a fresco imitation of marble revetments are also well pre- served (Fig. 2o). At two points the representation of marble inlay work between pilasters is interrupted by landscape panels. Pelekanides also studied the very curious articulation of the colonnades of the later and larger Basilica B (plan in AE I929, I8o, fig. I I), whereby six corresponding columns on each side were doubled on the nave side by others of somewhat smaller size forming three projecting pairs in each case. He found nothing to support the view that the smaller columns were later additions (ADelt 20 Chr 477 ff-). Verria. Discoveries during emergency excavations (in I964) reported by Ph. Petsas include an inscrip- tion, built into a late floor on the site of the Second Primary School, which attests the dedication of stoas in a sanctuary of Athena by Philip V. Elsewhere, new sections of paved streets of the Roman period have been exposed (ADelt 20 Chr 423 if.). Prespa. N. Moutsopoulos (A.S.) has continued his clearance and excavations in and around the ruined basilica of St Achilleios, for which in a full</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 15 FIG. 20 account of the 1965 campaign he proposed a con- struction date around A.D. 990.1 Of the church proper there now remains to be cleared only the north aisle and the north half of the narthex. In the south half of the latter, in earth accumulated over roof-tiles and other destruction debris, were numerous graves of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Within the church no more burials dating from the short period of its use were found. The intact eleventh century tomb F in the south aisle opened in I965 yielded a fragment of silk and gold thread textile, of which the pattern (roundels each containing two parrots back to back) has since been recovered. West of the narthex no further structures were found, but east of the apse the remains of a series of annexes extending towards the lake shore was uncovered. Thessaloniki. A notable acquisition of the Thes- saloniki Museum (in 1964) is a well-preserved bronze portrait head, approximately life size, of good third century style and provisionally identified as Gallienus (Fig. 21). It was found during ploughing at Ryakia (Pieria) (ADelt 20 Chr 412). Mrs M. Karamanoli-Siganidou's supplementary excavations (in I964) in the Octagon, discovered by Ch. Makaronas in 1950 and usually regarded as part of the Palace of Galerius, exposed a partially preserved marble floor including parts of four panels of elaborate opus sectile near the entrance. On the floor lay four marble pilaster capitals from the wall revetments (and fragments of others) on each of which a male figure in high relief, either draped or nude, is the centrepiece (Fig. 22). 30 cm. below this floor an earlier one of mosaic was found (ADelt 20 Chr 409). Nea Anchialos (Ingliz). During excavations for oil storage tanks on the upper plateau (cf. BCH 41-43, 74 ff.), a valuable association of Early Iron Age Mace- donian pottery with Geometric imports of Attic type was secured from a well- defined occupation level examined (in 1964) by Agni Sakellariou (ADelt 20 Chr 42 1). Amphipolis. In a further campaign at the large Basilica A, E. Stikas (A.S.) has virtually completed the clearance of the rather well preserved remains of the church proper. Thirteen of the twenty bases are in situ and many of the columns remain where they had fallen, including some from the gallery arcades with their capitals of Ionic- impost type. In the nave, where the marble paving has been robbed, the base of the ambon was found near the south colonnade together with part of its deeply moulded and carved balu- strade. The H-shaped presbytery and semicircular synthronon have also been cleared. Further sections of the floor mosaics in the aisles have been exposed, including a well preserved panel occupying the section of the south aisle corresponding with the presbytery. This has a network of panels containing birds extended over FIG. 21 1 'EorTznp. 'Enrzenpi IHolv. Xzo2ig Oe aaatoviKir ii (1965) 134.</page><page sequence="14">16 A. H. S. MEGAW Dikili-Tash. The joint Greek-French excavations on the Prehistoric mound, interrupted since 1961 (see BCH 86, 912 ff.), were resumed in 1967. The French team, led by M. J. Deshayes, opened four new squares without any trace of the Thermi/Troy I stratum FIG. 22 a 'sea' well-stocked with fish and a central medallion ringed by a garland, within which peacocks drink from a vase. Philippi. S. Pelekanides (A.S.) has resumed in- vestigation of the remains of the atrium of the basilica which the octagonal church replaced. Its south portico was found to have been entered from the south through a wide door in the centre of a semi- circular exedra, once revetted with marble. The stylobate on the south side of the atrium appears to have returned southwards at its west end. A further part of the mosaic floor of the basilica itself was found under the paving of the northeast section of the octagon ambulatory (Fig. 23). Excavation of the annexes northeast of the octagon was also resumed. These were entered from the north-south passage bounding the Baptistery complex on the east side. Five more inter-communicating rooms in the nature of basement stores (pithoi) were found; also, in a corridor forming their northern limit, the bottom of a staircase leading to the main floor above, for which frescoed decoration both Geometric and floral is evidenced by fallen fragments. FIG. 23 FIG. 24 found in the earlier excavations. Instead eleven Late Neolithic layers I - 70 m. in total depth were exposed. Except for some hearths the structural remains were meagre. Some of the pottery has analogies with Karanovo V-VI types. The techniques are graphite-painting, incision with white paste filling (Fig. 24) or decoration with a bright rose-coloured paint. Meanders and spirals recalling the Gumelnitsa style are common. Black on red wares include that previously found both on this site and at Dhimitra and a new one with large symmetrical volutes, which could be a local fabric. The Galepsos style is also represented. Stone imple- ments and female figurines predominate among the other finds. A deep sounding produced a new type of pottery, appa- rently Middle Neolithic. In one of the 1961 squares a test below the level pre- viously reached established that the occupation with Thermi type pottery overlies a deep destruction layer cover- ing a level with black on red pottery of Gumelnitsa style. In consequence, this campaign has satisfactorily established</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 I7 the stratigraphy of the site from Middle Neolithic to Early Bronze. A further campaign in the Greek sector was directed by D. Theocharis. THRACE Abdera. An account of P. Lazarides's discovery of the West Gate (in 1964) and of his excavation of the stretch of wall and flanking tower to the south has now appeared. The wall is some 2-30 m. thick and has a rubble core between faces constructed of rather irregular courses of headers and stretchers alternating with courses of headers laid flat. Red- figure sherds were found in the foundation trench, together with many of the late sixth century, in- cluding East Greek wares. The house of the fourth century B.c. previously located to the east of this stretch of wall was further examined and found to include a small store-room filled with pointed am- phorae (ADelt 20 Chr 453 ff.). Stryme. The results of G. Bakalakis's limited excavation (in 1957-59) on the peninsula between Porto-Lago and Maroneia, which he identifies as Stryme of the Thasian peraia, have appeared under the title 'Av2oKoMq( L'rplnr; (Thessaloniki Univ. 1967). The earliest sherds found would antedate the passage of the Persians, in which connexion the town is mentioned by Herodotus, and the latest finds, which include a hoard of 28 tetradrachms of Maroneia, indicate that it did not survive the mid- fourth century. THE CYCLADES Andros. In the summer of 1967, A. Cambitoglou (A.S.), with financial assistance and staff from the University of Sydney, directed the first of several excavation campaigns planned at the Geometric settlement at Zagora, a promontory on the west coast of the Island. A defence wall closing the only approach to the site was identified and at some distance within it a considerable area of the settle- ment, including a temple, was uncovered (Fig. 25). The rooms vary greatly in size, but in no case have internal supports been found. The walls are of local schist and a little marble with some clay filling and the clay roofs seem to have been formed on stone slabs bridging the spans between close-set beams. Several central hearths were found and nine of the rooms have stone benches about I 20 m. wide against the walls, in some of which pithoi had been set. The temple, like that at Emporio in Chios, is of the modified 'megaron' form, with an internal altar. The group of rooms closest to it (nos. 17-19) may form a single residence, possibly that of the ruler. The finds indicate occupation in the eighth century and abandonment (without any subsequent re- occupation) early in the seventh. Noteworthy are a fragmentary Late Geometric pithos with bands of relief decoration, a fragment from an early seventh century vase with relief and incised bands including a row of dancing figures (Fig. 26), an oinochoe ** 3 4 12 N 6 8 13 10 14 911 9 \is 16 t 1 24 17 24 25 20 26 119 22 27 28 21 23 TEMPLE 29 10 0 to 10 20 m L , FIG. 25 SO 'to -7 1 1 1 W i r iiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiii .ii ii FIG. 26 probably imported from Corinth and, among many clay spindle-whorls, one which may be an import from Athens.

"th Ni IMP!- W, - WE Rmm l, WOMA PW gill -41 FIG. 27 within the section of fortification wall which it adjoins, no earlier approach to the spring was located, but the curving end of a substantial Middle Bronze Age building was found. Outside the northeastern fortifications excellent Mycenaean IIIA sherds were found in discarded debris; also a dump of small Archaic and Classical pots which probably derives from clearance of a later shrine in the area of the Bronze Age temple. In the latter, further investigations below sea level clarified the history of the building from the MH period onwards and established that the podium and benches in the outer room (Fig. 27) are LH IIIC reconstructions. A sounding outside the temple reached habitation deposits with much EH pottery. This is unlike the EH II wares found elsewhere on the site and probably reflects an Anatolian tradition. Further investigation in the area outside the east wall revealed a robbed grave, close outside the Main Gate. The grave had evidently been covered by a small tumulus; it yielded a grey bowl of Cy- cladic type. Sizable structures in front of the gate (and somewhat obstructing it) were shown to be at least as old as the great period of the town. The drainage system in this region, suggesting an ample water supply, was also further examined. The new trenches south and west of the church revealed house walls of good masonry, including in one case rooms, corridors and a well-built stairway. Here, as elsewhere, there were signs of earthquake damage and the associated debris, which is related to the great period of the town, included fine pottery of LM IB and LH IIA styles. But here there were no signs of the re-occupation attested for other areas by pottery of the LH IIIA: i phase. Delos. The French School's exploration of the Skardana quarter was resumed in 1967 by Ph. Bruneau, G. Siebert and M-Th. Couilloud. The street leading from the sanctuary to Skardana bay has now been exposed throughout its length and work has started on insula E, lying to the west of that on which the excavations of the preceding campaigns had centred, now known as the Insula of the Jewels. The houses in insula E are notable in that they are intercommunicating. One of them (Ea) is arranged round a peristyle court and boasts an oecus with a mosaic floor and remains of polychrome wall decora- tion. In another (Eb), a row of humbler rooms front the north side of a court. Here many changes were made when, after the house was burnt and abandoned (probably following the events of 88 or 69 B.C.), it was rearranged as a workshop: two furnaces and a sand- pit were constructed in the oecus major. The season's finds include a hoard of 13 Attic tetradrachms (olive wreath reverse). Supplementary tests down to the rock in the Insula of the Jewels established that beneath the houses exposed by the excavations are the remains of earlier habitations. On Rhenea, Siebert and Couilloud explored a cistern complex on the terrace overlooking the 'Kato Guenerale' beach from the west. This includes a public fountain and a terrace with an altar and was connected, by an alley paved with a mosaic, with buildings not yet examined, and by a stairway with the beach. Coins and stamped amphora handles indicate use towards the end of the second century B.C. Nearby, in front of an apsidal construction, a group of stelai was found, five of them inscribed, and further south another cistern between retaining walls of Cyclopean con- struction. Syros. The re-examination (in 1962) by Eva- Maria Bossert of the prehistoric remains excavated at Kastri near Chalandriani by Tsountas (AE 1899, 77 ff., I 15 if.) bore fruit in the shape of a new plan of the fortified hill-top settlement and, from room I I,</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 19 a group of bronze tools, a fragment of a clay crucible and a quantity of charcoal mixed with sherds.

The pottery, which includes new examples of the Trojan depas and jugs with cutaway necks of Aegean types, confirms Caskey's equation of Kastri with EH II (Essays in Memory of Karl Lehmann 63 ff.). Naxos. Resuming his investigations of the Myce- naean settlement (AR 1965-66 17), N. Kondoleon (A.S.) secured new evidence dating its floruit early in the thirteenth century B.C. Under a stone fallen on the floor of house B were found fragments of a vase with spiral decoration of the later phase of LH IIIA. Successive overlying structures sealed below a hard floor of the Geometric period indicate intermittent, if not continuous occupation of the site. The remains of the early Hellenistic Stoa, forming the east side of the 'Agora', were further explored FIG. 28 so far as the overlying houses and road permitted. North of the road and close to the sea, Kondoleon also explored a foundation, well-constructed but differently aligned, of what may be the back wall of a separate Stoa fronting the same area. Keros. Many fragments of Early Cycladic marble vases and idols were found in excavations in 1967 together with a complete female figure 0 58 m. high (Fig. 28). In addition, Mrs F. Zapheiro- poulou reports the presence of fragments of bases cut in one piece of marble with the figures that stood on them, sometimes two or more figures, probably male, on one base (AAA I, 97 ff-). FIG. 29 Thera. The centenary of the discovery in 1867 that important remains were buried by a great eruption of the volcano was marked by new investi- gations of great promise, conducted by S. Marinatos (A.S.). His American associates, Miss E. Ralph and J. Mavor, brought scientific equipment to bear, but it was by conventional excavation methods that the best results were obtained, in two trials to the south of Akrotiri village, in which Emily Vermeule and N. Schl6bcke also participated. In the Bronos property, the first test struck what was evidently the upper storey of a building of squared stone, and yielded pithos fragments with grey-painted decora- tion and two typical Minoan sherds of LM IA style. A second trench, in the Arvanitis property, revealed a ground floor store-room with many painted pithoi in position (Fig. 2g) belonging to a large ashlar building of palatial character, preserved in places up to the upper floor, where fragments of painted plaster were recovered. In the store-room a hearth, stone mortars and numerous clay loom-weights were found; also apart from the pithoi, many other decorated vases (Fig. 30). Marinatos observed that seismic shocks, which in some cases threw down the upper floors, preceded the rain of volcanic ash and, more surprising, that some of the structures found were constructed on top of a deposit of this ash. The accidental discovery at Perissa (in 1961) of an amphora of the 'linear island style' has led to a review of the whole class by Miss A. Lebesi, who</page><page sequence="18">20 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 30 while underlining Naxian connexions stops short of a definite attribution. The new vase, which is an early example, has a panel with a pair of grazing horses on the front (Fig. 31), and two bird panels on the back (ADelt 22 Mel 1 2 ff.). OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Thasos. Three sites were examined in 1967 by O. Picard of the French School at the request of the Greek Archaeological Service, but only one produced FIG. 31 important results. This lies about Ioo m. south of the Herakleion on the street of the Silen Gate (Apos- tolides property). Below an Early Byzantine paved street and connected walls, two levels with house remains of the seventh century B.c. were found. In the upper level these included a central room with a hearth and walls standing to a height of over I 20 m. in places. A partial destruction was followed by rebuilding around 525 B.c. Below, scant remains of mid-seventh century date were found. Samothrace. Further supplementary excavations in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods were carried out in 1967 by New York University for the American School, under the direction of J. R. McCredie. On either side of the Propylon of Ptolemy II the channels connecting with the tunnel passing through its foundation were exposed. It was established that this was the only water-course through the gulley in antiquity, and that originally a broad ramp with an inclined marble balustrade connected the Propylon with the circular court on the Eastern Hill. North of the Propylon foundation, in addition to blocks from its superstructure, were found fragments of Corinthian columns, pilaster capitals and foundation blocks from a contemporary building not yet located. On the Eastern Hill, the steps which surround the circular court were found to have been inter- rupted in their first state, by a passage leading to the main buildings of the sanctuary. But the circle had been completed and the outer steps added when the adjoining building with painted stucco walls was erected, probably by the early fourth century. West of the Doric edifice of Philip III and Alexander IV, which replaced that building, the discovery of fragments of Ionic capitals has established the order of its porch. Here also was found a stepped ramp, which provides the first evidence for the final route used by visitors to the sanctuary and explains the marble propylon at the northeast corner of the temenos. In the Byzantine fort on the Western Hill, now datable to the tenth century by coin finds, garrison quarters of dry walling have been identified against the north and west walls and trenching has located Hellenistic and Classical structures as well. North of the fort and west of Building A, the foundation of another building was partly exposed, apparently prostyle or amphiprostyle and, to judge by its orientation, anterior to the rehabilitation of the sanctuary in the Hellenistic period. Among un- associated finds from the dumps of previous excavators is a left hand of Parian marble which may well belong to the Nike of Samothrace in view of its scale and style. Lesbos. The remains of the pseudo-dipteral Ionic temple at Mesa, excavated in the eighties by Kolde- way, have been cleared by V. Petrakos (A.S.). He also excavated the much-destroyed west end for the first time. In the covering soil a hoard of 40 gold ducats of Andrea Dandolo (1343-1354) was found. South of the surviving foundations, stylobate blocks, bases, drums and sections of the stone sima were uncovered.</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 21 Samos. A further campaign in 1967 has enabled U. Jantzen to conclude that the principal remains previously uncovered in the Kastro at Tigani belong to a single building of palatial character and Hel- lenistic date. Its remains are grouped round two peristyle courts, from which elements of an ornate Corinthian order have survived. Rearrangements in the Roman period are attested by the introduction of elaborate water installations. The basilica which was subsequently erected over the northern part of the site is datable to the second half of the fifth century. Below the Hellenistic level, apart from isolated Classical and Archaic structures, a pre- historic stratum was found, the finds from which attest occupation of the site as early as the Neolithic period. Study of the remains of the ancient city outside the Kastro has included surface cleaning of the 'Dontia', a building of Justinian's time to judge by its construction. It appears to have been a vaulted hall with four piers on either side, the remains of which were later incorporated in a Byzantine church. Cos. L. Morricone has now published the contents of the 84 tombs excavated by him between 1935 and 1943 in the adjoining Late Bronze Age cemeteries at 'Eleona' and 'Langada' on the outskirts of the town. The vases range from IIIA to IIIC and were ac- companied by a number of bronze weapons (Annuario 43-44, 5 ff.). A. Orlandos has published a full account of the basilica which he excavated at Mastichari. It preserves the greater part of its mosaic floors, datable around A.D. 5oo, both in the church itself and in the baptistery and diaconicon which flank it. In- scriptions give the names of the dedicants of in- dividual sections. A series of panels with running animals in the north aisle are more Justinianic in style, but were doubtless completed before the disastrous earthquake of 554 (AE 1966, 4 ff.). CRETE Herakleion. An important rock-cut tomb of MM III-LM I date with three pillars and a stepped dromos, which was exposed by building operations in the Poros quarter, has been excavated by Miss A. Lembesi (A.S.). One recess contained pottery rather earlier than the remainder, including several cups decorated with white lilies dating from the MM IIIA phase. With the pottery from the main chamber were found 5 sealstones of various types, a number of cylinder seals, some jewellery including a finger-ring with a cloisonne enamel bezel, a ritual stone hammer-axe and the remains of a wooden litter with bronze fastenings. Knossos. Sir Arthur Evans's Knossos Fresco Atlas, a portfolio of 19 colour plates printed during his lifetime, was issued in 1967 (Gregg Press Ltd.) with an introductory Catalogue by M. Cameron and S. Hood. 28 of the fragments from the Palace in- cluded here have not hitherto been published and three of them cannot now be traced. With M. R. Popham in general charge, the British School has undertaken a new excavation at Knossos, in the area of the 'Unexplored Mansion'. Such of this Minoan building as was exposed during Evans's excavation of the adjoining Little Palace was seen to be covered by a substantial destruction deposit, which promised new evidence for the date of the main destruction at Knossos. The pre- liminary task of studying and removing the later accumulations overlying the Minoan building was started by H. Sackett in 1967, at the north end of the site, where structures of Roman date had been partly exposed by German excavators during the war. The most substantial of these proved to be a house of the second and third centuries A.D., bounded on three sides by narrow streets. Its principal feature was a rectangular area with a central column, probably a partly-roofed court (Fig. 32).

H. S. MEGAW of its abandonment was given by a group of pottery of the Severan period, found close inside the entrance door. This tallies with evidence from the Royal Road area and from Villa Dionysus, suggesting widespread trouble and perhaps temporary aban- donment of the city in the early third century. Earlier Roman structures had been much disturbed when the house was built, but associated with them were several closed deposits of pottery and lamps, the earliest dating from the time of Nero. Isolated finds included a carved bone pin-head representing Aphrodite (Fig. 33). Hellenistic material was also recovered, much of it from fills brought in to level the Roman floors. In the lower strata some Geo- metric pottery was found and, in an ash-layer overlying the Minoan level, two Protogeometric skyphoi. Elsewhere, however, robbing-pits of Geo- metric and Hellenistic date had been sunk deep into the Minoan levels, where good building stone was to be had (Fig. 34, Minoan level at bottom right). The evacuation of the fillings of these pits, which contain mixed Minoan and later material, will be completed in the 1968 campaign, when the un- contaminated Minoan deposits will also be excavated. Several Geometric tombs had been observed in S. Alexiou (A.S.) reports the collection of a female marble statue of the Roman period from 'Kephala' near the sanatorium. Archanes. Resuming excavations in the important Minoan cemetery on Phourni hill, I. Sakellarakis (A.S.) has further investigated the building enclosing tholos tomb B found in 1966. The room with a central pillar to the south of the tholos had been looted but yielded a gold ring with a goddess and griffon intaglio on the bezel and a steatite seal in the shape of a bull's head. Below the floor, remains of earlier walls and paving were found to extend southwards into the area of the stair passage which led to the upper storey of the building enclosing the tholos. The earlier remains date from the period of the first palaces and include a number of larnax burials. Among the associated finds are a unique stone idol with Cycladic and Anatolian connections (Fig. 36) and an ivory seal in the form of a dog with three scorpions on the sealing surface. In building F, a separate tomb-house immediately to the south, partly excavated in 1966, a staircase along the east side and two more ground floor rooms were investigated. These also contained super- imposed layers of burials somewhat disturbed.

Survey of the Knossos Area no. 26). The newly observed tombs were excavated on behalf of the Service by N. Coldstream of the British School, in September 1967. All nine tombs identified had been plundered, some as early as Roman times; but a good deal of pottery was recovered. A Sub-Minoan amphora and stirrup jar are noteworthy in that they are slightly earlier than the oldest vases previously recorded from the Fortetsa area (Fig. 35).</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 23 monographs.1 The pottery will be published in a separate volume. Phaistos. The new excavations of the Italian School started by D. Levi in 1950 were rounded off in the campaign of 1966 (see AR 1966-67 20 ff.). He has now reviewed the work done and set out his conclusions (Annuario 43-44, 313 ff-). Ayios Kyrillos (Mesara). At 'Akonaki' south of Ayios Kyrillos, Sakellarakis (A.S.) has excavated a plundered tholos tomb with an elaborate arrangement of antechambers (Fig. 37). The one containing the entrance to the tholos was used for burials, that adjoining it as an ossuary and the remainder for offerings. These included many stone bowls of the usual Mesara types, a figurine of a male votary, a bull rhyton, beads and two sealstones. These date the use of the tomb to the close of the pre- palatial period (AAA i, 50 ff.). Kalami (Viannos). S. Alexiou (A.S.) has in- vestigated tombs and pithos burials by the chapel of Ayia Paraskevi close to the sea in the 'Phaphlinkou' valley, where an MM III kernos and an LM IIIA kylix were salvaged in 1966. On 'Trapeza' hill to the west a settlement site was identified with pottery ranging from MM IB to LM I, and a second extending to LM IIIA at 'Psari Phorada' to the east. Malia. The French School's 1967 excavations were concentrated on the large Protopalatial building discovered by J. C. Poursat west of sector Delta in the previous campaign. An area of some 700 square metres has now been uncovered without finding its limits. On the west side a series of basement rooms reached by a staircase from a small stuccoed court has been found, their walls preserved almost to their full height. In one of two store- rooms with low platforms along the walls, two pithoi FIG. 36 Finds here included more ivory seals (two with hieroglyphic signs) and fragments of plaster horns of consecration and offering tables. In building E, to the west of r and only partly excavated, were found numerous skulls in pithoi as well as larnakes deposited early in the period of the first palaces. Here, unlike the ossuary found in 1965 (IT), there were few important associ- ated offerings apart from a Near Eastern cylinder seal of lapis lazuli. For earlier finds from the cemetery see now Archaeology 20, 276 ff. Phinikia (Herakleion). At 'Drakou- li~tri' Alexiou (A.S.) has excavated a small early Protogeometric chamber tomb containing a pithos cremation with two hemispherical bronze bowls and weapons of bronze and iron.

Objects fallen from the upper storey include a dagger with gold plated hilt decorated with open work, a clay impression from a hiero- glyphic seal and a 'Chamaizi' vase with an incised inscription. A second of these vases, with a painted inscription, and an inscribed pithos were found in the east sector of the excavation. Lato. Clearance in and around the temple on the terrace to the south of the Agora (cf. BCH 1901, pl. xx) was undertaken by the French School in 1967 (Fig. 38). The walls, standing to a maximum height of 3'35 m., have an outer face of bossed almost everywhere: in all about 250 whole or res- torable vessels. Apart from Vassilike ware, the mottled black and red pottery named after the only considerable settlement of the period previously excavated, a series of large jugs of a buff ware with black linear decoration are noteworthy (Fig. 39), for this particular technique is very rare in EM II. There are also large storage jars with vertical dribbles of black paint (Fig. 4o). In general, the shapes and systems of decoration represented suggest a strong continuity from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age in Crete. FIG. 38 blocks in regular courses backed by smaller blocks forming a polygonal inner face. The temple is divided into pronaos and cella, where stands a podium of two courses, the upper moulded. The floor is of pebbles set in white plaster. There is only one block from the superstructure, from the angle of a pediment, but there are numerous fragments of tiles and cover-tiles of Corinthian type. Sherds from the terrace fill indicate a date possibly as late as the mid-second century B.c. Myrtos. In the summer of 1967, P. Warren conducted a first campaign of excavations sponsored by the British School at 'Fournou Korifi' on the coast between Ierapetra and Myrtos, where an Early Minoan hill settlement had been observed in 1962 by Hood, Cadogan and Warren (BSA 59, 95). Much of the summit of the hill was cleared, revealing some 40 small rooms evidently belonging to a single building. This was occupied exclusively during the EM II period, destroyed by fire and never rebuilt. Much of its equipment was found in situ, making it possible to identify some rooms as stores and others as workshops possibly connected with a textile industry. Areas of plaster were found in position on some of the walls and there is evidence that in some cases it was painted red or brown. Beneath the destruction debris deposits of vases were found Exceptional for this early period was the finding of three stamp seals: two of serpentine, one of them with a linear device (Fig. 4x), and one unfinished, of a material available locally. There is also a clay FIG. 39</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1967-68 25 found. Samples of charcoal were collected for radiocarbon dating, the first to be submitted to this process from an Early Bronze Age context in Crete. Kato Zakro. Several peripheral areas of the Minoan palace were uncovered in a further campaign by N. Platon (A.S. with support from Leon and Harriet Pomerance). On the southeast (plan in AR 1965-66 fig. 44), beyond the unit containing the circular tank, a further unit, probably an open area, established the continuation of the palace towards the sea, though in parts preserved only at foundation level. Here, in the layer below the floor was found a bath tub and other remains be- longing to the earlier phase (MM IIIB-LM IA). Northeast of this area the seaward limit of the paved court was found, as well as the main entrance to it: a stepped ramp between massive walls descending from the higher ground to the northeast. Platon also completed his investigation of the earlier strata underlying the block of basement rooms which close the main court on the southwest. The broad passages flanking this block on the south- west and northwest sides, by which the court was entered, were also fully exposed. Beneath their floors (largely destroyed), fragmentary pottery and stone vases datable to the MM IIIB-LM IA phase were found in an underlying deposit. More was exposed of the remains of this phase, terraced up the hill-side to the north of the central court, in an area which was unoccupied by the reconstructed palace. Here, the small rooms of the first palace contained some rich pottery deposits, in certain cases superimposed. The rooms were found to end against a long wall, differently aligned, belonging to a building higher up the slope, of which the date is not yet established. In this campaign also were found quantities of pumice and other material believed to be volcanic and lending colour to the view that the destruction of the second palace in the LM IB period was caused by the eruption of Thera. Two burial enclosures were also excavated, close to the road from Ano Zakro at 'Pezo'lles Kephalas', both in use at the close of the prepalatial period. ... .... .......i.i..i ............ ......... . : i i i i i ii :: :i'ii~i;:i i::i'i ,i~i ---::i::i,ii~i:ii~iiiiii!iii~ ... ii!!iiliiiiii!;I : - : : I-:-i!-i _ .-: :.:.: iiiiiiiiii~iiiL' i i iii ,! ! !i iii~!!iii ii i~iii iii'iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ...............................................................:.............

From a looted cemetery at 'Ailia', Alexiou secured (in 1964) for the Rethymno Museum a bronze cuirass in good condition datable to the sixth century B.c. A complete bronze mitra inscribed in the Archaic Cretan alphabet with the name O KAAANOXL (Fig. 42) comes from the same site (ADelt 20 Chr 554). This is very similar to a mitra from Axos in the Yiamalakis collection, likewise inscribed with the name of a dedicant, which Marinatos has lately published (AE 1966, 104 if.). Other examples from Crete were included in the recent loan exhibition of 'Master Bronzes from the Classical World' at the Fogg Art Museum, one embossed with a pair of sphinxes wearing tall poloi (Archaeology 21, 7 and cover).
