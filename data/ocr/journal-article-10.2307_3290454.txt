Dunn, University of Oregon, Eugene, Ore. This department will present everything that is properly news of general appeal, but considerations of space compel the editor to ask that items be made as brief as possible. Whenever feasible, it is preferable to print programs of meetings which would draw an attendance from a large area as live news in advance of the date rather than as dead news after the event. In this connection it should be remembered that the December issue, e.g., appears on November fifteenth and that items must be in hand five or six weeks in advance of this date.] Athens The fourth campaign of the American School and the Greek govern- ment is under way in five different sectors of the Athenian Agora. The Managing Committee is now receiving weekly reports from Dr. Shear, Field Director of the big dig. All sorts of interesting things are coming to light. Among the 165 recently discovered inscriptions is an additional piece of the famous auction list of the effects of Alcibiades - tables, armchairs, et cetera, with the prices at which they were knocked down. Another supplies the long-desired name of the archon of 176 B.C., Speusippus. Still another gives us the name of Dionysius as archon in 128-7. Quantities of pottery, whole vases and sherds, ranging from Myce- naean to Roman are constantly coming to light. Interesting sculptures, too, are among the finds - notably a late fifth or early fourth century marble group of two girls, one carrying the other on her back. A torrential rain and a heavy fall of snow lasting through a day and a half interfered with the work for some time in February. The most important discoveries of this season are foundations that evidently belonged to the Tholus (the round building where the 635</page><page sequence="2">636 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Prytanes dined every day and where the preliminary examination of Socrates before his trial was held) and the Metroum (the temple of the Mother of the Gods). These two interesting buildings are now definitely located just to the south of the old excavation in front of the "Theseum," considerably farther to the north than any one had hitherto calculated. This discovery necessitates a complete revision of the identi- fication of all the buildings already named: The "Theseum" is apparently neither Theseum nor Hephaesteum; the "Royal Stoa" is almost surely not the Royal Stoa. This apparently must be sought north of the electric railway. A suggestion of the magnitude of the undertaking may be given in the fact that in the first three weeks of this year, in spite of the handi- caps of unfavorable weather, 11,375 cartloads of earth have been re- moved, and 1513 coins added to the thousands already rescued from the accumulations of centuries. Corinth Invitations for the formal opening of the new Museum at Corinth have been issued by the Trustees of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The building is the gift of Mrs. William H. Moore of New York. The dedication will take place at Old Corinth on April 30, 1934. With the fine new home for the American excavators, provided a few years ago through the generosity of Mr. Horace Oakley of Chicago, and this really magnificent new Museum, a worthy home for the rich finds at Corinth, the old city at the Isthmus will become an ever more and more attractive place of pilgrimage for tourists and scholars.

Francis Curran, Putnam High School, Putnam, Conn. Mississippi Last March the Mississippi Classical Association sponsored a Latin tournament which proved very successful in its beginning year. The word "tournament" is probably a misnomer, as it was really a state-wide testing project. Over eleven hundred pupils took the tests in their own classrooms under the supervision of their teachers. The papers were graded by the teachers, and the best papers were sent to the college teachers who did the final grading. The Tupelo High School won three first places; Gulfport High School won one first place. The average rat-</page><page sequence="4">638 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL ing of the first-year Latin pupils was 70, the second year 71, the Cicero pupils 75.8, the Vergil 83.1. These averages were made out by the pres- ident of the association, to whom the teachers reported all grades. On account of the differences in grading the averages are not entirely accurate. They did, however, give an approximate standard. The teachers reported their grades with considerable fidelity. One teacher reported an entire department in which no student passed. This teacher wrote that the tests had made her realize what she lacked as a teacher and that she intended to study in the summer before facing her classes another year. Her letter alone is evidence of the success of the project. All types of schools were represented in the tournament: public high schools in the larger and smaller towns, private schools, consolidated schools, and agricultural high schools. Because of financial conditions throughout the state no large awards could be given. The chapter of Eta Sigma Phi at Mississippi State College for Women offered to provide the cost of matriculation for the fourth-year girl ranking highest. The tournament was directed and inspired by Martha Frances Allen, Instructor in Latin at All Saints College, Vicksburg. The Latin Depart- ment of the University of Mississippi secured the interest of the Italian Government, which presented a gold medal to the highest ranking pupil in the Vergil contest. Under the direction of Edwina Ford, Latin Instructor, North Missis- sippi Synodical College, and President of the State Classical Association, active preparations are being made for the 1934 tournament. Greensboro, North Carolina The college professors of Latin and Greek in the state met on January sixth at Woman's College, University of North Carolina, in Greensboro. Among the points of interest discussed in the meeting these were the most outstanding: the enrollment in Latin classes in the high schools and colleges of the state; the introduction of beginning Latin in the col- lege curriculum. The latter was unanimously approved, and it was agreed that there should be a clearer understanding of policies and points of view between the colleges and the high schools of the state and be- tween the colleges and the State Department of Education. The group decided that a committee should be appointed to confer with the North Carolina College Conference and with the State Department of Educa- tion with regard to policies affecting Latin in the high school. It is hoped that with the proper interest aroused the meeting may result in something significant not only for Latin but for language teach- ing in general in North Carolina.</page></plain_text>
