Research has attributed this to many science teachers using these ideas themselves (Tan and Taber, in J Chem Educ 86(5):623-629, 2009). This research extends this work by considering which atomic models are used in pre-service teachers' explanations and how that relates to the causality ideas expressed. Thirty-one pre-service teachers were interviewed. Each was asked to describe and explain four different atomic representations (Rutherford, Electron cloud micrograph, Bohr and Schrödinger types) in as much detail as they could. They also provided an explanation for the subsequent ionisation energy values for an oxygen atom and identified which representations were helpful in explaining the values. Significantly, when pre- service teachers only used Bohr type representations, they did not use repelling electron ideas in their explanations. However, arguments that were based on electron-electron repulsion used features from Schrödinger type atoms. These findings suggest that many pre-service teachers need to develop their atomic modelling skills so that they select and use models more expertly and that subsequent ionisa- tion explanations offer a context in which to explore dif- ferent atomic models' limitations and their deployment as explanatory resources. Introduction Effective teachers have good subject matter knowledge, which they can transform into teaching and learning activities. In chemical education, such subject knowledge would result in the ability to offer explanations which provide causal links between observed phenomena and abstract sub-microscopic agents. In order to do this, teachers need to evaluate and select different atomic models so to provide appropriately convincing explana- tions for the phenomena considered (Driver et al. 2000). Thus simplistic sphere collisions can account for pressure changes in ideal gases, but Schrödinger type atoms provide explanatory resources for emission spectra. Such 'expert' modelling skills, allowing this selection can be problematic for two reasons. Firstly, the develop- ment of an understanding of the usefulness of more com- plex atomic models is itself difficult. Particularly the transition from Bohr electronic arrangements to a proba- bilistic mathematical solution of the Schrödinger' s wave equation demands a radical change in ideas. A marked rise in the complexity of the structure of the atom is accom- panied by an ontological shift: electrons as both particles and waves from particulate electrons moving in fixed tra- jectories (Papaphotis and Tsaparlis 2008a, b; Treagust and Duit 2008). However, it is this radical change that allows the development of a more powerful conceptual framework which provides the resources for more detailed explana- tions (Pintrich et al. 1993). Secondly, chemistry explanations need to reflect the three levels used for viewing behaviours; the macroscopic observable, particulate and symbolic representational. Good explanations are ones that move between and relate across these levels via causation arguments (Sevian and Gonzales 2008). This requires the identification of the most Keywords Pre-service teachers • Ionisation energy • Atomic models R.

In the case of ionisation energy explanations, complex electrostatic interactions are required when accounting for changes in subsequent ioni- sation energy values due to shielding effects (Taber and Tan 2007). These complex interactions often result in alternate causal ideas being offered. This research, focusing on the connection between the atomic models drawn upon and the explanatory arguments formed aims to identify the models that offer resources for particular arguments that are given in explanations. Ini- tially I will consider an explanation of ionisation energy values suitable for advanced level chemistry courses in order to note the interlinked concepts of electrostatics and atomic structure that are needed to form causal arguments. Secondly I will describe the alternative ideas used in explanations of ionisation energy and the difficulties with using atomic models, before considering their intercon- nection in the research presented. An Explanation for Trends in Ionisation Energy Values Definition: Ionisation energy is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous species forms one mole of gaseous ions by removing one electron from each species. It is an endothermic process, i.e. AH is positive. A general equation for this enthalpy change for the first ionisation energy for any element is: X(g) -* X+(g) + e~ Generally, any ionisation energy is the enthalpy change for the nth ionisation process: X'n-1'+(g) - » Xn+(g) +e~ Trends in ionisation energy values can be used to consider electron configurations or vice versa by relating the energy required to remove electrons from atoms or cations of particular elements. This system of nuclei and electrons is held together by electrical forces which together minimise the energy of the system, but quantization restricts the possible configurations. The energy required to remove an electron from these systems depends on three factors: Firstly the mutual electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron. According to Coulomb's law, the magnitude of this attraction depends on the positive nuclear charge which is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus and the distance of the electron from the nucleus. The larger the nuclear charge the greater the attraction between the electron and the nucleus and so the greater the energy required to remove the electron. The distance from the nucleus affects the force of attraction in an inverse square relationship; such that this attraction weakens rapidly as the electron-nucleus distance increases. The second factor is called shielding and occurs when there are electro-magnetic interactions between outer elec- trons and those nearer the nucleus. This causes a significant reduction in the amount of energy needed to remove these 'shielded' electrons, due to the repulsion of inner electrons offsetting the attraction from the nucleus. Furthermore as the outer electrons' distribution is controlled by their mutual repulsion, the greater the number of electrons, the greater their average distance from the nucleus. Thirdly a minor effect occurs when electrons of opposite spin occupy the same orbital space. This repulsion is much smaller but does allow one of these paired electrons to be removed more easily than an unpaired one at a similar distance from the nucleus (Cann 2000). A further compli- cation is that the distance that electron charge properties can be considered to be acting in an orbital is at a proba- bilistic average based on Schrödinger' s solutions of the wave equation for an electron in a hydrogen atom. In order to account for variations in ionisation energies between elements and for subsequent ionisation value trends, these factors need to be weighed against each other drawing on knowledge of electronic structure. Given the complexity of such explanations it is unsurprising that research has identified many alternative ideas which I summarise below. Alternative Ideas Used in Explanations of Ionisation Energy Explanations of ionisation energy often use heuristic causal ideas; stability arising from Octet configurations and non- consensus electrostatic concepts, when the nucleus can share out its attraction over the electrons present. Such ideas are frequently expressed alongside consensus scien- tific conceptions regarding the factors effecting the attraction between nucleus and electron (Taber 2005; Taber and Tan 2007; Tan et al. 2005, 2008). Tan and Taber (2009) identify teaching as a possible source of alternative ideas as many pre-service chemistry teachers similarly use these causality ideas in their explanations. The alternate ideas they noted are summarised in Table 1. The Octet rule framework (Taber 2009) uses ideas about stability, such that full shells are more stable than other configurations and so account for much higher ionisation energies for removal of electrons from full shells, as occurs when removing the electron from a Sodium ion (Na+) (second subsequent ionisation) compared to removing the first from a sodium atom. This is unsurprising as teachers often draw on the Octet rule as a rule of thumb to account for chemical reactions between elements by forming ions or molecules via Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 405 Table 1 Summary of the common non-scientific conceptions used in explaining ionisation energy trends drawn from Tan et al. (2008) Conception Characteristics Octet rule framework Noble gas configuration ions do not recombine with electrons to form atoms as octet is stable. Ionisation energy values for removal of electrons from full octet are very high due to the stability of the Octet Stable fully filled or half filled Ionisation energy values are greater if electrons need to be removed from full or half-full sub shells, because sub shells these are more stable Conservation of force (Charge Nuclear charge is shared between electrons, such that if one is removed the charge is re-distributed, increasing sharing) energy for subsequent ionisations Relation- based reasoning Considers only one relational aspect to explain ionisation energy trends, e.g. distance from the nucleus electron exchange or sharing that results in a full outer shell of electrons for each atom involved (Coll and Taylor 2002). Stable, fully filled shell or half filled sub shell ideas are an extension of the Octet rule. Furthermore teachers and text books commonly use stability of half filled or filled sub shells to account for anomalies in general trends in ionisation energies (Tan et al. 2005). The third alternative idea used to explain ionisation energy values is that of 'Conservation of force' which, although drawing on the idea of the interaction of charges, also assumes that the force due to the nuclear charge is shared between the electrons it can act on. Here the protons in the nucleus attract one electron each so that, if one electron is removed from an atom, the nuclear charge is then shared out over the remaining electrons, so attracting them more (Taber 2002). This is often used to account for the gradual increase in subsequent ionisation energies. Finally, the relation-based reasoning seems to stem directly from the issue of the complexity of ionisation energy explanations. Commonly these alternate ideas are expressed alongside ones which follow Coulomb's law. This suggests that several explanatory approaches are being used and selected according to the question context (Taber and Watts 1996). The conceptual development of these ideas seem to have the hallmarks of Posner et al.'s (1982) 'assimilation', with special cases created as needed rather than a coherent framework of ideas drawing on electrostatic principles applied to the atom. The complexity of the arguments needed to explain ionisation energy may arise from two sources. Firstly, students must identify all the relevant factors and secondly, they need to weigh them against each other. The scatter of use of different concepts to answer related questions, as noted above, seems to indicate that selection of relevant factors is contextually driven and may arise from prior experience of using this factor to explain correctly. As Tan and Taber' s (2009) study of pre-service teach- ers' ideas about ionisation energy in Singapore revealed that they held the same conceptions as their students it seems these ideas are likely to be explicitly or implicitly passed on through teaching. If ionisation explanations require difficult complex reasoning involving competing electrostatic interactions then how much more complex this reasoning must be when it is applied to the abstract atom, itself identified as trou- blesome for many (Park and Light 2009). Atomic Models A definition of model that fits well with this term's usage in this paper is that of an idea produced for the purpose of providing an explanation of an entity which allows suc- cessful prediction how it will behave (Gilbert et al. 2000). Such models are produced in an individual's mind, as mental models, allowing visualisation of structures and behaviours given defined conditions. When these mental models are communicated to others verbally or visually they then become expressed models. When expressed models become accepted by the scientific community as explanatory resources then they are often termed consensus models (Gilbert 2005). Simple atomic models based on Rutherford's/Bohr's consensus models are commonly used in science education. An example is the solar system analogical atom. The more familiar solar system relies on the effects of non-contact forces. These Rutherford/Bohr solar system hybrid models are used as they are simple and the analogy allows students to use their prior knowledge to construct a mental image that should allow explanations of many observed phe- nomena. For example, Rutherford/Bohr models can be used to explain patterns of reactivity in the periodic table and so connect electronic configuration to chemical properties (Justi and Gilbert 2000). One issue with using such atomic models to support explanations is that the aspects of the model's features that support the explanation often need to be focussed upon selectively. This requires an appreciation of models as themselves being selected for these attributes rather than because the model demonstrates a literal copy of the atom (Grosslight et al. 1991). Papaphotis and Tsaparlis (2008a, b) attribute students' difficulties with quantum electron models as due to their highly abstract mathematical nature. Students often fail to 4^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">406 J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 recognise the need for these difficult conceptions as their prior models seem to be satisfactory. Quantum orbitais are introduced after Bohr type models have been used effec- tively over a sustained period by students. Before the new model can be readily adopted they need to find this embedded one unsatisfactory. Tsaparlis and Papaphotis (2009) found that even after undergraduate studies of quantum atomic models students still prefer to use hybrid Bohr models, with particulate electrons occupying clouds arranged in shells around the nucleus. This preference for 'particulate' electrons in Rutherford/Bohr atoms has simi- larly been determined when students are asked to draw atoms or select diagrams to represent them. For example, 16 year old Swedish students usually draw Bohr type atoms (Adbo and Taber 2009). Kalkanis et al. (2003) found undergraduates describe orbitais as a 'probability space' for electrons, despite drawing representations that rather show electrons as having definite locations and trajectories. However, as orbital representations are more difficult to draw, the preference for drawing simpler diagrams may be a reflection of the task rather than the mental model that the student prefers. Atomic Models as Resources for Ionisation Energy Explanations Forming causal arguments for different aspects of ionisa- tion energy trends requires appropriate selection of atomic models as 'fit for purpose' (Coll et al. 2005). This expert use of models selects the resource most appropriate for the different arguments needed to account for different aspects of the explanation. For example, when the distance from the nucleus is the dominant factor in determining the change in ionisation energy value, selection of a model that represents this change in distance between nucleus and electron is needed. So visualising different shells in a Rutherford/Bohr hybrid atom might prove helpful. How- ever when accounting for the change in energy required for removing a paired verses unpaired electron, then visualis- ing the atom as one with electrons occupying more space when paired would support this argument. Thus an orbital model showing probability space might offer a suitable resource in this case. In this research, I use the expressed atomic models that pre-service teachers use when forming ionisation energy explanations to consider their visualisation of atoms and hence the explanatory resources different models afford them. Given that pre-service teachers' mental models shape their explanations to their students and hence the formation of these students' own mental models, this offers a win- dow on future chemistry students' use of atomic models (Valanides and Angeli 2006). Methodology In order to elicit pre-service teachers' ideas about ionisa- tion energy and particularly to explore the connection between their ideas about atomic structure and their explanations, semi-structured interviews were used. These provided a standardised set of questions to allow compa- rability (LeCompte and Preissle 1993), but also allowed probing and clarification of the subtleties of the complex ideas expressed. Interview responses were analysed to characterise the types of explanations and the types of atomic models used. Categories emerged from the data. These are discussed in detail below: Interviews Individual interviews of approximately 25 min each were conducted using three semi-structured protocols. The first set of interviews was conducted from October 2008 to May 2009. These interview protocols consisted of questions probing three areas: 1 . A graph showing the variation in subsequent ionisation energy values for an oxygen atom was used to elicit an explanation for the variations (Fig. 1). 2. Atomic representation diagrams ((A) Rutherford type (Scott 2002), (B) Electron cloud micrograph (Univer- sity of Alberta, no date), (C) Bohr type (How Stuff Works 2001) and (D) Schrödinger type (Jones 1996)) were used as stimulus materials to explore the pre- service teachers' ideas about the atom and these representations of it. This allowed the pre-service teachers' use of the key terms; orbital, shell and energy level, to be clarified in relation to the atomic model features represented. The actual diagrams used were colour figures showing the same features as those in the sketches (Fig. 2). 3. Pre-service teachers were asked to indicate which representations were useful for their explanations and how they were helpful. The question order was randomly reversed regarding ionisation energy explanations and atomic representations to determine if considering atomic models before explaining ionisation energy values affected the explanations. The representations А, В, С and D were selected as they offer features of a Rutherford (planetary) type model, an electron cloud presentation, Bohr shells type model and representations of orbitais based on Schrödinger' s equa- tions respectively. These representations were not selected as typical of those that may have been used in advanced chemistry courses as then it would have been more difficult to use the representations to consider the subjects ^ Springer</page><page sequence="5">J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 407 Fig. 1 Ionisation data stimulus material: electronic configuration of an oxygen atom and a chart showing the subsequent ionisation energy values for an oxygen atom 2S 2p Oxygen electron configuration: (He)2 UH 1 nl T 1 T 1 5.5 t 0 1 £ 50 / / £ / / W 4.5 / / k / S 4.0 c 0 *5 3.5 (0 / - 1 3.0 O) O 2.5 • 1 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th ionisation interpretation of them against their own expressed models (Coll et al. 2005). If I had used more standard represen- tations they may simply recall them as an example of a particular historical consensus model and hence recall feature connections. A second set of interviews conducted in February and April 201 1 used the above interview structure, except that these subjects were asked to sketch and explain any visualisations that they drew upon after their initial explanation of the ionisation trends. A combination of their description of model features from representations and from drawings of visualised atoms used when forming explanations, was to provide a multimodal (verbal, visual and in some cases' gestural) representation of their ideas. Farland and McComas (2007, as cited in Cheng and Gilbert 2009) found that asking children for single representations, drawings of scientists, resulted in the drawing of stereo- typical images, but when they asked for multiple images, other views were expressed. Therefore in this study the multimodal approach may provide additional reliability in considering the expressed models used (Cheng and Gilbert 2009). Background data regarding the pre-service teachers' education were also collected. Sample The pre-service secondary (high school) science teachers readily volunteered to participate in the study in response to an email request. This convenience sample was made known to me via my role as either their tutor or science education lecturer. The sample for the first set of interviews consisted of 16 chemistry specialist pre-service science Fig. 2 Sketches showing the main features of the atomic representation diagrams used as interview stimulus materials ® Springer</page><page sequence="6">408 J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 teachers, seven biology and one physics specialist. The second interview sample similarly consisted of 7 pre-ser- vice secondary science teachers all of whom were training to be chemistry teachers. All had studied chemistry at an advanced level. They would have had experience of using Rutherford/Bohr and Schrödinger type models and have sufficient chemical knowledge to form causal arguments for variations in ionisation energy values. These convenience samples were advantageous as they enabled a 100% response rate and so ensured that sample size did not diminish, however this limits generalisability to similar samples only. Data Analysis Interviews were audio recorded and detailed contempora- neous notes taken in order to record gestures (hand waving and pointing) that further enable meanings to be gleaned, without the distraction of a video camera. This also allowed the interviewer to accurately reflect back answers to allow further elaboration and clarification. Following the interview the contemporaneous notes were the edited, adding detail when the notes did not clearly convey the same connections of ideas as gleaned from the audio recording. As these edited contemporaneous notes (edited notes) were extensive and included gestures, they were used to identify the atomic features used in different types of explanatory argument. The edited notes (and initial transcripts) were analysed for key words that linked effect to cause and features to atomic models. A more detailed description follows below. After approximately 10 interviews, three randomly selected recordings were fully transcribed and the explan- atory themes and model features used in them and the pre- service teachers' selection of model identified by the researcher were verified by an experienced advanced level chemistry teacher (teacher 1). Then transcriptions were coded both by the researcher and by another advanced level chemistry teacher (teacher 2). The edited notes were also coded. The same causality arguments and atomic model features were identified in each case and only minor dif- ferences in key word coding were identified. This similarity in coding indicated that transcription did not offer addi- tional reliability and henceforth the edited notes served as the primary data sources. Table 2 shows the explanations identified and the codes noted by researcher and teachers 1 and 2. Full coding details are provided in "Appendix". Interpreting the Data Content analysis of the data looked for the consistent use of key words that demonstrated energy level, space distribution (distance from nucleus), and/or repulsion and attraction concepts being applied to electrons in atomic structures in order to form causality arguments. For example, when describing the effect of distance from the nucleus, this could be described as closer or nearer and involve an indirect reference to the nucleus like the core or protons, which would all quite accurately make appropriate similar meanings. So 'close', 'far', 'distance', etc. were all coded 'D' for 'distance' (Fig. 3). Once key terms were identified the inter-relating of these ideas to form explanations was considered. For example, the relating of the variation of electrostatic attraction to the variation of the distance between an electron and the nucleus was noted by the coding for dis- tance (D) and nucleus (N) (together SPD) being connected appropriately with the coding for electrostatic attraction (ESA) (Highlighted Fig. 3). Similarly non-consensus science arguments like the connection of stability with full or partially full orbitais/ shells were coded by key words like stability (STAB) and configuration (CONFIG) (Fig. 4). Explanations were categorised by the causal arguments used. Those that used stability as a causal agent were categorised as those using inappropriate ideas because they do not offer scientific causality without further justification. Arguments that used scientific causal relationships, like the distance between nucleus and electron causing a change in the electrostatic attraction, were placed into the wider category of explanation themes relating scientific ideas. Similarly, the key features of the atomic models repre- sented in the stimulus materials were coded for key terms and ideas that are associated with them (Budde et al. 2002). Use of these key words in descriptions and their usage in explanations were noted ("Appendix"). The meanings gleaned from interviews for terms like shells and orbitais, their usage in describing the stimulus atomic representa- tions as well as the selection of these representations, allowed the type of atomic model being used in explana- tions to be determined. This connection was further con- sidered by the third interview protocol that included sketches of visualisations of atoms which were to further clarify and connect the descriptions of presented repre- sentations and the subjects' use of key terms. Only one explanatory theme identified by the researcher was not identified by teachers 1 and 2 was that of 'Shared charge ideas' described above. After further transcript review and discussions both teachers 1 and 2 agreed that this argument was being used and as such should be coded for. Otherwise interrater reliability is high as shown in Table 2 with the same linkage between key terms to form arguments being identified accept in one case when the explanation ran across a page break in the transcript and thus teacher 2 did not identify the linkage and therefore â Springer</page><page sequence="7">J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 409 ад _c '-6 о о Ч-ч о a о сл 'S а В о U с* v S ев H тз •с S й 2 g С 4_&gt; ИМ Г рз Ü M й ь s q о ! a ^ S &lt; cg S ^ ^ i Z (i e z £ w Й &lt; g rç J H" e h « (i и z w и &lt; 2 Q О H" О V- о .с &lt; ^ Z PQ и.

This was resolved by discussion and the linkage accepted by teacher 2. Limitations The nature of these convenience samples as not necessarily being representative samples needs to be acknowledged. Another issue is that the interview responses given are a 'snap shot' which cannot be assumed to be representative of a pre-service teacher's general thinking. Rather the data are only from that pre-service teacher in that context at that time and what the interviewer interprets from what they choose to communicate to them. Both the interviewer and interviewee have to make meaning from what is experi- enced and communicated. Furthermore as the interviewer was one of the pre-service teachers' course tutors and additionally for some also their personal tutor, she was in a position of power in the relationship. This could strongly influence their responses (Limerick et al. 1996). A coun- termeasure response to this power is for interviewees to say what they think the interviewer wants to hear (Kvale 2006). Rather than uncovering pre-service teachers thinking about atoms and ionisation energies, the ideas noted may be those which they think they ought to use. However, this is the sort of explanation that is likely to be offered to their future students and so is helpful in noting the explanatory resources that may be offered to future chemists. Findings Explanatory Themes From the final coding two categories of explanatory ideas used in explanations were noted: • Inappropriate ideas: Full shell or half full sub-shell stability ideas and 'Shared Charge' ideas. • Relating of scientific ideas: Many pre-service teachers used a number of these types of explanations to describe different aspects of subsequent ionisation energy trends. The extent of each explanatory category and the atomic models drawn upon in arguments is summarised in Table 3. Arguments drawing upon columbic principles are detailed below with examples for each category identified from edited notes coding transcribed below: Those involving attraction: a. Electrostatic attraction effected by spatial distribution of electrons '..This electron is a lot closer to nucleus, therefore there is more attraction, there is more energy required to remove it....' (Pre-service teacher 5CHp2.) b. Shielding related to electrostatic attraction or spatial distribution of electrons 'How far electrons are from the nucleus, more shells there are the further away the outer electron is from the nucleus and they also shielded the nucleus.' [Probe: 'What do you mean by that?'] 'Block its effect on other atoms around it. So if less shells other atoms are more attracted to the nucleus.' (Pre-service teacher 8RCHp2.) Those involving repulsion: a. Electrostatic repulsion effected by spatial distribution of electrons 'In atoms bigger than that, got more electrons, they can't all fit in that first shell because the charges will repel each other. So you can't fit more than two electrons in that first shell, so the next shell is further out, because it is further the attraction is less.' (Pre- service teacher 14RCHp2.) b. Shielding related to repulsion between electrons 'As remove each electron the level of repulsion within that shell is going to be slightly less, I guess because slightly less electrons in it. I think that because 3 orbits in that shell so... as well there is a small degree of shielding from the nucleus from each orbit...' (Pre-service teacher 12RCHpl.) c.

So then it is willing to get rid of that because there's a bit of repulsion between these two electrons within that same orbital.' (Pre- service teacher 20CHp2.) Interestingly this pre-service teacher uses a scientific electrostatic argument, teleologically linking the magni- tude of ionisation energy to an implied intent of the atom to lose electrons in order to reduce repulsive interaction (Gilbert et al. 1998). Here the classification of response credits the identification of the electrostatic repulsion as a correct scientific causal argument, however such teleolog- ical arguments cannot be considered as scientifically cor- rect ideas. Atomic Representations Selected as Useful and Features Used in Explanations All of the 31 pre-service teachers identified С (Bohr Type) or D (Schrödinger type) or a combination of these atomic representations (and others) as useful to explain subsequent ionisation energies. Seventeen only identified Bohr type representations as useful and one only identified Schrödinger type as useful for explaining the subsequent ionization energies of an oxygen atom. When the pre-ser- vice teachers' descriptions of the representation's features were compared to those of the consensus model it repre- sents (Rutherford or Bohr or Schrödinger) and the language used in their explanations, most of the pre-service teachers drew on features of a hybrid Rutherford/Bohr model which allowed electrostatic aspects to be applied to electrons arranged in shells around the nucleus. For pre-service teachers that did not describe models' features in a manner consistent with the consensus features of the model it represents, the explanation given was used to note what sort of features from which atomic models they actually used. In all cases this was Rutherford/Bohr (representation C) or Schrödinger (representation D) type atomic models or a combination of both (and others). Fourteen pre-service teachers used only Rutherford/ Bohr features of atoms in their explanations, noted by references to only electron shells arranged around the nucleus and their selection of only representation С as helpful in explaining. Sixteen pre-service teachers used aspects of both Rutherford/Bohr and Schrödinger models in their explanations often referring to both shells and orbitais and selecting representations С and D. Finally one pre- service teacher used only features from the Schrödinger equation based model and used orbitais and probability ideas in his explanation. He only selected the Schrödinger type representation (D) as helpful for explaining. This is summarised in Table 3 which also indicates the type of atomic model features used in each explanatory idea, Springer</page><page sequence="12">414 J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-^22 where the language used or sketches drawn allows such a link to be suggested. The question order did not provide any notable differ- ences in pre-service teachers' explanations or their use of atomic models. Explanatory arguments that use repulsion rather than attraction as a causal factor are linked to a difference in the atomic models drawn upon in forming these arguments. Nineteen of the 31 (61%) pre-service teachers did not use any ideas about electrostatic repulsion in their explanations and so rather considered only the attractive interaction between nucleus and electron as significant, missing the effects of electron-electron repulsion. Discussion In this section, I will consider the connection between model features expressed and the arguments that are used to explain ionisation energy values. Firstly I consider how model features are used to provide causal arguments for the higher ionisation energy values for inner electrons due to their proximity to the nucleus. Then I compare the use of explanatory arguments that include repulsion and those that consider attraction and how these connect to the atomic models drawn upon. Finally, the connection between dif- ferent atomic model features and different causal argu- ments that are supported in order to provide a full explanation of the subsequent ionisation energy trends for an oxygen atom. Connections Between Model Features and Causal Arguments Twenty of the 31 pre-service teachers selected Rutherford/ Bohr type representations to use shells to account for the significant difference in ionisation energy values (between the 6th and 7th ionization of an oxygen atom). The argu- ment used is that the distance between the outer electron and the nucleus changes significantly and hence the attractive force between them is much greater. Concentric 'shell' rings in the Bohr representation were used to demonstrate the change in distance and hence the change in electrostatic force. This indicates that a hybrid Rutherford/ Bohr model is being used as in the Bohr atom represen- tation the rings are used to indicate quantized energy levels rather than the spatial distribution of electrons which is more in keeping with a Rutherford atom (See "Appendix", (Budde et al. 2002)). For example pre-service teacher 2CHP1 describes representation C's usefulness: 'I My last question is; if we look at all these different representations again, [showing stimulus materials again] can any of these actually help you to explain that subsequent ionisation energies, I asked about at the beginning? R The one I would use for the simplest, the easiest, removal of electrons without consideration of sub atomic, so sub-levels, would probably be this one here [points to representation C] be C. Easy to visualize that you've one electron in final shell, and you're taking it and removing it' Pre-service teacher 5RCHP3 drew this diagram to illustrate the visualisation that they used in order to explain the change in electrostatic attraction due to the electrons in an inner shell being nearer to the nucleus and to account for the jump in ionisation energy noted between the 6th and 7th ionisation of an oxygen atom (Fig. 5): A few pre-service teachers, like 1CHP2, when selecting the representations they could use to explain subsequent ionisation energy trends also recognised that this argument could be supported by Schrodinger type representation like D, although in a much more complex fashion: I 'Which are the most useful to you?' [Showing representations] R 'Probably not these two' [points to A and B] I 'So not A or B. So what would it be about C...?' R [interrupts] 'Probably this is most useful' [points to C] I 'Most useful, but you are not rejecting D? So what is it about these two different representations that you're sort of saying they're helpful in terms of explaining?'

R [interrupts] 'I accept these [points to С &amp;D] because of the inverse of these* [points to A &amp; B] [laughing] I 'Could you tell me what the inverse is? [Laughing too] R 'Okay. This [C] shows the idea of shells/ energy levels, as does this [D] to some extent I 'If I had to get you to choose one of them, which of these would you choose to develop your explanation? R 'To develop my explanation or to use with the explanation I actually gave?' I 'You can answer both questions?' R 'Okay to use in conjunction with the explanation I gave. I have to use a diagram like that. [C] If I was to go away and do a lot of reading about it and really try to answer these questions, I'd probably be thinking with diagrams like that [D]' I 'Why do you say that? R 'because I have read about this, I've just forgotten it' I 'But what then is it that's telling you. You have implied to me that 'I have used this model [C] to explain it today, but actually something in me is saying I could and should use this one'[D]?' R 'yes' [Later] R 'When you're talking about different energies of electrons, have to consider things like penetration, shielding and things, and effective nuclear charge, and electron-electron repulsion, things like that, which would really be explained from models like this [D]' For the causal argument of attraction between electron and nucleus being dependent upon the distance between them, the preference for Rutherford/Bohr representations is consistent with the use of the most straightforward model (Coll et al. 2005) and this usage is appropriate, however few pre-service teachers used arguments involving elec- trostatic repulsion and this distinction and its connection to the atomic model used is explored further below: Using Electrostatic Repulsion Arguments The Twelve pre-service teachers that did use ideas about electrostatic repulsion and especially those that connected paired electrons to increased repulsion used Schrödinger (D) orbital type model features in their explanations (Fig. 6). This is unsurprising as the Schrödinger representation (D) can accurately represent the charge properties of electrons and the distribution of these properties (Budde et al. 2002). Shielding can then be linked directly to electron-electron repulsion, rather than as a weakening of the attraction between nucleus and electron. The Bohr atom however does not represent electrostatic properties and also provides very limited spatial distribution information. So it does not support the development of explanations based on complex competing electrostatic interactions. Pre-service teacher 15CHp2 describes how representa- tion D is useful for explaining: '..To help me think about how easy or not it was to remove the electrons. Thinking about electrons being paired though, maybe D is useful as well with that. D is describing the shape of the orbitais, and thinking I can see that I have 3 p orbitais and I have got 6 electrons to go into them. They are going to be paired up.' Earlier in her explanation she linked pairing to repulsion: 'It's a bit lower because the first electron you are removing is a paired electron... Because they repel each other because they are both negatively charged. So it's easier you need less energy to remove one of them.' (Pre-service teacher 15CHp2.) The only pre-service teacher who chose D representation alone as useful for explaining subsequent ionisation energy Fig. 6 Chart comparing the types of ideas used in causality arguments and the atomic model ideas associated with using these arguments atomic features used in explanation Ш Rutherford/Bohr I Rutherford/Bohr &amp; Schrödinger □ Schrödinger only lili "О not involving § repulsion Ш1НИ1У1 co S I involving УУП Q repulsion со с I "'ШППН -MIMI, 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Number of Pre-Service teachers using idea Springer</page><page sequence="14">416 J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 trends similarly picked up on its usefulness to account for shielding and distribution of electrons around the nucleus. '..You can look here [points to an orbital lobe at the edge of representation] ...seems to represent these green f orbitais. I'm assuming that they are quite far away from the nucleus itself and they are being shiel- ded, but perhaps it can be explained that electrons are being removed or ionised because they're far away from the nucleus.' (Pre-service teacher 11 CHpl.) The use of electrostatic repulsion seems to have some connection with picturing electrons or electron properties as occupying distinct volumes around the nucleus like in representation D and other models based on solutions of Schrödinger' s equations. The visualisation of a volume of space that is essentially negatively charged, when a full shell is considered, allows the shielding effect to be perhaps more appropriately considered in terms of these inner electrons' mutual repulsion with outer ones. Simi- larly, it also allows the idea of orbital contraction when half occupied to help account for the lower ionisation energies required to remove an electron from a paired orbital which then, on average, has electrons that are further from the nucleus due to their mutual repulsion. One example of this 'orbital occupation causing repul- sion' idea was voiced by pre-service teacher 13CHpl: 'Could use [D] ...if you had showed that you removed an electron.... This is sometimes used to represent that you have an electron up there and another down there. [Points to lobes of an orbital in representation D] So if you pulled that electron out, this orbital can contract.' Not Using Electrostatic Repulsion Furthermore many pre-service teachers do not use elec- trostatic repulsion in their arguments. Twelve pre-service teachers directly related shielding to electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and electron rather than via electron - electron repulsion interactions affecting the distance between nucleus and electron. The meaning of 'Shielding' was probed when used by pre-service teacher 8RDHp2: 'How far electrons are from the nucleus, more shells there are the further away the outer electron is from the nucleus and they also, the shells shield the nucleus.' [Probe 'What do you mean by that?'] 'Block its effect on the other atoms around it. So less shells other atoms [sic] are more attracted to the nucleus.' (Pre-service teacher 8RCHp2.) The Bohr model gives a rigid sense of spatial arrangement between electrons and the nucleus and each other, which doesn't easily allow the repulsion properties to be consid- ered. Here the argument is not so much incorrect as incomplete. The connection of this argument with the type of atomic model used can be noted by these pre-service teacher's explanations of why they selected the represen- tations to aid their explanations. For example pre-service teacher 8RCHP2 uses the fixed Bohr shells to account for its usefulness in explaining distance effects on ionisation energies: '[C] shows more clearly that this shell is closer to the nucleus than that shell. So you can demonstrate that you are getting closer to the nucleus and that's why it requires more energy.' Pre-service teacher 23RCHP1 selects representation С because: '..with shells, because.... Explain using shielding ... you can kind of see there are two electrons between this shell [points to outer shell] and the nucleus...' This sense of the importance of visualising potential significant interaction between electrons is also born out when considering the five pre-service teachers whose explanations did not include any reference to repulsion and explained shielding in terms of electrostatic attraction as they all selected С representations and used features of Rutherford/Bohr atomic models in their explanations. Furthermore only four pre-service teachers were able to account for the general trend of increasing subsequent ionisation energy using a scientific causality argument. Significantly most of the pre-service teachers used 'shared charge' or the conservation of force idea. Pre-service teacher 16RCHP2 used a Rutherford/Bohr hybrid model to account for their explanation. Here the fixed quantum nature of the shell seems to fix the location of the spatial arrangement of the electrons, so that the reduction in the average distance of electrons from the nucleus is not noted as electrons are removed. This pre-service teacher selects representation С as most useful to help explain, despite earlier using orbital references like py in her explanation of the general increasing trend in ionisation energies: 'With each ionisation, the ionisation energy increases because from the first to the second. The first electron is removed from the 2pz and the second from the 2py. The electrostatic pull from the nucleus is greater for each ionisation. Shielding is the same and distance is the same.' Ö Springer</page><page sequence="15">J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 417 I 'why?' The positive charge on the nucleus stays the same. Removing a negative charge, so overall net charge is more positive, so overall pull is greater, so the energy required is greater.' When selecting representation С she confirmed that it provided the spatial distribution of electrons: 'because I think it allows you to associate the prox- imity of the electrons in their energy levels with the nucleus.' Although pre-service teacher 3CHP3 drew an orbital type representation of an atom as the one he used to form his explanation (Fig. 7a), he also described the electrons as being pulled in more strongly or being held tighter as each successive electron is removed. When asked to clarify further, he drew further diagrams (Fig. 7b), indicating shell contraction as electrons are removed. However when asked to explain this further he used an analogy: 'If you've got one person at the middle trying to hold onto lots people running around. If you can actually hold less then you can hold them more tightly. If down to just one at the end you can hold them tightly'. Fig. 7 Pre-service teacher 3CHP3's sketch of their visualised atom for explaining subsequent ionisation energies This mirrors the shared charge misconception where, the nucleus is redirecting its attractive force over the remaining electrons, rather than the reduction in electron numbers reducing the repulsion between them and hence allowing orbital or shell contraction. Pre-service teacher 3RCHP1 explained the general trend in increasing ionisation energy correctly, recognising the repulsion between electrons as controlling the distances between charges: 'there is a greater amount of energy required to remove it and that would be because the electrons are either kind of further away from the opposite charge of the nucleus but also because as electrons are being removed the kind of repulsion that they have between each other is also being removed.' [Later] I 'So what happens when we get to these next 3 electrons, the second, third and fourth?' R 'Not so sure, but the, I mean they're are all obviously on different axes in the p orbitais - I don't know if because there are all at the same energy level - whether they still feel some repulsion from other axes or not - that's a possibility because otherwise they would be all at same level She selects both representations С and D as useful because: 'C because it shows jumps, 'could talk about shielding of shells of outer electrons from the positive pull of the nucleus. D shows complex arrangement of electrons and could be used to explain jumps in energy. Useful for showing differences between s and p orbitais.' Here her use of orbital space and electron interactions is matched by her selection of the Schrödinger type D representation which she indicates shows this. Multiple Model Usage Pre-service teacher 7RCHP3 drew three visualisations (Fig. 8) she used in her explanation of subsequent ionisa- tion energies of oxygen and she clarified her usage of them in terms of their application to her arguments: 'Started off like (draws Fig. 8a). The next is hard to draw (drawing Fig. 8b) dots everywhere. That's my electron cloud. And you know... typical one (draws Fig. 8c).' She annotated the diagrams as shown and also clarified when she used these to help with her explanations: Springer</page><page sequence="16">418 J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 Fig. 8 Pre-service teacher 7RCHP3's diagrams of her visualisations during her explanations of the subsequent ionisation energy trends A (Linked to representation C) ^ Qs в - ' * V- (Linked to * representation B) л'0 Ж л'0 •- (Linked to N , V representation A) v^1 distribution to be noted and also allow electrostatic proper- ties to be applied to them. Conclusions There is a general tendency for pre-service teachers who used Schrödinger type atomic features in their expla- nations to use this to develop arguments about elec- tron-electron interactions and offer deeper causality explanations. However when pre-service teachers did not use any ideas about electrostatic repulsion in their expla- nations, they used Rutherford/Bohr representations to jus- tify their arguments and only drew on the Bohr shell distribution to describe the distance effects on ionisation energies. Furthermore a hybrid model use was common, when orbitais were used interchangeably with shells (Taber 2005). These hybrid models were infrequently used to support repulsion ideas and were often used when shielding was described as a blocking effect as noted above by pre- service teacher 23RCHP1. As the Bohr atomic model does not provide information regarding the electrostatic prop- erties of nucleus and electrons it is not surprising that such a link should be noted. However these findings indicate a linkage between the pre-service teachers' mental model of an atom and the types of electrostatic arguments offered to account for subsequent ionisation energy trends. When the diagram 8a at first (accounting for large rise in subsequent ionisation energy between removal of 2s1 and Is2 elec- trons), diagram 8c throughout, but diagram 8b only when explaining repulsion between electrons and electron cloud contraction. Later when considering the А, В, С &amp; D representations provided she linked her diagrams with them as indicated above (Fig. 8). She also explained how she could use representation С for explaining subsequent ionisation energies to account for differences when removing elec- trons from different shells and that this is easy to visualise. However she also noted that in order to explain for the generally rising trend: 'C is limited. All [electrons] seem as if they should be equal as all in the same shell.' This subject's selection of multiple atomic models to provide resources for her explanations is that of an expert. She moves from model to model as she looks for features to support the argument. So when she needs to account for orbital contraction as electrons are removed she selects an electron cloud visualisation (Fig. 8b) that can model the effects of a reduced negative charge as a reduction in repulsion and hence cloud radius. This sort of quantum model can provide robust resources to support complex electrostatic reasoning (Tsaparlis and Papaphotis 2009). However prior to this she uses both Bohr and Rutherford type visualisations (Fig. 8a, c) that allow the most significant differences in electron Ö Springer</page><page sequence="17">J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21:403-422 419 limitations of models like Rutherford/Bohr are not con- sidered, this seems to restrict the subjects' explanations to only considering electrostatic attraction arguments and this may encourage the use of inappropriate arguments like 'shared charge' caused by the 'fixed' shell radius of the Bohr atom. Implications This information should serve to provide pre-service teachers and their tutors with a snap shot of how the models are used by these pre-service teachers to account for ioni- sation energy phenomena which may have features in common with explanations offered by others. The explanatory ideas identified here are consistent with those of Singaporean pre-service teachers noted by Tan and Taber (2009) and therefore useful in developing pedagog- ical content knowledge of common misconceptions (de Jong et al. 2005). Furthermore, these findings suggest that science teachers need to be able to select and use complex atomic models that draw on Schrödinger' s wave equation to account for the distribution of charge properties and hence offer causal arguments involving both repulsion and attraction, as well as using Rutherford/Bohr models (McKagan et al. 2008). Further research is needed to establish if atomic mod- elling ideas similarly impact on other pre-service teachers' and in-service teachers' ionisation explanations more widely. If this is the case, questions are raised regarding the development of atomic modeling skills during teacher training courses. If teachers themselves find it difficult to select and use atomic models to offer causal arguments, then surely their students will experience the same diffi- culties. Teachers need professional development courses, to enable them to evaluate common atomic models so that they can clarify what model features best account for which properties. For example, the Bohr shells of electrons rep- resent major energetic differences between electrons in the atoms, rather than a spatial arrangement of electrons. Activities that allow the evaluation of models so that the inter-connection of the models and the phenomena that they can and cannot explain appropriately (Johnson-Laird 1983; Halloun 2007), would allow more complex and sophisticated models to be used when needed without having to reject the useful more simplistic ones (Coll et al. 2005). Ionisation energy explanations are such an activity where model limitations can be explored. In this research, I have specifically examined the role of atomic models as explanatory resources for ionisation energy values. The connection between the type of expressed model used and the ideas about electron charge properties of electrons expressed by pre-service science teachers has implications beyond this ionisation energy context. Atomic structure can be considered a threshold concept in science education (Park and Light 2009). Therefore, the need for pre-service teachers' to more expertly use and select different atomic mental models from their atomic model repertoire may apply to improving science teaching more generally. According to Valanides and Angeli (2006) pre-service teachers' mental models shape their teaching and hence the mental models of their students and thus subsequent ioni- sation explanations may offer a opportunity for teachers to both explore and demonstrate the limitations of consensus atomic models as the complexity of arguments involved offers the opportunity for this. Halloun (2007) suggests that such mediated modelling when both model construction and deployment is needed enables better conceptual understanding. Appendix: Coding Details See Tables 4, 5, 6.
