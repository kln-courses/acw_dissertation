ANTRIM Known in the older literature and marked on the one inch and six inch sheets (Antrim 4) as a cromlech, this monument, a small chambered cairn nearly half of which has been destroyed (Fig. 1), stands conspicuously on the edge of an old basalt quarry at a height of 400 ft about 200 yards S. of the coast road, at a point half way along White Park Bay (grid reference C 025436). It is easily reached by a lane leading to the aban doned quarry. The cairn seems to have been fairly well preserved in 1838 when it was described by Thomas Fegan in the Ordnance Survey Memoirs (Royal Irish Academy Collection, Antrim Box 3, Ballintoy parish). I am indebted to Dr Michael Herity for a copy of Fegan's description, which is not very accurately reproduced in O'Laverty.' The O.S. account reads: 'situated on a lofty eminence in the townland of Clegnagh, and holding of David Logan, and about 60 perches south of the road, there stands a Druid's Altar: situated about the middle of an oval platform, 32 by 23 feet, and enclosed by a row of large stones, sunk in the ground,'and-standing from Y2 to 3 feet above the surface. The Altar is a large stone of rather odd PLAN 0 4E * flW40, Fig. 1. 12</page><page sequence="2">shape, tapering from the base to the top. But a sort of concave on the under side. It measures 5V2 feet long, 5 feet broad, and 3 feet 2 inches thick, and it is supported on 4 stones, varying from ?2 to 212 feet above the surface, the vault beneath is 4Y2 feet long, 2? feet wide, and 2? do high.' This, from the description of the capstone, is clearly the ruined chamber that can be seen to-day, though only two uprights remain in place. But Fegan goes on to describe a second roofless 'altar' on the NW. side (which is now quarried away but which can best be interpreted as a passage). This was 'supported on 6 columns which stand from 1?2 to 2?2 feet above the surface and are of large size. The vault under this altar stood 4 feet long and 3 do wide. 18 of the columns are still extant in this place.' O'Laverty adds that the new owner was John McLernon, and notes that 'some of the stones have fallen into a quarry.' Despite this, he states that there were 18 stones sunk in the ground surrounding the cromlech, presumably the remains of Fegan's enclosing row of stones. To-day there are three large boulders visible on or in the cairn but no kerb can be seen. It should be added that it is much overgrown with whins. A photograph taken by R. J. Welch probably in the early part of the century (R.W. 1313) shows that the quarry had not then reached the chamber. The photo graph also shows a large upright stone, apparently about 3 ft high, perhaps 10 ft to the S. This confirms Fegan's statement that some of the sur rounding stones were 3 ft high. Strangely, this feature is not mentioned in the account nor shown in the sketch published by W. Gray in 1883.2 Although the putative passage was apparently wider than the existing chamber by half a foot, I believe the tomb can best be interpreted as a small passage grave, one of several known in NE. Antrim, though the surrounding stone circle, if such it was, makes it exceptional. It is true that the related chambered cairn known as the Druid Stone, Ballintoy, is said to have had two stone circles around it, but the only surviving circle is a fairly normal kerb.3 There has been some confusion in previously published accounts of Clegnagh. Gray4 refers to it as Glegnagh, and his illustration (pi. 10) is labelled Lemnagh. Lemnaghbeg is in fact the townland adjacent to Clegnagh townland which contains the small chambered cairn known as Cloghaboghil, so marked on the one inch map. The same writer tells us in 1883 that he 'has found worked flints, flint flakes and numerous chips of 2 ~~~~~Ids Fig. 2. (X '2). flint near the Clegnagh Cromlech stone. Stone celts have also been found in the immediate neigh bourhood'.5 Gray does not mention the quarry, so that it was presumably opened between 1874 and 1887. I have visited the site on numerous occasions since the 1930s and have picked up many flint flakes from the quarry floor. My collection in cludes the end-scraper illustrated in Fig. 2.1. About 30 years ago I found the two scrapers (2, 3) in the exposed section of the cairn. The entry in the Preliminary Survey of the Ancient Monuments of Northern Ireland (1940), p. 4 reads: 'In the exposed section one of the writers has, found several flint scrapers including a hollow scraper and fragmentary sherds well baked but undecorated.' It is the purpose of the present note to expand this statement. The basal layer of the cairn, consisting of brown earth and stones rests directly on the weathered surface of columnar basalt. In this layer I also found a few scraps of typical brown well-baked Neolithic pot tery of the Lyles Hill variety, though without rim or shoulder pieces. Similar pottery occurred in a layer containing much charcoal and comminuted burnt bone found under the cairn at the Druid Stone, but no such black layer can be seen in the exposed section at Clegnagh. The hollow scraper (Fig. 2.2) deserves comment because of the remark made by Rev. L M. Hewson, that hollow scrapers are unknown in the sandhill layers in the adjacent White Park Bay.6 I attach little importance to this observation, since I have a note that Knowles recorded a specimen not unlike that figured here, though I cannot now trace the reference.

SOME FLINT AXES AND OTHER FINDS Many of the hundreds of stone artifacts that find their way into private collections and museums are unlocated and many others, even if located, tend in time to lose their labels and with them much of their scientific value. We need all the information that can be obtained about types, lithic materials and distributions, and with this in mind I am putting on record a number of speci mens that I have found in surface searches or that have been reported to me. The most important of these, because of their comparative rarity in Ulster, are flint axes, wlether rough-outs or partly polished. John Evans notes' that while flint axes are comparatively rare in Ireland, polished ex amples are even rarer, and William Gray stated2 that he had found polished flint axes only on the Plains, in Belfast, and at Bannmouth West. Fig. 3.1, the best and largest specimen that has come to my notice, of honey-brown flint with a well-polished edge, was found in April 1945 by Mr J. S. Moore in the townland of Ballydivity about 2?2 miles N. of Dervock, Co. Antrim (approx. grid ref. C 955360). Fig. 3.2, reported to me by Miss Agatha Crawford, was found in 1930 on the Antrim shore of Lough Neagh between the mouths of the Crumlin and Glenavy Rivers (approx. grid *ref. J 120740). It is light ochreous in colour and has a tranchet cutting-edge. Fig. 3.3, also reported by Miss Crawford, was found in 1930 lying on sandy subsoil in the garden of 58 Marlborough Park South, Malone, Belfast (grid ref. 325715). Fig. 4.1 is a small specimen of ochreous flint found at Toomebridge, where the Lower Bann leaves Lough Neagh, and Fig. 4.2, labelled Kilwaughter (an extensive parish to the W. of Lame), is of grey flint and came to me from the collection of R. J. Welch. Fig. 4.3, the lower part of which is lightly polished, was found c. 1940 by Hugh O'Boyle when sinking a well in the townland of Ballymacricket, near Glenavy. The site is about a quarter of a mile N. of the Catholic church at a height of 200 ft (grid ref. 149721). Of grey flint, Fig.4. (X4). 14</page><page sequence="4">i N Fig. 5. (X 4L). iron-stained on one face, it is said to have come from a depth of 20 ft but had probably fallen from near the surface. Fig. 4.4 is from Squire's Hill (approx. grid ref. 300784). Of fresh grey flint, its cutting edge is unfinished or much battered. It was picked up in March 1946 in a ploughed field above a large abandoned limestone quarry. Although this seems to be the only axe-like artifact found, the peaty field, ploughed during the last years of the war of 193945, yielded an abundance of flint artifacts, numbers of which were given by the finder, Angus MacDonald, to the Ulster Museum. The flints bear a general resemblance to those excavated at Lyles Hill, Co. Antrim, and on one occasion, when we visited the site after a stray German bomb had made a crater in the field, Mr MacDonald and I picked up from its edges a few scraps of Lyles Hill Neolithic pottery. In Fig. 5 are shown two perforated hammer stones. No. I is probably from the river Bann. Presented to Victoria College, Belfast by Miss Agatha Crawford, it was obtained from a Porta down collector Mr Acheson, whose material came mostly from lightermen on the Bann. It is made of a dark igneous rock and bears slight traces of use at the narrow end. The broken example shown in Fig. 5.2 was picked up in the sandy workings of the Stranmillis brickyard about 1935, before they were built over (approx. grid ref. 338708). The writer also found here a number of worked flints and a few potsherds, undecorated but probably Bronze Age. They are now in the Ulster Museum. William Gray states3 that he had found 'flakes, scrapers, celts and arrowheads in the Stranmillis brickfields.' Fig. 5.3 illustrates an almost perforated quartzite stone which was shown to me by Mr J. Skillen and which is a different kind of artifact. In fact John Evans4 refers to such pivot-stones, noting that the high polish of their hollows distinguishes them from prehistoric artifacts. They were used to house the vertical spindles of mill stones. The specimen illustrated came from Courtney's Mill in the townland of Inishrush, some 2 miles W. of Portglenone, Co. Londonderry.

Londonderry S. of the Sperrin Mountains which projects SW. from about Draperstown along the upper valley of the Moyola River. Together with the adjoining Tyrone townlands of Brough derg and Davagh, drained by the feeders of the Broughderg River which flows W. to become the Owenkillew, it lies in an area of singular geological and archaeological interest which is associated, for older members of our society, with that remark able man George Barnett.' His most famous discovery, the Beaghmore stone circles, lie to the S., while the neolithic settlement at Ballynagilly is some five miles to the SE. and the celebrated Dun Ruadh a similar distance to the SW. Geology and glaciology have much to do with the archaeo logical wealth of the area, for the highly disturbed and highly mineralised crush zone along the Sperrin 'highland boundary' fault runs through it and seems to have attracted prehistoric pros pectors, while the sands and gravels left by retreating glaciers or dead ice in this high-lying dumping ground (600-0 ft) provided extensive areas of well-drained soils in what would other wise have been a harsh and infertile environment. To-day, indeed, much of the area is covered in blanket-bog, and a high proportion of the archaeo logical sites has been revealed by peat-cutters. Many years ago I was shown several of these sites by George Barnett. I returned to Glenviggan recently (August, 1974) with Mr Chris. Lynn of the Department of Finance's Archaeological Survey, our guide being James Brennan of Fegar ron, George Barnett's best-known pupil. My primary purpose was to see the location of an N FEEgT 2X/ Fig. 6. (x */). unusual discovery made in the peat over a decade ago - possibly a prehistoric bull-roarer - but we took the opportunity of looking at other relics. Lying on a thin layer of peat near small outcrops of chloritic schist (grid ref. 690879) is a perforated round stone disc some 3 ft in diameter and 8 in. thick at its widest but tapering away on one side to a broken rim (see Fig. 6). It is known locally as the stone wheel, and I have no doubt that it is a broken edge-wheel of the kind that was formerly used for breaking flax or tanning bark.' The stone is chloritic schist, no doubt quarried nearby. The missing portion was presumably broken or sheared off when the stone was being dressed in situ. I have similarly come across broken or unfinished mill stones in situations where no mills could conceivably have worked, which can be explained as damaged artifacts abandoned where they were quarried. The central hole, 4 in. in diameter, was cut from both sides but no attempt had been made to smooth the bad join. Some 200 yards to the NW. of the stone wheel is an apparently unrecorded wedge grave (grid ref. 686881) with a well-defined antechamber, the front of which is marked by a short slab leaving an entrance on both sides. A short distance NE. again (grid ref. 689884) and also unrecorded is a stone circle with many boulders visible inside and a substantial alignment running off (not tan gentially) which has two transverse uprights alongside. To the W. of the wedge-grave are many ancient clearance cairns and the irregular tumbled stone walls of a pre-peat field system. The 'bull-roarer' referred to above has a maximum thickness of 0.2 in., is slightly less than 2 in. wide and 7.5 in. in length, of which the handle takes up 3.25 in. (grid ref. 690880). To judge from the tapering thickness the original length of the blade was probably about 6 in. (Fig. 7). The cross-section is flat on one side and slightly convex on the other. The three perforations are all of hour-glass section and appear to have been first cut and then smoothed by burning. The large terminal hole is well-made but the two at the shoulders are crudely made, irregular and ill matched. Their purpose is a mystery, for they seem to have no bearing on the effectiveness of the object as a bull-roarer: at any rate the sound emitted did not appear to change when I covered them with selotape. They may conceivably be magic eyes but I am not aware that bull-roarers are anywhere regarded as anthropomorphic. The bull-roarer, if such it be, was found in the spring of 1963 not far from the stone wheel when peat was being cut in the turf bank belonging to Mr James McBride of Draperstown. Only a thin layer of peat now remains here but to judge from 16</page><page sequence="6">.5, NM Fig. 7. (X l/2). the depth of new cuttings not far away the blanket bog was originally some five ft. thick. Mr James Gunn, who was headmaster of St Columb's Vol. Sec. Intermediate School at Draperstown and thanks to whom the preservation of the artifact is due, noted that it was found at a depth of 40 in. He put it on exhibition in his collection of antiquities at the school, where I saw it in May, a short time after its discovery. It Iwas labelled: 'Bull-roarer, resembling Australian-turndun (sic) and Greek rhornbos'. Alongside was a soft wood copy with string attached, which, though too light in weight to function properly did emit a purr, if not a roar, when twirled. When I asked Mr Gunn how he had identified the discovery as a bull roarer he told me that an old man living in the district had recognized it as a 'thunder-spade' such as were made by children when he was at school. I have no reason to doubt this information but unfortunately when after considerable effort I managed to track down the informant, Mr Patrick Rogers of Tonagh, he was very old and he denied all knowledge of the subject. I am unable to say whether the Co. Derry toys had this unusual long handle which gives an artifact some resemblance to a spade or shovel, but I am inclined to doubt it. I have not come across any handled specimens of the bull-roarer from Ireland, though some specimens have a slight tang at the perforated end. The toy is recorded mainly from Ulster, but also from Cork, Carlow and Mayo.3 It is generally known by such onomatopaeic names as boomer, whunner, whizzer and whee-doodle. The term thunder-spade is recorded from Derry and Tyrone and from the Armagh-Down border, but a variant, 'thunder-speli'or 'thunder-spale', is usual in Antrim and Down. Mr Brendan Adams thinks that the form thunder-spade is probably a popular variant of the older forms spell/spale, due either to corruption or to some resemblance between the object and the blade of a narrow Irish spade. Spale, spell or spall all have the meaning of a chip (of wood or stone). The Irish term is ciirin bu'irthe which Mr Adams translates as'little roaring board'. The few examples I have seen from Ireland are thin narrow slips of wood up to a foot in length, perforated at one end and with notched sides4 very similar to those we made when I was a schoolboy in Shropshire. We often used an old boxwood ruler for the purpose. I had some corres pondence on the subject with the late Carl Schuster of Woodstock, New York, who was much inter ested in the peripheral notching of bull-roarers which he thought was a very ancient feature possibly going back to the palaeolithic period. He wrote: 'Notching has an extremely wide distribut ion among modern "primitives"; Australia, Africa, North America (including Eskimo) and Siberia, but in Europe is peculiar to the British Isles.' This is not quite correct, e.g. a notched specimen from Alva, Spain, is illustrated by Caro Baroja,5 but this does not disprove Schuster's theory that notching could be regarded as an example of peripheral survival in western Europe. In fact bull-roarers, notched or plain, seem to be unknown in the ethnology of Central Europe and Scandin avia. I am obliged to Dr Robert Wildhaber of the Swiss Museum fur Volkskunde in Basel, where Mr Schuster's'study materials' are now deposited, for this information. Mr Schuster put me in touch with Mr James D. Nason of Seattle, who is inter ested in the mechanics of the bull-roarer, and I sent him sketches of the Glenviggan artifact. He wrote: 'it doesn't much look like a bull-roarer, but its size and shape, aerodynamically speaking, are suitable enough. I wonder whether or not the wood in its original form was dense enough and had enough mass weight to rotate with sufficient velocity for production of sound, which derives from the vibrations of the string. The narrow neck is unusual but I can think of a Bushman specimen with a handle as well as a Melanesian and a Chukchee example.' Mr Nason did not know that our specimen is made of yew, one of the densest of woods. The identification was made by Miss Jenifer 17</page><page sequence="7">Hillam of the Palaeoecology Laboratory, Queen's University. The laboratory has also been able to date the peat horizon from where the object was removed. When Mr Gunn sent me the artifact in November 1965 I asked him to obtain a sample of peat from the spot. This he sent me in a polythene bag, labelled 'sample of contiguous peat', though I do not know how close it was to the actual find spot. After some delay Dr Alan Smith of the Palaeoecology Laboratory was able to report as follows: UB-546 (Glenviggan): 2060 - 45; 110 B.C. Comment: if 'bull-roarer' same age as peat, then apparently Iron Age.6 Although there must be some uncertainty both as to the purpose of the Glenviggan artifact and the reliability of the dating evidence (in so far as the peat sample was collected later) the discovery of a prehistoric bull-roarer in Ireland would not be surprising in view of the world-wide distribution and known antiquity of an artifact which was described by A. C. Haddon as 'perhaps the most ancient and sacred religious symbol in the world'.7 The noise of the bull-roarer is regarded in some societies, e.g. the Australian aborigines, as the voice of a spirit. It is invariably held to drive out sickness, to avert ill-luck, to produce thunder, raise a wind or bring rain, to promote fertility in animals or crops, to bring luck in hunting or fishing, to summon men and warn away women and children from ceremonies, especially those concerned with the 'rites of passage'. It is said to have been employed in the Scottish Highlands in the herding of cattle, though I cannot quote a source for this; nor can I find any evidence that the bull-roarer was known as a child's toy in Scotland. Mr Adrian Digby to whom I wrote for infor mation on bull-roarers put me in touch with Mr D. B. Taylor of the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, which has examples from many parts of the world, none of which, however, much resembles the object from Glenviggan. Mr Taylor cites handled examples from the Naga of Assam and also from the Zuni of New Mexico: they are, however, usually oval in shape. While not ruling out the possibility of its being a bull-roarer, he reminded me of the occasional discovery of wooden swords in Irish and Scottish bogs and wonders if it could be the hilt and shoulders of a broken wooden sword. The perforations, he points out, are in the right position for fastening the guard and grip, though one might have expected more holes in the handle. The fact that our specimen is made of yew brings to mind the yew-wood sword from Orkney dating from the late Bronze Age,8 which is, however, very solid and somewhat larger than its bronze prototypes. Mr R. B. K. Stevenson, who published this example, refers me to the discovery in the middle of the last century of 'hardwood swords' in the island of Jura, in a peat moss which also contained a bronze spearheads Three Irish examples are recorded, one of Hallstatt type found at Cappagh, Co. Kerry,'0 one from a crannog at Inver, Donegal" and a massive speci men from a bog in Co. Wicklow,"' which Dr A. T. Lucas tells me is also made of yew. To judge from the illustrations of these swords I do not think the Glenviggan artifact can be regarded as a sword, though it might have been a child's toy sword or dagger. The sloping shoulders would not be out of place in a short sword of the Early Iron Age. The suggestion has been made to me that it might be the broken model of a bronze sword made for the purpose of producing a clay casting mould, on the analogy of the models of spearheads and socketed axes found in peat near Tobermore, Co. Derry in 1911 and reported in this journal by H. W. M. Hodges.'3 It is, in my view, too poorly finished to have served this purpose and until a better explanation is forthcoming I prefer to regard the discovery as a bull-roarer, although I can find no explanation of the perforations in the blade.
