<plain_text><page sequence="1">Golden Emblems of aternal Transformations of Form and Meaning in Akan Regalia SUZANNE GOTT profusion of golden regalia worn or displayed by male and female tradi- tional rulers and their court officials on state occasions.2 Yet one particularly intriguing form of regalia has remained relatively unex- amined: an Asante chest ornament, or pectoral, that consists of paired golden disks in the form of stylized breasts sus- pended from a massive chain (Figs. 1-4). It appears to have originated within the context of Akan leadership arts, and it continues to be seen in the adornment of the two Asante royal fly-whisk atten- dants called mprakyirefoo (Fig. 5). In addi- tion, over the course of the past century, the dual-disk pectoral has increasingly become associated with a new display context, that of the funeral, where it is known as awisiado, or "orphan's neck- lace" (Fig. 6).3 Although the process by which the dual-disk pectoral came into being may always be somewhat of a mystery, its meanings related to fertility and mater- nity suggest some manner of historical association between the necklace worn by the mprakyirefoo and the funerary awisiado. At least one, and perhaps two, early European accounts offer intriguing information that, allied with more re- cent ethnographic research, provides insights into the apparent transforma- tion of the Akan single-disk pectoral into the Asante dual form. Akan Pectoral Ornaments The Asante necklace with two pendant disks belongs to the broader category of Akan chest ornaments known as adebo or adaaboo, which are among the profusion of golden ornaments worn and displayed by Asante rulers and members of the royal entourage (Christaller 1933:70; Kyerematen 1961:3). The single-disk akrafokanmu (popu- larly translated as "soul washer's badges" or "soul disks"; sing. Akrafokonmu) are considered to be the most characteristic type of Akan golden pectoral. They are worn by court officials called akrafo (Fig. 7), whose full range of duties has only recently begun to be understood (see Ross 2002a, b). I knew Roy Sieber as a teacher and mentor I became his student after he had officially retired, but as in all other aspects of his active and productive career, retirement didn't end his commitment to train a new generation of African-arts scholars. He still taught an annual graduate seminar and continued the tradition of more informal mentoring during long afternoons spent in the Sieber living room. I too was given this wonderful gift of spending time with Roy looking at and discussing African art together and listening to him and Sophie reminisce about their family's days in west Africa. And of course, learning about African art from Roy Sieber meant many trips to Motel 6 to view African traders' wares and learn what "looked right" and what didn't. Sometimes more costly pieces were brought to Roy for evaluation. I will never forget the afternoon when he asked me and another graduate student to carry a large wooden sculpture upstairs into the bathroom so that he could test its authenticity. As we turned it over, Roy took out a small bottle, dipped a Q-tip into it, and after a quick rub on its base, announced that the patina was indeed genuine. It was only later that I learned that the sculpture I had been holding upside down in the bathroom was valued at $600,000. Just another day in the Sieber household. For all of us who knew Roy, it is hard to accept that we can no longer give him a quick telephone call or drop in for a visit during a trip to Bloomington. But I do feel his continuing presence through memories of times we spent together, often laughing, and through his eloquent and insightful writings on African art. Having this article published in this memorial issue is particularly meaningful to me, because during the summer before his death, Roy worked with me in readying the manuscript for submission to African Arts. sPring 2003 ? african arts</page><page sequence="2">he Asante, an Akan peo- ple of southern Ghana, are renowned for com- municating status, wealth, and power through dis- plays of golden orna- ment and elaborately woven cloth.

The cast examples may be made of solid gold, of base metal electroplated with silver and gold, or of brass that has been polished to a golden shine. Akan pectoral disks have a distinctive suspen- sion structure. For a single-disk pectoral, a stick is passed horizontally behind the center of the disk and inserted through two hollow cylinders on each side. The pectoral hangs from a cord attached to the protruding ends of the stick.4 The suspen- sion method for the Asante double-disk pectoral is similar, requiring only a longer stick (see Fig. lb, the reverse of Fig. la). Similar suspension structures in gold dis- coid beads from at least the seventeenth century to the present, as well as the sym- bolic resonance of the circular form across a spectrum of Akan visual culture, attest to the historical depth of such discoid forms within the region.5 The fact that the Asante dual-disk ornament has remained largely unrecog- nized or poorly understood may be due in part to its relative absence from major museum collections.6 There is no docu- mentation of this form among the many gold objects that the British acquired as a result of Anglo-Asante wars in the late nineteenth century. In her catalogue of Asante regalia in museum collections, Martha Ehrlich did find two sheet-gold disks, "broken in half and numbered sep- arately," that had been accessioned in 1875 by the Royal Scottish Museum. They may have originally formed one pectoral prior to their removal from Kumase, the Asante capital, during the 1874 war (Ehrlich 1981, vol. 2: fig. 36). It is possible that other single-disk pectorals in museum or private collec- tions are only half of the original orna- ment.7 The paired Asante disks are not actually attached to each other, and they could have been disassembled-as might have happened during British soldiers' efforts to consolidate Asante war booty for transport.8 Early Historical Evidence of Golden Dual-Disk Ornaments in the Akan Court The earliest known image of a dual-disk ornament from the Gold Coast (modern Ghana) appears in Dutch trader Pieter de This page: Top: 2.

Marees' 1602 account, which contains two captioned illustrations (nos. 15, 16) of a distinctive gold bracelet worn by women.9 One of these copperplate engravings de- picts women of three different social sta- tions (Fig. 8). The central figure, "A," displays a large ornament comprising two disks on the wrist of her upraised arm. In the accompanying caption, De Marees identifies the woman as "a King's wife...dressed in her Sunday best in order to go out.... [wearing] Around one arm...a golden bracelet, such as great Ladies wear" (1987 [1602]:174). The other engrav- ing (Fig. 9) illustrates the "triumphal cere- mony" for a man who has attained the status of "Nobleman." De Marees directs the viewer's attention to figure "C," "the Wife of the Nobleman...[who wears] on her left arm a golden Bracelet whose tips are round and hollow"-a bracelet in the form of "a Ring [bangle] which has on each end a round Figure [shape] in the form of the lid of a Pot, made entirely of Gold" (1987 [1602]:167-69).10 Although it 68 african arts - spring 2003</page><page sequence="4">DON COLE is difficult to attribute any direct histori- cal association between these early-sev- enteenth-century gold bracelets and the dual-disk pectoral, one can argue that the prominence of the two round ter- minals in the engravings may indicate not only the presence but also the ap- peal of the dual-disk form in early Gold Coast regalia. The earliest evidence of gold pecto- rals of this type appears one hundred years later, in the 1702 account of French prefect Fr. Godefroy Loyer, who de- scribes an audience with Akassini, ruler of Assini, a gold-rich coastal state strad- dling the present-day border region of Ghana and C6te d'Ivoire. In J.B. Donne's discussion of this passage (1977:101), he notes that although Loyer "makes no mention" of Akassini's wearing gold, he did see an abundance of gold or- nament displayed by members of the royal entourage. Of particular interest for our present inquiry is the following passage, illus- trated by a frontispiece drawing (Fig. 10), in which Loyer describes ornaments worn by the ruler's "two favorite wives": Seated to the side of the King on this same dais, but a little to the rear, were his two favorite wives, each bearing on her shoulders a wide saber with a hilt of gold, from which hung a sheep's skull of gold, as large as life, or more. On the scab- bard there was a large shell of the same, around which were strung about a hundred Tigers' teeth. These two women were adorned with great necklaces of gold, brace- lets of the same, and large gold disks in the form of breasts, which were suspended over their bosoms by means of a gold chain. (Loyer 1935 [1714]:161-62; my translation) Although Loyer provides the only known description of gold dual-disk pectorals prior to the twentieth century, it is unlike- ly that such ornamentation was unique to the Assini court, given the frequency with which emerging Gold Coast states adopt- ed the regalia practices of more estab- lished polities."1 Dual-Disk Ornaments in the Contemporary Court Except for the matter of gender, Loyer's early-eighteenth-century description of the two Assini royal female sword bearers bears a strong similarity to T. E. Bowdich's early-nineteenth-century descriptions of these important Asante court function- aries (1966 [1819]:34-35, 291). Bowdich makes no mention of the king's sword bearers, who are male, or any other atten- dants wearing such breastlike ornaments. Doran Ross, however, has observed that the male bearer of the Bosomuru sword, considered the earliest Asante sword of state, does wear today a small golden dual-disk pectoral (Fig. 11). This sword is also the first of the Abosomfena, those spring 2003 - african arts 69</page><page sequence="5">state swords representative of the king's sunsum, or "vital spiritual essence."12 A.A.Y. Kyerematen describes the sa- cred nature of the Bosomuru sword, which is ornamented with a magically empowered mangabey skull believed to have been caught from the skies by the legendary late-seventeenth-century priest Okomfo Anokye for the first Asante king, Asantehene Osei Tutu. At his in- stallation, the king-elect makes his most solemn vows of office as he accepts the Bosomuru sword (Kyerematen 1961:11-13; 1969-70:22-25). During the latter half of the twentieth century, various scholars noted that gold- en dual-disk pectorals are also among the regalia of the young female atten- dants known as mprakyirefoo (Fig. 5), who are daughters or granddaughters of the Asantehene or members of the royal matrilineage (Ross 2002b:29).13 Kyerema- ten describes the two mprakyirefoo in the Asantehene's entourage as "gorgeously dressed in a traditional manner, borne shoulder high, and switching in the air white horse-tail whisks" (1961:15)-an activity that, according to Edward Ayensu, is designed "to ward off evil spirits that may follow the Asantehene" (1997:139). However, "their real place in the proces- sion," Kyerematen emphasizes, "is to show the wealth of the King" (1961:15). Mprakyirefoo have also been described as symbolizing "the soul of the people" and as portraying "the Asante concept of beauty" (Tufuo &amp; Donkor 1989:62; Boaten 1993:65-66). According to Akan custom- ary belief, the corporeal body is the visible form of the kra, or "inner spiritual self," and good health and beauty are a re- flection of spiritual wholeness (Hagan 1964:102). Michelle Gilbert has analyzed the attributes and significance of the royal entourage of the ruler of Akuapem, another Akan kingdom, particularly the akrafo attendants who wear the golden "soul-disk" pectorals (akrafokrnmu). She describes such a pairing of ideal beauty with the inner spiritual self: Immediately in front of the king are seated the extensions of his own inner spiritual nature. Nearest him are the akrafo ('souls'), who are chosen when children and whose beauty represents that of the king himself; they share the destiny of the king (in the past they would die when he did), and prevent dangers from coming close to him. (Gilbert 1987:312) It is a common practice, Ross observes, for Akan chiefs attending festival and ceremonial events to be preceded "by a young girl, usually the chief's niece, who represents the matrilineage and the soul (kra) of the chief" (1998:43). The mprakyirefoo, with their royal iden- tity and physical and spiritual beauty, serve as idealized representations of the COURTESY OF EDWARD S. AYENSU 70 african arts - spring 2003</page><page sequence="6">Asantehene and, by extension, the Asante people. Their wearing of the breastlike pectorals is a crucial expression of fertili- ty and a "maternal," nurturing benevo- lence-ideals for men as well as women that are associated with Asante leader- ship.14 Libations to the ancestors are accompanied by prayers for fertility in members of both sexes. Sterility has long been "regarded as disgraceful and unfor- tunate," and Asante kings who proved to be impotent or sterile could be destooled (Nketia 1955:36). I have found no evidence, nor have I myself observed, any dual-disk pectorals in the entourage of an Asante queen mother. The explanation lies in the differ- ent symbolic roles of Akan kings and queen mothers. Gilbert observes that although a queen mother in Akuapem as well as Asante is regarded as "the per- sonification of motherhood" (Rattray 1923:85),15 she is not required to be fertile. According to Gilbert's argument, this is because it is not she but the king who serves as the symbol of the kingdom. Thus, although a king in matrilineal Akan society does not produce his royal heir, "he must produce children to show that it is he, as symbol of the kingdom, who is fertile" (1993:5-6). It is for this reason, I believe, that it is important on state occa- sions for an Asante king to express this idea through mprakyirefoo adorned with golden, breastlike regalia. Courtlike Displays of Wealth in Ennoblement Ceremonies We have seen that pectorals like those worn today by the Asante royal mprakyi- refoo have been documented by Loyer in the court display of an early-eighteenth- century Gold Coast ruler.

Clues may be found in Akan practices of "ennoblement" that date from at least the early seventeenth century and in major changes regarding the accu- mulation and display of wealth that took place in late-nineteenth-century Asante. While the display of the regalia and attendants associated with Asante lead- ership has conventionally been regarded as the exclusive prerogative of enstooled male and female rulers, in recent years historians have drawn our attention to a special occasion when certain other in- dividuals were given the qpportunity to put on a "royal" display of wealth (Wilks 1979; Arhin 1983, 1990; McCaskie 1983, 1986). This was the once-in-a-life- time event associated with a wealthy person's attainment of the special status of obirsmpon, (pl. abirsmpon), a term derived from the pairing of the words obarima ("valiant man") and pan ("great, powerful").16 In eighteenth- and nineteenth-centu- ry Asante, personal wealth was subject to a rigorous system of death duties (awunnyadee) and inheritance taxes (ayibuadee) that effectively transferred much of this wealth from the family to the state. During their lives, singularly rich individuals were honored as "bene- factors of the community" and given the rank of obirmnpon (Wilks 1979; McCaskie 1995). This achievement was proclaimed and celebrated by ritual and ceremonial displays of royal proportions-supreme examples of poatwa ("challenge"), an Asante practice that involves both the "verbal and nonverbal assertion of supe- rior status" (Arhin 1990:532). Given the inextricable link between gold, wealth, and power in Asante, great quantities of gold ornaments figured prominently in these courtlike, status-asserting displays. spring 2003 - african arts 71</page><page sequence="7">.... - - ? ii-- - ?: : Mor .4r? II M7 One such occasion was witnessed in 1817 by William Hutchison, Acting British Consul in Kumase. In recording the preparations for an abirempon display, Hutchison noted that the main activity involved fashioning "their gold into various articles of dress for show." He described the regalia that had been com- missioned by an important court official, "Apokoo" (identified as Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre in Wilks 1979:15), for his "exhibition" of riches: Apokoo...shewed me his varieties, weighing upwards of 800 bendas [?7,200 currency] of the finest gold; among the articles, was a girdle two inches broad. Gold chains for the neck, arms, legs, &amp;c. ornaments for the ancles of all descriptions, con- sisting of manacles, with keys, bells, chairs, and padlocks. For his numer- ous family of wives, children, and captains, were armlets and various ornaments.....New umbrellas made in fantastical shapes, gold swords and figures of animals, birds, beasts, and fishes of the same metal. (Hutchison in Bowdich 1966 [1819]:395)17 Hutchison's 1817 account appears to document a centuries-old tradition. Two centuries earlier, De Marees had ob- served a "triumphal ceremony" celebrat- ing a man's rise to the status of "Brenipono, " or "Nobleman." In the caption to the copperplate engraving illustrating such an occasion (see Fig. 9), he writes: "In this picture, you may see in what man- ner and with what kind of triumphal ceremony they make a Nobleman, who (when he is promoted to this status) gives away all his goods to the people in order to be a Nobleman, which is something they very much hope to achieve, from their youth onwards" (De Marees 1987 [1602]:167). In his 1702 ac- count, Loyer does not mention such an event during his stay in Assini, but the prefect did record a trader's daily prayer asking the supreme deity Anguioume (Onyame) for "Brembi," Loyer's version of the term abirempon.18 The prayer may indicate the presence of similar ennoble- ment ceremonies, marked by courtlike representations of golden wealth, in eigh- teenth-century Assini as well as other Gold Coast states.19 Beginning in the late nineteenth cen- tury in Asante, displays of gold regalia, once restricted to royalty and exclusive events like the attainment of the rank of obirempon, became increasingly accessi- ble to the larger population. Kwame Arhin observes that this "democratiza- tion" of the accumulation and display of wealth was part of a larger economic and conceptual "break with the past," brought on by internal instability, the formal and informal inroads of British colonial authority, and the efforts of Asante's newly emergent entrepreneur- ial elite, the akonkofoo (Arhin 1990:525-28; McCaskie 1983:39).20 In the early twentieth century, with "the absence of the restraining hand of the state" a broader sector of the popula- tion began to engage in poatwa: Much of the well-known present- day Asante competitive acquisition, poatwa, of the biggest buildings, the latest and largest car models and extremely expensive funeral rites is calculated self-assertion: it is a mes- sage that one may not be an indige- nous ruler but one is in certain wNrv"!-2 AA16, --01' "1". lam 40 P Woww 1C*~pool', ..4e-p4p irad*Mb age ac~~i 72 african arts * sDring 2003</page><page sequence="8">Opposite page: Top: 8.

Loyer's early-eighteenth-century description of the ornaments worn by the two sword-bearing wives is the earliest known observation of dual- disk gold pectorals. material respects equal to or even above such a ruler. (Arhin 1990:533)21 I believe that it was during this period of social upheaval and realignment that the Asante dual-disk item of regalia emerged as a new category of chest ornament- the funerary necklace popularly known as awisiado. Courtlike Displays of Wealth for Life-Cycle Events According to certain accounts of the time, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, golden regalia was being em- ployed by both royals and nonroyals in such life-cycle events as female nubility rites and funerals. Not surprisingly, the earliest documentation of such regal dis- plays by nonroyals is of observances tak- ing place within the more expansive social milieu of the coast, rather than in the Asante interior. These historical ac- counts also reveal that those of limited means managed to stage courtlike life- cycle displays by borrowing, or even pawning. As we shall see, this enlistment of extra-familial resources eventually developed into the more formalized, and affordable, "hiring" system that is pres- ent in contemporary Asante. Female Nubility Rites Brodie Cruikshank, in the 1853 account of his eighteen-year stay among the Fante, a coastal Akan people, described the court- like display that characterized a young woman's coming-of-age rites: ...the girl is dressed out with most extraordinary care in rich silks, bor- rowed in many instances for the occasion. Her hair is completely covered with golden ornaments, consisting of doubloons, sovereigns, figures of serpents, fish, alligators, and crosses. Chains of gold hang down over her bosom ....Armlets and anklets of gold encircle her wrists and feet....As soon as she has been properly attired, she is parad- ed through the streets, attended by a numerous escort of her own sex, one of whom holds an umbrella over her head, to protect her from the sun, or rather, perhaps, to aid the effect of her elaborate toilet. (Cruikshank 1966 [1853]:193-94) Rattray's 1927 documentation of the Asante nubility rites (bragoro) held for "a young princess of the royal clan" shows the initiate seated in state, wearing a large golden dual-disk ornament (Fig. 12). To my knowledge, this is the earliest photograph of an Asante dual-disk pectoral. In this instance it is unclear whether it was worn because of the ini- tiate's royal lineage or because it was a feature of bragoro (Rattray 1927:70-71). No such necklace is evident in a studio por- trait, dated 1925-1945, that was apparent- ly made to record the "outdooring" finery worn by an Asante bragoro initiate for her public presentation (Fig. 13; see also Kyei 1992:xi, xiii), nor in the photograph of initiates in Bishop Peter Sarpong's 1977 study of Asante nubility rites.22 However, all of these portraits do reveal the special importance of breast display during bragoro. According to Sarpong, the exposure of an initiate's breasts "serves to demonstrate her ma- turity and consequently her right to be spring 2003 - african arts 73</page><page sequence="9">numbered among Ashanti adult women." Firm rather than "loose drooping breasts" also attest to an initiate's "moral integri- ty," being regarded as visible proof that the girl had not become shamefully preg- nant prior to undergoing the rites re- quired for socially sanctioned maturity (Sarpong 1977:63, 30-31). In Rattray's account, the dual-disk pectoral worn above the exposed breasts of this Asante "princess" may have served to accentu- ate the fertility and maternal ideals not only of this young initiate but also of her royal lineage. It is significant that in the context of bragoro, the distinction between royal and nonroyal status is intentionally obscured. An initiate is given the honorific title of "Six-day queen mother" (Nna nsia hem- maa) in reference to her exalted position during the six-day period of confinement. A bragoro "queen mother" symbolically exercises the privileges and responsibili- ties of her elevated status, being served and cared for by young girls who "are at her beck and call to obey her 'com- mands.' " The initiate may even "settle petty cases" in a mock court, much like a true queen mother. She also appears in public like a royal, dressed as richly as This page: Top: 11.

A family will expend great effort to make a prestigious show. A grand funeral upholds the honor of the matrilineage and, according to custom- ary belief, elevates the position of the deceased in the ancestral world. Various stages of Asante funeral rites employ "royal" modes of display. For the more prestigious "wake-keepings," the deceased is richly dressed and adorned with precious beads and gold jewelry-particularly the distinctive gold- en ahene komate (chief's necklace)-and laid upon a bed in a room decorated with lace, kente, and other expensive cloths (Fig. 14). During the course of the night-long wake-keeping, two, three, or four changes of dress and room decor may occur as a means of asserting the wealth and status of the deceased and the bereaved family.24 It is in this context of mourning and high-status display that one finds the dual- disk pectoral known as the "orphan's necklace." In the late 1980s, Timothy Garrard was the first scholar to report that gold or gold-plated pectoral disks "called awisiado or ewisiado" were being worn at contemporary Asante funerals (1989:66); he did not, however, see them himself. Only in the last decade have certain schol- ars identified the golden awisiado necklace as a funerary gift for the adult child of a deceased parent (Arhin 1994:316; Manuh 1995:198; De Witte 2001:70). The formal presentation of this golden embodiment of benevolent, "motherly" care is regard- ed as an admirable and prestigious ges- ture of "consolation" that a spouse and their family may make to the "orphan" (Figs. 6, 15, 16).25 From Court to Funerals: Transformations of Meaning for the Dual-Disk Pectoral What is the historical connection between the awisiado presented at contemporary Asante funerals and the dual-disk gold ornaments described by De Marees and Loyer in the early seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries? As we have seen, their early sightings of these ornaments oc- curred in the context of the court, and courtlike, displays of two coastal states. Such exhibitions of wealth and status were to become increasingly accessible to the general population during the nine- teenth and twentieth centuries. This ex- panding practice of high-status display apparently was first a phenomenon of the more fluid social milieu of coastal trade centers (Arhin 1983). Not surprisingly, golden regalia was linked to those life- cycle observances that elevated the status of individuals and their families. Ivor Wilks observes that in nine- teenth-century Asante, wealthy men (and women) were honored with "lavish" funeral rites "in recognition of their con- tribution to the national well-being," particularly with respect to the death duties levied by the state (1979:11). Bowdich, during his 1817 stay in Kumase, recorded the funeral rites held for the mother of an official in the Asantehene's court. Every effort was made to create an impressive display, by dressing the corpse richly and providing cloth, gold, and slaves to accompany the deceased as she entered the realm of the ancestors (1966 [1819]:282-83). By the early twentieth century, court- like processions featuring young women adorned with golden dual-disk pectorals had become associated with more presti- gious Asante funerals. This special dance procession, called adosoa-kyekyere, or simply adosoa, was sponsored by a wife (or wives) as a means of "consoling" her husband by "uplifting the image" of his deceased father or mother.26 Today it continues to be the most prestigious means of presenting the awisiado to one's bereaved husband or wife following such a loss. Former queen mother Nana Afua Pokuaa, an adosoa specialist who is in her nineties, describes this event as "a spring 2003 - african arts 75</page><page sequence="11">ritual to herald the triumphant entry of the deceased into the ancestral world."27 The name adosoa-kyekyere refers to the bringing together or "bundling" (kyekyere) of precious family heirlooms (adosoa or adosowa) to make a regal commemorative display.28 On a more metaphoric level, the name refers to the act of "consolation" (awerdyekyere)-a term that combines the words were ("heart," as the seat of feel- ings) with kyekye, or kyekyere ("to bind up")-literally, "to bind up a wounded heart" (Christaller 1933:571-73). According to Professor Mawere Opoku, founder of the Ghana National Dance Ensemble, the early-twentieth-century adosoa-kyekyere, featuring an Adasoahemaa (Adosoa "queen") and Adosoahene (Adasoa "king"), was apparently much more elab- orate than the late-twentieth-century procession in which one richly dressed female dancer, the Adasoahemaa, is flanked by two young girls. Professor Opoku writes of one "spectacular" adosoakyekyere that he witnessed as a young boy in Kumase in the early 1920s. It was per- This page from top: 14.

Behind these girls came the bearers of state swords and other regalia, then the Adosoa queen and an Adosoa king who was really a girl dressed as an ohene, or chief. The pair sat in a carriage festooned with rare blankets and cushions; last came the bearer of a state um- brella borrowed for the occasion. The carriage was drawn not by horses but by relays of stalwart women; the explanation given by the status-conscious Asante elders was that the horse and rider would have looked taller and therefore symbolically would seem to be of higher rank than the adosoa royals. (Opoku 1987:195)29 In these early years, regalia of state swords and umbrellas, as well as royal kete drums and drummers, could only be borrowed from the royal court. A fami- ly's privileged social standing was evi- denced by its ability to mount a display of regalia lent by the Asantehene or a local chief for an adosoa presentation.30 In adosoa dance processions of the past, the richly adorned Adosoahemaa dancer, flanked by her two young "attendants," would remove the awisiado from her own neck and place it around the neck of the husband in a regal gesture of consolation (Fig. 17).31 Today the awisiado is usually placed on a silver tray, along with a doz- en handkerchiefs ("to wipe away your tears") and a bottle of schnapps (a time- honored means of libation), to be formal- ly presented among the gifts of cloth and expensive liquors given by the wife's fam- ily (see Fig. 16). Although the adosoa remains the most prestigious means of presentation, less costly ones frequently take place. In fact, for these contemporary exhibitions of poatwa (assertions of wealth and status), the silver trays and brass pans bearing high-status cloths (and beads, for a de- ceased woman), liquors, and the awisiado are now usually hired for the event (Figs. 18, 19). If a client has sufficient funds, the present-day suppliers of funerary re- galia can also arrange for an adosoa dance performance. Today these funerary presentations may be sponsored by the spouse of not only a bereaved husband but also a bereaved wife. The gift of the breastlike awisiado expresses deep consolation as well as a degree of enduring support that, over the course of the twentieth century, many Asante have increasingly come to associate with one's mother and matrilineage. Maternal Nurturance and the Consoling Awisiado The Significance of the Maternal Principle In the Ashanti Region of Ghana, the maternal principle has long been invest- ed with a special moral and emotional resonance. In his study of Asante kinship and marriage, Meyer Fortes describes the mother-child bond as the "keystone of all spring 2003 - african arts 77</page><page sequence="13">social relations," observing that in an "individual's life-history, his or her mother stands for unquestioning protec- tion and support against the world at large" (1950:263-64). In recent yeats, as the fiscal pressures of Ghana's troubled economy have put increasing strains on the more tenuous paternal obligations of Asante's matrilineal, polygynous social system, Takyiwaa Manuh finds that chil- dren's welfare has become increasingly dependent on mothers and their matri- lineage (1993:179). The historical roots of such changes have been examined in a recent study of women in colonial Asante (Allman &amp; Tashjian 2000:85-132). Motherliness is expressed by the word abaatan ("mother"). The term refers literal- ly to the customary forty-day period of rest and seclusion (otan) by a woman (abaa) following childbirth (Clark 1999:722; Christaller 1933:493). Gracia Clark ob- serves, however, that it is invariably understood to mean "a nursing moth- er"-a fundamental attribute of Asante motherhood that connotes far more than the literal provision of breast milk (1999:721-23).32 During my own field- work, I learned that female animals with young may be given the personified, hon- orific appellation of obaatan, as in the name for the popular factory-cloth de- sign of a mother hen and her chicks: Akokabaatan ne ne mma (lit. "Nursing- mother chicken and her children"). Clark's analysis of the concept abaatan ("nursing mother"), and the related term obaatan adwuma, or "nursing-mother work," reveals the "economic" nature of Asante motherhood (Clark 1999:723). The idea that such nurturing benevolence is an essen- tially female characteristic was forcefully expressed by one female trader I inter- viewed in Kumase in 1990: "In Ashanti, the mother is everything....I am the one who takes care of her." This trader spoke with pride of her own hard work and self- sacrifice as a mature Asante woman with the commitment and will to care for her elderly mother and her grandson, and who was able to send three children to England for their advanced education. Nursing-Mother Imagery in Akan Visual and Verbal Art Nursing-mother imagery is a prominent feature of Akan visual and verbal art. Herbert Cole and Doran Ross have ob- served that wooden nursing-mother figures (see Fig. 20) express "ideas of nourish- This page: Left: 20. Queen mother with child, carved by Osei Bonsu, 1934.

The relief carving is believed to be of Queen Victoria, whom the colonial government worked to portray as a symbol of sustenance and benevo- lence (Ross 1998: 117), ideals of Asante leader- ship often expressed through maternal imagery. 78 african arts * sDring 2003 8 z 0 0 t- O in ,n c c M</page><page sequence="14">CcWON</page><page sequence="15">ment, the family, and the continuity of a lineage or state" (1977:111). The power of Asante motherhood is also evident in more menacing breast imagery, such as that Rattray found in the Fwemso witch- finding shrine-a life-size clay model of a pair of breasts, with a knife thrust in between, symbolizing its powerful capac- ity to seize and kill a witch's spirit (Fig. 21; see Rattray 1927:31-32).33 The master drums, or "mother" drums, of the Akan popular bands that flour- ished during the first half of the twen- tieth century frequently display nursing imagery, often in the form of up to eight carved breasts affixed to the front (Cole &amp; Ross 1977; Ross 1984, 1988, 1989). Ross, who has written extensively on the iconography of these drums, has drawn our attention to one particularly intrigu- ing, early-twentieth-century master drum (1988). It features a pair of breasts attached to the relief carving of a crowned Euro- pean woman whom he has identified as Queen Victoria (Fig. 22). The colonial gov- ernment, Ross notes, widely circulated photographs of the British monarch as "a symbol of benevolence and sustenance," and the Akan carver's placement of her image on a breasted drum "was consistent with indigenous conceptions of the drum" (Ross 1988:117). Benevolence and sustenance, as ideals of Akan leadership, have long been ex- pressed in such images of maternal nurtu- rance. Among the Asantehene's state regalia are a sword and an umbrella that each bear the golden image of a mother hen and her chicks. The associated prov- erb, "A hen steps on her chicks not to kill but to set them on the right path," casts the powers and responsibilities of Asante royal authority in motherly, benev- olent terms (Kyerematen 1961:10). This state sword and umbrella are both known as Akokobaatan, or "Mother hen" (lit. "nursing-mother" chicken), a term that explicitly references the all-encompassing care of an Asante nursing mother. The proverb "Ohene nufu doso a, amansan na enum" ("When a chief has plenty of breast milk, then all the people of the This page: Left: 23. Atena funerary head-covering. Kumase, 1990.

Meebewu ama esie adwiri. (I am the ant queen. When I die the whole ant hill will collapse.) As M.H. Frempong recalled the elderly uncle who sang these words on his deathbed, he explained the appropriate- ness of this maternal metaphor for the "one devoted person who is the real fam- ily tree." The ant queen, he explained, who "is very soft and full of fat," provid- ed a symbol of generative nurturance that was especially fitting for this "benevo- lent" uncle who had provided sustenance and support for his extended family.35 In Akan funeral dirges, the imagery used to mourn the loss of an especially benevolent father or male relative may be expressed in maternal terms. Such an indi- 80 african arts - spring 2003</page><page sequence="16">vidual may be lauded as "a man who was a mother to children" (Nketia 1955:35-36). After one father's death, his children chose a cloth to place in his coffin. Its proverbial name was "Obaatan nim se ne baa didi" ("It is a mother who knows what her child eats"). The "nursing mother" meaning of the term abaatan expressed this father's exceptional care (Gott 1994:214). Similarly, Clark found that a father who provides unflagging financial support is often praised during his lifetime as being "a real obaatan" (1999:721-23). Funeral dirges lamenting the passing of a beloved mother often include such panegyric phrases as: "The mother who gives to both mother and child"; "The mighty tree with big branches laden with fruit. When children come to you, they find something to eat." Other phras- es associate maternal benevolence with the provision of nurturing breast milk (Nketia 1955:10): "Mother Aba, the great Breast that children suck," and "Mother Aba, the great wooden Food Bowl around which children gather." In Akan expressive culture, a child who has lost his or her mother is the epit- ome of the orphan (awisiaa). Such a child is considered to be a particularly poignant image of vulnerability and abandonment, as in the proverb "Awisiaa su a, ommre nisuo ho" ("When the orphan weeps, tears come easily"; Akrofi 1962: no. 1013). In examin- ing the image of death in Akan highlife songs, Sjaak van der Geest found the most common theme to be a mother's death and the devastating nature of ma- ternal loss (1980:152-53): An orphan is to be pitied. My mother, who would help me, is dead and buried at the cemetery. I am a small boy, left alone in the world to face hardship. He observed that such highlife lyrics ex- press "the fact that someone without a mother is regarded as someone 'without anybody' " (Van der Geest 1980:150). Mourning Imagery Expressing Parental Loss In the Ashanti Region, the presentation and wearing of the awisiado is an established feature of contemporary funeral obser- vances. The necklace derives its name from the pairing of awisiaa (orphan) and do (to love), literally meaning "for the love of the orphan." During the commemorative rites that follow burial, the daughters-in-law or sons-in-law of the deceased often present their bereaved spouses with an awisiado to wear as a special means of "consolation," because "with the death of the person who gave them life, they will be lonely."36 Within this matrilineal society, in which a man and woman after marrying often continue to reside in their respective matrilineal households, the breastlike awisiado is emblematic of an Asante ideal of enduring maternal support that contin- ues well into adulthood. Its distinctive name and form express the mother's capacity to comfort the adult orphan. "Breasts are objects of joy," one senior Asante woman observed; "you drink from the breast and you become happy."37 Nana Afua Pokuaa, former queen mother of Amoman and a renowned dancer of the adosoa-kyekyere, the funeral procession in which the awisiado is formally presented, eloquently describes the ornament's sig- nificance: "The orphan is made like a newborn baby who is calling for breast milk whenever it is crying. When he is fed, he becomes relieved. This is awisiado. A child cries, 'Ngaa! Ngaa! Ngaa!' Then we say, 'Stop! Stop! Condolence!' We use this to wipe away the sorrow."38 Although the awisiado embodies the nurturing essence of motherhood, it expresses cultural ideals that transcend gender boundaries. Wearing the neck- lace signifies fertility, wealth, and sus- taining benevolence-laudable qualities in both women and men, as well as qual- ities long associated with the powers and responsibilities of Akan leadership. At Asante funerals, mourning for a father may be also expressed by wearing another gendered object: the atena ("net")- a simple head-covering consisting of a commercially produced hairnet, or a cro- cheted cap, that is embellished with a hol- low eggshell and other symbolic forms (Figs. 23, 24). The atena identifies the be- reaved children of a deceased father and commemorates his fruitful, successful life, for a deceased man is customarily praised for having fathered a substantial number of children.39 According to Nana Afua Pokuaa, the eggshell affixed to the center of these head-coverings signifies that "the children had eaten their last meal," as it is a father's duty to provide food for his wife and children. The prac- tice of tying a grey parrot's red tailfeather to the eggshell signifies the deep mourn- ing that follows the loss of such paternal care. The Asante associate the color red with great emotional distress, wearing red cloth following the loss of their closest relations. The parrot's red tailfeathers are suggestive of mourning attire, and the cries of a lone parrot are reminiscent of the distress of an abandoned orphan. Nana Afua Pokuaa explained the use of a parrot's tailfeather on the atena by observ- ing that "If a parrot is sitting on a tree, it says 'kaamo, kaamo'--if a parrot is sitting on a tree, it seems very pitiable."40 The atena, like the awisiado, expresses the sorrow of parental death by refer- encing ideals of parental sustenance. The atena attests to the deceased father's faithful fulfillment of customary obliga- tions to his wife and children. The awisia- do, which signifies the end of "maternal" nurturance by the death of a mother or father, is presented as a gesture of conso- lation for the "motherless orphan." In present-day Asante funerals, the awisiado appears more frequently than the relatively humble atena, a difference that may in part be due to the golden awisiado's historical and ongoing links with presti- gious court regalia. Its special appeal also arises from the particular resonance of nursing-mother imagery, which expresses an idealized maternal benevolence that transcends gender boundaries. In addi- tion, photographs of girls wearing awisia- do in unidentified ceremonial contexts are now available for sale as Asante cultural images (Fig. 25). This development, to- gether with the more recent emergence of the golden dual-disk pectoral in the funer- ary context, reveals the dynamic processes by which an evocative cultural symbol continues to be manifested in a society's visual art and culture.

"Traditional ruler" is a more inclusive and nuanced term than "chief," the designation that colonial administrators applied to all traditional office-holders. The indiscriminate use of this term, Kwame Arhin observes, "conceals real dif- ferences between the kinds of power or authority exercised by the various traditional office-holders [i.e., kings, queen mothers, paramount chiefs, chiefs, etc.]" (Arhin 1985:1). 3. Translations of Akan and Asante terms are based on Chris- taller 1933, unless otherwise noted. 4. A chain may be used in place of a fiber cord, as in the David gold dual-disk pectoral (see note 6) or the brass dual-disk pectoral pictured in Figure 2. The long-established nature of this horizontal suspension method has been documented by Barbot's 1679 drawings of Gold Coast ornaments and by gold ornaments recovered from the 1717 wreckage of the slave ship Whydah, as well as by those taken from the Asante capital by British troops in 1874. See Barbot 1992 (1678-1712): fig. 43, pl. opp. 494) and Ehrlich 1987:52-55. 5. For seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century Akan gold discoid beads, see fig. 43, opp. p. 494, in Barbot 1992, vol. 2; and Ehrlich 1987. For discoid forms and motifs in other Akan metalwork, see Kyerematen 1969-70, Ross 1974, and Silver- man 1983. The circular form may also be seen in the popular African factory-cloth design Nsubura ("Wells" or "Deep pools of water"), first introduced into Ghana during the 1930s (Nielsen 1974). 6. A dual-disk pectoral, from the Rend David Collection, was included in a recent exhibition at Pforzheim's Schmuck- museum and published in the exhibition catalogue Ife, Akan und Benin: Westafrikanische Kunst aus 2000 Jahren: Gold, Bronzen, Terrakotten (2000:121, fig. 63). Roy Sieber observed that certain African-art dealers report having acquired a lim- ited number of dual-disk chest ornaments (personal commu- nication, July 2001). 7. Ehrlich notes the difficulties in assigning a dual-disk origin to similar or even identical single-disk pectorals. One disk might be a replacement for an earlier, damaged disk, and what appears to be a matching pair of disks may simply be two single disks produced by the same workshop, as in a group of 1920-50 pectoral disks cast in the pattern akyekyedee akyi ("tortoise back") that are very similar in size, design, and workmanship (Martha Ehrlich, personal communication, May 2002). 8. It is interesting to note that each of two renowned illustra- tions of Asante regalia taken by British troops contains a pec- toral stripped of suspension materials; see "Ashantee golden ornaments and trophies," from the Illustrated London News, 1874; and "Trophies from Coomassie," The Graphic, April 11, 1874, reproduced in Fagg 1974:44-46, figs. 6, 9. 9. This bracelet was perhaps mentioned fifty years earlier by John Lock, who observed, on a Gold Coast voyage, that cer- tain women "weare in their bare armes certain foresleeves made of the plates of beaten golde" (in Blake 1942, vol. 2:343). 10. It has been suggested that the bracelet of this "noble- woman" may be an early form of the Akan "queen mother's bracelet" known as babadua, a name that refers to a segment- ed, bamboo-like cane whose toughness and great height are associated with the strength of the matrilineage and the ele- vated status and necessity of traditional rule. However, the two circular disks in the 1602 engravings are substantially larger than the circular terminals of nineteenth- and twenti- eth-century babadua (Garrard 1989:71). Given the ethnohistor- ical accuracy and precision of detail associated with De Marees' text and copperplate engravings (see Iselin 1994), it is highly unlikely that the prominence of the 1602 disks should be attributed to fanciful European exaggeration; and al- though babadua seems an appropriate name for the cane-like "knots" formed by the two circular terminals of the later "queen mother's bracelet," this name seems a less likely match for the extremely large disks of the bracelets in De Marees' engravings. 11. Osei Tutu, before his late-seventeenth-century rise to power as the founding ruler of the Asante kingdom, spent time in the courts of the Denkyira and Akwamu, the two dominant powers of the time. Here the future Asantehene is believed to have acquired knowledge of statecraft and royal ritual, including probable inspiration for the sacred Golden Stool, whose miraculous descent from the heavens closely parallels the heavenly origin of the earlier Precious Bead Stool of the Denkyira (Bravmann 1968:4; Wilks 1989:110-12). 12. Doran Ross, personal communication, October 2002. Among the different articulations of the Asante concept of sunsum ("spirit"), I have found the most compelling to be that of Hagan, who describes sunsum as a spiritual "essence" to which "an intrinsic principle of activity" is attributed (1964:24). 13. See Meyerowitz 1951: fig. 2; Ehrlich 1981, vol. 1:140-41; Tufuo &amp; Donkor 1989:62; Boaten 1993:65-66, pl. 33; Ayensu 1997:139; and Ross 1998:43, fig. 3.13. 14. Ross has pointed out what appears to be a king wearing a dual-disk pectoral on the lid of the British Museum's Barclay- Armitage kuduo. The representational anomalies-scarifica- tion and bare feet-associated with the king's image on this nineteenth- or early-twentieth-century vessel make it difficult to assess the meaning of such ornamentation in this particu- lar context (personal communication, May 2002). See McLeod 1979, especially illustration 9. 15. See Beverly Stoeltje's discussion of the relationship be- tween symbolic motherhood and Asante queen mothers' "moral authority" (1997:57-59). 16. There are no records of female abirempon displays, but that does not mean such an event never occurred or that such a gendered term was not applied to such a woman. See Clark's discussion of the contemporary term ,baa barima ("manly or brave woman"), used for a market woman who "had achieved the level of financial success and economic independence considered essential for men" (1999:722). 17. According to the Bowdich Glossary, the "benda" was val- ued at ?9 currency in 1819. 18. The complete prayer is "Anguioume, mami maro, mamd orie, mame chike occori, mame akaka, mame Brembi, mame angouan i aounsan" (Loyer 1935 [1714]:213). It may be translated as "My God [Anguioume (Onyame)], give me rice, give me yams, give me gold [chike (sika)] and precious beads [occori (kori)], give me slaves [akakal, give me wealth [Brembi, i.e., obirempon sta- tus], give me health and fitness" (see Kea 1981:177). 19. VisonA, in analyzing late-twentieth-century regalia prac- tices in Lagoons cultures, observed that "every man and woman may aspire to gold ownership." She notes that the ability to display gold objects during certain festivals often "entitles a man to special privileges as well as bestowing upon him a title usually translated as 'king' " (1987:299, 306-7). Garrard also draws our attention to the public display of gold by "big men" in the Lagoons region of southeastern C6te d'Ivoire, a practice described in the 1873 account of Fleuriot de Langle (1989:106-8). 20. The Asante akonkofoo, who had fled to the coast in the 1880s and 1890s to establish their own inheritable wealth, free of the Asante state's system of death duties, did return to Kumase following the 1896 British defeat and exile of the Asantehene (Arhin 1986). Although the akonkofoa had shak- en off the historical ideology governing state regulation of wealth, McCaskie notes that "they were still enmeshed-as their descendants are-in the received (if modified) cul- tural imagery of behaving like a 'big man', an obirempon" (1986:8). 21. In Kumase, the assumption of "royal" prerogatives by members of the moneyed rather than royal elite is a point of contention that has continued to the present day, as in the restrictions concerning the wearing of ahenemma mpaboa (royal sandals) by nonroyals at ceremonial and rit- ual gatherings. 22. In recent years, due to formal education and Christianity, female nubility rites have become increasingly abbreviated or have been abandoned altogether (Sarpong 1977:94-95; Obeng 1991:284). In 1990 the prestigious dress displays cus- tomarily associated with girls' bragoro appeared in a new coming-of-age context, in the succession of new ensembles Kumase girls donned for a series of photographic portraits, made following their Form 4 graduation class picture (Gott 1994:200-203). In certain Asante villages, a colleague wit- nessed "mock" bragoro rites, staged as cultural re-enactments by local female elders, under the sponsorship of governmen- tal community development agencies-further indication of the abbreviation or abandonment of custom in late-twenti- eth-century Asante (Barbara Stucki, personal communication, March 1990). 23. A similar occasion on which nonroyal females are tem- porarily honored in the manner of Asante royalty occurs after a woman gives birth, particularly for the first time. For her public reentry into society, the new mother is accompanied by attendants and adorned with a distinctive golden necklace popularly known as ahene komate ("chiefs' necklace"). See Gott 1994:205-11, and Garrard 1989:10 for an example of this type of royal necklace. 24. In Kumase, the decoration of the wake-keeping chamber is often the work of hired professionals. These decorators pro- vide the lace and kente cloth for draping the walls of the chamber, as well as a special brass bed for the deceased and additional room decorations, such as lamps, strings of lights, and artificial or fresh flowers. 25. See Arhin 1994, Manuh 1995, and De Witte 2001 for recent examinations of Asante funerals. Manuh in particular focus- es on the role of marital relationships with respect to funeral obligations. 26.

Interview with Nana Afua Pokuaa, former queen mother of Amoman, Kumase, July 1999. 28. Rattray's brief description of a more humble form of adosoa procession, with "male futuo," or fotoo ("a bag of gold dust, or money") and "female adosowa" bundles, is notable for his documentation of gendered funerary bundles and the capacity of these bundles to be possessed by the spirit of the deceased during the course of the procession (1927:174). Gendered adosoa bundles, and their potential for possession, remain a feature of certain contemporary adosoa ritual pro- cessions and are the subject of my current research. 29. Meyerowitz writes briefly of a similar "adosowa funeral custom," performed for Asante royalty, that featured a beau- tiful female Adosoahene (Adosoa king) and other female dancers dressed in male attire, who "in olden days" imitated fighting warriors-an activity later replaced by "swaggering about in men's cloths and smoking cigarettes" (1951:71). 30. These funeral dance processions offer an opportunity for co-wife rivalry. Professor Opoku recalled one such occasion, on which a female relative was surprised by her co-wife's last-minute challenge: instead of the planned co-sponsored adosoa, each of them should stage her own adosoa-kyekyere for their bereaved husband. Despite the short notice his aunt was able to pull together an outstanding adosoa by calling upon the local chief for the loan of his kete drums and regalia. Her feat provided clear evidence of her social standing and supe- rior social connections (interview with Professor Albert Mawere Opoku, University of Ghana, Legon, July 1999; see also Arhin 1994:316). 31. For a more recent image of an Adisoahemaa dancer wear- ing the awisiado pectoral, see Fisher 1984:92 and Beckwith &amp; Fisher 1996:41. This particular dancer was, in fact, a member of the adisoa dance troupe of adosoa specialist Nana Afua Pokuaa, former queen mother of Amoman. During my July 1999 interview in Kumase with Nana Pokuaa, she informed me that dressing the Adosoahemaa in such a manner was largely a feature of earlier dance processions. 32. Clark notes that when Asante fathers show the kind of devotion associated with motherhood, "they are praised as good mothers, not fathers" (1999:721). Allman and Tashjian provide historical evidence of "nursing" terms applied to especially devoted fathering (2000:95, 99). 33. Rattray noted that six anthropomorphic wooden figures, one armed with a knife, were arranged around the headless and armless breasted trunk, ready to aid in apprehending and defeating witches (1927:32). 34. See Proverb 415, p. 115, in Rattray 1969 [1916], an anno- tated translation of selected proverbs from Christaller's 1879 collection of Asante and Fante proverbs. In his notes, Rattray observes that the word nufu (lit., "breast") serves as a metonym for nufu nsu ("breast milk"). See also Christaller 1933:353. 35. Interview with Mr. M.H.
