<plain_text><page sequence="1">Piranesi in Petrograd: Sources, Strategies, and Dilemmas in Modernist Depictions of the Ruins (1918-1921) Polina Barskova The Unbearable Pleasure of Ruins The celebrated artist and architect of Italian pre-Romanticism, Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), known primarily for his depictions of the dilapidated ruins of Rome (see figure 1), never reached St. Petersburg in person. Nevertheless, he managed to participate in the creation of the cityscape in absentia by influencing one of Petersburg's chief builders, French architect Thomas de Tomon, who designed the famous Stock Ex- change building (1805-1810) . Thus, it could be said that Piranesi's vision lay hidden for centuries in the architectural text of Petersburg only to be paradoxically developed by the city's postrevolutionary fate. Many witnesses experienced and described the years from 1918 to 1921 as a period of devastation and crisis for Petrograd. Indeed, the city lost two-thirds of its population between 1916 and 1920.2 There was no electricity or transportation; hunger, disease, and filth plagued the city. The lack of fuel led to a heating crisis: during the winters of 1918-1920, Petrograd's central heating did not function at all.3 As a result, during the first years following the October revolution, Petersburg was falling apart or, more precisely, was being taken apart by its citizens. Because of the fuel crisis, Petrograd's citizens saw themselves forced to dismantle wooden houses and wooden walkways for firewood, leaving behind only stoves in- stead of houses, and holes instead of sidewalks. Soviet literature's enfant terrible, Viktor Shklovskii, in his bitter and explicit essay "Peterburg v blokade" (Petersburg during the blockade, 1921), describes the virtual fragmentation of the city and its transformation into a chaotic residue consisting of the remains and the lacunae that divide and alternate with each other. "Wooden buildings were dismantled and burned. Big build- ings devoured small ones. Deep gaps emerged in the lines of the streets. People carried out the demolition weakly and ineptly. Artificial ruins made their appearance. The city slowly began to transform itself into an engraving by Piranesi."4 I would like to thank Olga Matich, Eric Naiman, Andreas Sch6nle, Luba Golburt, Maria Joaquina Villasenor, and the anonymous readers for their astute comments, patience, and generosity. 1.

Inserting Piranesi into the Petrograd text is not just a typically provocative Shklovskian montage of culturally remote phenomena, but a symptomatic moment that lays bare one of the central devices of the texts describing "the end of Petersburg"-creating an aesthetic filter between the observer and the painful reality.5 Here I consider the sometimes con- tradictory strategies involved in creating such a filter, with the distancing and embracing of destruction being the main models. An indication of one of the epoch's central artistic tensions-the necessary choice be- tween aesthetic containment of and direct contact with the historical trauma- can be found by examining the appearance of Piranesi's cult of ruins among the Petersburg authors of 1918-1921. 5. V. N. Toporov, in his field-defining article "The Petersburg Text of Russian Litera- ture," in Peterburgskii tekst russkoi literatury: Izbrannye trudy (St. Petersburg, 2003), 7-66, points out that the prophecy of disaster was a leitmotif unifying the texts about the city into one body. The artistic texts of Petersburg thus react to the eschatological mythology; the anticipation of the end defines these texts thematically and structurally. Accepting Toporov's idea that Petersburg's texts function as a complex unity, I suggest treating the texts of the city created between 1917 and 1935 as a separate system that, in spite of its obvious kinship to the system Toporov described, operates according to laws of its own. The main distinction between these two sets of texts is their relationship to the "end" of Petersburg: while the former treats this event as a cerebral notion, the latter is compelled by its reality. Thus, projections give way to reactions.</page><page sequence="3">696 Slavic Review What happens to the Piranesian desire to re-create and savor the ru- ins of the past when the temporal distance between the disaster and the gaze disappears, and the impulse of aestheticization is aimed toward a de- struction that directly threatens the author and his environment? One of my central tasks is to explore the strategies, successes, failures, and dan- gers of this impulse to beautify the catastrophe, and the consequences of this impulse for the aesthetic principle that young Mikhail Bakhtin for- mulated as the author's outsidedness (vnenakhodimost') with respect to the reality that he happens to observe and chooses to depict.6 I look at three models for representing the disaster of Petersburg after the October rev- olution: first, the attempt to represent the disaster as a safe and distant part of the Romantic canon; second, the authorial self-sacrifice in the ser- vice of a homogenizing identification with the maimed city; and finally, the attempt to synthesize the former approaches by inscribing the autho- rial figure into Petersburg's literary cityscape. The immediate rhetorical effect of Shklovskii's framing of the ruina- tion of Petrograd as an aesthetic project is striking because of its ambitious elegance: by comparing Petersburg's sad remains to artificial ruins, the Soviet writer robs history of its authority. Shklovskii subverts the disaster's negative power by declaring himself the coauthor of-if not a competitor with-history's action. Revolution and its aftermath turn the city into ru- ins, and Shklovskii, challenging the very status of the catastrophe, declares these ruins to be a premeditated simulacrum. What upset Shklovskii was apparently not the deconstruction itself but its "weak" and "inept" means and tempo. Thus for Shklovskii, with his zeal for the futurists' destructive politics and poetics, turning Petersburg into ruins would preferably hap- pen much faster and more efficiently. But which aspects of Piranesi's work attracted Shklovskii first and foremost? To address this question, it is im- portant to consider the multiple dilemmas that Piranesi's oeuvre poses. First, does the ruin belong to the past or to the present moment? And if to both, what rhetorical mechanism bridges the two eras? Was Piranesi's goal to reconstruct reality or to create instances of "beautiful unfaithful- ness" to reality? 7 Finally, how does Piranesi's notion of the beautiful ruin engage with the gruesome matter of destruction? These are the central is- sues that will guide my exploration of the various ways Petersburg's artists responded to the Piranesian paradigm. Here, it is crucial to distinguish between the function of Piranesian depictions of the ruins of Rome and the treatment of the ruins of Petro- grad by Shklovskii and his contemporaries. While Piranesi aimed at draw- ing the past (for which the ruins serve as synecdoche) closer to his pres- 6. The category of vnenakhodimost' is central for Bakhtin's early philosophy; it is espe- cially prominent in Avtor i geroi v esteticheskoi deiatel'nosti (Kiev, 1994). For commentary on the genesis of this notion, see S. Averintsev, L. Gogotishvili, V. Liapunov, V. Makhlin, and N. Nikolaev, "Kommentarii," in M. M. Bakhtin, Sobranie sochinenii v semi tomakh, ed. S.

Though we delight in them they seem like a beautiful unfaithfulness." Quoted in A. Hyatt Mayor, Piranesi (New York, 1952), 27.</page><page sequence="4">Piranesi in Petrograd 697 Figure 2. Pavel Shillingovskii, Litovskii zamok i rynok v 1921 godu, 1923. ent moment, the artists of Petrograd needed to distance themselves from the ruins of their present. Ironically, in both cases the goal was achieved by means of aesthetization: Piranesi seduced the audience of proto-Romanticism with the ambiguous beauty of the dilapidated Roman aqueducts. As such, they were reread, reinterpreted, and included into the discourse of modernity. Not so figuratively speaking, these ruins pro- vided a foundation for the palimpsest that we know as the gothic genre, an inalienable part of Romantic discourse. But for Piranesi's Soviet fol- lowers, his depiction of the ruins as art objects was the most resourceful way to exclude this reality from temporal proximity: being likened to the remains of Rome, the remains of Petrograd lessened their grip over Shklovskii's contemporaries. Not surprisingly, Shklovskii was not the only observer of the deformed city who used Piranesi's works as his point of reference and inspira- tion. The deconstruction of the city represented as a method of its beau- tification can also be seen in the etchings of Shklovskii's contemporary and fellow-townsman, the distinguished graphic artist Pavel Shillingovskii (1881-1942) (see figure 2).8 In 1923, Shillingovskii published Peterburg, ruiny i vozrozhdenie (Peters- burg: Ruins and reconstruction), a book of etchings that reveals his clear predilection for ruins, in which he lovingly depicts the new beauty of the city: a peculiar combination of empty, nearly peopleless urban spaces and destroyed buildings and monuments. In Shillingovskii's etchings, human 8. For a detailed description of Shillingovskii's oeuvre, see E. V Grishina, P. A. Shil- lingovskii (Leningrad, 1980).</page><page sequence="5">698 Slavic Review subjects virtually crawl about the ruins completely overpowered by the magnitude and solemnity of destruction. The point of view that Shilling- ovskii inherits from Piranesi reveals the city as if from a distance and from above. When Aldous Huxley saw Piranesi's Views of Rome, he remarked on this perspective with dark irony: "Men and women are reduced to the stature of children, horses become as small as mastiffs. This city is peopled by dwarfs."' The authorial position of detachment and subjugation of the material being described serves many functions, with self-anaesthetization being one of the most important. The desire to assuage the painful reality with soothing cultural mod- els gripped very diverse witnesses of Petersburg's disaster. For ex- ample, the famous anarchist Emma Goldman, who visited the city in 1921, recounts: Petrograd of 1920 was almost in ruins, as if a hurricane had swept over it. The houses looked like broken old tombs upon neglected and forgotten cemeteries. The streets were dirty and deserted; all life had gone from them. The people walked about like living corpses. The utter stillness of the large city was paralyzing. It fairly haunted me, this awful oppressive silence... I would lay awake trying to pierce the mystery.'0 Goldman's description of the crumbling, silent, and cemetery-like city that induces terror in the visitor can be traced back to the eerie gothic landscapes and castles that horrified their meek female visitors and were presented as mysteries asking to be unraveled." Another illustration can be found in The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), where Ann Radcliffe describes the "splendidly and emblematically decaying"'2 Udolpho castle: "Emily gazed with melancholy awe upon the castle: the gothic greatness of its fea- tures, and its moldering walls of dark gray stone, rendered it a gloomy and sublime object. As the twilight deepened, its features became more awful in obscurity ... Grass and wild plants had taken root among the molder- ing stones and seemed to sigh over the desolation among them."' In keeping with the once popular idiom of Ruinlust, a pre-Romantic obses- sion with ruins, the decrepit, mysterious castle induces contradictory feel- ings in the heroine: she finds it at once sad, awesome, sublime, gloomy, and obscure. This double sensibility may serve as an emblem for the gothic genre that sought to make the most out of the dark lining of the Romantics' cloud. Among Petrograd authors, masking the Petrograd of that time in a rhetorical costume in the gothic mode became somewhat commonplace. This practice confirms my paradigm of Petrograd between 1918 and 1921 as a Piranesian space; indeed, what population would be more appropri- 9.

This rhetoric was used by the authors connected to the stylistic systems of Rus- sian "post-Romanticism," such as the acmeist Nikolai Gumilev, who prophetically saw hidden corpses in the Neva: Ascend the bridge and look down at the waters of the Neva River This is how the secret cellars smell, Where the corpses are hidden, where the toads roam.'4 Quite similarly, Igor' Severianin, "the king of poets," wrote in 1918: The agonizing Petrograd! A nightmarish ghost-city! A revolting slave! A living dead man! 15 After all, both Gumilev and Severianin were heirs to the Romantic poet- ics to which ghosts belonged. More unexpectedly, however, the same im- agery can be found in the works of an entirely different group of writers. Soviet journalist Adol'f Men'shoi states: Now Death wanders amidst these towers and palaces. Death ... Our city has turned into a cemetery. Ancient styles of empire and baroque are dead. The rotten pavement is covered with grass. Deadening silence blows over the Palace Embankment. The Neva radiates its deadening phosphor during white nights. Ghosts walk the dead city. Yesterday on the embankment I met the ghost of the architect Rastrelli-he was walk- ing along the pavement among the broken, trembling flagstones torn from the ground. ... Petersburg left us broken coffins, ruins, mold, and moss.16 My reading of the Petrograd authors' penchant for "dark Romanticism" is informed by Eric Naiman's notion of the Red gothic.'7 Naiman suggests that behind the Soviet ideological discourse's borrowing of gothic lan- guage, imagery, and structures stood the inability to rhetorically process the fear of the necessity to differentiate between past and present. Ac- cording to Naiman, the gothic emerges out of a dual fear-that the past will return, and that it is gone forever, leaving one to cope with a frightful and confusing present. The construction of the Petrograd authors' ver- sion of the Red gothic thus blurs dichotomies: fear and desire become in- distinguishable from each other, and the border between the past and the present becomes porous. Soviet journalist Adol'f Men'shoi insists, "Please understand, we don't live in the city-we live in something transitional. Petersburg doesn't exist anymore. Leningrad doesn't exist yet. Petersburg is the irrevocable past. Leningrad is the future. And what we have now is 14. Nikolai Gumilev, "Ledokhod," in M.

In terms of representation, this tran- sitional moment becomes a symbolically permeable wall through which the imagery of the tamed horrors from discourses long forgotten pour into the text of a freezing and starving Petrograd. Stage design was yet another key site of Piranesi's widespread aesthetic influence.'9 Both Shklovskii's remark about the city "that was turning into an artificial ruin" and Shillingovskii's empty spaces are reminders of the idea of the stage set. This theatrical space could be seen as a "haunted city," a close relative of the classic haunted castle of the gothic writers.20 This idea of Petrograd in the 1920s as a haunted city echoes the descrip- tion set forth in Peter Fritzsche's Stranded in the Present. Here, Fritzsche connects the rhetorical images of the haunted space to the historical anx- ieties of the past: "The Gothic topos of the haunted house resonates with half-repressed memory of cultural defeats, and particular haunted places stand for compression and concretization of historical time."22 Clearly, Petrograd was predisposed to being read as a haunted stage set-for cen- turies, this city was perceived to possess a theatrical aura.22 The siege of Petrograd in 1918-1921 reinforced this vision by emptying and darken- ing the city's spacious streets. Perhaps predictably, artists filled these stage sets with ghosts, figures of imagination that embody both an acute nostal- gia for the past and the eerie sensation of connectedness between past and present. In order to categorize the disaster aesthetically, both Shklovskii's Pe- tersburg during the Blockade and Shillingovskii's etchings obscure the fact that the apocalyptic prophecies of the Petersburg myth came true. This aesthetization likely provided some comfort, allowing artists to observe the troubled city through a lens of premade discourses and to gaze upon the city as though looking at an illustration from an old book. It is ap- propriate here to note that both Shillingovskii and Shklovskii called their destroyed city "Petersburg," not "Petrograd." In addition to the log- ical reason that the 200-year-old name meant incomparably more to the citizens than the Slavophile version introduced in 1914, there was another explanation: Petersburg was primarily a literary city, a city-text. While the real city was founded on the marshes, the fictional city of Pe- 18. Men'shoi, "Peterburg-Leningrad," 25. 19.

In a way, Petersburg was an artificial ruin from its very beginning.23 Significantly, the use of gothic imagery by the witnesses of the Russian revolution echoes the situation around the French Revolution, one of the greatest inspirations for the Romantic revival of the gothic genre. Petro- grad artists of the most acute aesthetic sensibilities understood that these two revolutions were connected; for example, Mikhail Kuzmin proudly exclaims: "The Russian revolution doesn't follow anything, its only brother is French!'"24 This parallel points to the way that revolutionary vi- olence and change engender fears and anxieties that find expression in the whimsical iconography of the gothic. In his Gothic Sublime, Vijay Mishra writes: "As a dark metaphor of the mind or, more accurately, as the symbolization of the repressed structures of unconscious, the Gothic is a ready medium through which a reality of the French revolution may be sublimated and fears about it rechanneled through the discourses of art. "25 This observation aptly demonstrates the probable reason for Pet- rograd artists' borrowing from Piranesi and other dark Romantics. The at- tempt to translate revolutionary terror into artistic terms can be under- stood as the basic impulse of their project. With the introduction of the gothic transposition and the interchangeability of fear and desire in the mind of the subject of history, terror is undermined, blurred, made am- bivalent and distant.26 Now, another important feature of the gothic that may add to the value of this discourse should be touched upon. Ann Radcliffe, one of the most important gothic authors and the creator of the gothic novel of "sense and sensibility," attempts to create a clear distinction between "ter- ror" and "horror." "Terror and horror are so far opposite, that the first ex- pands the soul, and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts, freezes and nearly annihilates them."27 According to Rad- cliffe, the kind of "terror" that she simultaneously depicts and uses as a 23.

Beginning with the texts chronologically and structurally akin to William Blake's allegory "The French Revolution" (1791, "In the tower named Order, an old man ... his den was short and narrow as a grave dug for a child, with spiders' webs wove, and with slime of ancient horrors covered, for snakes and scorpions are his companions"), the discourses of the revolution and the gothic become intertwined. For analyses of the gothic as a consequence and a symptom of revolution, see Francis Barker, Jay Bernstein, and Peter Hulme, eds., 1789: Reading Writing Revolution (Essex, 1982); Paula Rea Radisich, "Hubert Robert and the Revolution," Hubert Robert: Painted Spaces oftheEnlightenment (Cambridge, Eng., 1998), 117-40.

What is this higher degree? How can it be defined, achieved, and, per- haps, peeped into? The very curiosity suggested by these questions overwhelms Radcliffe's unexpected successor Emma Goldman when she confesses: "I would lay awake trying to pierce the mystery." Goldman's desire to look through the darkness of the Petrograd night can be read as a characteristic sign of "the end of Petersburg" authors' treatment of their object: in order to "present the unpresentable," they wanted to penetrate, to explore, to depict, and thus, to subjugate the horrifying city. Following Radcliffe's dichotomy, their enterprise was to turn the city as a producer of horror into the city as a collection of handmade terrors. Let us now return to the question of Piranesi. One of the most per- ceptive and provocative recent readings of Piranesi's work belongs to Bar- bara Stafford, who points out: Piranesi used his etching needle as a creative surgical tool to uncover in- formation about an otherwise irretrievable past.... He uncovered and retrieved the decaying body of the ancient and modern city: flayed bod- ies became analogous for temples peeled of their marble. The architect felt out structure through pointing "fingers" of light and shade, sharp and faint focus. Piranesi transplanted "surgical" strategies into the do- main of archaeological publication. He made use of accidental holes or "wounds" gaping in the sides of deteriorating masonry to allow glimpses of their internal structure.28 Stafford's comparison between the graphic artist who etches the ruins and the anatomist who flays the corpse in order to see its innards parallels the strategies of Petrograd writers of the period in question. Konstantin Vaginov writes, "The walls of the houses are half-transparent. Some of the houses have disappeared; some lie in ruins. Behind the transparent walls sit the transparent people."29 Shklovskii provides the following de- scription: "The tombs of the old houses opened. The scaffold on Nevskii Prospect was removed and burnt and the old houses again showed their old, dead walls.""' Osip Mandel'shtam adds, "One has only to remove the film from the Petersburg air then its hidden stratum will be laid bare. Un- der the French pastries of the dying quays, there will be revealed some- thing completely unexpected."3' Vaginov, Mandel'shtam, and Shklovskii elaborate on the possibilities presented by the city that has been flayed and laid bare by violence; they 28.

This position of artistic surveillance over the object of de- piction can be read in the context of Bakhtin's concept of vnenakhodi- most' that provides the theoretical grounding for my study: "The funda- mental, aesthetically productive relationship between the author and the hero is one in which the author occupies an intently maintained position of outsidedness with respect to space, time, value, and meaning. This po- sition enables the author to collect and concentrate all of the hero, who, from within himself, is diffused and dispersed in the projected world of cognition."32 For Bakhtin, the divorce between the author and the object serves a productive narrative purpose: it helps the author overcome the fragmentary nature of perception "from within." But however useful out- sidedness might be with respect to a narrative, one cannot help wonder- ing to what extent this concept was a part of Bakhtin's overall strategy to exempt the agent of the discourse from becoming a subject of this over- powering discourse. Mikhail K. Ryklin muses about such dynamics in Bakhtin's later work on Francois Rabelais: Bakhtin's book on Rabelais has always impressed me as being a self- therapeutic text, related more to some biographical trauma than to the object under investigation. This process (enacting and overcoming of the unavoidable trauma) showed itself in Bakhtin in two fundamental procedures: distancing and infinite jubilation. Distance is created by transforming the plane of content, which is the visible reality of terror, into the rhetorical canon of the speech body. As a result, terror becomes intransitive, and speech, in contrast, becomes absolutely transitive, im- manently containing the entire world.33 Shklovskii's and Shillingovskii's narratives of "outsidedness" depict the au- thors' immediate reality as if from a distance of complex intertextuality and also overcome fragmentation. This approach, however, may leave the reader wondering whether the authors' relationship to their city in this model is not somewhat violent, as if by trying to compete with history the artists have become infected with its ways? And what about the by- products of the authorial super-vision, for example, the remains of the city that were cut open? The remains that do not fit submissively into the puzzle of authorial intention belong to a different model of the relationship be- tween the author and his destroyed environment. Here, the author does not remove himself from the disturbed reality by means of aesthetic fram- ing but allows himself to undergo the same painful structural changes as this reality itself and chooses to register the pain instead of soothing it.

In Byron's poem, the autobiographical hero and the urbanscape be- come, not just alike, but homogeneous: they merge. The human subject is not depicted as a troubled and doomed ant running over spectacular stones; on the contrary, the significance of the human subject in the text is reinforced through the transference of the authorial position into the text. The author abandons the narratively secure position of the observer and enters his troubled text. I see this strategy of establishing the close-up of the disaster as antithetical to the strategy employed by the Petrograd followers of Piranesi. Some Petersburg authors preferred the Byronian position of the "ruin amidst ruins" to Piranesian remoteness. A visual example of this is the superimposed fragmented body of the city and the deformed human body seen in the self-portrait by the "Bard of Leningrad's Outskirts," Semen Pavlov (1893-1941) (see figure 3). What is perhaps most striking in this self-representation is that the artist has clearly rewritten the centuries-old genre wherein the portrait is in- scribed into the architectural frame.35 Instead, the violation of the harmonious symmetry in Pavlov's picture is immediately noticeable; here the human body is truncated and decen- tered. Although the face recalls the countenances of medieval saints and warriors, the fact that his body is cropped and skewed marks the poignant relationship between this self-portrait and the tradition that generated it.36 Instead of the portico evoking a halo, the subject is framed by the di- lapidated shed, and overall, the viewer faces the distressingly fragmented urbanscape of Petrograd's outskirts instead of a sublime architectural composition in the background, as the viewer may expect. And the sub- ject cannot be completely distinguished from the city that he inhabits and describes. This blurring of the self as painter, the self as subject of depic- tion, and the city background constitutes an important structural element of the depictions of the deformed Petrograd, a city robbed of a salutary aesthetic distancing. Peculiarly, Shklovskii himself becomes involved in this unpitying per- spective, as well. The dream of replacing his own body with the city's serves as Shklovskii's forced solution for the heating crisis in Petrograd: "If I had wooden arms and legs, I would have heated my house with them- 34.

For example, Eugenie A. Korvin-Kroukovsky recalls: 37. Shklovskii, "Peterburg v blokade," 27. The fact that he uses both strategies in the same text-distancing himself from the disaster and, in contrast, establishing his maxi- mum possible proximity, to the extent of blurring and assimilation-reveals an unstable artistic position when faced with this traumatic choice. On the unstable authorial self in the trauma narrative, see James Meffan, "Terror, Writing and Responsibility," in Gerrit-Jan Berendse and Mark Williams, eds., Terror and Text: Representing Political Violence in Literature and the Visual Arts (Bielefeld, 2002), 37- 61. 38.

The court house, with all its win- dows broken, looked like a man whose eyes had been put out."39 While, according to Stafford, the comparison between the city ruin and the human body formed part of the basic significance and influ- ence of Piranesi and his school, the Petrograd followers of this tradi- tion took one major step forward: the image of the author of the simile was included in the picture. In this context, not only was the author a surgeon in the anatomical theater, but in a paradoxically bifurcated self- perception, simultaneously a corpse under the scalpel of this surgeon. Perhaps the similarity between the maimed city and the maimed citizen became visible to the author because, in that moment, he himself was this citizen, he himself was maimed. In this instance, the emphasis shifted to- ward the author's "I" and the self-portrait among ruins may be called the genre par excellence of this situation. The downside to this approach of representing the deformation was that the destruction of the cityscape and its subject/author inevitably led to the complete destruction of the narrative and an absence of historical perspective. Such narratives lack coherency and serve as reminders of the fragmented city line in Shklov- skii's rendition, where "deep gaps emerged in the lines of the streets." Searching to free the ruins of the city from the connective tissues of the past, the authors endeavored to introduce anthropomorphization into their descriptions of the city, but this strategy undermines the continuity of history and the continuity of narrative and robs the recipient of the text of any hope of textual recuperation. Long before the ruination of Petersburg, a witness to the devastation caused by the French Revolution, Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand, wrote on the distinction between the ruins of nature and the ruins of history: "The latter exhibit nothing but the image of annihilation, without any reparative power, they resemble hoary hair on the head of youth. The de- structions of man are besides, much more violent and much more com- plete than those of time: the latter undermine, the former demolish."40 Chateaubriand's description also uses an anthropomorphic image, com- paring the ruins of history to premature old age. The notion of the pre- maturely disrupted flow of history appears to be inscribed into the dis- course of the ruins of the present and, indeed, becomes the most trying challenge for those who attempt to represent it. Rhetorically, the strongest attempts to establish the similarity between the ruins of the city and the tortured body of the author can be seen in Shklovskii's introduction of the figure of the "explosion" of Petersburg in his experimental wartime travelogue Sentimental'noe puteshestvie (1923): "In the middle of January 1918, I returned to Petersburg. The city has grown quiet. Like after an explosion, when it's all over, when everything is 39. Eugenie A. Korvin-Kroukovsky, Diary, Hoover Institution Archives, 71011-10, V.9. Quoted in E.

Like a man whose insides have been torn out by an explo- sion."41 Because explosions were not historically among the main reasons for the city's devastation, the sources of this powerful image must lie else- where. This fictional event has two lines of origin: the first is biographical substitution. Here, Shklovskii recalls an episode from the battle on the banks of the Dneper where a hand grenade detonated in his hands: "Probably I accidentally lit the paper wrapped around the safety fuse. My arms were flung back; I was lifted, seared and turned head over heals. The cylinder had blown up in my hands. My arms and clothes were all in shreds and holes. The soldiers heard the explosion and said: 'There it is. Shklov- skii has blown himself up!'"'42 Shklovskii "explodes" his city when echoing his bodily memories of suffering; he turns his city into himself thus dis- solving the difference between the subject and the agent of the textual process. The second layer of Shklovskii's depiction of the disaster of Pe- tersburg as a result of an explosion, however, is quite different. In all prob- ability, Shklovskii's description alludes to the most influential Russian modernist text of the city-Andrei Belyi's novel Petersburg (1916)-where the protagonist Nikolai Ableukhov declares: "I became the bomb, with a ticking in my belly!"43 Belyi's novel describes one of the most politically excruciating moments in the history of Petersburg at the turn of the cen- tury, the aftermath of the revolution of 1905 during the peak of the ter- rorist movement. In the novel, Belyi juxtaposes this historical reality with one of the central plots of the Petersburg text: the opposition between the "little man" and the power of history embodied in the figure of Etienne Maurice Falconet's Bronze Horseman, the mighty and terrifying statue of Peter the First. Two plots, the bombers' conspiracy to kill a high state official, Apollon Ableukhov, and the cerebral duel between the bomber Dudkin and the Bronze Horseman become intertwined in the text. Shklovskii, an attentive reader of Belyi, writes: "Belyi creates several planes. One of them is solid, nearly real; the others seem to be just shad- ows of the first one. But suddenly the shadows become real and the plane of reality turns out to be just an accident."44 The pervasive bomb that Dudkin puts in the Senator's house does not kill any protagonists, but perhaps more important for the text, it does turn the story of the city into fragments. In Belyi's novel there is no place for any coherence or wholeness. Indeed, the leading characters have split identities: Nikolai Ableukhov becomes the surreal Red Domino and Lip- panchenko, the mastermind of terrorists, turns out to be a double agent, a police informer. But the textual fragmentation runs even deeper. Olga Matich compares Belyi's novel to the cubist painting where "the narration shatters the represented world into fragments with the purpose of re- 41.

Some of the word paintings pro- duced by Belyi can be compared to an explosion of traditional represen- tational forms, as if mimicking the effect created by the bomb." 45 By recycling Belyi's representation of explosion on multiple textual levels, Shklovskii transfers the various interconnected meanings of the city's fragmentation outlined by Belyi into his own description of Petro- grad in 1918. The most important of these meanings are fragmentation as a result of the apocalyptic catastrophe that is encoded in the Petersburg text;46 fragmentation as a result of revolutionary violence;47 and frag- mentation as a condition of modernity. Because David Bethea has con- vincingly studied the function of apocalyptic discourse in Russian mod- ernism, and in particular, in Belyi's novel, I focus on the structural fragmentation in the texts of Petersburg that searched for adequate means of representing a close-up of their painful present moment. In a way, such texts were doomed to lack textual coherency due to their denial of outsidedness since according to the scholar of modernity Linda Nochlin, "the fragmentariness is a quality shared in the modern city by both the perceiver/constructor and the object of perception."'48 As long as the authors endeavored to write themselves into their texts, their subjectivity would explode their narratives, a situation that was only aggravated by the traumatic nature of their experience. In his Narrative and Freedom, Gary Saul Morson diagnoses this narrative problem as one of the "diseases of presentness," the isolated present: "In this situation pres- ent grows so intense that it almost banishes both memory and anticipa- tion. Only now matters and now is so overwhelmingly powerful ... that it seems like a temporal island, entirely cut off from life in past and fu- ture ... the moment of infinite temporal density is reached."49 The an- thropomorphous and anthropo-centered ruins of Petrograd were in- fected by the "disease of presentness" and as such, they differed drastically from Piranesian efforts to establish continuity between the past and the present by representing a "petrified melancholia."50 The city destroyed by the present and the city-text destroyed by presentness needed a new means of cohesion, new principles for organizing the textual shrapnel. 45.

For example, the device of transferring the technique of engraving, with its contrast between black and white, onto the screen pervades the screen version of The Overcoat made by FEKS (Factory of the Eccentric Ac- tor under the leadership of Grigory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg) in 1926. Another formalist, Iurii Tynianov, wrote the script for the film, cre- ating a montage out of The Overcoat, Nevskii Prospekt, and The Tale about the Quarrel between Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Nikiforovich. The excruciating search for an adequate visual means of representa- tion for Nikolai Gogol"s surreal word-and space-was left to Andrei Moskvin, then a beginning cameraman who later became well-known for working with Sergei Eizenshtein on the film Ivan the Terrible. Moskvin's bi- ographer lakov Butovskii notes, The Overcoat is built on the contrast between light and shadow. This de- vice reaches its ultimate form at the beginning: we see only silhouettes of the actors. In order to create his drama of the contrasting light, Moskvin preferred to work at night, savoring the contrast between the white snow and the black night of Petersburg. The idea of graphicality [grafichnost'] became the basis of the visual solution for this film.51 In the FEKS film, the city often appears to be a somber etching. In addi- tion to the silhouettes at the beginning of the film that recall the paper sil- houette portraits that were popular at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Moskvin provides at least two more instances when contrasts take center stage: during the robbery, when the tiny black figure of Akakii Akakievich seems lost on the glistening snow between the huge black shadows of the offenders, and when Bashmachkin runs to ask the police- man for help, the protagonist turns into a shadow himself-we see only Akakii's shadow jerking on the mercilessly lit fence. Moskvin was so involved in the play of contrasts that he even based the daylight scenes on them. An example of this is his introduction of the group of drummers in black into the scene of the corporal punishment of soldiers, which becomes a dull palette of gray-grayish snow, sunless af- ternoon, and the soldiers' gray underwear. The combination of gray and off-white in this scene creates the desired effect of the old etching com- posed around the concept of contrast. Reacting to the suggestion that FEKS' Overcoat was heavily influenced by German expressionist cinema, Kozintsev argues in his memoirs that the reality of Petersburg itself determined FEKS' visual methods: Each night during the cruel winter of 1920-1921, I had to walk back to my lodgings through the dark and deserted city, trudging through the piles of snow. The eagles on the dark street lamps were white with frost; 51. I. A.

It seemed to me that a strange, un- familiar path had led me into some enclave of the empire that was now dead and gone. Isolated by the darkness of the night and the bitter cold, I was alone in a baleful void, among the palaces and the monuments petrified by the frost. The compositions in The Overcoat- the snowbound square intersected by the shadows of the thieves, Akakii Akakievich call- ing for help in the desert of dark, the menacing monument amidst the snow-all this was inspired by reality itself. Life itself had been with- drawn, the landscape had become fantastic, and the palaces stood out like ghostly visions.52 In its contrast with present actuality, the present seemed so incredible as to be totally alien. The threads linking the past and the present were torn.53 Kozintsev's justification of his film methods seems to unite synthetically and yet paradoxically the two representational approaches to the demise of Petersburg that I have outlined above. On the one hand, his Petersburg is the city from the remote and even "exotic" past akin to Piranesi's Rome.54 This bygone Petersburg is permeated with figures from fiction: the ghosts of the petty clerks and the specters of the grand buildings. On the other hand, however, this sensation of detachment and phantas- magoria is undermined by the fact that Kozintsev the artist is, in reality, able to walk this surreal city of the past; in his memoirs, Kozintsev's per- sona serves as a substitute for Akakii Akakievich in the film. The vul- nerable and historically detached figure of the author identifies here with one of the inhabitants of the city whom artists like Shillingovskii depict as a tiny black figure at the foot of a dilapidated and picturesque architec- tural giant. Kozintsev writes simultaneously about his protagonist and about himself: "The tiny figure left Gogol"s book and entered the stage set of granite and bronze ... the stage set of the freezing and starving Petrograd.""55 Self-consciously elaborating on the uneasiness of his blurred percep- tion of Petersburg as a city of the past and the present, Kozintsev contin- ues: "It was difficult to imagine the past as reality: it seemed to be a delu- sion, and yet this delusion was happening and continuing! Life was, as it were, seen in an X-ray."56 The notion of life "seen in an X-ray," where the past peeps out of the present, forms the very kernel of the semantics of ruin. As Peter Fritzsche points out, "the representation of ruin articulates the process of destruction, conquest and renewal, and the fluidity of his- tory in general."57 In a way, Kozintsev's perception of the devastated Pet- rograd in 1921, where the city's past is revealed in its present moment and 52.

Significantly, Kozintsev's paradigm bears the sensibilities of the present, inserting them into the narrative of the past. I see this rhetorical gesture as an attempt to mediate between the two approaches to the task of representing the ruins of Petersburg that I ana- lyzed earlier-the camouflaging of the disaster into the distancing forms of the ambivalent and picturesque artificial ruins and the catastrophic ex- plosion of the authorial "I" superimposed on the fragments of cityscape. The problem of the aesthetization of the disaster that undergirds my study appears to be central for interpreting the traumatic history of Russian cul- ture in the twentieth century. By comparing different approaches to this problem in the works of Petrograd artists, my exploration reveals the pri- mary structural elements of this quest: a displaced authorial position, an endangered and ambiguous connection between the aesthetic tradition of the past and the crisis of the present, and the attempt to locate and redefine beauty in the zone of destruction and pain. The task of this study is to evaluate the strategies for the redefinition and recuperation of the troubled city-text, admiring the poignant aesthetic courage of its creators. After all, if we imagine the state of the Petersburg city-text after 1917 to be a fragmented jigsaw puzzle akin to Shklovskii's city line with black gaps, then the task of the artists of the city was akin to assembling this puzzle, replacing the lost picture with a new one that would be more adequate to the new status of the city, its author, and its text.</page></plain_text>
