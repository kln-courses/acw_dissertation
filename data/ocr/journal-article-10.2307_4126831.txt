<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Oracles of the Three Shrines: Windows on Japanese Religion. By Brian Bocking. Curzon, Richmond, Surrey, U.K., 2001. xvii, 142 pages. ?45.00. Reviewed by ALLAN G. GRAPARD University of California, Santa Barbara This is a very interesting study of a heretofore ignored but intriguing feature of Japanese religiosity: the tradition of representing on scrolls, first in cal- ligraphy only, and subsequently in iconic form, the names of the deities Amaterasu, Hachiman, and Kasuga, below each of which is listed an oracle containing a moral message. Known as sanja takusen, or "oracles of the three shrines," these scrolls (and, later, prints) have a long history the author traces with accuracy and interpretive skill, showing how they originated, at</page><page sequence="2">478 Journal of Japanese Studies 28:2 (2002) what levels of society they became popular over time, and indicating their multiple meanings as well as their institutional and economic moorings. It is, essentially, a multidisciplinary effort that succeeds in replacing its object in its sociocultural environment. The three shrines in question are directly connected to the imperial court: Ise is dedicated to Amaterasu-6-mikami, the ancestral kami of the im- perial line; its date of creation is unclear. The name of the shrine dedicated to Hachiman is not indicated, but the author argues convincingly that it is the Iwashimizu shrine-temple complex located south of Kyoto, created by Fujiwara no Yoshifusa and the monk Gy6ky6 between 859 and 863, upon the enthronement of the child emperor Seiwa (whose descendants are the Minamoto warlords who considered Hachiman as their tutelary deity). And Kasuga is the private shrine of the Fujiwara house, created in the second half of the eighth century. As has been pointed out in a number of studies, how- ever, prior to 1868 these shrines were associated with neighboring Buddhist temples, and their history is really that of the dialectic interactions that ob- tained between Buddhism and the so-called pre-Buddhist, native cults. Of course, each of these sites of cult has its own series of rituals and intricate history that are quite independent from the icons under consideration. Yet, they have had varied interactions over the centuries and do represent some kind of nexus of imperial rites, myths, and institutions. Indeed, it can be ad- vanced, as Bocking indicates, that the unity of which they are the symbol in the "oracles" studied here refers to a longstanding tradition of iconic triads one often sees in Buddhist as well as non-Buddhist ("ShintO") cults. The au- thor's project, then, is to unpack the changing meanings and aspects of these representations and to show how originally court-related symbols were pop- ularized to the extent they were. The study of Buddhist iconography is an old field and continues to be a vibrant area of inquiries. By comparison, the study of non-Buddhist ico- nography in Japan is relatively recent and has been marred, from its incep- tion, by the radical religious breaks of the Meiji period. The term "ShintO arts," used by Kageyama Haruki and others after him, is rather misleading, since the majority of the artifacts in question are in fact Shint6-Buddhist, so much so that if one were to look for only non-Buddhist artifacts, one would come up with a very short list indeed. Buddhism has long dominated the in- tellectual world of Japan, just as it has dominated the shrines with which its temples were associated, and just as it has dominated iconographic rendi- tions: there is simply no such thing as a "ShintO" iconographic tradition that could be studied independently from Buddhism. Yet, Bocking writes that "all the examples of the sanja takusen gathered in this book are 'Shinto' in character, but this is not a statement overburdened with meaning" (p. 2), and here I would suggest that a more precise analysis of the Hachiman cult in</page><page sequence="3">Review Section 479 particular might force him to reconsider this phrasing. Hachiman is the old- est combinatory cult of Japan; it surfaced slowly in Usa in Kyushu in the eighth century under a number of regional influences that were disrupted by the emerging force of the Yamato "center" at the time, and the identity of Hachiman as the conformation of "Emperor Ojin" does not appear in docu- ments prior to 815, at the very same time that Hachiman is referred to as a "great bodhisattva."I For the majority of his history Hachiman has not been treated as a kami, but as a Buddhist entity, and this is true of his cult's ico- nography as well, because anthropomorphic representations of Japanese di- vine entities originated in a Buddhist context. Bocking refers to the bodhisattva character of Hachiman and to schol- arship on the history of its iconography; and yet something subtle is miss- ing. Hachiman is the oldest and most important oracular cult of Japan and here deserves further analysis, since the book is on the topic of oracles. A presentation of the "Compendium of Oracles of Hachiman at Usa" (Hachi- man Usaga gotakusen-sha), for example, would have given more substance to the discussion. This collection of oracles and interpretations was com- piled by the shasi (shrine-monk) Jin'un (1213-1314) between the years 1290 and 1313. Typical of religious figures at the time, Jin'un was born in the Oga sacerdotal house of Usa, but he went on to become the leading scholarly monk of that city's shrine-temple complex (Usa-gti and the Mirokuji temple), and thus provides us with one of the best examples of the relations between temples and shrines, and of how oracles were conceived at the time. Indeed, it should suffice to quote a single passage of this com- pendium to make the point: [Hachiman] made a vow to protect the imperial line and show compassion for the people; he swore to grant peace to this court and to pacify foreign lands. What do the words "protect the imperial line and show compassion for the people" mean? Only this: to progressively reveal [the nature of the Buddha's] awakening. What do the words "grant peace to this court and pacify foreign lands" mean? Only this: to dispel errors one by one. Were it not so, what else could it be? A honji [a Buddha or bodhisattva as the orig- inal form of a kami] is obscure and profound and manifests itself this or that way, but a Buddha is just that: a Buddha. The body of essence [of the Bud- dha] is all-pervasive and manifests itself as all phenomena, but a kami spirit is just that: a spirit. [Therefore] one [must] surrender to the Buddha and to the kami, and, choosing a single path, pray for the present and the future. Walking on the ground of mystic realization, one expresses gratitude.... On the Buddhist level, preaching takes the form called "sfitra"; on the 1. I review all available scholarship concerning this issue and discuss the Hachiman orac- ular cult in my Mountain Mandalas: Mountain Religion in Japan (Stanford: Stanford Univer- sity Press, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="4">480 Journal of Japanese Studies 28:2 (2002) Shinto level, it receives the name "oracle."2 A Buddha shows his form while teaching, but a kami remains without formal aspect while speaking.3 That is, Jin'un proposed that while Buddhism was based on its canon of scriptures, Shint6 (as a manifestation of Buddhism) was based on oracular pronouncements. These two were thoroughly connected in the religious par- adigm that was dominant prior to the early modern (Edo) period; they were not equivalent, however, because oracles could be deemed fraudulent, in which case they were checked through the form of divination called plastro- mancy (a specialty of the Urabe sacerdotal house, an offshoot of which was the Yoshida sacerdotal house, deeply connected to the spread of these three shrines' oracles). In the case of the Kasuga cult too, oracles played an important role dur- ing the medieval period, though not as central as in the Hachiman cult. The most famous such oracle is that telling Myo-e shonin that the Kasuga cult is symbolized by the deer, which means that the Kasuga shrine's grounds re- ally are the Deer Park (of India) where the Buddha gave his first sermon- and that therefore My6-e should abandon his plan to travel to India. There too, it is impossible to dissociate the Buddhist context from the "ShintO" context. Finally, the case of Ise is slightly more complex, but-as Bocking notes properly-Buddhism played an important part in pilgrimages to Ise and in that site's "popular" cult. There again one would have wished a more substantial discussion, which could begin with the analysis of the Ise "pil- grimage mandalas" (sankei mandara) of the Muromachi period. These are discussed in detail by Nishiyama Masaru, for example, who shows the great importance of the Kong6shoji of Mount Asama during the medieval period and also indicates the nonnegligible role of Buddhist esoteric rituals and ter- minology, and of Shugend6 as well, in the formation of Ise pilgrimages and understandings prior to the early modern period. Bocking, however, focuses his discussion solely on the early modern period and thereby misses a few foundational and significant elements of the topic.4 The above is not meant to detract from the author's work, but to suggest there is ample evidence available to avoid falling into the trap of misplaced categories. One possible reason for the need to conduct his discussion the way Bocking does may be the role played by Yoshida Shinto in the dissem- ination of the "Oracles of the Three Shrines." Indeed, Yoshida Kanetomo (1435-1511) reversed the vertical power relation between the Buddhas and 2. The term used is takusen, but Jin'un sometimes used the more restrictive term Shinto no kybmei. 3.

The net result of his views, though, was that the meaning of the term Shinto suddenly became a very loaded question-which neo-Confucian and Nativist Studies thinkers picked up on. And here Bocking is on fairly sure footing as he guides the reader through the various intellectual and religious transformations of the early modern period (Edo), and he does a great job of bringing to light the ensuing transformations of these three shrine icons and oracles, all the way to the Meiji period and to the contemporary situation. This, in my opinion, is the best part of the book, and the argument is solidly buttressed by refer- ences to the many photographic representations of the scrolls and prints that accompany the discussion. Here indeed one gets the sense that these partic- ular "icons" had a remarkable history; that they were deeply connected to various classes of society; that they were associated with pilgrimage, oral teachings, and socioeconomic ethics; and that in the Meiji period they were subverted by the state, as a result of which they seem to have lost their erstwhile fostering of creativity, and eventually became a mere fossilized convention. This book should be widely used in undergraduate classes, because it so elegantly shows how apparently simple icons could be used by so many different layers of society in all kinds of religious contexts ranging from "ShintO" to esoteric Buddhism, Zen, folk religion (if this term is appropri- ate at all), lay associations, and even in the context of the state. Bocking's demonstration should cause all students to ponder the nature of the cate- gories often used in the study of Japanese religions and to embrace the study of the arts as an essential part of religious and social history. I was particu- larly gratified to see a mention of the gender changes Amaterasu underwent through time; indeed, Amaterasu representations seem to have followed the spirit of historical eras when it was claimed this deity was a female, or a male, or a female again, or a male again. In the modern period, for instance, the eminent historian of Japanese women, Takamure Itsue, argued that Amaterasu was indeed a female, only to see how, subsequently, the mili- taristic ideology transformed Amaterasu into a male, solar, and martial en- tity. These changes were not of inconsequential meaning and therefore de- serve a more sustained historical analysis than is provided in this book. In any case, this work finds a good place among others of the same kind, such as the studies of the late Miyata Noboru on the Edo period's ha- yarigami, the late Bernard Frank's accumulation of amulets and detailed studies of Japanese iconography, and more recently, to name only a few, the fascinating studies of Yamamoto Hiroko, Yoneyama Toshinao, Bernard Faure, and Robert Duquenne.</page></plain_text>
