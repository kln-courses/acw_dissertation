<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brian Winston A Whole Technology of Dyeing: A Note on Ideology and the Apparatus of the Chromatic Moving Image The aesthetic has lost its innocence. Today in critical discourse it is seen, often as not, as nothing but a willing tool of "the ideology of the dominant class": The aesthetic is for a number of reasons a peculiarly effective ideological medium: it is graphic, immediate and economical, working at instinctual and emotional depths yet playing too on the very surfaces of perception, entwining itself with the stuff of spontaneous experience and the roots of language and gesture. Precisely on this account, it is able to naturalise itself, to proffer itself as ideologically innocent.1 As Roland Barthes has pointed out: "Bourgeois ideology is of the scientific or intuitive kind, it records facts or perceives values, but refuses explanations; the order of the world can be seen as sufficient or ineffable but it is never seen as significant."2 What follows is by way of a case study, taken from the realm of the moving image, illustrative of the ways in which ideologically complicit cultural production takes place. No means of representation is as "innocent," as "scientific," as the photograph. Yet "every time we look at a photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other sights."3 Moreover, there are factors that go beyond the predelictions of the person handling the photographic apparatus, to the ideologically charged nature of the apparatus itself. Photo graphs, cinema, and television do not merely express in texts the 105</page><page sequence="2">io6 Brian Winston ideology of the culture that produces them, with the possibility that other ideologies could equally easily be signified in different texts; rather, the technologies are themselves an ideological expression of the culture. It is one such expression?color film that more readily photographs Caucasians than other human types?that is our con cern in this piece. At the end of the documentary El Pueblo Vencer?,4 in a mirror image of the opening scene of the film, a young Salvadoran gun toting guerilla in full fatigues encounters an elderly peasant woman, covered basket on head, in a clearing. The woman places her burden on the ground, pulls back the cover and reveals an Arriflex BL 16mm professional film camera for which the guerilla triumphantly ex changes his gun. If the pen was once deemed mightier than the sword, then today the camera can no doubt be thought mightier than the machine gun. But for this proposition to hold up, a preconditional further point must be admitted, viz, that the camera, a product of West German high technology costing some $15,000, is a device that serves, despite its provenance, any communications purpose. Implicit is the idea that, in the context of the politics of El Salvador or in any other situation, the camera is in some sense neutral?just as the gun is neutral. That the cinema is a child of science and exhibits the supposed objectivity and accuracy of its parent is well known. Cinematogra phy, like photography (and like the camera obscura), was initially introduced to the public as a tool of science, and those who worked the new apparatus in each case were non tanquam pictor, sed tanquam mathematicus.5 It is worth noting that these supposed objective qualities are seductive enough to convince many?even Diego de la Texera, director of El Pueblo Vencer?, who in different circumstances would be more on the qui vive as to the ideological forces with which they are dealing. It is as if de la Texera and other radical film and video makers have not understood the ideologically imposed limitations of the apparatus. The apparatus of film and television is indeed so limited. It is, as A.D. Coleman points out, a product of "the lens culture" finally inaugurated by Cardano, Maurolycus, and Digges in the early 15 50s,6 and the replication of Northern European "distant point construction" perspective is its primary design objective.7 The pho</page><page sequence="3">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 107 tographi? image accommodates the previously established codes of representation just as the social circumstances in which these new images are consumed conform to preexisting and culturally specific patterns. The apparatus is not neutral, and altering its purpose requires considerable deformation of its inherent (i.e., designed-in) capacities and capabilities. Understanding of the ideological implications of the institution of the cinema, including its apparatus, began in earnest in the aftermath of the evenments of 1968 and has been conducted in the pages of the French film journals with recent useful contributions from American and British film historians and theoreticians on specific issues. The agenda of this debate has broadened from (comparatively) simple considerations of the ideological intentions or implications of this or that film text, to include psychologically inflected discussions of the unavoidable ideological effects of viewing films and, to a lesser degree, television,8 as well as accounts and explanations of the development and implications of the entire technical apparatus and economic structure of the film and television industries.9 The discus sion that follows is part of this latter project. II We so often forget, for example, that when a color film is seen projected, the color is not in the Bazanian sense a direct... registration of color in the natural world ... there is, in fact, no direct... link between the color of the natural world and the cplor of the projected color film?a whole technology of dyeing has intervened.10(jtdXics added) The makers of El Pueblo Vincera, a color film, must have been aware of the limitations placed upon them by the use of color when filming black people. All professionals fully understand that such films, despite continuous improvements in performance, do not render black skin tones as easily as they do white; and that, when filming blacks, it is often necessary to augment lighting, by bouncing reflected light back into the face from a low angle, for instance, so as not to lose details. Were these stocks to offer "a direct... registration of color in the natural world," we could simply attribute the difficulties of representing blacks on film to a natural racial disadvantage? somewhat like sickle-cell anaemia. But color film does not directly register the world; "a whole technology of dyeing intervenes."</page><page sequence="4">io8 Brian Winston As the comedian Godfrey Cambridge once hyperbolized?but only slightly?blacks look green on American (NTSC; National Television Standards Committee) television, no knob-twiddling changes their color (unless one makes the white people orange), and he for one was not surprised. It is the history and ideological implications of this technology, a white technology that best reproduces Caucasian skin tones, that I wish to explore. At one level it is "inevitable" that the bias of color film should be the way it is. After all, according to Kodak, more than eight billion color negative exposures were made in the U.S. alone in 198z, and the vast majority of them were by and of whites.11 But the rhetoric surrounding color film, as much in the technical and scholarly literature as in advertising and other popular accounts, implicitly denies any such partiality in favor of a stress on naturalness, realism, and verisimilitude?mathematics, as it were, rather than painting. Even aware scholars slip easily into this language. Edward Branigan, for instance, in an otherwise most illuminating account of how film historians have represented the development of color cinematogra phy, describes both additive and subtractive photographic methods as "natural color processes": It is enough to note, without exploring details, that natural color processes are usually divided into two types?additive color systems (e.g., Kinemacolor, early Technicolor, and modern television) and subtractive color systems (e.g., Technicolor, Eastman Color, and Kodachrome).... We have considered the invention of color with respect to the photograph {natural color), but a second line of development lies closer to painting. Hand-painted daguerreotypes appeared around 1839 and hand-painted films appeared with the very first films in 1894... .12(italics added) A survey of color processes written for a professional journal by an official of Eastman Kodak highlights the supposed naturalness of the company's subtractive systems in the language of impeccable scien tific description: All of the [additive] systems discussed ... have resulted in a final picture being put on the screen in color by superimposing or adding the lights of two or three primary colors. In nature, however, colors of objects are viewed by subtraction; they absorb or subtract certain component parts of the visible spectrum of white light and reflect the remainder, which the eye sees as color.13</page><page sequence="5">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 109 (This analogy between human vision and the way Eastman Kodak's color films "view" nature is obviously anthropomorphic and tenden tious.) Thus, the cultural specificity of color film is systematically denied, and instead it is suggested that the stocks, true to their scientific heritage, reflect and re-present the natural world. This places the development of color squarely within that received view, theoretically legitimated by Andr? Bazin, which holds that the entire technological development of cinema progressively seeks to possess the world iconically. And as Natalie Kalmus, wife 8f the "inventor" of Technicolor, Herbert Kalmus, expressed it half a century ago when addressing a meeting of technicians that was held under the rubric "Color Consciousness": From a technical standpoint, motion pictures have been steadily tending toward more complete realism. In the early days, pictures were a mere mechanical process of imprinting light upon film and projecting that result upon a screen. Then came the perfection of detail?more accurate sets and costumes?more perfect photography. The advent of sound brought in creased realism through the auditory senses. The last step, color, with the addition of the chromatic sensations, completed the process. Now motion pictures are able to duplicate faithfully all the auditory and visual sensations. This enhanced realism enables us to portray life and nature as it really is, and in this respect we have made definite strides forward.14 Within this claim of general faithful duplication, "flesh" always comes to mean Caucasian skin tones.15 Only in the mid-fifties does a degree of what might be called sophistication begin to creep into the professional discourse: "Flesh-color, even of the so-called 'white' races, varies from light pink or almost white to various shades of tan and brown according to the type of skin and the amount of sunburn_"16 However, elsewhere in the standard work just quoted, "flesh" ranks between "yellow" or "sand" or proximate to "peach" and "white."17 The cultural assumptions of those concerned with the development and applications of color film are those of the society at large. Natalie Kalmus, for instance, had these unsurprising things to say about "black" and "white": Black is no color, but the absorption of all color. It has a distinctly negative and destructive aspect. Black instinctively recalls night, fear, darkness, crime. It suggests funerals, mourning. It is impenetrable, comfortless,</page><page sequence="6">no Brian Winston secretive. It flies at the masthead of the pirate's ship. Our language is replete with references to this frightful power of black?black art, black despair, blackguard, blackmail, black hand, the black hole of Calcutta, black death (the devastating plague of medieval Europe), black list, black-hearted, etc. -White represents purity, cleanliness, peace and marriage. Its introduc tion into a color sublimates that color. For example, the red of love becomes more refined and idealistic as white transforms the red to pink. White uplifts and ennobles, while black lowers and renders more base and evil any color.18 It is no sin that Kalmus and her peers were less sophisticated than, say, Wittgenstein (or Eisenstein) about color. The sin is that they claimed, both in practice and theory, to be doing what came naturally, rather than recognizing the cultural influences that led them, through complex optics and chemistry, to a most highly mediated analogue of the natural world of color. Ill There are two methods currently available for capturing color iconically on a photographic plate. In one?microdispersion, devel oped by F.W. Lanchester in 1895?a coarse grating, with some three hundred slits to the inch, is interposed within the body of the camera between the taking lens and the film. The grating breaks up the light, which is then collected by a second field lens and passed through a narrow angled prism. Lenses on either side of the prism, the third and fourth needed for the system, focus the image of the slits (turned by the prism into spectra) onto the photographic plate. By these means, the image is broken down into its constituent color elements? dominant wavelength, chroma, luminance, and value?that are then recorded on the plate. After development, the plate can be viewed by reversing the light path through the system so that the taking lens becomes a projection lens, and all of the original chromaticities and intensities are recreated.19 A second direct method was developed in 1891 by Gabriel Lippmann, professor of physics at the Sorbonne from 1878 and a Nobel laureate in 1908. It was a Lippmann "photochrome" made in the summer of 1893 by the Lumi?re brothers that ranks as the first color portrait. Unlike the microdispersion method, the Lippmann system does not require a special camera, only a modified plate</page><page sequence="7">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 111 holder. It depends on an emulsion of extremely fine grain, in which the individual photosensitive granules are physically shorter than the color wavelengths that are to be recorded. The plate is placed in the camera with the emulsion side away from the lens. After exposing the plate, Lippmann poured a film of pure mercury against the emulsion, thus mirroring it. The light-waves of the image are reflected in the mercury back against the incoming waves and the interference pattern thereby caused is recorded on the plate. This pattern of stationary waves in the emulsion can then be developed and contains all the information of the chromaticities and intensities of the original colors. The image can be reproduced by using reflected light passed through the plate.20 "Photochromes" are obsolete and have never enjoyed any degree of popularity. The fine grain required to record accurately all the color data needs emulsions that are so slow as apparently to require several minutes of exposure even in sunlight, and the images can be viewed only by carefully positioning the eye at a precise angle? otherwise no color can be seen at all. Similar difficulties attach to the microdispersion method. The special camera is bulky, and the additional optics as well as the fine grain necessitate strong illumina tion and long exposures. However real or otherwise these disadvan tages,21 the direct systems do seem to require considerable light and certainly yield no prints. There was not enough demand for the "scientific" direct color image to overcome these difficulties and ensure a diffusion of the techniques. For all that "photochromes" record photographically the physical parameters of the original spectral phenomena, the human eye/brain mechanism does not require such a degree of fidelity since it normally simplifies the color information it processes. Artificial renditions of color, it turns out, need not represent reality as faithfully as direct methods do. Filters and dyes are psychologically effective, although the abandoned iconic processes remain the standard against which the limitations of the more-than-a-hundred filter- and dye based systems must be measured. It was known from 1722 that when three mezzotinted copper plates, one blue, one red, and one yellow, are superimposed, they produce a full-color plate. The laborious handwork on the stone this system required was superceded by lithography, another three-color process introduced commercially in 1812. In 18 61, the great English</page><page sequence="8">112 Brian Winston physicist Clerk Maxwell, while discoursing on the nature of human color perception, offered a suggestion as to how it might be demon strated: Let it be required to ascertain the colors of a landscape by means of impressions taken on a preparation equally sensitive to rays of every color. Let a plate of red glass be placed before the camera, and an impression taken. The positive of this will be transparent wherever the red light has been abundant in the landscape, and opaque where it has been wanting. Let it now be put in a magic lantern with the red glass, and a red picture will be thrown on the screen. Let this operation be repeated with a green and a violet glass, and by means of three magic lanterns let the three images be superimposed on the screen. The color on any point on the screen will depend on that of the corresponding point of the landscape, and by properly adjusting the intensities of the lights, etc., a complete copy of the landscape, as far as visible color is concerned, will be thrown on the screen.22 Maxwell's three-color hypothesis is the basis for all current color reproductive methods, photographic and electronic, and at first it might seem as if it agrees with the physiology of the human eye.23 As far as can be determined, the cones of the retina, those photore ceptors sensitive to color, are of three types: the p (responsive to red-orange-yellow), the 7 (responsive to orange-yellow-green blue/green), and the ? (responsive to blue/green-blue-violet). If Max well's filters, or any dyes used in a photographic process, only triggered one of these cone-types as appropriate, then the pattern of stimulation caused by viewing the reproduction would agree exactly with the original stimulus?as occurs in Professor Lippmann's im ages, for instance. Unfortunately, no filter can be found that will activate only the 7-cones. Wherever green appears, there will be an excess of ? and p-cone stimulus that will render greens paler and, although scarcely noticeable in the reds and blues, will also cause whites to acquire a magenta tinge. Increasing the intensity of the red and blue lights or dyes restores the white but at the cost of distortion in the relative chromaticities and intensities?which, as it happens, is psychologically (or, perhaps better, ideologically) less offensive than off-white. And here is opened a whole can of colored worms, especially close (chromatically speaking) to Caucasian skin tones. This is not the place in which to outline the range of choices facing those chemists and physicists whose job it is to produce color sensitive photographic and electronic materials. Suffice it only to</page><page sequence="9">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 113 point out that with trichromatic systems (contemporary color sys tems, that is) the opportunities for choice and the need for decisions are boundless; this is why one color film or color television system is easily distinguished from another, and none, it can fairly be claimed, is perfectly iconic. IV From the beginning, motion picture films were hand-colored and were very often, if not most of the time, printed on tinted stocks. With the introduction of sound, tinting at the developing stage was abandoned because the process interfered with the optical sound track. Kodak responded by introducing a range of seventeen tinted Sonochrome positive stocks that did not affect the audio track. Kinemacolor, the earliest movie system to exploit the Maxwell additive approach, was in commercial operation by 1909. It was a two-color sequential process in which camera (and projector) alter nately exposed frames through revolving filter disks, at an increased rate of 32 per second. The disks contained two filters, one cyan/blue, the other red/orange.24 The Dowager Empress of Russia, after watching at Buckingham Palace the Kinemacolor film of George V's Delhi Durbar, pronounced that it "gives one the impression of having seen it all in reality."25 Other subsequent additive systems rang the changes on the basic method of superimposing discretely tinted images. These included squeezing the images onto one 35 mm frame or, in a significant development, splitting the image so that it fell through a green or red filter onto two separate film strips. Apart from registration diffi culties, the comparative darkness of the blue filter translated into a brightness flicker in the sequential variants of this approach, and there was always a tendency, whatever system was used, towards color fringing?i.e., chromaticities did not agree exactly with the outlines of objects, but bled. Eventually, these additive processes would encompass three color filters rather than two, as many as four filtered images per frame, and, always, extremely complex cameras and projectors. Yet although the last variant was proposed as late as 1950, additive color reproduction never took hold in the cinema. Kalmus, of Technicolor, in describing what drove him from additive to subtractive processes, graphically illustrates why:</page><page sequence="10">114 Brian Winston During one terrible night in Buffalo, I decided that such special attachments on the projector required an operator who was a cross between a college professor and an acrobat, a phrase which I have since heard repeated many times. Technicolor then and there abandoned additive processes and special attachments on the projector.24 In 1922, after six years of effort, Kalmus thus quit the search for additive solutions. Subtractive systems, the principles of which had been outlined by du Hauron and, independently, by Cros in 1869, could in theory produce a colored film that would simply be threaded through a standard projector. Subtractive processes also rely on a series of separate trichromatically filtered black-and-white images, but instead of remaining discrete, each image is dyed and then superimposed?as in lithography?upon the others to create the full-color picture. The major problem lay in the difficulty of dyeing the negatives. "Imbibing"?or relief image?was the earliest system, patented in 1874, for achieving this.27 The gelatin of a negative swells up in proportion to the intensity of the exposure (or becomes thinner where more exposed), allowing a developing procedure in which a colored dye solution adheres to those parts thus distinguished. The exposed gelatin imbibes the liquid dye. Sequential imbibings create a full trichromatic subtractive image on the one gelatine base. This dye-image is easily copied so that many prints can be run off. The Technicolor subtractive process used two films (one sensitive to the red-yellow range, another to the green-blue) cemented back to back. In a 1928 refinement, Kalmus managed to get them on the same celluloid base?a "bipack"?using the imbibing method. By 1932, the Technicolor process involved not just stock and developing techniques, but also a special beam-splitter camera, of the sort first introduced to aid an additive process in 1918, which exposed a blue/red bipack film and, simultaneously, a separate green negative. This produced a three-color master. The system, in all its various forms, privileged the laboratory, because that was where the color image?for all that it was indexi cally (i.e., photographically) bound to represent colors in the real world?was, in effect, created. Although neither the special camera nor the superiority of Technicolor's imbibing technique were of Kalmus's devising, they enabled him to demand and obtain consid erable control over the films shot with this process. He had perfected</page><page sequence="11">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 115 the most effective exploitation of known methods, and exceptional craft in the laboratory, as much as any other factor, was the basis of Technicolor's hegemony over cinema color. The close control exer cised by Kalmus's "color consultants"?often over the resistance of studio technicians who were under no illusions about Technicolor's "naturalness"?limited the circumstances in which the film was exposed. The result was that the stock established its own reference system consistent, not with nature, but only with itself, as in one of Tolkien's fairy-tale worlds. By the late forties, Technicolor's hegemony also entailed a range of patent and antitrust problems,28 but since 1953 the camera and the special negative stocks had been abandoned. Technicolor is now essentially only a multinational chain of laboratories that bring their special skills to Eastman Kodak materials The original Kodachrome process was introduced in 1913 and in 1916 was adapted for movies by use of a beam-splitter camera. In 1928, under license from its French developers, Kodak began to manufacture a film it named Kodacolor?a lenticular 16mm stock. Twenty years before, Gabriel Lippmann had envisioned a film stock that had, in effect, a myriad of tiny lenses embedded in the emul sion?a monochrome extension, in some sense, of his previous direct system?that would allow for normal viewing. The following year, 1909, Rudolph Berthon thought to place a three-color filter before such a film, and in 1923 a successful demonstration of a color lenticular process was given in Paris. The method produced prints of great delicacy, but attempts by Kodak, Paramount, and the French to make a 35mm lenticular stock were fruitless; anyway, by that time, the mid-thirties, Kodak was ready with a new Kodachrome.29 The chemistry enabling subtraction to take place on a single negative was understood in the same year Berthon began developing the lenticular stock. Rudolf Fischer and his assistant Johann Siegrist noticed that paraphenylendiamine, a photographic developer, pro duced oxidations as it worked on the silver halides of the film. It "coupled" with the emulsion to form a color, in effect making an insoluble dye.30 Fischer patented the idea of "color-formers" or "dye-couplers" in 1912 and publicized a growing list of compound substances in a series of patents and reports in the British, French, German, and American technical press before the First World War.31 Other workers in the early twenties added to the number of known</page><page sequence="12">116 Brian Winston couplers, but it was two young American amateur chemists (and professional musicians) who were to create the first practical appli cation of Fischer's breakthrough. In 1924, Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky, Jr., patented a reversal film stock where two emulsions were placed on a single base, the lower one faster and sensitized to red, the upper one slower and sensitized to green-blue/green.32 Clearly, the combination of dye couplers and multilayer variable speed emulsion had the potential of producing, on one base, an integral full-color image with the trichromatic filters and all the necessary dyes "built in," as it were. By 1930, Mannes and Godowsky, working privately, still remained a step ahead of the industrial laboratories. At this point, Kodak had the good sense to hire them, and they moved out of various hotel rooms and the bathrooms of their parents' New York apartments to Rochester. By 1933, they had perfected a bipack reversal system for 16mm use; then on April 15th, 1935, Kodak offered a new Kodachrome amateur movie stock, the "tripac" implied by Cros's vision nearly seventy years earlier. For the first time, an easy-to-use color stock was available that required no special apparatus. A year later, a 35 mm version for reversal transparencies was introduced. Kodak designed the films so that the couplers were added, not to the emulsion, but during the development process. This created a situation as privileged as the one into which Kalmus had steered Technicolor; anybody could expose Kodachrome, but only Kodak could develop it. It is not entirely inappropriate that Kodachrome's "inventors" were known in the Kodak Research Laboratory as "God and Man." They had not only broken through into a new world of color, but in so doing they had created a virtual processing monopoly. The German company Agfa, close on Kodak's heels, produced a comparable stock at the same time with the couplers built into the film so that it could be developed anywhere. Because these solutions all produced approximations and involved trade-offs in color responsiveness, grain, and overall sensitivity, that was not the end of the matter. The tripack subtractive film has undergone immense development since Mannes and Godowski's day. Agfa introduced a color-negative system just before the Second World War. Kodak marketed Ektachrome, a tripack with built-in couplers that could be developed at home. Edwin Land adapted his</page><page sequence="13">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 117 instant monochrome system to Polacolor in 1962. In general, all these film stocks gained steadily over the years in both sensitivity (with no concomitant increase in grain) and overall responsiveness. After the war, the differences between Agfacolor and the American color films assumed an overt ideological significance when the Russians adopted, or rather captured, the former. Agfacolor became a "socialist" stock: it had paler colors, muted edges, and increased sensitivity to pastels. This was in contrast to Technicolor, which was "purer than reality, needing strong artificial light, aggressive, almost whorish." These are the terms, Dudley Andrew suggests, in which the French perceived the ideological differences in this color "cold war" of the late forties.33 After the Second World War, the French, lacking a domestic subtractive system, were faced with choosing between domestic-additive (and therefore obsolete) methods, including a revived lenticular stock, or importing foreign technology. The do mestic systems failed, and the French chose Agfacolor?but disguised in a politically acceptable form because obtained from Agfa's pre-war Belgian partners, Gaevert. Technicolor lost out in France, not just because of French ambivalence ("a desire for, and a loathing of, American technology," in Andrew's phrase) but more important, because with only three laboratories?in Hollywood, New Jersey, and London?it simply could not handle any more business. By 1948, it demanded nine months lead-time on principle photography, and printing schedules were being planned three years in advance. V We have presented the history of the development of ?mstocks as the locus of choice and decision, but the color image depends, as Technicolor's insistance on control of the filmic event reveals, on more than just the stock. As we have indicated, the image can be altered (within the parameters of the film) during processing, al though with color these options are much reduced. There are other major factors involved. Technicolor's move onto the studio floor was motivated as much by the desire to maintain absolute control over lighting as to prohibit outsiders from loading the cameras. (This was done ostensibly to protect the patent, but since that was a matter of public record, other factors must also have been at work.) Control of lighting was crucial, and when coupled with the existing power of the</page><page sequence="14">118 Brian Winston laboratory, ensured the consistency of Technicolor's performance, especially as sets, costume, and makeup could also be bent to highlight the process' most responsive aspects. Natural and manmade "white" unfiltered lights are actually col ored. They range from, say, the blue of a northern sky, through sunlight, to projection bulbs, and the comparative red of ordinary incandescent household lamps. (As conventionally measured in de grees Kelvin, these examples run from 7500 for the northern sky to 2800 for the household lamp.) With monochrome film, the color of the illumination is significant, but not critical. With color film, of course, it assumes a far greater moment. After the First World War, film lighting had settled its own artificial code, mixing, in the interests of maintaining a largely realist convention, a number of theatrical systems: basic flat lighting, lighting for effects, and spotlighting. Peter Baxter persuasively argues that as electricity was introduced into the studios in the years before the war, there was a desire to emulate the most advanced stage techniques: "the cinema was moving in the same direction as commercial American theatre, and a few paces behind it."34 The combination of techniques resulted in the "three-point" (i.e., keylight, fill-light, and backlight) overhead system?with almost no floor-level sources except for special effects?that is still in use today. For Baxter, this application of the electric light expresses the domi nant ideological assumptions of the studios in creating a style that operates by "revelation and expression."35 Monochrome stocks became ever more sensitive until, in the late thirties, general lighting levels could be reduced by 70 percent. The studios were now so dim, comparatively speaking, that cinematog raphers began to use photoelectric light meters to ensure proper exposure, something the mysterium of the craft did not previously allow.36 A sequence of responses, ostensibly occasioned by changes in the technology (sound as well as color), can be traced in lighting, set and costume design, and makeup. These changes are more complex than a simple technological progression suggests, since they actually reflect the forces at work within the organization of the industry, the social positioning of Hollywood, as well as the underlying thrust towards an ever-more-transparent mode of representation. As a prophylactic against widespread filmmaking in the society, the combined effect of all these complications could not be bettered.</page><page sequence="15">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 119 Movie production became, like newspaper production a hundred years earlier, more and more capital-intensive and less and less accessible. This is the trajectory, a common one in media technology since it can be seen not only in newspaper history, that the cinema traces. Once established behind a "high-tech" bastion, cheaper monopack color systems were introduced without fear that the other elements of the process would be easily duplicated either by those seeking entry to the industry or even by rank outsiders. Similarly, the 16mm format was improved and professionalized for television use, that is, within a highly capital-intensive environment. The public was left for nearly forty years with 8mm, a film too grainy for large-scale exhibition. The ideological underpinnings of these technological developments are, comparatively speaking, clearer than the cinema's supposed drive towards "realism." Color was more than unrealistic, in the sense of being a highly manufactured approximation of the real world, and it was, as Ed Buscombe points out,37 not used in those sorts of movies that at first sight might have been thought to benefit most from additional "realism"?social dramas in the genres of war and crime films (insofar as these were "realistic") or newsreels and documentaries. (It should not be objected that the color stocks were too slow for non-fiction since much of it was shot outdoors. Color newsreels were certainly possible and could have appeared much earlier than they did.) Instead, the first trichromatic Technicolor film was Disney's Oscar-winning cartoon Flowers and Trees. Douglas Fairbanks, star of the bichromatic Technicolor feature The Pirate, complained that color could distract the eye, confuse the action, and, presumably worst of all, "take attention from acting and facial expression."38 It was also more expensive, a further significant factor during the Depression. Buscombe argues that color came to denote luxury, spectacle, or fantasy, and a celebration of its own technological mastery. Thus, Kansas is black and white; Oz is technicolored. So much did color come to signify a lack of serious intent that a Pathe producer was able to announce in 1947: "The French don't go in for musicals or color."39 A confusion therefore exists about the signification of color in the Hollywood film, a confusion that simultaneously deems color real and fantastic; there is also a certain cognitive dissonance in the professional discourse. Even Natalie Kalmus realized that despite</page><page sequence="16">i2o Brian Winston motion pictures' faithful duplication of "all the auditory and visual sensations," there is a distinction between "natural colors and lights" and "man-made colors and artificial lights."40 It is a distinction she and her fellow workers devoted their lives to ignoring. VI In all this it should not be forgotten that "perhaps the most important single factor in dramatic cinematography is the relation between the color sensitivity of an emulsion and the reproduction of pleasing flesh tones."41 The failure to find a direct color system requires not only chemical manipulation; it allows manipulation to accommodate the cultural prejudices of the users?to make, by careful chemistry, already pleasing (Caucasian) flesh tones more pleasing than they are in nature. Determining which prejudices might be at work in the culture became an agenda item for the research laboratory: Series of color prints have been made from well-exposed color separation negatives of several typical scenes. The prints of each of these differ in tone reproduction, balance and in other ways subject to controlled variation. These series have been presented to numerous judges, and their judgments have been compared with results of measurements of various colors in the prints. Central to this positivist social science enterprise undertaken by Kodak researchers in the early fifties was a series of prints of a portrait of "a young lady" which exhibited variations of balance from too red or yellow to too blue, and from too green to too pink. These prints were submitted to a number of judges who were asked to accept or reject each on the basis of color alone. ... Optimum reproduction of skin color is not "exact" reproduction ... "exact reproduction" is rejected almost unanimously as "beefy." On the other hand, when the print of highest acceptance is masked and compared with the original subject, it seems quite pale. ... The discrepancy between "exact" reproduction and preferred reproduc tion is partly due to distortions inherent in the process, such that a certain discrepancy of a particular color is necessary to permit the best over-all reproduction of all colors in the picture. Similar results have been obtained with other colors. The directions and amounts of difference between exact reproduction and optimum reproduc tion are different for every color tested.42</page><page sequence="17">A Whole Technology of Dyeing 121 Kodak, faced with the physical inevitability of distortion, here establishes the potential superiority of its products to the real world. The subject of the photograph can be made to have skin tones more pleasing than she has in reality. Exact reproduction, a supposed goal of the photographic and cinematographic project, takes second place to inexact, culturally determined, "optimum" reproduction. Cauca sian skin tones are not to be rendered as they are, but rather as they are preferred?a whiter shade of white. The results of such social investigations as well as the growing understanding of the physics of color, the physiology of perception, and the chemistry of dyes and films, can be translated into ever more culturally determined prod ucts. All this is not to suggest some crude conspiracy on the part of the industrial chemists or physicists responsible for the color of the moving image. The above account draws attention to the existence of choices in the development of these processes and to suggest that in situations of choice, consciously or unconsciously, cultural determi nants will operate?as much in the scientific environment as any where. The Kodak experiment cited above speaks eloquently to how research is redolent of a specific culture: its results do not produce a film stock that can be readily manipulated to give good black skin tones. That this should warrant attention is only the result of the operations of media, technology, and, especially, media technology in the culture. These operations, in a sense hidden because transparent, conform perfectly to Barthes's explication of bourgeois ideology in general: that in such ideology, "the order of the world can be seen as sufficient or ineffable, it is never seen as significant."43 Indeed, so insignificant is it, that Western color film can supposedly be used as a tool against itself, as if a whole technology of dyeing had not intervened.

"costruzione legittina") as theorized by Alberti is the ground upon which the camera obscura portabilis' lens sits, but as Conolli (see footnote 9) correctly points out, this dominance was not without exceptions. It seems rather that Albertian perspective is somewhat beside the point, and the apparatus, as refined by Kepler, replicates the effects of the major alternative Dutch system in that no Albertian "window" is suggested between the artist and/or viewer, and the unified vanishing point, although capable of being accommodated to this system, was not as privileged as it was in Italy.

Therefore it is possible that the difficulties, originally highlighted by the inventors of other more diffused systems, have simply become part of the received history of photography and are more apparent than real. 22E.J.

Prime-time color programming was just starting and needed to be recorded for networking to the other coast. Kodak saw in lenticular color film an opportunity to stunt the development of videotape recording, at this point just emerging from the experimental stage. Between September 1956 and February 1958, the pioneering network in color, NBC, used Kodacolor film for making "hot" (i.e., fast) kinescopes; but in November of 1956 CBS transmitted the first videotaped program. Sixteen months later, NBC gave up and went to the videotape.
