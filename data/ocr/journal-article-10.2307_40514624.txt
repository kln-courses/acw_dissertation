Benenson collec- tion is unmistakably one of the rare known examples of the type in the nineteenth- century style of the "school of Moxico." The Chokwe people inhabit a vast terri- tory, often of mixed ethnicity, covering most of northeast Angola and areas of southwest Congo. Today, they also live, albeit in a more dispersed way, in several locations in north- western Zambia. They find their origin in a seventeenth-century offshoot of the Lunda Empire that would have been led by the chil- dren of the mythical cultural hero Chibinda Ilunga, a Luba hunter who is recalled in the myths of origin of the ethnicity. This hero is said to have introduced a number of then- modern hunting techniques, but also some new forms of magic and ritual as well as court manners. Such a central and exclusive figure is he in Chokwe mythology that most figurations of male chiefs in classical carvings in the style "of the country of origin" are identified as representing him.1 The notion of Chokwe carving style "of the country of origin" applies to artworks produced for royal courts throughout the nineteenth century by artists of the Chokwe ethnicity established in the Serra da Musamba plateau and the plains of the trib- utaries of the Upper Zambezi in Angola, the capital of which was Moxico, even though there was never such a thing as a centralised state. One will therefore talk of the "school of Musamba" and the "school of Moxico."2 Chokwe art became known to Europeans quite late in the colonial period. The first Europeans visited Chokwe courts only from 1878 onward. Besides, until the second third of the twentieth century, most artworks in those styles were poorly provenanced, and often attributed to other, better known, ethnic groups, such as the Lunda or the Ovimbundu. A large number of those col- lected in the nineteenth century were in fact acquired in the trading posts of the Atlantic coast, several hundred miles away from their place of origin, which rendered their identification difficult to the collectors and to the museum curators who subse- quently acquired them. The carvings of the "school of Musamba" reveal a rather schematic style, featuring rigid and stylised facial features, while the "Moxico school" style is more nuanced and more realistic, rendering human features in a way that seems to be portraiture. The "Moxico style" also makes a unique use of human hair for rendering scalp and facial hair on carvings, and frequently features Sceptre, Chokwe, Angola, 19th century (front) in the style of the Moxico school.

The Gallery's Chokwe sceptre, in spite of presenting a generic chiefly face, clearly belongs to this category on account of the smoother facial traits, the tuft of hair on the chin, and the bead necklace. The Moxico and Musamba styles mainly concern court art and are par- ticularly easy to distinguish if compared to the various styles that have characterised other artworks, like ritual objects, masks, or objects of daily life.3 The latter are more diversified and are not always ethnic-based; they often qualify as "regional styles" - that is, styles shared by several ethnic groups.4 A front view of the piece (frontispiece) shows that the sceptre, forty-five centimeters high, features a crowned head on top of a tri- angular incised tablet or cartouche. Chokwe sceptres are usually either anthropomorphic or cephalomorphic. The human figure on these staffs is invariably male and wears a chiefly crown known as mutwe wa kayanda. Some staffs with heads and figures have a sort of cartouche in the middle, often square, triangular, or rectangular, sometimes inter- rupted by convoluted lines reminiscent of old Portuguese coats of arms or religious art (fig. 4).5 Such artifacts were carved with small adzes (seso) and knives (poko), and subsequently polished with abrasive leaves (lupembe-úvèi is, Ficus exasperate Vahi). The wood (mutondo, a hard and light wood with a very fine grain) was sometimes darkened by smearing castor oil (mono) or dyes made with certain barks, but the characteristic patina of palatine carvings is the product of age and usage. Considering the craftsman- ship required and the consistency of certain very specific styles that can be attributed to individual carvers (songî) or ateliers, it is very likely that carvers were specialised profes- sionals, perhaps combining this activity, as in numerous other places in Central Africa, with that of blacksmith. Brass tacks are an uncommon feature on such carvings and, as observed on other collection pieces, may have been a later addition. Indeed, brass tacks appear profusely on late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century art, especially stools, where their role was purely decora- tive - not to secure the leather upholstery. Another peculiarity of this piece of carving is that it has no figuration of the ears, some- thing one can find in less than one in twenty anthropomorphic carvings in that style and might be characteristic of a specific master or atelier. The motifs on the cartouche (fig. 1), albeit well known, can hardly be interpreted without contextual information from users or makers. Each of these decorative motifs had a precise name and their combination could refer to qualities of the owner or of his chieftaincy. The two interlacing motifs at the</page><page sequence="4">71 top are known as chijingo. Often incised on the flat parts of musical instruments, like thumb-pianos and on combs, they are said to derive from a weaving motif.6 The set of imbricate squares immediately underneath is known as fiiliko, after the lid of the indige- nous beehive (ibidem). This may metaphor- ically link to the bee, one of the twelve emblems or totems in the former clan system (miyacht). The beehive also connotes the notion of family, as the combination of agnates and cognates. The set of opposing curved lines underneath are simply called mahenga, waves or curves. They have no intrinsic meaning. A three-quarters view of the head reveals the composition of the crown or headdress, which is that of a chief (fig. i). Although it is not precisely known what kind of crowns chiefs wore according to their status in the nineteenth century, comparative material exists to determine what is seen on the carving. A photograph of the Lunda chief Muteba (fig. 8), taken in 1908, shows a beaded coronet that features lateral curled flaps that compare to those of the sculpture. Note that the pose chosen offers a profile strikingly similar to that of the object! The Lunda are among the several peoples of the Upper Zambezi and Upper Kasai that were deeply influenced by Chokwe arts and court manners during the regional expansion of the latter in the course of the nineteenth century. Crowns and coronets were reported to have been made in leather, cloth, and also in brass leaves, those in cloth being made with a structure of assembled twigs and fully covered with rows of black, white, and red beads (misanga), as in the field photograph. It is not possible, however, to determine what the crown depicted in the carving was made of. A chiefly mask specific to the Chokwe is named Chihongo (figs. 5, 6, and 7). Like the headgear in the sceptre, it has a large, fan- like, undulating crown, known as chipenya mutwe. On the field photograph (fig. 5), one can see the prolonged "chin," which recalls Fig. 2.

CB265 the beard of the elders and the chiefs, like the tuft of hair in the staff. Whether this appendage actually represents a beard is sub- ject to discussion among specialists, but visu- ally at least, this is what it looks like. In the studio photograph of the same mask (fig. 6), one can observe a high ogival forehead com- parable to that on the sceptre. A high and bulging forehead, accentuated by shaving the hair in the front of the head, once was an ideal of beauty among the Chokwe.7 The main difference lies in the fact that the mask has feathers on the rim of its crown and in the back (see fig. 5), a feature that is never seen represented on carvings or on hats. Some chiefly crowns occasionally have a feather top {said), made with the red caudal feathers of the grey parrot, but this takes a a very different shape. The same mask, Chihongo, and a few chiefly others, like Chikungu (symbolising the ancestors of the chief) and Kalelwa, also sometimes feature the curly flaps on the sides known as mutwe wa kayanda. Looking from the side (fig. 2), we see the very careful attention given to the working of the profile. Attention to the profile view is indeed characteristic of the older Chokwe art. Here, one sees the regular curve of the crown, the prolonged face ending with the bearded chin, and the subtle figuration of the larynx. The sides of the triangular plate are finely incised. Those geometric designs, if looked at in segments, in the "herringbone pattern" denote fish scales to the Chokwe, chisonge cha yishi! 'If looked at as framing a vertical zigzag line, they either form a motif called mahenga mafo a chishilo (the sinuous leaf of a certain fern) or y enge, the line of opposed triangles seen on the back of the Gabon viper (Bitis gabonica) . This snake was equally an important chiefly symbol, "viper" being the title of the paramount Lunda chief Mwaant Yaav. Finally, the back of the piece (fig. 3) is also fully decorated with tusona designs. The larger area is covered with fes- toons, known as mahenga, or undulations. The lower section is decorated with a set of 7*</page><page sequence="6">angular lines called tukone. When they are incised in opposition by groups of four, as is the case here, they form a motif derived from weaving known as the "mat's eye." What the ensemble of those motifs was meant to convey or to state is unfortunately undecipherable. In the course of the nineteenth century, before the effective colonisation by the Por- tuguese, the Belgians, and to a certain extent, the British, Chokwe chiefs led their own colonial expansion, enslaving or taking over the control of several ethnicities over vast areas mostly to the north and the east of their country of origin, in present-day east- ern Angola, Congo (Kinshasa), and Zambia. Their superior military power developed by virtue of access to firearms, specifically muzzle-loading guns, in order to control several trades: wild plains rubber, beeswax, elephant ivory, slaves, and other products of the land.9 This trade provided them with great wealth, which they used to acquire imported goods (cloth and clothes, manufac- tured objects, guns, and so on), cattle and slaves (with a predilection for women and children, whom they incorporated in their households in the conquered lands), as well as precious regalia. Chiefs (mwanangana, plural myananganá) became extremely powerful by the middle of the nineteenth century because of their wealth, military power, and control of the trade routes.10 Like chiefs of the cognate ethnic groups, they were also pivotal in Chokwe etiology and worldview,11 their benevolence being required for efficacy in boys' initiation, masquerades, and healing, divining, and other areas of spiritual activity. To begin with, all important chiefs of the Chokwe and related peoples were (and still are) said to descend from Chibinda Ilunga, the mythical civilizing hero, and Lueji, the autochthonous Lunda princess he married. The Chokwe being hunters and farmers, the chiefs' supernatural powers ensured the fer- tility of the land and of the bush, and several rituals, like rituals of first fruits and ritual Fig. 4.

People willing to organise an initi- ation camp for the circumcision of young boys must first seek the authorisation of the chief. Once granted, the organisers will beg for an ember from the royal fire to light that of the initiation camp, thereby establishing a métonymie bond between the chief's powers and the ritual passage from boyhood to adulthood. The performance of masquer- ades also requires the chief's approval and blessing. More generally, all ritual specialists engaged in recitation of prayers, invocation of ancestors, or conversation with other spir- itual entities, whether in initiation, divina- tion, or healing, always refer to their chiefs as temporal and spiritual leaders, and as con- nections to ethnic ancestry and tradition (chisemwa). So associated is the chief with wealth, growth, and fertility that in the past people were not allowed to die in the sur- roundings of his village: those about to die had to be taken away. The chiefs' regalia consisted in finely carved objects such as spears, axes, masks, tobacco mortars (fig. 4) and pipes, stools, and chairs (fig. 9). Most of these objects, but not the sceptre, were at the same time badges of authority and utilitarian objects. They were inherited through the matrilineal side, together with the title of mwanangana, chief. For instance, chiefly stools, which became highly elaborate and precious com- modities, were closely associated with the person of the chief and with the office. They were real "throne," in the full sense of the term.12 A monoxyle stool carved in the style of the Kwilu-Kasai (Congo [Kinshasa]) (fig. 9) exemplifies the female principle of power filiation by its four caryatids and the carving of a woman in place of the back rest. A gift of the Compagnie du Kasaï to the Tervuren museum (Musée royal de l'Afrique centrale) in 1913, it has since then been exhibited as one of the finest pieces of Chokwe carving. This style, if related to the expansion period, when the Chokwe invaded the Kasaï area, retains many of the "Moxico 74</page><page sequence="8">75</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 8.

To begin with, it is a monoxyle chair, as opposed to the assembled ones that became the norm in the late nine- teenth century; like the sceptre, it is made in fine-grained hardwood and the main figure wears pieces of jewelry, like earrings and necklaces. It was also decorated with sparse imported brass tacks. The use of sceptres has hardly been documented by travellers or ethnographers. Badges of authority, they are held in the hand, either by the chief or by one of his retainers, in ceremonial events such as offi- cial receptions, traditional court hearings, 76</page><page sequence="10">77</page><page sequence="11">enthronements, and so on. In place of a sceptre, chiefs also use carved staffs, short clubs (sometimes carved like sceptres but retaining a heavy, rounded weight) or fly- whisks made with the tail of a gnu {pulii). If data from related ethnicities can be extrapo- lated, the sceptre, or the chiefly staff, could be taken by court retainers or messengers on their way to summon the chief's subjects at their homes to appear at the court for one reason or another. In that case the sceptres or staff, as witnessed among the Luvale of Zambia, asserts the authority of the emissary. The sceptres, like most other regalia, are indexes of social agency; they indicate the status of the owner and prescribe the attitude to observe with regard to the bearer. It was also suggested by the foremost scholar of Chokwe art, the late Marie-Louise Bastin, that those sceptres were used as commanding staffs. Unfortunately, because the use of sceptres in the classical styles of the country of origin was discontinued by the time of the first ethnographic campaigns, they could not be properly documented. The sceptres that were presented to informants for identi- fication in the late 1950s by Bastin had previ- ously been purchased in Portugal and sent back to Angola for identification by museum authorities. Such artworks, as heirlooms, were inher- ited from uncle to uterine nephew, from the chief to his successor. As chiefly courts were often mobile, especially during the period of expansion and colonisation of the peoples located east and north of the homeland, during the nineteenth century, chiefly regalia also travelled. Sometimes too, regalia could be offered as presents to another chief or looted and taken from an enemy as trophies during wars. It is in this way that a snuff- mortar sceptre produced in the Moxico region (Angola) before the mid-nineteenth century was later collected hundred of miles away, among the Chokwe of the Belgian Congo (fig. 4). Acquired between 1913 and 19 1 5 by Charles-Antoine Williame in Sandoa (Southwest Congo [Kinshasa]), the snuff- mortar sceptre of the Tervuren museum is also in the style of the "school of Moxico." Here, the characteristic "realism" of the style is expressed in the anthropomorphic motif: an individual playing the chisanje, a thumb- piano mounted on a calabash that serves as resonator. The male musician wears the same chiefly head gear or crown as on the Yale sceptre, the chipenya mutwe. Below comes a figuration of a drum, ngoma, the actual recipient for the snuff tobacco, and then a finely carved fretwork framed by scrolls reminiscent of Portuguese baroque. Although this is a mere hypothesis, one may wonder if the sceptre, like some ritual staffs, did not have a function in the cult of the ancestors. Indeed, during ritual prayers and offerings to the ancestors, objects asso- ciated to filiation (filiation of title, power, wealth, and fertility), like chiefly stools (vit- wamo), spears (mikuba), staffs, and bracelets (jikano), are displayed in front of the "tree of the ancestors" (muyombo), the place of worship and communion.13 This is especially the case at inheritance or name-giving cere- monies (kuswanyisa) . All those objects were far more than aesthetic creations designed to please the eye; they were at the same time ostentatious, symbolic, and quasi-religious in the sense that they all related to the benevo- lent powers of the lineage ancestors that war- rant the temporal powers of the living chief. The Yale Chokwe sceptre is a hitherto unpublished element of a limited corpus of nineteenth-century palatine art in the style of the school of Moxico. Having given some contextual information as to its origin and style, to further study the artwork would require comparison, from a morphological point of view, to the other fifteen-odd known sceptres in the same style. Some of those being better provenanced, the time and place of their collecting having been docu- mented, it might be possible to associate the Yale Chokwe sceptre with an even smaller ensemble. From the stylistic point of view too, certain features, like the absence of ears, 78</page><page sequence="12">the treatment of the profile and crown, or the style of the geometric designs, might lead to a specific atelier or carver. An identifica- tion of the wood and a comparative analysis of the patina might also provide further leads for a more precise identification, something this superb piece of carving certainly deserves in the future. i.
