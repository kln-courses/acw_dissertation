<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land Robert S. Lehman Cornell University This essay examines the formal role played by satire in the early drafts ofT.S. Eliot's The Waste Land. I argue that the precise character of this role comes into relief only when satire is located among the strategies Eliot marshals to reconcile the conflictualpoles of his poetics: the critical-historical and the creative, tradition and innovation. Satire appears in the drafts of The Waste Land as an immanent means of managing the excesses of literary history, as a way for the 'mature poet" to recollect the past while distinguishing himself from it. Accordingly, I suggest, satires disappearance from the final version of the poem, and its replacement by the so-called "mythical method, "signals satire s failure to accomplish the specific tasks that Eliot sets for it. Keywords: Eliot / satire / The Waste Land I tradition / Pope Over the last few decades, an assortment of books and articles have appeared that focus onT.S. Eliot's indebtedness to the comic tradition.1 Spurred on by the publication of Eliot's earliest?and coarsest?poetic sketches in Inventions of the March Hare, these studies share a distrust of the one-dimensional image of Eliot as a prematurely-aged conservative and tireless foe of the average man. In its place, they present an Eliot who laughed at slapstick, enjoyed the Lon don music halls, and, most importantly, incorporated these experiences into his poetry. Biographical concerns aside, the upshot of these studies is their success in revealing the persistence of the comic in Eliot's writings, from the early sketches, through the "Sweeney" poems, and including Eliot's masterpiece, The Waste Land. Because critics continue to read Eliot's poetry, and The Waste Land in particular, as the culmination of at least a certain strain of Anglo-American modernism, the potential significance of studies that question this poetry's elitism or traditional ism is no doubt great.2 What limits these studies qua readings of Eliot, however, is their unwillingness to see the comic as providing anything more than raw, thematic data for Eliot's art, fragments to be shored alongside passages from Petronius and allusions to Ovid. Content with demonstrating the presence of the comic in Eliot's poetry, they neglect its role in Eliot's poetics', that is, they do not ask why the comic may have been essential to Eliot's literary practice.</page><page sequence="2">66 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 2 My aim in what follows is to show that at least one form of the comic?sat ire?played a considerable formal role in Eliot's literary practice, and in the com position of The Waste Land in particular. The precise character of this formal role comes into relief only when satire is located among the strategies Eliot marshals to reconcile the poet's creative act with what Walter Bate memorably described as "the remorseless deepening of self-consciousness before the rich and intimidating legacy of the past" (4). Satire appeared in the early drafts of The Waste Land as an immanent means of managing literary history by reconciling the conflictual poles of Eliot's poetics: the critical-historical and the creative, tradition and innovation. Similarly, the disappearance of satire from the final version of Eliot's poem fol lowing the editorial suggestions of Ezra Pound, and satire's replacement by the so-called "mythical method," reflects satire's inability to accomplish this task. CATALYZING THE TRADITION Eliot addresses the modern poet's need to articulate the critical with the creative in his numerous references to the problem of tradition, most famously in "Tradition and the Individual Talent." In fact, we might understand Eliot's use of the term "tradition" as an attempt to facilitate this articulation by bringing the critical and the creative under a single concept. Tradition, Eliot argues, binds the temporal to the timeless, the living to the dead, the creative act to its context by making the writer "most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity" (38). Tradition conditions artistic success. The duty of the mature poet is, therefore, to "know everything that has been accomplished in poetry (accomplished, not merely produced) since its beginnings?in order to know what he is doing himself" ("War-paint" 1036). One does not "make it new" by forgetting those who came first. And yet, mastery of the tradition has a cost. Eliot presents the relationship between the poet and literary history as one of "continual self-sacrifice" ("Tradition" 40). The poet, finding himself amidst the works of all the writers who preceded him before he even puts pen to paper, sacrifices his biographical self?"the man who suffers" (40) ? to literary history. Any struggle to separate himself from literary history once and for all is doomed to failure as it provides the very material of his poetic creation, a fact as clear from Eliot's critical writings as from his endlessly allusive poetic output. Instead, the poet must empty himself of every biographical contingency and open himself to the tradition's truths. The space of the poet's de personalized mind is the space in which the "gasses" of literary history "catalyze" (41), the space in which the new is born of the old. Though de-personalized, the poet remains an essential part of this process. Novelty is possible because "the conscious present is an awareness of the past in a way and to an extent which the past's awareness of itself cannot show" ("Tradition" 39). The full meaning of the past appears only in hindsight. The distinction between the poet at the moment of artistic creation and the literary past that provides him with his materials is, then, not so much ontological as perspectival: the poet, though never ceasing to be a part of the tradition, possesses a knowledge of the tradition</page><page sequence="3">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land 67 that the tradition necessarily lacks. As Eliot notes, "someone said: 'The dead writers are remote from us because we know so much more than they did.' Precisely, and they are that which we know" (40). The act of creation is nothing but the moment of knowledge that occurs when the tradition?through the production of "the new (the really new) work of art" (38)?reflects on itself. In short, through the poet, literary history achieves self-awareness.3 A dramatic instantiation of this process occurs in Eliot's early lyrics, for example, "Gerontion," first published in 1920 and briefly intended to serve as the "prelude" to The Waste Land {Letters 504). "Gerontion" is an interesting poem not only because of its own considerable merits ? it is arguably the most fully realized of Eliot's pre- Waste Land lyrics ? or because it so clearly anticipates the themes of The Waste Land, but because it dra matizes the theory of poetic creation that Eliot was developing at the time of its composition. Essentially, the poem presents a melancholic consciousness unable to transform past experience into present action. The lyrical "I" is an old man who laments his fate as the dupe of an anthropomorphized history. Thus, the poem's best known lines: "History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors / And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions / Guides us by vanities" {CollectedPoems 35-37).The speaker has been lost among history's distractions and has recognized his failings only too late. Because he seems to have spent his life entranced by the objects of literary history in particular?he alludes to Dante, Shakespeare, and Lancelot Andrewes ? it is tempting to read the speaker as an avatar of the man Eliot could himself become, and thus to read the poem as Eliot's proleptic self-critique. Yet the difficulties of sustaining this reading are clear enough. If the speaker of "Gerontion" doubts the compatibility of the literary historical and the creative, the immersive study of the tradition and the generation of the really new work, such that what is "kept" of literary history will always be "adulterated" (58-59), he opposes absolutely the position that Eliot sets forth explicitly in his critical writings and implicitly in his allusive poems (including "Gerontion" itself). Nonetheless, the speaker is more than just a negative example of Eliot's praxis; rather, his failure to make of history anything more than a series of disconnected memories occasions the poem's success. Eliot's poem culminates in a broken series of images, and finally in a wilder ness of mirrors and a whirl of "fractured atoms." And yet, the chaos that the poem presents remains wholly circumscribed by a relatively coherent consciousness, as evinced by the speaker's first words: "Here I am." Although "Gerontion" may describe a failure to order history, this failure cannot be separated from the voice that laments it. The poem's speaker may move somewhat associatively between thoughts, but he remains one speaker. The structure I am describing is, of course, the structure of lyric: a single poem spoken in a single voice. In the context of the struggle with literary history that "Gerontion" initiates, however, lyric is fundamen tally a defensive strategy, a means of mastering an essentially linguistic confusion by locating it in the relatively stable relationship between a mind and a world. Through the lyric voice, "Gerontion" presents a disharmony of moments, and ends, appar ently, in the assertion of complete chaos. It presents this chaos, however, within</page><page sequence="4">68 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 2 the strictures of a form?the lyric?that cannot but remind the reader that this chaos, this whirl of atoms, is all located within the confines of a single conscious ness: lamento ergo sum.The poem divides itself, then, between what it says and what it does. It says that history is an unmasterable nightmare of missed opportunities even as it synthesizes this history in the form of the lyric. The irony of this process results from the disconnect between the man who surfers ? thematized in the poem as the lyrical "I"? and the "mind" that creates ? an effect of the generic operations of the lyric itself.4 This ruse of (lyrical) reason functions in Eliot's early poetry as a more or less successful means of poetic synthesis, and thus as an enactment of Eliot's poetic theory. In The Waste Land, however, the expansion of the poem beyond the form of the lyric presents new difficulties insofar as the synthesizing activities of a single (lyrical) consciousness can no longer be relied on, while the same threat of liter ary historical disorder thematized in "Gerontion" persists. The question, then, is how the poem achieves the requisite "ironic distance" from the lamentations of its speaker when ? as is the case with The Waste Land? the poem's "speaker" is not any identifiable subject but seems to be literary history itself. Satire, at least during Eliot's composition of the early drafts of The Waste Land, initially presented itself as a possible answer. Why this would have been the case will be my concern in the next section. MASTERS OF HATRED In his "Reflections on Vers Libre," published in the New Statesmen in 1917, Eliot concludes his discussion of the most modern tendencies in verse with a nod to a moment from the literary past that, he argues, ought to determine the literary future: "We only need the coming of a Satirist?no man of genius is rarer?to prove that the heroic couplet has lost none of its edge since Dryden and Pope laid it down" (36). Elsewhere, he discusses the satirical acumen of Dryden, Pope, and Swift, referring to them as the "great masters" of, respectively, "contempt,""hatred," and "disgust" ("Andrew Marvell" 162). Eliot's references to satire are significant, even beyond their status as additional cases of modernism's valorization of classi cal forms. In Eliot s Dark Angel, Ronald Schuchard details the importance of this comic mode to Eliot's early development, noting that "as he began to write the Sweeney poems in 1918, Eliot immersed himself in the savage and violent tradi tion of English comedy, from Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson to Charles Dickens, thence to the most contemporary manifestation of the ferocious comic in England ? his bawdy friend Wyndham Lewis" (89). For a moment, Eliot seemed to believe that satire carried the hopes of literary modernism. Eliot shared his interest in satire with the other "Men of 1914." "Satire" was the term Ezra Pound chose to describe his own early Vorticist experiments (Hofer 463); and Pound remained attached to this term, so that on receiving Poetry maga zine's Harriet Monroe Memorial Prize in 1962, he described himself (albeit with a bit of false modesty) as only a "minor satirist" (qtd. in Kenner Pound Era 556).</page><page sequence="5">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land 69 Lewis, however, has perhaps the best claim to being the satirical "man of genius" whose coming Eliot foretold, and Schuchard is right to single him out. Lewis spilled more ink on the subject of satire than any other early-twentieth-century writer, and he completed what was probably the greatest work of modernist satire, The Apes of God, a brutal attack on the mores of the 1920s London literati (and the Sitwells and the Bloomsbury group, in particular). As befit his bellicose character, Lewis understood satire as an unequivocally combative form. Thus, we read in the first Vorticist Manifesto: "We only want tragedy if it can clench its side muscles like hands on it's [sic] belly, and bring to the surface a laugh like a bomb" (31). This Nietzschean coupling of laughter and destruction Lewis justifies only later: the greatest satire is "non-moral," he reasons, "because no mind of the first order, expressing itself in art, has ever itself been taken in, nor consented to take in oth ers, by the crude injunctions of any purely moral code" {Men without Art 89). The non-moral satirist does not justify herself by looking to any pre-existent social standards; everyone and everything is, therefore, a potential target. Eliot himself was never so indiscriminate, but at least one aspect of satire's promise ? for Eliot and for modernism more generally?is implicit in Lewis'remarks. For modernist authors, satire was above all a tool by means of which they could distinguish their works and themselves from the fallen products of mass culture, as well as from the (no less fallen) mass of producers. The satirist mocks so as to demonstrate that he or she has not "been taken in" by society at large. As Lewis reiterates in his autobi ography, "we are all in the melting pot. I resist the process of melting so have a very lively time of it" {Blasting 15).5 Satire promises a bulwark against melting, against the omnipresent threat of cultural indistinction. Eliot, no less than Pound or Lewis, saw this threat everywhere. In what is ostensibly an obituary for the music-hall performer Marie Lloyd, he notes that, [w]hen every theater has been replaced by 100 cinemas, when every music instrument has been replaced by 100 gramophones, when every horse has been replaced by 100 cheap motor-cars, when electrical ingenuity has made it possible for every child to hear its bedtime stories from a loudspeaker, when applied science has done everything possible with the materials on this earth to make life as interesting as possible, it will not be surprising if the population of the entire civilized world rapidly follows the fate of the Melanesians. (174) The technological homogenization of culture presages our extinction. Here, Eliot follows the arguments of W.H.R. Rivers's Essays on the Depopulation of Melanesia {1922). As he describes Rivers's findings, "the natives of the unfortunate archipel ago are dying out principally for the reason that the 'Civilization forced upon them has deprived them of all interest in life. They are dying from pure boredom" (174). We risk sharing the demise of the Melanesians for the cultural reasons noted above, as well as for the failures of our political system: "The middle classes, in England as elsewhere, under democracy, are morally dependent on the aristocracy, and the aristocracy are subordinate to the middle class, which is gradually absorbing and destroying them. The lower class still exists; but perhaps it will not exist for long"</page><page sequence="6">70 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 2 (173). Eliot's quarrel in this essay is less with the rise of the lower classes than with a general move toward the middle, in which "the lower classes will tend to drop into the same state of protoplasm as the bourgeoisie" (174). The tendency of our culture is not toward the extremes of the aristocracy or the lower classes, but to a deadened equilibrium typical of bourgeois society. Satire resists this sort of equilibrium. Thus, Fredric Bogel usefully describes the "first satiric gesture" as one in which the satirist "makes a difference by setting up a textual machine or mechanism for producing difference" (42). What is sati rized is always what is already dangerously close. Literary satire, beyond its merely comic effect, establishes a system of differentiation by means of which the satirist is able both to evoke this dangerous proximity and to manage it. Satire, then, is a "ritual of separation" (43), a means of overcoming the unsettling nearness of the undesirable?in short, a refusal to melt. Although Bogel is primarily concerned with Augustan satire, that is, with the same classical eighteenth-century texts that so appealed to Eliot, we can find the same logic operating in the modernist appropriation of satire. If Alexander Pope perfected a "machine" by which cultural rubbish and the "scribblers" and "dunces" who generated it could be disavowed, a machine that worked to set Pope's own writings apart from his Grub Street contemporaries, modernist writers felt a comparable need for discrimination, as Eliot's contemporary Richard Aldington shows in writing that "the arts are now divided between popular charlatans and men of talent, who, of necessity, write, think and paint only for each other, since there is no one else to understand them" (37). The division between charlatans and men of talent was hardly as certain as Aldington's remark would suggest. In recent years a number of critics have noted modernism's proximity to, or even reliance on, the very marketing strategies of its hated mass-cultural other;6 yet, with the market's penetration into all forms of life during the period of high modernism, the need to insist on the reality of such a stark opposition, however wishful it was, could only intensify. When satire enters Eliot's writings in the early drafts of The Waste Land, it likewise does so as a means of managing a dangerous proximity. Once again, the threat comes from the denigrated products of a fallen culture and from the pos sibility that the distinction between the high and the low might prove undecidable. All of this is in keeping with the modernist turn to satire. Eliot differs from his contemporaries, however, in that he locates the source of this threat in the poetic act itself in its indebtedness to the tradition. The culture of sterility and decay that The Waste Land presents is not simply an effect of the wrong sort of people making art; it is a danger implicit in the synthetic act of artistic creation insofar as this act?as Eliot theorizes it?comes perilously close to the mechanical repetitions of the past that characterize the modern waste land. The role that satire plays in managing these repetitions is my focus in what follows.</page><page sequence="7">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land 71 SATIRE IN THE WASTELAND As I noted above, the importance of satire to the construction of The Waste Land appears most vividly in the early drafts, composed in Switzerland while Eliot was convalescing following a nervous disorder and delivered to Pound for editorial corrections in January 1922. In these drafts, Eliot toys with Pope himself. Thus, in a draft of "The Fire Sermon," the first stanza reads: Admonished by the sun's inclining ray, And swift approaches of the thievish day, The white-armed Fresca blinks, and yawns, and gapes, Aroused from dreams of love and pleasant rapes. Electric summons of the busy bell Brings brisk Amanda to destroy the spell; With coarsened hand, and hard plebian tread, Who draws the curtain round the lacquered bed, Depositing thereby a polished tray Of soothing chocolate, or stimulating tea. {The Waste Land: A Facsimile 1?10) The poem continues in heroic couplets for sixty-two more lines. Eliot's allusion to Pope's own satirical Rape of the Lock is apparent in the mention of "pleasant rapes," as well as in the stanza's form (heroic couplets) and content (a scene of awakening). Eliot describes the daily activities of a woman, "Fresca" (a modern stand-in for Pope's "Belinda"), who has already made a very brief appearance as one in a series of names in "Gerontion" {Collected Poems 68). In Eliot's draft of "The Fire Sermon," however, she is quite literally fleshed out, defined initially solely in terms of her bodily functions ? sleeping and awakening, then drinking, eating, and defecating. Awakened from sexual dreams, she begins her day with chocolate or tea, retreats to the bathroom, returns to bed, eats an egg, relaxes in a bath, and so on. As the stanza progresses, however, Fresca reveals herself as a consumer not just of chocolate, tea, and eggs, but of culture as well, an avid reader with eclectic tastes. On the toilet,". . . the pathetic tale of Richardson / Eases her labor till the deed is done" {The Waste Land: A Facsimile 13-14); she "explores a page of Gibbon as she eats" (16); and while she lies in a bath, we learn that "Fresca was baptized in a soapy sea / of Symonds - Walter Pater - Vernon Lee. / The Scandinavians bemused her wits / the Russians thrilled her to hysteric fits" (56-59). In these lines, the distinc tion between physical consumption and intellectual consumption is rather blurry. Fresca does not read the letters that she receives; rather, she "devours" them (19). On the other hand, she "sinks in revery" while contemplating the "well-rounded dome" of a hard-boiled egg (17-18). In short, she fails to distinguish high litera ture not just from mass forms but from any other consumable object. She enacts a largely mindless ingestion of culture (actions that position her more or less com fortably within the binary that opposes male production to female consumption). But Fresca's activities are complicated. Like the speaker of "Gerontion," she lives a vicarious life, a life of "Unreal emotions, and real appetite" (53).That is, while</page><page sequence="8">72 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 2 her bodily desires persist, her emotional experiences come second-hand from the texts she consumes. But unlike the speaker of "Gerontion,"who cannot pass from literary-historical reminiscence to present action, Fresca does create something: "She scribbles verse of such a gloomy tone / That cautious critics say her style is quite her own" (65-66). And here Eliot's specific satirical target comes into view. The threat that Fresca personifies is not the threat of the creative sterility of "Gerontion," but that of a certain poetic (re)production. Fresca moves all too eas ily from the consumption of Gibbon, Richardson, and Pater to the generation of her own gloomy verse. Indeed, passing from the consumption of the tradition to the production of verse is for Fresca nearly as thoughtless, as automatic, as passing from the consumption of tea and chocolates to the production of bodily waste. And examples of her automatism abound. The speaker notes of Fresca that "when restless nights distract her brain from sleep / she may as well write poetry, as count sheep" (62-63). As automatic as counting, Fresca's poetic creation is practically somnambulistic. Fresca figures a threat inherent in the very act of literary-historical recollec tion prescribed in Eliot's critical writings. Her behavior is dangerously close to the behavior of the mature poet: she reads fairly widely from the Western European tradition and out of these excursions into literary history she creates her art. Though one could argue that Fresca is perhaps too reliant on the Decadents, or that she responds too emotionally to the texts she encounters (at least to those texts written by the amusing Scandinavians and the thrilling Russians), none of these criticisms are by themselves sufficient to distinguish her practice from the practice that Eliot celebrates and himself embodies. When in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," Eliot describes the poet's mind as "a receptacle for seizing and storing up number less feelings, phrases, images, which remain there until all the particles which can unite to form a new compound are present together" (41), his preferred analogy is to the chemical reaction that occurs between oxygen and sulphur dioxide in the presence of platinum. This process is all too close to Fresca's own digestion of the tradition; indeed, Eliot even refers to the poet's creative process as a "digestion" (41). Like Eliot's mature poet, Fresca sacrifices herself to an impersonal (because automatic) activity. Thus, she goes on scribbling, beguiled by her "flattering friends" and championed by "cautious critics." The problem posed by Fresca is as central to Eliot's drafts of "He Do the Police in Different Voices" as it is to The Waste Landin its final incarnation. What characterizes the modern waste land if not an ineluctable passage from the high to the low, from the first appearance of superior art to its digestion by a mediocre culture and its return in a fallen form? Everything in the waste land?all of literary history?returns degraded. The problem extends beyond mass culture's consump tion, digestion, and excretion of formerly great works; to recollect literary history at all is to risk being implicated in the same crimes. This process is thematized again and again in the poem, initially through figures of seasonal repetition and organic decay?the sprouting corpse that appears in "The Burial of the Dead," for example, or the rotting Sybil of the poem's epigraph?but in more recognizably</page><page sequence="9">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land 73 literary-historical terms as well. In the second section of the poem, "A Game of Chess," a fractured series of questions?'"Do7 'You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember' / 'Nothing?'" (The Waste Land, ed. North 121-123)?is answered with what ought to be a definitive gesture to the literary tradition: "I remember / Those are pearls that were his eyes" (124-125). Summoned from the "ideal order" of the literary past ("Tradition" 38), Ariel's speech from The Tem pest momentarily re-members the dis-membered queries that precede it. But no sooner is the bard invoked than he falls to waste, as Ariel's speech slides smoothly into the memory of a popular tune that Eliot might have heard playing on "100 gramophones": "But / O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag - / It's so elegant / So intelligent" (127-130). No work, apparently, is immune to its recurrence in a fallen form. As the speaker of "Gerontion" feared, to "keep," to remember, is to "adulter ate." This passage from the high to the low, from Shakespeare to "Shakespehere," reveals how porous the putative distinction between high and low really is, a fact supported by some lines from "That Shakesperian Rag" that Eliot chooses not to quote: "Bill Shakespeare never knew / of ragtime in his days, / But the high browed rhymes, / Of his syncopated lines, / You'll admit, admit, surely fit / any song that's now a hit" (qtd. The Waste Land, ed. North 51-54). Shakespeare "fits" into ragtime just as Gibbon, Richardson, and Pater "fit" into Fresca's verse. Satire provides Eliot with the means of distinguishing his own catalyses of literary history from these digestions and fallen repetitions. In this capacity, satire works on two related levels. First, and most obviously, Eliot's use of the satirical mode in the drafts of "The Fire Sermon"?clearly signaled by his pastiche of Pope's Rape of the Lock?allows him to insist on a difference between his own poetic practice and the automatic practices embodied by the lady Fresca. Again, satire's vocation is to "make a difference" where we find at first only a threatening proxim ity. The real content of the difference between Eliot's and Fresca's reproductions of literary history may be effectively indiscernible, but the very fact of satirical pre sentation introduces a formal distinction between these reproductions. By mocking Fresca, Eliot locates his own practice within a position of greater authenticity, or at least greater knowledge, even if at this point these terms are relatively empty. That Fresca's verse can be satirized points to a failing in her verse that neither Fresca, nor her friends, nor her too-cautious critics can perceive. Moreover, once satire is in place in the poem, it provides the content for the formal differentiation that it engenders. This content is satire itself. Against Fresca's digestive syntheses of literary history, Eliot proffers satire as an alternative model for managing the tradition. The fundamental distinction between these two modes ? digestive and satirical?is that while Fresca recollects the tradition automatically, the satirist recollects it critically. Satire insists on a division between itself and its literary-historical object, even as it serves as the vessel of this object's presentation. Bemused by the Scandinavians and thrilled to hysteric fits by the Russians, Fresca is not psychically distinct from the texts that she consumes and repeats. The satirist, on the other hand, is not at stake in the game, not wholly a part of the practices that he condemns.</page><page sequence="10">74 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 2 Here, the significance of satire to the formal construction of The Waste Land comes into view. Like Fresca's verse, The Waste Land is a poetic anamnesis of literary history; thus, it risks appearing indistinguishable from the degraded repetitions of classic texts that Fresca carries out. How, for example, can The Waste Land establish that its own repetitions of Dante, or Wagner, or Shakespeare are not of the same order as Fresca's gloomy verse or "That Shakesperian Rag"? Satire provides (or ought to provide) The Waste Land with the means to distinguish itself from the products of the modern waste land even as it partakes in the practice of literary recollection that calls these products forth. Without this critical distance secured by satire, Eliot would become Fresca, his degraded double. THE ABSENCE OF SATIRE IN THE WASTELAND Ezra Pound was, however, unamused. Reflecting on the composition of The Waste Land in 1928, Eliot notes that Pound "induced me to destroy what I thought an excellent set of couplets; for, said he, Tope has done this so well that you cannot do it better; and if you mean this as a burlesque, you had better suppress it, for you can not parody Pope unless you can write better verse than Pope ? and you can't'" (The Waste Land: A Facsimile 127). The seventy-two lines of heroic couplets with which Eliot intended to begin "The Fire Sermon" were a casualty of the self-proclaimed "sage homme" of The Waste Land, another cut in Pound's "caesarean" delivery of the poem.7 If, in 1928, Eliot could still describe the excised couplets as "excellent," by 1929, he appears to have wholly internalized Pound's criticisms, warning aspiring poets that "if you follow Dante without talent, you will at worst be pedestrian and flat; if you follow Shakespeare or Pope without talent, you will make an utter fool of yourself" ("Dante" 217). Soon after Valerie Eliot's publication of the drafts of The Waste Land in 1971, a number of critics voiced their agreement with Pound that Eliot's attempt to revive the satirical mode was a failure, though each filled in the ultimate reason for this failure with his or her own reading. Building on Hugh Kenner's argument in "The Urban Apocalypse," Philip Cohen notes that "a comparison of The Rape of the Lock to Eliot's parody shows how mistaken Eliot was in his conception of Pope. Eliot has none of Pope's occasional playfulness and very real fascination with Belinda" (19). Cohen goes on to remark that the disgust of female physicality Eliot exhibits in this section tells us more about Eliot himself than about Fresca. David Ward, on the other hand, resists the temptation to analyze the poem's author, and states in language as direct as Pound's own that "the parody is for the most part nerveless and slack" (100). More recently, Marjorie Perloff has combined these positions: the lines that Pound "slashed," she writes, are both "offensive" and "weak" (174). Though they may endorse Pound's editorial decisions, all of these critics ignore what is most essential in Pound's criticism: the surprising suggestion that Eliot's aim was to "parody Pope," to satirize the master of hatred himself. It is perhaps true that Eliot's couplets do not equal Pope's in wit or precision, and that Eliot descends into cruelty (perhaps learned from Lewis) where Pope remains playful,</page><page sequence="11">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land 75 but Pound's suggestion that Eliot intended to parody Pope seems, on the surface, implausible. Pope himself wrote in the style of the ancients to take the wind out of his contemporaries' sails; it was no doubt clear to his readers that his target was not Horatio and Homer but rather those "scribblers" who would claim their legacy. When in The Rape of the Lock he describes the titular theft of hair in terms and tones borrowed from Homer's description of Paris'abduction of Helen of Troy, his aim is to mock the smallness of his contemporaries by opposing their own trivial affairs to Homer's gigantomachia. Similarly, when Eliot mocks Fresca in the style of Pope, who would imagine that Pope himself is the real butt of the joke? Nonetheless, this seems to be Pound's odd suggestion. And yet, there is more to this suggestion than meets the eye. If, in 1922, Eliot was so ready to take Pound's advice, and to consign Fresca to the waste-paper basket, it is likely because he recognized the truth of Pound's comments: in sum, whatever Eliot imagined himself to be doing when he drafted the first, Popeian lines of "The Fire Sermon," the effect of these lines must be to satirize Pope himself. That The Waste Lands satirical recollection of literary history necessarily impli cates Pope results from the poem's unusually ambitious scope. The Waste Land'con stitutes an attempt to recollect literary history from its Western and non-Western origins to its most recent incarnations. In this sense, The Waste Land returns Eliot to a persistent interest, one that he first articulated with reference to FH. Bradley's organic holism: an "all-inclusive experience outside of which nothing shall fall" {Knowledge and Experience 31). All literary history is, at least potentially, a part of the waste land that The Waste Land critically?which is to say, satirically?pres ents. But if satire appears in The Waste Land not only to manage the dangerous proximity of this or that "other," but also, and more importantly, to recollect criti cally literary history itself, where in this process do we locate the satires of Pope (and Horace, Juvenal, Swift, Lewis, and so on)? Herein lies the difficulty. Pope is clearly a part of the literary-historical waste land that satire is supposed to recollect, and so are Pope's satires. If they were not, Eliot would be unable to draw on them for the first seventy-two lines of "The Fire Sermon." If Eliot's Popeian satire is to differentiate The Waste Land from the literary-historical waste land, then, it must differentiate The Waste Land from Pope; moreover, Eliot's Popeian satire must dif ferentiate The Waste Land from Popeian satire. And here Pound's confusion about the target of Eliot's satire is understandable. In The Waste Land, "Pope"(the satirical style) must help to separate The Waste Land not just from Pope (the poet subject to the cycles of literary history) but from "Pope" (the satirical style) as well; each is implicated in the tradition to be satirized, and each is capable of returning in a degraded form. As Pound recognized, Pope (like "Pope") is necessarily intended in Eliot's "burlesque" because Pope is very much a part of the literary-historical waste land that The Waste Land describes. If satire must distinguish The Waste Land {torn literary history, satire must also distinguish itself from satire. Satire must, satirically, distinguish itself from itself. If satire is to remain the model for a critical recollection of the tradition in toto, it can only do so as the satire of satire. But if this is the case, the promise of satire</page><page sequence="12">76 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 2 to separate poets from dunces, to separate Eliot from Fresca, or to separate The Waste Land from the waste land, becomes confused. What becomes of satire, with its " gratifyingly idealized . . . coherence of self and other" (Bogel 46), when "self" and "other" are not just dangerously similar but demonstrably the same thing? The closer Eliot comes to approximating the masterful satire of Pope, the more difficult it becomes to distinguish Eliot from Pope, or to distinguish Eliot's satire of satire from Pope's satire. In The Waste Land, then, satire (of satire) ends up inviting the dangerous proximity of literary history (including satire) that it was supposed to manage. The relatively stable system of differences promised by satire as a generic form dissolves into a vertigo of undecidable self-parody, a state of affairs akin to what Friedrich Schlegel, in a discussion of the related operations of irony, described as il eine permanente Parekbase"'&amp; permanent parabasis' (18:85). Satire is absent from the finished version of The Waste Land'because in the early drafts of the poem, those drafts cut to ribbons by Pound, its work proves undecid able. In these drafts, we cannot establish, finally, whether what we read is satire, or satire of satire. Consequently, there is no way to establish whether the poem has successfully distinguished itself from the literary-historical repetitions that it thematizes ? a process that seems increasingly akin to a person's lifting himself by his own hair. This is the fate of The Waste Land insofar as it seeks within literary history an immanent principle for the ordering of literary history. On the other hand, if literary history cannot be successfully recollected by an immanent con sciousness or generic technique, it must be transcended. An awareness of this fact necessitated Eliot's turn to the "mythical method," in essence a turn to a principle outside of, or prior to, the tradition in which every satirical gesture, no matter how self-aware, must remain.

See, for example, Chinitz; Faulk; Johnson; Schuchard. 2. In A Genealogy of Modernism, Michael Levenson notes that, unlike much of the London avant-garde, "Eliot himself did not join the attack on tradition. He did not chant with the Vorticists that 'Life is the Past and the Future. The Present is Art.'He thus entered the debate at an opportune moment to assert the need for the regenerating example of past forms" (158). Here, Eliot figures a vision of modernism reconciled with its status as a moment in the great tradition of Western art; he thus eases the transition between two senses of "modernism"?modernism as rupture and modernism as institution. Franco Moretti, coming to Eliot's poetry with a very different set of assumptions, nonetheless positions The Waste Land as the capstone of the "last literary season' of Western culture (209). 3. My use of the more or less idealist notion of (literary) history achieving self-awareness is not accidental. The likelihood that Eliot's theorization of the tradition originated in the neo-Hegelian</page><page sequence="13">Eliot's Last Laugh: The Dissolution of Satire in The Waste Land 77 philosopher F.H. Bradley's organic holism, on which Eliot wrote his doctoral dissertation, has been well documented. In The Invisible Poet, Hugh Kenner notes that we find in Eliot's writings "evidence for his unqualified ingestion of certain perspectives of Bradley's which one does not discover him ever to have repudiated" (45), while in a more recent book, M.A.R. Habib identifies Bradley's appeal with an intra-philosophical resistance to cultural fragmentation, writing that "the philosophies of Bradley, [Josiah] Royce and other [late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century] neo-Hegelian idealists might be viewed as a last ditch attempt to retain the larger unifying synthesis against the disintegrative onslaught of positivism and realism" (13). 4. Here, I am following fairly closely the work of Paul de Man, particularly the reading of Baudelaire's "Correspondances" and "Obsession" that de Man develops in his late essay "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric." De Man insists that "the lyric is not a genre, but one name among several to desig nate the defensive motion of understanding, the possibility of a future hermeneutics" (261). Bracketing for a moment de Man's more extreme assertions regarding the possibility of the lyric as a genre, we can still recognize in "Gerontion" the "defensive motion" that he describes: a more or less stable couple "I/you" or "I/it" substitutes for an irrational ? and potentially unmanageable ? accumulation of linguistic fragments. 5. For a discussion of these lines that relates them to Lewis's notion of a non-moral satire, see Miller, 47-49. 6. Lawrence Rainey, for example, details this complex relationship of modernism to commodity culture as follows: "Modernism," he observes, is a strategy whereby the work of art invites and solicits its commodification, but does so in such a way that it becomes a commodity of a special sort, one that is temporarily exempted from the exigencies of immediate consumption prevalent within the larger cultural economy, and is instead integrated into a different economic circuit of patronage, collecting, speculation, and investment?activities that precisely in this period begin to encroach upon and merge into one another in unexpected ways. Modernism marks neither a straightforward resistance nor an outright capitulation to commidification but a momentary equivocation that incorporates elements of both in a brief, necessarily unstable synthesis.

The first three stanzas of "Sage Homme" read: These are the Poems of Eliot By the Uranian Muse begot; A Man their Mother was, A Muse their Sire.
