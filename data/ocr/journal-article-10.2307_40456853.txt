<plain_text><page sequence="1">Analecta et Additamenta NIodima and G/awama. - In his review of G. B. Silberbauer's "Report to the Government of Bechuanaland on the Bushman Survey" (Gaberones 1965; reviewed in Anthropos 61. 1966, p. 346 s.) Professor Martin Gusinde pays special attention to NIodima and G/awama, the two main supernatural beings of the G/wi. Of these, N lodima is believed to live in heaven; to have a human shape, although he is invisible; to be the Creator and the Owner of the world and the Giver of life ; but at present "he lives in a state of semi-retirement" (Silberbauer, p. 95). G/awama "is conceived of in semi-anthropomorphic form" (p. 96) and less powerful than N lodima. Gusinde conjectures that the designation G/awama coincides with //Gauwa or I/Gaua, used by the !Kung Bushmen of Angola as name for their highgod. If that conjecture is correct, he thinks that the first and only highgod of the G/wi, i. e. G/awama, has been displaced by what he calls a „Nebengottheit", a „secondary deity", viz. by NIodima. In the past, not enough attention has been paid to the stratification of African religious concepts. Gusinde's assumption would, therefore, seem quite plausible. Still, I should like to draw the attention of investigators to some facts which have to be con- sidered in this connection. There is first of all the fact that NIodima and G/awama or their equivalents occur as a pair in a much wider area than Bochwana or the Bushman religion. The Pedi, Mala- boch, Venda, Karanga, and Ndebele call the two main "bones" or "dice" in their divi- nation set of four Thoagadime - Legoame, Chuadima - Lekhuamen, Thwalima - Hwami, Tokwadzima (Tokwadima) - Kwami, and Dagwadime - Kwami respectively (v. Sicard 1959, p. 27; Garbutt, p. 52; cf. Howman, p. 389 s.; Wilder, p. 23, mentions Tshituk- wadzima as "the most important card [or lot], a sort of ace" among the 6-20 "lots" used by the Ndau of P. E. A., while another lot is known as Kwami). Thus in divination, the combination of the equivalents of N lodima and G/awama is constant. It cannot be regarded as accidental and it must be at least as old as the system of divination with the four bones or dice itself. In literature the "quatuor sudes" are first mentioned in connection with the death of Father Silveira on the Zambezi in 1561 (Godigno, p. 114). We are not yet in a position to determine how old this system is, but this much can be stated that morphologically the dice represent a combination of different cultural components, of which one is doubtless of Bushman origin (cf. the four Namib-Bushmen "dice", two male and two female, reproduced by Baumann (1940, p. 80), while another element, the "interlace design" ("Flechtbandornament", Bent, p. 38) indicates a connection with the Ancient Eastern Mediterranean Culture (v. Sicard 1964, p. 20 s.). As a matter of fact, Stayt (p. 255) has suggested that their use "originated in the Zimbabwe area and is associated with the old Zimbabwe culture". To Tracey (p. 23) the names of the "bones appear to be archaic". Baumann (1955, p. 34 s.) has ascribed the "bisexual dice" ("das doppelgeschlechtliche Würfelorakel") to the "steppe hunters' cul- ture", and Haberland is of the opinion that, in the last instance, survivals of this culture</page><page sequence="2">208 Analecta et Additamenta Anthropos 62. 1967 in East Africa can at least to a certain degree be explained satisfactorily by assuming influences of "an archaic high-culture" (p. 569 s.). As to the meaning of the two names, Nfodima is etymologically related to Ur- Bantu limu "supernatural being", "spirit"; Swahili ku-zimu "in the grave", "under the earth"; m-zimu 1. "ancestor spirit", 2. "place of offerings where spirits dwell"; Yaka mi-simi or mi-sima "esprits qui habitent les termitières" (Andersson, p. 117); late Jewish timi, Babylonian etimmê "ancestor spirits", Accadian etimmu "ghost", and old Assyrian dim "demon". This leads us again to the Ancient Near East. There, the word is not used in regard to a deity. - Two rather uncommon senses of the word are also worth to be kept in mind. Mohr (I, p. 301) rendered in 1875 the Tswana word logadima as "lightning" ; and among the Yeke (Congo) mukwelima is the term used for a son-in-law who works for his wife; according to Olderogge (p. 25) it is to be derived from -lima "till the ground", "cultivate". As to G/awama, the Malaboch call their Lekhuamen "the Headman or King" of the set, while in the Karanga tradition other names appear besides Kwami, which prove that among the latter the dice No 1 and No 2 have been mixed up. Its true and original notion among the Bushmen has been thoroughly discussed by Baumann (1936, pp. 10 ss., 20 s.). Among the Nama Hottentots Kub is used for "Lord"; the Huwu of the northern Bushmen bears unmistakable features of the Lord of animals. The Naron identify him with Khuba; Gaua is his younger brother and reveals himself in the storm, while Gauab is the Lord of lightning and thunder. The !Kung in Angola know the pair Huwe and //Gaua (or Nava) ; the latter has come from a hole in the ground and reveals himself in the thunderstorm; he is also the god of the hunters to whom they pray (Estermann, I, p. 31). All this indicates a connection with East African concepts of weather-, mountain-, and hunters' gods, like the Kube of the Nyamwezi (references in v. Sicard, 1966, p. 53). Baumann (1940, p. 79) has also pointed out that the originally integral Bushman culture had been mixed already before the arrival of the Proto-Hottentots and Bantu and that it was later divided by their neighbours in ''spheres of influence", the southern Bush- men having during this process to a large extent been "hottentotized". This leads us to a last consideration. In his description of N lodima Silberbauer mentions a feature which, at first sight, is rather surprising: Nfodima is believed to be "invulnerable". To my know- ledge, no special attention is called to this feature regarding any other African deity. One wonders, therefore, what Silberbauer's G/wi informants had in mind, when they stressed this point ? Now, there is the well-known Hottentot myth about the combat of Tsuni-Goam and Gaunab, which recounts how Gaunab before his death wounded Tsuni-Goam' s knee and how ever since Tsuni-Goam is limping. Baumann (1936, p. 13, 10) suggests a con- nection of this myth not only with a myth of the Masai, but also with T hora' s and Huwe' s struggle against Gauna among the Bushmen. Now then, Tsuni-Goam was wounded, and in this special case he must be regarded as an equivalent of G/awama. N lodima on the contrary was invulnerable! If this assumption is right, then G/awama will have to be connected also with Gurub, Guruva or Dorobo of the Hottentots and with the one-legged ancient weather-, fertility- and hunters' god Luwe and his many equivalents (v. Sicard 1966, p. 54:16). Furthermore, it should be noticed that exactly among the Masai the first man was called Dorobo (Hollis, p. 266 s.). I may also mention that the origin of Luwe is to be found in the Ancient Near East among the Hittites. Consequently we arrive at the following conclusions : 1. Both N lodima and G/awama have assimilated or retained features which were originally ascribed to weather deities and Lords of animals in the Ancient Near East. 2. They reached South Africa principally through East Africa. (The possibility of a secondary influence through the Sahara has not been discussed here.) 3. G/awama was the first to arrive. 4. N lodima did probably not come to South Africa before the arrival of the first Bantu waves, i. e. not before 500 A. D.</page><page sequence="3">Analecta et Additamenta 209 5. G/awama and NIodima had much in common. 6. In the four divination dice an adjustment between the manistically defined deity of the newcomers and the deity of the autochthons with its chthonical character- istics was attempted - a process which can be noticed everywhere in Africa south of the Sahara. 7. However, this dualism was hardly ever fully overcome. G/awama became the less powerful god and his equivalents became sometimes demiurges or even evil spirits. 8. Gusinde's assumption is confirmed so far as G/awama must be identified with I/Gauwa etc., and was displaced by NIodima. On the other hand, from a historical point of view, neither of them deserves to be styled a "highgod". BIBLIOGRAPHY Andersson, E. 1953 Contribution à l'ethnographie des Kuta.
