<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cyril of Alexandria: Select Letters. Edited and translated by Lionel R. Wickham. Clarendon Press, 1983. 226 pages. $55.00. Wickham's edition and translation of ten letters by Cyril of Alexandria, some never before published in English, is a welcome addition to the Oxford Early Chris- tian texts series. An erudite introduction places Cyril in his historical and theological context, highlights the issues raised in the letters, and describes the texts and manu- scripts on which the edition is based (the texts established by Eduard Schwartz in Acta Conciliorum Oecumenicorum I are used for the doctrinal letters). Two of Cyril's best-known epistles on Christology (epp. 2 and 3 to Nestorius) are supple- mented by less familiar ones. Perhaps the most interesting letters in the book are the "Answers to Tiberius" and the "Doctrinal Questions and Answers," which list Cyril's replies to questions on, for example, "anthropomorphism," the meaning of "the image of God," the possibility of eradicating fleshly sensuality in this life, the likeli- hood of the soul's progress in the afterlife, why Christians' cleansing from original sin is not transmitted to their children, and whether God can change past events. Pages of Greek text and English translation are conveniently printed to face each other. Indices of persons and of Biblical passages complete the volume. The translations are in readable modern English. Copious footnotes explain obscure points and list patristic documents and contemproary scholarship. Some may think Wick- ham an overly-enthusiastic partisan of Cyril (e.g., he labels Nestorius' picture of Christ "incredible"), but devotion to his subject does not detract from his fine edition and translation.
