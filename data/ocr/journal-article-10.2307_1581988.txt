<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DATE OF THE DE CATECHIZANDIS RUDIBUS BY L. J. VAN DER LOF In their edition of St Augustine's De catechizandis rudibus J. Farges and G. Combes express the opinion that this treatise was composed in the year 405.1 Their argument is as follows: "In the Retractationes St Augustine mentions this treatise between the Annotationes in lob and the De Trinitate. From this the Maurini, followed by Stilting, Schaenemann, Loofs and Rotmanner, inferred that it was written around the year 400, but Dom De Bruyne 2 is certainly right in pointing out that the De cat. rud. was placed by St Augustine a little after the De Actis contra Felicem Mani- chaeum and that the latter work dates from 404, so that the former was probably composed in 405. A second reason mentioned by De Bruyne is that, if the De cat. rud. had been written in 400, St Augustine would have composed seven or eight works in that year, including some very big ones, whereas he would have produced little between 400 and 410. This observation, too, is correct-even an author as active as St Augustine could hardly have written seven or eight works within twelve months, let alone nine, among which the Confessiones, consisting of 13 books, the Contra Faustum (33 books!), the Contra Epistulam Parmeniani (3 books), and the De baptismo contra Donatistas (7 books)." Besides quoting De Bruyne, Farges and Combes refer to M. Wundt, who defended the same view in a paper.3 Let us now examine the question whether it is really necessary to abandon the usual date of 399/400. First of all it may be useful to list the opinions of several specialists: 1 Oeuvres de Saint Augustin, vol.

Sizoo: 400 Ann. in lob - 400 De cat. rud. - 400-416 De Trin.8 As we see, most of these scholars put the De cat. rud. in 399; those who attribute it to 400, do so, because they date the De Trinitate differently. That this work was completed by the middle of 419 is evident from St Augustine's letter to Aurelius (Epist. 174) which he regarded as a prologue to the De Trin. and which dates from that time. The last three or four books of the De Trin. were written in the last two months of 418 and the first months of 419. St Augustine himself says that he finished this work at the instiga- tion of many brethren, and especially at the command of Aurelius, the bishop of Carthage (Epist. 174; Retract. II 15, 1). He tells this when speaking about his stay at Carthage in the summer of 418, where he met many bishops who stimulated him to complete his work after his return to Hippo.9 The beginning of the composition of the De Trin. may be dated in connection with the date of the De Actis contra Felicem Mani- chaeum. The Retractationes tell us that between the De Actis (mentioned in II 8) and the De Trin. (discussed in II 15) Augustine only wrote six small books, two of which were, moreover, completed 4 Saint Augustin et l'augustinisme (Paris s.d.), p. 183, 186. 5 Cf. for these data the index of St Augustine's writings in Joseph Barbel, Aurelius Augustinus, Enchiridion (Diisseldorf 1960), pp. 244/251. 6 Le date de composition du De Trinetate de saint Augustin, L'Annee theol. august. 12 (1952), pp. 305/16. 7 Bibliotheque augustinienne, vol.

VAN DER LOF from earlier notes. Since these six fairly small treatises cannot have taken much time, the beginning of the composition of the De Trin. cannot have been much later than the redaction of the De Actis. But on the datation of these Acta the dating of the De cat. rud. also depends, because it is one of the six works composed between the De Actis and the De Trin. Therewith the point at issue becomes: in which year did the discussion between St Augus- tine and Felix the Manichaean take place? 10 Farges and Combes suppose that the De Actis was composed in 404, and the same opinion is held by Cayre and Van Steenbergen 11 and by Sizoo.12 However, the last mentioned authors do not find in this a reason for putting the De cat. rud. in 405-in fact they date it to 400.13 It seems possible that this opinion was shared by De Bruyne: in the paper quoted above (cf. note 2) he does not speak about the De cat. rud. (so Farges and Combes wrongly refer to him), but he dates the Annotationes in lob about 401 and the De Actis to 404; in this train of thought he may just as well- indeed this argumentation is quite usual-have dated the De cat. rud. to 401 as to 405. Another question is whether the De Actis was written in 404. As it seems to me, we have every reason to think rather of 398 as the year of its composition. Here I adhere to the opinion of Paul Monceaux 14, who argues as follows: the disposition of the Retractationes is based on the historic order of St Augustine's writings, as the author explicitly states himself (Prolog. 3). In spite of this and of the fact that the text of this work has come down to us in a particularly good condition, we must assume that there is a mistake in the chronology for the following reason: in the Retractationes the Confessiones are mentioned as the sixth book written after St Augustine's consecration as a bishop; they stand 10 We know that the first disputation took place septimo idus Decembris (op. cit. I 1), the second pridie iduum Decembrium (ibid.

From these facts it follows that the De Actis must be earlier than 404, and therefore the text of the first sentence of this treatise as it is given by the manuscripts, viz., Honorio Augusto sextum consule, septimo idus Decembris (i.e., Dec. 7, A.D. 404) cannot be correct. It is for this reason that Monceaux proposes to read quartum instead of sextum; he supposes an original IIII to have been changed, first into III, and afterwards into VI. In this context it is important to note that several manuscripts of the Retractationes omit the number of the consulate altogether and that one of them gives the third consulate of Honorius, i.e., 396. If the De Actis was indeed composed during the Emperor's fourth consulate, i.e., in 398, it would belong -and this is a very strong argument in favour of Monceaux's hypothesis-to the period of St Augustine's controversy with the Manichaeans. So, if Monceaux's conjecture is correct-and we are strongly inclined to follow Hendrikx and Zarb in accepting it-, the main argument of Farges and Combes for dating the De cat. rud. to 405 has been refuted. We come now to a discussion of the second argument, viz., that, if the De cat. rud. was written in or about 400, one would have to assume that in that year St Augustine wrote a considerable number of treatises, whereas he produced very little between 400 and 410. In this connection it should be observed first of all that the editors quote De Bruyne incorrectly, when they say that he was speaking about the period between 400 and 410-De Bruyne speaks about 405-410.15 Now it should be noted that for the latter period a decline of St Augustine's productivity may well be explained by the fact that these very years saw the culminating-point of his struggle against Donatism and the beginning of his fight against Pelagianism. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the end of this period witnessed the sack of Rome which caused general despair-we 15 Op. cit., p. 303. 201</page><page sequence="5">L. J. VAN DER LOF need only refer to the famous utterance of St Jerome in the Preface to the first book of his commentary on Ezekiel (P.L. XXV, 15) and to the fact that it was the blame commonly put on the Christians which gave rise to the De Civitate Dei. In the second place it is by no means necessary to assume that in 400 St Augustine wrote no less than nine works, among them such lengthy ones as the Confessiones and the Contra Faustum. In this context we may refer to the dating of a number of the relevant treatises by other scholars: Marrou: Confess. 397; c. Faust. 397-398; c. epist. Parm. 400; De bapt. 401. Sciacca: as Marrou, only Confess. 397-400. Hendrikx: Confess. beginning of 397-398. Monceaux16: Confess. by the end of 397 or in the beginning of 398. From this it is clear that the year 400 would certainly not become "too full", and therewith the second argument put forward by Combes and Farges stands refuted. Some attention should also be given to the assertion (cf. p. 1 and n. 3) that Wundt in his paper Augustins Konfessionen took the side of De Bruyne and placed the De cat. rud. in 405. When we look up this paper, we find that, for the foundation of this opinion, Wundt refers to an earlier article 17 in which he simply sticks to the usual date of 404 for the De Actis and entirely ignores the possibility of a composition of this treatise in 398-he only expresses his regret that the date cannot be 396, the third consulate of Honorius, as is found in one manuscript of the Retractationes, because in that case one could at least maintain the order given in that work. The paper by Monceaux was clearly unknown to him. As observed already, we agree with Monceaux, and so we date the De Actis to 398 and consequently the De cat. rud. to 399. Therewith the latter work must be placed in the period of St Augustine's conflict with the Manichaeans. Wundt 18 acknowledges that the Confessiones are connected with that conflict, and in my 16 Op. cit., p. 53. 17 Zur Chronologie augustinischer Schriften, Zeitschr. f. d. neutest.

It is reasonable to assume that the dictum in veteri testamento est occultatio novi, in novo testamento est manifestatio veteris (De cat. rud. IV 8) is also directed against the Manichaeans. When he wrote this sentence, St Augustine had just finished his work Contra Faustum in which he had refuted their continuous ridiculizing of the contradictions between the Old and the New Testament. Further, the adherents of Mani used to point out the "anthropo- morphism" of Exodus, the decalogue and the resurrection of the body, the semi-pagan attitude of many Christians, etc. Now we find several passages in the De cat. rud. in which St Augustine evidently rather addresses the Manichaeans than the rudes.19 We give an enumeration of the most striking points: It is plausible that St Augustine was thinking of the theory of the Manichaeans that the principle of evil can injure the principle of what is right, when he wrote: itaque nec diabolus aliquid deo nocuit, quia vel ipse lapsus est vel hominem seduxit ad mortem.20 When he argues that the finger of God is the Spirit of God, he uses an allegory, and the allegorical method was a mighty weapon against the Manichaeans. They took the Old Testament entirely literally and it was on this account that they raised many objections to it.21 The words neque enim deus forma corporis definitus est are clearly aimed at the Manichaeans, who considered the Christian con- ception of God too anthropomorphic.22 About the ten commandments St Augustine says that they are in tabulis sane lapideis.23 He admits that the Law was given to Moses on tables of stone, but not to indicate a confinement under the Law. The point was to show the stubbornness of the Jewish people. Faustus with his Manichaean contradistinction between the Old and the New Testament contrasted 2 Cor. 3, 2 and Ex. 19 Cf. J. P.

Over against this St Augustine quotes Ezek. 11, 19: auferam eis cor lapideum et dabo eis cor magnum.24 Lastly St Augustine allegorizes about the sixth day of the Creation and the sixth period of the world. He does so both in De cat. rud. and in De Gen. c. Manichaeos.25 All these anti-Manichaean traces confirm our opinion that the De catechizandis rudibus was composed about 399 and that Combes and Farges are wrong in attributing it to the year 405.
