<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF THIE EUMENIDES OF AESCHYLUS IN the play of Aeschylus the problem before the first jury of the Areopagus was this. A man kills his mother at the order of a god, because she killed his father. Can he be held guilty for an act which racial custom demanded and a god sanctioned ? And yet, shall matricide go unpunished, or can that man claim to escape from the Erinyes, whose right and duty to avenge a mother is no less certain than a son's right and duty to avenge his father ? The jury could not make up their minds: their votes were equally divided. It is hardly easier for us to give a clear answer to the problem which puzzled those Athenians; and we have a further problem which they were spared-what did Aeschylus think ? on what grounds did he acquit Orestes ? what did he mean by his solution ? Editors and critics have answered these questions differently. Sidgwick holds that in the Eumenides 'the stage is lifted from earth to heaven : it is the powers of light, Apollo and Athena, who are active to protect the morally innocent against the powers of darkness, the Erinyes and the shade of Clytaem- nestra, who persecute the technically guilty. The lower view, that gailt lies in the deed, is embodied in the pursuing Furies, and here conflicts with the higher view that the innocent heart must be saved. ... The gods of light fight with the gods of darkness, and overcome.' Verrall's explanation is allied to this but more refined. He sees in the play the conflict of two Rights-of justice absolute and inexorable with the relative justice of a civic community-of the lex talionis with equity; and he sees in the reconcilement of the Eumenides a mysterious identification of Vengeance and Grace. This explanation is perhaps preferable to that of Sidgwick, who does not explain how powers of darkness can be suitable patronesses for Athens, and who ignores the irrefragable force of the Erinyes' plea and the plain statement of Athena :- oi, yap vevlK77a0O, aX ' iaXX rlo9 3l-c vX18' lXqo(0 01UK a t 'Ld o'Oev.1 But the philosophy seems a little modern for Aeschylus. What did he know of Grace ? Were these Rights and their conflict known to his political philosophy ? And there is a further and fatal objection to the views of both Sidgwick and Verrall. It is almost impossible for a modern not to give a fair-sounding explanation of an ancient play. He owes too much to the reputation of the dramatist and to our natural human instinct for edification. But do the facts bear out any 794-5. Here and elsewhere I quote from Sidgwick's text. 120</page><page sequence="2">THE PROBLEM OF THE EUMENIDES OF AESCHYLUS 121 such idealistic interpretations as -the above ? Does Aeschylus give reasons for the acquittal of Orestes that raise us from a world of primitive beliefs into a more spiritual universe ? Does he give any explanation of it at all ? It is a cardinal rule in dramatic criticism that a dramatist is not to be taken as preaching unless he preaches clearly. There is no doubt, for instance, when Euripides is attacking the gods or war, or when he is criticising the world's treatment of women. Is it clear here that Aeschylus is preaching a higher morality ? Look first at the gods involved. The only virtue of Apollo is loyalty to Orestes; and even here his client, while crediting him with a knowledge of the moral law, is not certain that he will practise it. ava? "ATroXXov otacOa 1Lev T To /1yJa&amp;KEv" e7ret ' E7-aT, KatTa 7o2) ' e ".Xtdv ua6e.2 All critics have noticed Apollo's deplorable bad manners. Wilamowitz says that 'he behaves like an arrogant Junker, too good to dispute with opponents of a lower rank of life,' and observes that the Erinyes display more self-control. Apollo's arguments are as bad as his manners. His plea (625 ff.) rests on three points. First, a son killing a mother is very different from a woman killing a 7evvaLoa dvn6p, a king. Second (657 ff.), there is no such thing as matricide; mothers are not mothers, but mere receptacles of the male-produced semen, as little connected with their husband as one stranger with another3 (660). If you doubt my science, remember the facts of Athena's birth, and you will be convinced (663 f.). Third (667), if you will acquit Orestes, I will make Athens great, and you will have the Argives on your side for ever and ever. Some of these arguments are crude fallacies; some appeal to prejudice and base self-interest: all show not merely a complete ignoratio elenchi, but an entire indifference to any such idealistic views, as Sidgwick and Verrall find in the play. Of justice, of grace, of equity, of higher spiritual conceptions, not a trace. Athena (whom Sidgwick oddly couples with Apollo, as though she were a praevaricatrix, not an independent judge) is better. She conducts the trial with courtesy and dignity. Her tact, moderation, self-control and persistence in the final debate with the Eumenides deserve their success and were an admirable model to her people. Yet she is not beyond reminding the Erinyes that if they are obstinate, she has access to the sealed chambers where thunder- bolts are kept (828). And her ground for acquitting Orestes is amazing : ~frifov 7' 'Op&amp;Ti 74v3' eY 7z7-poaOra-oIa /r11rqP ayp ovTtV ' oTv T' /1 yelvaTro.

W. LIVINGSTONE Again, nothing of justice, grace or 'the higher view that the innocent heart must be saved ' : only this; 'I, the president of the court, had no mother: therefore I am on the side of the male defendant against the female plaintiff.' As Wilamowitz says: Uns geniigt das nicht : vielleicht war Aeschylos seiner heimischen Gottin gegeni ber in naivem Glauben befangen. Ich glaube, er bequemte sich dem Glauben nur an, weil er eine zureichende Begriindung ihrer Abstimmung nichtfinden konnte. That indeed is giving the case away; but it fits the facts better than the theories of Sidgwick or Verrall. Verrall, it is true, attempts to save Athena's character in his well-known Praelection. ' The tremendous discords of the Agamemnon and the Choephoroe are not to be solved by methods of political compromise or legal procedure . No true reason, no argument founded on the nature of right, can be given for not punishing any more than punishing an act (like that of Orestes) of which the moral quality remains, after the fullest and best consideration, indeter- minate.' And so, to mark the impossibility of deciding which side is right, Athena gives her vote on no judicial grounds, which indeed do not here exist, but ' upon a casual preference, irrelevant to the merits ' of the case.5 This theory has all Verrall's fine, casuistic subtlety of analysis; but it seems to me, like most of his interpretations of Greek plays, to have more value as a suggestion to some future dramatist than as an explanation of the Greek original. Even if it be correct, it only rescues us from the least of our difficulties. If it explains the oddity of Athena's behaviour, it does not excuse the dis- honesty of Apollo's plea. If a case is made out for the Divine president of the court, none is made out for the Divine litigant. Verrall has attempted no justification here. And will his plea for Athena hold? I will only ask three questions in criticism of it. First, how many spectators of the Eumenides in the spring of 458 B.c. are likely to have put on the scene an interpretation which seems to have escaped every scholar of ancient and modern times before the year 1906 A.D. ? Second, if Aeschylus was propounding a solution which on the surface outrages our sense of justice, why did he not write at least a line of explanation which would have saved us from the outrage ? It may be taken as a canon of dramatic criticism-it is a canon which Verrall habitually ignored -that in important issues explanations which would not occur to an intelligent spectator of a play must not be accepted, unless there is any special reason why the dramatist should be obscure. Third, why should not Aeschylus have been able to find an adequate ground for the acquittal of Orestes ? It would have been quite easy to make it turn on some ideal and spiritual theory. Verrall and Sidgwick have each suggested grounds which Aeschylus might have used. But Aeschylus has not used them. There is no trace in the play of grace, pity, or a higher justice. There is nothing but the naked yet plausible and logical legalism of the Erinyes on one side; and on the other a sophistry and prejudice which are utterly implausible and illogical. God and the Erinyes state their respective cases to the court, and on the two statements of the case the Erinyes win hands down. It is plain that the poet here was not in an idealistic and spiritual mood. Aeschylus--it is part of his genius and his grandeur-had " Cambridge Praelections, pp. 84-85, 90.</page><page sequence="4">THE PROBLEM OF THE EUMENIDES OF AESCHYLUS 123 a foot in two worlds. He is a master of lofty theology; he is capable of the crudest anthropomorphism. The ZEV, ~a5-tsV nror' odaTiv passage of the Agamemnon is a good example of this. It opens with a subtle, half-agnostic profession of faith; then passing from religion to barbarism it ends with filial impiety and war in heaven. One can never be sure when opening a play of Aeschylus in which mood, in which world we shall find him. But there is no doubt about the first half of the Eumenides. Aeschylus here is in his primitive vein. Apollo's manners and arguments prove it. It is proved again by the allusion to Zeus' imprisonment of his father (641), and by the amazing but un- controverted statement of the Erinyes that Apollo when he raised Alcestis from death effected this breach of the uniformity of nature by making the Moirai drunk (728). And in the first two-thirds of the play there is not a trace of the ideal or the spiritual to counterbalance these disgusting legends. The theories of Sidgwick and Verrall are not tenable. Yet that of Wilamowitz is little better. Is it to be believed that Aeschylus ' could find no adequate grounds for Orestes' acquittal '? And that he botched up his play with a ground that is no ground at all ? That is only a degree more credible. Of course Aeschylus could have found a, dozen good reasons. But if so, why did he not find them ? That is the problem of the Eumenides. We shall advance a step towards its solution if we note that while the modern reader is interested in one problem, Aeschylus was interested in another. After reading the first two plays of the trilogy, we, and indeed all critics since the fifth century B.c., ask one question before any other :-will Orestes escape and how can he do it ? But this is not the question that interests Aeschylus; for him the axial centre of the play is elsewhere. The trial of Orestes is indeed essential to it. But he is forgotten when we reach its close. He leaves the stage nearly three hundred lines earlier, 'returning home ' to Argos (764), and significantly does not remain to share the final rejoicings. The dominating interest of the play for Aeschylus was not Orestes, but something else. That is why Aeschylus called the sequel to the madness of Orestes Euimenides, while Euripides entitled it Orestes. This eclipse of the nominal hero is one of the clues that guide to our answer. The emergence of the Erinyes is another. It is hardly dramatically defensible that these goddesses, the mere sight of whom 1000 lines earlier had deprived the priestess of the use of her legs, should when the play closes be welcome members of a festal procession. They snore (53), their breath smells and burns (134), their eyes produce a loathsome secretion (54), there are snakes in their hair. And yet before the play ends they are almost its heroines. Before it reaches its central point, their physical and moral peculiarities are forgotten. We see them only as the tenacious champions of an austere but impartial penal law, which they support in the interests of hnnan society, as a bulwark of o-cpoo-dvY (521, 530), justice (539), and healthy- mindedness (535), a defence against anarchy (525), impiety (534), and Hubris (534). From loathsome monsters of hell they have become patronesses in whom Athens may rejoice. And all this interest is introduced at the expense of logical coherence. The last 350 lines of the Eumenides are not an integral</page><page sequence="5">124 R. W. LIVINGSTONE part of the trilogy. They are a loosely connected episode, stitched on its outside.6 Why then did Aeschylus introduce them? and why did he write the play, so that at its close we have forgotten Agamemnon, Clytemnaestra and Orestes, and are thinking only of the Eumenides ? For the play closes without a reference to what is usually supposed to be its main subject; indeed from line 778 there is no allusion to it, except in so far as it concerns the anger of the Erinyes. This curious fact is not to be explained by saying that Aeschylus wished to glorify a local legend or to add a patch of local colour to his play. That could have been done in a few lines, as in the Oedipus Coloneus or in the Iphi- geneia in Tauris. There must have been some stronger reason why Aeschylus devoted a quarter of his play to the reconciliation of the Erinyes and allowed it to dominate and eclipse the acquittal of Orestes. There must have been some stronger motive to induce the poet to break his play's unity of subject. For some reason Aeschylus was particularly interested in the reconciliation. Every Athenian knew what that interest was when the chorus spoke the first two lines of the song that begins vPv KaTrao-rpobai ' v&amp;'v Oeot-leov (490). It was not the first time that the audience had heard those sentiments. The Eumenides was first acted in the spring of 458, shortly after the triumph of the democratic party, which had resulted in a breach with Sparta, an alliance with Argos, and the reforms that, depriving the Areopagus of its administrative and supervisory power and curtailing its judicial rights, left it a shadow of itself. The date of this revolution is now generally considered to be the autumn or late summer of 462 B.c. It was the decisive battle of the political struggle; hence- forward Athens was an unrestricted democracy. The political passions of the day are buried under the dust of time; but the ostracism of the leader of one party and the murder of the leader of the other bear witness to their violence. What was the attitude of Aeschylus to the reforms ? No doubt the critics are right who believe that he accepted them loyally. His own political ideals are clearly expressed in Athena's speech (690 f.). A moderate democracy, To lr47' avapXov /l7e T eao7'roTvlEVOV (696), which does not push reform to extremes (693) or go too far in banishing the terrors of restraining law (698). The only words that offer any difficulty to this interpretation are line 693.7 But they are vague and capable of the interpretation I have given them. The word Trniv in 693 8 seems to imply that Aeschylus acquiesces in the reform of the Areopagus, provided that its reform does not degenerate into its destruction. And those who believe that he took the conservative view must explain why he gives the Areopagus the functions which the democrats left it and gives it nothing more. Aeschylus makes the Areopagus a law court, not a council. Ephialtes reduced it from a council to a court. Aeschylus assigns it no other function than to try homicide, and represents it as instituted to settle a murder case. Trial of murder was the chief function which Ephialtes assigned it. Even 6 The play would be a finer work of art if Aeschylus had adopted the legend which Verrall argues was the original one, and had made the disappointed fiends return by a chasm in the earth to their infernal home (cf. Eur. El., 1270).

Is it likely that Aeschylus would have rejected the domestic policy of the democrats while supporting their not less momentous abandonment of Panhellenism ? Political eclectics were rare at Athens; and Aeschylus was not the man to be among them. The Eumenides then was written while the minds of all were filled, and the hearts of many sore, with the greatest domestic struggle that Athens was to know for sixty years. Allusions to it in the Eumenides have, of course, always been recognised. Apart from the prominence given by the play to the body that had recently been so prominent in Athenian politics, no reader could fail to see that the speech in which Athena founds the Areopagus and the prayers in which the Eumenides bless Athens were charged with meanings deeper than those on their surface. What I wish here to argue is that the contemporary allusions go far beyond these : that for more than half the play the battles of 462 B.c. are at least as much in the mind of Aeschylus and his audience as the story of Orestes : that in the discord of the two unreconciled rights of Apollo and the Erinyes the poet intends an allegory of a later struggle not less vehement and bitter between rights equally well-matched. Here we find the reason why Orestes disappears, why the reconciliation is allowed to break the unity of the play, why the Erinyes change from loathsome bugbears into austere, Calvinistic idealists, why the case for Orestes is rested on grounds perfunctory and even absurd. The reason is that for poet and audience the main interest was not the trial, but greater and more intimate issues. Major rerum nascitur ordo. Let me now try to work out this theory in detail. Aeschylus does not, of course, allow his moral to spoil his story. He is telling a traditional yi8ov, and he would not, indeed could not, distort that beyond recognition. Now in detail the 08oo, of Orestes and the struggle of democrats and conservatives do not correspond. Obviously Ephialtes was never hunted by Cimon nor tried before a tribunal. It is not the incidents of the story but their significance that are parallel. For each fact in a play or in life is two things : it is a bare incident in the world of phenomena, it is a meaning in the world of thought. So we shall look for parallelisms less when the poet is telling his story than when he is revealing its meaning : less in the narrative than in the comments, less in the speeches than in the choruses, where we see the incidents of the play not in themselves but as ideas with a spiritual signific- ance. The allegory, if it may be so called, commences at line 490. We should not expect it earlier. The pursuit and the 3u~otoov y ivo belong to the story of the play. It is when the Furies state their case that we become aware of the spiritual issues of the play: it is then that the thread becomes double, and the parallelism appears. Let me define a little further. I do not imply that Apollo represents the democrats, and that the Erinyes stand for the conservatives. There is no identity of persons here. But there is a similarity of situation. The parallel lies in the struggle of two Rights, the rejection of one, the heartburnings which</page><page sequence="7">126 R. W. LIVINGSTONE follow the rejection, and the reconciliation which unites the lately warring parties, not indeed in personal friendship, but in joint service to something outside and greater than themselves. The quarrel in the Eumenides has five acts:-an antithesis, a struggle, a decision, heartburnings, a reconciliation. The quarrel at Athens had had four acts, identical with the first four of these. Aeschylus wishes to urge on his countrymen a fifth act that would be identical too. The parallel is exact in general outline; I shall try to show how close it is in detail. The first words of the chorus strike the note which henceforward dominates the play : v v araao-poat v ov eo-~twov . . . 7rdraV ij&amp;rS 7 Tof' 'pyov eXepela o-vvaploo-et / poTrov'( (490 f.). It is the undying plea of conservatism in all ages-if you destroy the old order, you strike at the bases of society, the roots of morality, and posterity will suffer and bitterly regret your act. Lines 503-565 are variations on this single theme. The phrases may have been used, the sentiment must have been again and again repeated, in the debates which ended in the overthrow of the Areopagus. The Erinyes are ceasing to be the loathsome monsters of the play's opening: they are becoming representatives of justice and discipline. The gist of their argument throughout is that of the defenders of the Areopagus, who might have used every word in lines 503-543, except line 512, and every word in lines 549-565, without change of syllable or wrench of meaning.9 Is it credible that an audience, which had heard through a suc- cession of debates the old order defended with these familiar arguments, would see no analogy between the overthrow of the 7rdXaLot vo'ot and the revolution which had just taken place in their midst ? Indeed in certain of his phrases Aeschylus seems to have forgotten the Erinyes and to remember only his own S680/o .tK&amp;aS (516).

The phrases admirably describe and defend the Areopagus; they contain the actual word employed by Plutarch to describe its functions; 10 but pesv'Jv rWlo KoTroS is a wide term to apply to deities whose functions were very limited, - I quote in extenso the first of these passages. Let the reader suppose himself to have no clue to the meaning of these lines, and to know only that they contain a plea either for the Areopagus or for the functions of the Erinyes. Then let him read them and consider to which they seem most appropriate. He will, I be- lieve (if he ignores line 512), give his vote to the first of these alternatives. 7rEo'lErat 5" 'XAos ZAAXoOEv 7rpo.Pw vv ira 7rL 7TEaS KaKa/ I aX?sv U7r0/300iv -E WUX'XO( uKEc T OU?

'rTat : it is odd to describe the Erinyes as applying 'constraint,' but this is exactly what the unreformed Areopagus did. Again, the charge of ai~xpo1cp8ecta (541), though natural in Athenian debate, could hardly be brought against the jury of this play. There follows the debate and the ambiguous verdict. Here, in an iambic section, Aeschylus reverts to his story. He could do no otherwise; yet even here we can trace some contemporary influence. If the wish of Aeschylus was to plead for reconciliation at home by exhibiting a parallel struggle in the past, which now ended in reconciliation, he must hold the balance equal between the two parties. A peacemaker must be impartial: to make the victors win hands down would ruin his case by deplorable want of tact. So here neither side wins outright. The conservatives' arguments are as good as their opponents' plea, and they persuade half the jury. Yes, it may be replied, but the reason is aetiological: Aeschylus is giving a historical explanation of the Athenian custom of acquitting the criminal who won half the votes. Possibly. But it is less easy to see why Athena acquits Orestes, not on the arguments urged by Apollo, which she ignores, but for private and eccentric reasons of her own (736 f.). It is not usual for a judge to hear a case, pay no attention to the defence, yet discharge the defendant on grounds that have never been mentioned in the trial. I suggest that the significance is this. In the play Orestes and the Erinyes have each a strong case. It is put before an ideal human jury, who are equally divided as to which is right. The problem is referred to a deity, who settles it by an arbitrary decision. That is the lFolos. Aeschylus and his audience saw a political moral in this uzOos?. Aeschylus either believed in his heart, or in fact professed, that the conservatives and the reformers of 462 both had irrefragable arguments for their views, and that, if the question were put to a human jury, no decision would be reached. And then, if the conservatives asked him why, of two equal Rights, theirs should be the one to give way, he replies with what may be either a piece of mysticism or a political equivocation, but is certainly an appeal to patriotism. 'It is the will of Athena, of your own goddess. She gives no grounds intelligible to human reason. She never says that you are wrong and your opponents right. She simply declares her will:- LLOv 6o' ipyov, Xotruoav Icptval t&amp;~cqv (734). Accept as good Athenians the words of Our Lady of Athens.' This is at least plausible.

The Erinyes say what we should expect them to say; what no doubt the wilder spirits in the defeated at Athens must have said, unless this revolution was unlike all others in Greece. But what of Athena's reply ? Does it fit the original story alone ? or is it equally applicable to the politics of the time ? Is it the plea that an enlightened patriot would urge on oligarchs angry at the loss of privilege, seeing no future for them in the new democracy, and prepared to recover by blood what they had lost by a vote ? ' Do not take your defeat,' she says (794 f.), 'too hardly. It is no personal disgrace (795). Give up these threats of revenge (800 f.). You can live in Athens and enjoy (as Pericles and many another aristocrat were to enjoy) the honour of your fellow-citizens (807). If it comes to force, I have it at my command, but there is a better way of settling our differences (827-829).' Each of these arguments is punctuated by protests from the Erinyes. Athena's next speech (847-869) could be put verbatim on the lips of a contemporary of Aeschylus (except for line 860). 'You are the older generation and have more experience than I : yet wisdom is not confined to you (845-850). You may leave Athens, but you cannot help loving her 12 (851-852).

I have said enough to illustrate the exactness of the parallelism, and we have now arrived at a part of the play where contemporary allusion has always been recognised.

To sum up: in writing this play, Aeschylus was interested far less in Orestes than in the political issues of his own day. In the contest between the Erinyes and Apollo he saw an allegory of the contest of conservatives and democrats at Athens. He gave utterance through the mouth of his chorus to the feelings, arguments and threats of the defeated party; he put up their own goddess Athena to plead for reconciliation; and he brought his play to an issue in which the rivals sink their private differences in a common loyalty. It was because he was interested in this rather than in Orestes that he based the acquittal on grounds very lame in themselves, though harmonising admirably with the purpose which he had in hand. Is this really the meaning of Aeschylus ? We cannot here apply such tests as would be ready to our hand if we possessed an account of the fall of the Areopagus, giving details of the struggle and of the actual arguments of the combatants. That might reveal allusions in the play which now escape us.13 Meanwhile the argument from probability seems overwhelming. I know the objections to novel interpretations of Greek plays, unknown to Alexandrian commentators and to later scholars. But such an interpretation if ever justifiable is justified here. For if the play contained a contemporary moral, the key to it would be lost within at most a generation. Political struggles are quickly forgotten. How many remember to-day the fierce battles over education and 'Chinese Labour' which overthrew the Conservative Government in 1906 ? 'Passive resisters' are barely a memory with the present generation. And the rapid developments of fifth-century Athens must soon have overlaid the fall of the Areopagus, still more the veiled allusions to it in this play, so that within thirty years men would have read it as we read it. It is remarkable that the scholia do not notice even the obvious references to contemporary events which all scholars admit. It is therefore 13 Thus 796-797 may refer to a contemporary inquiry from Delphi. J.H.S.-VOL. XLV. K</page><page sequence="11">130 R. W. LIVINGSTONE not surprising if references less immediately on the surface should escape scholars to whom issues, living to Aeschylus, were dead and buried. And after all the issues are there. No one asserts that the prominence of the Areopagus in the play or the concluding denunciation of civil war is acci- dental. I only suggest that they are present in places where they have hitherto been overlooked, and that Aeschylus, writing in a profoundly disturbed political milieu and with an allegory to his hand which conveyed lessons suitable to the situation and congenial to himself, did not refrain from using it. Indeed the ordinary view of the play is highly implausible. For if there are any con- temporary allusions in the play, there would inevitably be more than it admits. If Aeschylus had been content with a mere glorification of the origin of the Areopagus, he would have misled his audience; for, as we have seen, he accepted the reforms. His own views as well as the interests of his country demanded that he should go farther, offer some remedy for the present dis- contents, and convert the Erinyes of his own day into Eumenides. So much for external probability. When we turn to the internal evidence, to the play itself, we find an exact analogy to the contemporary situation : a contest, and the very arguments which the defenders of the Areopagus must have used; a defeat, and the threat that must have followed their defeat; an appeal from personal disappointment to a common patriotism; a reconciliation such as we know to have followed, and which bore its fruits at Tanagra. Further, we find lines-I need not recur to them-which hardly apply to the Erinyes and to the Gi0Oo0 of the drama, but which admirably suit the Athens of 458. These are facts. It is, of course, possible to deny the inter- pretation here placed on them. In this case we must suppose that the central interest of the Eumenides for Aeschylus was the problem of Orestes' acquittal, and that though it was the central interest, he could find no better reasons for the acquittal than he gives; in fact, that the climax of his trilogy is badly botched. We must suppose that though the fortunes of Orestes are the real subject of the play, Aeschylus thought it suitable that we should hear nothing of his hero after line 777, that for 270 lines a new interest should occupy our minds, and that the closing scene of the play should contain no allusion to him. Finally, we must suppose that, though whole speeches of the Eumenides and of Athena could be placed totidem verbis on the lips of the disputants of con- temporary Athens, this was wholly unintentional, and passed unobserved by the poet and by the most quick-witted audience that has ever listened to a play. We may suppose all this. But those whose intellectual digestion is less excellent will see in the play a parallel to the Persae. Only, whereas the politics are openly avowed in the Persae, here (though audible enough) they are a sous- entendu. It could not be otherwise: common sense, ordinary tact, did not allow the poet to speak aloud. In the Persae he was exhibiting to a united people a triumph in which they all had a share. Here he was administering certain medicinal suggestions to a defeated party. They could not be palatable, though he knew them to be wholesome. If they were presented without a decent if transparent disguise, they would be rejected from the first. So he did what every doctor does. He made them up in a pill. Pills do not</page><page sequence="12">THE PROBLEM OF THE EUMENIDES OF AESCHYLUS 131 deceive us; but their rounded and agreeable surface enables us to take drugs which in their naked state we should refuse. So we are to see in this play, as in the Persae, first and foremost a topical drama. Neither play is the worse for that. For in both a great poet has taken a contemporary event, purified it of the accidents of the hour, viewed it sub specie aeternitatis, and shown the world how, under the transitory emotions of a political struggle, to trace issues and principles that never pass.'4 R. W. LIVINGSTONE. 14 It may be argued that if the Areopagus lost its powers in 462 B.C., allusions to it in a play acted three and a half years later would fall flat. The conclusive answer to this objection is that allusions to it are present in any case. And naturally. The ground- swell of political revolution long outlasts the original storm. In our own nation, so calm, so callous in accepting accom- plished facts, the agitations that led to the Reform Bill disturbed, if they did not convulse, England for many years after 1832. And the Athenian was not calm and compromising, but emotional and in- transigent. Indeed the opening of the archonship to the Zeugitae,. which closes the first phase of fifth-century democratic reform, was carried in the very year of the Oresteia. NOTE TO J.H.S. XLIV., P. 281.
