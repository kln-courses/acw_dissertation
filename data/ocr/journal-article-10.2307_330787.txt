<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scientific Theory in Erasmus Darwin's The Botanic Garden (1789-91) By CLARK EMERY NE ordinarily thinks of poetry and science as being two mutually ex- clusive fields of endeavor. I. A. RICHARDS, for example, is inclined to feel that science has a definite contraceptive effect upon the creation of poetry.1 In the eighteenth century, however, the poets themselves had no such fears. To the contrary, they fell with delight upon scientific discoveries of the most diverse sorts and adapted them to poetical uses. RICHARD BLACKMORE'S Creation, for instance, discusses, among other things, NEWTON'S theory of gravitation, the systems of PTOLEMY, COPERNI- CUS, TYCHO BRAHE, and KEPLER, the vegetable kingdom, various atomic theories, agriculture, disease, and ends with a physiological study of the veins, arteries, nutrition, nerves, and animal spirits. A few lines from this last section will give some idea of the method: The salient point, so first is call'd the heart, Shap'd and suspended with amazing art, By turns dilated, and by turns compress'd, Expels and entertains the purple guest; It sends from out its left contracted side Into th' arterial tubes its vital pride; Which tube, prolong'd but little from its source, Part its wide trunk, and takes a double course. One channel to the head its way directs, One to th' inferior limbs its path inflects ...2 Other poets went into equal detail in their poetical versions of the discov- eries made by astronomers, physicists, geologists, physiologists, botanists, et al. But perhaps the crowning achievement of the century among scientifico- verse-compendiums was The Botanic Garden by ERASMUS DARWIN, himself both poet and scientist. It is with an idea of indicating the extent to which scientific material enters into his poem that this paper originates. 1 Cf. Science and Poetry (New York, 1926) p. 58. 2 Book VI. Cf. for an analogous passage BROOKE'S Universal Beauty, Bk. IV, and a poem in The Gentle- man's Magazine (1737), VII, 246, which, having discussed the anatomy of the eye, muscles, lungs, heart, and so forth, refers to the stomach as the "aliment-retaining bag," says that the gall-bladder "come last in song," and concludes conventionally that the animal economy is a "stupendous work of heaven's almighty hand!"</page><page sequence="2">Clark Emery DARWIN was a man of wide interests. As a young graduate of Cambridge with a Bachelor of Medicine degree, he settled for a short time as a physician in Nottingham. He had no patients and therefore ample time to write to a friend on various subjects, including mechanics and medicine and "the wild- est speculations ... on the resemblance between the action of the human soul and that of electricity .. ."3 He experimented, too, with shorthand, having filled six volumes with shorthand notes while still a young man.4 In 1757 he addressed, through Mr. WILLIAM WATSON'S kind intermediacy, two letters to the Royal Society.5 His introductory note to Mr. WATSON was properly modest: The inclosed papers were designed for the perusal of the Royal Society; being an en- deavor to confute the opinion of Mr. EELES about the ascent of vapours, published in the last volume of the Transactions. But the author, having no electrical friend, whose sagacity he could confide in, has at length prevailed upon himself to be so free as to send them to Dr. WATSON; to whom the world is so much indebted for the advancement of their knowledge in electricity. Whence, Sir, if you should think, that these papers have truth, the great Diana of real philosophers, to patronize them, you will confer a favour upon me, by laying them before that learned Body. If, on the contrary, you should deem this confutation trifling or futil, I hope you will be humane enough to suppress them, and give me your objections; and by that means lay a still greater obligation on one, who has not the pleasure to be personally acquainted with you.6 In 1784 he was influential in forming a Philosophical Society in Derby.7 At the first meeting he delivered an address in which were these sentences: As we are fashioned and constituted by the niggard hand of Nature with such imperfect and contracted faculties, with so few and such imperfect senses; while the bodies, which sur- round us, are indued with infinite variety of properties; with attractions, repulsions, gravita- tions, exhalations, polarities, minuteness, irresistance, etc., which are not cognizable by our dull organs of sense, or not adapted to them; what are we to do? shall we sit down contented with ignorance, and after we have procured our food, sleep away our time like the inhabitants of the woods and pastures? No, certainly!-since there is another way by which we may indirectly become acquainted with those properties of bodies, which escape our senses; and that is by observing and registering their effects upon each other. This is the tree of knowledge, whose fruit forbidden to the brute creation has been plucked by the daring hand of experi- mental philosophy.8 In this speech he showed the same faculty for combining metaphor and scientific material that later was to characterize his The Botanic Garden. DARWIN did not by any means confine his interests to pure science. Throughout his life he showed a DA VINcI-like penchant for mechanical in- vention. Among the products of his inventive genius were a new kind of 3 ERNEST KRAUSE, Erasmus Darwin (New York, 1880) p. 17. 4 Ibid., p. 17. 5 Philosophical Transactions (1757) p. 240. 6 Loc. cit. 7 KRAUSE, op. cit., p. 55. 8 Loc. cit. 316</page><page sequence="3">Scientific Theory in Darwin's The Botanic Garden carriage,9 a speaking machine,10 a horizontal windmill for grinding flints,1l a rotary pump, and a canal lock. HESKETH PEARSON, his biographer, ob- serves that: His Commonplace Book is full of ideas and sketches for lamps, candlesticks with telescope- stands, knitting-looms, weighing and surveying machines, water-closets, and what-not. He noted down that "a machine to measure the quantity of air passing from North to South or from South to North is not impossible to construct"-and he promptly drew a diagram. His fancy played around the subject of visible or luminous music; fogs and frosts engaged his keen attention; his mind jumped from electricity to wooden chessmen, from a double-furrow plough to an artificial bird, from perpetual motion to diving bells, from vegetation to evaporation.12 He was, then, a man of broad knowledge, active, analytical mind, keen observation, and unusual foresight; even when he adopted an unscientific methodology, he did it for the ultimate advancement of science. His Apology for The Botanic Garden opens with these words: It may be proper here to apologize for many of the subsequent conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy, as not being supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experi- ments. Extravagant theories however in those parts of philosophy, where our knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their use; as they encourage the execution of laborious experi- ments, or the investigation of ingenious deductions, to confirm or refute them. And since natural objects are allied to each other by many affinities, every kind of theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge by developing some of their analogies.13 The Botanic Garden is cast in two parts, the first entitled "The Economy of Vegetation" and the second "The Loves of the Plants."'14 The first part is composed of four cantos, each devoted to an address by the Goddess of Botany to one of the four elements. In the first canto appear the Nymphs of Fire; in the second, the Gnomes of Earth; in the third, the Aquatic Nymphs; and in the fourth, the Sylphs of the Air.15 His machinery gave him a splendid opportunity to introduce a wide variety of scientific material, 9 ANNA SEWARD has an amusing account of his experience with this invention, which she calls" this whimsical carriage." 10 It "pronounced the p, b, m, and vowel a, with so great nicety as to deceive all who heard it unseen, when it pronounced the words mama, papa, map, and pam; and it has a most plaintive tone, when the lips were gradually closed." Quoted from Temple of Nature, notes, p. 120, in KRAUSE, op. cit., pp. 120-21. 11 This was constructed for and successfully used by JOSIAH WEDGWOOD. 12 HESKETH PEARSON, Doctor Darwin (London, 1930) pp. 30-31. 13 The Botanic Garden (London, 1791) p. 7. 14 "The scenery is taken from a botanic garden about a mile from Lichfield, where a cold bath was erected by Sir JOHN FLOYER. There is a grotto surrounded by projecting rocks, from the edges of which trickles a perpetual shower of water; and it is here represented as adapted to love-scenes, as being thence a proper residence for the modern Goddess of Botany, and the easier to introduce the next poem on the Loves of the Plants according to the system of LINNAEUS." (Note to Canto I, 1. 26, p. 3.) 15 In the Apology, he writes: "The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and Salamanders, was thought to afford a proper machinery for a Botanic Poem; as it is probable, that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures representing the elements." 317</page><page sequence="4">318 Clark Emery which was, of course, his primary purpose. For example, the very first words which the Goddess speaks- Nymphs of Primeval Fire! your vestal train Hung with gold-tresses o'er the vast inane-16 require a footnote elucidating the nature of fire: The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the most extensive element in nature; all other bodies are immersed in it, and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by the at- traction of their particles to the matter of heat.... 1 The explanation continues at length and includes cross-references to other notes to other verses. In quick succession follow notes of which single sen- tences will give an idea: 1. The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion: since these have evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes, the decomposition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials . . . 18 2. Mr. HERSCHEL has given a very sublime and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his discovery of some thousand nebulae, or clouds of stars; many of which are much larger collections of stars, than all those put together, which are visible to our naked eyes, added to those which form the galaxy, or milky zone, which surrounds us ... 19 3. The meteors called shooting stars, the lightening, the rainbow, and the clouds, are phenomena of the lower regions of the atmosphere . . . 20 4. Mr. CAVENDISH has shewn, that the gas called inflammable air, is at least ten times lighter than common air; Mr. LAVOISIER contends, that it is one of the component parts of water, and is by him called hydrogene . . . 21 5. The crepuscular atmosphere, or the region where the light of the sun ceases to be re- fracted to us, is estimated by philosophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high, at which time the sun is about 18 degrees below the horizon; and the rarity of the air is supposed to be from 4,000 to 10,000 times greater than at the surface of the earth.

I, p. 10. 21 Ibid., p. 11. The poetic lines are directed to the Ethereal Powers: Or, plum'd with flame, in gay battalions spring To brighter regions borne on broader wing, Where lighter gases, circumfused on high, Form the vast concave of exterior sky. 22 Bk.

In- terspersed among the material which he paraphrases or reduces from the written experiments of HERSCHEL, PRIESTLEY, LAVOISIER, and many others (including Dr. DARWIN), are brief but often pithy semi-philosophical com- ments. Of gunpowder he says: There is a bitter invective in Don Quixote against the inventors of gunpowder, as it levels the strong with the weak, the knight cased in steel with the naked shepherd, those who have been trained to the sword with those who are totally unskilful in the use of it; and throws down all the splendid distinctions of mankind. These very reasons ought to have been urged to shew, that the discovery of gunpowder has been of public utility by weakening the tyranny of the few over the many.32 In a note referent to a line with the words "Feast without blood," he writes: "The benevolence of the great Author of all things is greatly manifest in the sum of his works, as Dr. BALGUY has well evinced in his pamphlet on Divine Benevolence asserted . . . 33 DARWIN explains that the nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources: the milk of the mother; seeds or eggs; and the destruction of living animals. The first, he says, gives pleas- ure to both mother and offspring; the second gives pleasure to the consumer and no pain to the consumee; but the third would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of nature than those before mentioned, "as contributing less to the sum of general happiness."33 Like earlier optimists of the century, he is able to assert a place in the scheme of things even for a volcano: As these Volcanos are supposed to be spiracula or breathing holes to the great subterraneous fires, it is probable that the escape of elastic vapours from them is the cause, that the earth- quakes of modern days are of such small extent compared to those of antient times, of which vestiges remain in every part of the world, and on this account may be said not only to be innocuous, but useful.35 23 Ibid., p. 14. 24 Ibid., p. 16. 25 Ibid., p. 17. 26 Ibid., p. 19. 27 Ibid., p. 22. 28 Ibid., p. 23. 29 Ibid., pp. 24-25. 30 Ibid., p. 26. 31 Ibid., p. 37. 32 Bk.

EDWARD YOUNG has some interesting lines on the invention of gunpowder in his The Foreign Address (1734): See yon cowl'd Friar in his cell, With sulphur, flame, and crucible; And can the charms of gold that saint inspire?

But the footnote probes the old story for hidden factual meanings: Other stories of Hercules are perhaps of later date, and appear to be allegorical, as his con- quering the river-god Achelous, and bringing Cerberus up to the day-light; the former might refer to his turning the course of a river, and draining a morass, and the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times.36 Liberally footnoted as the canto is, DARWIN found it necessary to insert dissertations at the end on the following subjects: 1. Meteors. 2. Primary Colours. 3. Coloured Clouds. 4. Comets. 5. Sun's Rays. 6. Central Fires (fires within the earth). 7. Elementary Heat. 8.

The second canto is equally a compendium of scientific information-as are the third and fourth.37 For purposes of convenience, I will simply list the more important subjects which enter into these three cantos and merit DARWIN'S annotation: Canto II 1. Lunar and solar volcanoes. 2. The formation of the earth as a result of a solar explosion. 3. The moon's atmosphere, and its probable lack of inhabitants. 4. The origin of limestone rocks from shells. 5. Salts produced from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies. 6. "Nitrous air" and "azotic gas or phlogistic air." 7. The formation of iron ores. 8.

The second half of the poem, "The Loves of the Plants," is much more limited. The poem sets out to demonstrate LINNAEUS' system of botany, which is explained in the preface as follows: LINNEUS has divided the vegetable world into 24 Classes; these Classes into about 120 Orders; these Orders contain about 2,000 Families or Genera; and these Families about 20,000 Species ... The Classes are distinguished from each other ... by the number, situation, adhesion, or reciprocal proportion of the males in each flower. The Orders, in many of these Classes, are distinguished by the number, or other circumstances, of the females ... The first eleven Classes include the plants, in whose flowers both the sexes reside; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither united, nor unequal in height when at maturity; and are therefore distinguished from each other simply by the number of males in each flower ... 38 The first eleven classes, then, are named according to the number of sta- mens in each flower. Thus Class I (One Male, Monandria) includes the plants which possess but one stamen.39 The ten following classes add a stamen each; thereafter the situation is complicated by "the reciprocal proportion in re- spect to height" of the stamens; their adhesion, "either by their anthers, or filaments, or to the female or pistil"; and other such matters of interest only to a specialist. In the poem DARWIN proposes to make a poetic classification of various plants. He explains first that " . .. the name or number of the Class or Order of each plant is printed in italics; as 'Two brother swains.' 'One House contains them' .. "40 For example: Two brother swains, of Collin's gentle name, The same their features, and their forms the same, With rival love for fair Collinia sigh, Knit the dark brow, and roll the unsteady eye. With sweet concern the pitying beauty mourns, And sooths with smiles the jealous pair by turns.41 This is explained in the note: Two males one female. I have lately observed a very singular circumstance in this flower; the two males stand widely diverging from each other, and the female bends herself into contact first with one of them, and after some time leaves this and applies herself to the other.42 The elements of a drawing-room problem play appear in the description of Turmeric: 38 "The Loves of the Plants," p. I. 39 Ibid., p. II. 40 Ibid., p. V. 41 Ibid., p. 5. 42 Ibid., p. 5.</page><page sequence="9">Scientific Theory in Darwin's The Botanic Garden Woo'd with long care, Curcuma, cold and shy, Meets her fond husband with averted eye: Four beardless youths the obdurate beauty move With soft attentions of Platonic love.43 The rather embarrassing situation is made clear: One male and one female inhabit this flower; but there are besides four imperfect males, or filaments without anthers upon them, called by LINNEUS eunuchs.44 Such ludicrous anthropomorphism could not fail of satire, although for a time the poem enjoyed a great success.45 His grandson, commenting that in his time no one was reading a single line of it, attributes the sudden reversal of public opinion in part to CANNING'S popular parody, the Loves of the Triangles. The first half of DARWIN'S poem seems, since the author has more scope, less ridiculous. His method is simple: the Goddess addressing the Sylphs of the Air, for example, merely tells them what they are in the habit of doing, and then for poetic effect draws an analogy: Sylphs! You, retiring to sequester'd bowers, Where oft your PRIESTLEY woos your airy powers, On noiseless step or quivering pinions glide, As sits the Sage with Science by his side; To his charm'd eye in gay undress appear, Or pour your secrets on his raptured ear. How nitrous Gas from iron ingots driven Drinks with red lips the purest breath of heaven; How, while Conserva from its tender hair Gives in bright bubbles empyrean air, The crystal floods phlogistic ores calcine, And the pure Ether marries with the mine.46 This passage alludes to the following experiments: 1. Concerning the production of nitrous gas from dissolving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid . . . 2. Concerning the green substance which grows at the bottom of reservoirs of water, which Dr. PRIESTLEY discovered to yield much pure air when the sun shone on it. 3. Concerning the great quantity of pure air contained in the calces of metals.... 47 Thus modern learning is carefully taken care of. But classical learning has its place as well. It follows the lines quoted above to exemplify them: So in Sicilia's ever-blooming shade, When playful Proserpine from Ceres stray'd . . . 48 DARWIN uses the method with almost mechanical regularity. The Rosicru- cian mechanism, too, permits numerous grotesqueries. There is something 43 Ibid., p. 7. 44 Loc. cit. 45 Cf.

There is another element which gives the poem distinction. Since this, its anticipation of evolutionary theory, has been discussed before, I shall touch upon it only briefly. Early in "The Economy of Vegetation" he writes that: From having observed the gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed; and afterwards its successive advances to its more perfect state, or maturity; philoso- phers of all ages seem to have imagined, that the great world itself had likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity ... .. He gives the philosophic imagination empirical basis: The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our view in mines or moun- tains, countenances this opinion; since these have evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes, the decomposition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials, and must therefore have been formed progressively from small beginnings. There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete appendages to plants and animals, which seem to shew they have gradually undergone changes from their original state . . . 52 He concludes, after listing several varieties of such changes, that: . . perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of Nature are remains of their habits of pro- duction in their former less perfect state, or attempts towards greater perfection.53 In his discussion of turmeric he observes that: There is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which have two wings, or diptera, analogous to the rudiments of stamens above described; viz. two little knobs are found placed each on a stalk or peduncle, generally under a little arched scale; which appear to be rudiments of hinder wings . . . Other animals have marks of having in a long process of time undergone changes in some parts of their bodies, which may have been effected to ac- comodate them to new ways of procuring their food. The existence of teats on the breasts of male animals, and which are generally replete with a thin kind of milk at their nativity, is a wonderful instance of this kind. Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection? an idea countenanced by the modern discoveries and deductions concern- ing the progressive formation of the solid parts of the terraqueous globe, and consonant to the dignity of the Creator of all things.54 In another passage in "The Economy of Vegetation" he asks certain suggestive questions that a member of the earlier Chain of Being school would have heard with horror: "Were all the ammoniae destroyed when the continents were raised? Or do some genera of animals perish by the increas- 49 Canto III, 11. 405 ff. 50 Canto IV, 11. 365-80. Immediately after this comparison is an exhortation to the "connubial fair" to nurse their children in person. 51 Canto I, p. 8. 62 Ibid., p. 8. 53 Loc. cit. 54 "The Loves of the Plants," Canto I, pp. 7-8.</page><page sequence="11">Scientific Theory in Darwin's The Botanic Garden ing power of their enemies? Or do they still reside at inaccessible depths in the sea? Or do some animals change their forms gradually and become new genera?"55 Obviously, the one satisfactory answer among them for earlier philosophers would have been the third. In the Zoonomia is a sketch of a theory of evolution which set forth prin- ciples which anticipated LAMARCK'S Philosophie Zoologique by fifteen years: When we revolve in our minds, first, the great changes, which we see naturally produced in animals after their nativity, as in the production of the butterfly . . . from the crawling cater- pillar . . . Secondly, when we think over the great changes introduced into various animals by arti- ficial or accidental cultivation ... Thirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced in the species of animals before their nativity ... When we consider all these changes of animal form, and innumerable others, which may be collected from the books of natural history; we cannot but be convinced, that the fetus or embryon is formed by apposition of new parts, and not by distention of a primordial nest of germs included one within another like the cups of a conjurer. Fourthly, when we revolve in our minds the great similarity of structure which obtains in all the warm-blooded animals, as well as quadrupeds, birds, and amphibious animals, as in mankind. ... Fifthly, from their first rudiment, or primordium, to the termination of their lives, all animals undergo perpetual transformations, which are in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and aversions, of their pleasures and pains, or of irritations, or of associations; and many of these acquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity.56 It may be the case that science and poetry are incompatible, that the ascendancy of the former will mean the ultimate extinction of the latter. Whether or not this unhappy eventuality occurs, it is to be hoped that DARWIN'S poem will not be altogether forgotten. He did not wed the two, for if there is science in the poem there is little poetry. But he made a mighty effort. Indiana University 55 Canto III, p. 120. LAMARCK wrote in his Zoological Philosophy: "I am still doubtful whether the means adopted by nature to ensure the preservation of the species or races have been so inadequate that entire races are now extinct or lost. "Yet the fossil remains that we find buried in the soil in so many different places show us the remains of a multitude of different animals which have existed, and among which are found only a very small number of which we now know any living analogues exactly alike. "Does this fact really furnish any grounds for inferring that the species which we find in the fossil state, and of which no living individual completely similar is known to us, no longer exist in nature? There are many parts of the earth's surface to which we never have penetrated, many others that men capable of observing have merely passed through, and many others again, like the various parts of the sea-bottom, in which we have few means of discovering the animals living there. The species that we do not know might well remain hidden in these various places." J. B. LAMARCK, Zoological Philosophy, tr.
