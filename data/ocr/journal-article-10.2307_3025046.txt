<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. By CHARLES BRAY. "All our conceptions are based on the implied postulate, that the world is as it appears. . . . The advance of knowledge consists in the substitution of accurate conceptions for natural ones."--Man and his Dwelling-place, by James Hinton. "WHEN the person wha is spoken to dinna ken what the person wha speaks means, and when the person wha speaks dinna ken what he means himsel, that's metaphysics." This well-known definition is probably as true now as when it was first given. The main cause of its truth, as it seems to me, first lies in the want of common terms, and consequent disputes are thus not only unintelligible, but do not in all cases resemble "the communion of saints." The words soul and body, mind and spirit, knowing and being, matter and force, substance and properties, cause and effect, noumenon and phenomenon, condi- tioned and unconditioned, are all used in a different sense. And this is not surprising, as the object of the inquiry is to determine what these terms really do mean, and what is the sense that ought to be put upon them. In metaphysics each disputant has his own language, and all controversy ought to begin by mastering each other's dic- tionary. I propose to begin at the very beginning, and then to see if modern science has thrown any light on this subject. Hume says, " We may observe that it is universally allowed by philosophers, and is, besides, pretty obvious of itself, that nothing is ever really present with the mind but its perceptions, or impressions, and ideas, and that external objects become known to us only by those perceptions they occasion. Now, since nothing is ever present to the mind but perception, and since all ideas are derived from something antecedent to the mind, it follows that it is impossible for us so much as to conceive or form an idea of anything specifically different from ideas and impressions. Let us fix our ideas out of ourselves as much as possible; let us chase our imaginations to the heavens, or to the utmost limit of the universe, we never really advance a step beyond 392</page><page sequence="2">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 393 ourselves, nor can perceive any kind of existence but those perceptions which have appeared in that narrow compass." This, however true, and, as Hume says, now " universally allowed by philosophers," is not, how7ever, true to common apprehension, which still believes in an external world, exactly as it appears, and knows nothing of consciousness, ancl that the objects of knowledge are in reality not things, but ideas. But if, as Hume says, " external objects become known to us only by those perceptions they occasion", then we ought to be consistent in our inductions and deductions from this fact, and not attempt to raise whole systems on supposed knowledge beyond. Our owm consciousness is all that is known to us, and all else is only more or less probable inference. Every external fact re- quires to be translated into the language of our thoughts. The longest chain of physical causation necessarily has its last link in the mind. The bridge to be built, or the road to be travelled, is not from physics to metaphysics, but from metaphysics to physics. The ego produces the non-ego. This, as I have said, is not the common appre? hension : no doubt the first question is, What is the world without % The next, What am I ] and thus on reflection w7e come to consider the medium or instrument by which the world becomes known to us, and which we call the mind, but which in reality is merely our conscious? ness. We ask, then, what is this consciousness % Whence comes it, or what is the cause of it 1 and lastly, What is the good of it?what is the use of it?what is the object of it 1 Here we have the ques? tions of being or existence, of efficient cause or final cause, all questions of pure metaphysics, all requiring to be answered before physics can be properly pursued; for as w7e know of an external world only through the medium of our consciousness, how do we know that it tells us truly, or to what extent its indications may be trusted ? What, then, is consciousness ? It is a succession of varied feelings and ideas, and this only; differing greatly in intensity. We call this variety of sentience by the names of propensity, sentiment, sensa? tion, ideas, perception, conception, memory, imagination, and judg? ment. We speak of ideas and feelings passing though the mind, but there is no evidence of their passing through anything. The aggre- gate of these ideas and feelings are the mind, ancl there is nothing else. Consciousness is supposed to be a general term denoting states of mind, but mind has no existence in itself, but consists of these " states", or stream, or succession of thoughts and feelings. Con? sciousness, and sentience or feeling, in one sense are the same, but what is generally meant by the term is the action of one faculty upon another, that is, reflection on consciousness. With Dr. T. Brown and James Mill, to have a feeling, and to be conscious of that feeling, is</page><page sequence="3">394 anthropological review. the same thing, and this may be said to be the case with animals generally, who have feelings, but do not attend to them; but with J. S. Mill, it is one thing to have a feeling, and another to recognise and reflect upon it, and refer it to one's-self, and to the series that make up our sentient existence. Self-consciousness, however, is when another intuitional feeling besides reflection is associated with the train of thought. This induces us to refer all our states to the "I," or self, and is an element in our belief in personality. But what do we know of consciousness 1 Being conscious and know- ing are the same things. Consciousness in its several states of thought and feeling, of pleasure and pain, is the only real and absolute know? ledge we have ; all else is relative. Metaphysics we know, physics we know only in the relation to metaphysics, and as the facts and laws of physics are translated into ideas, the language of our consciousness. Phenomena and their laws are known to us but as parts of our con? sciousness. Much is said about observation and facts as opposed to mere thought in apparent forgetfulness of this truth, that every fact must become a thought before we can know it. But whence comes this consciousness ? What is the cause of it ? The common answer is, that it is the action of the soul or of the mind ; but we do not find either soul or mind in our con? sciousness, and that is all of which we have any knowledge ; that is, if there is anything more than the succession of our consciousness, soul, or mind or spirit, consciousness does not belong to it. We find, however, a body, and that body has a brain, and pressure on that brain puts a stop to consciousness at once, and on further inquiry we find that whatever affects the brain affects our consciousness, and conse? quently we are obliged to come to the conclusion that there is a direct and immediate connection between them. Upon this philosophers are pretty well agreed, but as regards the nature of the connection there is at present very little agreement, if, indeed, there is any definite opinion at all. " If there is one thing clear about the progress of modern science," says Professor Huxley, " it is the tendency to reduce all scientific problems, except those that are purely mathematical, to problems of molecular physics?that is to say, to the attractions, repulsions, motions, and co-ordination of the ultimate particles of matter. Social phenomena are the results of the interaction of the components of society, or men, with one another and the surrounding universe. But, in the language of physical science, which, by the nature of the case is materialistic, the actions of men, so far as they are recognisable by science, are the results of molecular changes in the matter of which they are composed; and, in the long run, these must come into the hands of the physicist."* Professor Tyndall * " The Scientific Aspects of Positivism."?Fortnightly Revieiv, June, 1869.</page><page sequence="4">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 395 says: " 1 hardly imagine that any profound scientific thinker, who has reflected upon the subject, exists who would not admit the ex? treme probability of the hypothesis, that for every act of conscious? ness, whether in the domain of sense, of thought, or of emotion, a certain definite molecular condition is set up in the brain ; that this relation of physics to consciousness is invariable, so that, given the state of the brain, the corresponding thought or feeling might be in- ferred; or given the thought or feeling, the corresponding state of the brain might be inferred."* From this acknowledged fact the erroneous conclusion is often drawn that thought is a phenomenon, or mode of action, of the brain, but although consciousness is con? nected with molecular motion in the brain, yet that motion does not constitute it, but is something separate and distinct, and which may be exhibited apart from that motion. As Professor Tyndall says, " molecular forces determine the form only which the solar energy will assume." When we say that thought is a function of the brain, we do not mean that it is the motion of the brain, but the power of the brain; that is, it is with the cause of the motion, and not the motion itself that we have to deal. Motion is nothing in itself, that is, no entity; it is merely the transference of substance or entity from one point in space to another; it is the cause of this, or agent, with concerns us, and this we call Force. To say that motion is a condition of matter, and that one body conditions another, is no explanation, for it still leaves unexplained how does it condition it % Let us take a simple illustration. A grind- stone is set in motion, and we are told that the movement is some? thing distinct from the grindstone, and that there is nothing more real than "movement." Real,?but no-thing, i. e., no entity; but how can a thing be real which is no-thing, i. e., nothing] A moving grindstone is simply a grindstone moving, as distinguished from a grindstone at rest; it is simply the same grindstone in another or altered condition. Motion is mere change of place, and adds nothing, and takes nothing away from a body; but the cause of the motion does. When the grindstone was set in motion, something was added to it which is indestructible, and the motion is simply the indication of its presence. It is no part of the grindstone, and may be passed on, the grindstone simply determining the mode in which it is passed on. This something we call force. But whence was it derived ? If the stone was set in motion by the hand, the force came from the food, which came from the sun; if by steam, from the coal, which again came from the sun; if from falling water, again from the sun which lifted the water. This force is a measureable quantity ; it is measured by its ability, or by what it can do. It is the same with ' Opening Address at Norwich," 1868.</page><page sequence="5">396 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. the function, or power, or force of the brain. It is derived from the food, and after passing through various rnanipulations which inten? sity it, it enters the brain, producing what is called its molecular mo? tion, and passing on as consciousness, as special thought and feeling, and each thought and feeling consuming an amount of force in pro? portion to its intensity. This thought or feeling is not a power of the brain, the force only j)asses through, the brain conditions it, or turns it into thought or feeling. Thus Herbert Spencer says truly, " That no idea or feeling arises, save as a result of some physical force expended in producing it, is fast becoming a common-place of science; and whoever truly weighs the evidence will see that nothing but an overwhelming bias in favour of a preconceived theory can explain its non-acceptance" ; and Dr. Hemy Maudsley says, " Mind is the highest development of force, and to its existence all the lower natural forces are indisj^ensably prerequisite."* Dr. Tyndall, however, says, "The passage from the pl^sics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness, is unthinkable." Of course that which we believe to be the unconscious force of the brain, can never think how it is it begins to think, is true enough; but in reality we have no such pas? sage to make. Consciousness is all w7e know, or can know*, and we cannot know, therefore, of anything differing from it; ancl we may reasonably object, therefore, to any argument based upon any sup? posed difference between mental and physical force, and to such terms as " physical" forces, and lower " natural forces", when they are made to imply a difference in essence, of which we can know nothing.t It is probable that there is no unconscious force, as I shall endea? vour to show7, and we are certainly not justified in affirming positively that there is, as conscious force in all we know. Dr. Biichner says, " It is by the brain that we ascend from matter to mind." Now, the force that becomes conscious in the brain is not matter, but what is usually called spirit. There is no instance in which we can be said to ascend from matter to mind. There is the transmitted vital spark, and the forces that bring it into activity. Dr. Tyndall truly says, " Given the state of the brain, the corresponding thought or feeling * The Physiology and Pathology of the Mind, p. 60. f Hume says, " We have no perfect idea of anything, but a perception. A substance is entirely different from a perception, We have therefore, no idea of a substance. Inhesion in something is supposed to be requisite to support the existence of our perceptions. Nothing appears requisite to sup? port the existence of our perceptions. We have, therefore, no idea of inhe? sion. What possibility, then, of answering the question, Whether perceptions inhere in a material or immaterial substance, when we do not so much as un? derstand the meaning of the question ?"?A Treatise of Human Nature, vol. i, p. 311.</page><page sequence="6">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 397 may be inferred," and vice versd. It is founcl that our varied con? sciousness of thought and feeling is connected with different parts of the brain, with intensity proportioned to the size and structure of the part, and to the extra force thereby employed. Let us take a less simple illustration of our meaning than the one I have given of the grindstone. Let us take a kaleidoscope. With each turn we get a new form. Now, what is the result. Let us never forget that force is indestructible; now, what force is there, and what has become of it 1 The force required for the turning of the instrument has pro? bably passed into surrounding objects, " the form"?the phenomenon, the appearance?the result of the action, passes away never to return, but the force that gave rise to it, or that underlies it, is still in ex? istence. Where? Certain waves of ether, or force, strike upon the glass, and producing a reaction of 477 millions of millions of waves upon the retina in a second, set the brain in motion, and produce the sensation which we call red; other parts of the glass produce 577 millions of millions in a second, producing the sensation of green, and 699 millions of millions produce violet, &amp;c. Colour, then, is a sensation or idea, in the object it is a reactionary force, which passing through millions of millions of waves, becomes a sensation of red, green, or violet. But what then becomes of it ? It is still a force, and a force that can produce 699 millions of millions of wave motions in a second must be a very strong one. This force, then, first sets other portions of the brain in motion, which gives us ideas of form, size, position, &amp;c, for we cannot think of colour apart from extension and figure, or of more than one figure without the idea of relative position, and it is from this mental state we derive our idea of space ; and in this way a few simple forces received through our five senses from without, by the aid of the cunning machinery of the brain, are created into a whole world which we rather foolishly believe to have a real existence independently of the sensations, ideas, and feelings of which it is composed. This sensation of colour, as we perceive, is within us, and not attached to the object, as most people believe ; it is correlated or transformed force, reflected from, and modified by the object; some objects in which we can perceive no more difference than in bits of glass producing some millions of millions of vibrations more than others. As we started by affirming, the sensation, as a part of our consciousness, is all we know, and, as Hume says, " we can never really advance a step beyond", for what possible resemblance can a sensation of colour have to the motion of the brain, or to the waves of ether, or to the reflected force from the object that caused those waves, and which is the only relation between the object and the sensation 1 It is impossible, then, that in any sense we can know things them- VOL. VII.?NO. XXVII. E E</page><page sequence="7">398 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. selves, for we never come near them; there is always a long chain of antecedent and consequent between ; the action of the brain, the action of the sense, the action of the atmosphere or the ether upon that, and the action of the object upon them ; and how, therefore, the object affects the atmosphere or ether, and through them us, is all we know, or can know: i.e., all the knowledge we can attain of things with- out our consciousness of the non-ego, is simply how they affect, not us even, but other things a long way off. The world is created by a correlation of forces in the brain, which forces are received in different quantities, and are variously modified before they reach the brain, and the study of these quantities and modifications, which we call pheno? mena and their laws, and which are known to us only as they are further changed and form part of our consciousness, is science. Mind, then, is correlated force : a few simple impressions are received through the senses, which are worked up by the complicated machinery of the brain into what we intuitively believe to be the world without us. A real worlcl without consciousness would be the same as no world at all; ancl a world existing only in our consciousness is quite as good as if it had objective reality, and requires quite as much wisdom and power in its creation. But what is Force 1 It is time we answered that question. Force is everything. It is known to us only as the ability or power to pro? duce certain changes ; but by force I mean the entity to which this ability or power belongs, from which it is no more separable than motion from the thing moving. It is not motion, but the cause of motion. It is not the action, but the agent. Deceived by appear? ance, we erroneously suppose force to result from the action of matter, whereas the action of matter in all cases is the result of force. We think the power is in the motion, but motion is merely the sign of the presence of the force. In the instance we have given, the grindstone, its working force seems to be in the motion, but the free force has been transmitted to the grindstone, and as soon as that has been used up, that is, has passed on, its grinding power and motion cease. To say in this case that the force results from the action of matter, is a delusion of the senses?a vulgar error. It is altogether illogical; it is confounding the entity with its mode of action?the cause with the effect, the phenomenon with the noumenon, the motion with the thing moving. It is equally an error to confound the action or molecular motion of the brain with thought. The brain, like the grindstone, simply passes the force, or mental power, on in the peculiar condition known to us as consciousness ; the force is not the creation or the re? sult of the action of the brain; it existed before it entered the brain, and it exists afterwards. We are told that " to suppose mental phe-</page><page sequence="8">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 399 nomena to be anything but phenomena is nonsense"; the nonsense must be in the supposition that phenomena are separablefromnoumena, or motion from the thing moving. We are told that " force viewed separately from matter is nothing": this is merely a repetition of the same error, and is only true in one sense, viz., that force cannot be viewed separately from itself, for matter is force. " The phenomenon called matter arises from two forces, the one acting towards, and the other from a point or centre".* The existence of matter is based upon its supposed extension and solidity, but extension is an idea insepa- rable, as we have seen, from the sensation of colour, and solidity is in the same way based upon the sense of feeling, and that is mere repul- sion?resistance to motion. J. S. Mill says, "when the question arises whether something that affects our senses in a peculiar way is, or is not matter, what seems always to be meant is, does it offer any, however trifling, resistance to motion?" In fact, solidity is a mere mental hypo? thesis invented in order to explain resistance. Huxley says, " every form is force visible; a form of rest is a balance of forces ; a form undergoing change is the predominance of one over others." Science now reduces all things to " the attractions, repulsions, mo- tions, and co-ordination of the ultimate particles of matter;" but these ultimate particles of matter?molecules and atoms, are the unknown quantities, the x, y, of certain forces,?they are creatures of the ima? gination, and as pure assumptions as the spirits of the spiritualists. If force viewed separately from matter is nothing, what is it fills the interstices between these supposed atoms ? Sir Isaac Newton supposed that all these atoms in our globe, if they could be brought together, would not occupy the space of a square inch; what, then, is the rest? in fact, what is compressibility? What draws the needle to the magnet ? What fills the space between star and star, and draws each to the other? What draws the waters of the ocean to the moon? Is it the moon, at 240,000 miles away, or something that really exists between and unites the two ? It is true that force may not be evident to our senses, except through its connection with what we call matter; but we mean by force the principle of action, the unseen cause of all change or motion, and as everything is in motion, so force is the uni? versal interpenetrating medium throughout the universe. The forces at present known to us we call heat, light, electricity, galvanism, chemical affinity, attraction, and repulsion,?these, in their modes of action and manifestations, produce half the phenomena around us; the forces of life and mind produce the other half. These forces are indestructible and persistent, and as they pass readily into each other, we reasonably infer that they are in reality only one and the same The Philosophy of Theism, p. 73. EE2</page><page sequence="9">400 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. force. But force, ancl cause, and the ability to produce a change, are the same thing: but a cause implies two things,?power or ability, and direction or determination * for every change has a purpose, a direction towards a definite object, and the force then includes both power and intelligence. This is not necessarily conscious intelligence. It may very reasonably be asked, wdiat is unconscious intelligence 1 In automatic action we have the power, ancl all the effects of intelli? gence, where consciousness has ceased to attend it. We know nothing of mind in its essence, and can judge only by analogy as to its mode of action; and if, therefore, we may judge of universal mind by the small glimmer that appears in our own consciousness, we find con? scious action constantly passing by repetition into unconscious; what at first requires a separate ancl distinct volition, goes on now w7ithout. Secondary Cause, or Natural Law, is thus simply automatic action of Universal Mind. That wdiich originally required a distinct con? scious volition, has passed, in the ages, into the fixed order of nature. We have thus intelligent action without consciousness or volition.* There is no bridge, then, from physics to metaphysics,?there is no * Moleschott tells us very positively that " Force is not an impelling god, not an essence separate from the material substratnm of things. A force not united to matter, but floating freely above it, is an idle conception. Nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus, possess their inherent qualities from eternity." Now, since Faraday's time, philosophers have agreed to drop this " material substratum of things", but admit that nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc, show certain definite and deter- minate forces, certain likes and antipathies; the much higher probability is that their definite action, to fulfil determinate ends, was once the result of conscious volition, now become automatic. " Qualities are eternal, inalien- able, and untransferable," says Dubois-Reymond; and Dr. Buchner says, " it seems incomprehensible how so simple and necessary a conception as that of the eternity of the world could ever have been lost to the mind." Now, instead of this being a simple and necessary conception, it is an im? possible conception : our consciousness tells us nothing of the eternal; and in point of fact, there is no more reason to believe that the world was eternal, or without origin, than organic beings; and we know they began to be. Again, Dubois-Reymond tells us that " matter is not like a carriage to which the forces, like horses, can be put and again removed from." Now, we have seen, in the instance I have given, that the forces were put to the grindstone and again removed from it. Force is in no case a mere property of matter; it is received from without and passes on. A body at rest will continue at rest for ever, until the horses are put on, i. e., until external force is applied to it; or, to put this first law of motion shortly, all forces will continue in un vary ing action until other force is applied to them. " Every giving off of forces has, for its necessary effect, the storing up of force in equal amount elsewhere;" or, as Faraday puts it, " what disappears in one place must reappear in another." It must, therefore, have a separate existence. Buchner says," all the so-called imponderables, such as light,</page><page sequence="10">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 401 road that way ; the only way is from metaphysics to physics; for all force is mental force, such " will-power" as we are conscious of exer- cising in our small individuality. Universal Mind passes into un? conscious action in general law, and again becomes conscious in the brain of percipient beings, in brains so modified that each sentient existence has its own special world, created by the correlation of the same external force in its own brain and nervous system. " The old specidations of philosophy, which cut the ground from materialism by showing how little we know of matter, are now being daily rein- forced by the subtle analysis of the physiologist, the chemist, and the electrician. Under that analysis, matter dissolves and disappears, surviving only as the phenomena of force; which again is seen con- verging along all its lines to some common centre, sloping through darkness up to God."* Berkeley denied the existence of an external world, and declared that our perceptions were mere ideas evoked in the mind by Deity; and we find that each brain creates its own world by the correlation of force from without, and as its consciousness is modified by its own structure. But force or power without cannot be separated from that of which it is the force or power,?that is, of Deity. Dr. Thomas Brown holds that the entity that has this ability is this ability; and Spinoza says, " God's power is the same as his essence"; and thus all heat, electricity, magnetism, etc, are neither more nor less than changes in the aggregate state of matter,?changes which, almost like contagion, are transmitted from body to body." The imponderables, he says, are changes, that is, motion, and he commits the common error of confounding motion with its cause. It is with that which " almost like contagion is transmitted from body to body" with which we have to do, and which, if it were not a something in itself, could not be so transmitted. He also says, " Nothing but the changes which we perceive in matter, by means of our senses, could ever give us any notion as to the existence of powers which we qualify by the name of force. Any knowledge of them by other means is impossible." This may be very true ; but that is no reason why we should confound the mere sign with the thing signified,?the changes with their cause. Again, he tells us, " No real naturalist doubts that forces are but qualities, or mo? tions of matter." Now, motion is a condition, but qualities are forces or powers; as J. S. Mill says, "What we term the properties of an object are the powers it exerts of producing sensations in our consciousness." With respect to these " changes" by which force is manifest to us, Mr. R. T. Wyld says : " Were force freed from this connexion (with physical body), it would attain immediate equilibrium, and the physical universe would instantly cease to exist,?action and reaction, momentum and inertia, resistance and localised force being at end, physical law and the physical world would be at an end with them; for the physical world consists but of the antagonism of contending forces."?On Free An-atomic and Tro.nsmissible Power. * The Reign of Law. By the Duke of Argyll.</page><page sequence="11">402 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. manifestations are manifestations of the one Supreme Power, and all change " the varied God." Berkeley, in denying the existence of an external world, did not deny that there was nothing external; he ad? mitted God's power, both conscious and automatic. Let us now consider what the bearing of these principles is upon certain physio-metaphysical questions of long standing. " Locke had shown that all our knowledge was dependent upon experience. Berkeley had shown that we had no experience of an external world independent of perception; nor could we have any such experience. He pronounced matter to be a figment. Hume took up the line where Berkeley had east it, and flung it once more into the deep sea, endeavouring to fathom the mysteries of being. Probing deeper in the direction Berkeley had taken, he found not only was matter a figment, mind was a figment also. If the occult substratum, which men had inferred to explain material phenomena, could be denied, because not founded on experience; so also, said Hume, must we deny the occult substratum (mind) which men have inferred to ex? plain mental phenomena. . . . Matter is but a collection of impres? sions. Mind is but a succession of impressions and ideas."* This was felt to be unanswerable; but then it was not to be judged by its truth, but by its supposed consequences; it led to scepticism, what? ever that may be, and the efforts of almost all metaphysicians since have been directed to the evasion of this truth. Lewes says, " Re? mark, also, that Hume's scepticism, though it reduces philosophy to a singular dilemma, viz., that of either refuting his sceptical argu? ments, or of declaring itself and its pretensions to be vain and base- less, nevertheless, affects in no other way the ordinary judgments or actions of mankind. t Now, the only dilemma to which philosophy was reduced was, that it had found a truth that it did not then know how to use ; but if, instead of being frightened, we had allowed it " to affect our ordinary judgments and actions", it would have placed mental science on the same firm basis of induction as physical. We now know that " no idea or feeling arises, save as the result of some jjhysical force expended in producing it;" that each idea and feeling is a separate correlation of force, and that the mind is merely, as Hume says, a succession of those ideas and feelings. There is but one entity in the universe, which Spinoza called Substance ancl phy- sicists call Force. Mind is force, matter is force ; consciousness tells us nothing of their essence, but they are the same in their manifesta? tions and obey the same laws. The strongest force prevails equally in the mind as in the world without. The will is but the trigger that lets off this force in the direction of the obiect aimed at. The * Lewes's Biographical History of Philosophy, p. 481. f Idem.</page><page sequence="12">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 403 strength of the mental force is in proportion to the size of the organ through which it passes on its road to consciousness. But mind is not a mode of action or motion?it is an entity itself; it is so much force, which is indestructible ; it may change its form, but cannot cease to be. Each thought and feeling is a separate, inde? pendent, indestructible existence. Mind, however, has no existence apart from these thoughts and feelings. It is not mind, then, that is indestructible, but these thoughts and feelings. Hume says, " 'Tis still true, that every distinct perception, wrhich enters into the com? position of the mind, is a distinct existence, and is different, and distinguishable, and separable from every other perception, either contemporary or successive." The question is, what becomes of those "distinct existences"1 Our own ideas of the world?our thoughts and feelings?are supposed to exist only in the percipient, in the "ego,"but the force of which the ideas are composed existed separately from the "ego," and may, indeed must, do so again. That this mental, or voluntary, or will power, is in great part again converted into physical force, as heat and muscular motion, there can be no doubt." We have, as Mr. B. S. Wyld says, " a direct experience that the amount of physical power obtained is, cceteris paribus, in con? stant proportion to the amount of the mental effort which we are con? scious of exerting in producing this physical powrer. "* Certain narcotics and stimulants act directly upon the mind, greatly intensifying its action, and these immediately show themselves again in the expression of the eye, and in every muscle of the body. Tobacco suspends mental activity; opium and hashish greatly increase it. A snake, as often tried by experiment, when sluggish, and only just awake, takes half- an-hour to kill its prey; but when excited and made angry its venom kills instantly. Illustrations of the direct connection between mental and physical force are everywhere around us, only little attention has yet been called to them. The torpedo strikes its prey at a distance of Some feet. Here is mental force, or voluntary will power acting at a distance through the medium of the water; and Professor Owen tells us that the amseba draws its prey towards it as rubbed amber draws light substances. The mesmerist by voluntary effort can act upon others at great distance, through what medium he does not at present know, or whether any medium is required other than the all- pervading force around. Still the force that passes into consciousness in the brain is at present by no means sufficiently accounted for. I know that it is the orthodox opinion among men of science that " thought cannot exist without brain;" but this proposition, I hold, is by no means * Paper read before the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh, ?

Thought is not a motion of the brain, or a mere mode of action at all, for " it is force which causes the movement, and not the movement which causes the force"; and it must exist as force after the movement of the brain ceases, and why not as mental or conscious force ? And if so, the question is what becomes of it ? This inquiry becomes deejjly interesting when at the jjresent time we have many scientific men declaring that they recognise, in so called spiritual ma? nifestations, both power and intelligence apart from brain. What is "thought reading"? it cannot be a mere recognition of the action of the brain. I have seen the number on three watches, consisting of five figures each, told successively by a mesmerised child, when they coidd be read only in the mind of the operator: for until there was light enough for him to see they could not be told by the child. There could be no possible doubt about this case, and at present we have no means of explaining it. Here we have a separate and distinct " form" of figures, not a mere action of the brain, recognised by one person in the mind of another. A perception or idea then is a positive entity ; and again, I say, what becomes of all those ideas that pass through the brain ? Do they retain consciousness or merely possess the power to create the same ideas in others? Are they packed up somewhere in the brain for future use? or have we souls made of them? As the body is made of protoplasms, or infinitely small vital cells, so may our spiritual body be made up of these thoughts and feelings. I am told that Mr. C. F. Varley, the electrician, who sees ghosts, thinks that all the thoughts of our lives make up the body of the spirits. If a single drop of water may contain five hundred millions of animalcules?living creatures, and that these " have organs of loco- motion, the mode of which leaves no doubt that they each possess sensation and will, and that consequently they must have organs and tissues accordingly," there must be plenty of room to pack any amount of ideas in the brain. Professor Owen, in the last volume On the Anatomy of Vertebrates, summing up his general conclusions, says, "Life is a sound expressing the sum of living phenomena." " These phenomena are modes of force." " Into these modes of force other modes of force have passed from potential to active states." Nerve force and electric force are con- vertible; and, asks the Professor, "may there not be conversion of force, magnetic, electric, thermotic, nervous ? Is not thought to the brain what electricity is to the battery ? Nerve force rises from reflex acts to volitional acts : the quiver of the pricked muscle to the resolve to write a book. With the size and complexity of the brain centres, from Aztecs to Europeans, correspond the intellect and will." The Professor, subsequently, writing about what he calls " thought-force," says, " if lines of thought-force were visible, the ghost (of Samuel) would not</page><page sequence="14">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 405 therefore be more material." May, then, thought-force ever become visible 1 It is evident Professor Owen does not think it impossible. Does what is called by spiritualists, a " medium," supply the con? ditions?* If consciousness or thought, as Professor Owen says, " is to the brain what electricity is to the battery," no one believes that electricity ccases to exist when discharged from the battery, and yet the positive school of physicists always reason as if thought being discharged ceased to exist. Thus Dr. Louis Buchner, in Matter and Force, says, " The brain is, then, only the carrier and the source, or rather the sole cause of the spirit, or thought; but not the organ that secretes it. It pro- duces something which is not materially permanent, but which con- sumes itself in the moment of its production." How the brain can be merely the carrier of that of which it is the source or sole cause, or how something consumes itself is not clear, but this passage fur- nishes a pretty fair sample of the Doctor's ordinary style of reasoning. The force that works the body is derived from the food, and is originally derived from the sun, in the divorce of the carbon from the oxygen in plants; and as " nerve force and electric force are con- vertible," no doubt we are sensibly alive to the electric states around us. Temperature does not affect us as it does the thermometer, but according to the electric condition of the atmosphere. We often feel colder with the thermometer at 50? than at 40?. The Spectator (July 3, 1869), speaking of the intimate relation between the sun's spots and perturbations and the magnetic currents of our own earth, says, " Could we really establish any periodic law of electric excitement on the earth, it would not be irrational, but in the hignest degree rational, to expect marked human phenomena in connection with it? either a great concurrent depression or a great concurrent stimulus to the energies of the human brain.In point of fact, it is by no means impossible that the issues of peace or war, of a financial crisis, or a religious agitation, may be closely bound up with these pheno? mena." * A Mr. Munder of Boston, now of 630, Broadway, New York, was put upon his trial last spring for obtaining money upon the false pretence of taking spirit photographs. The trial lasted four days and he was acquitted, as his brother photographers, after every facility offered to them for investi? gation, had failed to detect any imposition. The New York Sun of February 26, 1869, reports the case at considerable length. The reporter to this paper says he watched the process from beginning to end. After various sittings, with various results, always taking care that the glass was well cleaned and polished, " he thought he would try the effect of calling to his mind the ap? pearance of his father, as he looked just before he died, some eleven years ago. This time the negative gave a face in profile rather dim, but in general outline, he must confess, very like his father, as he thought of him."</page><page sequence="15">406 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. The force supplied to our organism is a definite quantity, and it has to work the whole machine; people who spend much time out of doors are ordinarily not great thinkers, and thinking and digesting cannot go actively on together, but the most important vital process is the putting in the new material to replace the old and worn out, and while this is going on the force to the brain is turned off and consciousness ceases in what we call sleep.* Dreaming is the consequence of the partial supply of force to the brain, some parts of it being thus brought into activity while others are asleep. The greatest incongruity in thought and feeling is the consequence, and yet the world of our dreams is quite as real to us as that of our waking hours. Sometimes, the force being absent from other parts of the brain, is supplied in unusual quantities to the intellectual faculties, and there is greater intellectual vigour than when awake. Having seen, then, Whence comes Consciousness, we have now to in- quire, What is the object of it? This brings us face to face with final cause, and the question is, Do we know anything, or can we know anything of final cause? The Athenceum, in its review of Prof. Owen (July 17, 1869), says, "long ago philosophers have proved both final causes, and innate ideas, and tendencies to be mere assumptions." Dr. Biichner says "the motion of matter is as eternal as matter itself. Why matter assumed a definite motion at a definite time is as yet unknown to us;" but if matter ever began to move towards any defi? nite aim, this is admitting voluntary action and intelligence, which I think the Doctor denies. The question then is what was the object when matter began to move towards the production of organised beings ? Is it as the Doctor says unknown to us ? A world without consciousness is practically non-existent?the same as no world at all. The production of consciousness, then, is more desirable than the pro? duction of a world, but consciousness that was merely cognizant and took no interest would be no better than none at all; it must be either pleasurable or painful. Now no one desires a painful conscious? ness, and a pleasurable consciousness therefore is the only desirable * Mr. Charles Moore, in an Essay " On Going to Sleep," brings together, from different quarters, various facts which appear to him to justify the con? clusion that a contraction of the cerebral arteries, shutting off to some extent the supply of blood to the brain, is the physical occasion of sleep ; this con? traction being due to the unimpeded energy of the sympathetic ganglia which comes into play when the inhibitory action of the brain upon them is withdrawn. He conjectures, also, that states of somnambulism and double consciousness may be produced by the separate contraction of particular arteries, the area of the brain dependent upon other arteries not being asleep.</page><page sequence="16">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 407 end in the production of sensitive organised creatures. This is the final cause ; this is " why matter assumed a definite motion at a definite time," and things are right or wrong as they tend towards this object, that is, towards pleasurable consciousness. Alphonso the Wise of Castile constructed the Alphonsine Tables on the Ptolemaic hypothesis, that the sun went round the earth, then universally received, but he suspected there was something wrong, and ventured to suggest that if the Creator had consulted him, he should have recommended a solar system far more simple and beautiful?with the sun in the centre, etc. So theologians now make man the centre of their system, making everything to revolve round him, and when they find things do not square with this hypothesis, they think it a very bungling contrivance, and make another world on the pattern of what they think this ought to have been if it had not been spoilt. The " plan" is evidently to produce the largest amount of pleasurable sensation, and not to flatter man's pride as the lord of creation; he is but a small part of a much larger system, even on this planet, and is moved by the same law7s as all the rest of the sensitive creation, and, what? ever he may think, he makes rather a ridiculous figure strutting about in his borrowed plumes, regardless of the w7ires or natural laws by which he is pulled, and at present in utter ignorance even of their existence. The world was inhabited hundreds of thousands of years before he came upon it, and at this time there is a whole Ocean world, and world within world besides, of sensitive existences in which he can take no part: a fly with its hundred eyes sees things differently to us, and fortunately its tastes, particularly its gustative ones, are different to ours. The world, as we conceive of it, is not a reality; each creature creates its own world and carries it about in its own head; outside itself there is nothing but the play of forces on the nervous centres of each being. This creates a thousand worlds adapted to the different wants of each, and is so much better, therefore, than if it had objective reality; and man stupidly thinks it was all made for him, and that the way these forces affect him is the absolute measure of truth: whereas a very few only of the forces around him reach him through his five senses or otherwise, and produce those impressions and ideas which are sufficient to guide him towards the objects of his being, towards his real world?that of his pleasures and pains, and which he calls his moral world. In reality he knows very little in? deed of all that is going on without him, as he is cognizant only of the influences that can penetrate through his thick skin; and whole worlds of beings may exist without his intellectual ken. Locke, how? ever, says truly that " how short soever our knowledge may be of a universal or perfect comprehension of whatever is, it yet secures our</page><page sequence="17">408 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. great concernment;" and again, " as to myself, I think God has given me assurance enough as to the existence of things without me; since, by their different application, I can produce in myself both pleasure and pain, which is one great concernment of my present state." If our faculties, then, are few and limited, and not designed to penetrate into the inward essence and constitution of things, they are yet suf? ficient for our purpose, the use of our intellectual consciousness being not to teach absolute truth, but to guide us towards our wants, which in their fulfilment are always pleasurable, and thus contribute towards the stock of happiness in the world. The world, then, is created within us. Certain forces derived from the food set the brain in motion, and other forces from without, coming through the senses, act upon these, and produce within us perception, or ideas, or nervous impressions of colour, form, size, a sense of resistance or weight, order, number, relative position, motion, likeness and unlikeness, and connection. These are called ideas of Simple and Relative perception, and Reflective Faculties. Simple ideas are real entities, formed or conditioned by the brain, and having no resemblance to anything out of the mind, or in the world : these simple ideas are by other faculties of the mind worked up into our conception of the world: for what would the world be without colour, or form, or size, etc. ? and yet colour, form, and size, etc, are ideas or feelings, not things. Properties, which we call of matter, are separate and distinct forces, but they are united by association in the mind, and rarely act singly, one generally calling the other into activity. Unity is also given to them in the mind, that is, by the faculty of Individuality, and we say these properties belong to body or matter. The same faculty individualises or gives unity to our separate ideas and feel? ings, and we say they belong to the mind, and more, we individualise each separate act of power or ability, dress this image in our attri? butes, and thus create a god after our own likeness, with our passions and modes of thought. It is to this unity of body and mind, which is a mere form of thought, to which we give the name of " I," and which assumes im? portance in proportion as it is associated with more or less of the feeling of self-esteem. All that is meant by this " Ego" is the suc? cession of ideas and feelings which constitutes consciousness. "I am," means only, these ideas and feelings are. The percipient, as when we say "I perceive," is the action of one class of faculties upon the others?it is reflection on consciousness, i. e., on perception. It is this also that accounts for the unity of consciousness; for although our ideas ancl feelings are simultaneously various, the reflective faculty that attends to them is one, and they can therefore only be attended to one at a time, whether they be simple or complex.</page><page sequence="18">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 409 The sequence and variation of our consciousness, and which we call modes of action of the mind, are divided into Perception, Conception, Memory, Imagination, and Judgment. The first of these?perception, is composed of the force within and the force from without, and there? fore has a double intensity to either of the others, which proceed from the action ofthe brain alone without the sense. Intensity of thought and feeling is always in proportion to the amount of force expended in pro? ducing it, and this furnishes a good criterion of externality, that is, of the difference between the ideas we receive from without and those that are the produce of the mind alone. The external world has thus double the reality of mere ideas; a child lives a life of sensation and perception, an old man one of ideas. The difference betw7een Primary and Second? ary qualities is not that generally recognised by metaphysicians between colour and extension, &amp;c, as the latter is as much in the mind as the former, but between the ideas of simple and relative percep? tion, that is, between the ideas received directly from without ancl those manufactured in the mind out of these. Belief?does it belong to the intellect, the emotions, or the will 1 James Mill resolves it into purely intellectual elements, but it is a feeling,?as Hume says,an act ofthe sensitive part of our nature, rather than of the cogitative, and we necessarily believe in the intuitions of our faculties. We take the results of their action for granted as fun? damental truths, and as nature obliges us to eat wTithout reasoning upon its necessity, so she obliges us to believe what is equally necessary for our action and well being, without reference to its absolute truth or even speculative reasonings. We reason and doubt afterwards, and begin to suspect that our faculties do not always tell us the truth. We believe in the real existence of the external world of our conscious? ness, and do not doubt till we find it is created within us. We believe in matter and in mind, and not in a correlation of forces or manifesta- tion of Divine Power. We believe that every effect has a cause, but that is no reason why it should be true ; there may be only sequence. We believe in Space as an objective reality, when, like motion, it is nothing in itself?it is that in which an entity exists, and is as inseparable from the entity as motion from the thing moving, or power from that of which it is the power. As to the necessary connection between cause and effect, of unalter- able laws, of the immutability of the laws of nature, consciousness tells us nothing about this. The higher probability is that this con? nection has been established for a purpose, and will continue as long as that purpose is required. J. S. Mill says, " Any must in this case, any necessity, other than the unconditional universality of the fact, we know nothing of . . . All I know is, that it always does." Reason is based upon the invariableness, upon the knowledge that what has</page><page sequence="19">410 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. taken place, in the same circumstances and under the same conditions, will take place again. Law, in my opinion, as I have said before, is automatic Will-power, and changeable should circumstances or con? ditions require. Oersted says, " the world is governed by an eternal reason, which makes known to us its actions by unalterable laws." I object to such terms as "eternal" and "unalterable" as we can know nothing about them. As far as we know, the same laws exist through? out the universe, but that is no reason why they should always con? tinue to do so. Laws of nature are attributes of Deity, and the mani? festations, if not the attributes, are ever changing. The sense of Personal Identity is, like faith or belief, a feeling, and not a mere intellectual perception. It is an instinct, an intuition, a pure creation of the mind. The " I " of which we are conscious, and which we say " thinks, wills, and feels," is, as we have seen, the aggre- gate of our boclily and mental states, to which unity has been given by a faculty of the mind. Any kind of sameness or identity must be a delusion, an anthopomorphism, for we are never the same for any two seconds together. In both mind and body we are part and parcel only of the ever-varying forces around us. This notion of " self" and identity is not dependent upon memory, for it remains when all memory is lost; past sensations give no such feeling. That it is de- pendent upon a condition of the brain is evident, as under certain states of excitement this sense is lost altogether, as in the case of the two gentlemen who had been dining out: in passing through a ford one of them fell into the water and called out to his companion, " I say, Bill, there is some one fallen-into the water." The feeling also of personality is sometimes " double," and otherwise deranged. What are we, then ? A mere correlation of forces. This may shock some people, but is it saying anything more than what every Chris? tian professes to believe, viz., that "in Him (God) we live and move and have our being"? For is not force or power as inseparable from its Great Source as motion from the thing moving ? Matter and mind, object and subject, are the same; all are force and all are sub? ject to the same laws of force, and we arrive at the great and fertile truth of " the reign of law, even in the realm of mind," as the Duke of Argyll expresses it.* This establishes man's dominion equally over the world of mind as of matter without any " freedom of will," or liberty to obey law or not, or cessation in the law of causation to bar * The Rev. C. A. Row, in the Contemporary Review for July last, says? "But God acts by law in the spiritual, no less than the material world; and there is no greater irreverence in investigating the mode of action in the one than in the other. Through whatever media it may be traced, it will be ultimately found that all spiritual vitality, no less than all material force, ultimately centres in Him."</page><page sequence="20">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 411 his progress. God would not have trusted men with such a fatal gift as this, for not only would it have stopped all progress, but he might have damned himself, and all his race with it, as theologians say Adam did. The strongest force, or motive power, prevails every where with? out exception. Men can no more resist the strongest motive, which means motive or moving force, in mind than in body. He has a desire, which is an impelling force, to act selfishly, which is wrong; if his sense of right or other motive is stronger he will abstain, not without. What then! these forces are under the control of law and order, and can be strengthened as it may be found desirable, and cannot be capriciously exercised at what is called the " free will" of the owner. How is it, then, that this great truth has been so long hidden, and is not now accepted ? Because consciousness does not include the external force of which will is composed, and by which it is determined. As Spinoza says, " Human liberty, of which all boast, consists solely in this, that man is conscious of his will, and unconscious of the causes by which it is determined." But if man is not " free," but, like every? thing else, must act in accordance with the laws of his being; what then, it is asked, become of the interests of morality 1 what of Con? science and Responsibility 1 The interests of morality are safe enough, as all the laws of man's being tend to the production of the largest amount of enjoyment?of pleasurable sensation, which I maintain is the object of all consciousness. As to responsibility, about which so much is said, it simply means that we must accept the consequences of our actions; and when we know what these are we regulate our conduct accordingly. As to conscience, it is merely inherited experience of what is good or bad, that is, pleasurable or painful. It is a cow's con? science that makes it want to toss every dog it sees, from the inherited effects of dogs' ill conduct towards the cow's paternal ancestors in bull-baiting, which so universally prevailed in England fifty years ago. A cow has a conscientious objection to dogs in general, and she tosses her head every time she sees one, very much as some young ladies do at fast young puppies of another race. Conscience is innate, that is, it is, "the gathered-up experience of bygone generations, transmitted to us by inheritance." It is founded upon experience, although not our experience. Oersted thus describes its origin, " It could not be otherwise but that man presupposed in his fellow creatures an intellectual being like himself. When one man excited an agreeable feeling in another there arose love ; if the reverse was the case, hatred. Such influences may have given rise to the idea of a something in the actions of a man, which is to be reproved or to be rejected; and this small beginning became the seed of the notion of right and wrong." Good ancl evil are purely subjective, and the moral world is as entire</page><page sequence="21">412 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. a creation of the mind as the physical world. It is merely a record of man's pleasure ancl pains, of his likes and antipathies, and of the various fine names by which he distinguishes the different varieties of feelings as he wishes to promote the one ancl to prevent the other. As our thoughts and ideas compel a reference to objects out of self, so do our feelings, and we talk of the eternal and immutable distinctions between right and wrong, whereas these distinctions have no existence out of ourselves, and one action is as good as another in itself, and is good, pure, holy, &amp;c, in proportion as it tends to carry out the purpose of creation, which is not man's happiness alone, but that of all of sensitive existence. Morality is the science of living together in the most happy manner possible; at present it is confined to men alone, but we must widen its sphere of action so as ultimately to take in all living creatures. Do not let us be alarmed, then, for the interests of morality, for as J. S. Mill says, " a volition is a moral effect, which follows the corresponding moral causes as certainly and invariably as physical effects follow their physical causes." Physical science has made rapid progress since the introduction of the inductive method, while mental science, to which it is supposed not to apply, is little further advanced than it was two thousand years ago; but on the recognition of this great truth, that causation is as constant, and that law reigns as much in the realm of mind as of matter, our future progress in this department must depend. This truth occupies, in the present day, much the same position in mental science, as the earth's position with respect to the sun in the days of Copernicus did in physics. Men saw that the sun went round the earth, and the Bible said it did, and Galileo was imprisoned for saying it did not. A student of that day being asked at his examination on theology whether the sun went round the earth, or the earth round the sun, answered, "Sometimes one, and sometimes the other." This is precisely the attitude of our philosophers and our men of science of the present day towards this doctrine of philosophical necessity, or of mind governed by law. Men say they now feel that they are free, as they before saw that the sun went round the earth ; and theologians say that responsibility, which, according to them, is the right to take revenge for past misconduct, depends upon this free? dom, and that morality depends upon this kind of responsibility ; and when our philosophers are appealed to as to whether man is free, or subject to law, like everything else, they say, " Sometimes one, ancl sometimes the other." To give an instance in each class : Froude, the philosopher, says, "The foolish ancl the ignorant are led astray by the idea of contingency, and expect to escape the just issue of their actions ; the wise man will know that each action brings with it its inevitable consequences, which even God cannot change without</page><page sequence="22">BRAY ON PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS. 413 ceasing to be Himself."* Praise and blame " involve that somew7here or other the influence of causes ceases to operate, and that some degree of power there is in man of self-determination, by the amount of which, and not by their specific actions, moral merit or demerit is to be measured."t How "inevitable consequences" are to be expected where "causescease to operate," he does not tell us; but no doubt the earth goes round the sun in physics, and the sun round the earth where man's volition is concerned. Huxley, the man of science, says, " Theology, in her purer forms, has ceased to be anthropo- morphic, however she may talk. Anthropomorphism has taken her stand in its last fortress?man himself. But science closely invests the walls; and philosophers gird themselves for battle upon the last and greatest of all speculative problems. Does human nature pos? sess any free volitional or truly anthropomorphic element, or is it only the cunningest of all nature's clocks ? Some, among whom I count myself, think that the battle will for ever remain a drawn one, and that, for all practical purposes, this result is as good as anthro? pomorphism wTinning the day."J Notwithstanding, we are slowly, but surely, coming to the convic- tion that in nature there is no beginning,?merely pre-existent and persistent force ancl its correlates?that is, " that each manifestation of force can be interpreted only as the effect of some antecedent force, no matter whether it be an inorganic action, an animal move? ment, a thought or feeling" ;? that all force, or power, or ability is derived and inseparable from that of which it is the force?the Supreme Cause of all. If we have lost matter, we have found force; if wre have lost mind?a supposititious, capricious existence, governed by nothing?we have found universal law, and "a supreme and infinite and everlasting Mind in synthesis with all things." In the correlation of force, we have one great heart-beat of the Absolute Existence. "Being underlies all modes and forms of being."|| " Nature is an infinitely divided God.Tbe Divine One has dis- pensed itself into innumerable sensible substances, as a white beam of light is decomposed by the prism with seven coloured rays. And a divine being would be evolved from the union of all these sub? stances, as the seven coloured rays dissolve again into the clear-light beam. The existing form of nature is the optic glass, and all the activities of spirit are only an infinite colour-play of that simple divine ray."H * Froude's Essays, Spinoza, vol. ii, p. 48. f Idem., p. 59.
