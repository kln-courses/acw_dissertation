BINGHAM [Plates 8-9] THE FAMILY GROUP During the summer of 1924 the writer had the unique privilege of observing social relations in a chimpanzee family.' The three indi- viduals comprising this family group were housed in a commodious cage near Havana, Cuba. Jimmy, the father, probably twenty-five years old, was an irascible male who had been mated once before the present mating. Monona, a mother for the first time,2 was probably not more than twelve years old. Lita, the female child, was born on January 22, 1923, and during the period of observation was between the known ages of seventeen and twenty months.3 This relatively simple unit of chimpanzee society was separately housed in a colony of infrabuman primates consisting of fourteen chim- panzees in addition to many monkeys, baboons, a gibbon, and three ' This opportunity was provided through the generosity of Madame Rosalie Abreu and the financial support of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The private grounds and home of the former, known as the Quinta Palatino, were freely opened to a scientific group headed by Prof. Robert M. Yerkes. As a member of this group the writer enjoyed unlimited freedom for observing a remarkable collection of primates. For the hospitality of Madame Abreu, an honorarium from the Carnegie Institution, and the invitation of Professor Yerkes to join the party of observers, my heartiest thanks are due. 2 On March 24, 1926, she gave birth to a second female baby, Cubita. a Further description of the individual members of this family appears in Almost Human by Robert M. Yerkes, chapters 4 and 10. Supplementary facts bearing on the colony as a whole appear in chapter 3. 77 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, VOL. 8, NO. 2</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY orang-utans. The majority of the chimpanzees were in a stage of development readily recognizable as childhood. Three chimpanzees, perhaps,-a male and two females-had reached early adolescence. Ranging from the end of infancy or early childhood to adult parenthood, therefore, this collection of animals furnished rare opportunities for comparing various aspects of social behavior in which the family group naturally occupied a central place. From the first there were observed striking differences between the social activities of the family, on the one hand, and, on the other, those of the non-family groups. In all groups there were significant changes as acquaintance progressed between the chimpanzees and their human visitors. Among the adolescent and pre-adolescent chimpan- zees a rough-and-tumble variety of play tended at first to dominate the observer's attention, but shortly there appeared less spectacular but more subtle and still more fascinating varieties of social behavior. Such changes in observations doubtless were due in part to the observer's increasing background, but the behavior of the animals was unmistak- ably different after they became accustomed to a foreign gallery. In contrast with the romping playfulness of the young animals, Monona seemed to exercise ceaseless vigilance over her child. Never, it seemed, was Lita permitted to get out of the range of Monona's vision. If Lita went from one room to the other, she was consistently followed by Monona. Jimmy seemed never to take responsibility for the care of the child. On the other hand, he was never seen to interfere with the welfare of the child or mother although Monona took no chances when one of his expressons of temper was released. On such occasions she took the child on her back and climbed, whimpering, beyond the range of his violent behavior. Once or twice, Lita seemed to whimper also, but this uncertain observation was not satisfactorily confirmed. Dur- ing none of these emotional outbursts, however, was he ever observed to threaten Monona or Lita.4 Generally the family life was remarkably peaceful. This family situation was one that readily challenged the observer to look for activities, especially in the mother, indicative of less seriousness than the primary business of protection. An unverified report came from the caretakers that Jimmy often, Monona never, played with the child. After many hours of daily observations at the family cage, at 4Fear that Jimmy might injure the child was expressed by attendants who regularly hurried to the cage when one of his uproars began and, from the out- side, drove him with threats into an isolated compartment. 78</page><page sequence="3">BINGHAM--PLAY OF CHIMPANZEES least a partial list of maternal play activities was obtained, but more than once Jimmy played with Lita before Monona was seen to play with her at all. In my presence he played less slyly than Monona. Also, he revealed less variety than she. Efforts to photograph such activities were always unfruitful because the necessary equipment was consistently avoided by the parents. By Monona, also, the more trustful and playful Lita was quite successfully kept away from the cameras. Four reproductions on each of two ac- companying plates represent fairly typical photographs of the mother in non-playful poses. Maternal relaxation was always discouraged by the presence of a camera, but Lita often responded playfully.5 The four pictures in plate 8 represent the mother and child caught unexpectedly. In figure 3 Lita, and in 4 Monona, only, is looking towards the camera. In figures 5 and 6 of plate 9, Lita has started towards the photographer. She usually came forward so rapidly that she was quickly out of focus and the photograph failed. Also, she frequently stamped with her feet, evidently in play threats, at the photographer. Figure 6 shows her in such an approach. In both 5 and 6, Monona is seen about to start after the heedless child, and in 7 and 8 she was photographed shortly after recovering Lita. She was walking rapidly in both cases. The fact that she walked through a spot of sunlight in the heavily shaded cage made the eighth photograph possible. In it her irritation is indicated by the upstanding hair on head and shoulders and, possibly, by the lips. The failure to record photographically the play activities that took place was a disappointment and a misfortune. The gross behavior described in this paper was accompanied by less easily describable variations in facial expression which supplemented significantly the 6 Disturbances in the family accompanying photographic preparations are con- cretely illustrated by a recorded observation on July 17: "Cameras were placed near the cage in an effort to get photographs of the family. Jimmy was thoroughly excited and repeated over and over his 'stallion-like' roaring and banging. It was at this time that a rare indication of maternal roughness towards the child was observed. My attention was first attracted when Lita seemed tobecrying softly. When I looked, the mother was following Lita who seemed to be trying to run away. Monona, who easily caught Lita, pulled her back roughly, swung the child around to her side, and clearly offered opportunity for Lita to mount her back. Monona reached down and back and seemed to push or lift the child towards her back, but Lita did not get up. She compromised by putting up one hand, clinging to the hair at the mother's side, and walking alongside (see plate 9, fig. 8). Monona made low vocal sounds as she paced about the cage with Lita." 79</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY recorded facts. Without photographic records for sustained inspection, however, such details can not be reported with certainty. In such omissions the reader is deprived of essential facts that exerted consider- able influence on the observer. Perseverance in the development of appropriate facilities for photographic records of activities that are uninfluenced by human observers will, no doubt, ultimately eliminate the necessity of such omissions. The evidences of parental play are supplemented in the following account with certain observations reported to the Institute of Psychol- ogy by Mrs. Helen M. Ireland who made occasional visits to the Quinta Palatino following the birth of Cubita, Monona's second baby. These recent records by Mrs. Ireland confirm or supplement certain portions of the play between Monona and Lita previously recorded and now reported by the writer. The combination of facts has particular significance because Lita had reached the beginning of childhood whereas Cubita was observed during the early weeks of infancy.6 THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT This family of chimpanzees was housed in an outdoor cage nearly sixty feet long and thirty feet wide. The corners were rounded giving it the appearance of an ellipse with flattened sides. From one side three doors led to as many separate dens or sleeping compartments. The entire structure, including various artistic features, was deeply shaded by the foliage of large trees. A water-tight roof covered approximately the middle forty feet of the cage. The cage was divided by a partition of vertical bars into two rooms, designated A and B. A small doorway connected the two rooms. The partition, like most parts of the enclosure bars, was covered with wire mesh to prevent the confined animals from reaching through. Across the upper part of the cage horizontal beams of iron or steel were joined to opposite sides. The cage was further braced by oblique bars joined above to the horizontal cross beams and two-thirds of the way down to the vertical bars. These braces were commonly used by the animals for climbing to the attic where several shelves had been arranged. The 6 The observations of Mrs. Ireland cover a period of infancy parallel to observa- tions reported on a different chimpanzee mother by G. J. von Allesch (see p. 88). A comparison of Mrs. Ireland's notes and von Allesch's report leaves the writer with the impression that Cubita was more precocious and better cared for by the mother than the infant observed by von Allesch. One wonders, if such be the case, whether Monona's earlier experience in rearing Lita is a significant factor. 80</page><page sequence="5">BINGHAM-PLAY OF CHIMPANZEES lower ends of the vertical bars were embedded in a substantial curbing of concrete. The entire floor was made of concrete. Room B included approximately one-third of the entire cage. It contained a round table with two chairs at opposite sides of the table. These immovable furnishings were made of reinforced concrete. In this room all of the recorded play by Monona and Litawasobserved. Occa- sionally Jimmy was confined in the adjoining compartment, A, but for the most part the family had free access to any part of the cage. In room A the play of Monona with Cubita, as recorded in and selected from the general notes of Mrs. Ireland, took place. This room con- tained a concrete arch and a sunken (dry) watering tank. Throughout Mrs. Ireland's observations during Cubita's infancy, Jimmy was con- fined alone in B. On account of the size of the family cage and the importance of the observer remaining inconspicuous, there were difficulties in following the activities of the family group without interruption. On several occa- sions play activities were witnessed but they could not be adequately described. The most favorable opportunity for such observations and descriptions came when the animals were confined in a single room. PATERNAL PLAY Jimmy's playfulness was conspicuously limited when compared with that of younger chimpanzees. Romping, tumbling, swinging, and other forms of vigorous play were rarely, if ever, exhibited by him. On the other hand, he responded with evident playfulness in various situations whereas Monona's playfulness seemed even more restricted and limited to Lita. To the foreman of the Quinta Palatino, and even to the visit- ing observers, Jimmy frequently responded playfully. Such responses probably were no less frequent than his outbursts of temper. The following summary of Jimmy's play with the foreman (L) was observed with variations several times: Outside Jimmy's cage, L slaps wire mesh; Jimmy from inside responds similarly and opens his mouth in good humor. L puts a finger through the wire mesh, the end turned upwards; Jimmy hooks the end of his finger over L's and pulls. Re- peated many times. L bends fingers in chimpanzee fashion and strikes wire mesh; Jimmy responds similarly at same place. L takes Jimmy's fingers through wire mesh and trims finger nails; Jimmy sits patiently and watches the procedure. Some three weeks after observations began, my notes contain a refer- ence to Jimmy's initial playful response to Professor Yerkes and me: As 81</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY usual we stopped this morning (July 25) before the family cage on arri- val at the Quinta Palatino. Jimmy lay on the table in room B. As we paused, Professor Yerkes said, "Hello Jim." Slowly Jimmy got down from the table, rose to erect position, and suddenly ran at us, spatting his feet on the floor, and slapped the cage before our faces. It was a startling change from the lazy appearing animal that got off the table. This manifestation of playfulness was unusual. During the first two weeks of our visit, Jimmy quite consistently gave vent each morning to violent yelling and furious rushes about the cage when we arrived at the Quinta Palatino. Jimmy's play with Lita was first noted on July 7. It was my fourth day of observation at the Quinta Palatino and several days before any of the animals showed familiarity with me. The entire afternoon was used in watching the family activities. The following activities took place within a half-hour period. Jimmy, Monona, and Lita had been lying in A near the sunken water- ing tank. The parents were eating mangoes and Lita was playing on the floor some eight or ten feet distant. Jimmy got up and lazily approached Lita, stood on all fours with his head extended forward and downward towards her, and looked at her for a minute or more as she continued her kittenlike play. Occasionally he rolled his eyes, without turning his head, toward me. (I was compelled to move somewhat in order to get a clear view of the animals and he was evidently watching me.) Monona now got up, walked past Jimmy and Lita, and was closely followed into B by Lita. Presently Lita climbed one of the brace rods to a cross beam. From the side of the cage she walked out some twelve or fifteen feet. Jimmy, who had also gone to B, climbed to the cross beam as Lita had done. Instead of getting on the steel beam like Lita, he grasped it from below with hands and feet, walked out, upside down, to a position directly under her. Lita now turned around on the cross beam and walked back to the side of the cage. As she returned, Jimmy backed up keeping himself directly below her. When they reached the side of the cage, Lita climbed down, but Jimmy continued to hold himself suspended from the cross bar. He rotated his head as though to watch her and when she reached the floor he extended a hand which she grasped with both of her own hands. Then he swung her back and forth, perhaps a half dozen times, covering an arc of six feet or more. Later, in another part of the cage, the family had again assembled. 82</page><page sequence="7">BINGHAM-PLAY OF CHIMPANZEES Jimmy, sitting on his haunches, reached over and pinched Lita. His behavior was very similar to Monona's as described under grasping and tumbling (p. 85).7 7 This literal account, when read in manuscript, arouses pictures of a chimpanzee family so different from those which came with first hand contacts, that I am compelled to recognize its failure to convey a true spirit of the situation. The chief reason, I believe, lies in the elimination from the manuscript of spontaneous interpretations which appear without inhibitions in the daily notes. The in- adequacy of the objective report is so apparent in review that I am led to supple- ment it with this appended note in an effort to correct the loss of that spontaneity which actually existed at the time of the observations. The necessity of objec- tive reports is fully recognized, but it seems unscientific to close one's eyes to the probable injustice, especially when dealing with man-like animals, that our scientific shyings at anthropomorphism have introduced. The letter quoted below is highly anthropomorphic. It has the merit, I be- lieve, of describing a particular aspect of the family situation in the chimpanzee cage, intelligibly and honestly. I should be better satisfied if the paper as a whole represented a fair compromise between the two extremes. The letter, as the con- text indicates, was written for an audience of children but, in spite of the per- sonal nature, it is quoted in part, and without editing, as an illustration of my observations when reported without subjective restraints: "Reina 48, Piso 2?, Havana, July 10, 1924. My dear Robert: You have probably heard the letter I wrote to Bernice about the Chimpanzee family. If not, perhaps you can get mother to read it to you. I told Bernice about the father and mother Chimpanzee and their baby. Baby Chimpanzee's birthday is the same day as mine and it was just one year old last January 21st. [January 22 was later found to be the correct date.] Mother Chimpanzee and Baby seldom play together. I guess it's about the same as with your mother. She is too busy looking after you and George to play. This mother thinks she hasn't time for play, but the father Chimpanzee plays with his baby a lot. But yesterday, I saw the mother play, in her way, with her baby. The mother Chimpanzee plays differently with the baby than the father Chimpanzee. The mother was lying on her back and her short legs stuck up in the air. She held baby Chimpanzee in her big hands, and baby's face lay against the mother's cheek. Then they rubbed noses and cheeks, and I suppose they gave each other some butterfly kisses. I saw them kissing with their lips several times, but they did not smack. They just put their lips together. Occasionally, too, the mother Chimpanzee would nip baby's ear. They played for several minutes as I have seen you and your mother play, especially before you could walk. After a while baby Chimpanzee climbed on the mother's back and rode around the cage. Then the baby got down and climbed up the side of the cage. Baby played there for some time, then jumped down, and landed pretty hard. Her 83</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY MATERNAL PLAY On July 12, 1924, Monona and Lita were confined in room B. Jimmy was in A. During three hours of continuous observation practically all forms of play that appeared throughout the summer were manifested by Monona. More complete and unified records of maternal play, with fewer ambiguities, were obtained at this time than at any other observation period. With this one exception Monona was never seen to exhibit more than one or two forms of play during a single period of observation. Most of the quoted notes are selected from the records of that day. Aside from the separation from Jimmy this situation on July 12 con- tained another unusual feature. The heat was highly oppressive and all of the animals, human attendants included, were significantly quiet. Lita played somewhat kittenlike on the floor of the cage and Monona changed restlessly from place to place. After lying down she would change her position repeatedly before moving to another place. Lita usually followed the mother during such changes of location. Occa- sionally Monona followed Lita. Submissiveness. This topic is introductory to several aspects of the mother's play. It signifies in a general way a relaxation of parental sternness. Monona's toleration of Lita's activities, at times, could be sharply distinguished from her restraints, at others. Opposition to Lita's play was seldom noted when the activities centered about the mother, but if Lita played elsewhere, for example, through the bars with human spectators, Monona often interfered by taking her away. An example of Monona's submissiveness appeared on July 12. A few minutes earlier she had been playing mildly with Lita in a manner similar to that described below under hand and foot claspina. When this play ceased, Monona lay down on the floor. Lita continued by picking at Monona's feet and toes without eliciting responses other than spreading and closing of toes. Lita's manipulations now changed little feet slapped quite loudly on the cement floor and she whined just a little and held out her hands to her mother who got up and went near so baby could get on her back again. Pretty soon Father Chimpanzee came around and Mother Chimpanzee, carry- ing Baby, began to walk slowly around the cage. Father Chimpanzee fell in directly behind and thus they paraded about for a long time. It makes me think of you and George when you march, only the Chimpanzee family made no noise. They stepped softly, and more slowly than you and George, and the 'band' was not played. Their parade was slow and very quiet." 84</page><page sequence="9">BINGHAM-PLAY OF CHIMPANZEES from the mother's feet to anus which she inspected visually and tactu- ally. Then she spread the external genitalia, peeredwithin, and inserted her lips at least three times. She seemed to treat this part of the mother's anatomy as something merely to manipulate and explore. The mother permitted all of this picking and pulling without noticeable protest or unusual response. Significant was Monona's apparent in- difference to Lita's activities. Her line of visual regard was quite away from the child's location. There were other occasions when the mother seemed to watch closely the antics of the little one but with no exercise of restraint. Such be- havior seemed to be intermediate between the lazy toleration of the child's playfulness on the one hand, and active participation in the play on the other. At such times, the mother usually sat on her haunches and rotated her head in relation to Lita's changes in location. This visual pursuit sometimes immediately preceded and regularly accom- panied some of the maternal play activities which follow. Hand and foot clasping. The manual activities of Lita, in this role, represent a variation of the 'picking' at Monona's feet and toes described above. Monona was stretched out on the floor near the table with her feet against one of the chairs. Lita climbed upon the back of the chair from which she reached down and pulled playfully at the mother's toes. The mother raised her foot, moved it about above her body, and spread and closed the toes as though seeking contact with Lita's hand. When such contact was established both closed momentarily in a clasp, pulled lightly against each other until the hold was relinquished, and promptly renewed the clasp in similar manner. Not less than a half dozen such contacts were made. Lita, from her position above, followed rather closely with her hand the devious course of Monona's foot. At times it appeared that Monona's foot movements avoided Lita's hand clasp. This particular aspect of the play probably lasted between one and two minutes. Grasping and tumbling. This form of play was commonly preceded by the visual regard described above under submissiveness. Monona was sitting on her haunches and Lita was walking about near at hand. As Lita came within Monana's reach, the mother extended a hand, grasped her about the body and legs, and pulled lightly but with suffi- cient force to cause Lita to sprawl, slide, and roll towards Monona. The mother did not follow up the act beyond continuing to look at the scrambling Lita regain her feet. Shortly, when Lita again came near, Monona caught Lita's hand in her own, gave it a light pull, but released the grasp almost as soon as Lita resisted. 85</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY Hugging and fondling. On another occasion the foregoing tumbling and grasping behavior was carried further. Monona lay down on her side and extended an arm as though inviting Lita to come. Lita went and lay close against the mother's breast while Monona encircled her with the arm that had been extended. Lita did not nurse.8 She cuddled up momentarily, then climbed out of the mother's arms, over her body, and to the floor at her back. On another day there was noted similar be- havior when the mother held the child in her two hands and brought their faces close together. In this act there was detected no sign of cleaning or licking.9 Tickling. This variety of maternal play is closely related to the fore- going. The following account is taken from my notes of July 12. Once again Lita was pulled by the mother and rolled on her back. The mother placed her fingers lightly in various places on Lita's upturned body. Lita was obviously 'tickled' by the procedure. She squirmed, rolled, and drew her feet and hands close together over the upturned ven- tral surface. She grasped the mother's hand with all fours. Monona withdrew her hand from Lita's grasp and returned it several times to Lita's body. The foregoing note was supplemented when written by the following comment: "No unprejudiced observer, I am sure, could have watched this behavior without defining it as 'tickling."' The interpretation of this behavior was confirmed in two wholly independent observations reported by Mrs. Ireland under date of June 11, 1926. Monona was holding her second infant, Cubita, who had reached the eightieth day. Having retired to a step leading to one of the dens, Monona "holds babe in arms, opens mouth, runs mouth and lips over babe's head, and tickles babe's chest." This record strongly suggests chance tickling through cleaning of offspring, but the following seems more certainly detached from the cleaning act: "Monona, chew- ing remnants of fruit, idly passes hand over babe's fingers and toes, and rests for a moment with tickling motions under babe's chin." Rocking and carrying. Other adaptations of hugging and fondling due, perhaps, to age differences in the offspring were recorded by Mrs. Ireland on various days in April, 1926. "Monona at intervals raised 8 Throughout the summer, Lita was seen only once to take the nipple in her lips and then only for a moment. Yet, on several occasions, Lita was held sig- nificantly in the arms of the mother. The two were never observed after they went to bed. 9 Maternal cleaning of chimpanzee infants with lips and tongue is probably common. Lita had evidently outgrown such care by the mother. 86</page><page sequence="11">BINGHAM-PLAY OF CHIMPANZEES Cubita (tenth day) towards her breast by placing a hand under the babe's buttocks. Presently Monona let the babe's head lay back in her cupped arm. With the babe's head thus pillowed, Monona gently moved her arm back and forth while she bent her head closely above the small figure she thus rocked." Cubita, twenty-first day: "Monona went to edge of cage and sat with feet squarely planted towards curb of cage; held babe's head in cupped hands, jogged it up and down, bent face close to nursling, and made faint kissing sound." An elaboration of the foregoing behavior was also observed by Mrs. Ireland on Cubita's thirty-seventh day: "Monona, stretched at length on shelf, cuddles babe up and down against her breast. Babe makes continuous clucking sounds suggestive of content. Babe is turned on back'and Monona's forefinger plays back and forth under babe's chin; its pink hands and feet wave gently .... Holding babe in arms she rocks it to and fro in attitude of intense maternal devotion. "Observer's eyes were momentarily turned away and as she looked back Monona was walking slowly across the floor, gently placing each extremity with careful precision. The babe was riding on Monona's head, bunched up, and clinging with hands and feet.10 Monona raised hand at every step to feel child. The head carrying lasted three minutes." April 30, 1926, Cubita's thirty-eighth day: "Mother lying on back, holds babe by upper arms and raises it so high that babe's heels rest in mother's eye sockets. Monona blinks but continues to sway child up and down." 10 In a paper scheduled for later publication on sexual behavior of chimpanzees, there will be described a striking similarity in placement and carriage of pieces of mango by a female, Sita, who was nearing sexual maturity. With Malapulga, a sexually mature female, Sita was caged close enough to the family cage to permit the occupants of either cage limited visibility of each other. For direct compari- son with Monona's head carrying of Cubita, selections from my notes of July 11, 1924, are quoted in this connection. "Sita and Malapulga had been eating mangoes. Sita took a partially split mango from which the seed had been removed and spread the two halves over her head. She shifted it to various places on and above her shoulders before the joined halves were insecurely lodged over a shoulder. Then she began to walk gingerly about the cage. Her shoulders were conspicuously elevated; her neck seemed bowed and rigid. When she started to climb the fruit fell off. She picked it up and carefully arranged it on the back of her head with a half on either side. In this position it remained two or three minutes while she went slowly about on all fours. .... Repeatedly she was observed to hold a hand as though to catch it should it fall and then to touch it with a hand as though to replace or readjust the fruit." 87</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY G. J. von Allesch1" reports an interesting genesis of the rocking beha- vior in Loca (previously named Rana by Kohler): "From the first day on (following the birth of her male baby) she trembled greatly due obviously to her general exhaustion. This trembling was distributed over the whole body or limited to certain parts, especially the arms or thighs. In the second week it was observed that this trembling of the thighs looked more and more like a dandling movement (Schaukelbe- wegung) and in the activity one could see a little later that the body of the young one was set in motion by the old one especially by patting the back with her hands. Gradually this motion became better defined and developed into a frequently used method of quieting, use of which was not made, however, when perchance the young one responded like- wise or made a sound of distress, but at such times as the old one her- self became excited or anticipated a danger which was commonly accompanied by a cry of distress from the young one. Whether this shaking had an independent origin or was only an adaptation of the reflex trembling could not be determined through the observations." 'Uber Stock und Stein.' Another variety of maternal play has been reported by von Allesch12 as observed in Loca when her baby was two and one-half months old. At this age the little male was making feeble excursions over the body of the mother, being unable to stand with any security on his bow-legs. His laborious journeys were made under the protection of a mother's hand and his own cautious clinging to the mother. "At this time Loca invented a special play. She lay on her back and held with her foot a little leg of the young one, let him crawl over her body, and then quickly drew him back again 'over hill and dale."' It seems probable that Loca's behavior was essentially similar to that of Monona as described above under hand and foot clasping and grasping and tumbling. The main difference, it may well be, is to be found in the adaptations of the mothers to the different ages of their offspring. Maternal tuition. A brief account by von Alleschl3 pertaining to locomotion at the end of the third month and beginning of the fourth month seems to deserve a place in this list of activities. Loca stood over him, held him by a hand, and compelled him, as she went back- wards, to follow her on three legs; or she took him near herself and slowly led him floundering, going forward. At first this was rare and irregular 1 Bericht uber die drei ersten Lebensmonate eines Schimpansen, Sitz. d. Pr. Akad., 1921, p. 684; also, Die Naturwis., 1921, 9, 774-776. 12 Sitz. d. Pr.

Regularly she moved away with the child. It was ex- ceptional, as in 3, to get an opportunity for a photograph when the eyes of the mother were not on the photographer. Lita, on the contrary, usually approached the photographer. With the consent of the writer, 1 and 4 were previously published in Almost Human by Robert M.

In 8, Lita resisted taking a place on the mother's back; she compromised by going but without mounting the mother's back.

PLATE 9</page><page sequence="15">BINGHAM-PLAY OF CHIMPANZEES but by the end of the fourth month it was more significant and lasted over periods of ten minutes. Hindrances like stones and holes made no difference. Only when he tumbled and cried was he lifted up. In the beginning of the fifth month he was made to wade through a puddle of rain water. This was recognized as a special performance. At the same time the mother, scrambling up a high bank, tried for the first time not to carry but to lead him by the hand. Chasing and evasion. This form of play obviously does not occur until the youngster's locomotor powers are fairly well developed. The following is taken from my notes when Lita was near the end of the seventeenth month: "Monona and Lita moved to the side of the cage near my observation post. Lita took a pebble from me when she climbed on the side of the cage and looked out. Monona took Lita by the foot and pulled her down. Then she walked, followed by Lita, to the other side of the cage. As they proceeded Lita grabbed playfully at the mother's feet and, seemingly in response, Monona increased her rate. They went thus around the cage (room B). Then Monona walked around the table and chairs, but in the meantime Lita had gone between the table and a chair to cut in ahead of Monona. Monona reversed her direction and Lita followed. The rate was now such that Lita had to run to keep pace. Three times the cutting in and reversal of direction took place. Monona did not run at any time, but she varied her strides and pace conspicuously.'4 "Following this unusual locomotor activity, Monona sat down on her haunches. Lita went up to her and was hugged close to Monona with both arms. The embrace had the appearance of an affectionate hug terminating a mild romp." Boxing. This activity was never manifested by Monona, but Lita frequently swung her arms in a manner resembling boxing. The sug- gestion that the mother might have previously participated in such play occurred on a single occasion. Lita ran up before her mother and, standing erect, swung both arms before Monona's face in crude boxing gestures. To the little one's arm swinging Monona made no manual response and she appeared surprisingly indifferent to it. Lita's manner of approach, in this instance, as well as the frequency with which such play has been observed among other young chimpanzees, is responsible for the suggestion that the mother might play a r6leinthe development of such activities in her offspring.
