<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews CAIRD, G. B. The Language and Imagery of the Bible. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1980. viii+ 280 pp. $20.00. G. B. Caird has written "a text book of elementary semantics" (p. 2) which brings the discipline of linguistic analysis to bear on biblical studies. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1, under the heading "General," covers three topics. First, it distinguishes and illustrates various ways in which language is used: referential (informative, cognitive), commissive (performative/causative, expressive/evocative), and cohesive (to provide a means of communal solidarity). Second, it discusses the meaning of meaning. Here Caird enunciates a position which is fundamental to his book: "the meaning of a sentence is what the speaker intends to convey by it" (p. 39). Third, it dis- cusses some of the particularities of biblical language which arise from Hebrew idiom and Septuagintal Greek. Part 2 is devoted to metaphor. Here Caird is concerned to show the nonliteral character of much biblical language. It must be said that he is far more successful in illustrating a variety of nonliteral uses than in giving pre- cision to the commonsense notion of "literal" which he uses as a foil. Part 2 goes on to examine the particular biblical issues of parable interpretation and anthropomorphism and to provide criteria for judging an author's awareness of the nonliteral character of his language. Part 3 is devoted to history, myth, and eschatology. Caird's thesis is "that myth and eschatology are metaphor systems for the theological interpretation of historical events" (p. 219). On the one hand he opposes the depreciation of the historical by Bultmann. On the other hand he denounces "flat-footed literalness" and argues that the biblical authors were aware of the symbolic character of their language. Caird's book is written as an elementary textbook. In some sections it is quite rudimentary, as when he explains the difference between simile and metaphor and lists the various figures of speech (metonymy, circumlocution, etc.). The abundance of biblical examples keeps the book readable throughout. Caird is at his best when poking fun at, for example, J. A. T. Robinson's statement that Christians 'tare in literal fact the risen organism of Christ's person" (pp. 131-32; compare "our rector is literally the father of every boy and girl in the village"). His most important contribution lies in drawing attention to the various kinds of language and in his sustained onslaught on the common assumption that all biblical language is referential. By highlighting questions of linguistic status he provides a perspective on biblical criticism which can only be salutary for traditional historical critics. The value of the book would be enhanced if Caird entered dialogue with (or even showed an awareness of) the expanding use of linguistic and semiotic theory in recent biblical scholarship, represented, for instance, in the journals Semeia and Linguistica Biblica. His discussion of the parables ignores a decade of American scholarship which moved the discussion well beyond the stage of Dodd and Jeremias. The most fundamental problem with the book, however, lies in Caird's dogmatic insistence that the author's intention is the norm of Permission to reprint a book review printed in this section may be obtained only from the author. 183</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion meaning. This view can, of course, be defended, but it can scarcely be assumed without argument. Caird refers to "the intentional fallacy" on page 61 but mistakenly defines it as "the error of supposing that a writer meant some- thing other than he has actually written." The argument of Beardsley and Wimsatt, in their famous article, was, quite explicitly, "that the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art" ("The Intentional Fallacy" in The Verbal Icon, by W. K. Wimsatt [Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1954], p. 3). In short "the intentional fallacy" is the error of supposing that the author's intention is the norm of meaning, precisely the position of Caird. Caird's insistence on authorial intention muddies the waters in his discus- sion of biblical problems. Two examples must suffice. Caird wishes to refute Bultmann's assertion that "the resurrection itself is not an event of past history. All that historical criticism can establish is the fact that the first disciples came to believe in the resurrection" (p. 217). His argument is that "the first disciples did not come to believe in the resurrection as an event which happened to themselves . . . but as an event which happened to Jesus. . . . They may have been mistaken . . . but they claimed to be speaking about a matter of fact." Bultmann, of course, would not dispute this, and it in no way refutes his position. The question is whether the meaning of the resurrection proclama- tion is exhausted by the understanding of the first Christians. A somewhat different problem arises in connection with eschatology. Here Caird insists on the symbolic character of the language and so is obliged to argue that it was not intended literally. So he writes of Luke and Paul: "these two intelligent men, each with an intimate knowledge of the Old Testament, must surely have been alert to the limitations of language in expressing the relation of time to eternity" (p. 248). The question here is whether a prophetic or poetically inclined author, however intelligent, necessarily made the same clear-cut distinction between literal and nonliteral as a modern critic. This problem is not resolved by declaring that Weiss and Schweitzer had "pedestrian" minds (p. 271). This is a flawed book and by no means at the forefront of current discussion. Its defects, however, may make it more accessible to traditional biblical scholars. It should make a substantial contribution to the growing awareness of the linguistic dimensions of the bible.

Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1981. viii-79 pp. $9.95 ($6.95 to members of the academy). The twin aims of this collection of essays are (1) to supplement the intense concentration of biblical studies upon time with a concentration rather upon space and (2) to provide "a meeting between biblical studies and the history of religions" (p. 5). Though there have been eras within the modern development of biblical scholarship when both these goals have received attention, Robert Cohn is quite correct in contending that he is here attempting something rather different from what standardly obtains in the study of the Bible. Even though an entire generation of biblical scholars at the turn of the century labeled themselves "die religionsgeschichtliche Schule," there has in fact been little work by students of the Bible which is truly informed by developments within 184</page></plain_text>
