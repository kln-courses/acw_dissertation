<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward a Typology of Religious Thought: A Chinese Example Lee H. Yearley Religious phenomena are often analyzed by means of the idea of types, but few typological analyses of religious thought exist. This situation is caused in large part by the independent development of "history of religions" and "theology" or the "philosophy of religion." Typological analyses of religious thought are possible, however. Moreover, they ought to aid the understanding of both the general religious phenome- non and the particular examples studied, as do such analyses in other areas. Analyzing types of religious thought as others have analyzed, say, types of religious communities, should achieve significant results. Any general typology of religious thought is impossible, or at least unwise, in the immediate future, but particular thinkers who exemplify different types can be examined. Such a process should cast light on both the thinker and the general question of types of religious thought.' The examination here centers on Mencius, the classical Confucian thinker (probable dates 371-289 B.C.E.). It aims to articulate the "prac- tical type" of-his religious thought, using his reflections upon the tradi- tional religious idea of the Heavenly Mandate (T'ien ming) as the primary example. This type becomes evident by analyzing the questions he answers and leaves unanswered, the intentions of his formulations, etc. The type deals with religious question in an unspeculative fashion because its orientation is to the transformation of human action. Men- cius manifests the type's characteristics particularly well because of cer- 1Literature on a typology of religious thought is not extensive, but fragmentary pointers do exist in some works. See, for example, G. van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manifestation, trans. J. E. Turner, 2 vols. (New York, 1963), secs. 17; 6o, chap. 1; 64; 72; 83; 84, chaps. 1-2; 85, chap. 1; 103; 104; orJoachim Wach's treatment in The Comparative Study of Religion, ed. J. M. Kitagawa (New York, 1958), PP- 59-96, The latter does not deal directly with the question but does make some relevant comments. An excellent recent study, though concerned only with India, is Frederick Streng, Emptiness: A Study in Religious Meaning (Nashville, Tenn., 1967). Also note the less successful, Ninian Smart, Reasons and Faith: An Investigation of Religious Discourse, Christian and Non-Christian (London, 1958). Incidentally, some questions treated here were first discussed in a paper delivered at the International Congress of Learned Societies in Religion, American Academy of Religion/Asian Religions Section, September 4, 1972. 426</page><page sequence="2">A Typology of Religious Thought tain distinctive aspects of both his view of man and his mode of thought.2 This approach to Mencius also points to an answer to the vexed ques- tion of whether pre-Han Confucian thought is purely philosophic, be- cause that thought shares certain characteristics with Mencius's thought. The thought of this period is often interpreted as just the philosophic pole of a movement "from religion to philosophy" similar to that some- times spoken of in classical Greece. It is often said to represent a genuine "enlightenment" that focused only on man and social questions, worked from "common sense," and consciously avoided distinctly religious ques- tions. The problem is real and perplexing. Examining the practical type of Mencius's religious thought, however, begins to show how this thought can be called religious, even if it fails to show characteristics found in other types of religious thought. This analysis, then, will expli- cate one type of religious thought and illuminate Mencius's thought, particularly its religious dimensions. Moreover, it will touch, if tangen- tially, on the larger, general questions of the typology of religious thought and the religious character of pre-Han Confucian thought.3 Our examination focuses on Mencius's reflections on the idea of the Heavenly Mandate. The idea's exact original meaning, usefulness to its promulgators, and complex historical development are complicated questions that we need not probe here.4 The necessary background for 21 call this type "practical" though it might also be called "ethical." "Practical" is used instead of "ethical" because "ethical" has various limited and ambiguous overtones today that make it unable to reflect adequately the full range of Mencius's meaning. (Inciden- tally, practical also has the advantage of productively complicating Wach's distinction among theoretical, practical, and sociological expressions of religion. Thought here deals less directly with speculative issues, but it is very closely linked to or formed by practice and community.) 3For those unfamiliar with Mencius, an excellent, brief, readily available introduction to his ideas is found in D. C. Lau, Mencius (Baltimore, 1970), pp. 7-46. References to the Mencius will use the Harvard-Yenching text number; e.g., 2A2 equals book 2 part A, section 2. (The basically uncorrupted nature of the text and its composition at least by disciples is assumed-see Lau, pp. 220-22.) All translations are from Lau's Mencius. (Some technical questions about Lau's translation of certain passages are dealt with in D. C. Lau, "Some Notes on the Mencius," Asia Major, n.s. 15, no. 1 [1969]: 62-81.) Also note the translations of James Legge, The Works of Mencius (New York, 1970); W. A. C. H. Dobson, Mencius (Toronto, 1963); and James Ware, The Sayings of Mencius (New York, 1960). Legge, originally published in 1895, shows its age at times but contains the Chinese and extensive notes. Dobson has renumbered the text, organizing it by topics, but a "finding list" is on pp. 209-15. Incidentally, points made here might be extrapolated to parts of the later Confucian tradition, but we shall restrict this examination to the pre-Han period. Difficulties as to the generality of these comments exist even there, however. Hsun Tzu, for instance, represents still another type of religious thought, though he shares some characteristics with Mencius, as later comments will briefly explain. For some illuminating general comments on modes of analysis in this period, see A. C. Graham, "The Place of Reason in the Chinese Philosophic Tradition," in The Legacy of China, ed. R. Dawson (Oxford, 1964), pp. 28-56. 4The Mandate of Heaven is, of course, a complex and critical idea. (I shall refer to the Heavenly Mandate as an "idea," though story/symbol/idea complex is more accurate.) As H. G. Creel in The Origins of Statecraft in China (Chicago, 1970), vol. i, says, it was "the cornerstone of the ideology of the Chinese state" (p. 44) and even "the central cohesive 427</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion our analysis can be briefly provided, however. The Chou dynasty's con- quest of the Shang dynasty brought with it the idea that Heaven (T'ien) caused, or at least validated, the conquest because of the religious and moral shortcomings of the Shang and accomplishments of the Chou. Simply seen, the story says that a powerful, good, "transcendent" figure takes the rule from one group and gives it to another, using goodness as the criterion for who should possess the rule. Indeed, the higher figure promises to shift the gift again should goodness fail in the designee and abound in another. The idea is many faceted. For example, it allows a conqueror to validate a conquest, but it also emphasizes a ruler's need to serve the people. Here, however, I should like to emphasize that the "original" story implies that Heaven has at least four attributes: (1) Heaven exhibits power and is able to overcome other powers in at least human affairs: (2) Heaven has some of those perfections we call per- sonal (i.e., will); (3) Heaven is concerned with and can effect at least certain human affairs at certain times; (4) Heaven is concerned with patterns of behavior, finding some favorable and others not; it is not amoral or immoral if human standards are used to measure it. The object the idea points to, then, is a Power with some form of the follow- ing four attributes: sovereignty (in at least human affairs), personality, effectiveness, and a valuing sense somewhat similar to man's.5 force binding together the entire Chinese people" (p. 94). Our concern here is not, how- ever, with the idea's whole history or even with the myriad problems surrounding its origin and evolution up to Mencius's time. The best single analysis of the latter problem is found in Creel, esp. pp. 81-ioo; pp. 51-52 briefly describe the traditional view of the idea, incidentally. For the major texts concerning the promulgation of the idea, see Homer H. Dubs, "The Archaic Royal Jou Religion," T'oung Pao 46 (1959): 2 18-59. For a discussion of the development of the idea that stresses the intellectual reflections on it and that makes occasional points of great interest, see T'ang Chiin-I, "The T'ien Ming (Heavenly Ordi- nance) in Pre-Ch'in China," Philosophy East and West 11/12 (1961/62): 195-218; 29-49. An interesting if odd examination of the idea's use in various pre-Han thinkers is found in Grancaelo Finazzo, The Principle of T'ien (Taipei, 1967). The relation to certain Western ideas, pointed out by Creel and T'ang Chfin-I, is clear, though, as they note, differences exist: e.g., an emphasis on serving the people, the mandate's dependence on virtue. See n. 22 below for further comments on the problem a "functional" view of the idea presents. Also note Creel's admittedly speculative theory of T'ien's original meaning; it is briefly put in Origins, p. 502 and argued at length on pp. 493-506. Numerous good points are made there, but its euhemeristic flavor makes me uneasy. 5The question of the character and power of other "major" gods is a vexing question where, to my knowledge, information is sparse. We do know, though, that the Duke of Chou established two altars, and evidence exists that at least this kind of duality extends through-and perhaps is expanded in-Mencius's period (see Joseph Shih, "The Notion of God in Ancient Chinese Religion," Numen 16/17 [1969/70]: 99-138). References to possible alternative sources of power are rarer in Mencius than in even the Analects, though there are a surprising number of at least allusions to sacrifice, including a famous one about altars to the gods of grain and earth (7B 14; see also 3A2, 3A3, 3B5, 4B25). This implies that whatever plurality may have been common to the culture Mencius's interest centers on either the one sovereign Power or, at least, the one Power sovereign in normal human affairs. Any such conclusion, however, is largely conjecture and is not intended to paint Mencius as a "monotheist," a label far too misleading to be useful. 428</page><page sequence="4">A Typology of Religious Thought This idea of Heaven's character and relation to the social process was important for many people in pre-Han China. But the idea's exact meaning, and even its truthfulness, becomes a problem. This is not surprising, as any such idea can only with some difficulty be harmonized with the normal ills of human existence, and this long period often showed more than just those normal ills. The idea of a Power concerned with the goodness of rulers, the justice of society, and the well-being of the common people is bound to be queried or attacked when bad rulers reign unhindered, or good rulers cannot maintain control, or, for what- ever reason, unjust societies continue to exist. Why, it will be and was asked, does Heaven allow the unjust to flourish and the innocent to suffer?6 Though Mencius, given the difficulties, might well have discarded the idea and avoided such problems, he does not. Despite the obvious difficulties of reconciling such an idea with the normal injustices in the world, despite a history of such questionings, he saw in the idea a reli- gious meaning that must be upheld, even if that meaning needed to be thought through in a new way. His thought, then, acquires a special character because of this notion's existence. This situation exemplifies how religious thinking often works on given elements and how it is often formed by given religious ideas that must be rethought but must not be discarded. Most important here, Mencius's rethinking of this idea ex- hibits the distinctive type of his religious thought. No coherent, systematic exposition of the Heavenly Mandate appears in Mencius-a fact itself of considerable import-but the almost thirty relevant references to the idea do fall into three general goupings. One group reflects the story's original meaning. Passages here concern the source of valid political authority: who is and is not a Heaven-appointed figure, what such figures can and cannot do, how one knows Heaven favors a person, etc. The references range from general comments about how a Heaven-appointed official can attack an evil state, through a statement that implies Heaven works on a set timetable to install sacred rulers, to a "historical" discussion of how Heavenly favor was exhibited in the past by the people's acceptance of a ruler and the spirit's accep- tance of sacrifices.' Here the focus is on "political" leadership and the validation of certain people or actions. The second group concerns Heaven as the source or cause of human nature. Widening the scope of Heaven's effects, it also implies, in most cases, a lessened sense of Heaven's direct, willed action. Although Heaven is described as the source of even man's body and complexion, the emphasis is on Heaven's causation of those qualities, like benevo- 6For some especially powerful examples of this questioning see Shih ching: 2:4; 7, 5-6; 2:4; 10,1, 2:5; 4,1; 3:3; 10,1,6. 7See 2B8, 2A5, 7A19, 2B13, 5A5-5A7, 5Bi. 429</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion lence and righteousness, that constitute human nature's distinguishing characteristics. Here, benevolence (jen) is spoken of as the highest dig- nity conferred by Heaven, or knowledge of one's nature is said to be knowledge of Heaven.8 This group reveals a set of complex ideas and raises a set of complex questions because here one is at the very center of Mencius's religious vision. This vision's axial point is the internalization of sacred power, its view that sacral action is action that accords with what is most natural to one. We cannot examine the ramifications of this view, though some aspects will become clearer later. For now let us just note that the experience of human goodness as a gift given by a separate power finds theoretic expression in ascribing that goodness to Heaven's causation.9 The third group views Heaven as that power either responsible for, or at least the source of, all those unalterable conditions beyond man's control that define the limits of the human situation. Structures of exis- tence, like human nature, are part of this group, but the main concern is with those external occurrences over which man has no control. Some passages in this group just illustrate a rather nonreflective acceptance of circumstances, an acceptance where meaning is neither clearly discerned nor perhaps even sought. The reference here is to an attitude to situa- tions like that covered by such a phrase as "that's the way things are." Other references, however, reflect the idea that a higher purpose is evident, even if its outline is only vaguely understood. Interpretative difficulties surround these statements, as will be discussed shortly, but such statements do make up a third group. One example is the state- ment that Heaven causes those who are to be great to suffer. Another is the idea that "when a man goes forward [toward significant events] there is something which urges him on; when he halts, there is something which holds him back. It is not in his power either to go forward or to halt. It is due to Heaven." A third is the comment that "when a thing is 8See 7A38, 2A2, 2A6, 2A7, 6A6, 6Ai4-6A16, 7A 1-7A4 7B24, The question of the more philosophic aspects of Mencius's notion of human nature is brilliantly dealt with in an article by A. C. Graham ("The Background of the Mencian Theory of Human Nature," Tsing Hua Journal of Chinese Studies, n.s. 6-1-2 [1967]: 214-71). On this general ques- tion, two articles by D. C. Lau are also very helpful (see "On Mencius' Use of Analogy in Argument," Asia Major, n.s. 12 [1963]: 173-194; and "Theories of Human Nature in Mencius and Shyuntzyy," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 15 [1953]: 541-65). Donald Munro's study of the general question in this period is also excellent (see his The Concept of Man in Early China [Stanford, Calif., 1969]). 9The religious ramifications of this view are many. Mencius accepts, or reorders, or transmutes a variety of elements in certain of China's religious traditions around this center. See, for example, the emphasis that all men, not just the sacral king, mediate Heaven to Earth by providing the means for Heaven's incarnation of itself (7AI3); the view of texts that both recognizes their importance and yet allows for a certain freedom in use (see 7B3 on the latter point); and the portrait of the founding figure's importance (the concluding sections of 2A2). 430</page><page sequence="6">A Typology of Religious Thought done though by no one, then it is the work of Heaven; when a thing comes about though no one brings it about, then it is decreed."10 The exposition of the Heavenly Mandate is clearly unsystematic. Most important, however, certain critical theoretical questions about the character and action of Heaven are left unanswered. These questions are best crystallized by looking at two places where Heaven's relation to the contemporary chaotic and unjust social situation is discussed. In one, Mencius, apparently unhappy at his political failure, says "it must be that Heaven does not as yet wish to bring peace to the Empire. If it did, who is there in the present time other than myself? Why should I be un- happy?" In the other, he declares, "when the Way prevails in the Empire men of small virtue serve men of great virtue, men of small ability serve men of large ability. But when the Way is in disuse, the small serve the big, the weak serve the strong. Both are due to Heaven. Those who are obedient to Heaven are preserved; those who go against Heaven are annihilated.""1 In the first Mencius states that Heaven must not wish to bring peace to society as he, who alone could do it, remains unsuccessful. In the second, he states that both the Way in use and the Way in disuse are due to Heaven. The clear implication of these statements is that good government, with a consequent alleviation of suffering, could exist, but that bad government persists. Most important, they imply that Heaven allows the bad situation to continue though it is able to generate the good. The dilemma put starkly is that a Heaven that allows or causes men to suffer must then be a power that cannot or will not help. If the power cannot help, its power is limited; if it will not help, its goodness is limited. Someone familiar with Western religious thought recognizes the di- lemma as a form of the problem of theodicy and thinks the problem is penetrable only if certain abstract questions are investigated. For exam- '06B15, 1B16, 5A6; also see iB14, 4A7, 5A8. A clear example of the interpretative difficulties appears in comparing 6B15 and 7Ai8. Is Mencius saying that Heaven causes men to suffer in order to test and build their goodness, or that good men grow through suffering? The former appears the main thrust of 6B15, but in 7Ai8 the latter point is made without reference to Heaven. The second statement (IBi6) has the setting of a duke's failure to come to Mencius because an official spoke against him. The point is that it "is due to Heaven" that he "failed to meet the Marquis of Lu. How can this fellow Tsang [the official] be responsible for my failure?" (Note the spareness of the especially relevant material in the original: nothing more than T'ien yeh.) The third statement (5A6) concerns the question of succession as manifested in "early history" and would fit in the first group save for the generality of the comment. A few other relevant texts (e.g., "Heaven ap- pointed weather") neither fit neatly into these three categories nor are important enough to make a new one (see 2B1, iBio [though not from Mencius's mouth] and perhaps 6A16, 7A20). Shih has attempted a different and far more detailed breakdown of relevant pas- sages that I find helpful but finally unconvincing (Vincent Y. C. Shih, "Metaphysical Tendencies in Mencius, " Philosophy East and West 12, no. 4 [1963]: 319-41; see esp. the opening section). 112B13, 4A7, cf. 1B16, 5A8. 431</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion ple, one must determine the character and causal relation of the ele- ments involved by asking a series of abstract questions: What are the exact qualities distinguishing, say, man and Heaven? What kind of cau- sation might characterize their relation? What theory of knowledge un- derlies statements about either entity? Western literature on this prob- lem or its cognates (grace and free will, providence and predestination, the origin of evil) are filled with such questions. Indeed, such analyses often constitute the substance of these traditions' religious thought. Mencius, however, fails to pose such questions, and, examing why they are not posed, leads, I think, to comprehending the type of his religious thought. That is, Mencius does not pose such questions because he rep- resents a type of religious thinking where abstract questions are not pursued, but the issues are dealt with in a different manner, with differ- ent goals in mind. Before investigating that type, however, two other possible explana- tions for the failure to pose such questions need to be examined. The first would argue that the dilemma posed by the theodicy question is solved by being, in effect, dissolved. Mencius, like Hsfin Tzu, just elimi- nates value and will from Heaven and therefore is left with no problem. Mencius has been read from this perspective, but he does not, I think, eliminate those attributes of Heaven which make possible a dissolution of the problem. Rather, as we saw, he maintains that Heaven's actions are visible in the political sphere, that Heaven can be spoken of as caus- ing moral qualities, and that Heaven's actions can be seen in certain events in people's lives.12 The second explanation argues that Mencius was just "naive," that such questions had simply not dawned on him because they were too sophisticated. Clearly, such questions were not as much a part of his intellectual milieu as they would have been for, say, a thirteenth-century Jewish, Christian, or Islamic thinker in the West. Indeed, this explana- tion has some plausibility. The times neither highlighted this problem nor furnished the technical vocabulary to treat such questions. Nevertheless, the "theodicy problem" is an evident one. Moreover, it had been raised, if in rudimentary form, by earlier questions about Heaven's action in the political sphere and by later discussions of fatalism-indeed 12See, for example, Burton Watson, trans., Hsiin Tzu; Basic Writings (New York, 1963), pp. 79-88. Put one way, the problem is how seriously to take the anthropomorphic lan- guage about Heaven that appears in the Mencius. Passages like 5A5 militate against stress- ing it, and one might argue that some other passages (e.g., 7A1) use Heaven to give a rhetorical color or force to certain "naturalistic" ideas. Numerous other passages, however, clearly declare or imply that Heaven has attributes like acting, favoring, caring, or willing (e.g., 1B16, 5A6, even 5A5 under one reading). These passages invalidate any simple picture of Mencius's Heaven as a "pattern" or "structure" or "machine." Dropping out the anthropomorphic aspect of Mencius's Heaven thins the complex texture of his presenta- tion. Certain crucial notions are excised and the meaning of other ideas is changed considerably. 432</page><page sequence="8">A Typology of Religious Thought such discussions in Mohist hands became a criticism of "Confucian" ideas. Mencius's overlooking of speculative questions is not a mere func- tion of, or fully explainable by, "cultural naivete." The intellectual envi- ronment made such high-level speculation unlikely, but the reasons for Mencius's not asking these questions is more than the simple result of cultural possibility. It also exhibits a specific type of religious thought. That is, Mencius's failure to pose such questions shows us something important about both himself and one type of religious thought.13 Put quite generally, this type of religious thinking aims neither to work at abstract problems, unless they result in immediate religious actions, nor to resolve certain basic intellectual tensions. Rather this type is guided by a concern for the direct religious usefulness of whatever is thought about and the desire actually to maintain rather than probe certain basic tensions. The aims of guiding action and of upholding apparently conflicting poles are the distinctive marks of this type of religious thought. To take up the latter mark first. Religious thought may often be most religious-most fully aware of its distinctive subject matter-when it sees itself faced with what I shall call "irresolvable but revelatory and pro- ductive tensions." These tensions are constituted by two different but related ideas that stand as the irreducible givens on which reflection works, the undeniable poles that form the two sides of its vision of reality. In Mencius various polarities are evident. For example, at one pole the notion of a human potential whose realization depends on each individual's effort; at the other, the notion of a sovereign power beyond man that creates the potential but also seems, in some way, to control and even frustrate its completion in most or all men. Other examples are the tension between service to self and service to community; the tension between the availability of adequate moral guidance and the failure of men to follow it; the tension between the idea that potentially all men are independent, moral agents and the idea that potentially only certain men are independent, moral agents and they must govern other men, who are capable only of being led to goodness. Because both sides of the tension must be upheld, any resolution that even diminishes either side must be rejected. Moreover, because seeing both sides is revelatory and productive, a resolution need not even be sought. In fact, keeping the '3See, for example, Burton Watson, trans., Mo Tzu: Basic Writings (New York, 1963), pp. 78-93; 117-23; 126-27. Incidentally, I do not mean to imply that numerous questions were clearly before Mencius's mind and then quite self-consiciously put aside. Put another way, one can simply argue that Mencius's thinking is sloppy. That is, the random attribu- 'tions of anthropomorphic characteristics to Heaven are just examples of Mencius's not seeing contradictions, or not being precise enough, or not following out the main thrust of his thought. This approach would argue that here, as elsewhere, Hsun Tzu clears up inconsistencies and solves "problems" in Mencius's thought. That explanation's cogency is clear, but I am arguing for the possibility of another explanation of this "sloppiness." 433</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion tension's irresolvability in mind, developing a tolerance for such percep- tions may be of considerable religious significance in making clear one's relation to the sacred. Indeed, to speculate for a moment, a key to understanding the thought of many religious traditions may be discovering their "irresolv- able but revelatory and productive tensions"; those poles around which they work, emphasizing one side here, another there, perhaps sure a resolution exists but most clear that both poles must be maintained. The Christian arguments on Christ's two natures or the anattalkarma question in Buddhism may exemplify this. These problems remain unsolved for the "mainline" of those traditions because any solution always voids what is religiously most important, the existence of both poles. The degree of tenison will always, however, depend upon the overall perspective of the tradition or thinker. For example, Kierkegaard's emphasis on "the Paradox" arises from his general ideas about the distinction between God and man. Aquinas treats similar paradoxes quite differently be- cause his general view of the divine/human relationship is so different. And Mencius, who has still another view of the distinction between the human and transhuman sphere, will treat the tensions still differently. However intense or moderate the overall perspective makes the ten- sions, their existence, nevertheless, remains a crucial part of religious thought.14 This religious need to uphold tensions helps explain, then, why cer- tain questions aimed at resolving the theodicy problem are not asked by Mencius. But certain questions also remain unasked because religious problems are treated only if they have implications for behavior and are worked through only in light of their consequences for behavior. Ques- tions are analyzed only if, and only so far as, thinking about them helps generate correct action. Not the problem and its solution, but the life to be lived animates this type of religious thought. The general approach is made especially clear in the following passage: Is the maker of arrows really more unfeeling than the maker of armour? He is afraid lest he should fail to harm people, whereas the maker of armour is afraid lest he should fail to protect them. The case is similar with the sorcerer-doctor and the coffinmaker. For this reason one cannot be too careful in the choice of one's calling. Confucius said, "The best neighbourhood is where benevolence is to be found. Not to live in such a neighbourhood when one has the choice cannot by any 14For an example of how this general idea might be worked out in relation to current Anglo-Saxon philosophic ideas and Christian theological beliefs, see Austin Farrer's notion of religious language as the art of balancing strangely contrasted parables or ideas (Reflective Faith, ed. C. Conti [London, 1973], PP. 114-18). For an interesting treatment of three general polarities in Confucian thought see Benjamin Schwartz, "Some Polarities in Confucian Thought," in Confucianism in Action, ed. D. Nivison and A. Wright (Stanford, Calif. 1959), PP. 50-62. Conversations with David Nivison, an editor of that volume, have aided my thinking on tensions in Mencius as well as other points. 434</page><page sequence="10">A Typology of Religious Thought means be considered wise." Benevolence is the high honour bestowed by Heaven and the peaceful abode of man. Not to be benevolent when nothing stands in the way is to show a lack of wisdom. A man neither benevolent or wise, devoid of courtesy and dutifulness, is a slave. A slave ashamed of serving is like a maker of bows ashamed of making bows, or a maker of arrows ashamed of making arrows. If one is ashamed, there is no better remedy than to practice benevolence. Benevolence is like archery: an archer makes sure his stance is correct before letting fly the arrow, and if he fails to hit the mark, he does not hold it against his victor. He simply seeks the cause within himself.15 The passage may appear to lack both coherent development and evident meaning, but it contains a "logic" that exemplifies the practical type of Mencius's religious thought. Mencius asks if one can be a good man in bad profession; that is, as a coffin maker or maker of arrows, who lives from death, rather than a sorcerer-doctor or maker of armor, who lives from life. He raises, if you will, the religious problem of "vocation." He responds not with an extended speculative analysis of the different as- pects of the question, but with a general principle (" the best neighbor- hood is where benevolence is to be found") followed by two general directives about the application of the principle. First, he notes that circumstances ("nothing stands in the way") will determine choice. For example, making arrows when one's country is attacked by a barbaric power is different from making arrows in peacetime. Second, he argues that, for a properly nurtured person, shame will determine if the deci- sion is correct. A specific, internal response arising from a movement of one's nature is the final guide to the rightness of choice. The sense of shame, then, is a sure and specific guide to the correct answer to the particular question faced. If one has properly nurtured one's nature and achieved skill in reading its movements, the response is trustworthy because shame arises from the nature Heaven has given man. Indeed, shame is one of the four constituents of that nature, one of the four germs that define human nature; it is the potential whose actualization is righteousness (yi).'" Rather than an abstract analysis of the problem of 152A7. One may query "calling" as an adequate translation of shu in the last sentence of the first paragraph and, from that, raise questions about my general interpretation. Either "calling" or Legge's "profession" reinforces my point about the question of "vocation," but even a more literal "craft" (Ware)-or even "method or "art of doing something"-does not undercut the point. (Indeed, the last would reinforce my point about the mode of Mencius's response.) Dobson, seeing a pun, translates shu as "doctrine one follows," and this would create difficulties for my reading. His reasons for doing so, however, are not fully convincing to me (see his Mencius, p. 134 and his explanation on p. 2o6). 16The exact meaning of "shame" in Mencius is a vexing question. Generally, it is the sense of falling short of some standard, a repugnance at the acts of self or others, that finds its realization in yi (see 2A6, 6A6). But one wonders if it is more like shame or more like guilt-if indeed that distinction itself is really helpful; is it more like "honor" as Aristotle uses that word, or like "conscience" as the Western Christian tradition since the fifteenth century uses that word? Moreover, are the actualizations, yi and chih, and therefore their germs "shame" and the approving and disapproving of certain acts, to be differentiated on 435</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion vocation, the passage shows a general principle, a notation of the impor- tance of circumstances to proper decision, and the exhortation to let one's Heavenly-given good nature guide one by means of its response of shame. Indeed, the final exhortation may even imply that one ought to be busy with the self-nurture that leads to a proper sense of shame rather than wasting time by engaging in the close, intellectual analysis of the general problem of vocation. Other passages, more directly concerned with reflection on the Heavenly Mandate, also clearly show the type's characteristics. For ex- ample, the following difficult and much-discussed passage is best under- stood as exemplifying the practical type of religious thought: The way the mouth is disposed towards tastes, the eyes towards colours, the ear towards sounds, the nose towards smells, and the four limbs towards ease is human nature, yet therein also lies the Decree. That is why the gentleman does not describe it as nature. The way benevolence pertains to the relation between father and son, duty to the relation between prince and subject, the rites to the relation between guest and host, wisdom to the good and wise man, the sage to the Way of Heaven, is the Decree, but therein also lies human nature. That is why the gentleman does not describe it as Decree.17 This exposition seems less an attempt to solve the intellectual problem of the exact meaning and relation of nature (hsing) and mandate (ming) than an attempt to instruct men how to think about them so that ap- propriate attitudes and thus behavior arise. The desire is to persuade and guide rather than explain; problems are to be worked at only in- sofar as explanation serves to guide man toward proper religious growth and action. Similarly, the thrust of passages which counsel viewing be- nevolence (jen) as the highest honor bestowed by Heaven or recognizing that the thinking heart (hsin) is Heaven's special gift to man, guide men to see that benevolence or the heart must be honored.'" Recognizing or the grounds that the latter only distinguishes among acts, while the former contains an imperative to act? That is, is the difference like that between reading about a murder in the newspaper and knowing it is wrong (chih), and seeing one attempted before one's eyes and being compelled to act (yi)? 177B24; cf. 6Ai6. The interpretation of this passage is problematic-Graham's reading remains the most satisfactory to my mind (see Graham, pp. 241-42). This passage also raises the general question if ming, when used in a context like this, may have no relation to ming, when used in conjunction with Heaven. The question is difficult to answer because Mencius does not systematically analyze the problems-in the language of this article, the practical type of his thought means certain questions remain unanalyzed. I am, however, arguing that ming as fate/destiny/decree/ ordinance or whatever can almost always be read as having some connection with Heaven; at least in the sense that my third group of references in Mencius refers to a "higher purpose" however vaguely that be understood. (Clearly, incidentally, certain references to Heaven [e.g., 2B1] do not directly refer to the Heavenly Mandate concept.) This question ties to the problems raised in n. io above and nn. 19 and 21 below and the later discussion of the known and unknown mandate. "8See 2A7; 6AI5. 436</page><page sequence="12">A Typology of Religious Thought "looking on" them as from Heaven produces a view which generates correct action. The approach is also clearly reflected in expositions relating to the "theodicy problem;" that is, to situations where senseless suffering's oc- currence, or good men's failure, seems to mean that Heaven validates an improper state of affairs. The three passages that open the seventh book exemplify this: For a man to give full realization to his heart is for him to understand his own nature, and a man who knows his own nature will know Heaven. By retaining his heart and nurturing his nature he is serving Heaven. Whether he is going to die young or to live to a ripe old age makes no difference to his steadfastness of purpose. It is through awaiting whatever is to befall him with a perfected charac- ter that he stands firm on his proper destiny. Though nothing happens that is not due to destiny, one accepts willingly only what is one's proper destiny. That is why he who understands destiny does not stand under a wall on the verge of collapse. He who dies after having done his best in following the Way dies according to his proper destiny. It is never anyone's proper destiny to die in fetters. Seek and you will get it; let go and you will lose it. If this is the case, then seeking is of use to getting and what is sought is within yourself. But if there is a proper way to seek it and whether you get it or not depends on destiny, then seeking is of no use to getting and what is sought lies outside yourself.'9 These passages emphasize that in those areas the theodicy question covers, as elsewhere, man's primary business is to search within himself to discover the good to be done. If this search is joined with reasonable caution, certain misfortunes are avoided and others recognized as clearly beyond one's control and therefore to be accepted as decreed. In effect, Mencius distinguishes a "known" and "unknown" Mandate and suggests man focus on the known one shown by human nature. Seeking to penetrate the unknown Mandate-to understand why Heaven allows the unjust to thrive, for instance-focuses attention improperly. One ought to seek to understand and follow its knowable partner; the com- mands of human nature that benevolence is to be sought, the thinking heart put in the primary place, etc. The actions called for by this known Mandate are clear enough to provide all the guidance needed for reli- gious development. Moreover, the difficulty in understanding the un- known one can easily engage all one's energy and thereby undermine the essential religious task of self-development. Frustrating external circumstances are to be accepted, not analyzed as 197A1-7A3; 7A4 carries this forward in its statement that "all the ten thousand things are there in me." See also 1B14, 1B16, 5A8, 2A4. 7A 1-7A4 is as vexing a set of passages as the Mencius contains. The use of ming'in 7A1-7A3 is particularly perplexing. It is best approached, I think, by means of the "known/unknown" mandate idea, though the ques- tions raised in n. 21 below must also be answered if a full explication is to be given. 437</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion to their exact relation to the Heavenly Mandate. That acceptance, how- ever, rests on the belief that such circumstances reflect purpose, not on the idea that no choice but acceding is possible. That is, one believes significant purpose informs the unknown Mandate's action even if one cannot understand it. The attitude Mencius points to here is somewhat difficult to imagine. It refers to a state between the more normal ones of seeing either meaning or lack of meaning in external events. Such a third state, however, is not, I think, an uncommon one for religious people, although understanding it may present complex problems. Men may think purpose exists in events and therefore act in distinctive ways, even if they think the purpose is fundamentally unfathomable. The exact character and possible cogency of such attitudes may raise compli- cated questions, but that such attitudes do exist is clear-indeed' they may even contain many of the more profound manifestations of the religious spirit. The distinction between a known and unknown Mandate when joined to a practically directed type of religious thought establishes a framework for deciding both what is to be carefully considered and how that consideration should proceed. The practical problem remains of knowing exactly which external circumstances to accept passively, but human nature gives enough knowledge to guide action. Perplexing ex- ternal occurrences are viewed as occasions for action rather than reflection. The problem of theodicy, then, is left unprobed because the aim of religious thought is the formation of attitude, character, and action, rather than the solving of abstract religious questions. Enough guidance exists to solve the crucial practical problems men face, and only that guidance is-necessary. The integrity of this approach is, I think, clear. Aristotle, in the Nichomachean Ethwcs, remarked that the goal of ethical study lay in the actions engendered and people formed, rather than in the analysis itself. The same may surely be said for religious thought, indeed it may be particularly true if it must always deal with "irreducible but revelatory and productive tensions" in its abstractions. If the salvatory transforma- tion of man is religion's goal and basic polar tensions characterize its most significant insights, then forming religious language with the aim of guiding and persuading is not only defensible but even especially congenial to the subject of religion. Moreover, if, as much modern philosophical analysis of languages argues, language produces or reflects a specific orientation and certain kind of life (so that to imagine a language is to imagine a way of life), then to clarify a language is to clarify a way of life. That is, making appropriate distinctions and definitions is to aid or even generate correct action because correct use of language is constitutive of correct action. From this perspective, this type of religious thought attempts, by means of the rectification of 438</page><page sequence="14">A Typology of Religious Thought names, to create a language that will save. It aims to generate a language that forms proper attitudes, correct orientations, and appropriate actions.20 This attempt is especially feasible if one believes, as Mencius did, that man is potentially all he must be. Because man knows implicitly all he needs to know, and because right action will follow from right knowl- edge, his knowledge must only be triggered by proper language and right example for goodness to come. Particularly given Mencius's overall view, the integrity of this mode of thinking can be defended. Indeed, this aspect of Mencius's thought makes him the clearest exemplification of the practical type I know. Although the type is represented in, say, Christianity's "pastorally oriented" theological tradition, the type is less clear there because of the focus on sacred writings and revealed law, the maintenance of some form of the ideal of theoretic contemplation, the sense of man's sinfulness, etc. Saying.this brings up, of course, the problem of the religiosity of Mencius's thought, the question of the aptness of a phrase like "salvatory transformation" when the knowledge of and capacity for the desired state is innate. When set in this context the intricacies of the problem are manifold. They reach, for example, to the basic conundrum of Mencius's affirming both that human nature is good and that human actions are often bad. This, in turn, leads to a set of questions about the relation of knowledge and action, the character of mind and its effort, the role of attention and its extension, etc. The range of questions can- not be examined here, but clearly the character of this salvatory trans- formation is different from those probably more familiar cases where external aid is necessary, or man is changed to a fundamentally different state. Nevertheless, this process of "going after the strayed heart" does involve a transformation of what man normally is, even if that transfor- mation is a recovery of what he "really" is.21 20See Streng, p. 178, for a statement on the general "practical" character of religious thought; his general argument develops the notion at length. The application of certain modern analytic notions, particularly the notion of performative utterances, to Confucius is made by Herbert Fingarette in his Confucius--the Secular as Sacred (New York, 1972). The results are mixed, but the general question of rectification of names receives an interesting treatment (see pp. 14-15). (Donald D. Evans's notion of "onlooks" is also a potentially powerful interpretative tool here; see his The Logic of Self-Involvement [New York, 1969] pp. 125-35; esp. 249-52.) 21See 6A11 on "going after the strayed heart." The whole of 6A concerns this problem, but also see the example of this process at iA7, and note 2A2, 4Alo, A412, 4BI4, 4Bi8, 4B19, 4B28, 7A16, 7A44, 7B31, 7B35, 7B37, 7B39. These questions are too complicated to investigate here, but note that they become both particularly vexing and especially interesting if they are set in the context 6f Western philosophic debates on "weakness of will." These debates enable one to both clarify the question's different aspects and raise important comparative issues. For a sketch of various aspects of this debate, see the essays in G. W. Mortimore, ed., Weakness of Will (London, 1971). This problem and the more general one of this perspective's religiosity extend, of course, through much of the Confu- cian tradition. 439</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion One general question about this type's character and integrity still remains however. Does this analysis, in effect, say that Mencius's (or this type's) thinking works only to propagate useful fictions? Did Mencius lack the honesty to say, or perhaps insight to recognize, that most reli- gious ideas serve a necessary function but are "untrue"? The query can be made from either of two "functionalist" perspectives, one exemplified by Hsin Tzu, the other by the modern sociological analysis of C. K. Yang.22 Yang's functional, sociological exposition views the idea of a transcendent purpose, sanction, or source as a way of enforcing desired or socially necessary behavior, of reinforcing those actions that, for whatever reasons, a society desires. The idea of the Mandate of Heaven provides an excellent laboratory for such an approach. The historical circumstances of the Mandate's original proclamation-conquest, re- gency, the introduction of new religious ideas and social forms-provide materials for a clear functional reading. More important here, the idea's continuance can be viewed in terms of its enabling people to cope with extreme difficulty by engendering a significant kind of resignation that allows men both to continue living and to act "properly." This analysis causes few difficulties if one views the approach as simply not raising the question of whether more than a social reality is involved-Yang, for instance, never really explores that question. Difficulties do arise, however, if a full explication is intended. Indeed, one encounters the massive problem of just what constitutes a full ex- planation of some of man's most complex experiences. Hsfin Tzu's analysis raises this problem in a most striking fashion. In an explanation of extraordinary subtlety and brilliance, he denies religious ideas are true as referring to some absolute but affirms they are true as being necessary to the life of that being called man. When illuminated by the harsh brilliance of Hsiin Tzu, the full ramifications of the question are too complex to discuss here. It is clear, however, that Mencius's emphasis on the formation of character always works in the service of what he understood to be the religiously real or true. He neither looked to an 22See C. K. Yang, Religion in Chinese Society (Berkeley, 1967), esp. pp. 127-43. (Aspects of I. A. Richards's account in Mencius on the Mind: Experiments in Multiple Definitions [Lon- don, 1932] also show this perspective and Creel's analysis moves in that direction; see n. 4 above.) The clearest examples of this point in Hsiin Tzu are contained in sections 17 and i9. See Noah Fehl, Rites and Propriety in Literature and Life: Ancient China (Hong Kong, 1971), pp. 151-212, for a general discussion of Hsiin Tzu that does not articulate the ideas I am emphasizing here but does set a background for them. The overall questions here are, of course, massive ones. The less vexing ones are well discussed in Hans H. Penner, "The Poverty of Functionalism," History of Religions 2, no. 1 (1971): 91-97. Some more critical ones are well set in Van Harvey's treatment of Peter Berger's work ("Some Prob- lematical Aspects of Peter Berger's Theory of Religion,"Journal of the American Academy of Religions 40, no. 1 [March 1973]: 75-93), though the critical kinds of problems Hsuin Tzu presents remain basically untouched. 440</page><page sequence="16">A Typology of Religious Thought idea's functional effectiveness in maintaining social life nor sees, like Hsiin Tzu, a world where men are forced by their divided natures to think or act in ways that the wiser of them know to be accommodations to frailty. Rather he believed that at various points in various ways -through the germs of his nature, the flood like ch'i-he touched a unified, harmonious reality whose truth underlay his attempts to form character. The practical mode of his religious thought is formulated in light of what he saw as real. The preceding has outlined a particular type of religious thought and examined Mencius in relation to it. Hopefully, it illuminates both the type and Mencius. Various questions string out from this examination, however. Clearly, for example, other aspects of Mencius's thinking (like his analysis of the character and source of "will") need to be analyzed in a similar fashion, just as the relation of his brief, suggestive mode of speech or dialogic approach to the type needs to be clarified.23 More generally, however, two very important questions remain. One is the question of developing a general theory of types of sophis- ticated religious thought. Comments here can only present a kind of prototheory, can only be mere forerunners of more adequate frameworks, but they may serve to point directions and to clarify my critic's ideas. Four types are evident to me. They can be briefly described by noting how each describes the "ultimate" and by mentioning one or more examples. The first, with Nagarjuna and probably the Chuang Tzu as examples, is the attempt through theoretic reflection to recognize language and thus "reality's" lack of ultimate referent.24 The second rests on the notion of both a contingent and a necessary realm, focuses on their relation, and sees normal language and thought as in some sense able to describe the higher sphere. Those Western traditions influenced by Aristotle exemplify this, with Aquinas's doctrine and utili- zation of analogy being perhaps the clearest example.25 A third "func- tionalist" type is exemplified by Hsiin Tzu and perhaps some modern Christian thinkers. As noted, it denies the reference to an absolute but 23See, for example, 2A2; 7B25; 4B26; iA7. 24Streng's Emptiness, which analyzes Nigdrjuna, develops this type admirably. The Chuang Tzu contains, of course, massive interpretative and textual problems, but for two works that illustrate the perspective on that work I am pointing to, see A. C. Graham, "Chuang Tzu's Essay on Seeing Things as Equal," History of Religions 9 (1969/70): 137-59; and Lars Jul Hansen, "An Analysis of 'Autumn Floods' in Chuang Tzu," in Invitation to Chinese Philosophy, ed. A. Naess and A. Hannay (Oslo, 1972), pp. 113-40. 25For examples of the possibilities and difficulties the idea presents see Summa Theologiae, I, 21, 3 and 4; 22; 23, 1, 3, 4, 6. For a traditional exposition of analogy that emphasizes its ontological character, see E. L. Mascall, Existence and Analogy (London, 1949), PP. 92-121. For one set in terms of language analysis, see James Ross's article, "Analogy as a Rule of Meaning for Religious Language," in Aquinas, ed. A. Kenny (Garden City, N.Y., 1969), pp. 93-138. 441</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion affirms the necessity of religious ideas to the life of man.26 The fourth, examined here, is the "practical" type which aims not at problem solving but rather at maintaining significant polar tensions and guiding man's salvatory transformation. Other types exist, no doubt, but these four seem clear to me. Analyzing their characteristics, seeing how they func- tion and relate, is an important and exciting task. A second general question moves unblushingly, if hesitantly, from descriptive to normative problems, from questions of how Mencius and others do think about religion, to questions of how one ought to think about religion. We need to face the challenge and opportunity Mencius's type of thought presents (though, as mentioned, the type is particularly viable because of Mencius's general view). The traditions most of us work from usually take an approach that both challenges and is chal- lenged by Mencius. Those traditions assume, for example, that exposi- tions with precisely made distinctions aid human life. Clearly such analyses are useful. For example, Aristotle's distinctions among friend- ships of the pleasant, useful, and good do bring an understanding that helps guide action. Moreover, some form of the idea that the least knowledge of a higher realm is more important than the fullest knowl- edge of a lower one does lead to emphasizing the need for theoretic speculation, and such speculation has been important. It has led to perhaps the West's most distinctive and formative-if also most ques- tionable-religious idea: deity's aseity. (Theoretic speculation with, say, Ndgarjuna also led to a religious idea of overwhelming importance.) Such notions or such discriminations cannot arise from Mencius's ap- proach, but Mencius does challenge back. He forces us to face a variety of questions: for example, to recognize the peculiarity of the activity, particularly in a religious context, of contemplating abstract questions; to realize the disjunction of this type of thinking from other religious activities; to probe how exactly men do think about religious problems, 26A strikingly clear example of this is Hsiin Tzu's discussion of rites (sec. 19), especially the death rites. Understanding all aspects of Hsiin Tzu's view of rites presents difficult problems, but most important here is the exposition of them as a set of ideas and actions that overcome the split between knowing the person has died and initially being "emotion- ally" unable to accept that fact. This analysis exemplifies that "revolution by redefinition or reinterpretation" this type represents. (In the Watson translation of the Hsiin Tzu see esp. pp. 103-6; note that only the sage fully understands their meaning [p. 1 io].) Incidentally, light is cast on the relation between Mencius and Hsiin Tzu by recognizing that their disagreements are, in part, disagreements as to the correct mode of religious thought. It is worthwhile relating this scheme to Streng's Emptiness, though he is concerned only with India, as his book is both excellent and influential. Streng's "dialectic" clearly fits the first, while his "intuition" relates to the second, although the Aristotelian tradition sets a proba- bly more sophisticated and in many ways quite different model. His mythic realm-which uses language to "create reality"-is excised here because it lacks the theoretic sophistica- tion to ask even a set of rudimentary questions. The possibility exists, however, that reformulating in it terms of some version of the idea of "performative utterances" might make it yet another type. 442</page><page sequence="18">A Typology of Religious Thought like senseless suffering, when actually faced with them; to face the evi- dent aberrations speculation may involve, like the satisfaction of mere curiosity or the reliance on abstract formulations. In focusing on the formation of men, the power of evocation, the maintenance of basic tensions, Mencius throws up a profound, alternative view of the process of religious thought. These two questions allow for no easy answers. Both do show, how- ever, the importance of an investigation of the general question of types of religious thought. The paper begins, I think, an important kind of investigation. I hope now, to reformulate a comment from Confucius's Analects (7, 8), that having held up one corner others may come back with the remaining three. 443</page></plain_text>
