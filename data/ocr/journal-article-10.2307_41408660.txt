This study investigated the biological effects and adaptive responses induced by single and repeated in vivo computed tomography (CT) scans. We postulated that, through the induction of low-level oxidative stress, repeated low-dose CT scans (20 mGy, 2 days/week, 10 weeks) could protect mice (C57BL/6) from acute effects of high-dose radiation (1 Gy, 2 Gy). The micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) count increased linearly after exposure to single CT scans of doses ranging from 20 to 80 mGy ( P = 0.033). Ten weeks of repeated CT scans (total dose 400 mGy) produced a slight reduction in spontaneous MN-RET levels relative to levels in sham CT- scanned mice (P = 0.04). Decreases of nearly 10% in y-H2AX fluorescence levels were observed in the repeated CT-scanned mice after an in vitro challenge dose of 1 Gy (P = 0.017) and 2 Gy (P = 0.026). Spontaneous apoptosis levels (caspase 3 and 7 activation) were also significantly lower in the repeated CT- scanned mice than the sham CT-scanned mice (P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, mice receiving only a single CT scan showed a 19% elevation in apoptosis ( P &lt; 0.02) and a 10% increase in y- H2AX fluorescence levels after a 2-Gy challenge (P &lt; 0.05) relative to sham CT controls. Overall, repeated CT scans seemed to confer resistance to larger doses in mice, whereas mice exposed to single CT scans exhibited transient genotoxicity, enhanced apoptosis, and characteristics of radiation sensitization. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION In the last decade, the number of computed tomography (CT) scans performed has increased nearly sevenfold worldwide (1-3). In the United States alone, it is estimated that more than 65 million CT scans are performed annually 1 Address for correspondence: Department of Medical Physics and Applied Radiation Sciences, Nuclear Research Building Room 227, 1280 Main St. West, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, L8S 4K1; e-mail: phann@mcmaster.ca. (2, 4 , 5). Studies in North America and Europe indicate that these procedures represent only 5-10% of all radiological examinations but account for 30-67% of total radiation exposure in patient populations (3, 6, 7). The estimated average dose range for a single CT examination is between 10-30 mGy, but it can be as high as 80 mGy depending on the procedure and size of the individual (5, 8-10). These higher radiation doses have prompted ongoing discussions regarding the potential health risks that CT scans may pose (2, 7, 11-17). According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), it is important to minimize radiation dose to "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) (18-21); however, CT scans may be critical for immediate medical intervention. Therefore, under certain conditions, the benefit of the diagnostic procedure outweighs any small estimated risk from the radiation exposure. We studied the biological effects of low-dose diagnostic X rays from CT scans. In particular, the effects of single and repeated 20 mGy CT scans were investigated in a C57BL/6 mouse model with respect to three well-established biological end points: micronucleated reticulocyte (MN- RET) formation, histone H2AX phosphorylation, and apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activation). Micronuclei form in dividing cells that contain unstable chromosome aberrations such as acentric chromosome fragments. Micronuclei are useful biological indicators of radiation exposure, and their formation has been used as a means of analyzing in vivo chromosomal damage (22-25). The in vivo erythrocyte-based micronucleus assay employed in this study has shown a robust dose-response correlation to clastogenic chemicals as well as to ionizing radiation exposure at doses up to 1 Gy and dose rates up to 2 Gy/min (23, 26-28). The broad utility and sensitivity of the MN-RET assay can provide a better understanding of the biological impact of low- dose radiation on hematopoietic stem cell progeny. In addition to micronucleus analysis, histone H2AX phosphorylation was examined as a surrogate biomarker for radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (29, 164</page><page sequence="2">BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SINGLE AND REPEATED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS 165 TABLE 1 Experimental Groups for the Investigation of the Biological Effects of CT Scans Treatment Specifications Experiment 1 : CT scan dose response for the induction of MN-RETs" Sham for Single CT Scan n = 5*, 25 weeks old Single 20 mGy CT Scan n = 4**, 25 weeks old Single 40 mGy CT Scan n = 3, 25 weeks old Single 60 mGy CT Scan n = 3, 25 weeks old Single 80 mGy CT Scan n - 3, 25 weeks old Experiment 2: CT scan-induced adaptive response: MN-RETs" Sham for Single CT Scan n - 5*, 25 weeks old Single 20 mGy CT Scan n = 4**, 25 weeks old 1 Gy y rays n = 4, 25 weeks old Single 20 mGy CT Scan + 4 h + 1 Gy y rays n = 3, 25 weeks old Single 20 mGy CT Scan + 6 h + 1 Gy y rays n - 3, 25 weeks old Single 20 mGy CT Scan + 12 h + 1 Gy y rays n - 3, 25 weeks old Experiment 3: Biological effects of single and repeated CT scans* Sham CT Scan' n - 9, 25 weeks olď Single 20 mGy CT Scan n - 8, 25 weeks old Repeat Sham CT Scans"7 twice/week/10 weeks (Tues, Thürs) n - 24, starting at 16 weeks old Repeat 20 mGy CT Scans'7 twice/week/10 weeks (Tues, Thürs) n - 24, starting at 16 weeks old " Experiments were performed on the same day. * and ** denote the same mouse groups. h Biological end points assessed were MN-RET formation, cellular y-H2AX fluorescence, and apoptosis. r Some of the mice from the sham groups were also included in the sham groups for a study performed concurrently by De Lisio et al. (50). d Two independent repeat experiments; data were pooled. 30). Histone protein H2AX phosphorylation rapidly forms y-H2AX at nascent DNA DSB sites (31, 32). Thus the y- H2AX assay can be used to measure DNA damage and repair after radiation exposure from CT scans. DNA DSBs can initiate genomic instability and can potentially lead to cancer after high-dose exposures (33). Assessing levels of H2AX phosphorylation can provide insight into the genotoxic effects and possible genomic instability induced by low-dose diagnostic CT scans (34, 35). Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of cell death that has distinctive morphological and biochemical features (36). Organisms activate the apoptotic pathway to eliminate extraneous or genetically damaged cells (3 7, 38). It is well documented that ionizing radiation can damage DNA and induce apoptosis (39, 40). However, it is not clear if or how the radiation quality and doses of diagnostic CT scans influence the homeostatic balance of cell death. Cell death via apoptosis can be triggered by activation of proteolytic enzymes called caspases. In caspase-dependent pathways of apoptosis, the activation of "executioner" caspases 3 and 7 is an essential step in the apoptotic process (41, 42). In this study, apoptosis, measured by activation of caspases 3 and 7, was investigated to highlight the cytotoxicity of X rays originating from diagnostic CT imaging procedures. Having employed the three aforementioned biological end points, this study investigated the adaptive response with respect to low-dose diagnostic CT scans. Low "priming" doses of ionizing radiation (&lt;100 mGy) have been shown to alter the biological response of subsequent challenge radiation doses (1-2 Gy) in eukaryotic cells of many different species, including mice (43), rabbits (44) and humans (45^f8). An adaptive response is present when the observed negative biological response is decreased by the priming dose after exposure to the challenge dose. The adaptive response is highly variable across cell types, tissues, systems and organisms (39, 49). This investigation examined the existence, magnitude and kinetics of an adaptive response induced by single and repeated in vivo CT scans. Results from this research will further the understanding of the biological effects of low-dose medical diagnostic CT scans. This research is timely and relevant to medical practitioners, policymakers and regulators who must make informed decisions about the use of ionizing radiation. Its significance cannot be understated in light of the increas- ingly complex modalities that are being developed to image and manage disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Male C57BL/6 mice (14 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were allowed to acclimate for 2 weeks prior to random assignment to the various treatment groups (Table 1). Up to five mice were housed in solid-bottom polycarbonate cages (27 X 12 X 15.5 cm) containing woodchip bedding (Harlan Sani-Chips, 7090). A stainless steel wire-bar hopper held food (Harlan Lab Diets, Indianapolis, IN) and a water bottle for consumption ad libitum. The housing room was maintained at a 12:1 2-h light:dark photoperiod with an inside air temperature of 22 ± 2°C and 40-60%</page><page sequence="3">166 PHAN ET AL. humidity. All protocols were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board at McMaster University and were carried out according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Some of the mice from the sham groups were also included in the sham groups for a study performed concurrently by De Lisio et al. (50). Computed Tomography Protocols Whole-body CT scans were performed on a Gamma Medica X- SPECT Animal Imaging System (Northridge, CA). Mice were placed in pairs into a customized sectioned polycarbonate tube and CT scanned (75 kVp, 215 |iA, 1-mm aluminum filter, half-value layer 4.28 mm aluminum, 250 projections) for 60 s to give a dose of 20 mGy. The mice were not anaesthetized during the CT scans because immobilization for image analysis was not necessary. Mice were treated as follows: (a) a single CT scan of either 20, 40, 60 or 80 mGy at 25 weeks old; (b) repeated 20-mGy CT scans twice a week (Tuesday and Thursday) for 10 consecutive weeks (starting at 16 weeks old); (c) a sham single CT scan (i.e. control, age-matched); (d) sham repeated CT scans (i.e. control, age-matched) (Table 1). Computed Tomography Dosimetry Whole-body dose measurements were obtained using thermolumi- nescence dosimeter (TLD) chips (Harshaw TLD-100 LiF Chips). TLD chip analyses were performed by a third party specializing in clinical diagnostic radiation measurements (K&amp;S Associates Inc., Nashville, TN). To measure the whole-body absorbed dose in mice, TLD chips were surgically implanted in five locations in a mouse carcass: head, chest, abdomen, above the skin, and under the skin. Measurements were performed on six individual carcasses on two separate occasions (before and during the study). The overall uncertainty of the TLD measurement process is 5% at the 95% confidence interval for a single TLD chip at the measurement location. This uncertainty does not take into account minor variations in the placement of the TLD chips between different mouse carcasses. Consistent dosimetry was confirmed and validated repeatedly throughout the study using a 0.6-cc ionizing chamber (Farmer Dose-meter Model 2570A and PTW Freiburg Model TN30010 Ion Chamber). The calculated mean whole- body dose for a 60-s CT scan at the aforementioned specifications was 19.5 ± 3.6 mGy. A group of mice were given repeated CT scans twice a week starting at 16 weeks of age to simulate the annual diagnostic CT procedures that may be prescribed to monitor injury or disease status in adult human patients. To control for the possible effects of age when assessing the biological differences between single and repeated CT scans, mice were age-matched up until the time of tissue harvest (i.e. 25 weeks old). For the investigation of the effects of repeated CT scans, tissues were harvested 5 days after the last CT scan time. This harvesting schedule permitted the assessment of the cumulative effects of the repeated CT exposures instead of the immediate acute effects of the last CT scan. Acute Radiation Challenge Doses The effects of in vivo and in vitro irradiations were investigated. Irradiations performed in vivo allow for the investigation of the systems-based biological responses, whereas in vitro irradiations help with understanding cell-specific responses without the influence of systemic factors from the whole animal. In vivo radiation challenge. Cohorts of mice (Fig. 1) were given a whole-body y-radiation challenge dose of 1 Gy (662 keV ,37Cs) at a dose rate of 0.28 Gy per minute. Respective control mice were sham- irradiated (i.e., placed in the polycarbonate tubes for an equal amount of time but with no exposure to radiation). All in vivo radiation challenges were performed with the same customized polycarbonate tubes used for the CT scans. In vitro radiation challenge. Bone marrow harvested from euthanized mice (Fig. 1) was separated into three aliquots (1 X 106 cells/ml) for an in vitro y-radiation challenge of either 0, 1 or 2 Gy at a dose rate of 0.17 Gy per minute (662 keV 137Cs). All samples were kept on ice-water slurry (0°C) during the in vitro radiation challenges. Sample Collection and Cell Preparation Blood. Mice were anesthetized using Isofluorane ™ and blood was collected at 43 h after in vivo radiation challenge via cardiac puncture according to previously published protocols (26). Approximately 50 |il of blood was collected in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (VWR International, Mississauga, Ontario) containing 350 'i' heparin solution (VWR International). The heparinized blood was maintained at room temperature before being fixed (within 4 h). After blood collection, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Bone marrow. Bone marrow samples were collected by flushing both femurs with a 23-gauge needle containing 1 ml of heparinized RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ). The disaggregated bone marrow cell suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml micro- centrifuge tube (VWR International) and then held at 0°C in ice-water slurry until processing (within 1 h). Bone marrow cells were counted using the Z2 Coulter Particle Count &amp; Size Analyzer (Beckman- Coulter, Miami, FL). The cell sample was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 X 106 cells/ml in ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA Laboratories Inc., Etobicoke, Ontario), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ), and 1% L-glutamine (Lonza Inc.). Three 1.5-ml replicate aliquots of the cell sample suspension were made for in vitro irradiations at 0, 1 and 2 Gy. Micronucleated Reticulocyte Assay The reagents used for preparing blood specimens for flow cytometry analysis were from a commercially available kit, Mouse MicroFlowPLUS® (Litron Laboratories, Rochester, NY) and included a heparin-based anticoagulant solution, buffer solution, anti-CD71- FITC, anti-CD6 1 -PE, RNase and propidium iodide. Cells were fixed and stored in absolute methanol (CAS no. 67-56-1, Sigma Aldrich, Mississauga, Ontario) at -80°C for a minimum of 24 h before flow cytometry analysis. Methanol-fixed blood samples were washed and labeled for flow cytometry analysis according to procedures detailed in the Mouse MicoFlowPLUS Kit manual (vP4.3m) and described previously (57). Briefly, fixed blood cells were washed with 12 ml of kit-supplied buffer solution and the pellets were maintained on ice- water slurry (0°C) until staining within 4 h. An 80-jj.I reagent mixture containing anti-CD71-FITC, anti-CD61-PE, RNase and buffer solu- tion was added to a 20-|il aliquot of each fixed blood sample in duplicate. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by 30 min at room temperature and then returned to ice. Immediately before acquisition on the flow cytometer, 1 ml of cold (4°C) propidium iodide (1.25 jig/ml in buffer solution) was added to each tube. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Anti-CD71- FITC, anti-CD61-PE and propidium iodide fluorescence signals were detected in the FL1 (525 ± 15 nm), FL2 (575 ± 15 nm), and FL3 channels (620 ± 15 nm), respectively. The gating logic used to quantitatively analyze the erythrocyte subpopulations has been described previously (57). Analysis windows were set to quantify the number of reticulocytes (RETs) and MN-RETs for each sample. To ensure adequate sample sizes for statistical significance, the number of RETs was measured in a total of 2 X 105 erythrocytes. The number of MN-RETs was evaluated based on counting a total of 2 X 104 total RETs per sample. y -H2AX Fluorescence Assay The protocol for determination of y-H2AX foci by flow cytometry has been described previously in detail (50, 52). Briefly, 500-^1 aliquots were removed from irradiated cell samples and incubated for</page><page sequence="4">BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SINGLE AND REPEATED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS 167 FIG. 1.

All sample tubes were maintained on ice-water slurry for 1 h and stored at - 20°C until analysis. For analysis, the fixed bone marrow cells were washed in 3 ml of Tris-buffered saline (IX TBS; Trizma base + NaCl, Sigma Aldrich, Mississauga, ON), resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-saline-triton [(TST; TBS + 4% FBS (VWR International, Mississauga, ON) + 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, Mississauga, ON)] and incubated on ice for 10 min to permeabilize cells. The cells were then resuspended in 200 jlxI of anti-phospho-H2A.X (seri 39) antibody (y-H2AX; Upstate Cell Signaling, Charlottesville, VA). Samples were incubated with the primary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. The cells were then washed with 3 ml of TST, resuspended in 200 |il of Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab')2 antibody (Invitrogen Canada, Burlington, Ontario), and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.

Samples were put on ice and promptly analyzed on the Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Analysis was based on 5 X 103 cells from the lymphocyte-rich cell population, as determined by flow cytometry scattering patterns. The level of y-H2AX fluorescence was measured by examining the mean fluorescence intensity of cells stained with the Alexa Fluor® 488- conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab')2 antibody (Invitrogen Canada). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Apoptosis Assay Measurements of apoptotic cell death were performed using the Carboxyfluoresein Fluorochrome Inhibitors of Caspases (FLIC A) 3, 7 Apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC, Bloomington, MN). FLICA specific for caspases 3 and 7 [FAM-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val- Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone] binds covalently to activated caspase sites, thus allowing the fluorochrome to accumulate in caspase-driven apoptotic cells. Briefly, 10 |il of 30X FLICA solution was added to 300-|il aliquots of irradiated mouse bone marrow cell suspension at a concentration of 1 X 106 cells/ml. The stained cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C in 95% air/5% C02. Cells were washed twice with 2 ml of IX wash buffer (supplied) and maintained on ice until analyzed (within 1 h) on the Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Cells identified as dying by apoptosis were defined as FLICA +. The percentage of cells dying by apoptosis was determined from analysis of 5 X 104 cells. Statistics Statistics were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16.0 (Chicago, IL). Data are presented as means ± SEM, with P &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. Dose- response significance testing was performed with linear regression or Spearman rank order correlation where appropriate. Student's t tests were carried out to determine if significant differences existed between groups for micronucleated reticulocyte data. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to determine significance between groups for y-H2AX fluorescence levels and apoptosis data. RESULTS Biological Effects of Single CT Scans 1. Induction of micronucleated reticulocyte formation after CT scans The induction of MN-RET formation in mouse peripheral blood was assessed after whole-body CT scans of varying doses (20, 40, 60 and 80 mGy). Only three mice per group were needed to achieve statistically significant dose separation because of the high reproducibility and consis- tency of the MN-RET assay. Inter-day MN-RET levels in unirradiated age-matched control mice were highly stable, and minimal variability was observed between mice (data not shown). There was a statistically significant linear dose response for the induction of MN-RETs after exposure to CT scans (P &lt; 0.033, R2 = 0.9838) (Fig. 2). Significant increases in MN-RET frequencies were detectable for CT scan doses as low as 20 mGy relative to sham CT-scanned mice (P = 0.02). 2.

The kinetics of the adaptive response was determined through varying the delay between the priming (CT) and challenge (y-ray) doses (Fig. 3). A single CT scan increased the MN-RET frequency by 28% above unirradiated sham levels (P = 0.02), while the unprimed 1-Gy challenge irradiation increased the MN-RET frequency by approxi- mately sevenfold. An adaptive response was observed only with a 6-h delay between the priming CT scan and challenge dose (P = 0.039), where the MN-RET frequency decreased 19% compared to the unprimed 1-Gy challenge dose. 3.

This elevated apoptosis level in CT-scanned mice persisted after in vitro challenge doses of 1 and 2 Gy (P &lt; 0.009). There was a statistically significant correlation between apoptosis levels and in vitro challenge doses for both sham CT-scanned mice and CT-scanned mice (P &lt; 0.05); however, the magnitude of the apoptotic processes appeared to reach a plateau after 1 Gy. Biological Effects of Repeated 20-mGy CT scans 1. Induction of MN-RET formation after repeated 20- mGy CT scans The mean percentages of peripheral blood MN-RETs after 10 weeks of repeated CT scans are shown in Fig. 6. The MN-RET levels in mice that received repeated CT scans (0.36 ± 0.02%) were slightly reduced compared to the sham CT-scanned mice (0.41 ± 0.01%) (P = 0.04). After a 1-Gy in vivo challenge dose, there was no significant difference in MN-RET frequencies between repeated CT- scanned mice and sham CT-scanned mice (P = 0.337). For both sham and repeated CT-scanned mouse groups, the 1- Gy in vivo challenge dose produced a sevenfold increase in MN-RET frequencies relative to the unchallenged mice (P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 6). 2.

However, after in vitro challenges of 1 and 2 Gy, mice that received repeated CT scans had approximately 10% lower y-H2AX fluorescence levels than those of sham CT-scanned mice ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.026, respectively). There was a significant dose-dependent increase in mean cellular y- H2AX fluorescence after the in vitro challenge doses for both sham CT-scanned mice and repeated CT-scanned mice (P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 7). 3. Apoptosis after repeated 20 -mGy CT scans Apoptosis levels in bone marrow cell populations of mice given repeated CT scans for 10 weeks were approximately 5% lower compared to sham CT-scanned mice at baseline and after a 2-Gy challenge dose (P &lt; 0.01 and P = 0.034, respectively). There was no significant difference in apoptosis levels between the two groups of mice after an in vitro 1-Gy challenge dose (P = 0.20). Apoptosis levels increased proportionally to the level of in vitro challenge doses for the sham CT-scanned mice (P &lt; 0.05). However, the same correlation was not observed for the repeated CT- scanned mice beyond a dose of 1 Gy, as assessed by Spearman's rank order correlation (P &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 8). DISCUSSION Considering that CT scans contribute up to 67% (3, 6) of the dose to the patient population and 14% of the total annual dose to the general population (5J), there are good reasons to better understand the biological effects of these diagnostic procedures. The research presented here demon- strated that low doses from single and multiple CT scans FIG. 8.

Biological Effects of a Single CT Scan Studies assessing cytogenetic effects of X radiation from single CT scans have shown enhanced chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes (54-58). Cytogenetic events such as increased acentric and dicentric chromo- somes, chromosomal fragmentation, chromosomal translo- cations, and y-H2AX focus formation have been associated with CT radiation (53-60). The present study supplements these findings by examining the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of single 20-mGy CT scans. Micronucleus formation has been shown to be a reliable measure of unstable chromosomal aberrations resulting from ionizing radiation exposures (26, 61-65). In most studies, chromosomal aberrations are observed directly in the treated cells. In this study, a flow cytometry-based MN- RET assay was used to measure damage manifested in hematopoietic precursor cells. This provided insight into the processing of upstream damage (26, 66). In this study, a significant linear correlation between MN-RET formation in peripheral blood and CT scan doses as low as 20 mGy was observed (Fig. 2). Previous studies investigating both microscopy-based and flow cytometry-based MN-RET formation after acute X-ray and y-radiation exposures have reported linear dose responses up to 1 Gy (26, 65). However, this is the first report in which a dose less than 50 mGy has been measured using the flow cytometry-based MN-RET assay. The increase in MN-RET formation after a single acute exposure to a 20-mGy CT scan indicates that ЗЭ ■ ■ Repeat Sham CTs 30 * ■ Repeat 20 mGy CTs 25 ■ Ит ■■■ - 15 ' io • 0 ^ 1 ^ 1 0 1 Challenge Dose ÍGy) 2.0 ■ 1.8 . ■ Repeat Sham CTs S ■ Repeat 20 mGy CTs fl 16 ' 0) Й 1.4 ■ 2 ^ * _ 0.0 ^ 1 ^ 1 0 1 Challenge Dose (Gy)</page><page sequence="8">BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SINGLE AND REPEATED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS 171 low-dose CT scans can induce change to the division of the hematopoietic system responsible for reticulocyte produc- tion and erythropoiesis. A number of studies have investigated the effects of CT scan-induced chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Stephan et al. showed that CT scans (12.9 mGy) in children can significantly elevate the frequencies of dicentrics and excess acentric fragments (57). Similarly, Jost et al. reported significant increase in dicentric chromosomes in human lymphocytes exposed in vitro to a 20-mGy CT scan (54, 56). Assuming that some of these damaged cells escape apoptosis and proceed with cell division, the consequence may be an elevated population of micronucleated cells. In this study, the observed increase in MN-RET frequencies after an in vivo single 20-mGy CT scan supports previous documented effects. Hottayoglu et al. demonstrated that measurements of dicentrics and micronuclei in hematopoietic cells are comparable assess- ments of radiation-induced genotoxicity (64). When a single 20-mGy CT scan was given 6 h before a 1- Gy challenge dose, the MN-RET levels in the CT-scanned mice were significantly decreased relative to sham CT- scanned mice challenged with 1 Gy. This response has been described as an adaptive response. However, when mice were CT-scanned at 4 h or 12 h prior to a 1-Gy challenge dose, there was no apparent adaptive response with this MN-RET end point. The adaptive response observed when a CT scan was given 6 h prior to a 1-Gy challenge dose may be due to enhanced CT-induced cell killing of prospective micronucleated cells. The increased apoptosis levels detected in bone marrow cells 6 h after a single 20-mGy CT scan support this hypothesis (Fig. 5). Another explanation for this time-specific adaptive response induc- tion may be cell cycle delay caused by the priming single CT scan. Priming doses as low as 20 mGy have been shown to cause transient cell cycle delay and alter the distribution of cells within the cell cycle (67-70). Sorensen et al. found that adaptive responses were highly dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of challenge irradiation (46). Using fluorescence microscopy analysis of y-H2AX focus formation as a quantitative biomarker for radiation-induced DNA damage in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Rothkamm et al. reported an 8-10-fold increase after a whole-body in vivo CT scan dose of 16.4 mGy (53). Grudzenski et al. demonstrated increased y-H2AX focus formation in both in vivo and in vitro CT scans (&lt;20 mGy) (58). Golfier et al. reported increases of y-H2AX focus formation in human lymphocytes after in vitro CT irradiation with doses as low as 25 mGy (54). Similarly, Lobrich et al. reported significant increases of y-H2AX focus formation in both lymphocytes and fibroblasts after an in vivo CT scan (~20 mGy) (71). In this study, mean cellular y-H2AX fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry instead of the standard microscopy-based y-H2AX focus formation assay. Pilot projects and previous studies demonstrated that the flow cytometry-based y-H2AX assay was effective in detecting adaptive responses (50, 52). Although there is a strong correlation between the microscopy-based and flow cytom- etry-based y-H2AX assays (72-76), their detection limits for ionizing radiation exposure may differ. Microscopy- based y-H2AX analysis can detect doses less than 5 mGy (77), whereas the minimum reported dose detection limit for flow cytometry-based y-H2AX analysis is approximately 100 mGy (73, 74, 78, 79). In this study, the reason for the lack of a difference in cellular y-H2AX fluorescence levels of sham CT-scanned mice and mice that received a single 20-mGy CT scan (P - 0.678) may be either the kinetics of y-H2AX focus induction/disappearance at the sampling time or the detection limit of the flow cytometry-based y- H2AX assay. Phosphorylation of histone protein H2AX is an early response to DNA DSBs. As DNA damage gets repaired, the level of y-H2AX foci decreases. Since maximal y-H2AX focus induction occurs around 30 min after radiation exposure, this study's 6-h waiting period after CT scans may have allowed the initial effects of the CT scan to disappear (31, 73). The 6-h time was chosen because this interval between the priming CT scan and the challenge dose allowed the induction of an adaptive response, albeit with MN-RET formation. After a 1-Gy in vitro challenge dose, there was no adaptive response observed with respect to mean cellular y- H2AX fluorescence levels in mice that received a single CT scan 6 h earlier. However, CT-scanned mice showed elevated y-H2AX fluorescence levels after a larger 2-Gy challenge dose relative to the sham CT-scanned mice (P = 0.037). It is possible that the single 20-mGy CT treatment sensitized the bone marrow cell populations, but only the 2- Gy challenge dose was large enough to show this sensitization effect in this end point. The biological mechanism(s) of this possible sensitization effect is still unknown but may involve cell cycle delay. Cramers et al. examined y-H2AX focus formation in human lymphocytes and suggested that low priming doses can induce perturba- tions in the cell cycle that may affect adaptive responses (SO). We propose that the 20-mGy CT scan given 6 h before the 2-Gy challenge dose caused perturbations in cell cycle kinetics that made lymphocyte-rich bone marrow cells more sensitive to damage from the high-dose challenge, as measured by y-H2AX fluorescence levels. Apoptosis was investigated in the heterogeneous bone marrow cell populations. A single 20-mGy CT scan increased spontaneous levels of apoptosis and enhanced the cytotoxicity of both the 1- and 2-Gy challenge doses. This heightened sensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis resembles the sensitization effect observed in CT-scanned mice with the y-H2AX end point after a 2-Gy in vitro challenge dose. These parallel sensitization observations could be related. In support of this hypothesis, Lu et al. demonstrated that UV-radiation-induced y-H2AX is re- quired for apoptotic DNA ladder formation (81). Also, the formation of y-H2AX was found to be an important step in</page><page sequence="9">172 PHAN ET AL. initiating apoptosis via the caspase 3/caspase-activated DNase pathway (81). Apoptosis is a protective mechanism by which unstable or damaged cells remove themselves from the population (39). Ionizing radiation causes oxidative stress (82), and higher levels of reactive oxygen species have been correlated with increased programmed cell death responses (&amp;?). The enhanced apoptosis levels observed in this study after a single acute 20-mGy CT scan supported the postulation that radiation from CT scans may trigger apoptosis in a portion of unstable cells, thus potentially changing the overall risk to those cells. Portess et al. support this by demonstrating that low-LET radiation (2 mGy) can trigger selective removal of precancerous (src pretransformed) cells (84). Also, Belloni et al. found that there was a direct relationship between dicentric chromosomes and the triggering of apoptosis of human peripheral blood lymphocytes after X- ray exposure (85). Apoptosis levels in mouse bone marrow after an in vivo 20-mGy CT scan without an in vitro challenge dose were higher than levels in sham CT-scanned mice after a 1-Gy in vitro challenge dose (Fig. 5). This observation may be a result of differing kinetics associated with in vivo and in vitro irradiations and the timing of when analyses of apoptosis were performed. There was a 12-h period between the time of the in vivo single CT scan and the time of apoptosis measurement (i.e., 6 h between CT scan and in vitro radiation challenge dose plus 6 h of bone marrow incubation time with caspase markers). In the sham CT- scanned mouse group, the radiation-induced apoptosis resulting from the 1-Gy in vitro challenge dose only had 6 h (bone marrow incubation) to manifest. Thus the higher apoptosis levels in the former case may be due to the time at which apoptosis was measured with respect to the two radiation exposures (in vivo CT scan and in vitro radiation challenge). Further experiments are required to support this postulate. Relatedly, the relatively high spontaneous apoptosis level seen in the sham CT group (24.6%) is likely due to the cellular stress caused by the extraction and 6 h in vitro incubation of the bone marrow samples and not a real reflection of the in vivo homeostatic apoptosis level. The significance of this study's apoptosis results is not the absolute apoptosis levels but the demonstration of relative differences in the apoptotic responses after the in vivo single CT scans and in vitro radiation challenge doses. Biological Effects of Repeated CT Scans Using a flow cytometry-based micronucleated reticulo- cyte (MN-RET) assay, this study demonstrated that 10 weeks of repeated 20-mGy CT irradiations (total accumu- lated dose of 400 mGy) produced a slight reduction in spontaneous MN-RET levels compared to non-CT-scanned mice (P = 0.04). Further experiments are required to confirm this finding, because this reduction in MN-RET levels was observed only after the data pooling of the second of two independent repeat experiments. Nonethe- less, repeated CT scans did not increase spontaneous MN- RET levels. Reticulocytes are the progeny of erythroblasts, which are hematopoietic bone marrow stem cells. A lack of increase in MN-RET levels may indicate that the erythroblast stem cells did not become genomically unstable after the repeated CT irradiations. Using the same flow cytometry-based assay and mouse strain as this study, Hamasaki et al. found that 1 year after an acute in vivo 2.5-Gy X-ray dose, spontaneous MN-RET levels in irradiated mice remained significantly higher than in the unirradiated controls. Hamasaki et al. proposed that the higher MN-RET level is evidence of radiation-induced genomic instability caused by the high- dose exposure (66). The lack of elevated spontaneous MN- RET levels after repeated CT scans, when compared to Hamasaki et al. (66), is likely a consequence of the lower total dose (400 mGy compared to 2.5 Gy) and the fractionation of that dose. Moreover, if the observed reduction in spontaneous MN-RET frequencies in the repeated CT-scanned mice is real, this may indicate that the population of erythroblasts in these mice may be more stable and that their clonal expansion and differentiation processes may be improved. However, a similar reduction was not evident in mice treated with repeated CT scans after an in vivo 1-Gy challenge (P = 0.337). The latter result could be because the 1-Gy challenge was too damaging to the erythroblast population, thus prohibiting the observation of an adaptive response for this particular end point, which saturates around 1 Gy (26). Another reason for the lack of an adaptive response may be simply due to the specific kinetics of the adaptive response (86, 87). It is generally accepted that almost every DNA DSB forms a y-H2AX focus. Contention arises, however, when determining whether every y-H2AX focus represents a DNA DSB (33, 77, 88). Rothkamm et al. demonstrated quantitatively that detection of y-H2AX foci has a strong correlation with DNA DSBs (77). Assuming that cellular y- H2AX fluorescence levels correlate well with DNA damage, the fact that there were no statistically significant differences in spontaneous y-H2AX fluorescence levels between mice treated with repeated CT scans and sham CT- scanned mice may indicate that repeated CT scans did not cause persistent DNA damage. However, the lack of difference may be partly due to the dose detection limit of the flow cytometry-based y-H2AX assay (73, 74, 78, 79). Despite the relatively high dose detection limit for the flow cytometry-based y-H2AX assay, an adaptive response was observed in bone marrow cells of repeated CT-scanned mice after in vitro challenge doses of 1 and 2 Gy (Fig. 7). The recurring mild oxidative stress resulting from the repeated CT X-ray treatments may have triggered an adaptive response similar to that reported in a recent study published by Ermakov et al ., where oxidative stress was found to be critical for the induction of an adaptive response in human lymphocytes (82).</page><page sequence="10">BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SINGLE AND REPEATED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS 173 Comparable to the reduction seen with MN-RET formation and y-H2AX fluorescence levels, repeated CT scans significantly lowered spontaneous and radiation- challenged apoptosis levels (P &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 8). The biological mechanism for the observed decreased apoptosis levels is unknown. However, the frequent mild oxidative stress produced by repeated CT scans may have caused an initial elimination of unstable cells, as supported by the increased apoptosis results from single CT scans (Fig. 5). This increased removal of potentially unstable cells, triggered by the initial CT scan(s), would result in cell populations with fewer chromosomal aberrations and reduced DNA damage. Results for the MN-RET (Fig. 6) and y-H2AX (Fig. 7) end points in mice given repeated CT scans support this postulation. Through a selection process over time, there may be a shift to a homeostatic state wherein the observed lower apoptosis levels reflect a more robust cell population. The Biological Relationships between Single and Repeated CT scans Low-dose ionizing radiation from CT scans causes oxidative stress via production of damaging reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species can cause damage to DNA by modification of bases, inter-carbon ruptures in deoxyri- bose, the appearance of apurinic and apyrimidinic sites, single- and double-stranded breaks, DNA-protein cross- links, etc. (39). Damaged cells can attempt to repair or undergo apoptosis if the damage is substantial. A single CT scan will increase DNA damage, as demonstrated by increased MN-RET formation (Fig. 2), y-H2AX foci and chromosomal aberrations (53, 54, 56, 57, 60). CT radiation- induced oxidative stress will initially cause an increase in apoptosis levels as damaged and/or radiosensitive cells die (supported by the single-CT apoptosis results; Fig. 5). Ermakov et al. suggested that as cells undergo apoptosis, DNA fragments are released into the intercellular space and interact with DNA-binding receptors such as toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) of neighboring cells. This interaction activates cellular signaling pathways associated with synthesis of more reactive oxygen species, thus inducing a crucial oxidative stress cascade required in the adaptive response. Repeated CT irradiations would likely continue to increase oxidative stress levels and trigger more unstable/ radiosensitive cells to undergo apoptosis. Eventually, most of the unstable or damaged cells are eliminated, and the remaining cells are more robust and may have fewer chromosomal aberrations. The latter was demonstrated in this study by the reduction in spontaneous MN-RETs and the induction of an adaptive response with respect to cellular y-H2AX fluorescence levels in mice treated with repeated CT scans. With potentially fewer unstable chromosomal aberrations that would likely trigger apopto- sis, the overall effect is lowered apoptosis levels (Fig. 8). Results from repeated CT scans support the notion that frequent mild levels of oxidative stress allow for the maintenance of a healthy cell population by fostering the death of unstable and damaged cells. Summary The biological effects of single and repeated CT scans are opposite to but are not necessarily unrelated to each other. Many recent studies have examined only the biological effects after acute single CT scans. This study complements previous work examining the biological responses from single CT-scan exposures by providing further insight into the biological effects of multiple CT scans. In summary, repeated 20-mGy CT scans do not appear to induce genomic instability in reticulocytes and confer resistance to larger doses in the bone marrow of mice. Conversely, exposures to single CT scans exhibit transient genotoxicity, enhanced apoptosis and characteristics of radiation sensiti- zation.
