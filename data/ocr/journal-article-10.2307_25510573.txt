Vanoest. By Fernand Benoit. Paris, 1945. (45 PL, 1 Map.) These three works, published when Europe was cut off from the normal interchange of erudite literature, should claim the attention of students of the wider aspects of Celtic studies, and of those who would wish to learn something more of the European background of the insular Celts. M-L. Sjoestedt, whose untimely death was-a great loss to Celtic studies, published in this book a valuable appreciation of the outlines of Celtic paganism, and the whole subject is refreshingly approached from the standpoint of social anthropology no less than from expert knowledge of the native, and relevant classical, literatures. Due recognition is made of the pre-eminence of the Irish literary evidence on Celtic paganism not only for Ireland but as a mirror in which, to some degree, can be understood, and vitalised, the material relics of the Continental Celts whose literary tra ditions, unlike the Irish, did not survive. The nature of the Celtic attitude to superhuman and sacred powers (the inaccurate word religion is not used) is set forth as clearly as the evidence allows. Of particular interest is the treatment of parallels in rite, or the identity of divinities, across the various divisions of the Celtic world, and in certain cases across the whole socio-linguistic field of Indo-Europe. The existence of a great oral tradition of sacred and social custom preserved by a body of learned men, of whom the druids formed at least a part, is emphasized as one of the most important factors contributing to the unity of the Celts in matters other than material culture, in which there is very little. In dealing with the deities, the distinction is made between the gods who are generally concerned with human activities, and the god desses who appertain essentially to Nature. The male deities are usually to be identified with a people or tribe, the female with localities and seasons. It would be almost possible to say that at root the Celts had no functional distinction between their gods on the one hand and the goddesses on the other. The god name changed with the people, or dynasty, who claimed a divine ancestor. The goddesses, under localised names, but reflected the central theme of Earth fertility. The concept of gods and men sharing the Earth alike is well in evidence in the Irish traditions, and the frequent interchanges between those two groups of beings illustrate a fundamental attitude in the primitive Celt to the</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 149 magical or superhuman potentialities of his daily surroundings. The word supernatural would be inaccurate in describing any aspect of experience, for to the Celt everything waa a natural manifestation. The last two chapters are devoted to a discussion of the main inferences to be drawn from the Irish heroic literature; in the first instance from the Ulster Cycle " and its chief hero, Cuchulain who epitomises the warrior and aristocratic qualities of an overlord society. The more complex problem of the significance of the Finn cycle is contained in the second analysis, and a most attractive solution to the nature of the Fianna "... les heros hors de la tribu . . ." is offered. This hypothesis must certainly be a great deal nearer the truth than previous explanations, and the present writer only hesitates to accept it in view of the evidence of the traditional genealogies, and the geographical distribution of the Fianna stories, both lines which appear to associate the Fianna with a different culture and people than the Ulster charioteers, although both groups may be originally of the same period. This book certainly merits the wider study which an English trans lation would give it. Contributions a VEtude des Divinites Celtiques is concerned with a late phase in Celtic paganism when the divinities had become envisaged, and represented, in human form. The author has studied the Continental and Romano-British material, but no mention is made of the Irish evidence either in stone or tradition, and the statement on page 15 " Nous ne posse dons aucun texte celtique " is difficult to understand. Research has been mainly directed to the identity of Celtic divinities by name, function and attributes, and Dr. Lambrechts has enriched his publication by including eight maps showing the distribution of the principal deity types in France and western Germany. A chapter is devoted to each deity with a well recognised symbol, such as the god with three faces, wheel, serpent, hammer, and others. A large number of the representations in Gaul date from the period of Roman occupation, and display dedicatory inscriptions, usually in Latin, sometimes in Gaulish, equating Celtic and Roman god names. These inscriptions, alongside the truly archaeological considerations of style and motif, do much to illustrate the fundamental lack of distinction between the Celtic gods. The assimilation of the intro duced cults of Mercury, Mars and Hercules in Roman Gaul are considered, and the book concludes with a valuable synthesis on the Celtic pantheon from the Gaulish evidence, with some notes on female divinities, and some parallel characteristics in Teutonic mythology. The chief lesson to be learnt immediately from the distribution maps is the regional preference for gods of particular attributes, and these may be supposed to correspond to tribal differences. The god with the mallet or hammer has a preponderance of representation in the Rhone and Saone valleys, and the three-faced god holds sway further north, in particular between the Oise and Marne. There is, however, considerable overlap in the distributions. These maps will become of increasing interest for insular</page><page sequence="3">150 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND studies when the archaeology of the Celtic settlement of Ireland has made further progress. M. Fernand Benoit has set a high standard in the excellence of his illustrations, and this is one of the very few adequately illustrated books to appear on any aspect of the prehistoric archaeology of France. The quality of the paper and text print is also much superior to that usually experienced. From the seventh century B.C., the mixed population of the Provencal coastlands, and the lower Rhone valley, were in touch with the trader settlers of Magna Graecia whose main centre was Massilia, and relations were also developing by the overland route with Northern Italy, in particular with Etruria. To these Mediterranean influences must be ascribed the origin of Celtic anthropomorphic art of the pre-Roman period, and it was in the Rhone valley that its highest development was reached sometime in the second century B.C. The sculptured figures from Roquepertuse have long been famous, and a further important collection of heads, and portions of statues, has come to light at the site of the Salyian sanctuary at Entre mont, which was destroyed in 123 B.C. at the time of submission to Roman rule. The portrayal of gods in human form was an essentially Mediterran ean, and ultimately Ancient Eastern practice; the Celts had not ventured further than zoomorphic symbolism, and this is borne out in many of the deity names and aspects retained in the Irish literature. The final step resulted in an impressive, if horrific, art of which only the faintest outer waves touched the insular Celts. The stones from Kilnaboy, Boa, and Corleck are descended from such pieces as the opposed heads from Roque pertuse which are so magnificently illustrated in this work. T.G.E.P.</page></plain_text>
