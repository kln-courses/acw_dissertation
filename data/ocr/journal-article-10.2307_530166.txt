Recent fieldwork at the site of Pampa de las Llamas- Moxeke in the coastal Casma Valley of Peru has revealed important details of an early complex society which dates to about 1400 B.c. Extensive archae- ological excavations have yielded data on a variety of activities vital to the urban center. Public structures such as truly monumental mounds as well as subsidiary administrative buildings have been explored along with both elite and lower status domestic units. Available information on subsistence and burial practices is also discussed, and the site is compared to other contem- porary coastal settlements. Introduction The Casma Valley is formed by one of the more than 50 rivers that flow from east to west, carrying water toward the Peruvian Pacific coast. Since these rivers rely on precipitation in the higher Andes, few are permanent streams and all have periods of peak flow between about January and April. Because of the extreme dryness of the Peruvian coastal desert, each valley is like an oasis. Since the river provides the only source of water, canal irrigation came into use very early because it was essen- tial to the extensive agriculture necessary to support large settlements. The juxtaposed Pacific Ocean is a rich source of marine resources that also has a long history of prehistoric exploitation. Initial Period Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke has been dated securely within the Initial Period (1800 to 900 B.C.) by a series of eight radiocarbon dates that range from 1785 + 75 B.C. to 1120 + 85 B.C. and average about 1400 B.C.' The Initial Period has traditionally been viewed as an un- spectacular outgrowth of the earlier Cotton Preceramic Period (2500 to 1800 B.C.), whereas the rise of civili- zation is attributed to the succeeding Early Horizon (900-200 B.C.) and especially to the Chavin phenome- non.2 Recent reexamination of the evidence, however, has revealed that the Initial Period was extremely dy- namic and saw the development of complex coastal pol- ities.3 At least one of these, centered at Pampa de las 1.

Each site is domi- nated by one or more large corporate labor mounds which are usually U-shaped and often adorned with friezes.5 In addition to the advent of irrigation agricul- ture, other technological innovations characterize the Ini- tial Period. True weaving appeared at this time, but this technique did not immediately replace cloth production by twining, the method used during the Cotton Prece- ramic Period. Ceramics first appeared during the Initial Period, and the dominant vessel shape was the neckless olla, a form probably modeled after preceramic gourd containers. There is increasing evidence that stone bowls or mortars were also important.6 All of these general features of the Initial Period characterize the site of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Previous Fieldwork The first archaeological fieldwork at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke occurred almost 50 years ago, in 1937. At this time, the renowned Peruvian archaeologist Julio C. Tello made the first known plan of the site with the aid of Donald Collier, then his student.7 He also exca- vated within the mound of Moxeke where he uncovered the well known anthropomorphic friezes.8 In 1956, Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke was tested as part of a general valley survey by Donald Collier and Donald Thompson.9 This testing consisted of only two small pits within and near Huaca A, north of Moxeke.10 Although Tello originally recognized and recorded Pampa de las 4.

This fieldwork focused primarily on obtaining chronological information and subsistence data. To accomplish this, over 40 test pits were exca- vated in midden areas at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, and detailed stratigraphic excavations were expanded from six of them. The different types of architecture visible on the surface were sampled by clearing small areas in order to assess the labor necessary for potential substantial architectural excavations in the future. In 1985, the authors began a more ambitious campaign to investigate early state formation within the Casma Valley area. The first field season, which consisted of over 41 months of excavation with up to nine supervisors and a crew of 20 to more than 30 workmen, focused exclusively on the site of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. With such a large labor force, it was possible to clear large areas of the varied site architecture. This article reports on the results of both seasons of fieldwork. Site Layout The inland site of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke cov- ers an area of 220 ha within a large quebrada, or dry drainage, near the confluence of the Casma and Sechin Rivers (FIG. 1). It is unusually well preserved for its age of nearly 3500 years. This is due largely to the near absence of rain in the Peruvian coastal desert, resulting in climatic conditions that often allow for the preserva- tion of fragile perishables. Nevertheless, the site has not escaped untouched since it ceased to be occupied. Most damaging has been the encroachment of prehistoric and modem irrigation systems into the southern part of the site. Earlier systems appear to have been little used; therefore their effects are less pronounced. The intense human activities associated with current irrigation sys- tems, however, have erased all but the most substantial architectural features in the southern third of the site. The northern two-thirds is well outside the cultivation perimeter. It has been altered slightly, however, as a result of constructions by later prehistoric people. These late features include walls and roads as well as other structures. Finally, the site surface has been affected by erosion during infrequent El Nirio rains when more active channels of the quebrada become filled with water. The central axis of the site is formed by two large mounds which oppose each other across a series of pla- zas (FIG. 2). Moxeke, which dominates the southern part of the site, opens toward the north, facing Huaca A, the largest structure in the north end of the site. Huaca A, uniquely, has entrances both on the south toward Mox- eke and to the north. Well-formed square, sunken plazas occur at either end of Huaca A. These probably provided much of the fill for the mound core. Further north is a smaller sunken plaza, circular in shape, which is a com- mon feature of Initial Period sites. A series of parallel rows of intermediate-sized mounds and enclosures flank Moxeke and Huaca A on either side of the central site axis (FIG. 2). This central axis and most of the accompanying rows of structures have a magnetic orientation of 41' east of north. One segment of intermediate structures along the western side of the site has a magnetic orientation of 400 east of north. It was during mapping of the longer rows of intermediate structures that the extreme precision of previously-rec- ognized orderly site layout became apparent. The fronts of these structures vary only 2 to 6 cm from a straight line across a distance of over 700 m. Once recognized, this prehistoric precision facilitated current site mapping because the theodolite could be sighted along the front faces and measurements taken along this line as well as taped in from this line. Not all the architecture at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke shares this alignment. In the NE part of the site there are large areas of agglutinated structures which are irregular in both form and orienta- tion. Huaca A and Moxeke Huaca A and Moxeke are the two dominant mounds at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Both are clearly cor- porate labor constructions, and their large size suggests that they were the locus of centralized authority at the site. Close examination of the mounds reveals that each had a distinct function. Moxeke appears to have been the seat of ideological power or religion whereas Huaca A served in a more secular manner that involved the 11. Tello, loc. cit. (in note 7). 12. Collier, op. cit.

Moxeke The mound of Moxeke has been widely known and appreciated for almost 50 years because of the work of Julio C. Tello.13 The polychrome friezes he uncovered in 1937 received immediate attention and have continued to be the main reference point for subsequent discussions of the site. In addition to exposing the friezes, however, Tello's extensive excavations on the summit of Moxeke made great progress toward elucidating the general plan of the mound, which was also published in 1956.14 This early fieldwork revealed the mound to be quite high, with a bilaterally symmetrical U-shaped summit config- uration. Moxeke measures 170 m x 160 m and stands 30 m high. Moxeke was briefly tested by the authors in 1985. More extensive excavations were not carried out there, however, nor do they seem feasible because 1) tons of backdirt from Tello's 1937 excavations overlie the cen- tral north entrance and atrium; 2) intrusive late prehis- toric burials and subsequent looting have drastically altered the surface of most of the mound to a depth of at least 1.3 m; and 3) modem cultivation has destroyed most associated structures, leaving Moxeke relatively lacking in context. Nevertheless the data are adequate to begin to discuss Moxeke and its function within Pampa de las Llamas- Moxeke. Moxeke closely resembles many other U- shaped mounds in Peruvian coastal valleys. Excavated examples also have friezes that are mainly anthropo- morphic in content, suggesting that deities are repre- sented."5 This is certainly true of Moxeke, where full figures as well as colossal heads 2.4 m wide are depicted. 13. Tello, loc. cit. (in note 7). 14. Ibid. 57. 15. T.

First, the size of the figures in- dicates that they were designed to be visible from quite a distance. The full figures would probably have been over 3 m tall. Second, the placement of the friezes high on the mound front and extending around on either side serves to enhance their visibility to an audience any- where in the vicinity of the mound front. Finally, the plaza remnants immediately north of Moxeke indicate that these were the largest such public areas at the site, providing ample space for a large group to view the mound. These characteristics, taken together, imply that Mox- eke was the locus of ideological power within Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. The public nature of the friezes and architecture suggests that rituals or ceremonies in full view of the site population were a critical aspect of religious motivation. The role of Moxeke is further elu- cidated, however, by contrasting data concerning the secular activities at Huaca A. Huaca A Huaca A is the more northerly large mound at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. It measures 140 m x 140 m and stands 9 m high. The absolute height differences between the two mounds are probably less significant than it appears because the quebrada surface rises gradually from south to north, toward Huaca A. Despite their comparable summit elevations, the two mounds are very different. Huaca A has entrances on either end, resulting in a lower central area accompanied by an increase in height along the peripheries (FIG. 3). Even without excavation, it is evident that the mound surface is formed by numerous very regularly laid-out rooms that generally decrease in size toward the Nw and SE peripheries. So regular is the layout that the mound is bilaterally symmetrical both NE-SW and NW-SE. Thus, all four quarters of the mound have a comparable pattern of rooms. Methodology Taking advantage of the four-way symmetry of Huaca A, excavations during 1985 focused on the north quad- rant because it is especially well preserved. Substantial areas of several rooms were cleared to their floors. The excavation methodology adopted for work on Huaca A represented a compromise between the desire to work within architectural units clearly distinguishable on the surface and the necessity to establish contextual units of a manageable size. Especially problematical was the fact 2 4 0 25 50 N AREAS EXCAVATED Figure 3. Plan of Huaca A showing location of excavations con- ducted in 1985. Note the bilateral symmetry of layout, both along the NE-SW axis and the NW-SE axis. that, though room centers versus standing walls are clearly distinguishable as low versus high areas on the huaca summit, the precise location of buried wall faces could not be determined prior to excavation. The methodology adopted involved imposing grids of two m sq on the areas to be excavated. This grid both followed the precise alignment of the mound architecture and attempted to accommodate wall locations of major rooms. Using plumb bobs to insure accuracy on the uneven mound surface, the grid was produced by using large nails tagged with plastic. Lines could easily be stretched between them as necessary to guide excava- tions. Given the depth of the wall collapse, or "fall," which often exceeds 2 m, it was constantly necessary to remove and relocate individual nails as excavations deepened. This was easily accomplished, however, using the nearby grid nails for reference. Within each square, upper wall fall strata were removed with picks and shov- els, whereas material within 10 cm of the floor was troweled down and passed through a 4-inch screen. Ul- timately, large areas of room floors were exposed, and the superimposed grid system was invaluable in record- ing floor features, mapping the individual rooms, and creating a general huaca plan. Profiles recording wall</page><page sequence="6">386 Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke/Pozorski and Pozorski fall were made along each exposed room wall. These were crucial for estimating original wall height and elu- cidating details of upper wall construction. Architectural Details Almost immediately after excavation began, it was evident that architectural features on the summit of Hu- aca A are exceptionally well preserved through burial under tons of wall fall. Most room walls are still standing well over 1.5 m high, and some exceed 3 m in height. Calculations based on wall fall profiles reveal that orig- inal wall heights were probably between 4 and 7 m. These walls consist of immense boulders, most of which were quarried from the nearby granitic hillside and are quite angular. Additional, more rounded, boulders col- lected from the quebrada surface are also distinguishable because of their dark patina. Some construction stones appear roughly shaped, especially examples used for entrance comers; most are unshaped, however, but set with their flattest surface forming the wall face. All walls are double-faced, and most are between 1.85 and 2.35 m thick. Component stones are held in place by tan, silty mortar, and material of the same composition was employed in a 3 to 5 cm-thick layer of inner plaster that served to create an even surface on the rough stone wall face. This inner plaster frequently exhibits abundant fin- ger marks and was clearly never intended to be seen. One or more coats, 1 to 1.5 cm thick, of finer silty clay plaster were applied to create smooth wall surfaces, and this finishing plaster was coated with white paint. The finishing plaster of the NE central room (Room 4) is unusual because it contains vegetable-fiber temper. Floors were also prepared by the application of a layer, 1 to 3 cm thick, of fine plaster that was painted white as well. Rooms comprising the summit of Huaca A are char- acterized by one or more rounded corners-an architec- tural trait common to early sites in this area.16 In simpler cases, such as Rooms 3 and 7, this unusual architectural canon was easily accommodated within the thick wall construction. In the larger central rooms such as Room 4, however, the result is a series of concave interior comrners associated with convex exterior corners that af- fects the architecture of the adjoining rooms (Room 10 and the atrium). Adjustments to the use of rounded comrners also frequently resulted in doubly thick walls. For example, excavation revealed that the "wall" be- tween Room 4 and Rooms 2 and 3 consists of two fully formed and plastered parallel walls. The intervening 12 to 50 cm space was immediately filled with rubble and especially plaster. This peculiarity of construction does not appear to reflect remodeling or distinct construction phases. Instead, it reveals the manner of dealing archi- tecturally with the intersection of two exterior convex rounded comers. Remains of niches are present near the wall tops in all excavated rooms where walls are sufficiently pre- served, except Room 2, which is clearly an access cor- ridor. These niches vary in size from 85 cm x 39 cm to 175 cm x 69 cm. Exceptionally well preserved examples have heights of up to 139 cm, clearly exceeding their 130 cm width. This suggests that the niches in general were once quite tall, and this is consistent with the reconstructed wall heights. All of the niches are well above the floor. Niche heights above the floor decrease as one moves from the huaca center to the periphery. Niches in Room 4 are 200 cm above the floor whereas niches in Room 7 are only 121 cm above it. Niche size and height above the floor are consistent within each room, and the band of niches that encircles most rooms is consistently set off by a ledge five to 15 cm wide. Both the niche interiors and the ledge are finished with the same fine plaster and white paint used on the walls. In the rooms with niches, especially in the vicinity of the niches, and near the entrances between rooms, both wood fragments and conical adobes are especially com- mon in the wall fall. Neither of these construction ma- terials was actually observed in its original position, but since both occur consistently in the lowest wall fall strata, it is believed that they were used in the uppermost wall zones. More specifically, the wood probably con- stitutes the remains of lintels that spanned the niches and entrances, whereas the adobes were used to complete the wall above the wooden elements because they are lighter than stone. Room 1 is the single exception to this pattern, for it contained virtually no wood or conical adobes. Instead, extremely long stones occurred in the vicinity of each of four niches recorded (FIG. 4). Two additional long stones were found near the south comer of the room where niches also probably once existed. All the stones are long enough to span the niches and serve as lintels. Extensive clearing and careful sweeping of the room floors revealed that most of Huaca A was originally carpeted with reed matting. Large areas of impressions and occasional plant fibers were clearly visible in the finely plastered room floors. Two types of matting are clearly distinguishable. One was fairly closely woven using junco (Cyperus sp.) reeds. Woven matting pre- dominates in Rooms 1, 4, 7, and 10. The second type 16. T.

Room 3 contained only remains of this coarser matting. Rooms 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 lacked evidence of matting, and these are most likely access corridors to more peripheral areas of the mound. Heavy traffic is especially evident in Room 2 because a depressed pathway has been worn in the plastered floor surface between the entrances. The niches and most of the rooms of the mound were likely used for storage-probably of commodities or textiles. Most of the evidence for this function is indi- rect, however. One niche did contain a large fragment of woven-cotton textile, and this could indicate either storage of textiles or storage within textile containers. Very little cultural material was recovered during exca- vation on the huaca. The extensive use of mats as a floor covering precludes the discovery of much floor-contact cultural material. Such "emptiness," however, is com- patible with the postulated storage function because it is expected that stored valuables would have been removed when the site ceased to be occupied. It is suggested that commodities, probably agricultural products, were stored within the huaca because hundreds of rodent bones were found in the niches and especially the rooms. It appears that these pests overran the abandoned huaca, flourished on the residues of foodstuffs, and eventually were trapped and died there. Rodent bones occur in decreasing frequencies as one moves into more inacces- sible rooms on the mound periphery. This may indicate that valuable noncomestible items such as textiles were stored in these more remote areas of the huaca. It is hoped that analysis of pollen samples from the rooms and niches will provide additional data on the nature of the material stored. Access restrictions within the huaca, however, provide ample evidence that the contents of Huaca A were being carefully guarded. The few artifacts recovered do provide some clues about the people using Huaca A. Most of the turquoise beads, a whole jet mirror, a complete wooden figurine, and some of the most finely-made textiles were recov- ered during the excavations there. These luxury or pres- tige items indicate that members of the site elite played an integral part in mound activities. Access Patterns Within Huaca A, there is abundant evidence that movement into and within the rooms was closely mon- itored and controlled. Numerous features of the mound architecture were clearly designed to impress or awe the visitor, to restrict or impede his access, and to channel his movements. The most elaborate access area excavated so far is the main entrance to the NE end of the mound. Ascending the central staircase to the mound summit, one enters the NE atrium and is immediately confronted by an enor- mous friezed wall adorned by a pair of felines (FIG. 5), one of the more spectacular discoveries of the 1985 season. Each half of the bilaterally-symmetrical low- relief mud sculpture occupies a 10 m span of wall on either side of the main mound entrance, which is 2.2 m wide. A low bench, 120 cm wide and 25 cm high, further accentuates the frieze and may have served as a barrier to discourage too close an approach. Although the dec- orated wall segment is only partially preserved, it is clear that the main component is a pair of full-figure profile felines that face each other across the entrance.

The two felines, probably jaguars, once faced each other across the main NE entrance to Huaca A. In front of the body of each feline are the remains of a standing human figure dressed in a tuniclike garment and possibly a robe. Beside the front foot of each feline is a circu- lar abstract design possibly representing a symbol of authority. Each feline has a serpent-head tail. The reconstruction drawing is based on 1) extant feline depictions in other media of early Andean art and 2) estimated original wall heights from excavated wall debris profiles. on preserved feet and tail segments as well as on com- parisons with other renderings of the profile feline which is common in early Andean iconography.17 Based on the body proportions of complete examples, it is estimated that the felines adorning Huaca A were originally 10 m long and 5.5 to 6 m tall. This assessment is in accord with wall height estimates based on wall fall. Ample evidence of white paint covers much of the frieze, along with faint traces of red and possibly blue pigment. Thus it is likely that the frieze was at one time polychromed. Associated with each feline is a circular design located immediately in front of the forelegs on either side of the entrance. The innermost part, an oval with four rectan- gles, forms an element in the stone carvings of Cerro Sechin where it occurs on the "nonhead" ends of war- riors' clubs.18 The more curvilinear elements forming the border may represent a stylized tooth band. Between the feet of each feline are remnants of an additional depiction. Based on the more complete west- ern example, it appears that a human figure is repre- sented, mainly by the legs. Portions of a possible short tuniclike garment are present. The raylike objects on either side of both figures may depict a capelike article of clothing, suggesting that the figure is standing in front of the body of the feline. It is also possible that the raylike objects represent the borders of a cloth, adorned by the human figure, which was draped across the body of each feline. Clearly, the frieze adorning Huaca A was once an imposing sight. Its three-dimensional aspect would have been enhanced by the curvature of the atrium's SE wall (which is the exterior convex wall of Room 4) which has four round comers. The location and size of each segment document clear efforts to awe the mound visitor, but with more secular power symbols. In contrast to the Moxeke friezes, where anthropomorphic depictions are dominant, the possible human figure on the Huaca frieze is dwarfed by a feline and associated with what appears to be an even more secular authority symbol. 17.

An opposing pair of pilasters located near the mid- dle of the entrance serve to constrict the opening. Both raised thresholds and pilasters occur in all of the en- trances excavated on Huaca A. Typical pilasters consist of a bundle of small (0.5 to 2 cm) straight branches wrapped and tied with junco cord to form a composite "post" 10 to 15 cm in diameter that forms the core of the pilaster. Once the wooden core was set deeply (50 cm or more) into the entrance floor, it was attached to the entrance wall by substantial amounts of coarse inner plaster that also served to give the pilaster a generally square to rectangular shape. Finally, the entire pilaster was finished with the same fine plaster used elsewhere and painted white. Remains of a gate made of wooden posts document prehistoric efforts to control entrance into the mound (FIGS. 6, 7). This gate was located on the interior side of the main entrance. It consisted of four posts which mea- sure 3.47 to 3.51 m in length and 7 to 13 cm in diameter that were tied with junco cord and set upright into the wall west of the entrance opening. A series of six longer cross-posts that served to bar the opening were held in place by the four excavated uprights as well as a probable second set that was only partially exposed east of the entrance. The cross-posts were larger, measuring 4.06 to 4.21 m in length and 10 to 18 cm in diameter. They were placed across the entrance with their small and large ends alternating in order to create a level barrier which was over 1.5 m high. Access through all of the remaining entrances exca- vated on Huaca A was restricted by one or more bar- closure mechanisms. Reconstruction of the nature and function of this device is based on an intact example- complete with a wooden bar---discovered during simul- taneous excavation within an aligned enclosure (FIG. 8). It consists of a pair of small opposing niches in the entrance walls about 1 m above the floor. The visible portion is formed of four stones, but consistently one niche is quite shallow (55 cm deep or less) whereas its opposite niche is very deep, extending 140 cm or more into the wall. This niche is actually a long, narrow chamber created to hold a small wooden bar or post. This bar was drawn across the opening and set into the shallow niche to create a barrier or retracted into the chamber to allow passage through the entrance. All of the entrances excavated contain a single pair of niches except the passageway between Rooms 2 and 4, which transects the doubly thick wall described above. Two pairs of niches occur there: one in the Nw end where the threshold is level and a second pair above a set of stairs in the SE end. The bar closure over the stairs clearly served to restrict access from Room 4 into Room 2. To persons moving in this direction, up the stairs, the bar would have been a definite barrier whereas persons coming from the opposite direction, down the stairs, could easily have stepped over the extended bar.

The four logs on the left once stood vertically on the left side of the entrance whereas the six central logs were originally placed horizontally across the entrance. bar closure may also have had a locking mechanism. A niche in the NW wall of Room 4, north of the entrance, opens into a long chamber which intersects at a 900 angle with the deep niche within the north wall of the entrance. It appears that the bar closure was locked in position by a second wooden bar manipulated from within Room 4. In addition to the raised thresholds, pilasters, and bar closures of the interior mound entrances, there is addi- tional evidence of restricted access. First, rooms are not usually interconnected. For example, most of the large square rooms in the north quadrant are accessible only from Room 4 via Room 2. Similarly, the bank of small rooms which extends the full length of the Nw periphery of the mound can be reached only from the central room (Room 10) via Rooms 9 and 8 or via Rooms 9, 6, and 5. Second, as one moves into more inaccessible areas, one moves higher in elevation, a more subtle reinforce- ment of access restriction. The stairway between Rooms 2 and 4 spans an elevation change of 1.4 m; Rooms 1, 2, and 3 are at approximately the same elevation. Mov- ing out of the central room (Room 10), there is an elevation change of about 1.5 m in order to enter Rooms 9 and 8, which are at the same level. Room 7, however, and presumably the other peripheral rooms, is some 2 m above Rooms 9 and 8. Rooms 5 and 6 are even higher, at an approximate elevation of 2.7 m above Rooms 9 and 8 and a total of 4.2 m above the floor of the central room (Room 10). Data on access control, taken together with the rodent and textile remains indicating a storage function for the rooms and niches, argue strongly that Huaca A served as a repository for surplus goods and that the collection and distribution of these goods was closely monitored. Additionally, its distinct architectural configuration com- bined with an absence of ritual paraphernalia and friezes within the interior plazas and rooms indicate that Huaca A served as a secular counterpart to Moxeke. It was apparently the focal point for bureaucratic activities which functioned to control access to products of the site's agricultural and industrial economy.</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 13, 1986 391 Previous Construction Phases Limited probing beneath the floors of certain rooms revealed evidence of an earlier construction phase. Hints of its presence were provided by a continuous crack that is evident in the cleared floor areas of Rooms 1, 2, and 3. A comparable floor crack also appeared during sub- sequent excavations in Room 9. Soundings through the floor were made in each of these first three rooms, but their areal extent was small in order to avoid damage to the well-preserved final construction phase. The more NW 1 X 1 m cut in Room I and the 1 x 1 m cut in Room 3 encountered only fill of the type which is visible in occasional looters' pits elsewhere on the mound. It consists of a virtually sterile loose matrix of coarse sand, gravel, cobbles, and very occasional boulders. It has a gray to blue cast, indicating that its source was a rela- tively active wash zone of the quebrada. In fact, it closely resembles sediments which compose the floor and walls of the sunken rectangular plazas NE and sw of Huaca A and was probably derived from there, resulting in the lowered plaza floors. Excavations 1 m x 1.5 m below the floors of Rooms 1 and 2 encountered additional near-sterile fill overlying and filling architecture pertaining to an earlier construc- tion phase. Cuts within this architecture showed that it was constructed on a core of the same fill. The exposed segment of earlier construction appears to have been a NE-SW wall aligned with the current mound orientation. At a depth of about 1 m below the floor of Room 2, a probable raised threshold was encountered, indicating the presence of an earlier entrance aligned with the Room 2/Room 4 passageway. In Room 1 the subfloor pit ex- posed a wall face which began almost immediately be- low the later room floor and extended downward over 0 25 50c. czz Figure 7. Reconstruction of the gate on the inside of the NE entrance to Huaca A. Two sets of four logs were set vertically into the walls on either side of the entrance. Six central logs were set one at a time hori- zontally into the slots formed by the two sets of vertical logs. 150 cm, where excavation ended before any associated floor was reached. This wall face contains a niche of the type associated with bar closures, and the 124-cm length of the recessed chamber reveals that it was the side designed to receive the bar. These data suggest several things about the penulti- mate construction phase of Huaca A. First, the wall segment appears truncated, but not eroded, thereby in- dicating that the mound was in use when it was leveled slightly, filled, and remodeled. Second, although the mound surface configuration apparently changed consid- erably, the basic orientation was still followed, and prin- cipal access routes seem to have been generally maintained. The evidence for a bar closure mechanism documents the importance of access control during the earlier use of the mound. Third, the addition of 1.5 m or more of fill plus the construction of the rooms which give the mound its final configuration involved an ap- proximate doubling of the huaca volume during a single construction phase. This represents a substantial corpo- rate labor effort marshalled according to a preconceived plan. Aligned Enclosures and Mounds The subgroup of aligned structures at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke consists of both enclosures and mounds. The enclosures occur only in the vicinity of Huaca A, where they are present both Nw and SE of the mound. The aligned smaller mounds rarely occur as isolated structures but, instead, form rows of two or more mounds which may approach 1 km in length. These rows are clearly visible on the site map, revealing definite efforts at site planning. During the 1985 field season, excavations were carried out in one enclosure and one aligned mound. Much of one wall and a corner of the enclosure were cleared, and fully half of the aligned mound was excavated to the floor. The methodology followed essentially the same procedures used on Huaca A. Aligned Enclosures Of the total of seven enclosures that surround Huaca A, only four are complete. One of the latter examples south of the huaca was selected for excavation. Data from this work revealed that enclosures are square to rectangular in form and consist of four high walls which meet in rounded corners. A low bench, 5.5 m wide, against these walls encircles the interior of the enclosure, and opposing entrances are present in the NW and SE walls. Enclosures were constructed primarily of angular granite quarried from the hillside, but subangular boul- ders from the quebrada surface were frequently em-</page><page sequence="12">392 Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke/Pozorski and Pozorski Figure 8. View from the NW of a wooden bar closure mechanism found in an intermediate enclosure just south of Huaca A. To allow access into the enclo- sure, the wooden bar was retracted into a long, narrow, stone-lined chamber on the left side of the entrance. To deny access, the bar was pulled out from the long chamber and its end was inserted into a shallow niche on the right side of the en- trance. ployed as well. Component stones are held in place by a coarse, tan mortar composed of silt and sand, and wall faces and floors are finished with 1 to 4 cm of finer plaster. The intact bar closure mechanism was discovered dur- ing excavation of the SE entrance. Initially a 10-cm segment of the wooden bar was noted protruding from the wall niche. It proved to be firmly embedded, so an excavation was made into the wall top to observe the portion remaining within the wall. As clearing pro- ceeded, the 2.05 m long chamber became visible, com- plete with stone lintels, support stones, and a stone floor. By clearing away debris that had collapsed into the chamber, it was possible to draw the bar out of the chamber and rest it in the opposing shallow niche, thereby recreating its function (FIG. 8). Although there is slight evidence of prehistoric reuse of the enclosure at a much later time, virtually no arti- facts associated with the primary occupation were re- covered. Some of those that were are prestige items such as turquoise, indicating use of the compounds by the site elite. In this respect, and because of the evidence for restricted access, the enclosures resemble Huaca A. The enclosures also appear to have had a public or bureau- cratic function. Perhaps they acted as a "buffer zone" around Huaca A, serving as holding areas for persons and/or goods moving to and from the storage areas on the main mound. It is noteworthy that so many of the enclosures are unfinished. This suggests that enclosures, and their proposed traffic-regulating function, were a relatively late development in the history of the site. Aligned Mounds Over 70 aligned mounds are still preserved at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, and numerous additional exam- ples were probably present before modem cultivation encroached on the southern third of the site. These mounds range in size from 10 to 50 m on a side and are 2 to 5 m high. Most share a consistent U- or H-shaped, bilaterally symmetrical summit configuration. Clearing of half of an example north of Huaca A revealed additional construction details (FIG. 9). Entrance to the structure was afforded by way of stairs and an atrium very reminiscent of Huaca A architecture, espe- cially because of the convex rounded comers evident on either side of the atrium. Stairways lead up from the atrium into the side or wing rooms whereas a raised threshold characterizes the entrance between the atrium and the central room, which is lower than the lateral or rear rooms. Remains of pilasters are present in the SE entrance to the central room as well as the NW entrance, which also has a raised threshold. The walls are not preserved enough in height to determine whether bar closures were present. Like the main mound and enclosures, most of the smaller aligned mounds are constructed mainly of an- gular granitic boulders quarried from the hillside. This is especially true of examples on the western side of the site near the source of quarried stone. The structure excavated contains quarried wall stones in excess of I m in diameter, but this is unusual, occurring only very near the rock source. In contrast, aligned mounds in the eastern portion of the site contain a much higher pro-</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 13, 1986 393 Figure 9. View from the south of a par- tially cleared U-shaped mound located NW of Huaca A. The central court area, central staircases, raised threshold, and round corners are all architectural traits shared with Huaca A. It is believed that this mound as well as other similar mounds at the site were used for adminis- trative purposes. portion of weathered subangular stones from the que- brada surface. Boulders were set in coarse mortar to create walls 3.5 to 4 m high that were finished with a coat of finer plaster. Floors were similarly plastered. Initially, the aligned mounds at Pampa de las Llamas- Moxeke were grouped into several types on the basis of surface features. It soon became apparent, however, that many examples were unfinished and that variations re- flected different phases in the construction process rather than distinct types. This made possible a reconstruction of their construction sequence. Creation of an aligned mound began with the outlining of its square-to-slightly- rectangular form using boulders. Fill was subsequently scraped up from the quebrada surface and/or brought in and built up to the desired height. Mounds often fronted on sunken plazas and drainages in order to take advan- tage of the resultant impression of greater height that these depressions afforded. The basic form of the mound was created by distributing the fill to allow for a lower atrium and central room, with higher surrounding lateral and rear areas that resulted in a U-shaped configuration. These integral features of the mound were defined by stone facings and retaining walls. Finally, additional, more superficial walls were constructed on the surface of the summit to further subdivide the lateral and rear areas. Careful survey of incomplete aligned mounds also documented an ongoing process of urban renewal that was proceeding according to a preconceived plan. There is clear evidence of the leveling and displacement of domestic structures to create space for the expansion of rows of mounds. This occurred on both sides of the main site axis. Although the mounds on the west side appear finished, there are several instances of later remodeling. In at least one case, a mound was expanded in size by incorporating material from an adjacent mound. The aligned mound excavated yielded very few arti- facts and no evidence of domestic activity associated with its primary occupation. Once again, the presence of prestige artifacts such as jet mirror fragments suggests that members of the site elite presided over the mound activities. Thus, like Huaca A and the enclosures, the aligned mounds appear to have had a more public func- tion. Because of architectural similarities to Huaca A, it deems most likely that the smaller mounds functioned with respect to the administrative bureaucracy at the site. Perhaps their occupants served as intermediaries in- volved in the flow of personnel and/or goods between Huaca A and the general site population or even to other smaller contemporary sites. The incomplete nature of both enclosures and aligned mounds Pampa de las Lla- mas-Moxeke becomes more meaningful in light of their postulated function because evidence of "urban renewal" suggests bureaucratic expansion at the expense of other site components. Domestic Architecture Irregular structures concentrated in the eastern part of the site were identified very early as probable domestic units, and excavation data confirm this preliminary as- sessment. Results of excavation, however, also sug- gested that this was lower-class domestic architecture, prompting a search for residences of the site elite. These elite domestic structures were discovered behind, but</page><page sequence="14">394 Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke/Pozorski and Pozorski usually physically connected to, the aligned mounds on either side of the main site axis. Four areas of high- status domestic architecture were intensively tested, ac- companied by more extensive clearing in some rooms. Since units of lower-class architecture were generally smaller, large areas were cleared in four of these units. The methodology employed was adapted to the smaller size of the component rooms. Rather than im- posing a grid system of the type used on Huaca A, assignment of excavation contexts reflected the nature of the architectural configuration. For example, since rooms were generally small, their interiors were divided into four quadrants for excavation. Comparable pro- veniences were assigned for excavation units on room exteriors. Matrix within 10 cm of the floor was passed through a 4-inch screen, and especially significant arti- facts were given precise proveniences on the structure plan. Soil from features such as hearths or ceramic ves- sels was usually passed through even finer 2 mm and 710 micrometer mesh screens. Low-Status Domestic Architecture This architecture, which was most easily recognized as domestic, appeared, during initial surface examina- tion, very irregular largely because it does not align at all with the main site axis. What is more, many of the individual rooms as well as unit boundary walls are round to oval in shape, thus reinforcing the initial impression of irregularity. Closer examination reveals that specific rooms or room clusters recur repeatedly within the domestic units and that this architecture is somewhat organized and planned. The low-status domestic architecture is also distinctive because its rooms are generally small and the walls quite low, often no more than one or two cobbles high. Such low double-faced walls probably served as footings for perishable superstructures of wood or cane. Construction material is mainly subangular cobbles and small boulders from the quebrada surface; few very large boulders were used. As a result of the construction of domestic struc- tures and aligned mounds, the quebrada surface was cleared of usable stones for quite a distance beyond the limits of site architecture. Stones comprising the domes- tic structures were wet-laid with coarse mortar. Some walls are 50 cm or more in height and have remains of plaster on both interior and exterior wall surfaces as well as on the floors. The perishable superstructures were probably also coated with coarse plaster in the manner that quincha (wattle and daub) structures are finished today.

Plan of a unit of small irregular domestic structures lo- cated east of Huaca A. clustering of rooms or structures and/or the presence of a boundary wall. Among the domestic units there is considerable variation, much of which may reflect the length of time the unit was occupied. One particularly ephemeral unit was almost completely cleared. Only one short wall segment was clearly a double-faced construc- tion, whereas the remaining oval-to-round or sub-rectan- gular rooms were demarcated by low, unshaped piles of stones. The boundary wall was slightly better con- structed, with occasional segments of coursed stones. This contrasts with a much larger unit that contains several structures or clusters of structures with well- formed walls exceeding 50 cm in height (FIG. 10). There is evidence of long-term use of this complex because of refuse accumulation and because some rooms had gone out of use and been incorporated into the boundary wall. The artifacts and features discovered during excava- tion of these units clearly demonstrate their domestic function. Food residues are common both within and</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 13, 1986 395 outside rooms, and low mounds of stratified midden are associated with most of the more substantial units. Stone flakes and ceramics are common, and spindle whorls and textile fragments document in-house textile production. Charcoal is a major component of refuse in all contexts, and several hearths have been excavated. These are usu- ally in the centers of low-walled rooms and are small (40 to 60 cm) square to sub-rectangular features lined around the edges with stone and plastered on the interior. Most of the evidence for burning is concentrated in an oval or circular area near the center. Elite Domestic Architecture Areas of elite domestic architecture were not imme- diately apparent during initial surveys because of their close association with the aligned mounds. Not only are they physically connected to the mounds, they share the same precise orientation coincident with the central site axis. What distinguishes the elite domestic architecture, however, is its general lack of internal symmetry--a feature that contrasts with the consistent bilateral sym- metry of the aligned mounds. The construction materials and techniques observed in the elite domestic architecture link it to the public ar- chitecture at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke and further distinguish it from the low-status domestic architecture. Rooms are small to large, and open plaza areas are common. Extant walls are generally at least 50 cm high, and quarried hillside stone was commonly used in their construction. Quarried stone clearly predominates in structures along the western edge of the site, whereas toward the east subangular quebrada stone increases in frequency. Many walls were entirely of stone, originally standing 2 to 5 m high, but some of the lower examples (original height 1.5 m or less) probably had perishable superstructures. Wall stones were held in place by coarse mortar, and walls and floors were finished with finer plaster. One unit on the western edge of the site contains rooms with coats of red mineral paint on their interior walls. Four of the 10 rooms tested show evidence of this. There is ample evidence that these elite architectural units had domestic functions. Some artifacts and food residues occur within the rooms, but on the whole they were apparently kept cleaner than the low-status resi- dences. Substantial amounts of refuse are evident, how- ever, banked against the exterior walls of these structures and especially in areas immediately outside entrances. Hearths also provide evidence of domestic activity within these areas. One example excavated closely re- sembled lower-status hearths because of its location in the room center, its square shape, and its stone lining (FIG. 11). It was considerably larger (78 cm x 74 cm), however, as well as more finely plastered, and there was a specially prepared and plastered central depression to contain the fire. A second hearth discovered within the elite architecture may have had a specialized function as a kiln. This example is round, with an interior diameter of 60 cm. It is deeper than the square hearths, with a stone lining that extends to a depth of 38 cm. Around the hearth edge there is also a 15 cm-wide lip which was constructed of stones and finished with plaster. This hearth shows much more evidence of use; the interior Figure 11. View from the SE of an elite house structure showing a large central square hearth and a subfloor storage pit. The storage pit was probably covered at one time, with the lid flush with the room floor level. Entry into the storage pit was by way of a narrow pit extension off the north corner of the main chamber.</page><page sequence="16">396 Pampa de las Llamas-MoxekelPozorski and Pozorski plaster has been burned to a red color. The round hearth is closely confined within a small 2.55 x 2.45 m room with rounded comers and a low exterior bench 55 to 90 cm wide and 16 cm high. The entrance is unique because it has a lowered threshold, 10 cm deep, that extends 50 cm into the room as a depression. This depressed thresh- old, which may have promoted ventilation, as well as an unusual abundance of ceramics--especially in the area of the entrance--suggest that this specialized hearth may have furnished the heat to fire ceramics. A major feature of the elite architecture that distin- guishes it from the lower-status dwellings is evidence for storage within the structures. This evidence for the accumulation of goods on the household level takes a variety of forms. One elite housing unit east of Huaca A yielded evidence of pairs of small storerooms. Two such pairs were identified and excavated. Both had walls made entirely of stone that originally reached a height of at least 1.8 m. Component rooms are small, ranging in size from 1.95 x 1.6 m to 2.5 x 2.6 m. The floor of one room in each pair was thickly encrusted with sherds that were often several layers deep. These large and poorly-fired, thick ceramics were probably from large storage containers. Of special significance is the discovery of three large, but short, tripod feet that were part of one such vessel. This is the earliest documented occurrence of this vessel form on the Peruvian coast. Excavations in elite structures on the western edge of the site provided evidence of two additional types of storage facilities. One cleared room contained 11 niches. These measure an average of 92 x 46 cm and are 65 cm above the room floor. Measuring 6 x 5.9 m, the niched room is smaller than most examples on Huaca A, and its niches are more accessible. It also probably served a storage function, however. Two additional rooms within the same complex con- tain subfloor chambers that appear to be depositories. One example lies in the east comer of the room contain- ing the square hearth (FIG. 11). Its central chamber mea- sures 138 x 80 cm and is 86 cm deep, and there is a 62 x 40 cm extension off the west coner. The interior is well plastered but not coated with the fine clay-rich finishing material common to room walls that were de- signed to be visible. A 14 cm-wide ledge around the chamber edge also suggests that it had a fairly permanent cover and that access was normally gained via the ex- tension, which was less tightly covered. Impressions on mortar fragments within the chamber indicate that the cover was made of small shafts of wood covered with plaster. The chamber is in the east comrner of the room, quite near the entrance, so the cover was probably sturdy enough to bear the weight of human traffic. The location of the chamber so near the room front and entrance is governed by the distribution of local bedrock. A spur of hillside granite lies immediately beneath the remainder of the room. A similar subfloor chamber was discovered in a small room adjacent to the niched room described above. This depository is essentially rectangular, but with more rounded comers, and measures 135 x 95 cm x 70 cm deep. A peripheral ledge indicates that this chamber was also covered, and access was gained by a semicircular extension on the sw end that contains three well-formed steps. A large (10 cm) spot of red mineral pigment was noted on the floor of this chamber, but neither this ex- ample nor the other chamber and niches yielded any direct evidence of what they originally contained. Again, it is hoped that pollen analysis will provide additional data. In contrast to the situation within compounds and aligned mounds, artifacts were commonly associated with elite domestic structures. These include lithic de- bris, ceramics, and spindle whorls that also occur fre- quently in low-status dwellings. Other artifact categories, however, occur mainly in, or are restricted to, areas of elite architecture. Stone bowls or mortars occur more commonly near and within elite residences. These vessels are 15 to 22 cm in diameter and are estimated to have been 15 to 30 cm tall.19 They are generally cylindrical in form, but taper slightly toward the bottom. Most examples were fashioned from gabbro, andesite, or basalt, and they are rarely decorated. At least three examples, however, exhibit incised decora- tion, and the most complete design contains elements suggesting a face. Assessment of their function as mor- tars is based on the discovery of associated pestles and pestle fragments of the same materials. Remains of solid ceramic figurines are confined mainly to the elite architecture. Although no complete examples have been recovered, the range of headdress, head, arm, body, and leg fragments suggests they were probably about 10 to 12 cm tall. Most of the features are defined by short, straight incisions that adorn head- dresses and define fingers and toes and most facial fea- tures. Earholes consist of punctations, and eyes are formed by pressing on a tiny ball of clay and subse- quently piercing it with a small circular punctation. Arms and legs were generally modeled separately, although the legs are consistently touching in the finished exam- ples. The complete wooden figurine from Huaca A sim- ilarly has its legs together. Stamp and probable cylinder seals made of pottery are the final major artifact category associated exclusively with elite architecture. One example came from the 19. T. Pozorski and S.

All are incomplete, but the two stamp seals appear to have been used to impress a curvilinear "S" design. The grooves of both examples of this type are encrusted with red pigment that apparently was the medium applied by the stamp. They may have been used to mark textiles or even human skin. The cylinder seals exhibit designs that are more geometric. Cylinder seals have not been re- ported from the Andean area, and stamp seals are known only from Kotosh and Huacaloma,20 where they were used to decorate ceramics. It appears most likely that the seals from Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke served the site elite as a form of insignia employed in their duties connected with commodity distribution. Subsistence Excavations during the 1980 field season focused on the recovery of floral and faunal material to document the local diet at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. A distinct methodology was implemented to accomplish this. The resultant data reveal that the inhabitants had a varied diet and consumed a wide range of cultigens. Maize, however, had not appeared in the valley by this time. Methodology There was considerable surface evidence of buried midden at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, including the presence of an ashy matrix soft to the touch in addition to scattered shell, lithic debris, and ceramics. A series of 43 one-sq m test pits was excavated in these especially favorable areas in order to select locations for more controlled stratigraphic excavations by carefully remov- ing visible strata. Six such locations were chosen on the basis of the variety and state of preservation of the material recovered and on the condition of the deposit tested (i.e., whether it was truly stratified). At least one 1 x 1 m stratigraphic excavation was expanded from the test unit at each location. Working from the face exposed by the test excavation, it was possible to distinguish and excavate the visible strata of the matrix by following each stratum from the front of the cut to the back. Unusually thick strata were arbitrarily divided into units no more than 10 cm thick. The volume of each stratum and arbitrary level was measured by using buckets graduated in liters, and all material was screened through 4-inch mesh screen. The screen was tapped lightly and its contents spread gently by hand in order to avoid damaging fragile plant re- mains. Concurrently, a 25 cm-square column within the 1 m unit was excavated separately and the resultant matrix passed through 4-inch mesh screen and then bagged for finer screening through 2 mm and 710 mi- crometer mesh soil screens in the laboratory. While not affecting the total sample screened through the larger mesh, the additional finer screening allowed the recovery of very small plant parts, shells, and bones from a con- trolled volume of matrix. At least two soil samples were also collected from each stratum or artificial level. Preliminary Results of the Subsistence Study Many of the plant species are currently under study by specialists, and final assessment of the fish species is not yet complete. Enough information is available, how- ever, to discuss major features of the subsistence regime at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Despite the inland location of the site, most of the animal remains con- sumed were marine in origin. Shellfish are abundant and include the rock-perching small mussels Brachidontes purpuratus and Semimytilus algosus as well as chitons, limpets, and the large mussels Aulocomya ater and Cho- romytilus chorus. Clams from sandy beaches, especially Mesodesma donacium, occur in substantial quantities. Numerous valves of Eurhomalea rufa and Protothaca thaca were also recovered, but these oval clam shells 20. The stamp seal at Kotosh dates to the Early Horizon (900-200 B.C.) whereas the example from Huacaloma dates to about A.c. 600. S. Izumi and T.

Shells of Scutalus sp., the land snail, also occur fre- quently, indicating that this terrestrial mollusk was also a source of food. Fish remains are common, surviving both as dried heads and even portions of dried flesh. The first evidence of the use of land mammals as a food source comes from Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. A single fox-sized bone may be from an animal that was eaten. Bones of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virgini- anus), however, occur much more frequently, suggesting that these animals were an important protein source. Because of the dry climate of coastal Peru, preserva- tion of plant remains at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke is excellent. Cotton (Gossypium barbadense) remains, including seeds, fiber, bolls, and completed textiles oc- cur abundantly, as do gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) seeds and rinds and seeds from Iicuma (Lucuma bifera). Pea- nuts (Arachis hypogaea) first appear during the Initial Period, and shells and occasional nuts are common at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Avocado (Persea amer- icana), common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), lima beans (P. lunatus), squash (Cucurbita maxima), and especially tubers such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), sweet po- tatoes (Ipomoea batatas), and manioc (Manihot escu- lenta) were also important. Pepper (Capsicum sp.) and cansaboca (Bunchosia armeniaca) fruit occur more rarely. From these species inventories and relative frequen- cies, it is evident that the diet of the prehistoric inhab- itants was quite varied. Especially significant are the tubers because of the variety and quantity that occur. On the other hand, maize (Zea mays) is notably absent; it was not introduced into the Casma Valley until about 1000 B.C. Thus, the architectural achievements docu- mented above were accomplished on the basis of a sub- sistence system that stressed variety and included staples such as peanuts, beans, and tubers as well as fruits. Much of the space on Huaca A was probably devoted to the storage of these comestibles and their distribution. Burials Two burials were encountered during the 1985 exca- vations at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. One was lo- cated in an area of low-status domestic architecture, whereas the second occurred within one of the elite residences. In addition to these formal burials, isolated fragments of human bone occurred frequently in refuse deposits, especially in areas of low-status domestic ar- chitecture. Burial within Low-Status Domestic Architecture This burial was located near the south end of the largest irregular domestic structure excavated. It was placed in a pit that had been cut through the floor into sterile soil beneath an abandoned room. This room, which measures 2.6 x 2.45 m, had been incorporated into the outer south boundary-wall of the residential complex. The burial pit measured 93 cm E-w by 62 cm N-S, and it was excavated to a depth of over 75 cm below the uppermost room floor. The tomb was visible as a rock cluster within the room, and the matrix continued to be very rocky down to the level of the body, which was flexed and lying on its right side with its head to the NW and facing south. Both arms were flexed so that the backs of both hands were tucked under the chin. Both legs were parallel and tightly flexed. The individual was apparently female, and an adult age is suggested on the basis of complete fusion of the epiphyses of all the long bones. Possible evidence of traumatic injury is evident in the right parietal region near the back of the skull. At this locus, there is a 1.3 x 2 cm hole around which bone regrowth is evident. Grave goods associated with this burial were limited to a single large sherd which had been placed in front of the face, with its concave surface inward. In addition, the left zygomatic arch and the frontal bone are stained with red mineral pigment. This suggests facial paint or perhaps a colored head-covering. Burial within Elite Architecture The second burial encountered was within one of the subfloor storage chambers-the second example de- scribed above. The interment was made well after the depository ceased to be used for storage, since consid- erable fill had accumulated on the floor of the chamber before the intrusion of the burial. Over 10 cm of this fill separated the lowest part of the tomb from the floor of the chamber. The burial occupied an area 50 cm N-S x 75 cm E-W against the NW wall and within the NW third of the depository. The body was flexed and lying on its stomach and right side with its head to the west and facing south (FIG. 12). The right arm was flexed and folded beneath the body, with the palm up beneath the chest. The left arm was flexed and lying along the left side of the body. The left leg was flexed and slightly slumped out to the left side of the body, with the left foot pointing SE. The right leg was flexed beneath the body with the foot slightly behind the left foot and also pointing SE. The individual was assessed as an adult female based on epiphyseal union and the sexually di- agnostic characteristics of the innominate.</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 13, 1986 399 Burial accompaniments include at least three large ceramic sherds and, surprisingly, a number of human bones from a second individual (FIG. 12). One sherd lay in front of the face whereas fragments of one or more large sherds overlay the tightly-flexed left knee. An ad- ditional large sherd was located near the pelvis at the extreme east end of the body. As the burial was being recorded, it became evident that certain bones were clearly out of place, and these were eventually determined to belong to at least one other human individual. These include a left temporal overlying the body's left leg, an extraneous skull frag- ment near the body's left scapula and beneath the man- dible, a parietal fragment near the body's sacrum, and a rib and clavicle near the east end of the body's pelvis as well as long bone fragments immediately north and east of the body and near its left leg. From the position and disarticulated and fragmented condition of these un- articulated elements it is evident that they were inserted as isolated bones during the process of interment. The most likely explanation is that some bones from an in- dividual who died considerably earlier were collected and included as part of the burial associations. This casual attitude toward human remains is not incompati- ble with the frequent occurrence of human bones within refuse. In fact, it would appear that these two burials, though simple, actually represent relatively elaborate treatment of the dead at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke in Perspective Although numerous sites are known that probably date to the Initial Period in Peru, very few have been intensely studied or excavated. There is, therefore, a lack of spe- cific comparative material necessary to put Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke into a more general context. A begin- ning can be made, however, by using the data that are available. The Initial Period and associated advent of irrigation appear to be correlated with a proliferation of inland sites at upper valley locations optimal for canal construc- tion. Such sites or groups of sites are known from vir- tually every coastal valley between the Jequetepeque Valley in the north and the Lurin Valley in the south.21 These sites share certain other characteristics. All are dominated by one or more mounds, and these consis- tently have a U-shaped summit configuration. Addition- ally, these mounds often face up-valley; that is, the open end of the "U" appears to be oriented generally toward the source of water. Although few of these mounds have been excavated or dated, the few that yielded dates are clearly within the Initial Period. These include Huaca de las Reyes in the Moche Valley with dates of 1730 to 1190 B.C.,22 Sechin Alto in the Casma Valley (1450 B.C.),23 Huaricanga in the Fortaleza Valley (1090 B.C.),24 Garagay in the Rimac Valley (1390 to 1140 B.C.),25 and La Florida in the Rimac Valley (1810 to 1695 B.C.).26 This dating coincides well with the radiocarbon assays from Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. The consistently early dates for the known mounds make it likely that the other undated sites with a similar architectural form were also occupied during the Initial Period. The circular forecourt of the type observed at the north end of Huaca A constitutes a more specialized element common to early architecture. Preceramic examples are known,27 but like preceramic mounds, these occur only at coastal sites. Inland examples appear to be Initial Period in date or later, and they are very common in valleys from Viru south to Lurin. Among the better known sites which contain this architectural element are Tanguche in the Santa Valley,28 numerous sites in the Supe Valley,29 and Garagay in the Rimac Valley.30 There 21. M. E.

The U-shaped mound of Moxeke as well as the circular forecourt of Huaca A suggest similarities with other Initial Period inland sites. Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke is unusual, however, because of the presence and nature of Huaca A. Huaca A is clearly not a typical early U- shaped mound. In contrast to the U-shaped mounds that appear to have functioned more as temples or loci of ideological power, Huaca A had a more secular function. Both its regular multi-room summit configuration, and especially recent excavation data, strongly support this interpretation. Although aerial photographs of Initial Pe- riod inland sites have been carefully scrutinized by the authors and other archaeologists,35 there is only one example which may resemble Huaca A. This is the Casma Valley mound of Sechin Bajo, which was grouped with Huaca A on the basis of architectural form by Donald Thompson during his 1956 survey of the valley.36 This mound, along with Sechin Alto, Taukachi- Konkain, and Cerro Sechin, may be part of a larger complex of U-shaped mounds, as is also Sechin Bajo in the north branch of the Casma River.37 This suggests the existence of another settlement similar to Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke because of the presence of both temple mounds and secular mounds. Significantly, all of the early mound sites excavated have been found to contain truly monumental icono- graphic decoration. This is consistently in the form of large friezes, often polychromed, which adorn monu- mental architecture. Examples are known from the site of Limoncarro in the Jequetepeque Valley,38 Huaca de los Reyes in the Moche Valley,39 Punkurf and Cerro Blanco in the Nepefia Valley,40 the inner temple of Cerro Sechin and Sechin Alto in the Casma Valley,41 Garagay in the Rimac Valley,42 and Cardal in the Lurin Valley.43 Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke fits well within this ap- parent tradition of the use of monumental iconographic ornamentation. The friezes of Moxeke, excavated by Tello in 1937,44 have long been known, and Huaca A has also been shown to contain friezes. Most of the previously known examples, however, exhibit a common theme of colossal heads or clearly dominant human fig- ures.45 Profile felines are known from a subsidiary tem- ple at Huaca de los Reyes46 and from the inner temple of Cerro Sechin,47 which may have been a subsidiary temple within a larger mound complex. These data sug- gest that the Huaca A frieze may have functioned dif- ferently from the Moxeke figures, serving in a manner more in keeping with the secular nature of the mound. 31. R. Fung and C.

Virtually no comparative material is available to help place the aligned mounds and compounds or the domes- tic structures of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke in a broader context. Structures analogous to the aligned mounds and compounds do not appear to be present at most early mound sites, and there are no excavated examples. Since many of these are currently within the limits of modem cultivation, this may reflect a factor of preservation. The Casma Valley site of Sechin Alto, however, which is totally within cultivated fields, con- tains aligned mounds reminiscent of the Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke examples. The nearby site of Taukachi- Konka"n contains similar rows of mounds.48 The mounds at these two sites are more directly associated With the central plaza areas and do not seem to occur in indepen- dent rows. Excavated examples of securely dated Initial Period domestic architecture are known from the coastal site of Gramalote in the Moche Valley49 and the sites of Las Haldas and Tortugas on the coast near the Casma Val- ley.50 In all these cases, the architecture was of low double-faced walls of wet-laid cobbles, and this is the type of construction that characterizes the low-status architecture at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Associated platforms at Gramalote make this architectural unit slightly more elaborate, but it does not appear to be truly elite architecture. Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke as an Early State This comparison of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke with other contemporary sites has served to emphasize the potential of the site for contributing critical data on the Initial Period. Equally important, this assessment has also revealed characteristics that appear unique to Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke or the Casma Valley area. An early state level of political organization is postulated on the basis of several key features of these preliminary data. First, the degree of planning at the site suggests considerable centralized control. This is evident both in the precise layout of the non-domestic mounds and com- pounds and in their extremely consistent internal sym- metry. Second, the volume of Huaca A was doubled during the final visible construction phase. This docu- ments the mobilization of a substantial labor force to execute a carefully planned project. Third, the proposed secular storage function of Huaca A within the site sug- gests the existence of a large centralized surplus con- trolled by, and accessible only to, the site elite. Finally, the aligned mounds and compounds, which were ex- panding at the expense of domestic areas of the site, provide evidence of a proliferating bureaucracy that was probably also concerned with the control and distribution of surplus goods. The status of this group is reflected both in artifacts such as stamps and seals and in evidence for personal wealth accumulated in storerooms and subfloor chambers within areas of elite housing. In conclusion, it is important to stress that this paper provides major new data on a complex Initial Period site. In addition to better defining the crucial Initial Period epoch, the available data document the emer- gence of a very complex polity by 1500 B.c. Therefore, students of early civilization should find evidence from Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke applicable to comparative studies of early state formation within other nuclear areas of the world. 48.
