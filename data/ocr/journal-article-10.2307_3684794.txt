<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allegories of Temporality: Philippe Jaccottet and the Poetics of the Notebook Carrie Noland C'est ainsi: je suis entoure d'images, fuyantes, brisdes, sans lien entre elles, qui passent et s'effacent comme des oiseaux, et je voudrais les rassembler encore, faute de quoi, c'est moi qui m'dparpillerai avant le temps. (La Semaison, 223) Jaccottet and the Romantic Tradition Without hesitation, critics of contemporary French poetry have placed Philippe Jaccottet squarely in the tradition of German Romanticism. Ac- cording to Jean-Claude Mathieu, Jaccottet "prolongs" Romanticism (100) while for Peter Low, Jaccottet's elegiac tone and his "nostalgia for a lost plenitude" are H61derlin revisited (61). The poet himself foregrounds the Germanic influences on his work, citing Novalis, for instance, when he evokes the poetic function in La Promenade sous les arbres: "Le Paradis est dispers6 sur toute la terre, c'est pourquoi nous ne le reconnaissons plus. II faut reunir ses traits epars" (28). For most critics, this last quote has served as a kind of unofficial poetics for Jaccottet's project as a whole, one that defines writing as a gathering together of a disseminated unity. It is not surprising that Jaccot- tet would be identified as a neo-Romantic, or that he would be linked to a tradition that posits the poet as self-present visionary, scribe of the a-tem- poral transcendent "insaisissable."' What is surprising, however, is that contemporary critics would neglect to search for the kind of disruptive ironies and subversive dismantlings of the self-present subject that have recently been located in the works of Jaccottet's predecessors, Rousseau, H6lderlin and Goethe. Critical assessments that neglect to problematize Jaccottet's explicit celebrations of unity treat only one moment in a dialec- tical poetics.2 Such assessments obscure a crucial, perhaps the crucial aspect of Jaccottet's work, absenting him from critical discussions that SubStance #73, 1994 79</page><page sequence="2">80 Carrie Noland might stress his more experimental and modernist tendencies. If, as critics affirm, Jaccottet participates in a Romantic tradition, he nonetheless does so in a highly self-conscious manner. Allusions to the necessary association between writing and temporal passage, between the reassembling process and the destructive irony of sequential notation, are so frequent in Jaccottet's work that any dream of "re-uniting the scattered parts" seems a marginal rather than a central motif. The lesson of Jaccottet's poetry is not, I would argue, that "Il faut reunir [les] traits epars," but that the very unity such a poetics demands is ultimately what the writing process itself for- bids. Time and The Notebook Genre Writing obviously takes place in time, and time displaces, even as it promises an ultimate coincidence. This apprehension-always implicit in the authors to whom Jaccottet has been compared-has motivated the poet to abandon traditional lyric forms in favor of alternative forms, such as the "Carnet," or notebook. Interestingly, while the "Carnet" form is also Romantic in derivation, it has rarely been treated in any systematic manner by critics. Jaccottet's "Carnets" have not been republished for wide con- sumption by Gallimard's Podsie series, nor are they frequently taught as poetry volumes in their own right. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to treat the "Carnets" (La Semaison, Journdes and Autres journdes) as important poetic works, and more precisely, as works that interact dialectically with aspects of the lyric tradition emphasized by Jaccottet's critics. The "Carnet" forces the conventions of the lyric tradition to a point of crisis by foregrounding the inherent contradictions of a poetic idiom desiring simultaneously to reassemble and immobilize on the one hand, and to draw attention to the work of writing on the other. I shall argue that Jaccottet's notebooks constitute a quietly radical experiment in the production of poetic forms appropriate to an experience not of "full- ness," but of discontinuity. The subject of the "Carnet" form is a fractured subject, renewed and revised from day to day, continually displaced in relation to its own previous articulations. The Romantic visionary is thus blinded not by the force of his or her insight, but by the sheer repetition of the gesture of looking, a repetition that ultimately scatters the writing subject into an infinite number of never completely identical fragments ("c'est moi qui m'eparpillerai avant le temps"). SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="3">Poetics of the Notebook 81 A reading of my epigraph from La Semaison is perhaps the best place to begin. The theme of "rassemblement" appears prominently here--"je suis entoure d'images ... et je voudrais les rassembler encore"-but so does its contrary, the theme of scattering, or "eparpillement." Assembling and dispersing are not two separate themes, but rather the necessary poles of a single thematic that serves to convey Jaccottet's epistemology.3 Further, they are structural terms designating two ways of conceiving the poetic act: either one foregrounds the collection of perceptual fragments into a single lineated container-the poem as we traditionally conceive it--or else one foregrounds the mutability of perception by presenting' the fragments in amorphous groupings, as in the "Carnets." The notebook form draws at- tention to the heterogeneity of consciousness (and thus to the scattering of the subject) in a way that the finished poem may suggest, but not material- ize graphically. At the root of this cognitive displacement is, according to Jaccottet, the experience of temporal passage; an effort to make sense of the world, to see in its fullest sense, reveals only the belatedness of under- standing. The struggle to unite involves danger; as the poet demonstrates through the reflexive construction "m'eparpiller," the perceptual act can, if prolonged, shatter the perceiving self. Perception and Cognition An asymptotic pattern of experience and image is, in fact, implied by Jaccottet's formulation, "je m'eparpillerai avant le temps." The founding principle of Jaccottet's epistemology is that full cognition is belated in relation to organic perception. Because time passes so quickly, or simply because time passes, we cannot grasp whatever it is we are perceiving. In contrast, Cartesian epistemology suggests it is the luxury of time itself that will eventually afford us absolute knowledge, or the "clear and distinct ideas" with which Descartes is obsessed in Meditations on First Philosophy. The final lines of Descartes's Sixth Meditation present the coveted "clear and distinct ideas" (the opposite of Jaccottet's "images fuyantes") as poten- tially attainable; the philosopher need only set aside enough time to ap- prehend them: "because the need to get things done does not always give us the leisure time for such a careful inquiry, one must believe that the life of man is vulnerable to errors regarding particular things, and we must acknowledge the infirmity of our nature" (100, my emphasis). In Descartes's world, knowing is merely a matter of "careful inquiry" made possible by "leisure time" (an epistemology to which the over-bur- SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="4">82 Carrie Noland dened professor also subscribes). In other words, the adequately sustained gaze should-if only our nature allowed-produce a clear and distinct idea of the truth. Jaccottet, even less certain, rewrites the Cartesian romance as a tragedy: time is once again central to the epistemological narrative, but here, it passes too quickly and scatters the hero into frag- ments. Of course, in the context of the notebooks, the goal of perception is not described as absolute knowledge, but as poetic verbalization, which is, in a teleological poetics, the same thing. The author of La Semaison obvious- ly wants to get it right, to integrate the disparate images into a poem ("reunir [les] traits epars"), and inhabit a lyric subjectivity capable of rendering the world on paper. The poet's desire for a transcendent vision explains his repeated forays into articulation, the numerous revisions that compose the notebook series. The implicit wager of the notebook is that repetition and the passage of time will indeed provide a verbal image that coincides at least allegorically with the perceived visual image. However, in Jaccottet's notebook series, time proves to be an obstruction, rather than a catalyst. The text, as well as the subject, is dispersed as the pen responds to temporal passage. We can understand Jaccottet's attraction to the notebook form, then, in terms of his tragic epistemology. A constructed poem is a false epiphany; a series of unfinished notebook sketches, on the other hand, does capture something, if only the imprint of time itself. Revision and Incertitude Throughout his career as a poet, Jaccottet has composed and compiled notebooks. In fact, until recently he regularly published fragments of the "Carnets" in tandem with, or in counterpart to, volumes of lyric poetry. The first edition of La Semaison: Carnets, published in 1963, covers the years during which he wrote L'Ignorant (1958) and the first poems of Airs (1967). While he composed the additions to La Semaison (augmented to include entries up to 1979) he also finished Airs and Leqons (1969). But since 1983, the year Pensees sous les nuages was published, a new volume of poetry has not appeared.4 The poet himself explains this asymmetry between the publishing of notebooks and lyric forms as the result of a debilitating "incertitude." In a recent conversation, Jaccottet explained to me that the process of writing itself had begun to preoccupy him; during the composi- tion of Pensdes sous les nuages, for instance, manuscripts proliferated, the spontaneity of composition was overwhelmed by the need to revise. "A partir des Pensqes sous les nuages," Jaccottet remarks, SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="5">Poetics of the Notebook 83 je travaille davantage.... L~ [in Pensees], j'avais des manuscrits plus abondants, j'ai supprim t beaucoup. Je ne trouve pas que pour moi cela soit un trbs bon signe, de travailler davantage. C'est la preuve plut6t d'une esp&amp;ce d'incertitude. (Interview. Oct. 17, 1989) Although Jaccottet tends to view his increasing self-consciousness in a negative light, it is possible to see the "incertitude" to which he alludes as the inevitable--and ultimately productive--outcome of a poetics based on a fidelity to observation. The poet's preoccupation with the revision process, especially as it is realized in the "Carnets," does not, in fact, signal an inadequacy on the part of the poet so much as it reveals his desire to avoid poetic cliches and commonplaces. If, as opposed to the Surrealists, the poet rejects the most immediately available structures of expression, and yet resists the imposition of a classical and therefore alien form, then he does risk creating a poetic surface that is both uneven and interrupted. Jaccottet's professed "incertitude"-and even more importantly, his will- ingness to foreground this "incertitude" in his poetic work-are rather signs of his participation in a collective experience of modernity. That reality is temporally rather than aesthetically constructed is the major revelation of the Jaccottean notebook. The subject of this notebook is, ac- cordingly, not the full subject of Cartesian epistemology, but the dispersed subject of seasonal change (the writing subject of La Semaison). Or alterna- tively, in Julia Kristeva's less organic terminology, Jaccottet's subject is not a transcendent "sujet unaire," but a "sujet en procks," a being caught in time, and therefore in the dialectic of negativity that founds consciousness itself.5 Multiple Subjectivities and Impersonalization Jaccottet's notebooks are composed of a heterogeneous set of materials. The poet includes strings of discrete descriptive verse poems or "pohmes en prose," each of which rewrites the former versions, along with accounts of daily events, favorite quotes from other writers, and aphorisms. Most interesting from an aesthetic standpoint are the sections in which Jaccottet attempts to pin down a precise moment in a revision sequence, recording the passage of time as it is reflected in the landscape before his eyes. In these sections Jaccottet rejects the finished lyric form in favor of the trial, or "tentative." The intensity of poetic revelation is scattered over time, and a narrative emerges that is not so much the story of a particular place, SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="6">84 Carrie Noland but an allegory of the writing process itself (process understood here in its etymological sense-from the Latin processus--meaning simply "lapse of time"). Referring to the hivernal aspects of a pastoral scene in an entry from La Semaison, Jaccottet suggests an apt analogy for the perceiving self as it exists temporally: On voit encore ces choses, et on ne les voit plus comme des choses, mais comme 6manations, iddes, figures, mouvements, naissances. (70, my em- phasis) The analogy Jaccottet implies here is between the scene itself, the "things" one is looking at ("Glace, lames, feuilles de givre"), and the speaking subject, which the act of looking reduces to an impersonal "one." "On voit encore"--"one" looks again, and what "one" sees is no longer a frozen world of things, but rather the coming-into-being of a world in movement. I emphasize the word encore in this passage because it is our key to under- standing Jaccottet's poetics of the notebook. The notebook form records the second look, the movement of negativity or self-correction, thereby captur- ing that slight dicalage between two moments of experience. Jaccottet's personal pronoun, "one," underscores the process which, in fact, de-per- sonalizes the subjectivity of the observer, scattering him into multiple sub- jectivities, each linked to a successive moment of perception. As I have been suggesting, there is indeed an important causal relationship between viewing, reviewing, and the dissemination of the writer's subjectivity. Jac- cottet intimates such a connection in the epigraphic citation to this essay: "je voudrais les rassembler encore, faute de quoi, c'est moi qui m'eparpil- lerai avant le temps" (223, my emphasis). The Influence of Ponge While there is a long history of notebook-writing by poets (among the more famous examples cited by Jaccottet are Goethe, Baudelaire, and Rilke), the particular nature of Jaccottet's "Carnets" indicates unequivocal- ly the influence of Francis Ponge. Jaccottet has named this influence in essays and interviews,6 claiming that he admired and attempted to emulate Ponge's "gofit du concret." What he appreciated in Ponge's materialist poetics was, in Jaccottet's own words, la volont6 d'etre tr!s pros de ce qui est le plus proche pour 6viter la ten- dance de la poesie s'&amp;chapper trop loin dans l'insaissisable .... il [Ponge] a ramend le regard sur les choses proches. Cela m'a &amp;td profond~ment SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="7">Poetics of the Notebook 85 sensible et, d'une certaine manibre, m'a encourage dans cette direction. (Interview) It is no coincidence that Jaccottet's first contact with Francis Ponge in 1946 coincided with a sudden interest in landscape description, a concern with verbal betrayal, and the discovery of a new method involving the notebook-like exposure of each state of the poem's production. In fact, the long personal and professional relationship Jaccottet established with Ponge contributed forcefully to the development of Jaccottet's poetics of the notebook. Employed by the editor Mermod in 1946, Jaccottet was sent to Paris to represent the Swiss publishing company and to negotiate with its French clients. In this function, Jaccottet met Francis Ponge and worked as an editor for Le Carnet du bois de pins and La Rage de l'expression, published by Mermod in 1947 and 1952, respectively. In 1953, Jaccottet stopped working for Mermod and moved to the small village of Grignan in the Drome. Outside of Paris, closer to the "choses paysannes" to which Ponge had encouraged him to "ramene[r] le regard," Jaccottet underwent a transfor- mation that paralleled Ponge's of a few years earlier. Both poets proceeded from short lyrics or prose poems to the notebook form, in which revisions of the same poem could be arranged in a series and published together. Ponge and Le Carnet du bois de pins Beginning Le Carnet du bois de pins during a military leave in 1940, Ponge departed from his earlier methods and initiated a series of en- deavors that both he and his critics would later characterize as anti-poetic.7 Unlike his earlier volumes, Le Parti pris des choses (1945) and Dix Cours sur la mithode (1946), the Carnet is not composed of a series of discrete prose poems, each focusing on the evocation of a different "thing." There is only one thematic focus in the Carnet: the pine woods named in the title. Each notebook entry--dated August 7 to September 9, 1940-contains one or more revisions of a kernel poetic description of these pine trees. In the Carnet, Ponge names the notebook entries "meditations" (19), thereby em- phasizing the tentative, evolutionary, and philosophical nature of the project. The appeal of such a project for Ponge was obviously great; while Jaccottet continued to write short lyrics even as he compiled his notebooks, Ponge chose to adopt exclusively the notebook procedure of close descrip- tion within formal variation during the rest of his career as a poet. The SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="8">86 Carrie Noland practice of exposing various revisions of the same basic poetic material became, in effect, his trademark. What attracted both Jaccottet and Ponge to the notebook form was not that it promised greater intimacy between the poet and the reader-the notebook understood here as an access to the "arribre-histoire" of the poem-but rather, the fact that such a form stressed the effort and not the goal, the "tentative" and not the product.8 Jaccottet also borrowed Ponge's concept of exchange as an epistemological principle. Ponge writes in Le Carnet du bois de pin, for example, that Si nous sommes entr6s dans la familiarit6 de ces cabinets particuliers de la nature [the "bois de pins"], s'ils en ont acquis la chance de naitre A la parole, ce n'est pas seulement pour que nous rendions anthropomorphiquement compte de ce plaisir sensuel, c'est pour qu'il en rdsulte une co-naissance plus s4rieuse. (31) What transpires in, and perhaps because of, the writing of the "Carnet" is an exchange, a "co-naissance plus s6rieuse" in which both the poem (as a human or "anthropomorphic" linguistic production) and the mute in- human "cabinets particuliers de la nature" are preserved. Nature's birth to language, Ponge claims, involves a simultaneous birth of the subject to language, and hence, a co-birth and a "connaissance" as well. Again, what Ponge stresses here is the causal connection between observation and iden- tity, remarking and being marked, writing and subjectivity. This is precise- ly the aspect of the Pongean notebook that Jaccottet adopts for his own work. In Jaccottet's own words, the entries of his "Carnets" are, like Ponge's descriptions, "n6s d'un &amp;change avec [des] paysages," in this case, the "paysages" of Jaccottet's Grignon (Vidal, 107). In Jaccottet's work, the notion of exchange takes on a slightly different tonality than it has in the Carnet. For Ponge, the exchange is subordinated to the goal of "possession"; the Pongean observer seeks to know, to capture and record the definitive and timeless "qualit6 propre" of the object or scene.9 On the other hand, an awareness of time is not entirely lacking in Le Carnet du bois de pins. Ponge is careful to date his notebook entries, relating each version of the pine woods to an exact moment in time. However, it is the eternal "qualit6 propre au bois" that Ponge is after, and not its ephemeral aspect. The forest exists as if suspended in time, or else in snapshot-like fashion, at representative moments of the calendar year. The action of time on place is not central to Ponge as it is to Jaccottet. Ponge's subjective re-births are punctual, discrete, completed. Accordingly, his "qualites de chaque chose" turn out to be a-temporal and therefore essen- tially mythic constructions, just as the writing subject proves to be present SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="9">Poetics of the Notebook 87 in the text not as an evolving subjectivity, but rather in the static form of a signature. Although in the Carnet Ponge calls for a text that will be, like the trees that are its pretext, a "monument vivant," both "un etre et une statue" (57), it is the younger poet who, in his own "Carnets," provides the model for a writing process that takes into account the full weight of being-in- time. Jaccottet and Man's Temporal Destiny The titles of Jaccottet's works themselves imply a different focus. While Ponge names his poetic volumes after literary categories, Douze Petits Ecrits, Le Grand Recueil, Le Nouveau Recueil, Tome premier, all of which privilege the textual over the material, Jaccottet names his volumes after natural or chronological phenomena: La Semaison, Journees, Autres journees, A travers un verger. In Ponge's writing the emphasis is on the observed object's birth to language; in Jaccottet's work, on the other hand, the impact of observation on language, and on the subject employing this language, is stressed. Ultimately, the qualities of the object observed are less significant than how this object reflects temporal passage, and thus, the subject's mortality. Writing, for Jaccottet, is an activity that invests the subject in the scene or in the object observed to the point where this subject becomes vulnerable; the subject realizes what Paul de Man has called man's "authentically temporal destiny," experiencing through a visual exercise not the transformation of life into text, but the self's implication in a chang- ing material world. For Jaccottet, there is no end to the birth process, no completed exchange, but rather a self-perpetuating textual production that parallels, like an allegory, the self-perpetuating and self-mutating process of looking itself. Ultimately, Jaccottet rejects Ponge's "qualite propre," just as he doubts the existence of Yves Bonnefoy's "vrai lieu."'0 In his work temporality is not a dimension detached from phenomena, frustrating our accession to it, but rather, time is what composes the material world; it constitutes our vision, it is, ultimately, what we see. In a brief poem from Airs, for example, temporality itself assumes a visual identity: "Feuilles ou 6tincelles de la mer/ ou temps qui brille 6parpille" (my emphasis). Here the moving multi- plicities of wave or leaf offer themselves to the comprehension as glittering and scattered reflections of time. Or again, a copse of cypress trees in La Semaison presents another graphic rendering of temporality as light: "Je SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="10">88 Carrie Noland crois que ce qui s'allume ici [in the tops of the trees] c'est le temps, c'est sa course-comme il s'enflamme en toute chose jeune" (210). Nature as a Mirror of Time In much of Jaccottet's poetry the natural world is experienced as a kind of mirror of time, a surface against which time can be perceived in action. Inevitably, when the writer tries to record time as it permeates the landscape around him, the writing process itself is affected. Since writing is an act that evolves, the writing subject-the 'I" who records-becomes the witness of its own decentering. Just as the landscape is incrementally altered by temporal displacement, so the consciousness of the writing sub- ject is scattered and deferred from self-coincidence, as a result of a momen- tary but repeated investment in the various images observed. While there are dozens of scenes recorded in the "Carnets" that follow this basic for- mula-the attempt to record a scene, recognition of the passage of time, scattering of subjectivity-I have chosen to look more closely at one situated near the beginning of La Semaison, bearing only the title "Octobre." It contains the description of a highly conventional poetic scene: a colorful sunset. While presumably an attempt to capture the "qualitis de chaque chose," the entry ends up insisting on both the instability of the landscape and the transitory efficacy of the words used to describe it. By sustaining a tension between immediate reference, indicated by repeated deictic con- structions, and belatedness, described as the imminent erasure of the words themselves, the entry highlights the intimate relationships Jaccottet establishes between place, consciousness, and temporality.

Le jour n'habite plus que l'extreme hauteur du ciel. Nous tournons le dos au soleil. Nuages mauves, lilas. Papier presque bleu. Un feu qui s'eteint. Je ne vois presque plus les mots. (19-20) The many deictics of the passage-"Ce soir," "Voici," "maintenant"- are reinforced by references to the scene of writing-"Je ne vois presque plus les mots"-a tactic which usually foregrounds the author's presence to his own text. But here the mode of deixis is accompanied by numerous reminders of temporal passage: 1) the adverbs of acceleration and belated- ness ("vite," "ddjA," "bient6t"); 2) the numerous verbs whose semes all have to do with movement or change ("changer," "milrir," "foncer," "passer," "devenir"); 3) the adjective "presque," which suggests imminent metamorphosis; and finally, 4) the use of the future tense, as in "empechera." Interestingly, the personal pronoun does not appear until darkness has descended upon the external scene and the writer is forced to move inward: "Je ne vois presque plus les mots." The absence of an articu- lated writing subject during most of the passage is telling; it is as if the subjectivity of the observer had been dispersed into the many fragmented perceptions his pen is recording. The light that gilds the trees and the clouds also touches the notebook-"Intimit6 de la lumitre dans la chambre"-increasing its luminosity even as the poet writes in it. Jaccottet's use of the word "intimit6" suggests that alterations of illumination affect not only the scene being described, but also the materials of its documentation. This light is the visible sign of that which is most intimate to all elements of the verbal occasion: the passage of time. For light in Jaccottet's poetry, as I have noted, is time, and La Semaison is a record of the manifestations of time as light, of time as glittering displacements, or "etincelles." The words on the page are infused with this changing light and, accordingly, can possess only a temporary representational relevance. From white to pink to blue to darkness-this is the temporality of the page, writing's maturation, what art critic Norman Bryson has called "the durational temporality of the performance" (92).11 Now the page is white; now it is pink; now it is blue. The writer does not need to repeat the subject pronoun at each stage; deictic constructions and references to the changing light plot a series of points along a temporal continuum that establish the optical organ, as well as the transcribing hand, in real historical time. The act of reading reconstructs a time-line, each point of which is represented by another textual fragment. In this way, it is possible to see the "Carnets" as an SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="12">90 Carrie Noland allegory of time itself, the sequence of textual moments referring to a homologous sequence of temporal moments. It is axiomatic that, like a brushmark on a canvas, each enunciation of the notebook entry coincides with a moment of observation, and, therefore, with a visual event. The visual event, however, has no absolute identity, but rather a protean one; the viewing subject cannot be defined in this exchange except as a continually changing, aging entity. Accordingly, it is not until both the scene and its verbal transcription are plunged into obscurity ("Je ne vois presque plus les mots") that the personal pronoun returns. The lack of light (that period during which time is not marked by light cues) seems to permit the personal pronoun to emerge. Curiously, at this point two things happen: 1) the poet begins a metaphorical description of the stars, and 2) he evokes a series of intertextual references: Elever une fois de plus l'ornement sur la nuit, l'abime. Ornement reve: A la fois savant et musical, ferme et sourd, vaste et cache. Moddles: H6lderlin, Leopardi, quelques pokmes de Baudelaire. (20) It is clear that we have moved out of the linear temporality of twilight--the minute and incremental differences between light values- into cosmic time. This second temporal pattern, the cosmic, is appropriate to the constellations, to the dream ("Ornement rev4"), to the repeated raising of a monument ("Elever une fois de plus"), and finally, to the intertextual ("Modbles: Hdlderlin, Leopardi, quelques poemes de Baudelaire"). Unlike the earlier section of "Octobre," this paragraph propels the "Je" of "Je ne vois presque plus les mots" toward a timeless identity assured by membership in a literary pantheon, a 'T"Pliade" in all senses. The consciousness of the moment, guarded so tenaciously up to now, is eclipsed here in favor of a collective and monumentalizing poetic subjectivity. However, true to the anti-monumentalizing project of the "Carnets," the poet rejects this solution at the close of the entry: Reserves (absurdes bien sor!): sur les allkgories et les pens~es de Leopardi, la tension de H61derlin, les attitudes de Baudelaire. Autre chose devrait etre tent6 peut-ktre .. 12 Absurd or not, Jaccottet listens to his own reservations, dismisses the available topoi, and resumes the quest for an "Autre chose" suggested by the "detail et espace" he will end by interrogating: Autre chose devrait etre tente peut-6tre, oi trouvent accord non pas paisible, mais vivant, lgbret` et gravit6, r(alit6 et mystere, detail et espace.

Des entrevisions infiniment fragiles ... on est pench- sur une SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="13">Poetics of the Notebook 91 besogne modeste, et soudain on se rappelle la profondeur de l'espace et du temps. Apparently the "other thing" one might try to accomplish through writing, has something to do with a sudden recollection of "la profondeur de l'espace et du temps" by means of a series of "entrevisions infiniment fragiles." As opposed to the conventional monumentalizing structures of lyric poetry, Jaccottet advances an "entrevision," a between visions, a spatialization of visions and a writing of these spaces. The written surface is thus a monument only to its own inevitable irrelevance. Perhaps all poetry is such a monument, more self-consciously so since Mallarm&amp;. However, the Jaccottean notebook tends to foreground the negativity at play in the conventional poetics of the monument through its unique formal organization. As a form, then, the notebook stands at the limit of the poetic, in an interspace that allows it to accentuate the very poetic properties- ephiphanic immediacy, verbal "justesse," subjective self-coincidence-it threatens to negate. Conclusion We have followed a certain itinerary here, one which can be sum- marized if we return briefly to the sequence of personal pronouns that appear in the text quoted earlier. From the complete investment of the subject in passing moments of time-let us say, the subject of phenomenal temporality-we progress to the full subjectivity of an idealized, literary '"Je"-the subject of textual a-temporality. This full subject in turn is rejected in favor of the impersonal "on" of "on est penche sur une besogne modeste." We have seen this subject before, in the fragment from La Semaison quoted at the beginning of this essay: "On voit encore ces choses, et on ne les voit plus comme des choses, mais comme emanations, idles, figures, mouvements, naissances." This "on" is the impersonal pronoun of the second look, the reappraisal of self-consciousness that renders articu- late an experience of fragmentation. Unlike the other subjects-the ab- sented subject of the description and the "Je" of reflection-the "on" is emptied of anything but time. The voice of the "one" sees only time, is saturated by time, is time. In this way, and in this way alone, can it be said that the subject is ever authentically-and not fictionally--"one." The temporality this "one" at once apprehends and represents is not the linear temporality of deictic markers, but temporality as a dimension, a matter in which one floats, a kind of space. Space and time tend to collapse SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="14">92 Carrie Noland in Jaccottet's work; his favorite trope, for instance, that of "passage," con- nects movement through space and through time by means of a metaphori- cal slippage (one metaphorically "passes" through time in both French and English usage). However, to achieve this sense of complete identification with "la profondeur de l'espace et du temps," the writer must begin with the minute recording, the "modeste besogne" which the notebook form supports. In other words, to achieve an authentic unity, one paradoxically engages in a practice that breaks down constructions of the self. Thus, Jaccottet's figure for subjectivity has nothing to do with spatial security, with a "vrai lieu" decorated with either personal or collective symbols. On the contrary, the space of the subject in Jaccottet's work is located at the point where the cut is made between two spaces: "D'une certaine manibre, nous ne sommes reels que dans la rencontre du present: 1l o0h la proue fend l'eau" (La Semaison, 110). Being on the interface, on the fold, at the orifice-these are all postmodern metaphors for the experience of subjectivity; they are metaphors that can be found in Jaccottet's work as well. The string of alliterative monosyllables-"lI oti la proue fend l'eau"-is highly unusual in Jaccottet's idiom. The stuttering rhythm of this hemistich in an otherwise seamless prose style foregrounds the importance of the image we are being offered. For Jaccottet, we reach some under- standing of our "authentically temporal destiny" only by breaking the surface, moving forward continually, rewriting and revising. We are closest to revelation when we break with what we were, when we are in a state of rupture. The text can imitate through allegory this movement of difference by rupturing or rewriting itself. By exposing the successive stages of textual production, the writer makes himself present to his work just as this work-by revising itself-scatters him into fragments. University of California, Irvine NOTES 1. Jean Onimus's book on Jaccottet, for instance, is subtitled Une poitique de l'insaisissable (Seyssel: Champ Vallon, 1982). 2. Richard Stamelman has written eloquently on the lack of a fixed center-un- derstood spatially--in Jaccottet's work, but he has not explored the effect of this spatial instability on either the subjective voice or on poetic form ("Landscape and Loss in Yves Bonnefoy and Philippe Jaccottet," French Forum, 5, 1980). 3. Such an epistemology resembles the one Baudelaire presents in his own carnet, Mon coeur mis A nu. The Baudelairean subject, in search of the self-reflexivity a carnet both dramatizes and records, is also at once scattered ("vaporisation") and united SubStance #73, 1994</page><page sequence="15">Poetics of the Notebook 93 ("centralisation"), as is indicated in the following aphorism: "De la vaporisation et de la centralisation du Moi. Tout est IA" (Oeuvres completes [Paris: Gallimard, Pleiade, 1961],1271). 4. A few exceptions: "Deux po&amp;mes d'4t6," Le Monde March 7,1986; "Fragments de madrigaux," La Revue de Belles Lettres, no. 3-4, March 1987; "Le tissu bleu du ciel," "Vert, rose et bleu," Sud (Marseilles), no. 80-81, March 1989. 5. See "Le Sujet en procks" in Polylogue (Paris: Seuil, 1977). I do not want to map Kristeva's Hegelian/Lacanian reading of Antonin Artaud directly onto Jaccottet; I merely want to suggest the elasticity of her model, and the potential it has for opening up new readings of Jaccottet's work. 6. See "Sur un Malherbe" in Jaccottet's L'Entretien des muses and "Cette folie de se livrer nuit et jour A une oeuvre" in Une Transaction secrete (Paris: Gallimard, 1987). Jaccottet also winks in Ponge's direction when he prefaces La Semaison with a quote from Ponge's favorite reading matter, the Littre dictionary. 7. See J.-M. Gleize, Francis Ponge (Paris, Seuil, 1988) and Philippe Sollers, Entretiens de Francis Ponge avec Philippe Sollers (Paris, Gallimard/Seuil, 1970). 8. The word "tentative" is Ponge's own; it first appears in a letter Ponge ap- pended to the Carnet. Referring to a friend ("G.A.") who had read but apparently misunderstood the manuscript, Ponge insists, "il n'a pas compris (evidemment) qu'il s'agit, au coin de ce bois, bien moins de la naissance d'un po~me que d'une tentative (bien loin d'etre reussie) d'assassinat d'un po!me par son objet" (Le Carnet du bois de pins p. XIV, Ponge's emphasis). 9. " .. . pour que l'homme prenne vraiment possession de la nature, pour qu'il la dirige, la soumette, il faut qu'il cumule en lui les qualites de chaque chose (rien de mieux A cet effet que de les d gager par la parole, de les nominer)" (La Rage de l'expression [36], Ponge's emphasis). 10. Unlike his contemporary, Yves Bonnefoy, Jaccottet is not ultimately con- vinced of the existence of a "vrai lieu" that would furnish the stage for an extended epiphany. According to Jaccottet, Bonnefoy is too frequently seduced by aesthetic models; his landscapes are "scenes" rather than "vrais lieux;" the energy of experience is concentrated into emblems rather than dispersed into the patternless variety of metonymic detail (see Jaccottet's "Vers le vrai lieu" in L'Entretien des muses). 11. Bryson is referring here to the pictorial performance, to the signs left on the canvas of the artist's physical movements. Bryson associates an emphasis on praxis (the temporality of production) with the aesthetic of the "glance"; the process of viewing is itself included as a retrievable element of the painting. 12. Jaccottet's fear of the intertextual is well-known. On page 89 of La Semaison he writes, "Comment saisir quoi que ce soit. A peine a-t-on rav6 que d'autres reveurs vous bousculent."
