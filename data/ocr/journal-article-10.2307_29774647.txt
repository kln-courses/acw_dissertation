<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Scientists' Bookshelf Interpreting the Honeybee's Dance Anatomy of a Controversy: The Ques? tion of "Language" Among Bees. Adrian M. Wenner and Patrick H. Wells. 399 pp. Columbia University Press, 1990. $55. In 1967, Adrian Wenner (joined in 1969 by Patrick Wells) began publishing a se? ries of articles arguing that the honeybee dance language discovered in 1945 by Karl von Frisch was, in fact, not a lan? guage at all. Wenner and Wells agreed that the intricate maneuver performed by some retaining foragers encodes the dis? tance and direction of the food source just visited, that some of the potential recruits attending these dances depart the hive al? most immediately, and that some of those bees subsequently turn up at the food. But to them, the idea that a mere insect might have an abstract language, second only to human speech in its ability to encode in? formation, was unlikely; instead, they ar? gued, it is more plausible that bees, like many other insects, use olfactory cues to locate food. For this to be true, the correla? tions would have to be spurious artifacts, and von Frisch's experiments (for which he was to win the Nobel Prize in 1973) would have had to have been inconclu? sive and misleading. Wenner and Wells presented results of their own experi? ments that seemed to prove that odor was sufficient to account for directed recruit? ment of bees, and stirred up a widely fol? lowed controversy that was played out in the pages of Science and Nature. I remember the early days of the dance language controversy very clearly. I was in a course on animal behavior taught by ^^^HR^ "^^bbH^b^b^b^b^bI Worker bee exposes its Nasanov (aggregating pheromone) gland. From Anatomy of A Controversy. Seymour Benzer. He suggested that two of us debate the issue before the class, and I wound up being assigned to the Wenner and Wells side. To my surprise I found that, with a single exception, none of von Frisch's experiments controlled adequately for olfactory cues; the one that seemed to be conclusive was contradicted by an ap? parently identical test by Wenner and Wells. Benzer challenged the class to de? vise unambiguous tests of the alternative hypotheses, chose the most promising can? didates, and asked their authors to formu? late a consensus experiment and try it that summer. Thus it was that Mike Henerey, Mike MacLeod and I set off for the desert of eastern Oregon in 1969. We performed two sets of experiments, each of which seemed to confirm the idea of a dance lan? guage, although they did not support von Frisch's enthusiastic assertion that recruits "fly rapidly and with certainty to the indi? cated flowers, even when these are kilome? ters away." In fact, most recruits failed to locate a station on their first try, successful recruits required several minutes to locate a station only a few seconds away, and some recruits located the food without at? tending a dance. At the same time, as we read more and more of von Frisch's writ? ings, we came to understand just how dif? ferent the apparently similar experiments of Wenner and Wells really were, and how rnisleadingly selective they had been in their citations of von Frisch. The last experimental paper of sub? stance from Wenner and Wells appeared in 1971, followed by their last important review in 1973. In these papers they sug? gested that unique locale odors brought back on the bodies of returning foragers might be the cue that enables recruits to find the food; later they also argued that odors left in the air by commuting for? agers could establish an aerial trail for re? cruits to follow (although why the wind should not disperse this hypothetical ol? factory highway was never explained). Ei? ther of these possibilities could account for the results of any previous experiment. Only a test in which foragers visited one 278 American Scientist, Volume 80</page><page sequence="2">location but specified another in their dance could establish whether or not bees can use the distance and direction infor? mation in the dance. I discovered a way to manage this trick and found that I could "aim" recruits at any point in an array of feeding stations regardless of where the foragers were actually going. Once again I found that some recruits apparently used odor alone and, therefore, turned up at the forager station, and that successful re? cruits required several minutes to locate even nearby feeding sites. Given that foragers can be made to "lie" about food location, and that a large proportion of the recruits arrive at the lo? cation specified by that lie, it might seem hard to find much more to say about the issue of whether bees have a language. But this is a matter of perspective: We are told at the outset of this book by Wenner and Wells that whereas the bee-language debate was "one of the century's most im? portant controversies in biology," it was only "ostensibly" about the dance; in? stead, it was really about the deeper na? ture of science and, indeed, most of their book deals with their ideas about how to "do" science. Controversies, we are in? formed, never turn on facts, but rather "center on social and political issues." Be? sides, they tell us, science is powerless to prove anything, and so we "may never know" whether bees have a dance lan? guage. Those that do entertain the possi? bility of dance communication are victims of "the rise of 'New Age' thinking" or un? fettered anthropomorphism, unable to see forager-recruit encounters as anything but "human-level interactions." When Wenner and Wells do finally turn to the many experiments that bear on the issue, two problems become immediately apparent. The first is that they insist that bees either use the dance information or use odor; as Wenner put it in his earlier (1971) and largely similar book, The Bee Language Controversy: An Experience in Sci? ence, "one cannot have it both ways." But one of the most important lessons we have learned from bees is that animals fre? quently do have it both ways, or even sev? eral ways. Alternative "failsafe" behav? ioral mechanisms for accomplishing critical tasks are more the rule than the ex? ception; bees, for instance, can navigate using the sun's azimuth, polarization pat? terns in the sky, or their memory of land? marks. Showing that some bees use an odor-based strategy under one set of cir? cumstances, therefore, does not a priori ex? clude the possibility that they use a lan? guage under others, and vice versa. The other problem is that the presenta? tion of the various experiments in this book is consistently misleading and some? times mistaken; only a reader who has read some of the original literature (or a comprehensive review by someone other than Wenner and Wells) will be able to spot the omissions, twistings and outright errors that characterize this analysis? omissions like the failure to tell us that Wenner and Wells regularly used tech? niques that rnirtimized or blocked dancing (leading von Frisch to comment acidly that "it is a pity that Johnson [a student of Wen? ner] tried to investigate the importance of dancing with bees that never or seldom danced at all"); twistings like their analysis of von Frisch's 1945 experiments in which they equate bees counted (perhaps several times each) at some stations with bees cap? tured and removed from action at others; errors like their mistaken description of the misdirection technique, the method that lies behind the experiments that ended the dance-language controversy for nearly ev? eryone else. Other reviews consider the important effects of variant techniques, the difference between measuring recruitment to a point source (a feeding station) versus a flower patch (the normal challenge bees face, and to which the temperate-zone dance has evolved), and summarize some of the experiments that, curiously, Wenner and Wells complain that no one has ever done. Indeed, the reader cannot help but wonder why the authors, who are so criti? cal of the work of others and the many glaring lacunas in the data that could sup? port their hypotheses, have not troubled themselves to perform any relevant exper? iments in more than two decades; of course, if they really believe that science ultimately cannot prove anything, and is actually controlled by sinister social and political forces beyond anyone's control, their attitude toward futher experimenta? tion is less mysterious. My favorite part of the Wenner and Wells "dissection" of the dance controver? sy is the section that outlines what they seem to see as a coordinated plot to dis? credit them. Although there is no second gunman, and Jack Ruby doesn't come into it at all, it's a wonderful conspiracy story. It involves W. P. Stephen (someone I've never met, but with whom I discover from Wenner and Wells I worked for "some ... time"), Seymour Benzer, Donald Griffin, Peter Marler, Bert H?lldobler, E. O. Wil? son, Robert Sinsheimer, Mark Konishi and others. My colleagues will especially enjoy the episode in which Konishi (a former student of Marler) was hired by Caltech (home to Sinsheimer and Benzer) for, it would seem, the sole purpose of creating a job for me at Princeton as a reward for my part in the operation. If you want to know how the rest of the cast is implicated in this rococo maneuver, you will have to read their 11th chapter.?James L.
