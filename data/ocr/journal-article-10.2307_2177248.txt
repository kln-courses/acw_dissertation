Ph., XXX, 4, pp. 357-395; XXXI, I, PP. 57-86. The conclusion of the previous article was that the evaluation of a content as real depended upon its connection in a systematic whole with other con- tents already adjudged real. This is accomplished by means of four kinds of association: similar and dissimilar, simultaneous and successive. By means of these associations, the sensuously given is formed into a contin- uous whole, by connection with which a particular content is adjudged real. The different senses have different values for the consciousness of reality. The visual perception is most important in regard to quantity, for most of our perceptions are visual, and we can have several visual percep- tions at once. Qualitatively also they are superior to the others, since they come to us in a definite order, thus forming a continuous manifold which facilitates the associative process. Tactual perceptions are of less impor- tance, since they are less delicate, less easily localized, less easily isolated. But they have a high ' reality value,' as is shown by the common phrases, ' to grasp a thing,' ' hard matters of fact,' etc. Furthermore, they are but little liable to illusion ; they last, and can be verified at times when visual perceptions cannot. Auditory perceptions contribute to ' reality value' by informing us concerning the origin of sounds, but they are inferior to the tactual, since we often disregard the objective reference, as in the case of music. Smell and taste, owing to their lack of localization power, contribute very little to the estimation of reality. That they contribute anything is evidence that perception in itself implies reality. Cornelius's theory of the reality evaluation of reproduced contents cannot be accepted, because it presupposes what it seeks to explain, resolving itself into the circular argu- 56o</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 56i ment, that to take for real means to expect certain sensations, and to expect means to take for real in the future. Secondly, he seeks to make the evaluation of a content as real dependent upon an event which itself is not considered real. Thirdly, his explanation does not agree with the ob- served facts. And, finally, he makes the fundamental error of supposing that space can have a reality value independent of objects. There are three kinds of direct motives or conditions involved in the process of judg- ing a content to be real: (i) the present or previous perception of the con- tent in question ; (2) inferences drawn from previous perception; (3) reliable sources of information. There are, besides, certain individual peculiarities which belong to the mental content adjudged to be real, dis- tinguishing it from mere fancies, which we may call the indirect conditions. These are : (i) feelings connected with the reproduction of events, such as fear and anxiety; (2) memories of real events, much richer in detail than those merely imagined; (3) the fact that, in the reproduction of the perceived content, the associated elements are bound together with greater fixity, certainty, and necessity than in the mere imagination complexes. These characteristics are not intrinsic to the process of adjudging a content to be real, though they are very favorable to it. The judgment of unreality rests in part upon the comparison of ideational with perceptual mental con- tents. In such a judgment, we have the three following moments: the ideational reproduction of parts not perceived; association of the two kinds of mental content; and comparison, that is, the becoming aware of the dif- ference in reality-coloring of the ideational and perceptual content. This holds true of simultaneous as well as of successive associations. A. U. POPE. Valeur de la raisin hIuzmaine. CLODIUS PIAT. Rev. Neo-Sc., XIV, I, PP. 5-i8. The value of human reason is often called in question on account of the subjective conditions which limit knowledge. But this view, pushed to its logical outcome, denies the existence of all other men; and even Kant and Mill shrank from such solipsism. Moreover, it is only through reason and the testimony of other men that we know the past; and science never limits itself to the present appearance, but always presses forward to the true reality. The psychological origin of knowledge does not deter- mine questions of validity ; we know things as they are, even though we do not know them ' in themselves.' Their necessary relations give rise to analytic judgments, in which, whether tautological or heterological, the necessary connection of the two terms is seen to follow from the nature of the terms themselves, and is no mere addition of thought from without. This is true even of the much attacked principle of causality, as may be shown by carrying out Kant's own principles to their logical conclusion; in becoming idealistic, the principle of efficiency loses none of its objective necessity. There are no synthetic propositions in the Kantian sense; all</page><page sequence="3">562 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. our necessary judgments are analytic, based 'on a study of the evidence itself. Our necessary judgments are strictly universal; the principles of our reason govern the whole realm of the possible. Experience shows that our ideas are derived from the facts, and correspond to the facts; they have empirical and also metempirical validity. F. D. MITCHELL. A Criticism of the Psychologists' Treafment of Knowledge. H. A. PRICH- ARD. Mind, No. 6i, pp. 27-53. This article deals primarily with Ward's article on Psychology in the En- cyclofaf5dia Britannica, but makes occasional references to Stout's Analytic Psychology and Manual of Psychology. As the writer himself says, the argument is: (I) That the psychologists' attitude to knowledge is based on a false theory of knowledge; (2) that they ignore the subject-object relation involved in knowledge; and (3) that the desire for explanation that prompts their treatment is mistaken. In accepting the Lockean and Berkeleyan standpoint as the true one for the science of psychology, Ward commits himself to a position that renders knowledge impossible. For Locke con- ceives the idea as separate from the reality of which it is a kind of picture, while Berkeley's position, which Ward does not distinguish from that of Locke, logically leads to subjective idealism; and neither of these views gives to knowledge objective validity. And as far as subjective idealism is concerned, it cannot stand before the absolute postulate of knowledge, which postulate the author frankly assumes, -that what is known exists independently of the knowledge of it. This, in fact, is the crux fatal to all idealism. The influence of these two standpoints is evident in the writings of psychologists. Ward's distinction between psychology and the physical sciences is based on the Berkeleyan point of view, and logically abolishes physics altogether. If it be objected that this distinction is based not upon subjective idealism, but upon modern idealism, still the realistic objection involved in the above postulate must be met. This fundamental fallacy of treating psychology as the study of the ' world as presented' vitiates the whole procedure of the psychologists of this school. The influence of the Lockean point of view is seen in Ward's theory of presentation, where that which is presented is practically Locke's ' idea' and not the reality itself. Perhaps this same influence is more evident in the writings of Stout, who accepts the Lockean standpoint explicitly. And among psychologists generally the same tendency is evident, especially in their theory of per- ception, which seems to say that the physical world is never a direct object of perception, but is known only through sensations. In fact, that of which we are conscious in thought is not ideas but real universals; we perceive objects, not percepts of objects. Knowledge consists of a subject-object relation. On the subject side of this relation is the knowing or appre- hending subject; everything else that is real falls on the object side. Know- ing, therefore, is always the relation in which subject stands to object.</page><page sequence="4">No. 5.] SUMM14ARIES OF ARTICLES. 563 Therefore knowing cannot possibly be an object, as psychologists attempt to make it, when they treat the apprehension of an object as if it were itself an object. To demand an explanation of mental processes is to ask for an impossibility. Reflection can make us aware of the perception of an object, the act of discrimination, and the mind's power of apprehending univer- sals; but it cannot explain these activities. Explanation is, indeed, a mistaken ideal of knowledge ; many processes (e. g., the operation of counting) are intelligible but inexplicable. The true ideal of knowledge is to understand, not to explain. After all, the faculty psychology of Plato and Aristotle is the best. G. W. CUNNINGHAM. Image, Idea, and Meaning. R. F. ALFRED HOERNLE. Mind, No. 6I, PP. 70-100. A common theory distinguishes in every idea three aspects: existence, content (image), and meaning, -the first two psychological, the last log- ical. The meaning consists of part of the content of the image, set apart and fixed by the mind. But this view is untenable. The meaning is uni- versal, not particular; it is richer than the image, not poorer. The theory in question is based solely on a consideration of ' revivals' of visual and other sense-perceptions; but many persons make little use of such imagery. No idea is wholly meaningless; every idea is, even psychologically, an idea of something. Idea and meaning form together an inseparable com- plex psychic whole, in which, however, only the meaning is normally per- ceived. The complex of sign (word) and meaning is not formed by mere association, and there need not be any identity of content between them. The older psychologists,- Hobbes, Hume, Dugald Stewart, and others,- fixed their attention solely on the image, and tried to convince themselves that it was the whole; the same fallacy is found in James's theories of emotion and activity. Every idea is at once my idea and my idea of something; for both psychology and logic consciousness always has a meaning, an object outside itself, which cannot be reduced to a mere psychic ' fringe ' of other images or signs. The 'fringe' is subordinate to the meaning, even when the meaning is only implicit. In experi- ence we are always conscious of reality; neither psychology nor logic can go back of this unity of sign and meaning. The distinction between sign and meaning is not coincident with the common distinction between idea and reality. The ' real' and the ' imaginary' are made of the same stuff, and the difference between them has no basis in the character of ideas as mental events. The ideal is often taken as ipiso facto unreal; this may mean, among other things, (a) that the real is the present and the ideal the not-present, or (b) that the real is what is given in sense-perception. (a) When we say that the past and the future are present 'in idea' but not ' in reality,' we may use the word ' present' either in a temporal sense,- the idea of the past or future is I present' in the subjective time series of my consciousness now, though its object is not 'present' in the objective</page><page sequence="5">564 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. time series,- or in a non-temporal sense, referring to the qualitative dif- ference between the original experience, in which reality must cooperate, and the later revival of that same experience, to which the cooperation of the object is, on the theoretical side, not essential. This difference be- tween the original experience and the retained or remembered experience is in the main irrelevant for logic, but not for psychology. An object once experienced as real retains this character of reality even though known thereafter only through memory. (b) The identification of reality with sense-perception, as contrasted with the ideal element in thought, shows that the distinction depends on the subject's mode of experiencing the ob- ject, not on the content of the object which cooperates in the original ex- perience. Disputes about the relation of sense-perception to thought are largely due to a confusion of these two meanings of ' idea.' In conclusion, the author indicates briefly the application of his theory to the realization of ideas in volition. F. D. MITCHELL. Prolegomena to an Afiology for Pragmaticism. C. S. S. PEIRCE. The Monist, XVI, 4, pp. 492-546. This article, as its title indicates, is meant to be propoedeutic to a fur- ther discussion of the pragmatic theory of knowledge. It is an attempt on the part of the author to present in diagrammatic form the general course of thought. Such diagrams, he argues, will enable one to investigate the essential relations involved in a process of thought, just as the chemist, for example, investigates the molecular structure of a particular substance. Since the logician is concerned not so much with results as with the na- ture of the process by which they are arrived at, the diagram, to be of service to the logician, should picture distinctly the smallest step of the process so that its significance in relation to the whole may be adequately represented. Such a scheme of diagrammatization the author believes he has discovered in his system of existential graphs. He goes into a some- what detailed discussion of this system of existential graphs, but, on ac- count of its very technical nature, it hardly lends itself to a summary. In general, he attempts to show by analysis how this scheme of diagramma- tization is suited to an adequate and thorough representation of any proposition or course of argument. By means of this scheme, also, he hopes to bring to light important truths of logic, hitherto little understood, and closely connected with the truth of Pragmaticism. Then follow cer- tain rules by which the method of the formation and interpretation of the existential graph is to be determined. There are five such rules, or ' conventions' as the author chooses to term them. A few examples are then given to illustrate this diagrammatic reasoning, which to the author is the only really fertile reasoning. The reader is first carried through the evolution of the graph, is shown how it pictures to the eye the essential nature of the reasoning process, and finally is assisted through various steps</page><page sequence="6">No. 5-] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 565 of interpretation. In a later paper the author purposes to show in what relation the conception of the proposition and argument, reached as a re- sult of this system, stands to the truth of Pragmaticism. G. W. CUNNINGHAM. Though and Language. J. MARK BALDWIN. Psych. Rev., XIV, 3, pp. I8I-204. This article, which is taken from the material of Chap. vi of the author's work, Thoughf and Things, or Genetic Logic, Vol. II, "1 Experi- mental Logic," is an attempt to study the normal development of logical meanings. Viewing the problem from the standpoint of language, one notes two distinct and opposing tendencies in the various theories. (I) The personal or dynamic tendency, which considers language genetically as the vehicle of expression for thought, and looks at the problem from the personal or individual point of view. But how does language get its com- mon meaning ? This question leads naturally to (2) the social or static theory, which views the problem from the social side, and maintains that language is first common and conventional. Its problem is how such a stereotyped system of forms can become the vehicle of personal experience. The truth lies between these two extremes. Personal meanings and social meanings overlap, but do not coincide. The symbolism of common in- tercourse must therefore be both flexible, so that it can accommodate itself to personal experience, and static, so that it may embody the habitual and symbolized meanings of common experience. So the demand of develop- ing thought is for a social form of expression, embodying the dual refer- ence (I synnomic ' character) of logical meanings. Language grows to meet this demand, and is thus at once personal and social from start to finish; it is the material evidence of the concurrence of social and personal judgment. Written language embodies the static, speech the dynamic aspect of thought. Thought thus having a dual reference in its develop- ment, there must be two tests of truth. On the one hand, the individual must have a means of testing the validity of proposed meanings; on the other hand, there must be a means, social in its nature, by which the hy- potheses of individuals may be tried. The unit for such comparison of meanings is the unit of linguistic expression or a predicative meaning. Now analysis shows four possible cases of predicative meaning: a state- ment of belief (elucidation) by the speaker may be met with acceptance (elucidation) or a question (proposal) on the part of the hearer; and a statement of question (proposal) by the speaker may be met with belief (elucidation) or a joint question (proposal) on the part of the hearer. From the social point of view, we see that thought, and so truth, is instrumental in a very important sense. The development of truth is dialectic; the two tests in its development from proposal to elucidation are commonness and reasonableness. That is, this dialectic consists in the twofold movement from personal proposal through social judgment to personal judgment, and</page><page sequence="7">566 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. from social proposal through personal judgment to social judgment. So knowledge is never complete and never free from that problematic refer- ence which one or the other of these tests would further fulfil. The eluci- dations of one generation are proposals for the next, and the elucidations of society are proposals for the man of genius. Language is thus a per- sonal and social vehicle of thought, and its gradual development arises from the necessity of reciprocal intercourse between the individual and society. G. W. CUNNINGHAM. Comment seose lerobZl'me de Dieu. E. LE Roy. Rev. de Met., XV, 2, Pp. I29-I70. This article consists of a critique of the classical proofs for God's exist- ence. Although the argument is negative and destructive, the author in- timates that a following article will be positive and constructive. The classical proofs are divided into three classes: (I) those drawn from the physical world; (2) those drawn from the moral world; and (3) those drawn from pure reason. The first proof is from movement, by which God's existence is shown through the necessity of a prime mover. This proof implies the adoption of the postulate of motion as externally added to some part of a static, atomic world. The notion of a prime mover is so difficult to conceive that, as a proof, it is only explaining one mystery by one more obscure. The modern form of the cosmological proof is even more unsatisfactory and crude. In the form of the argument from contin- gence, it reveals God as transcending nature. The acknowledgment of a necessarium in rebus does not imply an aliquid, a necessary being. With- out begging the question, this argument proves only an immanent necessity and not a distinct, necessary being. The proof from a first cause is in- volved in an infinite regress. Even when God is not a term in the numeri- cal causal series, the argument uses the principle of causality, which be- longs to the phenomenal order, in the transcendent order. The argument from design is the most popular proof. It is a proof for the orator or lyric poet, and not for the logician; it is incomplete and insufficient, and suc- ceeds in proving only the intelligence and wisdom of an extra-mundane creator without establishing his perfection. The argument is weakened by science and rests on a general anthropomorphic basis. The argument from degrees ofperfection is open to a reductio ad absurdum; when used in the order of spiritual realities, it is vague and obscure, and includes a fietitio trinczii. In the case of the proofs from the moral world, let it be granted that all men have always believed in God. The whole problem consists in interpreting this belief. Although universal consent proves that our inmost aspirations are not individual subjective feelings, a desire is not a proof, but may be, through fear of illusion, a motive for doubt. The moral proof assures us of the existence of something, but perhaps it is not God. The moral world, like the intellectual world, is perpetually under-</page><page sequence="8">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 567 going organization. The moral proof leads to the recognition of the char- acter of God as a static, rigid absolute. To argue from the moral law to a divine legislator is to accept an anthropomorphic conception of God. The weak point of the moral proof, in any form, is that it rests on premises un- justifiable a firiori. The difference between the proofs from pure reason, or the ontological argument, lies in the form only. The common charac- teristic of these proofs is presenting God as an internal fundamental prin- ciple constitutive of thought. The ontological argument is the basis of all the others, and corresponds closely to the conclusions of idealistic criticism. Anselm's argument takes the form of a dilemma: either God exists or the concept of a perfect being is contradictory. We may accept the latter alternative. Infinity and perfection are not reconcilable with the idea of any sort of individual being. The proof from eternal and necessary truths implies an anthropomorphic conception and contains a tetitio f5rinci ii. In the Cartesian proof from the idea of the infinite, the notion of the in- finite is left too vague. We do possess the idea of the infinite, and it is immanent in every other idea. FRANK B. CRANDALL. Pragmatism as the Salvation fromn Philosothic Doubt. JOHN E. RUSSELL. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., IV, 3, pp. 57-64. The author frankly expresses doubt concerning the certainty of truth respecting any matters of fact that lie beyond the circle of the immediately known facts of experience, the passing moments. He holds that every theory of knowledge, idealistic as well as realistic, except pragmatism, logically issues in philosophic doubt. Pragmatism is now to have a hear- ing. Its conception of truth is substantially this: Truth is found only in experience and in that which is immediately given. This experience is constantly changing; want is followed by fulfilment, tension by relief, purpose by its achievement. Truth is such a working out; the true experi- ence is the one which has such an issue. So with knowledge; whenever, in a given experience, there is an awareness or consciousness of the ex- perience, of its want, its discord, its intention, its pointing beyond itself, there is knowledge. Truth is known because it is experienced. To this the author replies that, though the statement of the kind of change neces- sary for conversion from doubt by pragmatism is clear, it is not so clear how that conversion can be effected. Pragmatism is unable to make one a pragmatist, because its conception of truth is one which makes it impos- sible to produce a reasoned conviction that its doctrine is true. Again, there seems no place in this world of true experience for any but one's own experience. Or, if many reals are postulated, how can they have anything to do with each other ? If they are supposed to do so, how can they, un- less, as realities, they be conceived in a certain way; unless certain con- sequences be deduced from this conception, and the conception be verified</page><page sequence="9">568 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. by actual experiences which agree with the deduced, the hypothetical, ex- periences ? But this is adopting the conception of truth as the agreement of an idea with its object. Finally, if the true experience is not a mere chance transformation, must there not be some idea of the total experience as having a determinate character; such a character as should emerge from the given situation ? And is not the judgment of truth dependent upon the comparison of this experience and the purposed one ? If these are necessary parts of truth and cognitive experience, is there not a differ- ent conception of truth used from that first given as pragmatic ? The author finds himself, at the end, as at the beginning of his inquiry, con- fessing doubt; for between the pragmatist's region where doubt entereth not and himself, there still seems to be a great gulf fixed. MATTIE ALEXANDER MARTIN. PSYCHOLOGY. The Province of Functional Psychology. J. R. ANGELL. Psych. Rev., XVI, 2, pp. 6I-9I. In delineating the scope of functionalist principles, we distinguish three principal forms of the functional problem. In the first place, as against the structural psychologist, the functionalist holds that, however it may be in other sciences dealing with life, in psychology at least the answer to the question ' what' implicates the answer to the questions ' how' and ' why.' If, in inquiring regarding any particular sensation, you abstract from the manner in which, and the reasons why, it was experienced, your analysis and description are manifestly partial and incomplete. Secondly, the functionalist's problem is to discover the fundamental utilities of conscious- ness; and here, as mind contributes in general to organic adjustment to environment, we see the broad, biological ideal. Two general types of functional categories are disclosed,- the physiological, e. g., assimilation, and those concerned with the more general trend of organic development, e. g., selection. Various other classifications have been advanced, e. g., that of Warren into sensibility, modification, differentiation, association, and discrimination. The third conception of functional psychology shows its relation to psychophysics, and takes for consideration those expressive movements which follow upon certain ideational activities which we inter- pret as anticipatory and deliberative. Its meaning is that, at certain stages of psychological development, it has become necessary to resort to phy- siological considerations. What particular theory (interaction or parallelism or other) is to be adopted, is still a question for the individual thinker, and in his decision he is probably largely influenced by current philosophical discussion. The various theories of the'functional problem converge upon one another. Its most fundamental category is perhaps control, of the process of which the special forms of consciousness are simply particular phases. Of course, the mechanism of control is dependent upon the cog-</page><page sequence="10">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 569 nitive processes, etc.; but, from the vitalistic point of view, control is still the basic factor. Whatever the influence of biology, philosophy will always stand high in the favor of functional psychology as an interpreter of its achievements and an integral part of the scheme of the cosmos. Function- alism means to-day a broad, flexible, and organic point of view in psychology. MARGARET K. STRONG. Lafonction fisychologique du rire. L. DUGOS. Rev. Ph., XXXI, I2, pp. 576-599. To attempt to explain laughter by referring it to profound, subtle, and mysterious causes is to make a true explanation impossible. Laughter is, and can be, psychologically, only an elementary and simple phenomenon. Physically, laughter is a breaking forth into irregular respiratory action pro- duced by an accidental cause, and has two conditions: a prior nervous tension, and an external circumstance which suddenly ends this tension. Laughter, considered as an ideo-emotional phenomenon, has likewise two conditions: a prior state of seriousness manifested in muscular tension and checked respiration, and a sudden emotion producing a reaction against the previous state, a muscular relaxation and active respiration. Laughter being the transition from the serious to the comical, implies the ability to experience both. Seriousness is the starting-point in an explanation of laughter. The sage, who is purely a reasoning being, and the animal, which has no reason, do not laugh. Seriousness is an intermediate stage between animal stupidity and reason. Contradiction is not a cause of laughter, but an indication of the laughable. What is laughable in itself is, and can be, only misplaced and abnormal seriousness. The person who laughs enters by sympathy into the state of mind of the person at whom he laughs and partly shares his folly. Hence he who laughs must have in him a little of the fool, and must let himself yield somewhat to the first impressions of things. Of the conditions of laughter, objective and subjective, the former are the more important. The unforeseen may be regarded as a characteristic cause of laughter, when the terms are made precise. If laughter has always an external necessary cause, the intimate and profound cause must lie in the temperament. Laughter is essentially subjective and individual, and is an effect of one's disposition. Laughter marks the giv- ing up of one belief and the adoption of another, the giving to the ideas one course and suddenly diverting it. The cause of laughter is a disillusion. There are as many sorts of laughter as there are ways of the mind' s instinc- tive adoption and rejection of belief. Laughter of the ' dogmatic ' and ' skeptical' types lacks both simplicity and gaiety. A man is characterized both by the nature of his beliefs and by the way in which they spring up and are removed in his mind. Laughter is a phenomenon of adaptation of the mind to images which obtrude, and marks the sudden transition from one state of the mind to another, different or contrary. Laughter plays an im- portant role in practical life in facilitating intercourse between different types</page><page sequence="11">570 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. of men. The psychic impulsive nature of laughter is the element em- phasized. FRANK B. CRANDALL. La fsychoiogie quantitative. J. J. VAN BIERVLIET. Rev. Ph., XXXII, I, PP. 1-33; 2, Pp. 140-I75. The history of scientific psychology is marked by three periods: that of psychophysics, that of psychophysiology, and that of experimental psy- chology. Fechner, the founder of the first, attempted a general application of Weber's Law, i. e. : within limits, the smallest perceptible difference between two excitations of the same nature is always due to a real differ- ence which increases proportionally to the excitations themselves. Ac- cording to Fechner's application of this law, it is the special property of the soul, as affected by certain forces, to reduce the intensity of impres- sions to their logarithm; or, sensations increase as the logarithm of their stimuli. Nerve currents, externally excited, are converted in the cortex into cerebral images of conscious sensations, and the intensities of these sen- sations are compared in consciousness. Fechner imagines an intermediate element between excitation and sensation, the psychophysical movement produced by vibratory excitation in the nerve. Confounding pure sen- sation, the terminus of the nerve current, with the complex sensation we get in consciousness, he thought sensation could be measured as a quantity. Fechner was hampered as a scientist by a metaphysical preoccupation. He sought the relations of abstract sensibility disembarrassed of concrete conditions, which conditions he considered of secondary importance. Weber' s work, upon which Fechner draws, is careless, and Weber' s figures turn against him. Nor were Fechner's own experiments conducted with sufficient precision, or checked by null or negative stimulations. Nor yet was any measure of attention taken. And he employed an absurdly small number of observers, a dozen perhaps; sometimes himself alone, or three or four of his collaborators. Even then his results contradict Weber' s Law. His best work was a criticism of methods. He perfected and employed three: 'just perceptible differences,' using ascending and descending series; ' true and false judgments,' comparing the intensities of two impressions in a great number of trials ; and ' average errors,' comparing the individual with the average error of a great number of cases. In working on the sensation limen, he sought the least possible perceived sensations, and the smallest perceptible difference between two or more sensations. Fechner's work was ably criticised and refuted by Hering, and corrected and modi- fied by Delboeuf and many others. Helmholtz and Plateau measured luminous sensations. Delboeuf introduced the law of fatigue and ex- haustion, based on the observation that nerves accommodate themselves to stimuli, so that for the same degree of excitation progressively stronger stimuli are required. Wundt, the founder of physiological psychology, held that a stimulus of intensity corresponding to the external stimulus is produced in consciousness, and that consciousness compares this sensation</page><page sequence="12">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 57 I with other conscious sensations, the reduction of intensity taking place in consciousness. Merkel bases his experiments on Wundt's application of Weber's Law. Stumpf distinguishes the subjective certitude of our judg- ments from their objective certitude. This last certitude can be measured. MUnsterberg sees all sensation end in a muscular sensation. A visual sensation is not the multiple of another visual sensation and cannot be measured in units of itself. But every sensation modifies muscular tonicity, and the consequent muscular sensations are quantitatively and consciously comparable. The fundamental error of psychophysics lay in regarding sensation as simple. A sensation, on entering consciousness, becomes a part of a complex of sensations and emotions. It is not possible by the determination of the external excitation and the resulting nerve current to measure the sensation, for the sensation is not at all what consciousness attributes to the nerve commotion caused from without. Fechner, seeking a law by which mind is related to matter, thought he saw that the move- ments of the exterior world impinging on the soul undergo a certain re- duction. Psychophysics tried to determine the quantity of that reduction for the several senses. The tendency of that period was to reach math- ematical formulae. Applying the methods of physics to human activity was treating men as the reproductions of an archetype constructed after an exact formula. To this concept is due the insufficiency of subjects of ex- periments. They indeed tried to render the material conditions of experi- mentation as equal as possible, but they neglected another factor of the experimental condition, the subjective disposition of the observer. Fech- ner, however, created a movement, called attention to questions of capital importance, and perfected valuable methods of psychological investigation. C. WEST. De 1 esprit magique a 1 esfrit scientifqiue. SAGERET. Rev. Ph., XXXII, 3, pp. 289-305; 4, PP. 366-383. A spirit resembling that of modern savagery, and quite the opposite of that of science, dominated early civilizations. This savage mentality has never ceased to exist, and survives now in religions, customs, laws, and superstitions of civilized peoples. Two principles of savage magic can be formulated: (i) The part is equivalent to the whole; (2) like influences or presages like. Under these principles we can class certain marks of savage mentality, such as a belief in essences, in tabooed objects, in the virtue of touch, in invisible beings similar to visible beings, in animism and all forms of confusion of man and nature, in metamorphoses and incarnations. We find survivals of these in our day in charms and the curative power of sacred relics, in sacraments and the laying on of hands in religious rites, in the belief in ghosts and astral bodies, in sacrifices and the significance of repeated names and numbers and of signs and symbols. Most of these traits are seen again as the very essence of poetry and art, as well as of mysticism and religion. But what gives a characteristic mental tone to our</page><page sequence="13">572 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEWU modern civilization is the spirit of science, which is opposed to the spirit of magic as the objective is to the subjective. Science has progressed by the gradual dehumanization of the world. The spirit of science demands dis- interestedness, and the logic of feeling is not disinterested. Therefore sci- ence must be free from human feeling. Mathematics, apparently operations of the human spirit governing the external world, would seem to root the human and the subjective the more deeply. But their danger is not in them- selves; they are but indifferent instruments, incapable of modifying the na- ture of what they combine, and, indeed, in so far as they refract by essence the logic of feeling, they are necessary to science, though not sufficient. Again, astronomy could not become a science while it served human ends, as astrology. Nor can industry, whose every step of progress has come by the aid of disinterested scientific investigation, become a science while in human service. And when it comes to a study of man, the only guarantee of its value as a science must be the abstraction from it of feeling. C. WEST. Sur 1 imagination affective. F. PILLON. Rev. Ph., XXXII, 3, pp. 225-25 5. There are as many kinds of imagination as there are kinds of memory. The rOle of imagination is to vary the modes of association of remembered images of all kinds. Now there is an affective memory as there is a visual memory. The affective memory guides desire. Feelings and the move- ments that express them are so far associated that not only does the feeling cause an external expression, but the expression in turn arouses the feel- ing. Reproductions of these feelings, more or less lively, tend also to repro- duce attitudes, gestures, and other movements. These reproduced move- ments tend, in their turn, to revive those reproduced feelings which gave them birth. There is thus established between feelings or affective repro- ductions and sensations or motor images an inseparable association, which results in mutual dependence. There is, then, no disembodied human emotion, but neither can an intellectual life be conceived which is not in some degree affective. Hence a disembodied intellectual life, if not human, must yet be affective. A collective emotion may likewise be explained as one which spreads by suggestion and imitation of movements and feelings. But the movements and feelings, though associated, are distinct phenomena. C. WEST.</page></plain_text>
