<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science Without Conscience JEAN MAYER without conscience, said Rabelais, "is but ruination of the soul/' This sentence appears in a letter of Gargantua to his son Pantagruel - after Gargantua has commanded Pantagruel to master as many secrets of natural science as were taught in his time. This precept is as timely today as it was then. In this century, we have seen the unleashing of chemical warfare by the Germans in World War I, the human "experiments" conducted by the Nazis in World War II, the welcome given by both the West and the Russians to the technological mercenaries whose skills had devised the V-is and V-2S, the stockpiling of horrors for biological warfare, crop destruction in Vietnam. At least some scientists spoke up about these abominations as they occurred. In an age in which the volume of voices - including those of scientists - has been raised by at least one order of magnitude, little thought seems to have been given to the conditions under which a scientist can or must speak while remaining a scientist as compared to those occasions in which he speaks as a citizen (who may have acquired distinction or fame as a result of his scientific work). First, let us agree that greater knowledge brings greater re- sponsibility. Whenever the knowledge of a scientist is of direct relevance to the solution of an important social problem that is not being adequately handled, we may agree that it is legitimate for the scientist to speak up. The Periclean dictum, "In Athens, we think that silent men are useless," still applies in a twentieth- century democracy based on science and technology. There are many areas such as hunger and malnutrition in America, pollution, the maldistribution of health facilities, where the information was O JEAN MAYER is professor of nutrition, lecturer on the history of public health, and member of the Center for Population Studies at Harvard University. 265</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR available to professionals a long time before they (or others) spoke up. The prolonged silence of scientists has often led to accusations of ' 'moral neutrality" and, I believe, is directly responsible for the turning away from science by so many gifted young people, which is a tragedy, for, while science alone will not solve the problems of society, these will not be solved without science. One general area on which scientists ought to speak up is that of measurement and evaluation of programs. In every area of public activity - health, food, education, defense - we are main- taining or launching enormous programs without any built-in evaluation method that would enable us to determine whether the programs are working at all, whether they show a rapidly diminishing return as more money is expended, or whether an alternative is not more profitable. Such a watchdog role can only be filled by intervention of specialists (to choose and define the yardstick) and by the general support of scientists (who, unlike politicians and the general public, are or should be perpetually open to the idea that the best and often the only way to study a phenomenon is through a series of measurements). Second, let us agree that scientists ought not to speak as scien- tists in areas that bear no relevance to their scientific qualifications. They can, obviously, express their views as citizens, but they should be careful not to let an irrelevant scientific prestige obscure the debate. Although this writer happened to sympathize with many of the opponents of the A.B.M., the S.S.T. and the Amchitka explosion, it was extremely irritating for him as a concerned citizen to be unable to distinguish in the mass of statements by non- competent scientists, the voices of those who could, with authority, discuss the pertinent issues. Third, let us all be careful not to let our enthusiasm for im- portant causes carry us beyond the limits of our competence; let us at least clearly signal when we cross the border and henceforth speak as laymen. Recent debates on agriculture and the environ- ment are cases in point. They often assume the character of dia- logues of the deaf where each side pursues its id√©e fixe without any recognition of the validity of other viewpoints. We obviously can- 266</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE WITHOUT CONSCIENCE not feed the world without fertilizers and other agricultural chemi- cals. The use of pesticides has been of inestimable value in mos- quito control inside human habitations and in judicious applica- tions outside; on the other hand, the application of chemicals to the environment has its ecological cost; when the application is massive, as in cotton-growing areas, the cost can be high, and secondary D.D.T. resistance has complicated problems of malaria control. We must guard against exaggerations even when committed for a good cause. Because our Western culture has never come to terms with nature, it is often expedient to exaggerate the perils to man of ecologically dangerous agents. In the Scriptures, the only sympathetic reference to animals of no economic value to man was in the story of Noah's ark and the Covenant. The Neoplatonic inspiration of the Church Fathers, the Manichean influence of Augustine, the Thomist "Natural Law" unrelated to nature, the anthropomorphism of the Reformation, of the American, French and Russian revolutions all influenced us to believe that ethics is concerned only with relations between man and man, man and society or man and a personal God. The isolated voices of Francis of Assisi and of Schweitzer had no social impact. We were unwill- ing or unable to learn from a Hinduism committed to metempsy- chosis, from African cultures committed to animism or from our own native Indian philosophy of oneness with nature and account- ability of animal life. Our "conservation movement" was sponsored by a president who spent his leisure shooting animals all over the world. In the absence of a general acceptance that animal and plant species have a right to existence because, like us, they are here, and thus that nature should be defended for nature's sake, ecologists appear to be constantly tempted to exaggerate the toxicological dangers to man of any factor that modifies the environment through its toxicity for other species; the result is a steady erosion of the credibility of science. Finally, the academic scientific community must come to terms with the existence, in industry, of a great many scientists who have not abjured their ethics either as scientists or as citizens because they have left universities. Most practical problems will not be 267</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR solved without their active cooperation. For example, in the field of environmental protection, industrial scientists are often the only ones who have the analytical methods that can permit the study of the dispersion of chemical agents in the environment or who know the distribution of suspected additives in foods. The practical problem is to encourage them to publish and to speak up accord- ing to their consciences by giving them the encouragement and support that physicians find in their medical associations and teachers in their unions or in the American Association of Uni- versity Professors. Such a set of practices would work out to the long-term advantage of industry by answering in advance (as needs to be done now for food additives and drugs) many of the ques- tions necessary for the clearance of new compounds and by de- creasing the likelihood of ruinous negligence and environmental lawsuits. Such a new practical ethics would surely be preferable, from the viewpoint of the national community, to the alternative: the encouragement of secret communications to consumer ad- vocates by industry scientists afraid to speak up openly. The mo- ment seems opportune to have a national organization, like the American Association for the Advancement of Science, form a committee to examine the role of the industrial scientist in regu- latory processes and environmental protection. If we, as scientists, want to restore John Winthrop's vision of America as "a City upon the Hill," we must learn to exercise our consciences as citizens without losing our ethical values as scientists. 268</page></plain_text>
