<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphic Crucifixes in Sinai I A I SIR,-Four kilometres below the bridge of Abu * LI. * Aweiqila, which carries the main road from Egypt to Palestine, the Wadi el-'Arish, the 'river of Egypt,' a dry watercourse plentifully fringed with tamarisk bushes, encounters a sandstone bluff about 12 metres high and makes a sharp turn to the west. In the bed of the wadi three or four water holes have been dug which yield a copious supply of brackish water. On the summit of the bluff is perched a rectangular tomb of roughly dressed blocks with the trace of a room (or chapel ?) beside it. At a little distance, perhaps 150 metres downstream, on the right bank of the wadi, is a considerable cemetery of Moslem graves. The water holes, the cemetery, and the locality generally are known as Awlad 'Ali, that is 'the children of 'Ali.'- But as to who this 'Ali had been, the present inhabitants of the neighbourhood, Bedouins of the Tarabin tribe, could tell me nothing in November, 1945. Other Arabs indeed declared that he had been ' the ancestor of all the Tarabin and the Mileihat as w4l1,' but the Tarabin themselves repudiated the suggestion. Nor could they throw any light on the identity of the occupant of the anc4ient tomb on the bluff-presumably not a Moslem saint, for, in that case, the Moslem dead would have been buried as close up to him as possible. Yet, though his origin is wrapped in mystery, his influence with Allah is still great and his intervention with the Deity is considered well worth seeking. Consequently every April the tomb is the object of a ceremonial visit by the Tarabin and then it is that their women deposit by its north-eastern corner a number of cruciform images, so that now there is a pile of some 60 or 70 of these in every stage of decay beside it.. The Tarabin, however, maintain that these are not Christian crosses, but that the form is due to their wasm or tribal mark being cruciform. The figure given, that of one I stole, sufficiently shows the shape, but not the size, 75 cm. long, nor the colours, nor the care and ingenuity lavished in its construction. To make one, two sticks are first tied together in a cross and bound with wools of as many colours as are obtainable. In the one figured, white, dark green, orange, dark red, and cobalt blue have all been used in the wrappings, while the 'arms' consist of white linen rags. The head is a pink pad of cloth with two locks of human hair braided above it, while the head-dress is made up of a crescent of hens' feathers. Round the left 'arm ' is bound a wisp of animal hair, perhaps from a donkey's tail. Another image, not figured, had a sort of amulet hanging round its neck. The intention to make them as human as possible was clearly evident. But as to why the images were deposited there, the shy Tarabin would not vouchsafe any explanation. G. W.
