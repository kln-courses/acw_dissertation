<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHTETL IN NEW YORK: THE POET MALKA LEE1 Esther Jonas-Maertin * Abstract In the centre of this article is a female poet rooted in a long tradition of Yiddish literature. Since these roots are essential for understanding her work, I will give a short introduction to Yiddish language and literature, followed by a biographical sketch of the life of Malka Lee. The aim of the research and the biography is to consider the thematically selected poems2 and interpret them as the poetic reflections of a woman of the twentieth century. Introduction Language is memory, a mirror of a way of being, in its expression the self- portrait of the history of an experienced and suffering community. History lives in language, because it exactly preserves in words the feeling and experience that give significance to those who speak it. It is the indelibly branded ideals and values ofYiddish expressions, in a 'Jewish language',3 that preserve its voice in the course of embedding historical events in the cycle of the Jewish year, and thus it binds the generations to one another. The cultural continuities as well as the discernible discontinuities form a focus for this research, which examines the meaning of the respective conceptions of the Shtetl for its own identity. Another component of this work is the question of identity, more exactly of Jewish identity. The consciousness of the Jews is stamped by the images of their history, handed down, collectively experienced and transmitted as narrative. To every current event references to catastrophes like pogroms, the traces of survived experiences, could be produced. In the definition by Mira Zussman 'Jewish Identity' appears as a fourfold principle: 'In the feeling of common origin, in the attachment to faith, in the orientation towards a common land and in the identification with a particular history' . * Esther Jonas-Maertin, studied Jewish studies, religious studies and history in Potsdam and Leipzig.

Only through this combination of literary scholarship, together with the specific Jewish understanding of history and tradition, can the reader open up the poems. Furthermore, it must be assumed that Malka Lee, because of her religious upbringing, was familiar with the method of Jewish discourse in Talmud and Midrash through Zene ur'ene (a Yiddish collection of retold Biblical stories) and the T'chines (women's supplicatory prayers). This article attempts to work on the basis of this assumption. 'The valorization of midrash as interpretation and indeed as a model for interpretation means as well the revoicing of a Jewish discourse in the discourse of the West'. The investigation is not restricted to the literal meaning of the texts but rather includes the richness of tone, the relation to biblical texts as well as current connections. As a form of writing, 'midrashic poems' could offer information on how modern lyric poetry can investigate biblical texts and continue their meanings. 'The complexity of these texts will be integrated in time as the continuous quest for meaning that has no end.' The fact that Malka Lee undertook no change of language, 'after everything else has been shown to be irrelevant',9 lies in the indelible effect of this linguistic identity. The language in which the identity-bearing meaning is transmitted, is 'the subject, the very definition and understanding'.10 Yiddish is a language that carries in itself as much a particular history as the ability to renew that identity in an ongoing conscious process, whereby natural events blend together with the collective memory. The Biography11 Malka Leopold was born on 4 July 1904 in the Shtetl Monasterzyska (at that time the place in East Galicia belonged to Austria-Hungary, later Poland). She is one of the best-known female poets in Yiddish literature. Her parents, Frieda, nee Duhl, and Chaim Leopold, belonged to the Hasidic movement and consequently gave their daughter a religious upbringing. After elementary school, she attended the Gymnasium in Poland, and studied Hebrew and German. In her autobiographical text ' Durkh kindershe Oygn ' Malka Lee (her later pseudonym),14 described the difficult situation in her parents' house. The family had fled during the First World War through Hungary to Vienna where Malka Lee attended the Gymnasium. She could only address her father's conviction that the literary ambitions of his daughter were an 'irreligious act' by fleeing to the 'promised land', America. At the age of sixteen in early 1921, European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010 49</page><page sequence="3">The Shtetl in New York: The Poet Malka Lee she emigrated entirely alone to the United States, where she settled in New York. She earned a living at first as a seamstress in one of the sweatshops.16 Early on she encountered the workers movement and saw in this the possibility of changing society through her voice. 'Socialism offered Jewish women who were excluded from Judaism's tradition of learning an intellectual, as well as political outlet. It also gave them a voice for the first time'. Malka Lee wanted to be an activist, from her own experience, and probably also on the basis of her personal experience of the poor working conditions in the sweatshops. She studied, from 1921 to 1922 at the Jewish Teachers Seminary. In addition, until 1923, she attended courses for humanistic sciences at Hunter College18 and at City College in New York. On 10 June 1923 she married the writer Aaron Rappoport, who earned his living at that time as a machinist. Malka Lee no longer worked as a window dresser. According to the addresses of her correspondence,19 the family always lived in modest circumstances; her literary work was never able to give the poet a living wage. Soon after her arrival in New York she began, in 1923, to compose texts in Yiddish,20 in the medium which, in her Hasidic family, had been more than just the language for everyday use. In contrast to the Maskilim and the advocates of Hebrew as a 'holy language', Yiddish was seen as equally appropriate for religious needs.21 Given this importance, Hasidism relieved this language at the same time of its reputed blemish as the form of speech only of women and uneducated men, who for hundreds of years had turned to God through their Yiddish. The poet and journalist Kadye Molodovsky confirmed the unusual status of this choice of language: 'Many writers began to write at first in a foreign language, but only as Yiddish writers did they become what they are'.22 Regular correspondence23 and personal exchange with literary colleagues and critics belonged to the daily life of the couple.24 From the marriage two children were born, with whom, according to the archived correspondence, they kept in close contact. Their son Joseph was born in 1924 and, fifteen years later, in 1937, their daughter Yvette. Lee travelled, amongst other places, to Europe, Mexico and Israel. Her trip to Israel was a shared journey with the 'Pioneer Women Association' of America in 1960, of which she was a member, as she also was of the Yiddish PEN.25 Two years after the death of Aaron Rappoport (in August 1964), 26 Malka Lee married, Moshe Besser in 1966. Malka Lee died at the age of 72 in New York on 22 March 1976. The living spirituality of her family affected by the strong faith of its milieu is mirrored in her texts. The knowledge of this deep inner religious world, like her own clear, perceptive faculty, are typical of her entire work. Shmuel Niger characterized Malka Lee's poetry very forcefully: 'Malka Lee's lyric poetry is real, real are the threads which were spun, interwoven with the world around, 50 European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010</page><page sequence="4">Esther Jonas-Maerten with all of us. We believe her. Nature and natural powers, love, passion, motherhood, song, weeping - we turn in Malka Lee's songs to the old, to the eternal themes. We enjoy her never passing freshness'.27 Poetry Malka Lee published six collections of poems in total. In her first book, Lider , which was published in 1932 in New York, in eighty-nine poems she presented the following central themes above all: the new 'country' New York, her feeling of being homeless, the Shtetl (first), love and nature. In 1940, only eight years later, she presented the second book, Gezangen , a volume with altogether eighty-eight texts, particularly noteworthy for its love lyrics. Expressive, short lyric poems capture Lee's feelings since first meeting her husband Aaron Rappoport, alongside memories of the Shtetl. The rest include texts which describe motherhood, birth, nature and New York scenery, like the Subway or the gardens, as well as texts questioning human existence, the change of seasons, and the poet's characteristic zest for life. Kines fun undzer tsayt is the title of her third book, published in 1945. This collection contains ninety-two poems, which can be classified as Shoah literature. In them Malka Lee tries to make the Shoah comprehensible, to express her mourning for her people as well as her helplessness to find words in the face of such destruction. Five years later, in 1950, her fourth book, Durkh loytere kvaln , was published. This volume is laid out thematically in greater detail, and includes one hundred and eleven texts. The content moves from mourning for the lost Shtetl and arguments with individual murderers of her people,28 to nature, the People Israel, the creative process of poetic writing and positively hopeful poems for the 'morning'. Her readers held her last volume, Untern Nusnboym , in their hands for the first time in 1969. In the eighty-three poems included in this edition, a mature poet speaks, whose clear personality now appears so much stronger. The subjects it contains are: nature, the People Israel, family and poems with religious content and Lee also includes a thematic structuring and subdivisions. In their expression, these poems are the most accurate testimonial to her very own identity. An autobiographical work, Durkh kindershe Oygn ,29 together with ' Mayselekh far Yoselen' a storybook dedicated to her son Joseph,30 and the text for ' Am Israel Khay' 31 a musical piece, complete the spectrum of her work. With my choice of poems I want to show how Malka Lee brought the Shtetl , or to be more precise, her Shtetl , to her new native country, the United States of America. European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010 51</page><page sequence="5">The Shtetl in New York: The Poet Malka Lee Malka Lee's third volume of poetry shows how much historical events and occurrences can change the viewpoint and perception of meaning. Already the title of this book is programmatic. 'Laments of our time' seems to be a continuation of the first two books. While the first book, Lider , could be translated into German simply as 'Poems', or 'Songs', with her second book, entitled Gezangen , she moves more self-confidently and more pioneeringly to the melody of her language. The third book, 'Laments', indicates a development and at the same time more precision within the genre 'song'. The Book of Lamentations (Eichah) is the title of a Biblical book which, as part of the so-called 'Megillof (rolls), belongs to the liturgy of the Jewish year. Lamentations is part of the liturgy of Tisha b'Av, the fast day that commemorates the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem. Lamentations has a particular form and especially a solemn rhythm through which the 'eternally relevant words of Godly devotion'32 achieve their specific heartrending effect. The content is marked by laments on the destruction of Jerusalem, interrupted by single prayers, as well as expressions of the desire for retribution. Striking in Lamentations are the allegorical female images for the destruction, beginning with widows, then princesses, virgins, mothers, women, daughters, daughter of Zion, daughter of Jerusalem and daughter of my people,33 which function as representatives of the people as a whole: 'Woman here represents the common folk. Abandoned in the ruins of the city, we felt that God was far away from us all. The challenge for us, as women, who first symbolized the grief of mourning, to be the first to reconnect with God'34. The last characterization of women in Lamentations as a 'daughter of my people' matches the title of Malka Lee's first poem. However, the poet did not take on the strict form of Lamentations; the thirteen verses rhymed irregularly with every second verse. In the otherwise irregularly rhymed text the rhyme form in the last two verses is identical. The initially clear and insistent- sounding sentence of the title 'I am a daughter of my people' finds no correspondence in the verses that follow immediately. As in the contrast so in the intention of the title, the experience of the religious life and learning in 'small rooms' and 'the experienced threefold marginalisation as women members of a poor orthodox Jewish milieu',35 flow together with the religious feeling of belonging to 'Jacob's children'. The poetic 'I' places itself back in a 'small room' where 'scribes' sit, in surroundings which are familiar. However, immediately an apparent break is revealed: 'who has separated our paths?' The question becomes even more intensive in the fifth verse: 'who has ruptured the friendship amongst us?! ' An answer to this is not given; it remains an open question and even more an insoluble conflict. Just as each outstretching of hands remains one-sided, so every question is only ever answered with silence. A 'daughter' fights against 52 European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010</page><page sequence="6">Esther Jonas-Maerten the exclusion, wants to be not only heard but, above all, taken seriously as belonging. I am a daughter of my people A little room, long table, scribes sit across from one another, a narrow entrance - who has separated our paths? Lamps flicker - tubes of light like veins bursting, waiters bring bread and cake on full trays. No abyss - no mountain - and no fences, thus the scribes sit together in little rooms. Mirrors melting mirrors, two silver rivers, only a touch - hands help themselves and reach out ... I want to extend my hand through the narrow tables, who has ruptured the friendship between us? In the dazzling of the mirror I appear as if in blue phantoms, in the gleam of the mirror I see the grief on every face ... Opposite sits my teacher, his lips stiffly grim, his face shy, ripe with years and with knowledge ... I am related to him - my song has requested nothing, it has amputated from itself the world, the terrible bodily limbs. I have joined my song to their wounds - and bound my life closely to the needs of humanity ... I see on my teacher - his gray temples, from his face there pours such a quiet mourning ... And there sit the scribes, locks on their lips, my blue glance has created dumb silence ... And they look at me - as at a stranger - as if I was one of Laban's sheep between their fields. No, I am not the strange sheep amongst Jacob's cattle, I am a daughter of my people - a child of Jacob's children.36 The room with the lamps and the people sitting in it are described in an anthropomorphic way like a single organism, so that the light spreads out 'like veins' in the circulation of the blood. A world is created which is closed and bound together, which works without thinking like a body. 'Anthropological themes - authentic life, the quest for identity, boundary experiences - within the context of this biography are always also religious themes.'37 A notion in European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010 53</page><page sequence="7">The Shtetl in New York: The Poet Malka Lee Jewish mysticism contains the idea that letters, the basis of every language, are like the basis of an organism, helping to establish it, and that must connect it to the divine.38 All parts of the body have their function; none can exist without the other. But the 'daughter' no longer belongs; she has left this world and thus, so to speak, amputates herself. There is no way for reconciliation or a way back any more since this world and its people were destroyed, which is all the more painful for the speaker. The scribes just sit there, without moving, caught like a caricature in a dream. Reflections stimulate discourse amongst the different facets,39 'mirrors melt mirrors', the repeated splintering of the splintering without leaving behind a comprehensible final picture. No definite picture can emerge because no real conversation can take place again. A mirror offers merely one point of intersection in which the experience of reality and the unknown meet.40 The poet describes an extinct world in its apparent eternal harmony. The emigrant who left the Shtetl is established in a new life with different values to those of her past, but somewhere these memories of the former home remain present. Even when one is far away from the old traditions, the roots remain. In this case it is the homely Shtetl that one can visit, but a journey that only takes place in the imagination. As one formerly bound up in the world of the Shtetl , in its security, there remains now only the discussion with the memory and the attempt at creating one's own place. In the breaking of the mirror the poetic 'I' appears 'in blue phantoms', which, through their use of blue as a 'sign of distance'41 signal the 'striving for the eternal'.42 The 'blue' can also describe a certain artistic condition, express special strengths or creativity. It is also a synonym for longing, imagination, water and, more generally, as a symbol of life.43 However, the 'blue' probably indicates a new sign of the inner conflict of the author; a break has actually taken place with her own roots. The distance that has arisen is as painfully real as it is irreversible. Another conspicuous feature is the use of the Biblical story of Jacob and Laban. Jacob, who worked as a shepherd for Laban, wanted his payment after the birth of Joseph, so that he could leave with his wives Leah, Rachel, the children and his possessions. Jacob finally obtained the desired cattle and set off.44 In the Biblical story (Gen. 32:29ff) Jacob acquired the name 'Israel' after his fight with the angel, and became the progenitor45 of the twelve tribes of Israel. The line runs from Jacob to the current status of the poet, even up to the name of her son 'Joseph', based upon one of the twelve sons of Israel, mirroring her self-evident belonging to the Jewish people. In the last verse the topic is 'Jacob's cattle' but in the text of the Bible it always refers to sheep and goats.46 In this mistake one might recognize an inner distance47 from Jewish daily life developed over many years. Another 54 European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010</page><page sequence="8">Esther Jonas-Maerten possible interpretation would be to assume an intention of the poet. In this description the feeling of alienation is even emphasized, insofar as 'sheep' and 'cattle' are not part of a species or rather family, as little as the poetic 'I' (still) belongs. Nevertheless the desire is still there for the eternity of this existence located in the other world, even if this can only be lived in the imagination. The structure of 'My Tribe' is almost identical with the first poem in the second collection of poems published in 1940, called 'My Tribe Marches'. This poem also has five verses, each of which has four lines in the cross rhyme form. However, of significance is the difference in content and viewpoint which is coloured by Malka Lee's socialist ideals.48 (I will describe some of the main differences below.) In contrast, in the second poem of this research, 'I am a daughter of my people', the poet describes the religious surroundings of her childhood completely positively as a thoroughly pleasant world. The pious Jews, 'hasidim shining on festival days', are 'warm-hearted' and 'engaged'. These Jews preserve in their traditions the memory of the wonderful deeds of the Baal Shem Tov.49 A virtually idyllic picture arises from the descriptions50 in which the longing for harmony of the poetic 'I' is particularly evident. My Tribe I come from generations of Hasidim of shining Hasidim on festival days, of warm-hearted Jews who engage with the good deeds of the Baal Shem Tov. My grandfather chopped wood, for poor dwellings - gifts; my grandmother baked cholles for orphans and widows. My mother spent Shabbes eve running around in a white apron taking Shabbes cholle to humble doors and courts. And later - at home turned quietly into herself, blessing her Shabbes candles. In every corner are lights of childlike, joyful faces. I come from old tribes and hallow their pious traditions; aligning myself with my mother with generations of Jews with faith in God.51 European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010 55</page><page sequence="9">The Shtetl in New York: The Poet Malka Lee The 'grandfather chopped wood', which would be given away to the poor. Similarly, the 'grandmother who baked the cholles' the twisted bread for the Shabbat, is also engaged in charitable acts. A tradition which was obviously continued by the mother was the baking of the cholles , which were distributed to the needy. After all the poor have been supplied, silence enters. The Shabbat candles are now lit and blessed. One of the specifically female commandments is to light the candles, which traditionally marks the beginning of the Shabbat and with it the end of the working week. The light of the candles illumines every 'corner'. Beams lie on all 'faces'. The poet fits herself into the long ancestral line with its own traditions and well-loved customs. In the depiction of the religious connection lies the decisive difference to the first poem. Some motifs appear to have been taken on unchanged: 'tribe', 'tribes', 'generations' and 'faces', although the meaning in 'My Tribe' moves in a completely different context. The poetic 'I' in 'My Tribe Marches' locates itself in a formal continuity with many generations, which, however, are not named in a Jewish or explicit Hasidic context. There are no inner or personal structures. The common declaration is limited to the 'red flags' known as the symbol of the socialist movement. Even the faces remain anonymous. In addition, the 'sons' stand with no (concrete) interpersonal connection 'in the ranks'. It is a clearly masculine world in which the 'youth' and the 'sons' represent for the socialist ideology the ideal masculine fighters. Only the belonging to the Jewish people emerges from this text. The reason that the first poem belongs within a Jewish context, as far as the reader can recognize, lies most probably in the Yiddish language itself. Noteworthy in the listing of the different family tasks is the absence of the figure of the father, who, in accordance with religious ritual, should recite the Kiddush52 and, moreover, the blessing over children and family. This exclusion mirrored, in the imaginary world of the poetry, the actual situation. After her father destroyed her poems before the emigration to America her relationship with him was beyond repair. Malka Lee never again mentioned the father. Her only single connection to the old native country, to the Shtetl , is the mother. Even if the Shtetl no longer exists, it still forms a part of her identity. The poetic 'I' joins the matrilineal succession of Jewish generations. A reverent recognition of the 'pious traditions' revives the 'faith in God' as an old virtue. This strong emphasis on religiosity finds its continuation in the poem 'My Jews'.53 In three four-line verses the poetic 'I' strengthens her belonging. While the first and third verses show pairs of rhymes, the middle verse uses an outer rhyme which enfolds the two rhymed inner lines. The concern of the speaker is intensified by means of the direct address to 'My Jews'. 56 European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010</page><page sequence="10">Esther Jonas-Maerten My Jews My Jews, Jews, with yarmulkes and kittels, my shining Jews in broad-rimmed hats, wrapped in tallis, with siddurim in their hands, Jewish eyes turned to God. My Jews, Jews of another time. Above sits the Chazen on a chair. Menoros shine in the shul in your prayers - my grandfather's voice. Generations of prayers sing in my blood. My Jews, Jews, for me it is fine to be with you, My Jews, Jews, for me you are beloved and dear - I have burned with you in the fire of expulsion. 'My Jews, withyarmulkes and kittels ,/my shining Jews in broad-rimmed hats', thus the poet leads into the appearance of another world. At first sight it is the general description of the clothes of orthodox Jews. On further reading, particularly in the last line of the poem: 'I have burned with you in the fire of expulsion', it becomes clear that this represents the description of a world that no longer exists. The general belonging of the poetic 'I' to the 'Jews' is beyond question. Throughout the complete poem this strong emphasis on the possessive formulation 'my Jews' is striking. With prayer shawl, ' tallis' and the prayer books, ' Siddurim ', the 'Jews of another time' are turning to God. The poet draws a world of deep devoutness in which the people really 'shine' through piety. It is the world of Malka Lee's childhood in which she probably was allowed to accompany the grandfather to the synagogue, to be with the men as long as she was a child, and was with them during the rituals, listened to the prayers. The prayer leader, the ' Chazen' the synagogue, the ' shul' and the shining of the ' Menoros ' are branded in the memory as if by fire. The prayers, which continued almost unchanged for generations, live on in the poetic 'I'. Possibly the poet here is also referring to the symbolic meaning of the seven-branched candlestick: the Menorah as a symbol of divinity, for the harmony of creation, as it may be found again in the seven planets or also in the mystical image of the seven heavens.54 Malka Lee describes a harmonious world to which she longs to return, even though she was forced to leave this world because of the existing prejudices against women. In the final verse the characteristic emphasising of identity is again intensified. 'My Jews, Jews, for me it is fine to be with you/. . . for me you are beloved and dear -/I have burned with you in the fire of expulsion'. From Malka Lee's biography it is known that she had long been in New York at the time of the National Socialist persecution and destruction, and so found herself outside this European Judaism Volume 43 No. 1 Spring 2010 57</page><page sequence="11">The Shtetl in New York: The Poet Malka Lee sphere of influence, but quite independently of this, whether Yiddish poets were themselves touched by the Shoah, or could escape from it through flight, they were 'directly concerned'.55 'The Yiddish writers wrote not like outsiders - but as people who were personally engaged by the tragic events'.56 What remains for the poet are the memories of positive experiences, which in retrospect allow for a romantically transfigured world of harmony. The open questions from 'I am a daughter of my people' no longer exist here, nor the need to ask further questions. As far as could be demonstrated, Malka Lee carried the Shtetl with her as an imaginary place where she could be creatively active. With the living memory of the Shtetl , in this her own world, Malka Lee created poems whose characteristic feature is in the hope that lies within them.
