<plain_text><page sequence="1">Earth and Water: Early Traditions and Uses of Ancient Greek Clay Beryl Barr-Sharrar As Hesiod tells the story,' when Zeus, in retaliatory rage, determined to punish man- kind after the receipt of Prometheus's stolen gift of fire, he ordered Hephaestus to mold from earth and water the likeness of a virgin goddess. This, of course, was Pandora, ances- tress of all women, who before long would open the storage jar given her by the gods and let scatter out the evils, the heavy toil, and the painful bodily afflictions that men had been spared until then, securing only Hope under the vessel's rim before clapping on the lid. While modeling the lovely clay shape, Hephaestus invested it with human strength and gave it a human voice as well. Then the shape was taught to weave by Athena, who also dressed it; the Graces and Persuasion added jewelry for embellishment, and the Hours placed a garland of flowers around its neck. Next, Aphrodite endowed the developing form with sex appeal, and, at Zeus's command, it was then taught lies and crafty words and imbued with a cunning and deceitful nature by Hermes, whose job it was also to give Pandora speech and her name. The substance chosen for this joint Olympian enterprise was clay. Hesiod's story suggests the malleability of clay, and its capacity to assume characteristics imposed upon it. Controlling Pandora's formation, and, perhaps, subverting her, might have been considerably more diffi- cult had Hephaestus forged a metal shape, or hewn the virgin goddess out of stone. Clay was one of the materials most readily available to the ancient Greeks, who used it throughout their history for many purposes. It was (and remains) so abundant in Greece that every community had a supply of its own. Besides the widespread use of clay in the con- struction of buildings and, later, in their often quite elaborate decoration, it was of course easily accessible and traditionally used for making utilitarian pottery. Because the source of a clay object can often be identified by its color, consistency, texture, and specific mix of components, archaeologists have been able to locate some of the centers of pottery produc- tion and make regional groupings of clay prod- ucts during certain periods of history. This possibility is available only to a limited extent in the study of marble products, and is com- pletely closed to students of objects made of bronze, silver, gold, glass, or even wood, when it is preserved. The possibility of attributing clay pottery or sculpture to its place of manu- facture is immensely helpful for understanding trade between different areas of the Mediterra- nean. For example, two Hellenistic figurines clearly made from the same mold, but, when examined, each found to be made of different clays-one Attic, the other Boeotian2-dem- onstrate the exchange of molds between two regions of Greece. Further, the discovery in Corinth of a mold made of Corinthian clay but taken from a recognizably Eastern prototype or patrix reveals the source of inspiration for the beginning of the use of the mold in Greece about 700 B.C., and the nature of its reception. This essay will survey, briefly, the working of clay in the human hand before the Hellenistic period. It will review the production of clay objects before the use of the mold transformed the creation of small clay sculpture from a piece-by-piece enterprise to one of serial pro- duction and separated the art of coroplast from that of potter. I am interested in the early congruence and frequent coincidence of pur- pose between the maker of vessels, both utili- tarian and sacral, and the maker of sculptural form, human, animal, and object. Were the first Greek sculptors in clay the potters of a community? Was the hollow figurine, which had the advantage of being lighter and using less clay, invented by potters? Did the same people who made the giant pithoi-the large 29</page><page sequence="2">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - SPRING 1993 clay jars used to store grain, olives, and oil- also make what are to date the only surviving large-scale Bronze Age sculptures, also made of clay? Was the iconography of some archaic clay figurines, or parts of them, first developed for figures added to pottery? or from figures that were pottery? While the answers to these questions may, in each case, be a tentative "probably," it is un- likely that we will ever fully understand the complex and perhaps frequently changing Figure I Late Neolithic figure from Lerna (Argolid), h. 18.2 cm. -- 1 i~~f relationship between potter and maker of clay images. A brief discussion of some representa- tive works from pre-Hellenistic times, how- ever, may allow a glimpse of the early Greek artist at work in clay. The emphasis here will be on small figurative sculpture, but the wide- ranging usefulness of this versatile material in antiquity-for everything from bathtubs to temple roofs and temple decoration-should not be forgotten. Early Clay Figures The use of Greek clay for images of the human figure began as early as the seventh millennium,3 thousands of years before the ninth century B.C., when Hesiod is thought to have spun his somewhat misogynistic tale of Pandora's crafting. Some of the earliest female idols, suggesting cults of a fertile mother-deity, were modeled freely by hand and simply dried in the sun. By the late Neolithic period such figures were baked, and can be called true terracottas. While more slender than many figures from this time that are carved from stone, a fragmentary clay figure found in a fourth-millennium excava- tion level at Lerna on the Argolid has the charac- teristic steatopygous buttocks and heavy thighs (fig. 1).4 A little over eighteen centimeters high, and impressive even without her head and the lower parts of both legs, the idol draws her arms close to her rib cage above a protruding belly suggestive of her fecundity and the well-being she may represent. Another late Neolithic clay female, found at the site of Sesklo in Thessaly and also missing her head, sits on a four-legged stool cradling a baby in her arms (fig. 2). The painted stripes and spirals baked with the piece relate it directly to a category of Neolithic Thessalian pottery called Dimini ware, named for the site where it was first found,5 and suggest a close relationship between vessel- making and free-form sculp- ture in Thessaly at that time. If it was a potter who decorated the surface of the figure before it was baked, which seems very likely, it is highly probable that Figure 2 Late Neolithic figure from Sesklo (Thessaly), h. 15 cm.

National 4 Museum, Athens. the same potter modeled it. So appropriate in placement is the spiral painted in the con- tracted lap area, and so effectively do the col- ored lines encircling the arms and legs emphasize and enhance their swollen tubular forms, that it is clear whoever painted them thoroughly understood the sculpture's vol- umes. The unity of the decoration with the volumetric structure suggests that this work is the creation of a single imagination. Small Bronze Age vessels that are at the same time small sculptures suggest a continuing identification between potters and the creators of clay images. The famous mid-third-millen- nium clay vessel from the Cycladic island of Syros in the appealing shape of a small hedge- hog with a shallow dish in his front paws is painted with geometric designs (fig. 3). These designs both conform to and amplify the vol- umes of the piece and are at the same time descriptive: the creature's back is a pattern of small, rectangular units suggestive of the hedgehog's spines. Other lines are expressive as well as descriptive: the creature's big, soulful eyes are strategically placed dots in painted circles. A clay bull-leaping vessel from an early second-millennium tholos tomb at Koumasa on Crete, which balances on three short legs, has much less painted decoration than the hedgehog, but the few strokes of dark paint on the beast's belly are carefully placed so as to emphasize its bulk and mass (fig. 4). Clinging to the bull's head are three bull-leapers: one behind, and clinging to, each horn, and one spread-eagled on the bull's muzzle. An early representation of the taurokathapsia, or bull- leaping, performed by young men and women and popular in Minoan Crete, this is a fully developed little sculpture. At the same time it is a ritual vessel used for pouring libations, a rhyton, with an opening above the bull's tail for filling the vessel with liquid and an opening at the bull's mouth for pouring. The large arched handle was used to carry the vessel and to tip it for pouring. Minoan rhytons were also made in the form of human votaries, or per- haps idols, the figure (gender unclear) repre- sented to just below belly length (fig. 5). The painted decoration on these is descriptive: an elaborate rendering of costume. The little idols modeled by the Mycenaeans in solid clay that were so ubiquitous on the main- land of Greece somewhat later-from the fif- teenth to the thirteenth centuries B.c.-are also painted in patterns suggesting clothing (fig. 6).

Musee du Louvre. with red-brown paint, may have been made by potters as a sideline, or possibly by village women at home.6 Though found in shrines and houses as well, they are most commonly found in graves, suggesting they may have held some special meaning for their owners. The Clay Women of Keos Nothing made during the Bronze Age in clay or any other material, in Crete or on the mainland, compares to the group of more than fifty nearly life-size clay women votaries found in hundreds of fragments in a shrine context in Ayia Irini on the Cycladic island of Keos, apparently broken and buried in a disaster (figs. 7a and b). Published in 1986 by Miriam Caskey,7 these clay statues are one of the most extraordinary archaeological finds of the past few decades. While a few fragments of large anthropomorphic terracotta statues exist from Crete, nothing precisely like the Keos figures has been found anywhere else in the Mediterranean. They are made of local, that is, Kean, clay. Except for one which is Mycenaean, the statues are believed to have been produced over a period of time during the middle years of the second millennium, beginning in the mid-fifteenth century B.C. and continuing until sometime in the twelfth century B.C., when a disaster de- stroyed them. The fragments span many excava- tion levels. When assembled, many of the figures proved to be a meter or more high. While they are alike in a very general way, as many as fifteen groups could be distinguished by the detection of somewhat different techniques in their manufac- ture and a variety of details, suggesting they are the work of many artisans. The figures either stand or dance; they are clad in similar fashion with full skirts, heavy girdles, and short-sleeved jackets exposing the breasts. Although it has been suggested that these terracotta statues are cheap substitutes for comparable Cretan examples in wood, the excavator dismisses this; given the truth of clay to its own nature in their formation, copying an image of another substance seems an un- likely motive for the people who made them. They were produced by combining free model- ing with a pot-making method, the so-called open-pot technique used in the Bronze Age for making pithoi. The statues were made skillfully from the bottom up, the skirts worked up- wards to the waist from coils of clay of varying thickness laid one upon the other in a rising, circular wall. The coils were then either smoothed level, both outside and inside, or, most often, covered with smooth layers of clay. This open-pot clay technique stopped at waist height. In the construction of most, the inser- tion of a wooden pole at this point facilitated the modeling of the rest of the body around it. Other wooden elements were set into the clay for support, like an armature, whenever neces- sary-for the arms, for instance. In several 32</page><page sequence="5">EARTH AND WATER: EARLY TRADITIONS AND USES OF ANCIENT GREEK CLAY ~JII Figures 7a and 7b Front and side of a monumental clay figure from Bronze Age Keos (Cyclades), mid- I 5th to 1 2th century B.C., h. 98 cm; orig. h. est. 1 05 cm. Deutsches Archaologisches Institut, Athens. examples, conical clay cups were used as cores for the modeling of the breasts. (As Caskey suggests, the idea for cores and armatures in the lost-wax bronze casting technique may well have arisen from the experience of building such clay figures.) In two or three of the fig- ures, including the later Mycenaean one, both skirt and torso were built up in coils, hollow with thin walls, apparently made separately and then joined. Girdle, flounces, and breasts were then added to the surface. The figures were fired standing up, perhaps in the same big ovens used to fire pithoi. Indeed, the excavator has suggested that the creators of these remarkable statues may well have been the same potters who produced the large utilitarian clay jars for the inhabitants of Keos. After firing, the flesh areas of the statues were painted white. Traces of yellow on some of the skirts and red on a garland suggest that the clothing was brightly colored. The figures were apparently placed in some arrangement in a shrine that may have been an important cult center. Very few of the heads have survived: only six with the face more or less intact, and a few fragments. Caskey believes they may have been retrieved from the damaged shrine and saved for re-use, perhaps elsewhere, as sacred objects, a practice for which evidence was discovered in a considerably later level of the Keos sanctuary itself. A head (fig. 8) discovered in a late Geo- metric level (eighth century B.C.) with a ring stand for its presentation was found to belong to one of the statues in the debris left from the disaster of some four centuries before. Wheels, Molds, and Free Modeling VWhile these remarkable clay statues were set up in the shrine on Keos, and for some centu- ries after their destruction, half-life-size terracotta figures of votaries were being made in Crete on the potter's wheel (fig. 9). With arms raised in the gesture of a divinity or adorant, these clay women have cylindrical, hollow, wheelmade skirts and upper bodies to the chin, with freely modeled arms and heads. Their separate and movable feet, also modeled, were hung within their skirts. Such figurines were found exclusively in shrines, both palatial and domestic. The earliest come from the thirteenth-century B.C. Shrine of the Double Axes at Knossos. Human figures from roughly the same period, likewise with wheelmade bodies and freely modeled heads and arms, have also been found on the mainland of Greece, notably in the House of the Idols at Mycenae. The wheel-turning technique, how- ever, is believed to be Cretan in origin. The survival of the two important craft tech- niques of wheel turning and free modeling- used alone or together-seems to have maintained, on their level, a certain cultural continuity during the so-called Dark Age after the collapse of the Greek Bronze Age civiliza- 33</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - SPRING 1993 tion in the twelfth century B.C. The use of hollow molds for making objects of clay was by no means unknown at this time, however. Aside from the possible use of molds in the production of some bull rhyta excavated from houses on the island of Pseira near Crete, some Minoan jewelry was made in molds, and molds were used to impress designs on clay relief .&gt; pithoi.8 While apparently no molds for the production of clay figures or ves- sels have been discovered in Minoan contexts as early as the date of the Pseira bull rhyta (sixteenth to fif- teenth centuries B.C.), the concept existed, as bronze was cast in Crete in the lost-wax technique, and the mold for a bronze hand was found at Phaistos. If molds were used for making clay figures in Late Minoan Crete, the practice was discontinued for many centuries. Figure 8 Head of a monumental clay figure from Bronze Age Keos (Cyclades), mid- I 5th to 1 2th century B.C., h. 22 cm. The cylindrical horse body of the famous clay centaur from Lefkandi, in Euboea, dated by archaeological context to about goo B.C., was turned on a wheel, following the Cretan tradi- tion (fig. lo). The horse's solid hind legs were then added to one end, and an entire clay human body-torso with solid head, arms, and legs with human knees-was attached to form the front of the centaur. There are two holes in the hollow body, one in the front, in the belly area, another in the horse back. They are larger than need be for vents, and it is pos- sible that the centaur was originally produced as a rhyton. While its expressive power as sculpture almost overwhelms any thought of utilitarian purpose, in all probability the cen- taur was created by a potter. The centaur is painted in Late Protogeometric designs. While the pattern on his chest may suggest hair, and the skeletal articulation of his fingers is delineated, these designs do not otherwise seem to have very clear anatomical meaning other than differentiating units of the body. The groin is set off from the legs, the arms and neck are different patterns, etc. The bold painted designs add strength to the char- acterization of an alert and powerful creature, a characterization emphasized by the facial expression and the big, rounded horse ears. In his upraised left hand the centaur originally held a branch or small tree; his horse tail is also missing. Hollow, wheelmade human figures appear again in the eighth century B.C. on Crete, and towards the end of that century on Samos and on mainland Greece. The neck of a Geometric- period clay helmeted head from Amyclae, south of Sparta, is wheelmade, suggesting it Figure 9 Sub-Minoan figure with up- raised arms from Karphi (Crete), 13th century B.C., h. 68 cm.

Archaeological Museum, Eretria, inv. no. 8620. was originally attached to a wheelmade body, while the head itself was made by hand (figs. iha and b). The head is covered with white slip, eyes and hair painted in black; a red meander pattern as well as horizontal and diagonal bands decorate the conical helmet. The helmet has an independent sculptural quality, however stylized, and its painted ornament, though Geometric, cannot be said to be totally dependent on the pottery of the time. Attic Geometric potters at this time added small hand-modeled horses to their wheelmade pyxides, further suggesting that the crafts of potter and statuette-maker were still closely allied (fig. 12). Use of the Mold The date usually suggested for the beginning of the use of the mold for small clay sculpture in Greece is about 700 B.C.

Archaeological Museum, Thera, inv. no. 392. w late Daedalic style (the ultimate origin of which, like the invention of the mold, must have been Eastern), the mold in which this head was made may well have been created to produce heads to be added as ornaments on clay vessels. The figure's left hand grasps the hair on the side of her head, while her right hand is poised to scratch her cheek.9 This is an unusually expressive gesture of mourning, an addition of the statuette's creator. Brown locks are painted between the fingers of her right hand. She wears a long chiton with short sleeves, tightly belted, painted only on the front. Figures with moldmade heads, wheelmade skirts, and handmade torsos and arms have been found in Tanagra in contexts of the first half of the sixth century B.C. Others of the same date have freely modeled heads, which are more naturalistic and less masklike than the Daedalic face on the Theran figure. Still other figures from Tanagra have moldmade heads and freely modeled bodies which are oddly flattened. The wheel was used to make the polos on the head of such a figure now in the British Museum'0 (fig. 14). About 575 B.C., several groups of widely ex- ported sculptural moldmade vases developed from an earlier type called the Gorgoneion, which had originated somewhere in the eastern Greek world. An alabastron made of Rhodian clay, from the middle of the sixth century B.C., was found in Thebes (Boeotia) (fig. 15). Twenty-six centimeters high, it illustrates a type of figure popular for both perfume vases and for figurines during the archaic period: a woman in a chiton and short diagonal mantle holding a dove tightly by the feet in her left hand close to her breast. The right hand pulls her chiton to one side as she steps forward. Frequently, at this time, the same molds were used for both vessels and statuettes, suggesting that the traditional alliance between the potter and the maker of images in clay continued, though they now began to have more distinctly different motives. The kind of figures repre- 36</page><page sequence="9">EARTH AND WATER: EARLY TRADITIONS AND USES OF ANCIENT GREEK CLAY Figure 14 Female figure found in Tanag-a in 1875.

Evidence of the coincidence of the potter's and the sculptor's ambition can still be found in Athens in the second half of the sixth century B.C. Both the body, from the neck to the knees, and the head of the famous kneeling-boy alabastron from the Athenian Agora, 25.5 centi- meters high, were cast in two-sided molds (fig. 16). The neck was thrown on the potter's wheel, and the arms were modeled separately by hand and added. The alabastron is a master- piece of figural vase production. The decora- tion is that of a potter, a glaze made of thinned clay fired with the object. Black slip covers the neck and mouth of the vase, outlines the youth's eyes, and demarcates the pupils and brows. Clay objects of this nature did not in- fluence the subsequent development of the Hellenistic moldmade figures, which were covered with white slip and brightly colored Figure 1 5 Rhodian alabastron in the shape of a young woman found in Thebes (Boeotia), c. 560-550 B.C., h. 26 cm.

Coroplasts were equally imaginative with small sculptures, however, while from the fourth century B.C. and throughout the Helle- nistic period, much pottery was also made partially or entirely in molds.
