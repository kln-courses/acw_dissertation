<plain_text><page sequence="1">80 SHOFAR Spring 1993 Vol. 11, No. 3 ETTY HILLESUM'S AN INTERRUPTED LIFE : SEARCHING FOR THE HUMAN by Bernard Weinstein Dr. Weinstein is Professor of English at Kean College of New Jersey, where he is involved with an oral history proj- ect of the Holocaust Resource Center. He has published other essays on the Holocaust and is currently writing a biography of Michel Thomas, educator, Holocaust survivor, French Resistance fighter, and counter-intelligence officer during World War II. There is a special poignancy in reading the diary of one who did not survive the Shoah, for in such a memoir, as in a Sophoclean tragedy, the audience knows the protagonist's fate, at which the protagonist can only guess. At the same time the protagonist's words resonate with the hope, the ambition, the desperate energy, and, sometimes, the "enlightenment" that precede terminal despair. Esther ("Etty") Hillesum, the Dutch-Jewish diarist, died in Auschwitz, probably on November 30, 1943. 1 Her parents and her brother Mischa were probably already dead by this time; the older of her two brothers, Jaap, survived the death camp only to perish in transit as he was returning to Holland after the war. Lacking the perspective of a survivor, she was still able to transcribe with evolving awareness what was developing around her. Yet, what is even more extraordinary, Etty was able to complete and to record in less than three years an internal evolution that took her from self-involvement to cosmic consciousness and dialogue with God, and, finally, to the translation of her spirituality into activity in behalf of her fellow Jews on the verge of extinction. On July 10, 1942 Etty wrote, "...

Originally she had wanted to become a writer, not to chronicle suffering in the Shoah (there is little of the wrenching detail in her diary of the genre we call Holocaust testimony), but rather to unshackle herself, as a self-liberating woman might some four decades later, from "so many inhibitions, so much fear of letting go" (p. 1). She probes like a novelist into her character's life and motivation. Her diary begins on March 9, 1941, with heady and nervous anticipation ("Here goes, then") and launches almost immediately into her adeptness as a lover and her concern that longing for a man might possibly inhibit her freedom. Ironically, though, it is one man, Julius Spier, to whom Etty is both erotically and spiritually drawn, who is her major catalyst to self-affirmation. Born into a relatively affluent background, Etty, who was 27 when she began keeping the diary, seemed only peripherally affected by the fate of Jews in other parts of Europe. It has been pointed out that the abundance of Jews designated "privileged" in Holland fostered "an illusion of security" among many Jews and those Dutch sympathetic to them.2 The first anti-pogrom strike in Europe had broken out in Amsterdam one month before Etty began her diary, and, what was surprising, some nine months after Holland's capitulation: . . . the February strike was for many Jews the greatest experience of the whole war. The reason for this was simple: for once, albeit for but a little while, they did not feel their Dutch compatriots were leaving them in the lurch. Behind them now stood openly a group of their fellow-citizens, men with whom they had lived at peace for centuries. This group dared to brave a ruthless enemy, and was ready to sacrifice life and property- for them.3 The mandatory wearing of the Star of David did not begin until April 1942. After this ruling, forced relocation to Westerbork and immediate or eventual deportation to Auschwitz of Sobibor became the order of the day. Meanwhile Etty lived in a comfortable house at 6 Gabriel Metsustraat in South Amsterdam, where she worked as a semi-housekeeper for the 62- year-old owner of the house, Han Wegerif, with whom she became lovers. "Her room on the third floor overlooked the Museumplein, the main 2Leni Yahil, The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jeu&gt;ry, 1932-1945 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 440. 3Jacob Presser, Ashes in the Wind: The Destruction of Dutch Jewry (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1988), p. 56.</page><page sequence="3">82 SHOFAR Spring 1993 Vol. 11, No. 3 square in Amsterdam, with the Concert-hall at one end, the Rijksmuseum at the other, and a skating rink in the middle during the winter" (p. x). Etty came from a highly assimilated family, even though her grandfa- ther was a prominent Dutch rabbi. Her parents lived a financially comfortable, though at times emotionally stormy, domestic life in Deventer, a city east of Amsterdam. Her father was a scholar of classics and the headmaster of the Municipal Gymnasium, which Etty and her brothers attended. The older of her brothers, Jaap, was a doctor, and Mischa was a gifted musician. Etty herself had studied law and Slavonic languages at the University of Amsterdam and was now involved with post-baccalaureate work in psychology. The domestic friction between her emotional mother and her temperamentally opposite father did not prevent the children from being taught that humankind might be bettered by the general application of reason and idealism. Her diary begins in the atmosphere of graduate study, amid stimulat- ing companions, able to discourse fluently on food, love, philosophy, politics, and literature. Away from her parents' home in Deventer, she became sexually emancipated, and, as the diary opens, had just met Spier, a 54-year-old Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. He was divorced from his German wife and had been the protegee of Jung, who encouraged him to pursue his interest in psychochirology, the study of palm prints as an index to human personality. Opinion is split on the issue of Spier's character and "authenticity" (he had previously been a banker and publisher), but for Etty he became a "magical personality" who aided her in overcoming what she called her "spiritual constipation" (p. 4). He was a guru who created an ashram of mostly female devotees, and he "counseled" them in diminishing their inhibitions through the primal therapy of wrestling matches in which he "floored" (or, in Etty's case, was floored by) them. Falling under his spell, Etty began to "wrestle" also with her characteristic libidinous possessiveness, until, under Spier's own guidance, she concluded that she would have to share him with others. Much of the first half of the book is taken up with Etty's soul as a battleground for Eros and agape. They became lovers and confidantes, and somehow he taught her spiritual and emotional freedom, even as he dominated her thoughts, her passions, and her writing. Simultaneously enraptured and repelled by collision with Spier's personality, she tried to organize the ocean of her being into islands of self-mastery. Her possessiveness and manipulativeness gradually gave way to confidence and detachment. Wanting to commit herself to "the love you can apply to small everyday things," and "to what shines through from within" (pp. 22, 23), she concluded that she would have to expunge hatred from her heart. She</page><page sequence="4">Etty Hillesum's An Interrupted Life 83 had for some time carried around with her Rilke's poems and Dostoyev- sky's The Idiot. She was determined not to hate her enemy. With an idealism both visionary and exasperating to all but the most innocent voyagers through life, she could write of a particularly brutal SS officer she had encountered, "I felt no indignation, rather a real compassion, and would have liked to ask, 'Did you have an unhappy childhood, has your girlfriend let you down?"' (p. 72). Yet these lapses into indiscriminate sympathy were usually short-lived. With growing intensity she could recognize, not the absence of malice and hate, but rather the susceptibility of every human heart to their habitation therein. At one point she chides a fellow student who despairs over the destructiveness of human beings, "... remember that you're one yourself ... I really see no other solution than to turn inward and root out all the rottenness there" (pp. 70-71). In another passage she moves almost immediately from a mood of transcendent joy to one of painful reality. She waxes lyrical over the vision of a cyclist wearing a yellow star defiantly on his chest with the sun rising above him, "so radiant and smiling did he look"; only a line later, she reprimands herself: "Come now, Etty my girl, things aren't all as congenial as you make out, and you really seem to gloss things over with your flights of poetry. ... I don't fool myself for one single moment about the gravity of it all" (p. 109). If Spier taught her how to emancipate herself from him and from her destructive emotions, he also taught her how to "kneel," not to another human, but to God. Part of their mystical "intimacy" expressed itself in their reading the Bible together. Never "religious" in the traditional Jewish sense, Etty, nevertheless, lamented that her parents "always felt out of their depth, and as life became more and more difficult they were gradually so overwhelmed that they became quite incapable of making up their minds about anything. They gave us children too much freedom of action, and offered us nothing to cling to" (p. 64). As her absorption in God grew more intense, she experienced less of an Essence rooted in nature and more of an indwelling Spirit which rooted her in reality. "I am no fanciful visionary, God, no schoolgirl with a beautiful soul. I try to face up to Your world, God, not to escape from reality into beautiful dreams, though I believe that beautiful dreams can exist beside the most horrible reality- and I continue to praise Your creation, God, despite everything" (p. 114). Her dialogues with God, the mirror of her most inner life, are remarkably clearsighted, unclouded by any kind of wishful thinking. She has no illusions about the fate of Jews, herself included. She knows that they are doomed. She offers neither prayers nor special pleading for God's mercy. If God exists for man it is man's role to affirm that existence.</page><page sequence="5">84 SHOFAR Spring 1993 Vol. 11, No. 3 Without illusion or pretense of being able to benefit any other individual directly, she boldly asserts, ". . . if God does not help me to go on, then I shall have to help God" (p. 147). God for her is neither traditionally anthropomorphic, nor omnipotent, as in Job , nor perversely silent as in the writings of Elie Wiesel. God is made manifest through man's deeds. Without conventional religiosity, Etty Hillesum begins to affirm actively the Hebrew doctrine of tikkuw. man's partnership with God in the ultimate bettering of the world. What value, though, did tikkun have in a world tilted toward annihilation? Beginning midway through the diary she becomes conscious of the public role she must play: healer and witness, working first, briefly, for the Jewish Council (Joodse Raad), then voluntarily accepting intern- ment in Westerbork. Those who infer an ascetic, neurotic, or suicidal motive for her actions might examine with particular care those entries that precede her going to work in the Council's Cultural Affairs Department. They are filled with life and determination to experience each moment deeply. The persistent vision she has of "poisonous green smoke" and the corpses in Poland cannot obliterate the reality of the smell of jasmine on a summer afternoon. "... I can sit for hours and know everything and bear everything and grow stronger in the bearing of it, and at the same time feel sure that life is beautiful and worth living and meaningful" (p. 129). Four days after she heard that Mischa had been taken off to Drenthe, she could echo the same idea, although with less alacrity: "I am filled with confidence not that I shall succeed in worldly things, but that even when things go badly for me I shall find life good and worth living" (p. 147). Were these random utterances, the reader might be justifiably incredulous, but there is clearly a piercing intensity in Etty's celebrating the immediacy of life and her joy in creation amid the grotesque paradox of an over- whelmingly malevolent world. For approximately fourteen months, between July 15, 1942 and August 6, 1943, Etty confronted, as she had never had to confront before, the reality of the doomed Jews. She already understood that they were being rounded up for transport, and she was resigned to the fact that the time would come "when we are all herded together" (p. 143). She also knew something of the cruelly desperate atmosphere of the Jewish Council, the function of which was mediation between Nazis and Jews, the burden of which was the specific decisions as to who would live and who would die. "I hope," she wrote on the eve of her first day at the Council, "to be a centre of peace in that madhouse" (p. 156).</page><page sequence="6">Etty Hillesum's An Interrupted Life 85 Despite her brother Jaap's urgent advice, she had been reluctant to apply to work on the Council, thinking there was something "underhand" in what she had done. She compared it to "crowding on to a small piece of wood adrift on an endless ocean after a shipwreck and then saving oneself by pushing others into the water and watching them drown. It is all so ugly" (p. 152). Her revulsion at this frantic scramble for life to which she was bearing reluctant witness was mitigated only by reading Rilke. Yet she expresses her gratitude to God "for driving me from my peaceful desk into the midst of the cares and sufferings of this age" (p. 159). Depressed by the pettiness and intrigue around her, she found "the only adequate gesture" to be kneeling down before [God]." Compelled to witness what was a daily occurrence in her environment, she acknowledged the supremacy of the life within. In mid 1942 Westerbork was still populated primarily by German Jews. At approximately the time Etty had gone to work for the Council, Dutch Jews were just beginning to trickle into the camp, some to be immediately dispatched to Auschwitz, others to linger in what was considered by Nazi standards a "humane" environment.4 At the end of 1942 Etty volunteered to join a group of Dutch Jews who had been ordered into the camp. From this point on she was an inmate, albeit a privileged one, able to travel back to Amsterdam for a few days, but she became ill, was hospitalized, and her leave of absence was extended to over a month. During her stay in Amsterdam Spier became suddenly ill and died on September 15, 1942. Despite her shock at his death she resumed the diary briefly but intensely. In a passage written on September 17 she described the Westerbork experience as "the two richest and most intense months of my life" (p. 174), and a few days later she made the following entry: "Why not turn the love that cannot be bestowed on another or on the other sex into a force that benefits the whole community and that might still be love? And if we attempt that transformation in the solid ground of the real world, of reality?" (pp. 176-177). The final entry of her diary is, "We should be willing to act as a balm for all wounds" (p. 196). How much of a "balm" Etty was can never be fully ascertained. But in Boulevard des Misères: The Story of Transit Camp Westerbork Jacob Boas records that in Westerbork the Etty who worked in the Jewish Council and thought it vulgar to scramble for life, preferring to retire into a corner with Rilke, *Jacob Boas, Boulevard des Misères: The Story of Transit Camp Westerbork (Hamden, CT: Archon, 1985), p. 3-</page><page sequence="7">86 SHOFAR Spring 1993 Vol. 11, No. 3 was no longer. Saintly in her selflessness, a boundless compassion drove her. With a leather bag slung over her shoulder, in a drab raincoat she dashed from barrack to barrack to bring a ray of warmth and kindliness. A fellow inmate recalled that an age-old wisdom, a thousand year-old morning seemed to settled on her young radiant face.5 Her "Letters from Westerbork" in 1943 enunciate poignantly and eloquently the witness that she bore to the ordeal of her fellow Jews as, each Tuesday, the trains left for Poland. Prescient and resigned, she abjured both fear and self pity. Aware that she too would be sent off eventually to die, she continued to affirm the glory and magnificence of life and the possibility of creating "A whole new world." She compared the path of her life, reaching "already . . . into another world to the filaments of a spider making its web by casting the main threads ahead of itself and following them from behind" (p. 199). But she also watched her parents, now prisoners in Westerbork, as they suffered the waiting for imminent deportation to Auschwitz6 and she knew that they, like most others, found the suffering unbearable. Even those who were "strong" could not bear the mental agony of others, as she could not of her parents. Two of her Westerbork letters were published while she was still alive, by the Dutch underground press. One of them serves as a powerful closing to the book. In it she describes the evening before and the morning of the transport of August 24, 1943. Seeing the faces of the green-uniformed guards, even she despairs of finding goodness. Yet she has the feeing of being "the ears and eyes of a piece of Jewish history" as well as "a still, small voice." People had been roused in the middle of the night preceding the date of deportation. A terrified boy had tried to evade the transport, and his fellow Jews were told that he had to be found or "scores of others would be put on the transport in his place." Although he was soon found, fifty others were added to the list of deportees. "That boy," Etty remarks tersely, "is going to have a hard time" (p. 208). Returning to the night before, she speaks of helping to dress babies and calm mothers, "and that is all I can hope to do" (p. 209). She admits her own impotence: how could she deal with the shock and bewilderment of those who did not know "until the very last moment" that they would be taken? With unbearable fidelity to detail she offers small portraits of 'Boas, p. 92. ^hey had been turned down as Barriavelders , a small group of Dutch Jewish intellectuals who had been earmarked for Theresieristadt , Hitler's "Potemkin village" in Czechoslovakia. See Hillesum, p. 200; see also Boas, pp. 27, 63.</page><page sequence="8">Etty Hillesum's An Interrupted Life 87 those most affected. Working in the hospital, she approaches the bed of a young girl whose surface composure breaks down at the realization that she must leave Holland. She sees a hospital colleague squatting beside the bed of her dying mother who had swallowed poison. A young mother nearly apologizes for her baby's wails: "My baby doesn't usually cry, it's almost as if he can tell what's happening" (p. 210). A young woman dressed in a long pair of trousers, a woolen jumper and cardigan, is trying to eat a few mouldy sandwiches. She laughs, "I'll probably get quite a lot of mouldy bread to eat" (p. 213). A little woman with wet washing frantically asks anyone who can to hide her sick child. "They take sick children away," she sobs, "and you never get them back" (p. 211). A dumpy ghetto woman with greasy hair and short legs waits for the transport with her seven children: "... and they need a proper mother, believe me!" (p. 214). A dying old man is carried away reciting the Sh'ma, the prayer one says approaching death. At the transport itself Etty observes from a hiding place, a barrack directly across from the train. Normally, on a transport day, no one was allowed to leave their quarters, and a curfew was in effect from the night before until the train left. No one was permitted outside who was not part of the transport. She observes the men of the "Flying Column," the baggage handlers who brought up luggage on wheelbarrows. One of them, a comedian and song writer who had entertained the Commandant and another, a pianist, had been given "exemptions." One of the most poignant descriptions is of the singular representative of the Antragstelle which handled "appeals," trying to the last moment to get people out of the commandant's clutches. Horse- trading here always continued until the train had actually pulled out. It's even been known for him to manage to free people from the moving train. The man with the briefcase had the brow of a scholar, and tired, very tired, shoulders. A bent, little old woman, with a black old-fashioned hat on the grey, wispy hair, bars his way, gesticulating and brandishing a bunch of papers under his nose. He listens to her for a while, then shakes his head and turns away, his shoulders sagging just a bit more. This time it won't be possible to get many people off the train in the nick of time. The comman- dant is annoyed (p. 216). The Commandant had ordered scores of additional deportations in reprisal for the boy's attempt to escape. Furthermore there had been a raid by Allied planes the previous afternoon, a factor not calculated to improve his disposition. The fierce power of the Commandant is felt as he strides with his secretary past the waiting train, his face "almost iron grey." His Jewish</page><page sequence="9">88 SHOFAR Spring 1993 Vol. 11, No. 3 secretary, looking bored, is dressed in "fawn riding breeches and brown sports jacket" (p. 218). In contrast to the aloof, implacable, but eerily handsome Commandant is the Oberdienstleiter, the head of the Camp Services Corps, a German Jew, massive and cruel. Like the secretary, he demonstrates the degradation of an order which uses victim to oppress victim and create an atmosphere of cruelty, servitude, and hypocrisy. The account reaches its climax as the train doors are shut. "Shut on the herded, densely packed, mass of people inside. Through small openings we can see heads and hands, hands that will wave to us later as the train leaves" (p. 2 19). 7 On that day over one thousand Jews left Holland. On September 7, 1943, about two weeks later, she and her parents left on the same train for Auschwitz. Her friend from Westerbork, Jopie Vleeschouwer, gave a written account of Etty's departure to her friends in Amsterdam, including Han Wegerif. He described Etty's mood as buoyant, humorous, and kind, "perhaps just a touch of sadness but every inch the Etty you knew so well" (p. 221). Once she'd said, "I want to be sent to every one of the camps. ... I don't ever want to be what they call safe." If indeed she died on November 30, 1943, she lived through several weeks in a far greater hell than Westerbork. No one will ever know if her spirit of love and faith and goodness prevailed to the end. All we have are her words, and a fragment of outside testimony at the end; both of them bespeak a life of searching for and finding God and humanity. 7Another depiction of the bitter scene of departure from Westerbork with its pandemoni- um and horror is given by Presser, pp. 456-464.</page></plain_text>
