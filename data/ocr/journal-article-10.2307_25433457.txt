<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATERIA NON MEDICA Candle power is OK The New York summer nights are hot and darkness comes quickly. The night of 13 July 1977 was no exception. The better-off enjoyed the noisy coolness of air conditioning indoors; the poor sat out on steps or on window sills and talked the evening quietly away in the time-honoured fashion. An air of heat-ridden tedium pervaded. Then, lightning struck at Indian Point. This place-on the Hudson River-is the site of the central power point linking the city electricity supply to upstate New York and New England. Nature pierced the Achilles heel of the power network and plunged the metropolis into blackness. The Great Blackout of 1977 began. I was leaving a friend's apartment when the rattle of an air con ditioner coming suddenly to a powerless halt and the abrupt failure of the living room light caught us by surprise. Looking out into the street below only the lights of taxis, cars, and buses were seen illuminating the darkness. We groped for a candle and matches; in a few minutes an old-fashioned glow lit up the room. We dived for the portable radio. As the only available means of mass communication the radio stations excelled themselves. We listened eagerly as the first news of the extent of the blackout came in: all of the great city affected, and the wide stretches of neighbouring Westchester County, too. What went wrong? How were the hospitals doing? What was the Mayor saying? The announcers and reporters in the field were excited. Not since the Orson Welles affair had the radioed word been so closely followed and influential. But it was past midnight and time to go home. I groped my way down the 10-floor stairway and out into Manhattan's Second Avenue. Walking uptown, the night was teeming with life. Car headlights turned inwards across the pavements illuminated restaurants and bars and all-night grocery stores. Neighbours sitting out on steps called to me as I went by. Youths in jeans, shirtless and shoeless, were directing traffic by flashlight at intersections. There was the air of a midnight fiesta-unexpected, bizzarre, half-real-but people were enjoying it for those very qualities-a spontaneous nocturnal Mardi Gras-live while it lasted, for tomorrow brings new challenges and difficulties. But other city areas were far from festive. Gangs roamed the streets plundering shops of everything right down to the wall fittings. It was over in 24 hours: the power was flowing again. Then there were stories of hardship and opportunism, of the plight of innocent shopkeepers, and of million-dollar deals transacted at Wall Street telephone booths instead of in highrise corporate boardrooms. There were charges and counter-charges as politicians and power authorities exchanged angry verbal fusillades, which reverberate to this day. In-the perspective of two years, the frailty of the great complex of people and things called a city and its existence in apparent day-to-day normality -on the-verge of anarchy stand out. But, there is at least one reassuring note, even when lightning strikes and a city totters at the edge of a chasm-candle power is still OK.-CHARLES BREDIN (physician, New York). Ornitherapy "As dumb as a lark in August." The harvest month is a silent one as far as birdsong is concerned; the robin is about the only bird to be heard at that time and his melancholy song depresses me because it reminds me of winter. The sight of a- blackcap in a winter garden brings thoughts of summer days and cheerfulness. Especially cheering was a blackcap which I saw on a November day in a Norwegian garden, where the short, grey days of winter are particularly depressing. Who has not been moved by the sight of the first swallow of summer or on hearing the first cuckoo? I wonder where the cuckoo obtained its reputation for stupidity because, like Alfred P Doolittle, it seems to have learnt to its advantage that "Wiv a little bit of luck someone else will do the blinkin' work." But if the cuckoo is said to be stupid, what anthropomorphic qualities has the owl that it should apparently be imbued with such wisdom? On the other hand, the magpie and jackdaw undoubtedly deserve their reputations as kleptomaniacs, as anyone who has examined their nests will confirm. The disciples of Niko Tinbergen or Konrad Lorenz will main tain that all bird activities are instinctive responses to specific stimuli, either behavioural or environmental. However, neither the sentimentalist nor the ethologist would deny that the observation of birds has a real effect on their own emotions. This emotional influence can be turned -to good effect. What comfort the bird man of Alcatraz must have derived from his intimate relations with the feathered, but free, inmates of that desperate place. Connie Coke, that chronic depressive character so beautifully described by Norman Collins in London Belongs to Me was saved from suicide by devotion to her budgerigar, as numerous old ladies must have been in real life. For once she was telling the truth when she claimed before the beak that her budgie was a dependant. But I derive even more pleasure from watching birds in the wild, because they offer so much more variety. Even in the midst of our most depressing concrete deserts, birds come to the windows and, with a little encouragement in the way of food and drink, a surprising variety will collect. To the depressive or physically housebound, the simple pleasure of watching birds can be an incalculable comfort, while a deeper study of their identification and behaviour can add a new dimension to the most despondent lives. As a tranquilliser, bird watching may be as effective as any drug, but cheaper and safer than many.-R A F COX (medical director, London).</page></plain_text>
