His research has focused on Faulkner, foyce, Donald Barthelme, American Literature, American Studies, and the history of psychoanalysis. Fredric Jameson has observed that post modern intellectual activity often implies the "new work ... of rewriting all the familiar things in new terms and thus proposing modifications, new ideal perspec tives, a reshuffling of canonical feelings and values" {Postmodernism xiv). In Reverse Tradition, Robert Kiely takes up this new work of revision, "recataloguing and transcoding" (Jameson, Postmodernism xiv) by offering a series of "'consciously anachro nistic readings' of nineteenth century novels through a variety of postmodern fictional lenses" (5): Melville's Benito Cere?o after Beckett, Twain's The Mysterious Strangerafter Borges, Hawthorne's The Marble Faun after Nabokov, Charlotte Bronte's Villette after Morrison's Beloved, Hardy's The Woodlanders after Erdrich's Tracks, Eliot's Romola after Kingston's The Woman Warrior. In each pair ing, the nineteenth-century text is read with the contemporary text(s) already in mind, and the effect of this sequential contiguity is to make the earlier text seem more postmod ern. In this way, the linear narrative of liter ary and cultural history, whose master plot is 172</page><page sequence="2">the influence of the past upon the present, may be confused if not reversed altogether, as the postmodern text, deliberately placed in the "antecedent" position, is allowed to work a transformative effect upon the 19th-century text that is read in its wake. In Kiely's method, in other words, it is the read er who determines the positionality of the nineteenth-century text, the degree to which it seen as "locked in a set of cultural values and categories which are in full postmodernism demonstrably antiquated and 'historical'" (Jameson, Postmodernism 69) or as liberated from its own time so that it can emerge?its "formal and ideological latencies'" now mobilized (Kiely 5)?as a fully contemporary participant in the construction of meaning.1 In complicating any conventional notion of the relations between the primary and the secondary, the before and the after, the nineteenth-century and the postmodern text, Kiely's method, it is tempting to think, suggests nothing but an unequivocal gain for readerly pleasure and speculative imag ination?a gain wrested from the rational, chronological, proscriptive, and determinate realms of literary and cultural history as it has been written. Kiely must acknowledge the historical fact of a text's having been written and pub lished earlier or later than another in order to set up his initial pairing of texts, but thereafter, that fact loses any privileged status as he attempts to determine the logic of their narrative and sequential relations. Any such logic is an effect of the reader's manipulation of perspective: the text we place in the antecedent position becomes the "primary" text simply because the "sec ondary" text, by definition, may be read as, in some sense, its reflection, rep etition, or extension. As one might expect, before very long there is no such thing as an ear lier or a later text any more, and this is precisely the effect Kiely wishes to achieve. He shrewdly notes that, sooner or later, "literature' makes Tweedledee and Tweedledum of nunc and tune. It is the historian's under standable task to resist this tendency. But its consequences are not all nega tive" (35). With Baudrillard he observes postmodernity's tendency to scatter, confuse, and flatten out the orders of diachrony and history, citing the tech nology of videotape montage as the characteristic mode of historical efface ment: "Present and past images are mixed in no necessary order; fact and fiction are made part of the same 'scene,' not through a painful psychic process or by means of an extraordinary leap of the imagination, but simply because both are edited and interspersed with a frequency that makes the very idea of chronological order seem like slow motion" (3). In this sense, the only chronology that ultimately matters in Kiely's method is the phenomenological chronology of the reading experience itself. One hesitates to deny oneself the hermeneutical pleasures enabled by the suspension of the conventional laws of historical causation, but, like all such pleasures, they risk running away with themselves. Once set in motion, the processes of signification and meaning-making, though ostensibly delimited in Kiely's method by the framed apposition of texts, are not to be fastened too tightly to any narrative of literary relationships, cultural influences, or Michael Zeitlin 173</page><page sequence="3">material conditions. They are mainly to be explored for their own sake, even if there be no logical or theoretical end (short of death) to the narrative inter play among texts it may be possible to set into motion. Kiely's "principle of thrift in the proliferation of meaning," his "necessary or constraining figure" (Foucault 119), is not the author but the sequential framing device (this text "after" that one) and the "postmodern" theme, whether it occurs in the nine teenth century or the contemporary text: "the malleable and arbitrary nature of semantic, historical, and narrative time" (107); "the inescapably fictitious nature of linguistic, legal, and literary norms" (116); the "order and authori ty [that] are invoked only to be exposed as spurious" (117), and so on. Since he is after similarity and resemblance, and since he is appropriately skeptical about claims of "depth integration" (Jameson, "Ulysses in History" 175) in the age of the simulacrum and the proliferating sign-sprawl, Kiely must rely, by definition as it were, on the observance of "surface" resem blances. Rhetorically, this work of comparison proceeds mainly by means of similes and adjectives deployed by a self-consciously speculative imagina tion: the textual history of Twain's text is "Borgesian" (105); "As Twain's nar ratives run down, they become more and more like a Borgesian coin point ing indifferently in all directions or none" (117); "Late in the manuscript of 'No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger' is a passage Borges might have chosen for the 'right' ending ..." (120); "That the text proclaims its various levels of fraudulence without seeming able to reveal an authentic alternative gives it, at certain angles, its American, postmodern, and Borgesian veneer" (121); "The prominence of interpretation as a problem and game for characters as well as readers is a marked characteristic of all of Hawthorne's fiction, as it is of Nabokov's" (157); "In an introduction to one of his own novels as a 'hell of mirrors' . . . Nabokov could have been describing The Marble Faun" (158). To be sure, this noticing of resemblances is imaginative and interesting, but it may also leave one desiring a critical narrative less reliant on the making (as opposed to the revealing) of connections. For Kiely, the irreverent framing of anachronistic readings leads to an enhanced hermeneutical pleasure; for Gordon Slethaug, even a perfectly respectable framing of texts engenders, in the first instance, a heavy sense of guilt. At the outset of The Play of the Double in Postmodern American Fiction, Slethaug cites Foucault on the dangers of "closure and teleology" (7), of "any certainty in the presentation of the history of ideas, for [Foucault] finds that history is a reflection of the people who write it and hence invent it rather than a valid, objective interpretation of indisputable facts" (7). Foucault reverberates as a kind of superego function, weaving a network of prohibi tions and warnings along any path the critic may choose to explore, in this case "the play of the postmodern double" in Nabokov's Despair, Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, Hawkes' Blood Oranges, Barth's Lost in the Funhouse, Brautigan's Hawkline Monster, and Federman's Double or Nothing. In accor dance with Foucault 's warnings and Slethaug's announced theme, those val ues associated with "unitary" wholeness, coherence, stability, reason, and 174 College Literature</page><page sequence="4">meaning are to be suspected and warded off, even if they are never to be escaped absolutely. Hence Slethaug acknowledges that, perforce, his study "risks [my emphasis] creating origins, installing fixed categories, controlling knowledge, attempting to understand the past through present circumstances and beliefs" (8). As a countermeasure against such "totalizing" impulses, Slethaug suggests that his "readers should rightly challenge some of my implicit assumptions and explicit categories" (6). Some of these may indeed be challenged from the outset. "Nabokov, Pynchon, Hawkes, and Barth are chosen," writes Slethaug, "not only because of their pervasive use of the double but because they are generally consid ered to be among the most important postmodern American writers . . ." (6). This is a surprisingly passive and circular way of justifying the subject mat ter of the book. To be sure, there are compelling reasons for discussing these writers in one place (and I should like to note that the book is worth read ing for its splendid discussion of Gravity's Rainbow alone), but the multiple and complex assumptions inherent in the view that these are important writ ers would be ones a Foucauldian analysis might be expected to scrutinize with special intensity. Moreover, in Foucauldian terms, it is the awareness of what is excluded by the critical gaze and its structuring action that needs to find a place, somehow, in the analysis. In acknowledging that "Other figures, such as Barthelme and Vonnegut, could no doubt be added, but their inclu sion would not significantly alter my thesis" (6), Slethaug succeeds only in begging the question: would the thesis be altered if Toni Morrison or Don DeLillo (say) were included? Slethaug could do more to theorize and prob lematize his selection of texts. Slethaug's main thesis is that postmoderns have transformed the double from an alternative self to an ironic literary device that undermines suggestions of universal harmony, essential duality, psychological wholeness, or stable signification. The con cept of the double has broken loose from its traditional literary and psy chological moorings and now shares common features with poststructural ist criticism?that of Lacan, Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida?that explores, and often rejects, the nature and implications of the binary systematizing of self, social patterns, and language. (30) It is an ironical and observable fact that those for whom binary systematiz ing is a major polemical target can be very much dominated by its cognitive mechanisms. Slethaug's comprehensive binary apparatus may be defined as the postmodern double/the traditional double, the bar separating the polar terms signifying the proscriptive action of the first upon the second. If "his new antimimetic double" (188) "confirms the split sign, the split self, and the split text" (3), it also "denfiesj spiritual and psychological completeness or transhistorical, permanent meaning" (5), "rejectfsj the existence of con sistent personalities and psychological wholeness as well as any stable rela tionship between signifiers and signified" (5), and "is opposed to the idea of a knowable, integrated self within a comprehensible self-contained frame of Michael Zeitlin 175</page><page sequence="5">historical reality and metaphysics" (188, my emphasis). The thematic con tent of this binary structure is inherited from the much celebrated but insufficiently historicized polemical ethos of post-war intellectual culture in France, for which "the Bourgeois norm" must always be "the essential enemy" (Barthes 9). Accordingly, for Slethaug, the postmodern double is to be defined in abstract and linguistic, as opposed to anthropomorphic and humanistic, terms: "The double is not a spirit, thing, or person but an ever-elusive, con stantly changing mode of conceptualizing through language" (25); "the rhetorical figure of the double is not only a specific signifier but also a field of discourse" (187). The field of the double is as large as language itself, that vast symbolic order posited on difference, in which any given signifier is the potential double of all the other signifiers it has displaced. Because he wants to show, moreover, how the postmodern play of the double moves deci sively beyond older, more traditional, more humanistic versions, Slethaug is necessarily bound to a narrative of theoretical and conceptual progress whose plot may be summed up as "Lacan and poststructuralism over Freud and humanism." Slethaug is right to note that Freud is inevitably linked with the "traditional concept of the double," but he is not right, in turn, to align Freudian metapsychology with "rational humanist views of a unified and sta ble self (2). Equally it is quite misleading to speak of "Lacan's break from . . . Freud's . . . conception of a unified, totalized personality" (20).2 Indeed it is Lacan who links Freud's name with "a revolution in knowledge worthy of the name of Copernicus," for "as a result of that discovery [Freud's discovery of the unconscious] the very center of the human being was no longer to be found at the place assigned to it by a whole humanist tradition" (114). These words should make us suspicious of any master narrative in which "new" ideas perform the task of comprehensively sweeping away the old: "This new Lacanian view of self and language has made untenable traditional ramifications of the psychological double ..." (21); "postmodernism has demolished this previous [Freudian and humanist] epistemology ..." (188). I cannot speculate what Slethaug has in mind when he claims that "Nabokov has nothing to do with Freud's and Jung's behaviorist theories" (93, my emphasis), but the narrative of progress he wishes to project by his rhetoric is clear enough: "The literature of the double . . . has moved well beyond its traditional dualistic moorings" (197), achieving in the process a kind of rad ical orgastic freedom: "The literary double is inexhaustible, capable of being renewed an infinite number of times" (194). With this formulation, any guilt bound up with the reification of his torical limits and textual borders finally dissolves in the pleasures of an incredibly expanding textuality. In this sense, Slethaug exceeds Kiely in the intensity of his desire to assimilate history and tradition into that imperial izing present tense known as postmodernism. For Kiely, past texts are made into present ones when they are read according to the reader's pre 176 College Literature</page><page sequence="6">sent position, interests, and pleasures; for Slethaug, the past (with its tradi tional values, codes, categories, and ideas) is displaced entirely by the new postmodern play of the double, or the borderless, depthless field of dis course as defined by poststructuralism. Their insights and provocative read ings notwithstanding, both books will frustrate the kind of readerly plea sure that likes to build an imaginative awareness of historical depth into the structure of its pursuit of meaning. NOTES 2The idea that the present can transform the past has a modernist genealogy. As T. S. Eliot famously observed, "What happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all works of art which preceded it. . . . The past [is] altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past" (qtd. in Kiely 5). In the psychoanalytic view of time, "consciousness constitutes its own past, constantly subjecting its meaning to revision in conformity with its 'project'. . . . the subject revises past events at a later date and ... it is this revision which invests them with significance ..." (Laplanche and Pontalis 112). For Harold Bloom, the uncanny effects of "deferred action" are to be enjoyed aesthetically: "In the exquisite squalors of Tennyson's The Holy Grail, as Percival rides out on his ruinous quest, we can experience the hallucination of believing that the Laureate is overly influenced by The Waste land, for Eliot too became a master at reversing the apophrades [the return of the dead]" (142). By the time we get to Slajov Zizek, hallucination yields to empirical demonstration: "Richard II proves beyond any doubt that Shakespeare had read Lacan . . ." (9). 2It would be hard to improve upon Malcolm Bowie's summary of the relevant matter: Far from adopting a unified view of selfhood from classical psychology, Freud found the human mind to be all too plainly self-divided and disputatious. His mental mod els, far from being clear-contoured experimental hypotheses, easily came apart into riddles and paradoxes. The notion of an integrated ego, buoyantly pursing its goals and deflecting its antagonists, has the force not of an observable fact or of a logical necessity but of a wish, a hope, a recommendation. . . . For Freud, all hopes of per fect self-possession were idle, and the dealings between id, ego and super-ego could never be expected to reach a final point of settlement. His tripartite mind, like its bipartite predecessor, had conflict as its inescapable native condition. The mind had integrative capacities, of course, and the skilled therapist could cooperate with these during treatment, but no peaceable kingdom, where all mental ghosts and demons would finally be laid to rest, awaited the human subject and his travelling compan ions at the end of their journey. Analysis was the enemy of such illusions, and offered the mind no release from its unceasing internal dialectic other then the one that death had already promised it.
