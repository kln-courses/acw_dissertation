<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEDICATION OF CALLIMACHUS (IG J2 609) (PLATES IO-II) Two inscriptions 1 commemorating the battle of Marathon and set up soon after 490 have come down to us. Both are epigrams and both have profited by recent discovery and research. The one, IG I2 763, has had its left-hand portion added by a fortunate find in the Agora,2 giving the beginnings of four hexameters: the other, IG 12 609, an inscribed column 3 formerly carrying a statue, has now, as a result of recent study, been reunited with the dedication it once bore, a winged woman, a Nike, it is thought. The group is one of the more spectacular fruits of the long-sustained and still continuing attempt to reunite the scattered pieces of the ' Perserschutt'. The reasons for dealing again with this latter dedication are new readings offered as a result of an examination of the inscription in the Epigraphical Museum in Athens.4 IG 12 609 is an inscription on a column of Pentelic marble of an estimated diameter of 0-32 m., roughly picked all round except for two flutings cut to receive two lines of inscription running vertically downwards. The fillet between the two flutings, of a width of 0-005 m., shows that the column was Ionic (PLATES IO-I I). The text of the inscription was restored by Hiller in IG 12 as follows: I [KatipaX6s &amp;v]ieEKEV 'Ap Svaios TE-rvaic a &amp;v[yEiov d]avdryrov, oi 'O[AmTI a 86'r'] rEXoov.

The column as preserved consists of eight fragments,5 four of which join into two pieces. Altogether, the position of five fragments relative to each other can be determined with certainty, because they either join or make up a 1 Apart from the abbreviations approved for general use in BSA, I quote J.

Finally, there is one floater (fragmentf). These fragments were found in the years between I84o and 1888, in an area east of the Erechtheum and the Parthenon, and were published, for the most part, separately and without knowledge of their pertinence to each other. All of them, with the exception of fragment c, had found their way into the first edition of the Corpus and its supplements,6 when in 1891 Lolling first assembled the eight pieces,7 and arranged them in their relation to each other. His attempts, however, to form a coherent text were only moderately successful, although with brilliant intuition he connected the dedication with Callimachus, the polemarch of 490, the Athenian Commander- in-Chief at the battle of Marathon. He took his clue from the fragmentary TrroA]6papXos and the demotic 'Api8vcalos. His text was as follows: [KacTAipaX6s P' aV]EOEKEV 'Aqtiva-o[s] TdaeEVaiat cav------- - - - d0e]av6rov 1oi 6[pav6v EopJv] EXo0yv [o1-rE0UiEvoS Trof]papXOS 'AOEvaiCov T6v d&amp;ySva - - - - - EEvovo - - - - tatoiv 'Aeevaiov P - - - - - It might seem odd that he, who had seen so much, should have failed to connect the dycov mentioned in the inscription with the battle of Marathon.

Fragment c: Kirchhoff (Lolling) SB Berlin 1888, 313 no. I. Fragment d: Pittakys, AE 1839, no. 335 and often, e.g. IG I 350 b. Fragment d was found together with fragment a of the Iphidike dedication (IG IP 487 = DAA 3 = Kirchner, Imagines no. 13) and was taken to be part of the same column, despite the great differences in appearance of the two stones. However, the odd chance that both fragments used a form of phi all but unique seemed to support the combination. For the form of phi with a horizontal bar see Wilhelm, AnzAkWien 1934, I15., id., AM XXIII (1898), 482, n. 2, and Raubitschek, OJh XXXI (i939), Beiblatt 28. Only three Attic stone inscriptions with this form of phi are known, viz. IG I2 487; 609 ; and Hesp II (1933) 372 no. I - DAA 258 (cf. Raubitschek loc. cit. against Jeffery, BSA XXXIX (1938/9) 91). There are, how- ever, a good number of graffiti with this form; cf. the following: Agora P 12,212, a graffito in a context suggesting a date in the first half of the sixth century: EO(ppov; Agora P 17,682, P 18,063, P i8,o66, three ostraka cast against Themistocles of the deme of Phrearrhioi, probably in 482. Agora P Io,275, ostrakon cast against Xanthippos, the son of Ariphron. Acropolis 1498 (Graef-Langlotz, Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen II, pl. 93). (I owe my knowledge of the Agora pieces to the kindness of Eugene Vanderpool, who will publish them with other ostraka and graffiti in Hesperia.) The majority of these examples date to near the turn of the century, when the character of Attic writing and spelling underwent considerable changes. There was a certain amount of confusion prevalent at the time, especially among the forms of circular letters (see also n. 17). The Agora collection of ostraka provides new examples of this phenomenon. 7 ADelt 1891, 74.</page><page sequence="3">142 B. B. SHEFTON connection not only by the difficult use of aycbv (see page 148 below), but also by the consideration that it was impossible that the Callimachus who died in the battle should have made a dedication in respect of that battle. He therefore formed the theory that the polemarch had made this dedication after and in celebration of his conduct of the Panathenaic games ('Aqrlvackov Trbv aywva) in 490. From this inscription and from other considerations Lolling concluded that previous to perhaps 487 B.c. one of the polemarch's functions had been the conduct of the Panathenaic Games, a duty we know to have been dis- charged later by the ten athlothetai (Aristotle 'Aewr 6o). After Lolling, however, editors without exception connected the inscription with the battle of Marathon. The difficulties which must have worried Lolling were either ignored or met in various ways. U. K6hler 8 was, apart from a suggestion by Kirchhoff in the apparatus to the supplement to IG I 153, no. 350, the first to advocate the restoration of MESov in the second line of the inscription, and thereby to refer the &amp;dycov to the battle of Marathon. He proposed to reconcile the text P' 10VeEKEV with what we know about the death of Callimachus from Herodotus 9 by suggesting that the polemarch's son had set up a statue of his father after the battle, thus making the son the subject of &amp;VEOEKEV. Although he had thus faced one difficulty, he did not attempt to show how the inscription could be restored, and therefore his view has had little influence, though it is found adopted in print as late as Berve's Miltiades.o0 Hiller's version, published in 1919 in a preparatory study for the Editio Minor of the Corpus, is the foundation of all subsequent treatment of the inscrip- tion. He hazarded a guess as to the nature of the dedication (iyyExos teav-rcov), and, by giving for the first time a restoration of the first line, he fixed its length, and made the restoration of the second line a thing worth attempting. I repeat Hiller's text, this time arranged in verses: [KaoXiiPaX65 P' d&amp;V]0EKEV 'Aqn8vaTos T-r~vaiatl iav[yEXov ,e]avarov, 'oi 'O[Ai'rr'ia 86ic"r'] Xooyv.

The dedication, in his view, had been made in Callimachus' life-time on an unknown occasion. The 8 Hermes XXXI (1896), 150. 9 VI, 114-. 10 Hermes, Einzelschriften 2 (1937), 87, n.

He also provided a plausible text for the epigrams. Nevertheless an examination of the column makes it impossible to believe that Hiller is right. The two flutings are worked in precisely the same fashion, making it virtually certain that they were cut on one and the same occasion. Again, as the flutings were surely prepared to receive two lines of inscription, there can be no doubt that the two lines were inscribed together, and this is confirmed by the fact that they are both engraved by the same distinctive hand. The puzzle which both Kohler and Hiller had sought to solve is genuine enough, for, as far as our evidence goes, adv~qrKEV always means the formal act of dedication, and not of vowing alone. There are many inscriptions, Attic and non-Attic, where a distinction is made between these two acts. 'A dedicated (~&amp;v~erKEv) me, B made the vow (r10ix-aro) ' is the formula found in such cases. Examples are IG 12 503; 684; 709 (better DAA 221), and the same formula is found in a modified form on Hieron's monument at Olympia, set up by Deinomenes (Pausanias VIII, 42, 9) 8Scpa 'cIpcov T-r68E o0 1EXapiacrTO rcals8i' 8a0iKE AsivoiS rwrpi s vyoipi luvpaKOaioV. We cannot, I think, restore this formula in our inscription, saying that Callimachus made the vow and that someone else dedicated the statue: but unless we can do so, no purpose is served by restoring, as some have done,13 [E0Xa6cIvos Vro7,]pcSpXoS at the beginning of the second line. If we take &amp;avwenKE literally, and we have no right to do otherwise in face of the evidence adduced, it follows that the dedication, and not only the vow, must have been made by Callimachus before his death. In other words, the dedication had no connection with the battle of Marathon. Yet what survives is enough to show that the whole epigram was inscribed after the battle and Callimachus' death. There can thus be only one conclusion, namely, that the epigram on the column was inscribed after the statue had already been dedicated, not only the second line, as Hiller thought, but the whole of the 12 In the second verse Hiller preferred 1ot 'O[Xuirria 86liaTr'] EXooiv to IPot 6[pav6v eOpov] EXoom, thus avoiding the hiatus. Homer always has the participial form 'O?,0prnwa Schbar' XoVTrES, but the indicative occurs in hymn. III, 445 and hymn. VII, 21. For the metrical problems in the first verse see Wilhelm, AnzAkWien 1934, 112. Proposed remedies have been correction into "rd~ivrlt or &amp;veTrK' 'Apqivatios. The first alternative is preferable. J. M. Cook suggests to me that the metrical difficulties might be due to the possibility that the first verse was taken over with very little change from an original dedicatory inscription in prose (see p. 142). This may have read: KahklpaX6s p' dvkOEKEvT -rd&amp;vaiat 'Aqi8vaTos. (Cf. Wilhelm, Beitrdge 6.) 13 K. Schmidt ap. Laudien, Griechische Inschriften etc. 52, and Meritt ap.

This assumption may also help to explain the unusual feature of the column, two flutings carved into an otherwise plain column.'4 The original dedicatory inscription must have stood on the base which supported the column. This is now lost, or at any rate has not yet been identified.15 The surviving epigram, added, as we now suggest, after Calli- machus' death, must be regarded as a special tribute to his heroism, and likely enough was displayed in this prominent form in reaction to Miltiades' claim. Further comment on this point will have to be reserved until the text of the epigram is established. After Hiller's restoration of the epigram for IG 12, there is only one more that we need mention, that by Wilhelm, published in 1934 in an articlel6 dealing with the then newly discovered Agora fragment of IG 12 763. Wilhelm adopted Hiller's restoration of the first line, but proposed a new text for the second. He pointed out that in fragmentf there was, after E2svovo, a trace of another letter in the break of the stone. The slanting stroke, barely visible on the photograph (PLATE II (a)), he took to be part of an alpha. He also urged that reference to Callimachus' death was required in the second line. The restoration 0&amp;vE took account of both his observations, and he adopted it into his text. Admittedly the stone gives an omikron and not a theta, but Wilhelm assumed that the engraver had omitted to cut the cross, which may have been added in paint. Many instances of similar omissions were collected by the master, who had for long been interested in the vagaries of the circular letters, particularly the theta and the phi. 17 Wilhelm's text was as follows: [KaXi~MiaX6s ..... K.T.A. av[yEov .... K.T. . [6&amp;s o-rrac -rroM]IPaPXos 'AOevaiov T-v dySvva rov M[8ov -rE K1a ]EA~VOV 0rvE So Eyap i] rratclV 'AOEvclov MCa[paeOvoS v &amp;7A~Crl &amp;a'vov]. Wilhelm's view was that the polemarch had made the vow shortly before falling in the engagement, and that the dedication was posthumously carried out by his relations, friends, or even the Demos. Wilhelm was right in taking, against Hiller, the two lines together, but he ignored the difficulty caused by avOierKEV. 14 See pp. 14o and 16o. is See pp. 146 and i60. An oinochoe by the Trophy Painter (Beazley, Attic Red-Figure Vase Painters, 7 19 no. 8) shows a column dedication on a base in two degrees. The inscription is on the upper base block. 16 AnzAkWien 1934, I1i ff. 17 For confusions between theta and phi see Wilhelm, ibid., I I5; add to his examples IG I2, 982, a precise parallel where the cross has been left out in the theta of 0cavE (Kirchhoff's varia lectio in IG I, 48-9, 477c is mistaken).

Kbhler's guess no longer requires discussion. The yyos dOav6rcov was considered by Hiller, the author of this brilliant conjecture, to be a Hermes rather than an Iris or a Nike, and this was accepted by Wilhelm. In I940, however, Raubitschek published his discovery,18 made in the course of his study of the Acropolis dedications, that one of the marbles on the Acropolis, a winged woman held to be a Nike19 (Acrop. 690), fitted into an Ionic capital which he himself had reconstructed from fragments.20 This capital in turn had the same diameter, where it would have joined the shaft, as the Ionic column bearing the epigram of Callimachus. Moreover, it was the only capital on the Acropolis which fitted this shaft. The column, in turn, was the only Ionic shaft to fit the capital.21 It was claimed then by Raubitschek that the &amp;yyEAos avCrrcov had been found. It was, after all, not a Hermes, but a Nike, to all appearances a private victory dedication to Athena vowed by the polemarch before or during the battle, and set up after the victory by his heirs. Is AJA XLIV ('94o), 53. Reports and discussions of the discovery had already in preceding years appeared in a number of periodicals (cf. the bibliography in DAA and Tod2, addendum to no. 13). Most of these publi- cations show a reconstruction of the whole dedication sketched by Raubitschek. 19 Payne and Young, pl. 120, 1-2; Schrader, Marmor- bildwerke, pl. 91/2 (text, 122 no. 77). 20 See Ziichner, AA i936, 327 ff. 21 This and no more is the evidence for the attribu- tion. No actual join is preserved, but there were not so many &amp;yyeAoi davdrrcov on the Acropolis, and the case for Raubitschek is certainly stronger than Jacoby (Hesp XIV (1945) 158 n. 8) implies. However, Raubitschek (AJA l.c.) takes as premise what he should set out to prove, when he says, ' Yet it is hard to under- stand why a general should promise before a battle to dedicate to the goddess Athena a statue of Hermes. It would obviously be more likely for Callimachus to promise to dedicate, in case of victory, a statue of Nike.' (Italics are mine.) I am in any case doubtful whether a general would have dedicated as a private dedication a Nike after a battle. Callimachus was no Gelon (cf. Tod 17 and commentary). Moreover, since I believe that the dedication of the statue was unconnected with the battle, I consider Hampe's attractive suggestion (Die Antike XV (I939), 170) that the Pan-headed kerykeion from the Acropolis (de Ridder, Bronzes trouvis sur l'Acropole d' Athines, no. 4o9, fig. 83; Die Antike XV (1939), 172 fig. 3, 4; cf. also F. Crome, AM LXIII/IV (I938/9) 120o, no. I1) belongs to the statue unlikely to be true. I should like to think of the statue as an Iris rather than a Nike (cf. however n. 25a), but one cannot be confident. Nike is not in literature called &amp;yyEAos deavdrrcv, nevertheless she is one (cf. Roscher III, 307, and above all the pelikai Berlin 2166 and 2167 (Argos Painter, Beazley, Attic Red-Figure Vase Painters, 176, 5 and 6; AZ 1875 pl. to) where Nike, so called in the adscription, holds a kerykeion. They enable us to give the name Nike to some other unnamed figures holding L the kerykeion; e.g. a fpelike Cab. M6d. 392 by the Providence Painter, Beazley, op. cit., 433, 38). Cf. also Mayer in Roscher II, 354, s.v. ' Iris', who had already collected the evidence quoted here. Against Jacoby's insistence that the &amp;yyENos &amp;rav ~cv must be Hermes, as Hiller had thought, weighs the fact that the dedication of a Hermes to Athena would be difficult to explain (Cf., however, IG IV 1588, 1 o, the inventory of the temple of Damia and Auxesia in Aegina, for the dedication of a Dionysus in another deity's shrine). Moreover, anthropomorphic statues of Hermes, showing him as ryyeos doadrrcov, are unknown at this period, although vase-painters depict him fre- quently in this, his epic (post-Iliad), role. He also occurs so in relief sculpture, e.g. Acrop. 702, Hermes and the Aglaurids, because there, as in vase-painting and other narrative arts, he was represented as part of a story. In the round, as a single image, he is at this time best known as the Arcadian iKptod6pos (cf. Roscher I, 2394 ff.; Nilsson, Geschichte d. griech. Religion I, 476). The earliest appearance in substantive sculpture of the &amp;yybhos ~Oav6rcav known to me is the Arcadian 13219; AE 1904, pl. 9; Lamb, Bronzes 153 and pl. 57b, dated by her in the second quarter of the fifth century). Later, in the middle of the century and beyond, come the mid-Phidian Hermes Ludovisi, the sitting Hermes from the Acropolis (Acrop. I346; AM XXXVII (1912), pl. 13), and the Polyclitan statue. All these examples are much later than the Persian wars; they represent a new conception of free sculpture. Such early dedications to Hermes from Attica as have come down to us appear to have taken the form of herms, cf. DAA 326 (and commentary) and p. 500, also Schrader, Antike Plastik, Festschrift Amelung 227 ff. From Samos we know of a greater than life-size statue of Hermes carved perhaps in the last quarter of the sixth century; but only the foot remains (Buschor, Altsamische Standbilder 51, figs. I86-188), cf., however, Rumpf's doubts in AA 1935, 394 f. Nothing useful is known about the appearance of the Hermes Agoraios, roughly contemporary with the Callimachus dedication (Overbeck, Schriftquellen, nos. 470-474).</page><page sequence="7">146 B. B. SHEFTON The marble ' Nike' (or Iris, for from what survives it is impossible to tell which it was) had previously been dated on stylistic grounds to about 490 B.C. Now confirmation of the date seemed to have been afforded, and an important late archaic dedicatory group could be restored to something like the form it had when it was set up on the Acropolis shortly after 490, only to be destroyed by the Persian invader less than ten years later. Raubitschek's conclusion as to the date and circumstances of the dedication was based on Wilhelm's restoration and interpretation of the text, which, as we have seen, does not deal fully with all the problems presented by the surviving text of the inscription. In fact, as it is now realized that the statue had been dedicated before Marathon, the sculpture still remains undated, except on grounds of style. All we can say is that it will have been carved before 490. There remains the difficulty, if so we call it, of explaining how Callimachus came to dedicate so exceptional a statue on the Acropolis. We can give no answer to this question. The epigram gives no reason for the dedication; the emphasis there is on the second line extolling the dedicant. A reason for the dedication will have been given on the base with the original dedicatory inscription. In the absence of that inscription it is useless to guess what the occasion of such an offering may have been.21a II Ever since Kohler editors have been at one in reading rb6v dyava arbv MESov. Hiller completed the restoration with his MS0ov TSr KcX IEA~EvOV. Yet for an Athenian to call the battle of Marathon simply ' the contest between Medes and Greeks' is strange. In fact, we have evidence that the Athenians were acutely aware that, though the enemy was threatening not only themselves but the whole of Greece, they (and the Plataeans) alone had stood in her defence.22 Whereas the restoration and interpretation of EAtvov seems fairly secure, that of MEiov is not. An examination of the stone reveals that the fragmentary letter in the break after the mu was an alpha and not an epsilon. This seems to me quite certain. Measurement of the letters in the inscription shows that the angle formed by the upright hasta and the top horizontal bar of the epsilon ranges from 65' to 750. The angle formed by the hasta and the sloping bar of the alpha, on the other hand, varies from 40o to 520. The relevant angle of the doubtful letter is 480. An alpha may therefore be read with assurance, especially as enough of the downward-sloping bar survives to show the angle clearly (see PLATE II(b)). If there is no epsilon on the stone, Trv M~ov rTE Kci VE\EVOV cannot have 21a See n. 25". 22 See p. I49.</page><page sequence="8">THE DEDICATION OF CALLIMACHUS (IG 12 609) 147 stood on it, and we must begin again the task of restoring the epigram. Before that, however, a few words on how the epsilon crept into the accepted text. Lolling, in ADelt 189 I1, pl. A2, published a line drawing of the whole inscrip- tion, giving the critical letters as M . It was the first time that the last letter of the fragment had been read and Lolling obviously thought that it was an epsilon, as he shows in his transcript, op. cit. 81. He was, however, conscienti- ous enough to indicate that the stone gave only the hasta and two bars, the upper and the middle. In fact, the break runs just where the middle bar would be, making identification difficult. With the traces as given in Lolling's line drawing it would be hard to decide whether the letter had been an epsilon or an alpha. We need not imagine that Lolling saw more of the edge of frag- ment e than is now preserved, because, though his drawing is good, it is not free from inaccuracies. To mention only one, the one most relevant perhaps, on the same edge of fragment e, in the first fluting, he shows only \, whereas the stone quite clearly preserves N, i.e. a nu or a mu or a gamma. In his text, indeed, Lolling says that the letter in question is probably a nu, but it is his drawing that is now on trial. There are also a number of other inaccuracies which a comparison of the line drawing with our photographs will reveal. Too much importance, therefore, need not be attached to the witness of Lolling on this point.23 Of later editors none but Hiller and Wilhelm had any first-hand acquain- tance with the stone, or even with a squeeze. Kirchhoff copies Lolling, and Kohler in his turn thought that he reproduced Lolling and Kirchhoff. In fact, he reproduced neither the one nor the other, and by printing the relevant letter as O he threw away caution and accuracy. The epsilon, and with it the restoration M8Sov, had now established itself, and seemed confirmed when Hiller later found that the mysterious EAEvovo (fragment f) resolved itself into ]EN (N) vov. III Our own restoration will be governed by the observation that the spacing of letters in the second fluting is slightly closer than in the first. This is particularly noticeable in fragment f. The writing is too irregular and the continuously intact surface too small to make precise measurement practicable. It may be observed, however, that if we count the number of letters between two points, where letters in the two lines happen to coincide in position, one alongside the other, we find that line 2 gains one letter approximately every 23 There appears to have been subsequent damage to the edge of fragment c. Lolling still gives the final sigma of roMupapXos, which is now lost. The squeeze and photograph of the Berlin Academy also had the letter. But Kirchner's photograph in his Imagines shows the present state of the stone.</page><page sequence="9">148 B. B. SHEFTON eighteen places of the first line. Thus, in the first line, between the phi of 'Apip8vatos and the alpha of avyExov there are eighteen letters inclusive, whereas there are nineteen inclusive between the epsilon of 'AOEvalov and the mu of tia[. in line 2. We must note, however, that the punctuation mark in the first line must not be counted as one letter, as it does not take up a letter-space. For all we know, it may have been put in after the line had been engraved. The distance between the iota and the alpha, between which the punctuation is placed, is one centimetre, the distance between iota and alpha elsewhere in the same line. In the second line, however, a definite space is allotted to the punctuation, which should therefore be counted as one letter-space. The reason for this discrepancy is that in the second line the engraver could not follow the practice of squeezing the punctuation marks between letters without displacing them. Alpha and tau do not lend themselves to this practice, but no such difficulty existed between iota and alpha in line I. For the first line I accept Hiller's restoration. This fixes the number of letters to be supplied in the gaps of line 2, which, following Wilhelm, I begin as follows: 6bS(a)rMEaCS Trro7,]paPXO[S] 'AOEvaiov "r6v dyyva I have no doubt that the line began with a relative pronoun. The alternative, a participle depending upon &amp;vEOrlKEv, is unacceptable not only because of its position, so far removed from the main verb, with a relative clause in between, but also because it would imply that the dedication was made in circumstances to be described in this line. It has, however, been shown that that is not so, at any rate if the commonly accepted connection of this line with the battle of Marathon is to be upheld. If '6s is accepted, then ar~caas naturally suggests itself to complete the phrase crraiat -rbv dc/ova, to ' set up the agon '.24 The use of the word &amp;yc'v here seems extraordinary. It rightly troubled Lolling, though none of his successors. In Homer the word means assembly.or place of assembly. In the meaning of ' games ' or ' contest' it does not seem to occur before hymn. I, 150 and hymn. VI, 19. From then on it kept this as its main meaning, e.g. Simon. 21 (Io), Diehl. See also OJh XXXI (I939), Beiblatt 30, IX = DAA 327 and DAA 326 for this use in second quarter of the sixth century. The tragedians extended its sense to include 'struggle ', e.g. Aesch. Choeph. 584, 729, and prose writers then took it over for war and battle. There can be little doubt, then, that dydov in our epigram would, at first reading, have been taken to mean 'games'; only as an unusual metaphor 24 I write 1i- (cr)-raas, since the form I]EX(A),vov in verse 4 shows that gemination of consonants did not occur in this inscription; hence also Kacrh(A)fpaXos.</page><page sequence="10">THE DEDICATION OF CALLIMACHUS (IG I2 609) 149 could it have signified' battle '." I can think of no reason why the poet should have used this word, except, perhaps, in reference to the lost original dedica- tory inscription. In that case the point escapes us now.2- The unusual significance of&amp;aycov obliges us, I think, to fill the ten (not nine!) spaces in the lacuna that follows with: "r6v Ma[paOevt "rp6 "]EA~vov T-rv ayova -r6v Mapaevit unqualified could hardly have referred to the battle of Marathon (even granted that Callimachus' achievement was common knowledge), seeing that there were games celebrated there in honour of Herakles (Schol. ad Pind., Olymp. IX, 134, ed. Drachmann I, 298; cf. also the inscription published by Vanderpool, Hesp XI (1942), 344 ff. = SEG X, no. 2). We must have then 'who set up the agon, the one that took place at Marathon to protect the Greeks ', to give a tolerably satisfactory sense to the passage. The use ofrrp6 for 'on behalf of' is as old as Homer, derived, as it is, from 'in front of'. The hiatus is legitimate, though not easy (cf. Maas, Griechische Metrik, paragraphs 121, 141). -rwp6 'AXatcLv occurs twice in Homer (II. IV, 156, and X, 286; cf. also IV, 382 rwp6 68'o for the hiatus) in the same meaning, though the hiatus there.is in a different metrical position. The sentiment expressed in this part of our epigram reminds us of: 26 'EXXijvcoV "-rpolpacXovT-rEs 'Aivacioi MapaO$vti Xpvao'6poov Mil8sov corr6poav 8iivapi.v. The date of this is not certain,27 but we know that the same view of Athens' role was expressed in the first of the Marathon epigrams (IG J2 763), which certainly were composed and inscribed before 480.28 The restoration of the remainder of the epigram presents grave difficulties. After 7EEvov we have on the stone o0 which Wilhelm wanted to make into e&amp;ve. This is not impossible, but is a counsel of despair. His insistence that the epigram must have contained a reference to Callimachus' death does not strike me as cogent,29 if he meant totidem verbis, and I prefer to complete the word to read 6v[opa in the sense of reputation and glory. 25 This is, I think, confirmed by the valuable evidence of an oracle given sometime in the nineties or eighties of the fifth century, and reported by Herodotus (IX, 33; cf. also Paus.

B. SHEFTON The last preserved letters of the inscription are MtI. Here, too, we can now be certain what the fragmentary letter was. The possibility of either alpha or nu has been generally admitted. An alpha has, however, been restored by all recent editors, as the restoration Ma[paeovos invited itself there, since the place where we have restored Ma[paeovi was taken by M[S8ov. As a matter of fact, it is highly unlikely that the letter was an alpha. The height of the uprights of the alphas in the inscription ranges from 2-5 to 2-7 cms. with one upright of 2-4 cms., those of the nus from 2-o to 2-2 cms. with one upright of 2-4 cms. The height of the stroke of the letter under consideration is 2-2 cms. It is therefore almost certainly a nu.30 A reference to Marathon is therefore not indicated here, which, incidentally, makes the restoration of Ma[pa6vti where we have given it more probable. The tiv is easily completed into pvipriq or pv~ipa and the subjects of the end of the epigram are then 6vopa and pvlp-l-and suitable ones they are. These two themes were often treated in combination in sixth- and fifth-century epigrams, usually in the formula 'A gave glory to his city on the one hand, and took renown or arete for himself on the other'. Compare the following examples of the use of this formula. (i) From the dedication of Mandrokles in the Heraion at Samos (Herod. IV, 88): aICrrti pv -rpcavov TrEptieEi, a0ioat SE K8oS,. .. (ii) From the epigram engraved under the casualty-list of 440-439 (IG J2 943 = Geffcken 86 = Hiller 52 = Tod 48): acymipav 8' E0KXneaai rr warpiSra, acrois 8' &amp;Odvoarov Cgvp' &amp;pers 9SEos'av.3 A different, though in some ways parallel, treatment is found in the epigram over the Corinthian grave on Salamis said only [6 O EOiBSp]6V TrOKx' valoPES &amp;orvu Kopiv8O [vOv 8' Iap A a]vros [vxaos 'EXat ahapis] (IG I' 927 = Geffcken 96 = Hiller 20 = Tod I6 = Diehl 90 (96)), and nothing about the couplet ivedBs (olvi'aaas viias Kal I'TMpaoS VTErg Kai M1Bouvs klp&amp;v 'EAAd8a pvU6pe8a of the later tradition,' Das Gedicht als solches istfertig mit der Erkldrung " Wir sind Korinther und liegen auf Salamis ".

It was assumed, no doubt rightly, that the fate of the Athenian Commander-in-Chief would be known to everyone likely to read the inscription. 30 I owe this observation to advice kindly given me by Professor H. T. Wade-Gery. 31 acrrois here stands for aTrrois. For use of the per- sonal pronoun as reflexive in archaic literature, see Wackernagel, Vorlesungen iiber Syntax II2, 89; cf. Buck, Dialects 91/2; also IG V. I, 213 passim for examples in fifth-century Laconia (I owe the references to K. Dover). Note also that there is assimilation in lines 2 and 3, but none in line 4 (&amp;eva-rov pvilia). This shows how dangerous it is to argue from one part of an inscription to another; cf. e.g. IG 12 945, 5 (Potidaea epigram) and the comments inJHS LIII (933) 78 n. 24 and Hesp XII (1943) 22 n. 44.

Finally, we find the same formula used to express a somewhat different contrast in Thucydides II, 43, 2: KOlVg yap acr Ga-rac 5186VTES i t V a. V -nralvov tAapPavov.... There was tradition behind those words of Pericles. I doubt whether in our epigram we can restore the contrast between what Callimachus did for his city, and what fate he met himself, in quite the same juxtaposition as we have found it in the examples just quoted. There are, however, also examples in the fifth century where this contrast is softened, as, for instance, in the last of the Potidaea epigrams (IG 12 945 = Geffcken 87 = Hiller 53 - Tod 59; cf. Hesp XII (1943), 19): qcuvXas 8' avrippo[rr]cX GOvreS E[NA]&amp;aXaav-' apETE Kati rra-[pi8'] EOK4]e aav (cf. also IG J2 Io85, 4 = Hiller 50 = Tod 41). Taking our own epigram again, it seems to me that in the lacuna at the end of the penultimate verse a verb is undoubtedly required. If we fill it merely with an epithet to 6vopa we shall have to leave the verb right to the end of the last line, an arrangement which will make the epigram hard to grasp. This consideration makes impossible a restoration on the lines of the Simonidean encomium on the dead of Thermopylae,32 such as: v[o.' arrov aiEi ] ratcoiv 'A0Evaiov, v[EV T apET-r KOTTEWTEVrv. This version also has the disadvantage of taking the dative nTaiCiv 'AOEvaiov with KCrTiErTEV of the last verse. In fact, we do not find that the people to whom the fallen citizen leaves the memory of his arete are defined; certainly no dedication would limit the extent of a man's future renown. There is, therefore, a presumption that rratliv depends upon a verb in the previous verse, and if that is so we shall do well to use the caesura in the last verse to start a new sentence, set off against the rest of the epigram by 8E. This would 32 Diehl 5 (4). Dr. R. Pfeiffer and Miss V. Newnham kindly inform me that Wilamowitz' rearrangement in the last two lines cannot stand (Sappho und Simonides 140, n. 3).

But none of these changes can be justified by any other reason (grammar, style), so one had better leave the text as it is with the remark that for metrical reasons the text of lines 4/5-8/9 is doubtful' (Pfeiffer).

'(who, setting up, as polemarch of the Athenians, the fight that took place at Marathon on behalf of the Greeks,) brought renown upon the children of the Athenians, and left behind the memory of his arete '. I have restored thirteen letters in the penultimate verse in accordance with the principle outlined above. In order to obtain this number of letters I am obliged to assume that 'OAtirtcia 86cpacra EXoowV is spelt out in the first line without elision.33 This assumption appears to be supported by the fact that there is a ledge preserved to the left of EXoyiv on fragment g, 1-8 cms. long and 0o7 cm. high, with no letter parts showing. It is difficult to account for this on any assumption other than that there was an alpha to the left of ENXOmV, the return-stroke of which ended just above the level still preserved. The thirteen letters do not include the verse separation marks, which I believe to have taken up no letter space, as their position between nu and pi is analogous to the position of these marks in line I rather than in line 2.34 IV ['Is(oaricras rro]a]paPXo[S] 'A0Evaciov T-v dyova Trv Ma[pao0vt rrp6 '"]E?'vov, 6v[ot1' a-rresdp&amp;vosv i] arrctivv 'AeEvaiov" iyv[~yEV 8' &amp;pESs KCTEXErr1TEV].

This occurs in extant literature only 33 See Meisterhans-Schwyzer, Grammatik d. att. Inschr., 69/70. Elision, where required by the verse, is often expressed and not expressed in the same epigram.

But the passive surely presupposes an active, of which the chance of survival has preserved no instance.

The phrase is common in epigrams and elsewhere in the late sixth and early fifth century (later examples seem to copy earlier usage, as IG I2 945, the Potidaea epigrams). Cf. Herod.

Similar is the Mi'cov wrraicv of the Eion epigrams (see n. 46). 3. ViEV prETvS. vTii.pt occurs very much more frequently than wviwLrl in epigrams and other commemorative inscriptions, and the verb used in connec- tion with it is TritI or one of its compounds.35 Only rarely is another verb found, and then there is usually occasion for comment. The almost exclusive use of Trierpt is explained by the fact that ivijia in epigrams of the archaic period as well as of the fifth century means the concrete 'reminder', the monument, whatever its shape might be, which carries the inscription, whether it be the casualty-list over the grave with its epitaph, or a discus, or an altar, a herm, or the statue and its base.36 There is one epigram which at first sight might seem to be an exception to this rule. It is preserved in the Anthology, and is now almost universally accepted as having once stood on the Eurymedon casualty-list (A.P.

SHEFTON pviipa could plausibly be translated here as ' memory', particularly since it is used with ?ET-rrEIv instead of 0rTival. But there can be no doubt that ' memorial' or ' monument' is the correct translation, and that the memorial meant is the casualty-list itself. This interpretation gives point to qGI.iEvoI, a word that would otherwise be superfluous after the first line. What the poet wanted us to know is that through their death in battle these citizens had left behind, in the casualty-list over the public grave, a memorial more honourable and glorious (K&amp;AMcrrov) than any vwna of their arete that they could possibly have dedicated or obtained in any other way. The sentiment behind this will be discussed later. At this stage, though, it will be well to recall that a strong case has recently been made that the Eurymedon dead were, with one exception, the first war casualties to be publicly buried in the Kerameikos cemetery.37 Also, the practice of erecting a casualty-list over the common grave had not been universal. This was, therefore, a fitting occasion for the poet to state briefly but pointedly the peculiar honour which their sacrifice had won for those buried here. We find, then, that plvicpa in archaic and fifth-century epigrams invariably refers to the concrete monument.38 We can be almost equally definite about 37 Jacoby, JHS LXIV (1944), especially 48 and 52. 38 The possible exception is the first of the Potidaea epigrams, which appears in IG I2 945 (= Hiller 53 Tod 59) as: oi ivops &amp;pET TE] VIKEV E&amp;iMh6Epop vip' ?apov [a]q [Erpas]. 'They took victory as their v-iapa d&amp;prfis.' This bold transference of viKr into something concrete is paralleled by the contemporary passage in Pericles' Funeral Speech (Thuc. II, 43, 2 and 3) : .... XappavoV KaGI TbOV T rapov iTlarTpTaTrrov, OKi Lv C KEiVT'GI pAA&amp;ov, &amp;A?"' iv &lt;b fi 66a aTrrCv rrapdcx TrC iVTUX6OVTT ald Kai X6you Kai Epyov KalpC aEGipVlOrTOS KcTraEirrETat. &amp;vip(v y&amp;p imTcpavcv ~rr&amp;aa yi -r r(o0, Kai o'r o Trr v lp6vov iv -r- OiKEg f TaipaiVE rintypaqnild, 6&amp;X Kcai V "r pph IrpoarlKov &amp;ypaqos pvgpT irrcp' IKAK6orTCP T?-S i yvcbS pa.OV TOi. ipyou Ev5ItalTXrat. The whole earth is their grave, because their 'mem- orial' is not only the casualty-list with its epitaph at home in the Kerameikos, but even abroad, where there is no inscribed monument, the unwritten memory imprinted in the mind of each individual lives (to form the 'reminder'). (The last -roo Epyou in the passage means' monument'; cf. Raubitschek, REA XLI (1939) 2 17 ff. on the meaning of Epya in the preamble of Hero- dotus.) In the Potidaea epigram it is the viKTl Erdb6hTpoS, in the Funeral Speech the &amp;ypaqyos pvilrl -rfis yvcb'prl which forms the pvfiia of the fallen. In both cases the strict meaning of pvfipa has been widened in an unusual application of the word, and, in the case of the Potidaea epigram, of a whole formula (see p. 157). There is no evidence, however, for such an extension in the use of the word before the late thirties of the century, and, in fact, the two examples just mentioned may not be entirely unconnected with each other. (The evidence from the Potidaea epigram is not secure, as so much of the text has been restored: aqtpas of the Corpus cannot stand, as an examination of the stone shows. Meritt ap. Raubitschek, Hesp. XII (I943), 22 reports seeing traces of phi and theta to be completed to o01fivoi following an earlier restoration by J. U. Powell. When I examined the stone in unfavourable light conditions I could not be positive about these two letters, although an examination of the squeeze tends to confirm Meritt. The adoption of PpevoI need not cause any other changes in the text of the Corpus, although it removes one of the arguments for it.) This absence of earlier examples makes it, in my opinion, impossible to restore the last two lines of our epigram to something like this: OV[op' qirTOv adEi] Trartiv 'A0evaiov pv[ip' pETESr rrIEv]. 'who left immortal renown for the children of the Athenians, to be the monument of his arete '. The form of the epigram, a number of hexameters followed by a pentameter, would have a contemporary parallel, if Wilamowitz is right in his view of the original form of the epigram (Plut. Aristid. 19, de malign. Herod. 42 (873 b), Hiller 26 = Diehl 1o7 (140)) on the altar of Zeus Eleutherios at Plataea (Sappho und Simonides 197. Cf., however, Jacoby, Hesp XIV (ix945) 185, n. 107. For the date, see Hiller l.c. against Wilamowitz op. cit. 188/9. CJ. also Wade-Gery in JHS LIII (1933) 73, n. 7 and 91, n. 86). The content, however, of this restoration I believe to have been impossible for the time of the Persian wars, because I do not believe that pvtupa would then have been used as an attribute of vopa or 86 I also doubt whether Bowra is justified (Greek Lyric Poetry, 366) in quoting the Thucydides passage just cited as parallel</page><page sequence="16">THE DEDICATION OF CALLIMACHUS (IG 12 609) 155 the meaning of pvt1r, which in archaic and fifth-century epigrams always means ' memory', and never ' monument'. This, no doubt, explains the rarity of the word in epigrams, where we so often find pvfivi There may be one exception to this statement, which Nachmanson 39 found when looking for cases where ivilwi was equivalent to iviiva. All his examples are late, except for an epigram from Tanagra, on a poros block, in epichoric script,-an interesting witness to archaic and knightly virtues-published by Dittenberger as IG VII, 350o, from Lolling's copy: [TToTahis] &amp;[v5]p[i qipot] N N///NI PI, eav6[VTI] M[avrTi~ot] XOEviav -rrovTvoV TE aocTip. For the letters in capitals Dittenberger read orrT]cav, but admitted in his apparatus that p]v[dp]cav would correspond better with Lolling's copy 'sed id sic usurpari posse pra Pvapa vel pvct aEov non puto '. Nachmanson did not share Dittenberger's doubts, and adopted pvacxav as the true reading. The stone requires re-examination, and pending that we must suspend judgment. After these findings 40 we are bound to restore tviVEv in our epigram, a word which is recommended by the ease with which it fits into the metre. Mvipa, on the other hand, would, to my mind, be quite unsuitable here. If our view is correct, that the dedication was unconnected with Marathon and Callimachus' victory, then there can be no question of the statue being a lvfipal &amp;pE-riS of the polemarch. But even if it had been vowed by Callimachus during or immediately before the battle, and set up after his death, pvip' xpErs could not have stood, for we may be certain that Callimachus, whilst alive, did not vow or dedicate a vqii'a papETiS for himself, in the way in which, for instance, Pausanias set up one for himself on the Bosporus at a time when his hybris was already apparent. Mvipaara &amp;pT-ris set up by individuals to celebrate their own arete are rare and essentially foreign to the ethics of the Greek brought up in a city state. His arete is not an inherited quality, as was that of an earlier aristocratic age, but had to be won by toil and effort, and even then it was for the fellow- citizens to say that it had been won. The examples of a pvqfi" &amp;dpE-rfis set up by the honorands themselves are clearly the exceptions, and are symptomatic of a conscious repudiation of the good-citizenship ideal. They display hybris for the Simonidean encomium on the fallen at Thermo- pylae (Diehl 5 (4), 6): 6 81 aflKO' OlKETV EsC8ogfav 'ETAX&amp;SoS E Sro.

Cf. also AJP XLVIII (1927), 18-19. Hesychius identifies pvirnq with vrlp6au- vov and is therefore thinking of later usage. One strange use of pvvi~j in earlier literature occurs in Theognis I 2, a section without the Kyrnos seal: pvyjiSa 8' EXovU' dyaDOrv Kcai X6pv ~orriaco.

Whatever Pausanias and his poet meant by arete in this epigram, it will not have excluded the aristocratic notion. The dedication at Delphi,42 which was promptly erased by the Spartan authorities, was a personal ivfipc dperfis (even though the word arete does not occur in the poem by Simonides). The dedication was intolerable for that reason as much as for any other.43 Much the same may be said about another monument.

We know nothing about Praxiteles except what we learn from the inscrip- tion. Uprooted from his home, presumably in the service of the Syracusan tyrant, he now feels the need to assert his ancient nobility.

Quite different from this is the arete of which we hear in fifth-century Attic public epitaphs.

There is no evidence either way, as we do not know what stood on the top of the base. But even if he was, the epigram would still be extraordinary. 45 Important discussions on arete and the change in its content are to be found in Wilamowitz' commentary on the Skopas skolion of Simonides (Sappho und Simonides '73/4 and 176/7 with notes; see also Aristoteles und Athen II, 406 ff.) and in Jaeger's interpretation of Tyrtaeus frag. 9 Diehl (SB Berlin 1932, 537 if.; cf. also P. Friedlinder, AJP LXIII (1942) 78). The Simonides poem cannot, I think, form the basis of an estimate of the new meaning of arete in the city state, since it abandons rather than reinterprets the word arete. Jaeger's attempt, however, to connect the revaluation in Sparta with a definite historical situ- ation, and his view that Tyrtaeus first gave expression to this changed view, seems to me to be most valuable.

An interesting illustration of this change in ethos and the content of arete is provided by surviving epitaphs and honorary decrees.

In other words, the generals were not allowed to dedicate a pvfipa &amp;drfis in their own honour, apparently an illustration of the point argued in our text. The epigrams are preserved by Aeschines, Plutarch, and Tzetzes (ad Lycophr. Cass. 417; cf. Hiller 34 and the discussions by Wade-Gery, JHS LIII (I933) 71 ff.; Jacoby, Hesp XIV (1945) 185 if. Cf. also Gomme, CR LXII (1948) 5). They show clearly that in fact the dedication was made not by the generals, but by the Demos. This was so clear that Aeschines, in order to be able to draw his moral (cf. Jacoby l.c.), had to add to the prohibition of mentioning the names the entirely separate and incredible condition that the dedi- catory inscription had to make it appear that the Demos had set up the herms. With this nonsense the whole context of the epigrams, as given in our literary sources, collapses, however plausible this or that element in it may be, and they cease to be of any relevance to this discussion.</page><page sequence="19">158 B. B. SHEFTON called the dedication his uvfiia- 'pET-rfi. So much has emerged from the discussion. Moreover, whoever gave the instructions, after Callimachus' death, to add the epigram on the column of the dedication standing already on the Acropolis (and there is no evidence who it was) could well have said that Callimachus had left behind the ' memory' of his arete, but never, I believe, that he left a ' memorial' of it. Such memorials in truth did exist at Mara- thon and in the city, but the uviT7hic mentioned in the epigram would have referred to this, the statue dedicated by Callimachus himself."' 4. KcrE',EInTEv. The aorist is the normal tense found in classical epigrams, in keeping with their tendency to avoid generalities and sentimentality, and their desire to describe simply the event which occasioned the composition of the poem. Deeds were allowed to speak for themselves. The present tense occurs only when the dead are either speaking or being spoken to, or where the relation to the dead of something now existing is described. The latter category has certain well-defined formulas, such as occur in: 6v Ovaorro[s 8aKpu]6ES KacO[E]XEI (IG 12 987 = Geffcken 42) and [vU'v 8' FcPi A'ia]vTros [vacos iXE l"XhaXapCS] (IG 12 927 = Geffcken 96 = Hiller 20 = Tod 16), or in another way in ~ilpar TCrov oCaXE OEaoTr&amp;daS Eip)Xopos (Steph.

Apart, however, from these reflections on the present state of the dead, and the vividness of the personal address, the attention of the classical epigram is rigorously concentrated upon the past event which is praised, or the occasion of the epigram, and nothing is allowed to distract the gaze from the past. Therefore I find it difficult to believe that the ' Simonidean ' epigram on the fallen at Plhtaea is contemporary48 (A.P. VII, 251 = Geffcken i i = Diehl 121 (99)): "A3pEUTrov KAhES 0E (pR1)h TrEp TTrarpiit O~VTES KUVVEOV OavCrTOU aIp(EdAXoVTO VipOS' 086 -rEevaol ocav6v-rEs, Er'ei oUp' apErTi KaO0TrpepE KU8iVOUO" &amp;Vay0E 8 cjorros E 'AiiECo. 47 Nor could a statue dedicated on some other occasion have become a pvi~pa perfTs after Callimachus' death, for the formula ' he gave glory to his city and took virtue for himself' refers to one and the same action. 48 Cf. Bowra, Early Greek Elegists, 196, against Geffcken.</page><page sequence="20">THE DEDICATION OF CALLIMACHUS (IG J2 609) 159 The use of the present here goes well beyond the limited reflections upon the present state of the dead which we have just considered; and it describes, not a state of the dead or a relation to them, but an action which affects them; it is thus different from statements such as 3cobv 8i pO~i v rr,-rat K\EOS in the Aeschylean epigram A.P. VII, 255, or the first line of the Marathon epigrams, which has been restored by Wilhelm as: av6pov Tv8O ' - pETE[S CaIq)ElI KAO 0 &amp;(pTOV]C(1Ei. The epigram A.P. VII, 251 is thus not acceptable as an early fifth-century composition. Mv 8' 5 pET9S KcrraEi'TrEl, similarly, would, in my view, not be a suitable restoration in the Callimachus epigram. It would describe present activity of the dead rather than his action in the past, the occasion of the epigram.49 Our choice of tense, then, lies between the aorist and imperfect. I-adopt the imperfect for metrical reasons. For the use of the tense Kenneth Dover refers me to Iliad II, 107, and Wackernagel's comments on the passage in his Vorlesungen iiber Syntax 12, 182/3. In the Iliad passage AEiTrrE is equivalent to EAItrE, as the previous line shows. Wackernagel takes the view that the semantic distinction between imperfect and aorist does not invariably hold, and that certain verbs, e.g. EKYAEVE = EKEEUE, more often than not, normally or commonly use the imperfect for the aorist. It may well be that (KcTa)AEiTrWE comes, as Dover thinks, into this category. It must be admitted, after all, that the last two words of the epigram, uncontrolled as they are by any knowledge of the number of letters to be restored, admit of several alternatives, between which we cannot finally decide; nor does it matter greatly, because the sense is secure, depending, as it does, upon PV~IEv, which carries with it AEiTTEIV or a verb very close in meaning. Whether the epigram ended with Kcrr~TElErEV or even pviv aPET-ris Kac-TEhrwov we cannot say. Here is the whole of the epigram set out with our restorations: 50 [Kch(A) ipaX6S '' aV]E0EKEV 'Apivciao[s] T&amp;eEvaia"li av [yEXov &amp;e]av&amp;rov 'ol 'O[Ar 86'paTa] EXomlV, 49 These observations do not apply to the use of the present participle, which is often governed by the fact that the aorist participle would imply that the action of the participle took place before that of the main verb. This is shown, for example, in the epigram (Hiller 30 = Tod 20): 'EAAdt8 Kcii MeyapEOawv AAE\jiEpov &amp;pap d&amp;itv 1lpEvo 0eava-rov poipav i6&amp;Ed(Ep0a, where the straining after the goal and the doom occurred together. 60 As an alternative I ought to give, perhaps, the following version, which has the advantage of avoiding the hiatus and the possibly rather forced construction of ia-rP&amp;Evoaev : [Cbs(a)TiCas w oM] papxo[s] 'A0Evalov T-rO &amp;yjv -r6v Ma[pcA56v, wav1]EX(A)kvov 6v[op-' ~-rsarvoa:v i] -rrataiv 'Aevaciov IIv[qPv pETrS KaTrXAEITTOV].

V The height of the column which carried the statue dedicated by Calli- machus on the Acropolis can be estimated to have been, together with its base and capital, about two and a half metres.51 The epigram which survives, and which was engraved along the length of the column, was therefore at a convenient level for the spectator to read. Moreover, the unique feature of the column, namely the two flutings cut into an otherwise plain shaft, must have aroused his attention just as much as it does today. There were numer- ous column dedications on the Acropolis,52 and most of them, consulting the convenience of the reader, had their inscriptions placed on the column; but these inscriptions were either on the round surface, often smoothed, if the column was plain, or in the channel of the flutings, if the column was fluted. If we may trust the evidence of what has survived, the Callimachus dedication was the only one to depart from this norm by having two inscribed flutings while the rest of the column was plain. The theory that the surviving epigram is a secondary inscription does not by itself explain this unique feature, but it enables us to speculate about the reason. Though most of the column dedications have the inscription on the column, not all have it so,53 and it is quite possible that, as we suggested earlier, the original dedicatory inscription had been placed on the base, leaving the column entirely free. If that was so, there can be little doubt that the purpose of engraving the new epigram within two flutings was to attract attention to the addition. On the other hand, it may well have been that the original dedicatory inscription was on the column within a smoothed area on the very spot where the flutings are now. In that case, the present flutings have removed all traces of the earlier inscription. But even so, it is arguable that the desire to make the change conspicuous played its part, because it would have been possible to erase the first inscription and substitute another one without going to the length of cutting the flutings. 51 The letter space of the restored epigram would take up about 1i97 m. The height of the whole monument, statue included, must have been about 3'50 m. That was very considerable for a dedication (cf. Raubitschek, BSA XL (1939-40), 22-23 for the height of some other dedications). 52 DAA p. 3 ff. should be consulted for numbers and examples of types; see also BSA XL (1939-40), 28 for the type of unfluted column. ,1 See n. 15. One inscribed column base has survived, DAA 58.</page><page sequence="22">THE DEDICATION OF CALLIMACHUS (IG I2 609) 16I The epigram, as we have restored it, makes the proudest boast a Greek could make, to have brought credit upon his city and to have acquitted himself with honour. If Wilhelm's supplement, adopted by us, is right ([%s(a)-ricas "rroMX] apXopX... T6v dcyva), then Callimachus' title to this claim was that he, as Athenian Commander-in-Chief, was responsible for the battle dispositions which led to the victory.54 This positive claim, so different from the standard praise of a man's bravery,55 makes one inclined to agree with Jacoby, who saw in the second line evidence for' a clash of aspirations after the battle, as to whom the victory was due '.56 Jacoby rightly saw that the second line did not belong to a dedicatory inscription. It did not give the reason for the dedication, but was a 'footnote' on Callimachus. He therefore adopted Hiller's view against Wilhelm and Raubitschek. In this he judged correctly, for Hiller, on this point, was nearer the truth than his successors.57 The striking fact of a posthumous addition to a dedication, the positive claim to have been the person responsible for the victory, the conspicuous way in which this claim is displayed on the column, makes one wonder whether our epigram was not intended by Callimachus' friends to point against pretensions of Miltiades which may have become loud immediately after the battle.58 If so, we know that this protest was ineffective. Callimachus' bravery and his heroic death, which received only conventional or implied mention in the 64 The claim is considerable. There are few docu- ments with which our inscription can be compared, but for the Homeric meaning of a-ricaat as a general's function see the examples collected by Jacoby, Hesp XIV (I945), 184 n. 105 (cf. also the reflection of the Homeric KoaUEiv (II. II, 554) in the Eion epigrams). 55 For examples see pp. I50-I. 56 Hesp XIV (I945), 158 n. 8. Cf. also Mnemosyne Ser. 3, XIII (I947), 31. 57 Cf. pp. 142-3. I hope that the difference between my view and that of Hiller is clear. I do not suggest that the present inscription contains any elements of the original dedicatory inscription at all. All five hexameters, as we have them now, belong to the secondary inscription (cf., however, n. 12 adfin.). ' This dedication was put up by Callimachus, who. . 58 These pretensions may have been justified. We cannot now assess fairly the respective parts played by the two personalities, especially since we know nothing about Callimachus previously, except that he must have been wealthy enough to dedicate the quite distinguished marble statue identified by Raubitschek. There is, indeed, another fragmentary column, IG IP 767 (FIG. I), fluted all round and of poros, which once carried a dedication and still preserves the following inscription: K]ahilpaXos copiat The date is near the turn of the century-after it rather than before, despite one or two old-fashioned forms. The date of the inscription would therefore favour M the view that we have here an earlier dedication by the same Callimachus, but the use of coqiq( in the second line does nothing to support it. Certainly it was Miltiades who, as head of a great noble house, was responsible for the decree under which the army marched to Marathon (Aristotle, Rhet. III, Io0, 3 (14xia); Schol. ad Demosth. de Fals. Leg. 438, 16), and who also, by his initiative, forced the decision to fight there (Herod. VI, Io9). On the other hand, careful reading of the Herodotus passage shows that the polemarch had overriding, if not sole, powers to make the decision, and if he made it against the majority vote of the Council of Generals his action, however influenced, was all the more commendable (cf. Berve, Miltiades 80). Miltiades' position was only that of one amongst ten, and he was liable to be over- ruled by the majority. But ifCallimachus had supreme powers of decision in council, he will have had supreme command on the field, too, and therefore the now hardly intelligible surrender of the prrpvrawvll ris fiAppas by each general to Miltiades can scarcely have meant more than that Miltiades was permanent Second-in- Command. The battle disposition may well have followed Miltiades' plan (he had had experience with the Persians), but final authority must have come from Callimachus. Aristot. 'Awr 22, 2 confirms this view of Callimachus' position at the time, as does Callimachus' position on the right wing (Herod. VI, I I). Both claims, therefore, that of Miltiades and the one in favour of Callimachus, were well-grounded, but not unnaturally the claims of one of the great leaders in the state, who also seems to have been the driving force behind the battle, were stronger from the beginning.</page><page sequence="23">162 B. B. SHEFTON epigram, became legendary and canonized; his responsibility for the victory, the gravamen of the epigram, was forgotten and attributed to Miltiades. In the Stoa Poikile Miltiades as strategos led the Athenians, pointing out the enemy, whereas Callimachus was shown mortally wounded, but fighting on in supreme heroism.59 This version of Callimachus' part, hallowed by the great painting, became current with later writers and a commonplace amongst rhetoricians.60 Herodotus still gives Callimachus the decisive vote at the IG I2, 767- Cf. p. 161, n. 58. council of war, but his account might make us think that the tactical dis- position of the battle was all Miltiades' work.61 Against this version, which may well have gained currency immediately after the battle, and not, as is usually thought, as the result of Cimon's ascendancy later, the epigram added on the column of an earlier but prominent dedication of Callimachus seems to have been a protest. It claimed due credit for the polemarch as polemarch. Stress is laid, in the epigram, on the fact that Marathon was fought on 59 For Miltiades cf. e.g. Aeschin. in Ctes. I86 and Schol. ad Aristid.

For Callimachus no direct evidence is available, but there are allusions in various writers to the fact that his dead body was held upright by the number of spears that had pierced it, so that even in death he appeared to be fighting (cf. e.g. Himerius, X, 2 and Suidas s.v. ''l.irrla, 'AOMvalkov Tpavvos'). It is a fair inference from the words used by Himerius that this topos was taken from a motive in the painting in the Stoa. The literary evidence for the painting in the Stoa is collected and discussed by C. Robert, ' Marathonschlacht' (18 Hall. Winckelmannsprogramm). Later discussions add little of importance to our enquiry. so E.g. Plut. Moral. 305 b, c; 347 d; Himerius, or. II, 21; Polemon, or.

This is of interest, because we find the same feeling in the first of the two Marathon epigrams: 62 'EAA?&amp;[86 p]E 'rrcaav Soil'xto[v Ekap i8v]. In this awareness the first Marathon epigram differs from the second, which is only interested in the danger as it had affected Athens. The difference between these two points of view has often been the subject of comment, and Jacoby 63 has suggested that later dissatisfaction with the first poem on the score of its too catholic view may have been the reason for the addition of the second epigram. The Callimachus epigram shares the sentiment of the first and original Marathon epigram. Both the Callimachus and the two Marathon epigrams are securely dated between 490 and 480.64 Hence, the arguments heard in the past,65 that until after the invasion of Xerxes it would not have been seen that 490 was a year of crisis not only for Athens but for the whole of Greece, need no longer be given serious consideration. It is, however, of some importance in estimating the strength of the Athenian claim to leadership in the negotiations before 480, to realize that both publicly and privately Athens' achievement was pro- claimed in terms of having by her own efforts, unaided except by the Plataeans, saved the whole of Greece.66 B. B. SHEFTON 62 See n. 2. 63 Hesp XIV (I945), 177/8; cf. Bowra, Greek Lyric Poetry, 356. 64 The terminus post quem for the Marathon epigrams is 490; the terminus ante quem is 480, the date of the sack of Athens, which must have seen the destruction of the monument, because neither epigram is found in any of the later collections, and the newly-found Agora frag- ment shows a great freshness of surface, arguing a short period of intact existence for the monument (cf. AJA XLIV (1940), 483). It is unreasonable to suppose that utter disaster could have overtaken an important public monument shortly after 480, when so plausible an occasion can be found in 480. This line of argument is reinforced to some extent by consideration of the Hekatompedon inscription (IG I1 3/4), the attribution of which to the engraver of the first Marathon epigram by Wilhelm (AM XXIII (1898), 489 ff.) has been confirmed by the new Agora fragment (see n. 2), which gives more scope for the comparison (cf. AnzAkWien 1934, ro8 ff). The style of the Hek- atompedon inscription is too close to that of the Mara- thon epigram to allow a great interval between the two. If anything, it is later (for a possible earlier inscription by the same hand see IG I2 645 + 497 - DAA 58; cf. JHS LX (I940), 53 and our n. 58). Now there can be little doubt that Kirchhoff's restoration of the archon of 485/4 in both inscriptions, viz. Ht (lj[tlhoKp &amp;r]os apX[ovr]os in IG P2 3, 16 and tlf]i I0[ oKxp&amp;ros &amp;PXOVT] os in IG I1 4, 26, as the only name that will fit, is right, seeing that, with two excep- tions, we know the eponymous archons for every year in the eighties and have a complete list for the succeeding years. Of the two exceptions, 486 will not affect any chronological conclusions regarding the Marathon epigrams which we may base upon the Hekatompedon inscription; the other year, 482, would affect them, but the chances that the missing archon name also fulfilled all the conditions required by the stoichedon inscription are small. On the other hand, a pre-49o date for the Hekatompedon inscription would argue a fortiori a pre-48o date for the Marathon epigrams. Though there are some gaps in the archon-list of the early nineties, and in 493, if we accept a late archonship for Themistocles, it is highly improbable that the Hekatompedon inscription belongs there. The still earlier date recently argued again by Miss Guarducci (Ann. N.S. III-IV (1941-2), 12 ff.) is untenable. 65 e.g. Hiller, Hermes LXIX (1934), 205. 66 There is another epigram expressing much the same point of view, of which the best version occurs in Lycurgus, in Leocrat. I I I, where it is quoted side by side with the distich on the Spartan dead at Thermopylae (Hiller I2 = Diehl 88 (90)): 'EX1vcov 1TpopaXo0vTES 'AerlvaTiot Mapca6avt Xpuaop6pcav M~wiov oa-r6pwacv 8Ovativ. The date and nature (certainly no epitaph) of the epigram is uncertain. It is in structure like A.P.

Such a version does away with the need to assume a secondary dedication. For that reason, however, it does nothing to explain the singular feature of the two flutings on the otherwise plain column. after the period of the Persian wars. This may well be true, but the arguments adduced for this view are inconclusive. Suidas, s.v. ' oloKiTo aroT is not sufficient evidence for the theory that the epigram stood under the painting in the Stoa Poikile. The text can be interpreted quite differently. Another argument, used by Friedliinder (Stud. Ital. Fil. Class. N.S. XV (1938), 98), that the phrase 'EnXXivov TrpouaXoUvTES was not possible until the events of 480 and later had given the perspective, based itself upon the belief that there was a case for putting the Marathon epigrams after 480. Once that has gone (see n. 64), Friedliinder's view becomes as untenable for the epigram quoted by Lycurgus as Hiller's view (see n. 65) is for the Marathon epigrams. We find, then, that no reason has as yet been put forward which is sufficient to prevent us from regarding both epigrams, Lycurgus, in Leocrat. SIi and A.P. VII, 257, as contemporary with the Persian wars and possibly earlier than 480. Neither, however, is there any cogent positive evidence for an early date (cf. also Jacoby, Hesp XIV (1945), 16o, n. I7). T. J. Dunbabin reminds me of Pindar, Pyth.
