<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRUCE VERMAZEN THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES (Received in final form 9 December, 1976) I. 'OUGHT' AND DEONTIC LOGIC Deontic logic has been variously conceived as the logic of norms, directives, imperatives, commands, permission, forbiddance, and obligations. Sometimes the calculus offered as a deontic logic is offered in explication of some part of a natural language, sometimes in explication of concepts that we have but that are unclearly expressed in everyday speech, and sometimes as a replace- ment for the muddled concepts and/or language we ordinarily operate with. The label, from the Greek word for duty or what is binding, is not unsuited to such a variety of enterprises. But in most writing on the subject, the' modal auxiliary 'ought' is prominent, sometimes as the name of one of the operators with which 'deontic expressions' are formed, sometimes as one of the English expressions whose meaning is to be made clear by the logic offered. Usage tends to vary within single articles, however. Where the writer is using 'O' as the special deontic modal symbol, an expression like 'OF(a)' may be rendered in one place as 'It ought to be that F(a)' or 'a ought to F', in another as 'a is obligated to F', in another as 'a is obliged to F', and so on. Since it seems obvious that some pairs of these renderings have different truth-conditions,1 one wonders whether a theorem that seems intuitively valid when 'O' is replaced by 'is obligated' will seem so when 'O' is replaced by 'ought' and vice versa; often it will not. Take a simple example of a theorem found in all deontic logics where 'O' is treated as an operation symbol: '-(Op &amp; 0fp)'. Here, if we understand 'O' as picking out what is sometimes called 'the over- riding 'ought" or 'the absolute 'ought", we get the clearly true reading that it can't be the case both that one ought to do something and that one ought not to do it. But if, instead, we read 'O' as 'is obligatory', we get something false for some values of 'p', for it seems clear that one can have an obligation to do something and also an obligation not to, as when one has signed two contracts, one to pay rent and one to withhold rent.

Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">2 BRUCE VERMAZEN My project in this essay is to show, for the sense of 'ought' that is com- monly discussed by moral philosophers, what the principles are which seem to govern the entailments one feels to hold between sentences containing that 'ought'. Because of the sort of consideration just brought forward, I want to separate this question - let me call it the question of the logical behavior of the practical 'ought' - from the questions of the logical behavior of 'obliga- tion', 'obligatory', 'oblige', and 'obligate'. My strategy will be to attempt to state the truth-conditions for a certain important range of English sentences containing this 'ought'. Deontic logic of the sort exemplified by the systems of Kanger, Hintikka, A. R. Anderson and Prior2 can also be seen as such an attempt, but one that, for a number of reasons, does not succeed. Still, the approach has appealed to these and other careful and thoughtful writers. I suspect that appeal has been twofold: first, the systems in question amount in part to Lewis-type modal calculi with 'O' substituted for 'O', but with 'Op -- p' excluded as an axiom or theorem, so that many of the logical properties of these well investigated calculi will also belong to their deontic counterparts; and second, many of the theorems and axioms, insofar as they are intelligible at all, have an intuitively valid ring. The present essay will lack the first kind of appeal, but will at first proceed by looking closely at the precise appeal of the second sort that one finds in the definition and set of axioms for a propositional deontic logic offered by A. N. Prior.3 There is nothing special about Prior's system; I choose it as typical of deontic logics. Df. P. Pp = Op (01) O(Op-+p) (02) Op - Pp (03) O(p -q) -(Op -Oq) (04) O(p -q) -(Op -Oq) If we read any of these axioms consistently with 'It ought to be the case that' for 'O' and 'It is permissible that' for 'P', there seems to be nothing much to offend our intuitions, except perhaps the flavor of an useen authority carried by 'permissible' in (02). But if we try to vary the reading to accommodate the kinds of sentences we use in talking about what people ought to do, we run into trouble. The trouble seems to show that the 'ought' I am interested in can't be the 'ought', if there is one, whose logical behavior is described by</page><page sequence="3">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENrENCES 3 deontic logics. A pervasive problem is that while the usual syntactic shape of the 'ought'-sentences I am concerned with is a noun phrase followed by 'ought' followed by an infinitive phrase, that shape is not available for the paraphrase of sentences with iterated 'O'. So if we are to use the usual shape, we must mix in a few occurrences of 'it ought to be the case that'. Suppose, then, that I give (01) this reading: 'It ought to be the case that if someone ought to do something, then he does it'. It seems to me that ordinarily in saying something ought to be the case one is picking out some feature of the (or an) ideal state of affairs,4 so that one may paraphrase (01) further as 'In the ideal state of affairs, if someone ought to do something, then he does it'. But this is not obviously true; maybe the ideal state of affaris allows for some backsliding in unimportant matters. The bare admission of that possibility strongly suggests that the 'ought' in the sentence prefix and the 'ought' within the sentence, as ordinarily understood, are improperly rendered by a single symbol of the calculus. And that suggests that if Prior's axioms are adequate to the logic of ideal states of affairs, they are perhaps not adequate to the logic of 'ought'-sentences such as 'Someone ought to do something', i.e., ones where the 'ought' is flanked by a subject-expression and an infinitive phrase. This is a serious matter, since every attempt to assimilate the logic of 'ought' to modal logic (such as Prior's) includes (01) as an axiom or theorem; and nearly every deontic logic is an attempt of that sort.5 The appeal of (01), then, seems to depend on reading 'O' as 'it ought to be the case that' or 'in the ideal state of affairs'. Hence, provisionally, I shall set it aside as a sen- tence embodying an intuition about the wrong sense of 'ought'. But you need not be happy about my setting it aside until I have said more about senses of 'ought' toward the end of this chapter. (03), on the other hand, seems to be a principle that takes care of cases where we feel that there is an entailment-relation between 'ought'-sentences of my special sort. For example, if a man ought either to lead or not to waltz, then if he ought to waltz, he ought to lead. At first glance, we obviously also want a principle like (04) to cover cases like this: if someone's dancing follows necessarily from his waltzing, then if he ought to waltz, he ought to dance. This principle appears to be employed very frequently in moral ar- gument: an agent looks at the necessary consequences of what he thinks he ought to do in order to see whether they too appeal to him as what he ought to do; if not, he can argue by contraposition that his initial opinion was wrong. But the principle behind such an argument seems to admit of applica-</page><page sequence="4">4 BRUCE VERMAZEN tions not admitted by (04). I may think I ought to waltz and discover that doing so would cause my aunt to be shocked. I know that I ought not to shock her and so decide I was wrong about waltzing in the first place. The argument seems to go this way: suppose I ought to waltz; if I waltz, I shock; so I ought to shock; but I ought not to shock; so -(I ought to shock); hence by reductio, -(I ought to waltz).6 Here is seems that the 'ought' is transfer- red from one action to another not because of a necessary consequence of my proposed action, but because of a mere projected causal consequence of it. But the argument is of a sort we all accept. Hence (04), as well as its analogues in other standard formulations, is too restricted to do justice to this feature of the logic of 'ought'. It would seem to need supplementation, but as I shall soon point out, even in its present form, it gives rise to the difficulty called the Good Samaritan Paradox, so that it also needs restriction. I shall ultimately just get rid of it, replacing with a set of principles that, I hope, captures the intuition that gives (04) its (specious) appeal. Another problem arises within deontic logics that are slightly more complex than Prior's, in that they include quantification, at least over in- dividuals. Hintikka's system, for instance, exhibits this extra complexity. Consider this intuitively valid argument: Billy the Kid ought to surrender. Billy the Kid is William Bonney. So William Bonney ought to give himself up. There would seem to be two ways to formalize this in Hintikka's style, each of which leads to an unsatisfactory result.7 I will use 'S' for 'surrenders', 'b' for 'Billy the Kid', and 'w' for 'William Bonney'. (I) OSb b = w OSw (II) (3x)((x = b) &amp; OSx) b = w (3x)((x = w) &amp; OSx) Paraphrase (II) is suggested by Hintikka's work on epistemic logic.8 Its ad- vantage is that no free singular term need occur within the scope of 'O'. Thus, if a semantic account of the calculus is furnished in terms of possible worlds, one need not worry whether the names 'b' and 'w' designate the same in-</page><page sequence="5">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 5 dividual in all the relevant possible worlds. The possibility that they should fail to be co-referential in some possible world is just what renders paraphrase (I) invalid. It would be valid if the second line were 'O(b = w)' or 'OJ(b = w)', for then 'b' and 'w' would be co-referential in all the relevant possible worlds, but ordinarily we seem to allow substitution in 'ought' contexts (most clearly in subject position) on the strength of non-modalized identity statements. Perhaps Kripke's persuasive views in 'Naming and Necessity'9 entail that where the names 'a' and 'b' are rigid designators, 'a = b' entails 'O(a = b)', so that substitution of the modalized identity premise is licensed. But at any rate without this supplementation, there is no saving (I). Paraphrase (II) is valid in Hintikka's system, but the adoption of this style of paraphrase for all 'ought'-sentences containing free singular terms would render invalid some other intuitively valid inferences, for instance this very simple one: Billy ought to draw. Billy ought to shoot. So Billy ought to draw and shoot. paraphrased thus: (3x)((b = x) &amp; ODx) (3x)((b =x)&amp;OSx) (3x)((b = x) &amp; O(Dx &amp; Sx)) The proof is given in the Appendix to this essay, but intuitively the problem is that we have no assurance that, in every 'deontic alternative' or possible world compatible with Billy's real-world 'oughts', there is some object whose name could be used to generate true instances of both the existential statements that form the premises. Again, however, it must be admitted that if names are rigid designators, it will be possible to evade this objection. So there seems to be a dilemma for this sort of quantified deontic logic: either we preserve substitution on the strength of unmodalized identity state- ments or we preserve inferences that create compound predicates from simple ones, but not both. Since presumably we want to preserve both, the Hintikka, approach must be modified or given up. Deontic logic has also more traditional woes. Any tautology prefixed by 'O' is a theorem in all the standard treatments, as is any self-contradition prefixed by '0-'. It isn't clear how distressed one ought to be at this state</page><page sequence="6">6 BRUCE VERMAZEN of affairs. Prior tells us not to worry. Perhaps the most discussed, and miost vexing, problem in the field, though, is the Paradox of the Good Samaritan. 'Jim ought to help the man who was beaten and robbed' gets treated as 'O(Jim helps the man who was beaten and robbed)'. The sentence in parentheses entails 'the man was beaten and robbed'. And that, by (04), entails 'O(the man was beaten and robbed)',10 which is an unsatisfactory result. Many solu- tions have been proposed for the Paradox. The best attempt, to my mind, was made by Robert Nozick and Robert Routley in 'Escaping the Good Samaritan Paradox,' (Mind n.s. 71 (1962), 377-382). They rightly note that in the usual formulations of the Paradox it is not the action of helping the victim which entails he has been robbed, but the description of the action which does so (379). They attempt to give a serious semantic role to actions by introducing names 'a', 'b', etc., that refer to something like sorts of kinds of action (although Nozick and Routley call the denotata 'actions'), an operator 'D' such that 'Da' is true if and only if action a is done, and a connective 'I' such that 'Iab' is true if and only if action a is included in action b. The negation operator 'N' has a double interpretation, so that it operates both in the usual way in sentences and in such a way on action-names that 'Da' and 'DNa' can't both be true, so that it means something like 'to fail forever'. The connectives 'K' and 'A' receive a similar double interpretation, but it is not spelled out. The special axioms for 'D' and 'I', from which we are to gather their properties, are these (380; I have left these axioms in the original notation rather than trying to devise equivalents for the unfamiliar connectives within the more usual sort of notation): 11. EDNaNDa 14. CIAabcAIacIbc 12. CDaCIbaDb IS. IaKab 13. CIabCIbcIac 16. CINaNbIba I suspect that the double role of 'N', 'K', and 'A' would lead to some trouble in constructing a formal semantics for this calculus, but Nozick and Routley ultimately expressed dissatisfaction with their account on other grounds. They characterized the inclusion relation informally thus: 'Iab' is true if there exists a description of action b alone such that a description of action a is thereby given, where D is a description of b alone if D is a description of b, and no phrase of D [other than redundant ones] can be eliminated without a less detailed description of b resulting (379).</page><page sequence="7">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 7 The notion of degree of detail of a description here is not entirely clear, but to make everything come out right, it is supposed to divide cases so that 'looking at a man' is no less detailed a description of the action than 'looking at a man who murdered someone', whereas 'shooting a man' is less detailed than 'shooting a man and causing his death'. Even given such a scale for degree of detail, Nozick and Routley reject their characterization in a note appended to their article, because of such counterexamples as the case where the time at which action b is performed is specified by saying 'b occurs two hours after ', where the blank is filled in by a detailed description of some other action (382). The problem is that given their notion of degree of detail, the action whose description fills the blank must be counted as included in action b, no matter how remote the connection. The strength of their account is that they attempt to count types of action as individuals, so that natural-language discourse about entailment between actions is mirrored formally not by entailment between sentences, but by relations between these action-type-individuals, so that the Good Samaritan Paradox is indeed escaped. In ordinary deontic logics, talk of actions is merely talk about the extensions of verbs of action or about the states of affairs that make sentences containing verbs of action true. My proposal, in its first ver- sion, will be an attempt to give a serious semantic role to something correlated more closely with types of action, viz., predicates of action. Relations of en- tailment between actions are mirrored formally by relations between predicates of action.' The second version will attempt to construct action-types out of the properties of agents. The two versions have in common the absence of any recourse to deontic logic, as well as the absence of its defects just cata- logued, as I hope to show in what follows. Deontic logic does not, I think, truly describe the logical behavior of what I shall call the practical 'ought'. Before I can present my proposal, I need to state more precisely which 'ought'-sentences I am attempting to provide truth-conditions for. So far I have spoken only of sentences where 'ought' is flanked by a subject-expres- sion and an infinitive phrase, but that is too broad. Consider the following sentences: (1) You ought to be in pictures. (2) You ought to be the President. (3) He ought to be a creature with a heart.</page><page sequence="8">8 BRUCE VERMAZEN (4) Mercury ought to be visible 100 above the horizon. (5) The train ought to be in Richmond by now. (6) You ought to take care of yourself. I want to claim that there are three senses of 'ought' present in this array of sentences, though no sentence is such that it must be interpreted univocally which respect to the 'ought' in it; indeed, there may not be such sentences, though there certainly are settings of utterance that force us toward one or another univocal interpretation. The best that can be said for these sentences is that each has a most likely interpretation, and that these interpretations exhibit the three senses. The principal feature of 'ought'-sentences that I think supports my claim that there are three senses is that in different contexts of utterance different sorts of premises need to be introduced to license inferences from one 'ought'- sentence to another. There is first a sort of context in which people endow the world with whatever features they think it would be good for it to have, and express the result with an 'ought'. Sentences (1) and (2) above are sup- posed to be typical of such contexts. Sentence (1) can't be refuted by point- ing out that there are no more pictures to be in if the person who asserted it is willing also to say that there ought to be pictures. But if he says at the same time that there ought not to be pictures, he has contradicted himself (as people will in such contexts). The features of the world, and hence the in- ferences one can draw from the 'ought'-sentences, are pretty much up to the utterer. There is another sort of context in which investigation or prediction is going on and 'ought'-sentences are used to express the results (or expected results) of the investigation or to express a prediction. The results or predic- tion expressed are not treated simply as those as a matter offact reached or warranted by the investigation, however, but as those that would have been reached or warranted by an investigation employing the best humanly avail- able evidence with no mistakes in measurement, inference, or other opera- tions leading to its issue. So the pre-Galilean who said 'This lead ball ought to hit the ground sooner than this ball of silk thread' was saying something false, whereas the Pompeiian weather forecaster who said 'It ought to be sunny tomorrow' on the eve of the day Vesuvius darkened the sky said something true. For we feel that the pre-Galilean could have come up with the right sort of evidence to falsify his general hypothesis about falling bodies, while volcanic eruptions are not the sort of thing we think we can predict.</page><page sequence="9">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 9 (The evidence provided by direct observation of the time and space of the predicted result does not count for or against the truth of the 'ought'-sen- tence; I can truly assert (5) even though I am at the Richmond station and it is clear that the train is not there.) Sentences (3)-(5) are meant to be typical of such contexts. In this sort of case, there seems to be one pattern of inference whose validity is not up to the utterer of the sentence. Let the sentence we get by dropping the 'ought' and changing the infinitive following the 'ought' to a finite form that agrees with the subject-expression preceding the 'ought' be called the indicative corresponding to the original 'ought'-sentence. E.g., for (5) the corresponding indicative is 'The train is in Richmond now'. If there is some premise that is known by the investigators to be true and that would license an inference from the corresponding indicative to some other indicative, then the same premise will also license the inference to the second indicative with 'It ought to be the case that' prefixed (as well as to the paraphrase of this sentence where 'ought' appears between a more substantive subject-expression and an infinitive). For example, from (5) and 'Everything now in Richmond will shortly be buried under cinders', we can infer 'The train ought shortly to be buried under cinders', provided that the best humanly available evidence includes the information about Richmond's imminent burial. No such inference would go through using 'ought' in the way first described, since it could be the speaker's whim that Richmond not be buried. The two cases differ further in that the second kind allows free substitu- tion of co-referential singular terms and definite descriptions (in otherwise referentially transparent contexts) on the basis of identity statements true at the time of the event reported in the corresponding indicative, whereas the first kind doesn't. For example, from (4) and 'Mercury is the smallest planet' we can infer 'The smallest planet ought to be visible 10? above the horizon'. Since the speaker's whim could be that Mercury not be the smallest planet, this inference would not go through using 'ought' in the way first described. Sentence (6) is meant to be typical of the sort of 'ought'-sentences used in contexts where people are deciding or planning what to do, or where they are prescribing or advising each other about what to do. As in the second sort of context, the inferences one can make are constrained by what is mutually known about the past, but also by whatever is true of the past but not actual- ly known. This is shown most clearly in cases where some new information</page><page sequence="10">10 BRUCE VERMAZEN shows that a certain prediction concerning a time now past was well-founded but false. Suppose the situation in which I set sentence (4) was also one in which Mercury, unknown to the investigators, had slowed down or disinte- grated prior to its predicted appearance. The investigators could still stick to their assertion of (4) on grounds that the slowing or disintegration could not have been noted in their fund of data - was not humanly available. But if I say Eleanor ought to swim for help, on the grounds that help is needed and she is the only person who can get it, and that by swimming, and if it turns out that help wasn't needed, then I can't stick to my original assertion, but must retract it, even if the information that help wasn't needed was not humanly available. It's easy to see why these contexts have this feature, since advice, plans, prescriptions, or decisions that aren't pretty heavily constrained by reality are likely to be less than useful, even harmful. But in the second kind of context, we are dealing with statements in which the 'ought' more or less signals that the corresponding indicative has only the strength conferred by a certain fund of data, so no purpose is served by point- ing out that a lesser strength is conferred by some other fund of data, even if the latter fund is closer to the truth. We might say that each of the three sorts of context puts a different load of reality on the 'ought'-sentences asserted in it. My task might be, then, to give an account of the truth-conditions of 'ought' that shows the common core present in all three contexts and the features of each context that deter- mine what reality-load is to be placed on the 'ought'. There are three reasons why this course doesn't appeal to me. First, the differences the reality loads make are more or less discontinuous: it seems that there are contexts of the three kinds described, but no intermediate ones, e.g., ones where inferences are warranted by all known facts and some unknown ones, but not others. Since whim can range very widely, it's possible to imagine all sorts of inter- mediate cases, but in fact one doesn't encounter them. Second, the differences the reality-loads make issue in some logical differences, such as the fact that in the second and third kinds of context, 'ought'-sentences seem to be referen- tially transparent, whereas the first kind makes them opaque unless the identity- statement ought to be true. These different degrees of opacity would require different formal treatment for the different contexts. Finally, my appeal to 'contexts' has been rather vague. There certainly are single contexts in which a single 'ought'-sentence can receive two interpre- tations such that one of them is true and the other false. Someone says</page><page sequence="11">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 11 (7) Jones ought to be taking the oath of office. Jones, the best man for the post, died a few days after the election. So it is open to me to deny (7) on grounds that Jones is past doing anything at all, and so is let off from whatever we might prescribe or advise. But it is also open to me to affirm (7) on grounds that, after all, he was the best man. There is no tension here, no need to decide between denial and affirmation, for the statement is felt to be both false and true. (Of course, the speaker probably meant to assert only one of the interpretations.) Since the variation in truth-value can be attributed to a single word in the sentence, we have here the sort of situation that motivates us to call the crucial word ambiguous. We can exhibit the same features in a situation having characteristics of the second and third sorts of contexts. I say (8) Lopez ought to be taking the oath of office. My assertion (for all one can tell from its surface form) can be supported by noting that great loss of life and property would result from the riots which would surely mark his failure to appear at the ceremony. It can be rebutted by noting that Lopez will probably not recover from his wounds, hence will be unable to attend the ceremony. The discussion of (4) above shows a case in which the first and second sorts of 'context' are mixed: perhaps Mercury ought not even to exist. In both cases there seems to be no reason to decide between the affirmation and the denial, and this is an indication we are treating 'ought' as ambiguous. I propose to treat 'ought' as having three distinct senses, corresponding to the uses exhibited in the three contexts. I shall call them respectively the ideal, epistemic, and practical 'ought'. A full account of the distinction of senses could only be given by a full treatment of the satisfaction- and truth- conditions for sentences containing all three senses, and I propose to give such a treatment only for the practical 'ought'. But some rough indications can be given beyond those provided by my discussion in terms of contexts of ut- terance. The 'ought' in sentences (l)-(3) can be paraphrased by 'In the ideal state of affairs' prefixed to the corresponding indicative, or by 'It would be best if' prefixed to the clause obtained by removing the 'ought' and changing the infinitive to a subjunctive. By the former method, (1) becomes 'In the ideal state of affairs, you are in pictures'; by the latter, 'It would be best if you</page><page sequence="12">12 BRUCE VERMAZEN were in pictures'. The deontic logic systems presented by Hintikka, Prior, Kanger, and A. R. Anderson all seem adequate representations of this sense of 'ought', provided that the ideal state of affairs is constructed according to the laws of logic. (4) and (5) might be paraphrased by embedding the corresponding indi- cative in the sentence-context 'the assertion that is warranted by the best humanly available evidence, excluding direct-observational verification or falsification'. Perhaps its logic could be represented adequately by a formalized theory of confirmation. The paraphrases offered for (I)-(3) and (4)-(5) won't work for (6), but I don't want to offer a separate paraphrase for it, since the rest of this essay will exhibit its logic in a fuller way than a paraphrase could. Difference in paraphrase is only a necessary condition of difference in sense, but taken together with the other considerations it at least gives a bit of extra color to my claims. Similar distinctions of sense are familiar from current literature on the subject.'2 The practical 'ought' has two surface peculiarities: the subject-expression may intelligibly refer only to a possible agent (and not, e.g., to a train or a planet, except by personification) and the principal verb in the infinitive phrase may only be a verb of action (not, hence, 'to be', except as an ac- cidental fragment of a progressive infinitive like 'to be skating'). What follows requires a characterization of verbs of action. Part of a criterion is suggested by Donald Davidson's discussion of the related question when we impute agency, in 'The Logical Form of Action Sentences'"3: for some verbs, we impute agency to the person who is said to have 4d just in case it makes sense to ask whether he Od intentionally. We can adopt a version of this for some verbs: 'O' is a verb of action if it makes sense to ask whether a person who is said to have kd Od intentionally. As I use the expression, it makes sense to ask a yes-no question in case the terms in which the question is couched don't already imply a 'yes' or 'no' answer. Obviously there are verbs of action where it doesn't make that kind of sense to ask that question, e.g., 'pretend', 'deliberate', 'concentrate', for it follows from a's bing in these cases that a 4d intentionally. Another class of verbs not covered by the proposed criterion in- cludes 'miscalculate', 'make a mistake', 'misspeak oneself', for it follows here from a's /ing that a didn't X intentionally. (Alvin Goldman uses this class to object to a claim of Davidson's in Goldman's A Theory of Human Action (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1970), 17.) However, it does follow that a tried to</page><page sequence="13">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 13 do something intentionally, e.g., calculate, get it right, talk straight. So both classes of exceptions can be covered by adding a disjunct to the criterion: ' is a verb of action if and only if either it makes sense to ask whether a person who is said to have Od Od intentionally or it follows from the assertion that a person Od that his 4ing was intentional under some description.14 This is not a syntactical test, of course, but it is perhaps as good as we can get. Davidson suggests that the element that makes some verbs verbs of action is simply introduced by certain verbs and not by others; when we understand the verb we recognize whether or not it includes the idea of an agent (94).

N. Prior, 'Escapism: the Logical Basis of Ethics', in A.I. Melden (ed.), Essays in Moral Philosophy (Seattle, 1958). 3 Op. cit., 135. Prior, it should be said, is pretty consistent in reading 'O' as 'It is obli- gatory that', although at one point he reads 'COpMp' as 'What I ought I can', and the last sentence of the article (146) suggests that what preceded had something to do with what one ought to do. I have changed the notation of his axioms for the sake of uniformity. 4 The semantical treatments of deontic logic offered by Hintikka (op. cit.) and Kanger (op. cit.) make use of such an equivalence. 5 Sometimes the ideal state of affairs envisaged by the utterer of the 'ought'-sentence is not ideal tout court, but only ideal relative to some framework held constant, e.g., the state of affairs at the present moment minus a few unpleasant features. In this way it presents the same sort of vagueness as to intended conditions of truth as a subjunctive conditional. But even an only relatively ideal state of affairs may allow for backsliding, so the objection raised above still holds: on one reading of the second 'O', (01) is false. 6 This reductio won't work on the principles I propose later. It will work if 'I ought not to shock' is read 'I ought never to shock', which I think is the intended intepretation in such an argument. On my principles, 'I ought to shock' and 'I ought not to shock' are not true contradictories, not even internal contradictories. 7 In 'Semantics and Semantics', Foundations of Language 7 (1971), 539-555, I wrongly maintained that paraphrase I was the only possible rendering of the argument within the Hintikka system. 8 An almost indistinguishable proposal is suggested by Lou Goble, in 'Opacity and the Ought-to-be', Nous 7 (1973), 407-412. The slight distinction is that his suggestion con- cerns sentences about what ought to be the case rather than ones about what someone ought to do. 9 In D. Davidson and G. Harman (eds.), Semantics of Natural Language (Dordrecht, 1972), 253-355. 10 A more usual and piquant form uses the forbiddance operator 'F' = 'ON' and argues that one ought not help the victim. " Hector-Neri Castanieda's system of deontic logic as presented in 'On the Semantics of</page><page sequence="14">14 BRUCE VERMA ZEN the Ought-to-do', in Davidson and Harman (op. cit.), 675-694, escapes the paradox by distinguishing prescriptions from indicatives, but I find his system unsatisfactory on other grounds, for which see below. 12 See, e.g. I. L. Humberstone, 'Two sorts of 'ought's', Analysis 32 (1971), 8-11; Hector-Neri Castafieda (op.cit.); Richard Robinson, 'Ought and ought not', Philosophy 46 (1971), 193-202; and Gilbert Harman, 'Moral Relativism Defended', Philosophical Review 84 (1975), 3-22. None of these writers distinguishes exactly my three senses, but the distinctions they make either nearly coincide with mine or can be seen as dis- tinctions between cases within a single one of my senses. Roger Wertheimer, in The Significance of Sense (Ithaca, N.Y., 1972), and Alan R. White, in Modal Thinking (Ithaca, N.Y., 1975), have argued that 'ought' is univocal. For arguments against Wertheimer, see my review of his book in The Journal of Philosophy 71 (1974), 506-512. White does detect a difference between indicative-governing and subjunctive-governing uses of 'ought' that coincides with my distinction between the epistemic sense on the one hand and the ideal and practical senses together on the other. To my mind, White's account is rather an exploration of the similarities between the dif- ferent senses than a demonstration of univocality. But if his case were made, the present essay would become an attempt to specify exactly what 'fills the gap' or what is 'owing' in situations where 'ought' governs the subjunctive of an action verb. 13 In Nicholas Rescher (ed.), 77Te Logic of Decision and Action (Pittsburgh, 1967), 81-95. lo Phrasing the criterion in terms of intentionality-under-a-description presupposes the 'identity thesis' concerning actions, which is briefly discussed in Chapter 1I of the present essay. Gonzalo Munevar pointed out to me that the second disjunct of the crite- rion can't be 'it follows from the assertion that a person pd that he did something in- tentionally', since for 0 = 'die after misspeaking himself' it follows from 'Ron od' that he did something intentionally. Yet we don't want 'die after misspeaking himself' to be a verb of action, since 'die' is not such a verb. II. THE INHERITANCE PRINCIPLE I want now to examine the sorts of case that I think Prior's (04), Nozick and Routley's 12-16, and their analogues in other systems, are meant to account for insofar as it applies to the practical 'ought'. My purpose is to discover a principle that will cover the cases (04) (e.g.) does not, and that will exclude certain awkward cases (Good-Samaritan-Paradox cases) that (04) admits. I will call it the Inheritance Principle (IP for short), since a very frequently encountered employment of it is the case where the attempt to do one thing unavoidably involves one in an attempt to do something else, and where consequently an 'ought' attached to the first action is inherited by the second. Consider the following sentences, which I think illustrate all the kinds of cases of 'ought'-inheritance: (1) I ought to swim for help. To swim is to natate. So I ought to natate for help. (2) I ought to waltz. Waltzing is dancing. So I ought to dance.</page><page sequence="15">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 15 (3) I ought to signal him. The only way to signal him given the cir- cumstances is to shout. So I ought to shout. (4) I ought to waltz. Given the circumstances, if I waltz, I will shock my aunt. So I ought to shock my aunt. (5) I ought to make an omelet. No one can make an omelet without breaking eggs. So I ought to break eggs. What is the relationship between the action-type that has the 'ought' in the first place and the action-type that inherits it? Adherents of (04) would per- haps say 'entailment', but that is only plausible for cases (1) and (2) if logical entailment is meant, and even there it is entailment mediated by facts about extra-logical segments of English. Nozick and Routley tried to take care of inheritance by defining the relation 'I' of action-inclusion.' But only case (5), and to a lesser extent case (3), seem well characterized by the notion of one action being included in another. My suggestion is that there are five separate relationships here, each of which warrants inheritance, and none of which has the irrelevant or undesired consequences of (04). Each of the five, however, is a special case of a sort of action being identical with, or a part of, another sort of action. I will make use in the following discussion of the notion of a completely perspicuous plan, or Plan, for short.2 Informally, I will characterize a Plan as any labelled and dated set of action-types that must be instantiated by a par- ticular agent (whose name is the label) if he is to accomplish a given end while observing given constraints. The discussion of each facet of the Inheritance Principle will specify a different aspect of the notion of a Plan in a somewhat more rigorous way. A Plan, to begin with, is an ordered triple (a, t, P), where a is an agent, t is a time, and P is a set of open sentences whose only unbound variables occupy the agent's place in a predicate of action that is not negated, e.g., 'x walks', '(3y)x eats y', 'x buys the drinks'. I shall call such open sentences 'action- types'. Clauses (iii) through (vii) and (ix) below have the formn 'If 'ox' E P &amp; p, then 'ix' E '. In each such case 'px' will inherit an 'ought' from 'ox', given the truth of 'a ought to O'. So the recursive characterization of P is also a characterization of the Inheritance Principle. (i) If one of the ends of a's action at t is E, then Accomplishes (E) E P. 'Accomplishes' is an operator representing a function that takes ends as ar-</page><page sequence="16">16 BRUCE VERMAZEN guments and has action-types as values. For a given end E, the value of the function is an open sentence that would be true of a if and only if he ac- complished that end. If, for example, one of a's ends is to deal honestly with everyone he meets, 'x deals honestly with everyone x meets' E P. There will perhaps often be more than one such action-type, e.g., 'x deals honestly with everyone a meets', but since the other clauses are designed to bring in these others by recursion on the ones introduced by clauses (i) and (ii), I feel it is simplest to choose an arbitrary action-type true just in virtue of ac- complishing the end and make it the value of the function for that end. I choose the lexically first such action-type. (ii) If one of the constraints on a's action at t is that he is not to ?, then Fails('O') E P. 'Fails' is an operator representing a function from verb phrases headed by unconjugated verbs to action-types. The value for a given verb-phrase is the open sentence obtained from the same verb phrase with 'x fails(s) to' prefixed. For example, for the argument 'tie his shoe' we get 'x fails to tie his shoe'. (i) and (ii) begin a recursive characterization of P. I will discuss ends and con- straints further at the beginning of Chapter V. The first of the five examples of inheritance picks out the case in which we substitute one predicate-expression for another on grounds (as it appears) of co-extensiveness. The example given uses synonyms, but we want also to go from 'You ought to adopt a creature with a heart' to 'You ought to adopt a creature with a kidney' and from 'You ought to vote for Andrew Jackson' to 'You ought to vote for Old Hickory'. In terms of a Plan, complete perspicuity requires that an action should be included in it under whatever description it admits of. We won't want to allow inheritance between every pair of co-extensive predicates, however. Take a case where a predicate in question never was and never will be instantiated, e.g., 'arrive at Bonnie's for dinner on August 9, 1972'. Surely 'I ought to arrive at Bonnie's' etc., does not entail (and is not entailed by) 'I ought to climb Mt. Shasta on my hands'. So sameness of ex- tension by reason of vacuousness doesn't license inheritance. Consider also cases where the sameness of extension is merely accidental. Everyone who has tried to calm Aunt Bea has failed to calm her, and in fact no one will ever try and succeed. But it doesn't seem that if one ought to try to calm her, one ought (except perhaps in the epistimic sense) to fail to calm</page><page sequence="17">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 17 her. As long as we have no reason to think Aunt Bea can't be calmed, the 'ought' isn't inherited. There must be some stronger guarantee of co-exten- siveness than mere fact. My candidate for the appropriate guarantee is physical law. It seems to me that if we knew that 'ox' and 'ix' were possibly non-vacuous and co-exten- sive and that their sameness of extension were guaranteed by physical law - that they would be co-extensive in any state of affairs consistent with physical law - then we would not hesitate to infer 'a ought to 4' from 'a ought to ?' and vice versa. Inheritance by synonymy would be a special case. One might want to treat separately the case where the two predicates are co-extensive because they differ only in containing different but co-referential singular terms, e.g., 'votes for Old Hickory' and 'votes for Andrew Jackson'. Perhaps it is not clear that the truth of 'Old Hickory = Andrew Jackson' is guaranteed by physical law. If not, we can add a subclause about singular terms. This aspect of the IP, then, can be formulated thus, using ' [ ' to mean 'it is physically possible that' and ' f ' to mean 'it is physically necessary that' :3 (iii) (a) If 'ox' eP and e (3x)?x and FP (x)(ix 4ix), then 'px'EEP. (,B) If 'ox' eC and K&gt; (3x) qx and a=j ,and '4x' results from substituting ',B' for 'a' in otherwise referentially transparent contexts of 'ox', then '4'x' E P. This principle will license other substitutions than ones warranted by synonymy and physically necessary co-extensiveness of predicates, of course, but none that are distasteful. It has the consequence that if 'Jones ought to be nice and p', where 'p' is any tautology, is true, so is that sentence with any other tautology substituted for 'p'. That seems clearly irrelevant to the IP, but at least it isn't false. The second sort of case is one where I ought to 4 because I ought to 0 and 4ing is a species of 4ing. It is at least a necessary condition for /ing being a species of 4ing that every 4ing be a 4ing, and that there be some 4ing that is not a ping. A convenient way.to express this relationship between 'Ox' and '4x' would be to talk about the sets of instances of the two. And a convenient way to do that is to adopt Davidson's suggestion in 'The Logical Form of Action Sentences' (loc. cit.) that every verb of action contains an event- variable, that is, an extra place whose arguments are the events that are truly</page><page sequence="18">18 BRUCE VERMAZEN described by the verb. The form, for instance, of 'John walked' is given by '(3x)(Walked(John,x))'. So we may express the necessary condition thus: {e: (3x)4,(x, e)} C {e: (3x)4(x, e)}. Since the inclusion is supposed to be a truth embodied in our way of conceptualizing the world, we may want to strengthen it to this: GS: O ({e: (3x)4(x, e)} C {e: (3x)4i(x, e)}) &amp; {e: (3x)o(x, e)} C {e: (3x)4(x, e)} (The relation-symbol'C' is used in the clause govemed by 'O' since there may be possible worlds in which the only exemplars of the genus are also exemplars of the species.) We can't treat this as a sufficient condition for the genus- species relation since it has the consequence that waltzing or sambaing is a species of dancing, whereas conventional usage would have it that while each is a species, the alternation of the two is not. It also has the consequence that dancing on March 31 is a species of dancing. Farther yet from a true case of genus and species, it entails for arbitrary 'ox' and '4x' that instantiating 'Ox and px' is a species of instantiating 'ox', and that instantiating 'ox' is a species of instantiating 'ox or ix', since necessarily the set of instances of '(3x)(?(x, e) &amp; 4'(x, e))' is included in the set of instances of '(3x)O(x, e)', and necessarily the set of instances of '(3x)O(x, e)' is included in the set of instances of '(3x)(?(x, e) V 4(x, e))'.4 A full account of the genus-species relationship would have to take into account that only predicates with a certain air of generality pick out species or genera. But I feel comfortable using only this necessary condition, since these suspicious cases of species and genus are perfectly acceptable cases of pairs of action-types such that, if one ought to instantiate the species, one ought to instantiate the genus. Indeed, Nozick and Routley attempt to accommodate one of these cases with their I5, viz., 'IaKab', and if an analogue of DeMorgan's laws holds for act-individuals, we could derive 'IAaba', which would accommodate the other case. So I for- mulate this case of inheritance thus: (iv) If 'ox' EP and O({e: (3x)4(x, e)} C {e: (3x)4(x, e)}), then '4xx'l P. (The second conjunct of GS may be omitted here, since there is no harm in admitting'4x' intoPwhere {e: (3x)4(x, e)} = {e: (3x)4,(x, e)}. Presumably such 'ox's will be admitted anyhow by clause (iii).) Cases (3) and (4) invite the comment that what licenses the inheritance is</page><page sequence="19">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 19 just a conditional causal connection, or causal necessity given certain initial conditions. But it is easy to interpret the comment in a way that makes it come out false. Consider the following incautious version of the comment: 'If A is a causally necessary condition of B and both A and B are actions of mine, then if I ought to do B, I ought to do A.' What's wrong with that? Look at a case: 'If my swinging the hammer is a causally necessary condition of my driving the nail in (and they are both actions of mine), then if I ought to do my driving the nail in, I ought to do my swinging of the hammer'. The statement of the case is odd. The last 'then' clause barely gets by as English. But the first 'if clause is worse. The connection claimed between the two actions is not causal, although it obtains in virtue of a causal relation between the first action and another event: the progress of the nail. That is, the fact that my swinging the hammer causes the nail to go in makes it ap- propriate to redescribe my action (swinging the hammer) as my driving the nail in.S But my swinging the hammer doesn't cause my driving the nail in. The 'by' in 'I drove the nail in by swinging the hammer' introduces a new description of the driving, not a causal antecedent of it. How can we state the IP for such cases? Here is a more cautious version: If a ought to 0 and '?(a)' is a description of a's action that is appropriate only if a is and a's 4ing causes some event or other, then a ought to 4. For instance, 'I guillotined John' is appropriate (if and) only if I trip the guillotine and my tripping it causes John to be killed by the blade sliding down the tracks (in the usual way). (I avoid here 'causes John to be guillotined' for the event apparently picked out there as the effect of my tripping is John's being guillotined by someone; since that event is at least partially the same - I would say the same - as my tripping, the latter can't be a cause of the former.) So, if I ought to guillotine John, I ought to trip the guillotine. Two important pieces of background are involved here. To facilitate their statement, I will use Davidsonian event-variables 'e', 'f', 'g' and a predicate 'D' which is read 'does something'. The first bit of background is a meaning- equivalence of this form: &amp;((x)((3e)0(x, e) e (3f, g)(D(x, f) &amp; f causes g &amp; t(g)))). (For example: Necessarily, one shocks a person if and only if one does something that causes that person to enter a state of being shocked.) This is the principle behind Joel Feinberg's 'accordion effect' in its leftward or backward-looking version (see note 5, this chapter). The other bit of background is a conclusion from a knowledge of physical</page><page sequence="20">20 BRUCE VERMAZEN law and the values of the relevant physical parameters at t (a statement of whichis represented by 'T') that (e, f)(D(a, e) &amp; e causesf&amp; t(f) -* (3g)(4 (a, g) &amp; e = g)), that is, that whatever a does that amounts to fing, it will have the character of 4ing. If both bits of background are present, a good plan will include '4 x' if it includes 'Ox'. In terms of the Plan, we get: (v) If 'Ox' E P and O((x)((3e)O(x, e) * (3f g)(D(x, f) &amp; f causes g &amp; (g)))) and, supposing that subsequent to t (3 e, f )((D(a,e)&amp; e causes f &amp; t(f)), we get that Efl T,(3g)(i(a, g) &amp; (e = g))), then '4x' EP. The phrase 'supposing that' introduces a subjunctive element: it doesn't matter whether a ever does something that has the property expressed by 'h'. What matters is what follows given the truth of that supposition. A statement of the supposition is represented by 's'. The intended interpretation of ' [l Ts' is 'it is physically necessary, given T and s, that'. Since the laws governing physical necessity may be deterministic, and since conditions at t could be such that the negation of the supposition will become true subsequent to t, the phrase 'given T and s' can't be interpreted as 'given T U s', or we will be stuck with a self-contradictory set of conditions from which we can derive 'ought'-sentences with arbitrary action-types. We can eliminate this possibility by erasing from T all those sentences such that from them and the laws of nature the negation of s is derivable. So 'given T and s' is to be understood to mean that we are given a set with the relevant erasures made. The result is that the parts of a Plan stemming from applications of (v) will be devised in ignorance of whatever may actually happen that is inconsistent with the occurrence of whatever it is that one ought to do. Because of this feature, even in a deterministic universe, the future is open to an agent figuring out what he ought to do. This seems a desirable feature to incorporate into an account of 'ought'. The same feature is present in clause (vi) below. In the fourth case, again we have a causal prediction coupled with a redes- cription of the accordion-effect sort, but this time rightward or forward- looking. I see that, given the circumstances at t, doing something that I plan to do (k) will have a certain causal consequence; any action having that sort of consequence is describable as 4'ing; so a plan that included everything that must be done given that certain other things are to be done will include 4 if it includes C. In terms of the Plan:</page><page sequence="21">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 21 (vi) If '0x'GP and 0((x)(3e)4(x, e) *(3f,g)(D(x,J)&amp;fcauses g &amp; t(g)))) and, supposing that subsequent to t (3g)(0(a, g) we get that E1 T,(3e)(g causes e &amp; t(e))), then '4ix' EP. One important matter needs to be noted before I go on to the fifth sort of case. There is some controversy, due mainly to Alvin Goldman's book A Theory of Human Action (op. cit.), over the question whether 'hammering' and 'driving the nail in' can be two descriptions of a single action. My thesis in this paper is strongly tied to what Goldman calls 'the identity thesis', roughly, that when I do A by doing B, A and B are the same action. My points could be reformulated in terms of his notion of 'level-generation'; (v) would say that if one ought to ( and can generate a (ing only by king, then one ought to 4; (vi) would say that if one ought to ( and one's (ing will inevitably generate one's iing, then one ought to 4; (iii) would be partly covered by saying that if one ought to ( and (ing results from 4ing by augmentation-generation, then one ought to 4, but there may be cases left over, e.g., where one ought to dance because one ought to waltz, unless we think of waltzing as definitionally equivalent to dancing in just this way ... But since such reformulations would share the vagueness of the notion of level-generation, and since I have already presupposed the Identity Thesis in my criterion for action verbs in Chapter I, I will stick with the Thesis. For some persuasive arguments against Goldman's objections to Davidson, see Norvin Richards, 'E Pluribus Unum: a Defense of Davidson's Individuation of Actions', Philosophical Studies 29 (1976), 191-198. The fifth and final case of 'ought'-inheritance covers those case in which a part of an action ought to be done because the action which includes it ought to be done. The clearest example is one where one ought to ( and (ing is engaging in a process with a prescribed series of steps, each of which is des- cribable by some action-sentence distinct from the one describing the whole process. It follows that one ought to 4, X, etc., where '4, 'X", etc. are the predicates that figure in the description of the steps. But there are other sub- cases I want to include, where doing a whole action involves doing a part of it and where the whole-part relation is not exactly a process-step relation. It would be good here to point out a difference between a Plan and an ordinary plan. The former includes only action-types that the agent must instantiate if he is to accomplish his ends while observing his constraints. The latter would probably include much more; if, for example, an ordinary plan</page><page sequence="22">22 BRUCE VERMAZEN included some action-type that picked out a process, it would probably also include action-types for the steps in the process even if there were several alternative ways of going through the process. A Plan, on the other hand, will only include step-predicates that are not optional; if P includes 'Make an omelet from scratch (x)', it will also include 'Break at least one egg (x)', but not 'Melt some butter (x)', since one could use margarine. It seems to me that 'ought' entailments follow just these same lines. If I ought to make an omelet from scratch, I ought to break an egg, but it's not the case that I ought to use butter unless that follows from some other 'ought'-sentence, e.g., that I ought to make as good an omelet as I can (plus the information that butter is available). The kind of case where the relation of whole to part is not quite that of process to step is illustrated by these examples: if P includes 'Paint this sur- face (x)', it will include 'Paint the left half of this surface (x)'; if 'Raise the glass to your lips (x)', then 'Raise the glass halfway to your lips (x)'; if 'Sit here for ten minutes (x)', then 'Sit here for five minutes (x)'. For each pair, that is, I think that if one ought to instantiate the former, one ought to instantiate the latter. One's intuitions may jar on this point if one reads 'Paint only the left half', 'Raise the glass only halfway', etc., but while that may be the reading intended in the usual employment of these predicates in imperative sentences (which action-types misleadingly resemble) or even in ought-sentences, it is not a reading one must impose. It is misleading to tell someone only that he ought to drink half his milk if you in fact think that he ought to drink it all, but it is nevertheless true that he ought to drink half of it if he ought to drink all of it. It is not easy to characterize these whole-part relations, even for the ap- parently straightforward process-step case. First, there seems to be no good way of picking out which verbs (or verb-centered expressions) are verbs (or expressions) of process. Second, even if one could pick them out, there seems to be no logical relationship that a process bears to its parts that is not also borne by some non-process to a non-part. For example, where 'O' is a process- expression and '4' and 'X' are (indispensable) step-expressions, '(x)(?x i Qx &amp; xx)' and '(x)(0x * 4x and then xx)' are both true, but they are also true of Good Samaritan cases: I help the man (namely John) whom I (subsequently) beat if and only if I help John and (or 'and then') I beat John. Third, it seems not to be a causal or para-causal relationship, for my breaking the eggs is at best only the formal cause of my making the omelet, and my breaking the</page><page sequence="23">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 23 eggs doesn't cause any further event that licenses redescribing the action (or even the whole sequence of steps) as the making of an omelet. Nor does any combination of logical and causal relationships seem promising. Further dif- ficulties arise for the other sorts of whole-part cases. It may seem that 4ing ct will always involve 4ing the parts of et (as in painting surfaces or drinking milk). But I can paint a truck or drive it without painting or driving the car- buretor. Parts of time and distance expressions may seem less problematic, but consider that checking the clock every five minutes for an hour doesn't involve checking it every five minutes for thirty seconds, nor does running a mile involve running an inch. I do not see how to characterize these whole-part relations in any very helpful way, so the formula for this facet of the IP will have less of the ap- pearance of formality than (i)-(vi): (vii) If 'Ox' E P and iing is an indispensable part of 4ing, then ''x' E P. I think that (iii)-(vii) adequately characterize the Inheritance Principle. They are a far cry from (04) and its overcommitment to logical relations. The clauses may have a rather ad hoc appearance, but there is a general characteri- zation that applies to them all: not the transference of 'ought' justified by entailment or inclusion of one action by another, but transference justified by redescription, or in the case of (vii), by partial redescription. The particular way in which an action (or better, a sort of action) is described has no effect on its character as something that ought or ought not to be done. It may be true that we come to know what we ought to do primarily by seeing under what descriptions the actions open to us will fall, but that is a matter of heuristics. What I ought to do, I ought to do no matter what I call it; and I ought to do every part of it. So there is a unity in the collection. But why just these five clauses? (iii) details a sort of redescription that is allowed of any entity. (iv) specifies a sort of conceptually licensed increase in generality that can, again, be introduced into any description. (There is no similar license for an increase in specificity.) (v) and (vi) introduce a warrant for redescrip- tion that applies only to events (if only events have causal relations), and they apply it in both possible temporal directions. And (vii) represents the doing of every part of what I ought to do. The best I can do by way of justification is to say that I am not aware of any grounds for justifying redescription that is not represented here.</page><page sequence="24">24 BRUCE VERMAZEN NOTES TO CHAPTER II X They excuse themselves (loc. cit., 380) from the attempt to accommodate relations between actions like 'physically implies' or 'practically implies', but their treatment is so brief that it is hard to get just what they mean to include. Perhaps I have tried to cover more kinds of cases than they did. 2 My notion of a Plan should not be confused with the notion of an action-plan as ex- plained in Alvin Goldman's A Theory of Human Action, 56-62. The former is a device for assigning a date and an agent to a set of predicates; the latter is a set of desires and beliefs with respect to projected actions of some agent. A Plan is not even a formal-mode mirror of an action-plan, in that it includes only predicates whose instantiation is man- datory if a certain goal is to be-achieved, whereas an action-plan includes beliefs about any actions, mandatory or not, which the agent perhaps wrongly believes would help him achieve his goal. 3 See Chapter III for a fuller characterization. 4 The schemata 'ipx or 4i x' and 'q5x and ipx' need explanation. They give more articu- lation to action-types than was earlier necessary: they stand for action-types made up of two other action-types joined by 'or' or 'and' in a non-elliptical form. The phrase 'in a non-elliptical form' is necessary because I have explained action-types as open sen- tences whose only unbound variables occupy the agent's place in a predicate of action that is not negated. That would seem to allow 'walk or run slowly' to be the English equivalent of an instance of 'qpx or px'. But on one reading 'walk or run slowly' is equivalent to 'walk slowly or run slowly', and where that is the intended reading, I do not want to count 'walk or run slowly' as the English equivalent of an instance of 'Ox or Vpx'. 'In a non-elliptical form' means 'all such standard syntactical ellipses having been eliminated'. It would be a lengthy task to specify the class of such ellipses. 5 This point is made and defended in Joel Feinberg, 'Action and Responsibility', in Max Black (ed.), Philosophy in America (Ithaca, 1965) and Donald Davidson, 'Agency', in R. Binckley et al. (eds.), Agent, Reason and Action (Toronto, 1971). III. SEMANTICAL SCHOLIUM Some of the symbols I have used in characterizing P need explaining if they are to be construed correctly, namely '' [ ', Ts"' 'X', and bound varia- bles 'e', 'f, 'g'. The first three are to be-glossed respectively as 'it is physically necessary that', 'it is physically necessary, given conditions at t and the sup- position that s, that' and 'it is physically possible that'. Their use depends on the supposition that there is a (possibly infinite) set of laws of nature, and that the notion of a complete set of statements of the parameters relevant to these'laws at a given time makes sense. A statement of the form 'rP p' is true if and only if 'p' is derivable from the set of laws of nature. A statement of the form ' nP np' is true if and only if 'p' is derivable from the union of the set of laws of nature and the set of statements of physical parameters at a time t excluding that subset of the latter which contains statements such that from them and the set of laws of nature the negation of 's' is derivable. A</page><page sequence="25">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 25 statement of the form '&lt;t&gt;p' is true if and only if the negation of 'p' is not derivable from the laws of nature. In this connection, we need to hope that there is some equivalent in the language used to express the laws of nature for expressions with essentially intentional or psychological content, such as verbs of action, for otherwise there will be no work for clauses (v) and (vi) to do. Davidson has argued (in 'Mental Events', Experience and Theory (London, 1970), Lawrence Foster and J. W. Swanson (eds.)) that we should not expect to find such equivalents because of the difference between the constraints governing the assignment of physical predicates and those governing the as- signment of physical predicates and those governing the assignment of phychological predicates. I had better say, then, that I use the notion of physical necessity as a way of getting at the idea of what actions one would perform, given that he had performed a certain other (though often 'other' only by description) action: it is an attempted analysis of the subjunctive as employed in these cases. My attempt to say something about 'ought' is independent of this particular analysis of the subjunctive, in that if there is some more adequate analysis of the subjunctive, it can be substituted for the present one without disturbing my claims about 'ought'. 'e', 'f', and 'g' can be understood as variables of quantification that range only over events, while other first-order variables are understood to range over all entities including events. Nothing is lost if expressions like '(3 e)Fe' and '(e)Fe' are read as '(3 x)(x is an event &amp; Fx)' and '(x)(--(x is an event) V Fx)'. I must not give the impression that I consider my theory about the truth- conditions of practical 'ought'-sentences adequate as an analysis of the meaning of these sentences. Once I have outlined the features of a Plan, my statements of truth-conditions will have roughly this form: 'a ought to O' is true if and only if 'ox' is in a's Plan. If we took this as an analysis, it would license us to give as a meaning-revealing paraphrase of a statement like 'Igor ought to leave' a statement like "leaves' is in Igor's Plan'. According to Alonzo Church, however, any purported meaning-analysis is inadequate if translations of some English analysandum p and its English analysans A (p) into some other language L don't convey the same meaning to a speaker of L whom we suppose to be ignorant of English. That is, if T is the English-to-L transla- tion, T(p) must mean the same to the L-speaker as T(A (p)).1 But for p = our sample sentence and L = French, T(p) = 'Igor doit partir' and T(A (p))= ''leaves' est dans le Dessein d'Igor'. So my account can't be an analysis.</page><page sequence="26">26 BRUCE VERMAZEN An account of the truth-conditions of 'ought'-sentences that could double as an analysis of the meaning of 'ought' can be given fairly easily if we allow ourselves to use properties as members of the domain of interpretation. Sup- pose a typical statement of truth-conditions came out like this: 'Igor ought to leave' is true if and only if the property of being a leaving is in Igor's Plan. It is arguable that once the notion of a Plan has been explained to our French speaker, he will get the same meaning from 'Igor doit partir' and 'La qualitSe d'etre un depart est dans le Dessein d'Igor'. At least it doesn't flunk the Church-Langford test as clearly as the approach using English expressions. There is a reason for using properties of actions as members of the Plan in this second version rather than properties of agents. Clauses (iii)-(vii) may be thought of as the beginning of an attempt to answer the question 'Given that a ought to X, what else ought a do?' The answer is gotten by supposing that at some future date a_ s2 and then asking what else will be the case with a's /ing: what must it be coextensive with, what genera will it fall under, what will it amount to and what will amount to it? If we asked instead what would be the case with the agent, we would get the kinds of answers that generate the Good Samaritan Paradox. It may be, for instance, that doing what one ought will unavoidably drive one crazy and that as a result one will murder the Duchess. So if what one would inevitably do given that one did what one ought were also something one ought to do, one ought to murder the Duchess. If instead we consider those properties which an act one ought to do would inevitably have, and only conclude that one ought to do some- thing with those properties - one's actions ought to exemplify those properties - then the question how one ought to treat the Duchess is open. To rewrite the clauses in terms of properties, I will use an actiontype 'D' which is read 'does something'. Upper-case Greek letters 'F', 'W4, etc., are variables for properties. (i) If one of the ends of a's action at t is E, then the property of being an accomplishing of E E P. (ii) If one of the constraints on a's action at t is that he is to do nothing with the property c1, then the property of being a failing to do anything with the property EC P. (iii) If t EC P and Kt ((3e)D(a, e) &amp; e has 1) and Pf (e, f)(D(a, e) &amp; e has 4 D(a,f)&amp;f has T), then I E P. (iv) If F EP and L({e: e has b} C {e: e has T}), then 4 EP.</page><page sequence="27">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 27 (v) If 4 EP and O((x, e)(D(x, e) &amp; e has F e (3f, g)(D(x, f) &amp; f causes g&amp; t(g))) andsupposing thatsubsequent to t (3e, f)((D(a, e) &amp; e causes f&amp; (f)), we get that [f T, (3g)(e = g &amp; g has (F)), then T E P. (vi) If (F EP and O((x, e)(D(x, e) &amp; e has TI + (3 g)(D(x,f) &amp; f causes g &amp; t(g))) and, supposing that subsequent to t (3 e)((D(a, e) &amp; e has (), we get that T] TS(3f)(e causesf&amp; (f))), then I EP. (vii) If (F E P and any action which has (F has a part which is also an action and which has x, then T E P. In clauses (v) and (vi) the subscripted 's' refers to a statement of the supposi- tion contained in the same clause. Clauses (viii) and (ix) below can be re- written similarly, with the role there played by co-instantiability of action- types now played by co-exemplifiability of properties in a set of actions (not by a single action). Something like action-sorts are generated by clauses (i)-(iv): bundles of properties that particular actions could exemplify, but that are none the worse for falling short of including every property an exemplifying action might have. But they aren't needed in the domain of interpretation. These bundles also resemble intentional objects in their fairly robust incompleteness. This approach could be taken as a vindication of the claim that 'ought'-sen- tences express a relation between an agent and an intentional object, where reference to the object is accomplished by mentioning one of its properties; an infinitive phrase 'to O' is taken as a singular term referring to the property of being a 4ing, which mediates the reference to some particular intentional object which has that property. An account of this link between object- language expressions and the 'actions' or 'acts' to which they supposedly refer is lacking in the systems that have variables for 'actions', 'acts', or something like them, e.g., Nozick and Routley's and Castaineda's. There is a big problem lurking in the attempt to make the link in general, however easy it may be to do it on an expression-by-expression basis. Some- how we want a set of axioms that will generate, for arbitrary 'O' and (F, sen- tences like ' 'a ought to O' is true if and only if (F is in a's Plan'. I accept Davidson's stricture3 that a good account of the logical form of a range of sentences should show how the truth-conditions for the whole range can be generated from a finite basis, since presumably the linguistic capacity that the theory may be interpreted as being about has a finite basis. So we can't have</page><page sequence="28">28 BRUCE VERMAZEN a separate clause in the truth-definition for each pair of infinitive and property; we need some sort of device for finding out, given the structure of an infinitive and the links between its parts and the corresponding properties, what pro- perty the infinitive so constructed is linked to. For simplicity, I will suppose that the link is denotation. Then for bare one-verb-only infinitives (of which there are a finite number), we could have clauses like ' 'to O' denotes V; we could even go a little way toward constructing new denotations with clauses like 'For arbitrary 'O' and '4', 'to 0 and 4' denotes the property an object has just in case it has both the property denoted by 'O' and the property denoted by ''", and similarly for 'or' and 'not'. But I am not sure it is reasonable to expect to discover such a constructive method for the infinite number of properties denoted by expressions obtained by putting arbitrary number-expressions for 'n' in the schema 'to P at n miles per hour'. There is no analogous problem for the link between object-language ex- pressions and the object used to interpret them on my approach, for the expressions and the objects are nearly the same, differing only in a way ex- pressible by a rule for changing finite verb phrases to infinitive phrases. It is not a rule I can state, but I doubt that it requires an infinitely long statement. After weighing the failing mark on the Church-Langford test against the difficulties of constructing properties, I have decided to continue using English expression as relata. This way I will get an account of truth-conditions that is not an analysis in Church's sense.

IV. CO-INSTANTIABILITY AND AN ANALOGUE OF PRIOR'S (03) Let me review briefly where we are. A Plan is an ordered triple (a, t, P), where a is an agent, t is a time, and P is a set of open sentences whose un- bound variables are in the agent's place in verb of action (for short, I have</page><page sequence="29">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 29 called such open sentences 'action-types'). P, then, is specified by clauses (i)-(vii) and two further conditions, the first of which I will call the condi- tion of co-instantiability, and the second of which is an analogue of Prior's (03). What we get from (i)-(vii) I will call a putative Plan. Those clauses don't insure against what we might loosely call inconsistency. P won't be inconsis- tent in the sense that for some 'ox' it contains both 'ox' and '-Ox', because (i)- -(vii) have the result that no negated open sentence will occur in it. The exclusion of open sentences with negated predicate-letters may seem odd, since it is usual in standard deontic logics to symbolize sentences like 'Jim ought not to eat' as 'O-Eats(Jim)'. But I do not think that '-Eats(x)' should count as a predicate of action, for it cannot be used to describe any action at all, in that a closure of it wouldn't tell us what anybody did, in the way that a closure of 'Eats(x)' would. Even if we take the notion of describing an action seriously, as proposed by Davidson in 'The Logical Form of Action Sentences' (loc. cit.), and provide an existentially bound variable for the action itself, we can't make it look as if the analysis of 'Jim doesn't eat' is a description of an action. For that analysis would be '-(3x)(Eats(Jim, x))' - roughly, 'There is no event which is one of Jim's eating'; and that, of course, doesn't tell us what anyone did either. Since 'Jim ought not to eat' seems to tell us what someone ought to do, I suggest that the doing involved is failing to eat. For while failing to do (not at doing) something may be a rather attenuated kind of action, it is a kind of action according to the criterion proposed for verbs of action at the end of Chapter I of this essay. For it makes sense to ask of any failure whether it was intentional. I further suggest that 'a ought not to V', where 'V' is a verb of action, is equivalent to 'a ought to fail to V'. As suggested in the discussion of (ii), for the purposes of this paper, we may think of 'fails to 'as an operator F denoting a function that maps verb-phrases or action-types onto action-types. F shares a number of properties with negation, for example those expressed by the following formulae (where the bound variables 't' and 't' range over times): (a) (x)(( 3 t)FG(x, t) *(3 t')'-G(x, t')) (b) (x)(FFG(x) * G(x)) (c) (x)(G(x) V FG(x)) These similarities have led most writers to treat failing-to-act (or whatever the</page><page sequence="30">30 BRUCE VERMAZEN 'not' in 'ought not' indicates) as an analogue of negation; but that is not ap- propriate, since it lacks the crucial property expressed by (d) (x)(FG(x) -+ G(x)) For if I fail to shave on Monday morning and then shave in the afternoon, it is true that I failed to shave (though it is misleading to say so, once the shave is done) and false that I didn't shave. Only if the 'not' in 'ought not' were paraphrasable as 'to fail forever' would (d) express one of its properties; but 'ought never' is the expression we have with all the properties (a)4d). It is tempting to use 'x ought to refrain from fing' rather than 'x ought to fail to 4' as the paraphrase for 'x ought not to O'. Refraining is something like intentional failing, and when you tell someone what he ought to do, or reflect on what you ought to do yourself, you ordinarily envisage the agent doing whatever it is intentionally. But it must be noted that it is not always required that one do it intentionally. If I ought to fall to the ground when the artillery starts, I do what I ought or act as I ought even if I fall unintentionally. The same holds for not-doing. If I ought not to strip in public and go about fully clothed, but without giving any thought to undressing, I am acting as I ought, or not-doing what I ought not. But I am not refraining from stripping, just failing to. So 'refrain', because it entails that the action done in satisfaction of the 'ought' be intentional, is too strong. There is no need for negated predicate-expressions (or Davidson-style action-predicate expressions with a negated quantifier binding the action- variable) in my account, then. The failure operator does the work usually as- signed to 'internal negation', and at the same time preserves the power of 'ought'-sentences to tell us what actions to perform (some of which are failings - or, if intentional, refrainings), rather than introducing (as true negation does) 'ought'-sentences that tell us merely what predicates to have false of us.' We won't be able to call P inconsistent on the grounds that it contains, for some 'ix', both 'ix' and Fails ('ix'), because, for example, some process may involve doing something (for a while) and (then) refraining from doing it (for another while). Inconsistencies will have to involve the presence in P of two action-types that are not both instantiable, and there will be many cases: syntactically obvious inconsistencies like dancing at t and failing to dance at t; inconsistencies due to physical limitations, like being in San Francisco at t and being in Emeryville at t; inconsistencies due to psychological limitations, like giving all your attention to Harriet at t and simultaneously</page><page sequence="31">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 31 giving all of it to Ozzie. It seems to me that there is no satisfactory way of picking out such inconsistencies syntactically. Co-instantiability seems to be a property whose presence in pairs of action-types we can decide given the laws of physics and a translation algorithm from physical-language sentences to the segment of English that contains those action-types. That is a tall (per- haps impossibly tall) order, but it seems to be necessary for complete certainty as to the consistency (in the present sense) of a Plan. Allow me to speak of a Plan as consistent where the set P in it contains no pairs of non-co-instantiable action-types. An effective procedure for determining the consistency of a Plan is clearly out of reach, owing to the potentially infinite size of any P and the consequent infinite number of pairs that would have to be checked for co- instantiability. This doesn't provide me with a reason for reconsidering my decision against using properties in my account, for there is an analogous problem for the approach using properties, viz., the lack of an- effective pro- cedure for deciding which pairs of properties can't both be exemplified by the action of a single agent. Though there is no effective procedure for deter- mining consistency, it is still possible to give a finite statement of the truth- conditions for these sentences; and though it is impossible to decide which of these sentences are true, that is a task I have not set myself. In this way, my proposal reflects the uncertainty of practical deliberation: one can never be quite certain just what one ought to do. At any rate, if the set P in a putative Plan does contain a pair of non-co-instantiable (inconsistent) action- types, it is not a Plan. More briefly, (viii) A triple (a, t, P) is a Plan only if P is consistent. This is a reflection in the theory of the doctrine that 'ought' implies 'can', but only for the case of pairs of actions called for by the ends of and constraints on action. One can still have a Plan in which an action-type occurs that one is simply unable to instantiate. If it is a property of 'ought'-sentences that they are only true of agent-action pairs such that the agent is able to perform the action, my account fails to reflect that property. But it would be easy enough to include it. This necessary condition on a labelled and dated set of action-types being a Plan accommodates an intuition that Prior accommodates with his (02): 'Op -* Pp', that is, 'Op 0 -O p'. I have already rejected occurrences of negated open sentences in a Plan, so the closest I can come to (02) is this: 'If a ought to 0, then it's not the case that a ought to do</page><page sequence="32">32 BRUCE VERMAZEN something that precludes 4ing'. Or, in terms of Plan-membership: if 'Ox' E P, and if 'ox' and '/x' are not co-instantiable by a, then -('ix' E P). So far there is no analogue in this account for Prior's (03): 'O(p -+ q) - (Op -+ Oq)'. I have suggested that it is intended to reflect our intuitions that there are valid arguments of this sort: If a man ought either to lead or not to waltz, then if he ought to waltz, he ought to lead.2 The reason why the argument is valid is not obvious from the surface form of the sentence, however. Consider the following situation as providing the backing for the truth of the first two clauses: agent a has as an end to melt into the crowd early in the Wyoming Waltz Festival and later to make herself known to her confederates (but only to her confederates) by sufficiently bizarre behavior. The only way to melt into this particular crowd is to waltz: hence (I) she ought to waltz. But she has a choice as to behavior bizarre enough to make herself known to her confederates without tipping others off: she can either sit one out or continue to dance, but lead. Hence (II) she ought to lead or not waltz. (Note that (II) is not equivalent to 'She ought to lead or she ought not to waltz'.) With this guarantee of the truth of the premises, there is no temp- tation to move to the conclusion that she ought to lead. To get that sort of conclusion, we need assurance that the waltzing involved in (I) is incompatible with the waltzing involved in (II), and the segmentation of her plan into earlier and later stages precludes any such assurance.3 What we need, to speak in terms of action-types, is the information that the second disjunct of (II) and the action-type in (I) are not co-instantiable, and it should be clear from the preceding discussion that such information is seldom recoverable from the 'ought'-sentence alone. The needed analogue of (03), then, is this: (ix) If 'ox or 4x' EP and 'xx' EP and 'ox' and 'xx' are not co- instantiable, then '4ix' E P. NOTES TO CHAPTER IV 1 My account of 'ought not', if correct, is one reason for rejecting Castanieda's system. He treats 'a ought not to O' as equivalent to 'a ought to fail to O' and further treats 'fail to' (though not explicitly) as if it were an operator N such that (x)(NF(x) -F(x)), so that he is able to generate an analogue of the propositional calculus in the scope of an 'ought-to-do' using the 'not' of 'ought not' as the analogue of negation and prescriptionls as the analogue of propositions. 2 Prior's example is 'When doing one thing without another is forbidden, then if the first thing is obligatory so is the second' (op. cit., 136). My version avoids using 'forbid- den' and 'obligatory'.</page><page sequence="33">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 33 I This is not supposed to be an objection to Prior's formulation. Since 'ought' governs propositions in his system, it would simply be a mistake to formalize the argument in question using the same symbol for 'the agent waltzes (early on)' and 'the agnet waltzes (later)'. V. THE LOGIC OF 'OUGHT' Now that the notion of a Plan has been characterized, one further feature needs to be explained before I can give the truth-conditions for practical 'ought'-sentences. I spoke in (i) and (ii) of the ends and constraints has a has, but that is vague in two crucial ways. First, nothing has been said about cases where an agent has more than one end and can formulate different 'ought'-sentences having to do with the pursuit of these different ends. Second, it may be objected that 'end' here is ambiguous, since sometimes the end in question is just the agent's purpose, whereas in other cases it is some purpose that he doesn't have, but ought to have. Regarding the first of these, it seems to me that practical 'ought'-sentences have an indexical or demonstrative element that works in the following way. When some goal- directed project is part of the context in which a statement is made, the ends and constraints picked out are those that go with that project. For example, if while we are building a house I say 'You ought to use a hammer', I can be understood as telling you that using a hammer will conduce to the end of getting the house built while honoring the constraints imposed on such a project by the usual considerations of efficiency. Such ad hoc ends and constraints are often indicated in speech by clauses accompanying the 'ought'- sentence like 'If you expect to build this house', 'If you hope to please your friend', and 'If you want to make a clean cut'. Compound sentences con- structed with such a clause plus an 'ought'-clause come out puzzlingly false if they are interpreted as making some connection between an expectation, hope, or want that one has and what one ought (absolutely) to do; but they come out true if we suppose merely that the 'if' clause fixes certain features of a Plan and that the 'ought'-clause goes on to report a consequent feature.' The notion of an end here is still vague. It is tempting to identify it with the purpose or desire of the. agent mentioned in the 'ought'-sentence, as Prichard does (see below). Certainly in many cases this identification would not lead us astray. But there are cases where it can be truly said that one ought to do something (call it A) even though one doesn't want, or even wants not, to do A, and even though one doesn't want, or even wants not, to</page><page sequence="34">34 BRUCE VERMAZEN do anything from which A would inherit an 'ought' by the IP. Take the case of a carpenter who is engaged in building a roof. He doesn't want to hammer any nails, he doesn't want to do this job, he is sick and tired of being a car- penter, and he cares nothing for honoring contracts. He wants with all his heart to be home in bed, yet through self-control (or perhaps weakness of will), there he is, engaged in building the roof. Perhaps in the degenerate sense of 'want' in which one wants to do anything that one does intentionally, he wants to hammer nails, for he is hammering them intentionally. But I think that sufficient grounds for saying that he is doing it intentionally are provided by the information that he is doing it knowingly and accepting the actions as his and that he is not acting under psychological compulsion, hypnotic influence, or other unusual coercive conditions - that is, he is both ready and in a legitimate position to accept responsibility for his actions and their reasonably foreseeable consequences, which covers also responsibility for the actions under all reasonably foreseeable descriptions that may come to apply to them. So despite any real wanting or acts of intending on his part, there is something he's doing, and it is in that sense that he has an end. Although there is no identifiable mental episode of intending on the part of our carpenter, this is the sort of situation in which we ascribe to him an intention to do what he is doing. I will say, then, that what these first two cases have in common is that the end which licenses the 'ought'-sentences is just the agent's intention. If his intention is to 0, then his end is to b. There is a third kind of case in which it seems we use 'ought'-sentences that have to do with what someone would do if he had a certain intention which we think he ought to have, and where our thinking so results from our assigning him some r6le or capacity, such as that of a carpenter or a shoemaker. The busboy can say, 'He's the waiter. He ought to bring you coffee, not I', even if the waiter in question would rather not bring your coffee or do anything that would entail (via the IP) bringing your coffee, and further has no intention of bringing it. But because he is a waiter, we feel justified in saying he ought to do an assortment of waiterly tasks. This fits into the scheme I have introduced if we suppose that one of this person's ends (insofar as he is a waiter) is constituted by the intentions a waiter ought to have. This does not result in a circle in definition (or even in truth-conditions), since having intentions is not a kind of action. The 'ought' here is the ideal 'ought'. My claim is that we have ideals for the intentions of various classes of agents</page><page sequence="35">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 35 and that these ideals are the grounding for some of our assertions of practical 'ought '-sentences. The difficulty exemplified by the Good Samaritan Paradox shows why we can't just say that we have an ideal for the actions of (e.g.) waiters, and that it is this ideal which is expressed in what I singled out as practical 'ought'- sentences. If we say that a waiter ideally removes the soup with the Salmonella, it seems we must gloss that either as 'ideally (the waiter removes the soup with the Salmonella)' or 'ideally (if the soup has Salmonella, the waiter removes it)' or 'if the soup has Salmonella, then ideally (the waiter removes it)'. On any of these glosses, there seems to be contaminated soup in the ideal world of waiters. The difficulty doesn't arise if we suppose that the relevant ideal has to do only with intentions. A most important subset of this third kind of case includes all those ideals for intentions that apply to all persons at all times: the ideals we have for in- tentions of agents qua agents. For convenience I will refer to the ends and constraints so constituted as the ends of and the constraints on action. The supposition that there are such ideals, and that it is they we indicate when we assert an 'ought'-sentence that says what someone ought morally to do, would explain why moral 'ought'-sentences have the characteristic of universali- zability that R. M. Hare has written about. We are notoriously uncertain and often at odds about just what the ends of and constraints on action are, but I think that the moral use of 'ought' presupposes that there are some such ends and constraints. Understanding someone else's assertion of an 'ought'- sentence not dependent on someone's intentions or r6le involves understanding what he takes the ends of action to be. The question whether one has such ends is the question whether one ought categorically to do anything at all, on my account. To summarize: a's end is to p if and only if either it is a's intention to 4 or it ought (in the ideal sense) to be a's intention to 4. 'End' here is a term of art tailored to my needs in giving truth-conditions for practical 'ought'- sentences. Is it ambiguous? I am not sure the answer matters. It would matter if the line of division between senses of 'end' matched the most familiar line of division between the 'oughts' I am attempting to explain: the line between technical (or non-moral) and moral 'oughts'. That line has traditionally been taken to mark an ambiguity. (See my discussion of Prichard in Chapter VII below.) But technical 'oughts' are a mixed lot with respect to the real or ideal origins of the ends that validate them. The line passes through the wrong</page><page sequence="36">36 BRUCE VERMAZEN territory. So there seems to be no motivation to decide between describing the situation as one in which 'end' is ambiguous or one in which there are two different ways to back up a (univocal) claim that one has an end. I call the use of 'ought' that applies to everyone regardless of intentions and r6les the moral use2 (and call the more restricted use the technical use), but it doesn't have two characteristics sometimes thought essential to the use of 'ought' in moral contexts: it isn't prescriptive in Hare's sense (for which see below) and it isn't overriding. It would be prescriptive if my assertion of 'a ought to O' were true only if I were somehow committed to getting a to k. It would be overriding if an 'ought'-sentence validated by reference to the ends of action3 somehow made false any 'ought'-sentence that was validated by reference to a non-universal end and that was impossible to follow while fol- lowing the moral 'ought'-sentence. I want to leave the question of the overridingness of certain 'ought'-sentences aside, as a matter of moral disagreement rather than linguistic settlement. This creates a problem for my proposal. Since it could happen that I ought to use a hammer at t as a consequence of some project I am engaged in, but ought not to use it at t in the context of the ends of and constraints on action (e.g. when it isn't my hammer), an inconsistency of the kind discussed above arises in my putative Plan, and it is disqualified as a genuine Plan. I want both 'ought'-sentences to come out true, however, so I will add this refine- ment. For each set of ends and constraints relevant to a, we will generate a separate Pi, where 'i' indicates which set of ends and constraints is in question by reference to the intention of the speaker. Allow me to extend my earlier convention making "Ox' is in a's Plan' mean the same as '"'x' E P in (a, t, PY' in such a way that "Ox' is in a's Plani at t' will mean the same as "Ox' E Pi in (a, t, Pi )'. We can then state the satis- faction-conditions for a formal-language counterpart of the English practical 'ought' thus: Let 0 be the set of all sequences (x, y, z) such that x is an agent, y is a time, z is an action-type, and (3 i)(z is in x's Plani at y). 'Ought' is that three- place predicate which is satisfied by all and only members of 0. This clause in the definition of satisfaction for a formal-language counterpart of English al- lows us to generate theorems giving the truth-conditions for arbitrary practical- 'ought'-sentences of English and its formal counterpart. No doubt this will be a difficult undertaking, but for many sentences the translation is quite straight-forward, e.g. 'Ought (John, now, 'act quickly')' translates into 'John</page><page sequence="37">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 37 ought to act quickly'. The form of the theorems generated (where, for sim- plicity, the name, time, and action-type are specified) will be this: 'a ought to O' is true at t if and only if (a, t, '`x') E 0. Given the conditions imposed on 0, this entails a formula that is easier to grasp and test against one's intuitions, namely: 'a ought to O' is true at t if and only if there is some i such that 'ox' is in a's Plani at t. The satisfaction- and truth-conditions for practical 'ought not'-sentences are in effect contained within those for practical 'ought'-sentences, for the former can be treated as mere surface transformations of that subset of the latter where the action-type in question is a value of the failing function. At first glance, it may seem that we have easy access to an account of the truth-conditions of perfect-aspect 'ought'- and 'ought not'-sentences, such as 'Jones ought to have eaten', roughly indicated by the claim that 'a ought to have Od' is true at t if and only if there is some time earlier than t at which 'a ought to 4' was true, and similarly for 'ought not' and 'ought not to have'. This won't work4 because it may be in Stan's Plan of April 2 to sleep late on April 4 but not on any earlier morning. Then even though it's true on April 3 that on April 2 it was true that Stan ought to sleep late (some morning or other), it is not true (on April 3) that Stan ought to have slept late. So in stating truth conditions for perfect-aspect 'ought'-sentences, we must at least consider the relationship between the date of utterance of the 'ought to have'- sentence and the date of the proposed action. But there is even a further com- plication. Suppose it is in Stan's Plan on April 5 to drive to San Diego on April 6. We won't be able to say truly 'Stan ought to have driven to San Diego' until the last moment possible for him to have completed the trip is past. Before that, but after the last moment for beginning a complete trip, the best we could manage would be 'Stan ought to be driving to San Diego'. That is, the time-relationship crucial for the truth of such a sentence is not just that between the date of its utterance and the date of the proposed action, but between the former date and the last date of completion of the proposed action compatible with accomplishing the agent's ends. Further, there is a dif- ference between perfect-aspect 'oughts' about undone actions and those about actions done: 'I ought to have 4d' is true in a case where I did 4 as soon</page><page sequence="38">38 BRUCE VERMAZEN as I have finished /ing, even thought the last date of completion compatible with achieving my ends has not yet passed.5 Since the action-types themselves are not dated, my account will not yield truth-conditions for perfect-aspect or progressive-aspect 'ought'-sentences. For straightforward practical 'ought'-sentences, my proposal is briefly this: the practical 'ought' can be understood as a triadic predicate of persons, open sentences, and times. The characterization of a Plan is at the same time a characterization of the function that generates the set of sequences that satisfy 'ought' in its practical sense, or the set of ordered pairs of which 'ought' is true at t. A detailed treatment of quantified practical 'ought'- sentences would follow the same lines as a treatment of any quantified first- order sentences containing triadic predicates. The formal semantics is simple, though the function generating the extension of 'ought' is complicated. A proposal similar to mine has been sketched by Gilbert Harman in 'Moral Relativism Defended' (loc. cit.). A comparison of the two will bring forward in a perhaps clearer way the salient features and, I hope, the relative advantages of mine. His proposal does not straightforwardly concern the class of 'ought'- sentences I have identified but rather the subclass obtained (on my account) by derivation from the ends of and constraints on action, and excluding those sentences that are not used in a certain way, viz. to make what he calls 'inner judgments'. These judgments have two important characteristics. First, they imply that the agent has reasons to do something. Second, the speaker in some sense endorses these reasons and supposes that the audience also endorses them (8). But though his thesis is thus one about sentences-in-use rather than simply sentences, there is some suggestion that it has wider application to practical 'ought'-sentences, since 'ought'-sentences issued in situations where the first or second condition on inner judgment is not satisfied may be regarded as an 'inverted-commas' use of 'ought', and hence as cases of pretence of making true inner judgments (1 1). He maintains that the 'ought' so isolated is a four-place predicate (or 'operator'), 'Ought (A, D, C, M)', which relates an agent A, a type of act D, considerations C, and motivating attitudes M (10), 'and that 'Ought (A, D, C, M)' means roughly that, given that A has motivating attitudes M and given C, D is the course of action for A that is supported by the best reasons (11). Harman does not explain his notion of a type of act or course of action, so</page><page sequence="39">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 39 that it is unclear what the relationship is between the denotatum of 'D' and the infinitive phrase that appears in the inner judgment. The phrase could either pick out the type completely or pick out a mere aspect of some very complex type. The expression 'type of act' suggests the former alternative, the expression 'course of action' the latter. The notion of considerations is also left rather obscure, though it is exemplified by the sorts of clauses one encounters in talk about prima facie obligations; e.g. in 'Considering that you promised, you ought to go', the clause 'that you promised' somehow indicates a consideration (10).. Motivating attitudes appear as a relatum because of Harman's view that "If S says that (morally) A ought to do D, S implies that A has reasons to do D which S endorses" and his view "that such reasons would have their source in goals, desires, or intentions that S takes A to have" (9). 'M' stands for those of A's intentions relevant to his having reasons for doing D. The first important difference between Harman's account and mine is that I do not restrict my account to inner judgments. Harman's reason for the res- triction seems to me unsound. He develops a series of examples to show that, when an agent is not thought by the speaker to be capable of being motivated by reasons that support course of action D, the speaker will not say of him that he ought to do D unless the speaker is pretending that the agent is so capable. But the examples (5)-(8) are unconvincing. To take the strongest one, Harman maintains that "it sounds odd to say that Hitler should not [hence, according to Harman, ought not to] have ordered the extermination of the Jews", because the judgment is "too weak" (7). The oddity, Harman claims in connection with other examples, is due to a misuse of language, specifically the non-satisfaction of the first condition on inner judgments. But an equally appealing diagnosis of the oddity, to my ear, is that while 'Hitler ought not to have ordered the extermination of the Jews' is true, Hitler's crime is so monstrous that it is almost indecent to condemn it in terms so mild. The same oddity (insofar as we can hear such things reliably) would be present if I said to a man who was susceptible to the relevant moral considera- tions, but who was just about to stab an infant, 'You ought not to stab that infant'. Here too, the judgment is true, but far less than what the occasion calls for. This difference is very strongly tied to the difference that there is no counterpart of M among the relata I propose. It seems clear that we often say of people that they have reason to do so and so even when we know that they have no attitudes that would motivate them to do it. The heroin addict has</page><page sequence="40">40 BRUCE VERMAZEN reason to give up his habit, we say, because we have certain ideals of human freedom which apply to him regardless of the sad state his desires and ideals for himself may have fallen into. And just as we can say (in a sense unacknowl- edged or perhaps rejected by Harman) that unmotivated people have reasons to do so and so, we can say that they ought to do so and so. It may be false or pointless for the missionary to say that the contented heathen ought to accept Christ, but it is not a misuse of language nor does it necessarily involve a pretence about their motivations. M's r6le is somehow to determine what, given the circumstances, A is to do. This role in my account is occupied by the ends and constraints picked out by the Plan-index i. The index could easily have been counted as one of the relata, but since there is no counterpart for it in the surface form of the sentences it is used to explicate, I chose to put it off to the side. The ends and constraints are some of them M-like, as per the discussion at the beginning of the present chapter, but some of them not. There is also no counterpart to C among my relata. The sentences I am concemed with are ones of the form 'a ought to O', and it seems to me that there is no 'relativity to considerations' present in such sentences, that is, that their truth or falsity is always judged with reference to all the circumstances that bear on what actions will accomplish the ends envisaged by the speaker. The function I have specified attempts to show exactly how the circumstances bear on the action. For an account of the truth-conditions of a complex sen- tence like 'Considering that (or insofar as) you promised, you ought to go', we will need something like Harman's 'considerations'. But they will bear on the interpretation of the 'ought'-clause only indirectly, in this way: such a sentence can be understood to mean 'If you suppose that the only end you have is keeping your promises, you ought to go'. That is, statements of pima facie obligation (of this sort) ask the hearer to imagine a state of affairs simpler than the actual one, with respect either to the ends one has or to the circumstances one finds oneself in, and then states what 'ought'-sentence would be true in that state of affairs. So the semantic r6le of 'considerations' lies in setting up these contrary-to-fact states of affairs, not in determining the truth of the subsequently issued 'ought'-sentence. I will say more about statements of prima facie obligation in Chapter VI. Harman doesn't consider the r6le of the time of utterance of the 'ought'- sentence in his account, but clearly it is important, since an 'ought'-sentence could be true now but false later, when I have done what I ought, or when it</page><page sequence="41">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 41 is too late to do what I ought to have done, or when someone has graciously (or otherwise) taken the responsibility off my hands. The final, and most important, difference is that my account makes ex- plicit what the relationship is between the trio of relata and the surface form of the 'ought'-sentence to whose truth they are collectively relevant, while the crucial notion of a course of action being supported by the best reasons is left completely unexplained by Harman. The two accounts resemble each other much less than they might at first seem to. It remains to show that none of the woes of traditlonal deontic logic afflict my proposal. Two of them, viz. the inability to accommodate arguments like the ones in examples (3) and (4) at the beginning of Chapter II and the Good Samaritan Paradox, have been dispelled in the discussion of the IP. Clauses (v) and (vi) explicitly accommodate the problematic arguments, and there is no equivalent of Prior's (04) to generate the Paradox. It may be thought that (vii) affords the possibility of a version of the Good Samaritan Paradox. In a way, every accomplishing of an end can be seen as engaging in and completing a process, given that the agent is not initially in a position to accomplish the end. The process is this: first he puts himself in a position to accomplish the end, then he accomplishes it. So by (vii), where a is not in a position to 0, 'ought' is inherited by 'a puts himself in a position to O' where 'a ought to O' is true. Now consider a case in which one ought to make reparations for some misdeed of one's own. Since one is not in a position (logically) to make reparations unless one has done the misdeed, it seems to follow that one ought to do the misdeed. It doesn't follow, however, because of the time relatum. 'a ought to make reparations' only becomes true when the misdeed has already been done: even if I can foresee doing evil to someone, it is not now true that I ought to make reparations, though it is true that I ought to make reparations when the time comes and that it will be the case that I ought to make reparations. So by the time a ought to make reparations, he is already in a position to make them, and nothing follows with regard to whether he ought to do the misdeed.6 Substitution of singular terms on the strength of non-modalized identity statements is taken care of in two ways. Where the singular term in question occurs inside an action-type, clause (iii) licenses the substitution: shaking hands with the Velvet Fog is co-extensive with shaking hands with Mel Torme. Where the singular term is the one picking out the agent, the substitu- tion is licensed by the fact that in clauses (i)-(ix), 'a' occurs only in exten-</page><page sequence="42">42 BRUCE VERMAZEN sional contexts, so that if something is in a's Plan and a = b, that same thing will be in b's Plan. The inference I used to present Hintikka's system with a dilemma goes through in a somewhat modified form. If the truth of 'Billy ought to draw' is guaranteed by the same Plani as the truth of 'Billy ought to shoot', then 'Billy ought to draw and shoot' is also true; but the inference is not licensed if the two 'oughts' depend on different Plans for their truth. The latter sort of inference is not excluded, however, so if we want such inferences we can augment the satisfaction-conditions so as to provide for the compound- ing of action-types drawn from different Plans. Such compounding seems to be allowed in ordinary speech. Presumably going to bed at a certain time is intended to achieve physical well-being, whereas religious exercises are aimed at welfare in the hereafter, but there is nothing odd about saying, 'You ought to go to bed and say your prayers', even if the speaker believes the two ends to be independent. The difficulty with the argument reconstructed in Hintikka's way was that it split Billy up into different individuals, one of whom ought to draw, the other of whom ought to shoot. It is just one instance of a general problem about the behavior of singular terms in modal contexts; in my treat- ment, singular terms behave as they do in non-modal contexts. Finally, since the range of 'ought'-sentences dealt with by my proposal is restricted to ones of the form agent-'ought'-action-type, there are no true practical 'ought'-sentences that traditional deontic logics were led to symbolize as 'Ot' where 't' is a tautology. The practical 'ought' is not even the right part of speech to figure in such a sentence as 'It ought to be the case that p or not-p'. I could summarize my project by saying that I have taken features that technical 'ought'-sentences fairly clearly have and attempted to show a way in which moral or categorical 'ought'-sentences may be seen to have just the same features, the difference residing only in a different index of ends. One objection to this assimilation is that some speakers feel that 'morally ought' applies to actions only under certain descriptions. Imagine, for instance, a situation in which a baby is about to be attacked by a mad bishop; the only way to stop the attack is to immobilize the attacker; and the only way to immobilize him is to shoot him. The speakers in question would allow that in such circumstances one could derive from (i) 'I ought to save the baby' such other sentences as (ii) 'I ought to immobilize the bishop' and (iii) 'I ought to shoot the bishop', but only if the 'ought' is understood as a practical 'ought' that is not the (or a) moral 'ought'. If the 'ought' is taken as the moral 'ought',</page><page sequence="43">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 43 (i) is true, but not (ii) or (iii). I do not feel the force of this objection, but I think the uneasiness of these speakers may be due to the degree to which (i)- (iii) suggest the moral principle (or statement of end) from which, together with a statement of the circumstances, they are derived. (i') 'I morally ought to save the baby' sounds all right because it suggests that the principle in- volved is something like 'Everyone morally ought to save babies'. (iii') 'I morally ought to shoot the bishop' sounds bad because it suggests a murderous anti-clericalism, or at least fails to suggest that it derives from a principle concerning the protection, rather than the destruction, of life. If an explana- tion of the circumstances and a clarification of the end or principle involved is given, I do not see on what grounds one could object to (iii') and sentences like it. A stronger objection to the assimilation of the moral 'ought' to the practical 'ought' comes from another quarter. The way some speakers, and perhaps fairly many speakers, use 'ought' may furnish grounds for saying that there is a special moral 'ought' and that it has moral content in a way that the 'oughts' I have given an account of do not. For these people, a sentence like 'One ought not to lie', with the 'ought' understood in this special sense, is analytically true, as are a number of other very-high-level precepts. Other true but now contingent sentences might follow from this in the way indicated by my clauses (iii)-(vii) and (ix), e.g. given the information that if Richard is not to lie, he must not speak, it would follow that Richard ought not to speak. So not all true moral 'ought'-sentences would be analytic, but some of them would. The difference in sense from the practical 'ought' as I have outlined it would consist in the substitution of the supposed analytic 'ought'- sentences for my clauses (i) and (ii), and possibly also the deletion of clause (viii) (concerning co-instantiability), since a list of analytic 'ought'-sentences of any considerable length would probably lead to conflicts in practice. How could one distinguish such speakers from those who merely have a very firm idea of what the ends of and constraints on action are, but who use 'ought' in the way I have outlined in this essay? Maybe the distinction would emerge as a matter of style of argument, viz. whether, when pushed, the speaker insists that one just ought to do such and such, period, or whether he makes a further move and says that's the way a person ought to be, or that's the way a truly moral person or truly good person acts. If the latter moves are conceived of as substantive, i.e. as not simple profferings of synomyms, then they can be understood as ways of getting at ultimate ends</page><page sequence="44">44 BRUCE VERMAZEN and constraints. Clearly they are not remarks about the meaning of 'ought'. The first sort of speaker might rightly be counted as one for whom some 'ought'-sentences had intrinsic content, whereas others - ordinary technical 'oughts' - picked up their content from the context of utterance. We could generate the same set of 'ought'-sentences that were held true by such a speaker if we took at action-types in his analytically true 'ought'- sentences, counted them as the accomplishing of ends and honoring of con- straints, and generated a Plan. But though this would make my account adequate extensionally to this person's speech, it would be untrue to the spirit of what he was saying. Perhaps then my account should be looked at partly as a proposal for a reform of language and not merely a theory about the current use of language. Grounds for the reform are that we're never going to agree about ends and constraints anyway, so that there is no point in speaking as if they were implicit in the language we use. I think, however, that for typical speakers of the language, my account is correct. NOTES TO CHAPTER V 1 R. M. Hare noted in The Language of Morals, 34, that 'want' in such contexts does not mean 'be affected by a recognizable state of the feelings known as desire', but he goes on to claim that it is a logical term signalling an imperative inside a subordinate clause. 2 This is an artificially narrow scope to give to the word 'moral', since some of what it is generally thought one morally ought to do devolves upon the agent in virtue of some r6le he occupies, e.g. parent or citizen. But since I put no weight on this notion of the moral use in what follows, I should like to excuse myself from the task of sorting out those r6les that create moral 'oughts' from those that create merely technical ones. 3 I thus further abbreviate 'the ends of and constraints on action', since it doesn't seem to matter much whether something is called an end or a constraint. 4 This problem was pointed out to me by Alan Walworth. This difference was pointed out to me by Nancy Davis. 6 The kernel of this reply was suggested to me by Michael Seidman. VI. PRIMA FACIE 'OUGHTS' So far, very little has been said about the 'oughts' that figure in sentences like 'Emily ought prima facie to tell the truth', even though this has been treated by some writers as a distinct problem. The notion of a prima facie 'ought' or of prima facie obligations or duties is much used by moral philosophers since Sir David Ross introduced the term 'prima facie duty' (if not exactly the notion that now goes with the term, as I shall argue) in</page><page sequence="45">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 45 The Right and the Good (Oxford, 1930). For example, it figures very prominently in John Searle's paper 'How to Derive Ought from Is' (Phil. Rev. 73 (1964), 43-58) and the subsequent controversy, and in William Frankena's popular introductory text, Ethics (Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1963; 2d ed., 1973). The expression, as used by Searle, Frankena, and other recent writers, fills a genuine gap in discourse about moral deliberation and decision. The picture of deliberation it goes with is this: one has a bunch of moral rules or knows that there are a number of features of action relevant to their rightness or wrongness, or (in my case) thinks of one's prospective actions in terms of their relevance to the accomplishing of one or other of a number of ends. One then takes the rules, features, or ends one by one and figures out what it would turn out one ought to do if this single end (rule, feature) were the only end (rule, feature) one had to worry about. Say the action turns out to be ping. Here Searle or Frankena would say 'I ought prima facie to 0'. Then after one has gone through the whole set of ends (rules, features) one by one and derived a prima facie 'ought'-sentence for each one that applies at all, one surveys the array and somehow comes up with a decision as to what one ought absolutely or actually to do, perhaps by assigning weights to the prima facie 'oughts' according to which rule they were derived from, perhaps by adopting 'the moral point of view' (so Frankena, 2d ed., 53). But while 'prima facie ought' does fill this gap, it seems to me preferable to use clumsier but more explicit locutions like 'Insofar (and insofar only) as you promised to X, you ought to O' or 'If the only morally relevant feature of your proposed Oing were that it was the keeping of a promise, then it would be the case that you ought to O'. There are two reasons why. First, the phrase 'prima facie ought' looks misleadingly as if it were an application of 'prima facie' to 'ought'. And second the phrase is often linked historically to Ross's notion of prima facie duty, but really picks out a rather different concept; and since it seems to me that Ross's notion is the more important, I prefer to reserve the expression for it. Regarding the first reason, what one does to arrive at a prima facie 'ought' is to ignore enough features of the decision-making situation that only a single rule or end is applicable to it. But 'prima facie', after all, means something like 'on the face of it', and a report based on squinting at one aspect of a situation isn't likely to be a report that tells you what the situation is like on the face of it. I can assert a prima facie 'ought'-sentence of the sort discussed by Searle, Frankena, Hintikka, and Castafieda when there is no case for saying</page><page sequence="46">46 BRUCE VERMAZEN that what 'prima facie' ought to be done really ought to be done, except the sort of 'case' that can be made by ignoring most of the known facts. That isn't what a prima facie case is in the law, where all the established facts must be accommodated, and it isn't what would ordinarily be meant by a non- lawyer who said 'Prima facie, you ought to such-and-such'; the non-lawyer would mean 'Here's what it looks like you ought to do: such-and-such.' So the meaning of 'prima facie ought' is not a simple function of the meanings of 'prima facie' and 'ought'. The justification for the label is really to be sought in history: its use is similar to the use to which Ross put the expression 'prima facie duty'. The similarity is only superficial, however. I will try to substantiate this charge by looking closely first at the reconstructions of the notion 'prima facie ought' offered by Hintikka and Castaineda and then at Ross's remarks in The Right and the Good. I will pay particular attention to the way in which each writer allows the inheritance of an 'ought' or duty, since the dis- crepancies between Hintikka and Castanleda, on the one hand, and Ross, on the other, reveal a difference between the bearers of the attributes represented by the two expressions. Of the deontic logicians I have so far discussed, Kanger, Prior, Anderson, Nozick, and Routley do not address themselves to the prima facie 'ought'. The last few pages of Hintikka's paper 'Deontic Logic and its Philosophical Morals' (loc. cit.) are devoted to reconstruction within his deontic calculus of the distinction between prima facie duties or obligations and absolute or actual duties or obligations. Hintikka conducts most of his discussion in terms of obligation, but throughout the article he treats 'It is obligatory that F(a)', 'a is under an obligation to F' and 'a ought to F' as if they meant pretty much the same thing; and when he applies his reconstructed distinction to Searle's 'How to Derive Ought from Is', he equates prima facie obligations and prima facie 'oughts' in several places (e.g. 21 1). (Searle also writes as if the two notions were the same.) So it is not unfair to take his remarks on prima facie obligation as if they were about whatever it is that is expressed by 'prima facie ought'. Castaileda's axioms for deontic logic in 'On the Semantics of the Ought-to- do' (loc. cit.) contain different subsets of axioms for an overriding 'ought' and prima facie 'oughts'. The difference lies in a single axiom which has it that any overriding 'ought'-sentence entails the corresponding prescription (which is the common proposition-like core of "commands, order, petitions,</page><page sequence="47">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 47 requests, pieces of advice, entreaties, and suggestions" (678)), whereas a prima facie 'ought'-sentence to k only entails that it's not the case that one ought prima facie to not-@. (Not-1ing is something like the action one would do to obey the order 'Don't O'.) Further, each prima facie 'ought' is indexed to show that it is only with respect to a certain context that the 'ought' in question holds; that is, to use Castafieda's terminology, it is only with respect to certain norms, rules, customs, etc. that the prescription is endorsed, and the index tells us which. The set of prescriptions endorsed in a given context is consistent, though there may be pairs of prescriptions endorsed in different contexts that are inconsistent with one another. Hintikka's reconstruction of the distinction goes like this: .. let us consider some set of normative principles whose conjunction is n ... Let us also assume that we have as our factual premises a set of descriptive statements whose conjunction is p. Then we shall say that on the basis of the set of norms n, q is a prima facie obligation if and only if (41) O[(n &amp;p)-ql is valid ... (204). The reconstruction is unsatisfactory as it stands, since 'O [(n &amp; p) -* p]' is valid, i.e. since 'P((n &amp; p) &amp; -p)' is not satisfiable owing to the impossibility of constructing a consistent model set containing it as a member. As a result, the conjunction of all the factual premises, as well as any conjunct that it might be broken down into, is prima facie obligatory. If we get a prima facie obligation (of Hintikka's sort) to keep a promise from our having made the promise, we also get a prima facie obligation to make (or perhaps to have made) the promise. And if one of the relevant factual premises is 'It is now Tuesday', then it is prima facie obligatory that it is now Tuesday. (It is also unsatisfactory to have propositions or truth-values be prima facie obligations, a position suggested by Hintikka's use of 'q' as a referring expression.) This group of unsatisfactory features, however, interests me less than the way in which Hintikka allowsprima facie 'oughts' to be inherited. In discussing a particular case of prima facie obligation, Hintikka says I give an honest promise (let this act be described by p) to bring it about that q (say, have a cup of coffee with you) (203). Later in the same example, the interpretation of q changes in an interesting way: For the fact that the obligation created by my promise is overruled means that it is false to say simpliciter that Oq, i.e. that I am obliged to fulfill this promise.</page><page sequence="48">48 BRUCE VERMAZEN In order to interpret this explanation coherently, one must suppose that Hintikka thinks that to some degree the Inheritance Principle holds for prima facie 'oughts', that is, that one can go from 'Prima facie I ought to keep my promise' and 'In order to keep my promise, I must have a cup of coffee with you' to 'Prima facie I ought to have a cup of coffee with you'. The claim that Hintikka sanctions inheritance can be made on firmer grounds if we assume that the following situation is possible: let the relevant norm have the form 'O(p -+ q)' (e.g. 'It ought to be the case that if John promises then John keeps his promise'); let the relevant circumstances be described by 'p', 'r', and 'r -* (q e+ s)' (e.g. 'In these circumstances, John keeps his promise if and only if John has a cup of coffee'). By Hintikka's account, John will have a prima facie obligation to have a cup of coffee in case 'O((O(p -+ q) &amp; p &amp; r &amp; (r -+ (q ** s))) -+ s)' is valid, and it is. (See Appendix for proof.) It is a little harder to show that Castanieda also allows the inheritance of prima facie 'oughts', but at least he seems to be committed to saying that if Joe ought prima facie to 0 and if 'Joe Os -* Joe 4s' is a theorem of the proposi- tional calculus, then Joe ought prima facie to 4.1 It follows that there is at least enough of the IP to go from 'Joe ought prima facie to O' to 'Joe ought prima facie to k or s,.2 We can get a stronger result by noticing that in his discussion of the endorsement of prescriptions he remarks, It may be also said that we endorse the prescriptions which demand the doing of actions that are necessary for the attainment of the goals or ends we pursue (693) for that could be taken as a way of summarizing the whole IP. Then '01 (A) &amp; 01 (A -+ B)' would describe a situation in which (first clause) some prescrip- tion is endorsed and (second clause) an instance of the IP for that prescrip- tion is also endorsed. By Castafieda's axiom (03), '01 (A &amp; (A -* B))' follows, and since '(p &amp; (p -* q)) -+q' is a theorem of the propositional calculus, '01 (B)' follows by his rule DRI. So if the index 'i' is taken to refer to the sort of res- tricted context of endorsement that backs up a prima facie 'ought', we get inheritance of a prima facie 'ought'. For both Hintikka and Castafieda, there are two elements that determine whether or not one prima facie ought to do something: the norms (or rules, customs, etc.) that apply to that sort of action and the circumstances in which one finds oneself. But not all the norms that apply need be counted in. In both cases I can squint, as it were, and only consider one or two norms,</page><page sequence="49">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 49 e.g. the one that says I ought to keep promises. If it turns out, on considering just that norm and the circumstances relevant to applying it, that I ought to 0, then it is true to say that I ought prima facie to /. If we suppose that there are norms pertaining to every sort of goal-directed project, this might be an approximate account of how technical 'ought'-sentences work. That is, instead of assuming, as I have, that such 'ought'-sentences are verified by reference to the relationship between the action-types they contain and the achievement of some end, we might assume that they are verified by reference to special rules for the sort of project at hand. Squinting at the project- relevant rules would be the effective analogue of intending to indicate the end of the project. The supposition that there are such rules seems to me some- what more artificial, however, than the supposition that each technical 'ought' indicates an end. Owing to the complexity and particularity of a project like building a particular house, it is doubtful that any rules could be stated beforehand that would give us all the technical 'ought'-sentences that would become true in the course of the building, even though there is a fairly definite set of ends (or a single complex end) that will make them true. A set of rules could of course be constructed to accommodate these technical 'oughts', but then we would have an account of how these sentences could work rather than one of how they do work. But whether Castafieda's and Hintikka's prima facie 'oughts' are really technical 'oughts', they are different from Ross's prima facie duties. For if we think of 'prima facie ought' as designating a property, it is a property (roughly) of pairs of an agent and a kind of action. The reason for examining the way inheritance works in each man's writing was to show that an 'ought' is in- herited by a kind of action in cases where. it can be shown that a prospective action will be of that kind and that the action is already known to be of a kind such that an action of the latter kind ought to be done by the agent. An examination of Ross will show that 'is a prima facie duty' designates a property of something like particular actions-in-prospect. In The Right and the Good, Ross sometimes characterizes prima facie duties as "things that tend to be our duty" (18, note, and 28), but his fullest characterization occurs in this passage: I suggest 'prima facie duty' or 'conditional duty' as a brief way of referring to the char- acteristic (quite distinct from that of being a duty proper) which an act has, in virtue of being of a certain kind (e.g. the keeping of a promise), of being an act which would be a duty proper if it were not at the same time of another kind which is morally significant. Whether an act is a duty proper or actual duty depends on all the morally significant</page><page sequence="50">50 BRUCE VERMAZEN kinds it is an instance of. The phrase 'prima facie duty' must be apologized for, since (1) it suggests that what we are speaking of is a certain kind of duty, whereas it is in fact not a duty but something related in a special way to duty ... (2) 'Prima' facie suggests that one is speaking only of an appearance which a moral situation presents at first sight, and which may turn out to be illusory; whereas what I am speaking of is an objective fact involved in the nature of the situation, or more strictly in an element of its nature, though not, as duty proper does, arising from its whole nature. (19-20) The term 'act' here applies to particular actions (events that instantiate action-types, in my terminology) and to particular action-in-prospect (pros- pective events that would instantiate action-types, but which perhaps never occur). It is these acts that bear the property of being a prima facie duty. But the term is used ambiguously: it also refers to the property in virtue of which an act is a prima facie duty in the first sense. Ross proposes a list of seven primary kinds of prima facie duty, or properties such that if an action has one of them, it is a prima facie duty: the duties of promise-keeping or fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and non- maleficence. These can give rise in particular cases to other prima facie duties (second sense): when we have such an inclination [i.e. one that would lead to harming others] the primary duty not to harm others gives rise to a consequential duty to resist the inclina- tion (22); the [prima faciel duty of obeying the laws of one's country arises partly ... from the duty of gratitude for the benefits one has received from it (27). Ross does not explain how one prima facie duty (second sense) gives rise to another, but it is plausible to suppose that something like the Inheritance Principle is involved, particularly clause (v): on many, perhaps most, occa- sions, the only way to avoid harming others is to resist the inclination to harm them; in many cases, the only way to avoid showing ingratitude to one's country is to obey its laws; so if, on such occasions, the properties of being the doing of harm and being an act of gratefulness are morally relevant, so are the properties of being a resisting of maleficent inclination and being a lawful act. Of course, Ross must think the latter properties are always morally rele- vant if he wants to call them prima facie duties (second sense). If a version of the IP really explains his claim, it must be that he assumes one must always resist the inclination to harm in order to avoid doing harm, and must always obey the laws in order to show gratitude (depending on what exactly is con- cealed in the adverb 'partly'). But, though the assumptions are doubtful, I think he is making them. Later, after he has silently begun to refer to the property of being a prima facie duty as "prima facie rightness", he says that we come to apprehend "the</page><page sequence="51">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 51 self-evident general principle of prima facie duty" pertaining to promise- keeping by first seeing "the prima facie rightness of an act which would be the fulfillment of a particular promise", and of another and another, and then generalizing (33). Here it seems that he means to allow that an act is prima facie right or dutiful no matter how it is described; and that is an endorse- ment of an analogue of the IP for prima facie dutifulness. If an act is a prima facie duty when described as the keeping of a promise, and if the act is also describable as the waiting for Pinkerton's return, then it is still a prima facie duty described merely as the waiting for Pinkerton's return. Some awkwardness is created, however, by plugging this into Ross's briefer characterization of a prima facie duty as something that tends to be one's duty: this may fit promise-keeping, but not, I think, waiting for Pinkerton's return, which is only a prima facie duty because of the terms of Butterfly's promise. The awkwardness increases if we look at a situation in which both some act and a refraining from that act are prima facie duties, e.g. in which I have promised to 0, but /ing would be maleficent. Here we seem forced to say that I have a prima facie duty to be maleficent, whereas it is being non-maleficent, not being maleficent, that tends to be my duty. When Ross describes situations such as this one, he is extremely circumspect: Where a possible act is seen to have two characteristics in virtue of one of which it is prima facie right, and in virtue of the other prima facie wrong, we are (I think) well aware that we are not certain whether we ought or ought not to do it. (30) Again, our judgments about our particular duties are not logical conclusions from self-evident premises. The only possible premises would be the general principles stating their prima facie rightness or wrongness qua having the different characteristics they do have. (31) Every act therefore, viewed in some aspects, will be prima facie right, and viewed in others, prima facie wrong, and right acts can be distinguished from wrong acts only as being those which, of all those possible for the agent in the circumstances, have the greatest balance of prima facie rightness, in those respects in which they are prima facie right, over their prima facie wrongness, in those respects in which they are prima facie wrong. (41) I presume that his evident concern to qualify these predications with 'in virtue of', 'qua', 'viewed in some aspects', 'in those respects', and so on results from the awkwardness of saying that a single act can be both prima facie right and prima facie wrong, i.e. both a prima facie duty and something refraining from which would be a prima facie duty. Still, inheritance is allowed: an act is a prima facie duty under any descrip- tion as long as there is at least one description under which it is a prima facie duty. The question at issue is whether this inheritance is a mirror of the kind</page><page sequence="52">52 BRUCE VERMAZEN of inheritance desired by Castafieda and Hintikka. I think it is not. For Castanieda's case, the reason is this: we might accept as true that for all actions and actions-in-prospect x, x is a prima facie duty if and only if a pres- cription to do x is endorsed in some context (in Castafieda's sense of 'en- dorsed'). But here we have serious reference to actions, or acts, not to kinds of action. A prescription to do a particular act x would have to be very detailed: it would have to include at least enough predicates true of x to distinguish it from all other actions. If we think of this prescription as a long conjunction of prescriptions, each of which employs just one predicate true of x, it is tempting to think that each of the conjuncts is also a prescription to do x, and that therefore each endorsement of one of them makes true a prima facie 'ought'-sentence which corresponds to a statement that x, described in terms of the predicate in that conjunct, is a prima facie duty. For instance, we might start with the equivalence 'A is a prima facie duty, if and only if the prescription 'John, F and John, G and John, H...' is endorsed in context 1', where the prescription fully describes A; we might then go by Castanieda's rules from the righthand side of the equivalence to the statement 'The pres- cription 'John, F' is endorsed in context 1', and hence to 'John ought prima facie (as regards context 1) to F'; finally, we might suppose that this is equivalent to 'A, which is an Fing, is a prima facie duty'. But the last step is a mistake: 'John ought prima facie to F' does not report the endorsement of a prescription to do A, but only to do something of a kind of which A also happens to be an exemplar. Castanieda has no mechanism for reference to particular actions; Ross does. In Ross's writing, particular actions inherit the property of being a prima facie duty; in Castafieda's system, prescriptions, with a degree of non-specificity built in, inherit the property of being endorsed in a certain context. So Castafieda's prima facie 'oughts' can't be an adequate reflection or reconstruction of Ross' prima facie duties. The same sort of objection can be made to Hintikka. Suppose that 'A is a prima facie duty' is equivalent to "O((n &amp; p) -* q)' is valid' where 'q' is a conjunction exhaustively describing A, and that there is some conjunct 'r' in 'q' such that "O((n &amp; p) -+ r)' is also valid and that 'r' asserts the agent of A Fs; no validity claim of that sort will be equivalent to 'A, which is an Fing, is a prima facie duty'. It could at best be 'There is some action of the agent of A Fing which prima facie ought to be done'. The kind of inheritance involved in Hintikka's scheme differs radically from the kind involved in Ross's.3 I recommend, therefore, that we drop the expression 'a ought prima facie</page><page sequence="53">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 53 to O' in favor of expressions like 'Insofar as , a ought to O', or, most explicitly, 'If were the only feature of the situation relevant to a's accomplishing a's ends, it would be the case that a ought to O'. The 'ought' in such a schema is just the practical 'ought'. The work done in Searle, Frankena et al. by prima facie is done by the supposition and the subjunctive mood, which of course I have not offered an account of. The notion of prima facie duty, on the other hand, seems to me a useful one. I could accommodate Ross's prima facie duties in my account, and in a way I have already accommodated the seven primary prima facie duties: they are just candidates for aspects of a complex end that Ross thinks is implicit in the developed moral consciousness. The rest of the picture of the end would be filled out by a list of the rules that determine when one act is more of a prima facie duty than another. Ross makes a few suggestions for these rules, but they are far from complete, and at some points he suggests that perhaps there are no such rules: even if we could (as we cannot) apprehend the extent to which an act will tend on the one hand, for example, to bring about advantages for our benefactors, and on the other hand to bring about disadvantages for fellow men who are not our benefactors, there is no principle by which we can draw the conclusion that it is on the whole right or on the whole wrong ... [Wie have more or less probable opinions which are not logically justified conclusions from the general principles that one recognizes as self-evident [i.e. the principles embodying the seven primary prima facie duties] (31). Since he seems to think that one can get a moral decision right, and thus can do what one ought (absolutely) to do, there must be such rules, even if they are not self-evident and even if they are forever unknowable. Of course, a conception of the ends of and constraints on action isn't satisfactorily validated by an investigation of the developed moral consciousness of one's own time and place, even supposing there to be such a thing. But acting ac- cording to the list of primary prima facie duties properly weighted is one can- didate for such a conception. To get a full reconstruction of Ross's notion, however, I need to go farther, but not much farther. Since I have already adopted Davidson's analysis of sentences about actions, I have some individuals - the values of the event- variables - that can be the bearers of the property of being a prima facie duty. At first glance, one might think that I still haven't provided enough individuals, since for Ross acts can forever fail to be done and yet still be prima facie duties, whereas the values of my event-variables (in action-sen-</page><page sequence="54">54 BRUCE VERMAZEN tences) are only actions that get done. I could close this gap in either of two ways, depending on the direction taken by the rest of a full treatment of the truth-conditions of English sentences. If the domain of interpretation for the formal counterpart of English included possible individuals (as in Nino Cocchiarella's semantic treatment of modal logic) then being a prima facie duty would be a property of actual and possible individuals. 'Beneficence is a prinm facie duty' would have as its formal representation '(x, e)(Does good (x, e) -* Is a prima facie duty (e))', where the quantifiers are understood to range over all individuals, actual and possible. The other alternative is to find some account of subjunctive conditionals (perhaps in terms of possible individuals, perhaps not) and treating 'A is a prima facie duty' as equivalent to 'If (3x)(x = A), then Is a prima facie duty (A)', with the 'If ... then ...' connective understood subjunctively. 'Beneficence is a prima facie duty' would be represented by '(x, e)(if (Does good (x, e)) then (Is a prima facie duty (e)))'. Neither alternative is more than the barest sketch, but the question of how to talk about undone actions opens a controversy I want to excuse myself from. In either case, the list of primary prima facie duties can be regarded as a definition of the predicate 'Is a prima facie duty', and the unstated weight- ing principles can be regarded as a theory about the relationship between the conditions of truth for sentences attributing prima facie dutihood and those for sentences containing the practical 'ought' indexed for the ends of and constraints on action. No provision needs to be made, then, for a special 'prima facie ought'. Insofar as it is just the technical 'ought', it has been provided for. To the extent that it differs from the technical 'ought', it is a misleading term of art with no simple counterpart in pre-1930 English and is best abandoned. NOTES TO CHAPTER VI 1 I conclude this from his rule DR1 (689): IfFi A -B, then e iOiA -OiB'. Subscripted ci 'ci' isn't explained in his article, but it seems to mean 'is a theorem of the propositional calculus with deontic operators subscripted 'i". 2 A similar point can be made about Hintikka's system, since the validity of 'O((n &amp; p) (q Vr))' follows from the validity of 'O((n &amp; p) - q)'. I can find only one occurrence of a phrase like 'prima facie ought' in Ross's extensive discussion of prima facie duties in Ch. II of The Right and the Good: "It is ... clear ... that if there are things that are bad in themselves we ought, prima facie, not to bring them on others; and on this fact rests the duty of non-maleficence" (26). In this sentence we need not even construe him as asserting (what he asserts elsewhere) that every act of</page><page sequence="55">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 55 non-maleficence is a prima facie duty, but only as directing our attention (somewhat in the style of Castafieda and Hintikka) to one aspect of the case, viz., the one mentioned in the if-clause, and saying that if that were all there were to the case, we ought not, etc. However we construe that sentence, Ross certainly appears to be avoiding 'prima facie ought' almost completely. VII. MORAL MILEAGE Moral philosophy seems to spring from the attempt to answer the question 'What should a person do?' or to give reasons why it can't be answered. Let me call this the root question. Especially since Principia Ethica, the Anglo- American strain of moral philosophy has very often approached its task by examining the meanings of terms that seem central to discourse about what one ought to do: 'ought', 'right', 'good', 'morality', 'virtue'. The rela- tionship between the root question and an account of the meaning of these varies from writer to writer. Moore, we remember, held that 'this question, how 'good' is to be defined, is the most fundamental question in all Ethics', largely because 'the main object of Ethics, as a systematic science, is to give correct reasons for thinking that this or that is good; and, unless this question be answered, such reasons cannot be given' (Principia Ethica (Cambridge, 1903), 5-6). The root question is then answered by an attempt to show that there is a special relationship between what one ought to do and the com- parative goodness of the situation that would result from doing it. Unless we determine what 'good' means, we are likely to make mistakes in assessing the goodness of situations, e.g. by accepting a naturalistic criterion for goodness as a result of accepting a naturalistic account of the meaning of 'good'. Thus an account of the meaning of 'good' is a necessary condition of approaching the root question correctly. The bare knowledge of the term's meaning, however, won't give the inquirer any answers. To know that 'good' names a simple, intuitible property of states of affairs (to use one of Moore's positions) is to know to some extent what to look for in answering the question, but it doesn't help you figure out what alternatives are open to you, or what their results will be, or whether to trust your possibly defective intuitive capacity. 'Ought' has always been a sort of stepchild in the approach to ethics through language, probably because it is a modal auxiliary rather than a more manageable verb, noun, or adjective. It seems easier and more natural to talk about the properties named by or corresponding to 'right' and 'good' or the ideal structure called 'morality' (as in, e.g., Philippa Foot, 'Moral Arguments', Mind 67 (1958), 502-513) than to try to figure out what 'ought' is doing in</page><page sequence="56">56 BRUCE VERMAZEN the sentences where it occurs. Attempts to deal with 'ought' often consist in first connecting its occurrences with occurrences of words less gram- matically intractable and then dealing directly with the latter. Ross, for example, offers a tentative transformation of 'ought'-sentences into sentences with 'right' and then discusses the property of rightness. Moore does some- thing similar in Principia Ethica, though not in Ethics. Two prominent figures in the tradition, however (H. A. Prichard and R. M. Hare), have dealt with 'ought' directly and have used their treatments as grounds for fairly substantial conclusions as to what one ought to do, with- out defining 'ought' in such a way as to entail any conclusions about what one ought to do. An examination of their main claims will allow me to clarify further my own position and to give reasons to prefer it. In the essay 'Moral Obligation',' Prichard argues that there is a complete difference in meaning between the moral and the non-moral (practical, not epistemic or ideal) 'ought', and that the sort of meaning that the moral 'ought' has dictates a method for deciding what one (morally) ought to do. Since I claim that the two sets of 'ought'-sentences he would call moral and non-moral have the same truth-conditions, and since his ambiguity claim entails that they have different truth-conditions, we are contradicting one another, even though for reasons given earlier I am not entirely happy calling my account a treatment of the meaning of 'ought'. His argument is contained in the following passage, in which he is discussing Kant's distinction, in the Grundlegung, between categorical and hypothetical imperatives: Yet plainly Kant thinks there is a difference of meaning [between the 'oughts' in the two kinds of imperative], for he goes on to speak of categorical imperatives as moral im- peratives, or imperatives of morality. And, in fact, there is a difference and indeed a total difference of meaning. This difference becomes obvious if we consider instances. Thus, to borrow from Kant an instance of a hypothetical imperative, we say to a would- be poisoner: 'You ought to give a second dose'; the thought which we wish to convey is that if he does not, his purpose, viz., the death of his would-be victim, will not be realized. Indeed, this is what we really mean by our statement. At first, no doubt, the statement, 'If you do not give a second dose, your purpose will not be realized', seems to state our reason for our assertion, 'You ought to give a second dose', rather than what we mean by it. But this cannot be so, for if it were we should in making the assertion be implying the idea that whenever a man has a certain purpose, no matter what the pur- pose be, he ought to do whatever is necessary for its realization, and no one has such an idea. Hence, to put the matter generally, whenever we use the term 'ought' thus, what we really mean by the categorical statement 'I ought to do so and so' has to be expres- sed by the hypothetical statement: 'If I do not do so and so, my purpose will not be realized.' ... On the other hand, if we say to a man 'You ought to tell the truth' and mean by it</page><page sequence="57">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 57 what Kant evidently understood it to mean in calling it a categorical imperative, we do so, as Kant saw, without any reference to some purpose we may think he has ... (90-91) If we take this passage as a claim, or as entailing a claim, about the truth-con- ditions of 'ought'-sentences, it amounts to this: the truthconditions of non- moral 'ought'-sentences require reference to some purpose of the agent's (or to something co-extensive with having such-and-such a purpose); the truth- conditions of moral 'ought'-sentences don't. So 'ought' must have at least two senses. My reply can be drawn from my remarks in Chapter V about the possible ambiguity of 'end'. I think Prichard is wrong about an agent's purposes always being a determinant of what he ought non-morally to do. Sometimes his purposes do the job, but sometimes it is done by some r6le he occupies. I have argued that the difference between moral and non-moral 'oughts' lies not in the different relation to the agent's purposes, but in the fact that the r6le of agent is universal, whereas the r6les that underlie some technical 'oughts' are less than universal. The difference in what we mean by the different kinds of 'ought' can thus be accounted for without sup- posing that the difference in meaning is 'total'. Another argument for a moral/non-moral ambiguity in 'ought' may be squeezed out of some of Prichard's remarks scattered through the same essay. He thinks that the questions 'Should or ought a man to do his duty?' and 'Should or ought a man to do what is just?' make sense, in that the answer to them is not obviously 'yes' (87-88), and he thinks that they are equivalent in meaning to each other and to the question 'Should or ought a man to do what he should or ought to do?' (87-89). If he is right in thinking both of these things, then there must be something peculiar about the last of the questions, e.g. an ambiguity in 'should' or 'ought', for on the model of an ordinary question about one term of a relation, the answer is obviously 'yes': 'Is that which bears relation 0 to a man that which bears relation 0 to him?' Some argument of this sort is probably behind his remark that In putting this question [either of the first twol it is of course implied that 'should' or 'ought' is being used in some sense other than that in which to say that I ought to do so and so is only another way of saying that I am morally bound to do so and so (88). My reply is that the third question can make sense if we suppose that the two 'oughts' or 'shoulds' have different ends as targets. The reply is not very in- teresting, insofar as it could be taken merely as a decision to say 'difference of target' where Prichard would say 'difference of sense', but taken together</page><page sequence="58">58 BRUCE VERMAZEN with my account of 'ought' it is interesting, since the difference at issue is much smaller than the difference Prichard wanted there to be. I should add that I don't accept the meaning-equivalence of the first two questions and the third. Even where the target of the 'ought' in the first two questions is the ends of and constraints on action, I think it is an open ques- tion whether they impose on a person anything appropriately called 'his duty' or whether they include or entail a requirement that one act justly (rather than, e.g. for the good of future generations). Since Prichard offers only these arguments as motivation for seeking a special meaning or separate truth-conditions for moral 'ought'-sentences, there is not much point in rehearsing at length his inquiry into what that meaning is. It consists of an analysis and rejection of the definitions of 'ought' offered by Hobbes, Paley, Hutcheson, and Joseph, and the final remark, Recognition of the failure of these supposed definitions is no proof of the unique and therefore indefinable character of the thing meant by 'our being morally bound to do some action', but it does help us to recognize its unique character by forcing us to recognize its difference from other things with which it has been confused (95). And if the claim that the moral 'ought' gets its meaning by designating a property sui generis (or an infinite array of properties, one for each kind of action) is left unsupported, so also is the accompanying epistemological claim that to find out what one morally ought to do, one need only consider the situation in full and one will see or intuit which of the possible ought-to-X properties one has in the situation. (The method is described in some detail in the essay 'Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?' in Moral Obligation, 7-8.) Thus, although the truth of my account would not refute Prichard's claims about moral epistemology, it would leave them hanging. It would also deprive him of the weapon he uses to defeat all teleological theories of obligation (e.g. those of Mill, Sidgwick, and T. H. Green), namely the observation that any theory which accounts for the truth of moral 'ought'- sentences about particular actions by showing that the action is necessary2 for the achieving of some ultimate purpose resolves the moral 'ought' into the non-moral 'ought' ... And in consequence, strictly speaking the theory is not a theory of obligation, or duty, at all, but, if anything, is a theory that what are called our obligations or duties are really something else (117). I suppose Prichard's intuitionism as an epistemological doctrine is not incompatible with my account of 'ought'-sentences. After all, normally</page><page sequence="59">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 59 sighted individuals have very reliable intuitive access to the truth of sentences of the form 'x is reflecting light of a wavelength of 700 ? 75 millimicrons', even though the truth-conditions for such sentences would probably make no use of the property 'intuited'. But there is little reason to suppose that the cases are parallel. If any method for verifying 'ought'-sentences is suggested by my account, it is this: look for the ends of human action. I will deal with this suggestion further toward the end of my discussion of Hare. For Hare, as for Prichard, an account of the meaning of 'ought'-sentences doesn't entail any conclusions about what one ought to do. Ethical theory, which determines the meanings and functions of the moral words... provides only a clarification of the conceptual framework within which moral reasoning takes place; it is therefore ... neutral as between different moral opinions. But it is highly relevant to moral reasoning because ... the framework dictates the form of the reasoning (Freedom and Reason (Oxford, 1963), 89). Much of Freedom and Reason is devoted to showing just how certain moral conclusions can be argued for, given certain inclinations and imaginative powers in the person at whom the argument is aimed. Here is another attempt to get moral mileage out of a doctrine about the meaning of 'ought' without endowing it with any obvious moral content. According to Hare, 'ought' in its moral use has two characteristics that give it its meaning: prescriptivity and universalizability. The claim that it is prescriptive is discussed in terms of 'ought'-judgments or 'ought'-sentences (in use) being prescriptive. Such judgements are held to entail prescriptions or imperatives in this way: one cannot assent to both an 'ought'-sentence and a prescription not to do the action mentioned in it directed to the agent mentioned in it. The criteria of assent to a prescription or imperative are complex: they include trying to do the action where one is the agent men- tioned and believes the action open to him, showing frustration when im- pediments arise, showing disappointment or regret if the action miscarries, giving whatever aid is thought possible to an agent not oneself, etc. Criteria of assent to an 'ought'-sentence aren't discussed, but presumably they would include assent to all the prescriptions one thought corresponded to it, plus some sort of acknowledgment of the universalizability of the judgment. That truly evaluative 'ought'-sentences are prescriptive in this sense is made true by definition in The Language of Morals, 164. But this doesn't render the claim quite vacuous, since in Freedom and Reason he says The substantive part of the prescriptivist thesis is that there are prescriptive uses of these words, and that these uses are important and central to the words' meanings (84).</page><page sequence="60">60 BRUCE VERMAZEN The defmition only attempts to embody a feature of the usage of these words that they demonstrably have. The claim that they are important and central, however, seems only to be cashed out as the claim that on a descriptivist or naturalist account of the meaning of 'ought' (and 'good' and so on), one can't see why there are problems about akrasia, about 'ought' implying 'can', and about a few other things. So in a way the claim is ad hominem unless the prescriptive/descriptive dichotomy exhausts the field of possible accounts of the meaning of 'ought'. At any rate, it is clear what the prescriptivity of 'ought' amounts to in terms of a restriction on the truth-conditions for 'ought'-sentences: a moral 'ought'- statement (i.e. 'ought'-sentence in use) of the form 'a ought to 4' is true-for-x only if x's behavior shows his commitment to a's 4ing, e.g. by trying to 4 (if x = a), showing frustration or disappointment in the appropriate circum- stances, and so on. The predicate 'true-for-x' has to be used here rather than just 'true' in that Hare thinks of 'ought' as an indexical which picks out sets of principles, and these sets vary from speaker to speaker, so that in one person's mouth 'a ought to 4' might be true and in another's false, even though they are both using the moral 'ought' at its most robust. The thesis that 'ought' is universalizable (again translated into a claim about truth-conditions) is presented as the thesis that for each true 'ought'- sentence there is a true sentence embodying a principle which, together with a statement of the circumstances, entails the 'ought'-sentence (Language of Morals, 156-157). In The Language of Morals, Hare says that moral judg- ments - that is, issuances of universalizable and prescriptive 'ought'-sentences - must be made with the principle 'in mind'. It is not always easy to elicit just what the principle is; but it always makes sense to ask what it is. The speaker cannot deny that there is any such principle (176). Further, this principle is the reason which supports the judgment. Having the principle in mind, then, doesn't entail being able to articulate it or even knowing what it is; it is just being willing to admit that there is some principle or other that fits the case. Prescriptivity and universalizability work together to provide a party to a moral dispute some leverage against his opponent. When we are trying, in a concrete case, to decide what we ought to do, what we are looking for ... is an action to which we can commit ourselves (prescriptivity) but which we are at the same time prepared to accept as exemplifying a principle of action to be prescribed for others in like circumstances (universalizability). If when we consider</page><page sequence="61">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 61 some proposed action, we find that, when universalized, it yields prescriptions which we cannot accept, we reject this action as a solution to our moral problems - if we cannot universalize the prescription, it cannot become an 'ought' (Freedom and Reason, 89-90). The application to a dispute is clear: if we want someone to change his opin- ion about what he (or anyone) ought to do, we offer him a 'universalization' of his 'ought' - a principle which would support his judgment - and show him that he would not assent to some prescription entailed by it. Of course, there is no end to the ways in which a given 'ought'-sentence can be universalized, so it is always open to the offerer of the 'ought'-judgment to reject the fulcral principle. But if he does accept it, and if his inclinations are as his opponent supposes, then he can be gotten to retract his original 'ought'- judgment on grounds having to do with the meaning of 'ought'. I can construct a sort of analogue for universalizability within my account of the truth-conditions of 'ought'-sentences, but none for prescriptivity. The set of 'ought'-sentences true with respect to a given end is generated by recur- sion on a basic sentence or set of sentences that says that one ought to ac- complish that end. The clauses by which the recursion proceeds are all plausibly subsumed under the description 'a description of the circumstances', since they only invoke information about what will cause what and what resources there are in the language for describing such events. The Harean principle that stands behind a given 'ought'-sentence can then be constructed by changing the expression referring to the agent to 'anyone' and prefixing a 'Whenever this is the case' clause detailing the circumstances that enter into the recursion leading from the ends of and constraints on human action to this agent's ending up in the situation where he ought to do whatever it is. Such a sentence is always constructible, and indeed is virtually constructed in the generation of the sentence giving the truth-conditions for the particular sentence in question. I would even agree with Hare's contention that the maker of the judgment has to have this sentence (or at least the generating process) in mind, in the very soft sense that he must admit that some such re- cursion - some derivation from some end - must be possible. So on my ac- count 'ought'-sentences are universalizable. But they are not prescriptive. Nothing in my account entails that the sin- cere utterer of 'a ought to O' cares whether a Os or not. So my account won't make Hare's style of moral argument work. Hare's most vigorous defense of prescriptivity (in Ch. 5 of Freedom and Reason) has already been alluded to: prescriptive uses of 'ought' (and the</page><page sequence="62">62 BRUCE VERMAZEN other so-called moral words) create at least three major problems: "the im- possibility of defining moral words naturalistically ..."; the problems raised by "ought' implies 'can"; and the problem of akrasia. In order to defend my position, I need to say something about these poblems. Chapter 4 of Freedom and Reason defends the claim that when I judge that a ought to 0, using the 'full force' of 'ought', I must also judge that a can 0. There are apparent exceptions to this, e.g. where 'a ought to O' really means 'There is a set of standards (to which I don't subscribe) according to which a is to O' and where one is making an exception of oneself while sub- scribing to the general principle on behalf of everyone else. Hare says that in the former case one is using 'ought' in inverted commas, and that in the latter one is "lifting a corner of the net". But these are only apparent exceptions, for in them 'ought' is not used with its 'full force'; in particular, it is not used in such a way that it involves assenting to the imperative 'Let me 0 in a's circumstances'. When it is used in that way (i.e. prescriptively), it does imply 'can', and indeed the prescriptivity explains why it implies 'can': assenting to the prescription involves trying to 0, and that in tum involves thinking one can 0. So if one judges one can't 4, it follows that one can't assent to the prescription, hence can't say wholeheartedly 'I ought to O' or anything that implies 'I ought to O' or 'Let me O'. I have already denied that 'ought' implies 'can', except in the special case of non-co-instantiable action-types. My intuitions about particular cases are that one often thinks one ought to do something that one can't do, but these cases seem also to involve a failure to assent to the corresponding imperative (in Hare's sense). That is, the person can think he ought to 0, think he can't 0, and yet not try to 0. Whether such cases involve putting 'ought' in inverted commas or lifting a corner of the net could be argued. But there is another sort of case which Hare discusses and which seems to meet his criteria for as- sent to an imperative without also involving 'ought' implying 'can': a man thinks he ought to obey God's commands, and thinks also that God has com- manded him to kill his first-born. He sincerely believes he can't do it; he has held the axe above the crib and been unable to bring his arms down. Yet he continues to want to; he feels remorse and disappointment at his inability; he even prays to God for the strength to obey His command. We have some- thing enough like what Hare calls assent to an imperative to say that here 'ought' does entail the corresponding imperative. And yet it doesn't entail the corresponding 'can', since there is nothing incoherent in describing the</page><page sequence="63">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 63 man's state of mind as thinking that he ought to kill the child, and thinking also that he can't. So, far from explaining why 'ought' implies 'can', pre- scriptivity is compatible with 'ought but cannot'. Hare here resorts to the claim that moral language is flexible: the 'ought' in a case of 'backsliding' is being used in a way in an attenuated sense, without in another way departing from the meaning of the word as we were using it all along (Freedom and Reason, 76). In such a case we "restore the appearance of prescriptive universality" by substituting for genuine prescriptiveness, a mere feeling, varying in strength, that we are not playing our part in the scheme which we claim to be accepting (op. cit., 76). But of course if 'ought' is flexible in this way, then it isn't prescriptive in his sense (the position he seems to take here) and it doesn't really imply 'can', though perhaps it still suggests 'can'. The fact that my account doesn't ac- commodate the doctrine that 'ought' implies 'can' is thus not a weakness relative to Hare's account. There is nothing incoherent in supposing that the end of human action is unrealizable and that therefore many true 'ought'- sentences with that target will have corresponding true 'cannot'-sentences. (In such a state of affairs, of course, not every 'ought'-sentence will be mat- ched by a 'cannot'-sentence, for there could be pairs of 'ought'-and 'can'- sentences that were both true, but where instantiating the action-type com- mon to them would do nothing toward realizing the end; I ought to use an Allen wrench when I am adjusting the dial on the stove, but if I use it to pick my teeth, I haven't done what I ought to.) It is clear from what I have already said that Hare treats the problem of akrasia as a case of 'ought but can't'. I hope it is also clear that his treatment of the problem consists in a partial abandonment of his claims about the prescriptivity of 'ought', so that it is hard to credit his claim that one can only understand why there is a problem about akrasia if one accepts the pres- criptivity of 'ought'. Classical formulations of the problem seem always to deal with the possibility of thinking something good, or thinking one thing .better than another, and yet not doing or choosing or seeking that thing. If it is a problem about words at all, it is a problem about 'good' or 'better', not 'ought'. Indeed, Hare's examples (Medea and St. Paul) contain problems about what these people thought good or right but couldn't steel themselves to do, rather than about what they thought they ought to do. Perhaps there is</page><page sequence="64">64 BRUCE VERMAZEN a usual connection between what one thinks good in the way of action or the results of action and what one thinks one ought to do, but it isn't clearly a tight enough connection for one to argue from the fact that there is a problem about akrasia regarding the good to the claim that there is a corre- sponding one about akrasia regarding doing what one ought. The standard example for raising doubt about the tightness of the connection is one where one has a choice between a just action and an unjust one, but where the unjust one would lead to a better situation in the long run. The contention is that it is at least conceivable that the just action is the one one ought to do. Of course, the power of the example to convince would come, if at all, from a laying out of the details. But its currency shows that it is not obvious that a problem about thinking something good will also arise for thinking something what one ought to do. Since Hare gives no independent support for the existence of the latter problem, there is no present reason to suppose that there is such a problem. At least many of the cases in which people seem to think that they ought to do things and yet don't do them, despite their ability to do them, are just as they seem to be. The remaining major problem whose existence is supposed to provide evidence for the prescriptivity of the moral 'ought' is the impossibility of defining moral terms naturalistically. Since a naturalistic definiens for 'ought' requires that all the terms in it not be prescriptive, the defmiens would always lack the prescriptive force of the definiendum. The point I would make regarding my account is that while it is not prescriptive, it is also not natural- istic. All the terms in it are descriptive by Hare's standards. Neither a charac- terization of the end nor even the expression 'the end' occurs in the statement of truth-conditions, so insofar as the statement can serve as a definition, it is a non-prescriptivist definition. Even if this is seen as a quibble about how much of my account should be called a definition, it is an open question whether a characterization of the end of human action, the target of the moral 'ought', would be prescriptive in Hare's sense or not, even though it is an ideal for human intentions. One could perhaps take a position like Hare's on 'thinking something good' or 'thinking that one ought' and say that a thinks E is the end of human action only if a seeks to accomplish E in all he does. But while such a single-minded pursuit would be good evidence that a so regarded E, I want also to allow for the case where a person thought that E was the end, but where also he thought E unrealizable by himself or anyone. There is room in</page><page sequence="65">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 65 such a case for a measure of Harean prescriptivity, in that the person could feel deep regret at E's unrealizability, pray God to make him (or humanity) more perfect, pursue ends that somehow approximate to the end, etc. There will also be cases in which the agent thinks that the end is realizable, and where he would attempt to realize it except for adverse circumstances. He might be discouraged owing to earlier failed attempts to realize it. He might think that the realization of the ideal depended on some sort of cooperative effort the chances for which were very slim, so that this may be a time at which to pay more attention to his private interests, which may not be served at all by lone adherence to the ideal. He might feel that though E is an ideal for human intentions, there are more important concerns for him than being human. Perhaps there is prescriptivity in even these cases, since they have in common the claim that the agent would attempt to realize E if conditions were different, and since that claim is part of the basis for the further claim that E is regarded by the agent as the end. It could be regarded as the whole basis for the claim, I think, only if the agent's desire to pursue E given changed conditions were stronger than all his other desires. For there are many things one might do were conditions dif- ferent that one wouldn't be said to regard as ideals. But I want to suggest that there are grounds for saying someone regards E as an ideal for human inten- tion even where the agent's desire to conform his intentions to E is weaker than some other desire. These grounds are provided by buttressing the evidence of desire with arguments by analogy to cases where one concludes that something or other has an end. For instance, you can argue that a part of an apparent system has an end or is for something by showing that the system as a whole is doing something or other and that the part contributes in some way toward the system's action. This is the style of argument one uses to establish that the liver's end is the purification of the blood. A dif- ferent argument is used to establish that instruments like knives or technicians like carpenters have ends. It consists roughly in showing that to classify something as a knife or a carperter involves deciding that it is for cutting or carpentry, and is a sort of conceptual inquiry. There are also ad hoc assign- ments of ends, as when a flatiron is used as a doorstop; this particular flatiron's end is being a doorstop just because its owner treats it as one. Finally, it is possible to argue as in my first two cases that a person has a particular end on the grounds that he is manifestly pursuing that end. Arguing by analogy with the last two sorts of cases is not a very promising</page><page sequence="66">66 BRUCE VERMAZEN approach, but it could be done. The difficulty with the last style of argument is that it is implausible to claim that all people in fact are pursuing a single end or set of ends. Perhaps some sort of theory about deep and universal drives would provide the groundwork for such a claim. To argue by analogy with a case where an end was assigned ad hoc would necessitate finding a being with the requisite authority over humans generally, a commander-in- chief of the universe. Aristotle's argument that the '7pyov or function of man is a certain kind of activity of the soul (in Eth. Nic. Bk. I, Ch. 7) is an example of the argument by analogy with the ends technicians have qua technicians, although his ideal is not one for intentions. The main problem with this sort of argument is that anyone who argued that it was a necessary condition for being human that one have intentions of the sort involved in traditional moral ideals would have to deny human status to a large portion of our biological species. The first style of argument is the easiest and most persuasive, I think, but it is easily trivialized. Looked at in retrospect, any agglomeration of events can be seen as the working of a system, viz., the system that does just what was in that agglomeration. So any participant in the events can be seen as a part of the system, and his end can be held to be just whatever intentions he seems to have realized. Another variety of this general style of argument at- tempts to show that the agent is part of a system which would operate in a certain way but for certain flaws in the cosmos, and that his end is to do what he would do were these flaws mended. The working of the unrealized system here is argued for in a way parallel to an argument that a certain defective or degenerate system would work in a certain way in an undamaged state: an anatomical researcher would use such an argument to account for the struc- ture of the non-functioning hypothalamus he has just sliced up. One might argue in this way to the conclusion that the intention to act morally or be a moral person (according to some ideal moral code) was the end, since humanity allegedly has the potential of abiding by a common set of prin- ciples to promote individual welfare, secure a just distribution of goods, and so forth. Fleshing out the account of what it is to act morally is of course difficult; even more difficult would be showing that this potential system of intentions, of all those devisable, deserved to be called the end. One doesn't have this sort of problem with a dissected organ. It is difficult to distinguish a case in which the intention to act according to some moral code is held to be the end from one in which it is just one end</page><page sequence="67">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 67 among others, but where it is obvious to the utterer of a morality-targeted 'ought'-sentence and to his audience that that is the end in question. Harder yet if part of the end is to achieve this one - moral action - at the expense of all others. And this could be the case even if morality was not thought to be an end that was ultimate in any way other than being ultimate by consen- sus for settling questions about what ends are to be pursued. Given such a speaker and such an audience, it will not be necessary to qualify the 'ought'-sen- tence with 'If we are to act morally'. Perhaps this lack of necessity is what would lead a person in a society where basic moral disagreement was rare to identify the universal or categorical 'ought' (which I have been loosely calling 'the moral 'ought' ') with the 'ought' that serves to detail the requirements of a life lived according to the moral code of that society. I have presented these four styles of argument as ways of buttressing the claim that E is an ideal for a when we already are satisfied that a would, under certain circumstances, strive to realize E, or that a would strive to realize E if he didn't think it impossible. I think further that these arguments can also stand alone as arguments that E is an ideal for human intention, that is, that it is grounds for the claim that something is an ideal that one can construct such an argument conceming it, even if the ideal is not attractive to the constructor, although special circumstances need to be brought in to make the claim intelligible. A person with strong anthropomorphic religious beliefs, for instance, might think that God wishes us all to have certain inten- tions and has the authority to enforce this wish. Even though this person did not find the intentions in question wholly attractive, we could say that he regarded them as an ideal or as the way human intentions are supposed to go. An adherent of Rousseau might, on psychological grounds, conclude that if it were not for the appurtenances of civilization, all humans would have certain intentions, and that therefore those are the intentions humans are supposed to have; he need not find them attractive, though perhaps he thinks he would find them attractive if he, too, had not been corrupted. At any rate, the special circumstances that need to be brought in do not make the claim that something is an ideal prescriptive. The propounder of the ideal can plausibly regard it even with some distaste. If that claim is accepted, then, my account of 'ought' is not prescriptive even if the ideality of the end is included in the account. I have also preserved in my account a final difficulty that Hare thinks favors his account, viz., that a naturalistic definition of (or in my case, a naturalistic set of truth-</page><page sequence="68">68 BRUCE VERMAZEN conditions for) 'ought' in its moral use is impossible. For there is no reduc- tion to 'naturalistic' concepts of the notion of the end: it is an ideal. This does not entail that a person with very definite naturalistic opinions about the end (e.g. that it is the intention to mind one's own business or to serve the state) is using 'ought' in an exceptionable way: for his argument that this is the end must go beyond consideration of what natural characteristics such intentions have. This perhaps puts me in the position with respect to the end of action that the intuitionists were in with respect to goodness or oughting to k: I must reconcile myself to the claim that it is sui generis and that there are no con- clusive arguments to the conclusion that something is it. But I am worse off than the intuitionists in that I see no reason to claim that people have in- tuitive access to what it is. I would only claim that anyone who uses 'ought' in the way Kant called categorical must believe that there is such an end, even if he is unsure what it is. My purpose has been to defend my account of 'ought' against the charge that its lack of prescriptivity is a fault. If I have been successful, it follows that the logical properties of 'ought' don't allow one to gain the sort of leverage in a moral dispute that Hare claims for it. My account could be seen as advising parties to a moral dispute to direct their attention toward their possible difference of opinion as to the end. All the other matters which bear on the truth of an 'ought'-sentence are in principle intersubjectively settleable, but the considerations bearing on identifying the end are inconclusive, and a disagreement at that point may foreclose any possibility of agreement else- where. Aside from suggesting this rather weak advice, however, I think my account of the truth-conditions of 'ought'-sentences is morally barren. All the issues purportedly settled by earlier accounts are left open: naturalism versus intuitionism, descriptivism versus prescriptivism, teleological versus deontological theories, and so on. In a way, this barrenness is a result of a decision to be conservative in my account of 'ought', to aim at a theory less substantive than those of the past. But that decision was motivated by a desire to give only as much substance to 'ought' as the vast majority of English speakers could agree on: to minimize the set of truths analytic by my lights and false by others'.4</page><page sequence="69">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 69 NOTES TO CHAPTER VII 1 In Moral Obligation (Oxford, 1949), 87-163. 2 Sometimes he characterizes these theories in this non-equivalent way: "the task of discovering what we ought to do consists in ascertaining first what that purpose or end of ours is and then what the acts are on various occasions which would do most to effect its realization, the character required for an act to be what we ought to do being that of contributing most to its realization" (115). An act could of course do more than other acts toward realizing a purpose and yet not be necessary to its realization. 3 This at least seems to be his position in most of The Language of Morals. Perhaps he takes a different position in Freedom and Reason, 72, where he says "... in making up my mind what I ought to do ... I have to ask myself 'What maxim (to use Kant's term) can I accept as of universal application in cases like this, whether or not I play the part in the situation which I am playing now?' " Assuming that the question must be an- swered, we seem to have here a rather strong requirement as to how explicitly in mind one's principles have to be when one uses 'ought', or at least 'I ought'.

APPENDIX The proposal in Chapter I would result in formalizing the inference thus: (3x)((x = b) &amp; OD(x)) &amp; (3x)((x = b) &amp; OS(x)) (3 x)((x = b) &amp; O(D(x) &amp; S(x))) As Hintikka treats such questions, to ask whether this is valid is to ask whether its negation is satisfiable, i.e. whether for its negation one can con- struct a set of maximal consistent sets of sentences each of which would partially describe one of the array of worlds necessary for the truth of the negation. The original formula is valid only if its negation is not satisfiable. The following construction shows that the negation (N) of the formula now in question is satisfiable. The column headed ',u' includes the sentences that would have to be true of the real world if N were true. (= (1) (3x)((x = b) &amp; OD(x)) (2) (3x)((x = b) &amp; OS(x))</page><page sequence="70">70 BRUCE VERMAZEN (3) (x)((x # b) V P(-D(x) V -S(x))) (This is the negation of the consequent of the inference.) (4) (a=b)&amp;OD(a) (5) (c = b) &amp; OS(c) ('a' and 'c' here are arbitrarily chosen proper names used to generate instances of (1) and (2)) (6) a = b (7) OD(a) (8) c = b (9) OS(c) (10) a = c (from (6) and (8)) (I1l) (3x)(x = b) (12) (3x)OD(x) (13) (3x)OS(x) (It would be idle to add in- stances of (12) and (13) (14) (3x)(x =a) (from (6) and (11)) (15) (3x)(x = c) (from (8) and (11)) (16) a + b V P(~-D(a) V -S(a)) (17) c #b V P(-D(c) V -S(c)) ((16) and (17) are instances of (3)) (18) P(QD(a) V -S(a)) (from (6) and (16)) (19) P(-D(c) V -S(c)) (from (8) and (17)) Someone might balk at lines (1 1) and (12), since the constants used to generate them are not represented by existence statements such as 'O( 3x)(x = a)', but because of the intended interpretation of lines (7) and (9), we can conclude that 'a' and 'c' denote in every deontic alternative and so are available to generate (16) and (17). To continue: formula (18) requires that there be some deontic alternative (,a) containing the following sentences: (20) ~-D(a) V -S(a) (21) D(a) (from (7)) (22) -S(a) (from (20) and (21)) (23) S(c) (from (9))</page><page sequence="71">THE LOGIC OF PRACTICAL 'OUGHT'-SENTENCES 71 Formula (19) requires that there be another deontic alternative (11b) con- taining the following sentences: (24) -D(c) V -S(c) (25) S(c) (from (9)) (26) -D(c) (from (24) and (25)) (27) D(a) (from (7)) No other sentences are required. In particular, sentence (10) is not strong enough to generate a contradiction in either ga or ,b; to do that, it would have to be replaced by 'O(a = c)' or 'O(a = c)', which gets us roughly back to where we started. However, as I suggested earlier, if one adopts Kripke's views on names as rigid designators, the stronger premises will be available. At any rate, the model system {, a, ,b} shows that the proposed for- malization of the problematic inference is not valid. The validity of the formula in Chapter VI is shown by the failure of any attempt to construct a model set of satisfy its negation, 'P(O(-p V q) &amp; p &amp; r &amp; (-r V ((-q V s) &amp; (-s V q))) &amp; -s)'.The first conjunct in the scope of 'P' entails that the model set contain '-p V q' (by Hintikka's rule (C.O*)), so the second one entails that it contain 'q'. The third and fourth together entail that it contain '-q V s', so it must also contain 's'. But by the last con- junct it contains '-s' and so is not consistent, hence not a model set.
