Furthermore, the notes of Skeat and the recent study of Robertson and Hupp? have clearly shown that the Biblical text reached Langland not directly, but surrounded by an accretion of commentary. Yet in relatively few cases is our knowledge sufficiently de tailed to permit us to know with any degree of certainty the form or forms in which a given text reached Langland and the artistic purposes he made it serve. The present essay seeks to study in detail two Biblical texts ? to show the evo lution of the bodies of commentary with which Langland came into contact, and to examine the ways in which he adapted commentary, and on occasion even text, to fulfill his artistic intention. I. Pes Superbiae In Passus II 108-111 of the G-text, Holy Church says of Lucifer: He was an archangel of heuene . on of godes kny3tes; He and other with hym . that hulde nou3t with treuthe, Lopen out in lothliche forme . for hus false wille; He hadde lust to be lyke . hus lord god almyghty. Ponam pedem meum in aquilone, et ero similis altissimo.1 The Latin quotation with which the above passage ends, although occasionally attributed to Origen, is manifestly indebted to St. Augustine's compression of parts of two verses of the Old Latin Isaiah 14.13-14: 'Ponam sedem meam ad aquilonem, et ero similis altissimo. '2 However, what is not equally clear is why 1 All references to Piers Plowman in the present article are to the edition of W. W. Skeat (Oxford 1886). * See A. L. Kellogg, 'Satan, Langland, and the North,' Speculum 24 (1949) 413-414; D. W. Robertson and B. F. Hupp?, Piers Plowman and the Scriptural Tradition (Princeton 1951) 44 n. 52. The attribution to Origen is to be found in two Oxford manuscripts, the Septuplum (MS Oxford, Univ. Coll. 71, fol. 29r) and a Tractatus de septem viciis principalibus (MS Oxford, Bodl. Laud Misc. 549, fol. 9r). The former reads: 'Or?genes enim ait quoniam omnis elatus filius elati qui dixit "Ponam sedemmeam ad aquilonem, et ero similis altissimo. " ' If this attribution were accepted, the ultimate source would obviously be Origen, for the unknown writer on whom the two manuscripts depend seems to state quite clearly that it was Origen (i.e., his Latin translator, Rufinus) who put the words 'Ponam... altissimo' the mouth of the ' elatus, ' Satan. However, the attribution seems to be without foundation. The passage in Origen alluded to actually reads (in the Latin of Rufinus): ' Et iterum dicit elatus hic et superbus: "Ascendam in coelum, supra sidera coeli ponam thronum meum, sedebo in monte excelso supra montes altos, qui sunt ad aquilonem, adscendam supra nubes, et ero similis altissimo"... Omnis ergo, qui elatus est et superbus, vel filius est elati huius vel discipulus et imitator' (In Numeros homil?a XII [Origines Werke, ed. W. A. Baehrens, VII (Leipzig 1921) 105]). From the above, it is apparent that Origen has quoted the two verses of Is. 14.13-14 nearly entire, while the text in question merges one part of each into a single whole; moreover, in verse 13 Origen reads 'ponam thronum meum' instead of 'ponam sedem meam.' In the Vetus Italica, ed. Pierre Sabatier (Rheims 1743, Paris 1751) II 543, one may find listed numerous early readings of Is. 14.13-14, several of them showing a tendency to compress the two verses. It appears, however, that the earliest occurrence</page><page sequence="3">LANGLAND AND TWO SCRIPTURAL TEXTS 387 Langland chose to alter ' sedem' to ' pedem. '3 Although this is surely a diminutive, not to say microscopic, problem, its limitations are not without advantage. It is here possible, I think, to see more or less exactly what Langland's sources were, and how he shaped them to his own purposes. In his Enarrationes in Psalmos, St. Augustine interprets the word 'pes' as a figure of love, of the movement of the soul towards its desired object. Hence one finds expressed, in terms of this image, the central Augustinian doctrine of the two loves: charity, which moves upward toward God, and cupidity, which falls away from God toward the created: The foot of the soul is rightly understood to be love. When depraved, this love is called cupidity or lust; when righteous, right love or charity... Charity moves toward walking, and perfecting, and ascending ; pride moves toward a fall.4 Since Satan was the first to fall from pride, it is not surprising to find him singled out as a particularly dark example of wrongly directed love. In com menting on the text, 'They shall be made drunk by the plenty of thy house/ (Ps. 35.9), St. Augustine points out the perilous position of the creature especially favored by God. When such a one has received abundantly of the gifts of God, he is in danger of regarding them as his own private property, and hence as fit subjects for self-congratulation. Pride ? or in pedal imagery the foot of pride ? is then most to be feared. Non venial mihi pes superbiae [Ps. 35.12]... 'Beneath the shelter of thy wings the sons of men shall find their hope, and they shall be made drunk by the plenty of thy house. ' When anyone shall have begun to drink in exceeding plenty from that fountain, let him take care lest he become proud... Why did the Psalmist call that [self-regarding love] 'foot'? Because by becoming proud it deserted God and went from Him. The Psalmist declared that one's foot was one's love. Let not the foot of pride come unto me.6 Satan, foremost among the angels and the most richly endowed of God's of the form 'Ponam sedem meam ad aquilonem, et ero similis altissimo* is in Augustine. There seems, therefore, to be every reason for taking Augustine as the source of the com pressed form Langland used. 3 Robertson and Huppe, loc. cit., attribute the reading 'pedem' to a scribal confusion of and s rather than to an intentional alteration by Langland. However, the confusion of and s seems most unlikely from a paleographical point of view, and Langland's rephrasing of 'Ponam pedem' in the lines immediately following, 'hus fote for to sette' (G II 119), shows that * pedem' was not an error but the reading intended. The possibility of such a confusion having occurred before Langland is also remote. As the subsequent discussion will indicate, there is no evidence of such a reading before Langland. 4 'Pes animae recte intelligitur amor: qui cum pravus est, vocatur cupiditas aut libido; cum autem rectus, dilectio vel Charitas' (Enarrat. in Psalm. 9.15 [GGL 38 (1956) 66; PL 36. 124]). 'Ad ambulandum et proficiendum et ascendendum Charitas movet; ad cadendum superbia movet' (Enarrat. in Psalm. 120.5 [PL 37.1608]). 6 'Non veniat mihi pes superbiae... Sub umbr?culo alarum tuarum sperabunt filii homi num, et inebriabuntur ab ubertate domus tuae. Gum coeperit quisque isto fonte uberius irrigari, caveat ne superbiat... Quare ilium [amorem sui] pedem dixit? Quia superbiendo Deum deseruit, et discessit: pedem ipsius, affectum ipsius dixit. Non veniat mihi pes super biae' (Enarrat. in Psalm. 35.17 [GGL 38.334; PL 36.353-354[).</page><page sequence="4">388 TRADITIO creatures, failed to heed this warning. He became instead a victim of his own charms. Pride moved his love from God to self, and he fell. Ne des admovendum pedem meum [Ps. 120.3]... Hear first by what means his [foot] was moved who was among the angels, and from an angel became the devil; for, his foot being moved, he fell. What was the cause of his fall? The cause was pride. Pride, and pride alone, moves toward ruin the foot [of the soul].6 A second term which Augustine interprets as a figure of love is ' pondus. ' Weight, like foot, is a metaphor which expresses this same movement of the soul towards its goal. In a famous passage of the Confessions, St. Augustine says : Peace for us lies in good will. The body inclines by its weight toward its own place... Fire inclines upward; a stone, downward. They are moved by their weights; they seek their places... When not well ordered, they are restless; when they are in order, then they are at rest. My weight is my love; by it I am carried wherever I am carried.7 It is interesting to observe that these two Augustinian conceptions of 'pes* and ' pondus ' seem to have become so closely associated as to be virtually inter changeable. Thus in the De causa dei, Thomas Bradwardine, while purporting to give Augustine's interpretation of 'pes,' actually gives his interpretation of ' pondus. ' ' O bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard, who hath set my soul to live, and hath not suffered my feet to be moved' [Ps. 65.8-9]: my feet, that is to say, my desires and loves. But that is common in Augustine. My foot is my love; by it I am carried wherever I am carried.8 Hence, when the medieval writer approached the problem of Satan's boasted equality with God, he had available two metaphors by which that self-regarding 6 ' Ne des ad movendum pedem meum... Sed prius attende unde motus est [pes] illi qui erat inter Angelos, et moto pede cecidit, et de angelo factus est diabolus: moto enim pede cecidit. Quaere unde cecidit: superbia cecidit... Ad ruinam non movet pedem [animae] nisi superbia' (Enarrat. in Psalm. 120.5 [PL 37.1608]). 7 Confessions 13.9.10. The translation followed is that by Vernon J. Bourke (The Fathers of the Church: A New Translation 21; New York 1953). For a brief discussion of the con ception of 'pondus,' see ?tienne Gilson, Introduction ? l'?tude de saint Augustin (Paris 1943) 173-174. See also H. R. Patch, 'Consolatio Philosophiae, IV, m. vi, 23-24,' Speculum 8 (1933) 41-51. 8 'Benedicite gentes Deum nostrum, et auditam facite vocem laudis eius, qui posuit animam meam ad vitam, et non dedit in commotionem pedes meos, id est, affectus et amores meos; sed illud commune Augustini, Pes meus, amor meus, ilio feror quocumque feror' De causa Dei, ed. Henry Saville [London 1618] 481), There is of course the possibility that St. Augustine himself applied the same language to ' pes' as to ' pondus, ' but I have been unable to find any example of it. It is perhaps more probable that ' foot ' had become as well known a symbol for love as 'weight', and that this circumstance effected an interchange between the two images. Se Wetheringsett: 'pede amoris' (Summa, fol. 49r; full citation below n. 39); Ludolf of Saxony: 'pedem, id est... affectum mentis' (Vita Christi, c. xxii); Anselm of Laon: 'pedem, id est affectum mentis' (Enarrat. in Matth. 4 [PL 162.1274B]); Radulphus Ardens: 'in pedibus, id est, in affectibus' (Homil. 44 [PL 155.2101C]); St. Bruno: 'pedes, id est, affectiones ' (Expos, in epist. Pauli ad Ephes. 6 [PL 153.349C]).</page><page sequence="5">LANGLAND AND TWO SCRIPTURAL TEXTS 389 love, or indeed any love, could be described-? "pondus' and 'pes.' Guido de Golumnis adopted the former. In his Historia destructions Troiae, he wrote of Satan: 'Hie elatus superbie pondere... dixit, "Ponam sedem meam ab Aquilone et ero similis altissimo."'9 Langland followed the second alternative and wrote: ' Ponam pedem meum in aquilone, et ero similis altissimo. ' One wonders whether, in choosing this particular version, Langland was obser ving already established terminology or whether he was himself making a new combination of passages to produce a desired effect. The problem is a difficult one. Although there is some positive evidence to indicate how the line took the form it has in Langland's poem, there is only negative evidence to show who gave it that form. Thus one may suppose that 'pedem' replaced 'sedem' in the line in question because in two passages of the Enarrationes where Satan makes his customary boast, 'Ponam sedem meam,' St. Augustine applies to him the text 'Non veniat mihi pes superbiae. '10 However, this information is not particularly helpful in determining whether or not it was Langland himself who effected this combination. The only real evidence is the existence or non-existence of such a combination in other medieval allusions to St. Augustine's paraphrase. So far as the present writer is aware, no such example is to be found. Amongst a body of Latin allusion which extends all the way from a bestiary to the excommu nication of an emperor,11 there is no occurence except in Langland of the reading 'pedem' for 'sedem.' Furthermore, in English translations of the Augustinian compression of Is. 14.13-14, the alliteration is entirely dependent upon the idea of ' seat, ' and there seems to be no awareness at all of the Satanic foot. Thus the Cursor mundi reads: 'sett,' he said, 'mi sete I sail... In \&gt;e north side'; and Wil liam of Shoreham: ' He wolde sette hys sete ryche J Of north half. '12 On the basis, therefore, of what evidence is available, it would seem probable that the combi nation of the two Augustinian passages was made by Langland himself for his own artistic purposes. And these, I think, become apparent even at a rapid glance. By the substitution of 'pedem' Langland has given the line a kinetic quality which accords considerably better with Satan's warlike pretensions than the static 'sedem.' Furthermore, the use of 'pes' vastly increases the conno tations of the line. The allusion to Satan now operates in terms of his evil love 9 Guido de Columnis, Historia destructions Troiae, ed. N.E. Griffin (Cambridge, Mass. 1936) 96. 10 Enarrai, in Psalm. 1.4, 35.17 (CCL 38.2-3, 334; PL 36.68-69, 353). 11 The bestiary is MS Oxford, Bodl. Ashmole 1511, fol. 41v The excommunication is that of Henry IV by Gregory VII in 1080. Gregory says of Henry that in his pride he imitates his spiritual father, 'qui dixit, "Ponam sedem meam ab aquilone et ero similis Al tissimo."' The record here cited is actually that of the publication of the excommunication ' Delectis fratribus et coepiscopis per Principatus et Apuliam et Calabriam constitutis,' rather than the excommunication itself (Das Register Gregors VII, ed. Erich Caspar [Berlin 1920] 522). Examples of the same Satanic speech are to be found in Scriptural commentaries (Cassiodorus: PL 10.279); in treatises on the sins (Peraldus, Summa de vitiis [Lyons 1500] fol. 102'; Septuplum, MS Oxford,Univ. Coll. 71, fol. 29r; Tractatus de viciis, MS Oxford,Bodl. Laud Misc., fol. 9r; in chronicles (Guido de Columnis, loc. cit. [supra h. 9]).

Going to Westminster Satan's vaunted equality with God could not, of course, escape divine retri bution. In the mind of the commentator the vengeance visited upon Satan's boast might be seen allegorically set forth in the fate of Pharaoh and his army: ' Horse and rider He has cast into the sea... The chariots of Pharaoh and his army He has cast into the sea' (Exodus 15.1-4).13 Here also the work of the Scriptural commentator seems to have afforded Langland the raw materials of his art and perhaps even a certain measure of inspiration. After Theology has challenged the legality of the wedding of Mede and Fals, and it has been agreed that the issue is to be settled at Westminster, Fals and Favel gather together a host of questionable witnesses and look about for trans portation.. Ac thanne cared thei for caplus . to kairen hem thider, And Fauel fette forth thanne . folus ynowe; And sette Mede upon a schyreue . shodde al newe, And Fals sat on a sisoure . that softlich trotted, And Fauel on a flaterere . fetislich atired.14 Simony and Civil are accommodated in a like fashion, and the procession is completed by harnessing the Commissary to Civil's cart, and transforming Liar into a 'long cart.' Says Civil: And cartesadel the comissarie . owre carte shal he lede, And fecchen vs vytailles . at fornicatores. And maketh of Lyer a longe carte . to lede alle these othere, As freres and faitours . that on here fete rennen.15 In its incongruity and satiric violence, the scene is one of Langland's best and apparently most original. Yet it cannot be said to lack antecedents. In his Homilies on Exodus, Origen considers the allegorical meaning of the overthrow of Satan and his army (Exodus 15.1-4). Since he has already identified Pharaoh with Satan, the problem is the meaning of Pharaoh's horses, riders and chariots. 13 Rupert of Deutz says: Olim ascensorem istum "In coelum ascendam," dicentem, "et supra astra Dei exaltabo solium meum" (Isa. XIV), [Dominus] detraxit et projecit in istum aerem caliginosum' (In Exodum comment. 2.37 [PL 167.645]). 14 II 161-165. 15 II 179-182. It is not entirely easy to make out what is happening in these lines. It would appear, however, that there are two carts here described. The first is that pulled by the commissary, the business of which is to bring back easy money (see Skeat's note to C III 191). The second, into which Liar is dramatically stretched, is directed by Civil to ' lede alle these othere.' Whether this means 'to draw in a cart all these others/ or simply 'to precede' is not clear. However, since the same word 'lede/ as used two lines above in conjunction with the commissary, clearly means 'draw' and since pictorial representations of what the present writer takes to be comparable carts of sin show the forces of evil being transported in long carts (see n. 29 below), the first reading seems to him preferable.</page><page sequence="7">LANGLAND AND TWO SCRIPTURAL TEXTS 391 Horse and rider He has cast into the sea... All who are born to flesh are, figuratively speaking, horses and have their riders. There are horses whom God mounts, and these go about admonishing the word. Of these it is said [Hab. 3.8]: ' And salvation is in thy horsemen. ' There are, however, horses whose riders are the devil and his angels. Judas was a horse, and so long as his rider was the Lord, he was of the company of salvation... But when he surrendered himself to Satan... Satan became his rider, and led by his reins he began to attack our Lord and Saviour... The chariots of Pharaoh and his army He has cast into the sea; his chosen riders, his princes He has plunged into the Red Sea. Pharaoh, since he is more potent in malice and rules the kingdom of evil, drives four horse chariots... There are other 'picked riders'... of whom we have already spoken; now let us see who are the 'princes'... These princes are evil angels of the army of Pharaoh.16 Although the above interpretation of Origen becomes in a sense standard since, in Rufinus' Latin, it passes by way of Bede and Rabanus Maurus into the Glossa ordinaria,17 there is abundant evidence of a second tradition, hardly less well known, which opposes to Origen's anthropomorphic figure a quite differ ent conception. According to this second interpretation, the human element tends to disappear and the presentation takes the form of an elaborate allegory of warrior vices and vehicles. As is well recognized, the beginnings of the con ception of vices struggling for the possession of the soul are to be found in the Psychomachia of Prudentius, where the vices encounter and are defeated by the personified virtuous qualities of the soul. Of the numerous scenes of individual conflict which make up Prudentius' poem, one seems to have been of extra ordinary popularity. This scene is the dramatic entrance into battle of the gentle vice Luxuria, imperturbably strewing flowers from her bejewelled chariot, and very nearly overcoming the resistance of the ravished virtues.18 Throughout the 16 ' Equum et adscensorem proiecit in mare,., omnes, qui in carne nati sunt, figuraliter equi sunt, sed hi habent adscensores suos.

Sunt autem equi, qui adscensores habent diabolum et angelos eius. ludas equus erat, sed donee adscensorem habuit Dominum, de equitatu salutis fuit... sed ubi se diabolo substravit... adscensor ipsius effectus est Sathanas, et illius habenis ductus, adversus Dominum et Salvatorem nostrum coepit equitare...

Isti ergo "temi statores" sunt an geli nequam de exercitu Pharaonis ' (In Exod. hom. 6,2-3 [Werke VI (Leipzig 1920) 193-195]). The Biblical text used by Rufinus in his translation is a form of the Old Latin close to the version printed by Sabatier (I 164) from a Rheims Psalter manuscript. On the term 'terni statores' cf. 4 Kings 7.2 and see A. Souter, Glossary of Later Latin (Oxford 1949) 387. J. H. Baxter - G. Johnson, Medieval Latin Word List (Oxford 1934) 427, define the word (in the form ternistator) as ' title of wicked angel.' It would appear likely that it was Origen's exposition of Exod. 15.1-4 or something similar that gave to ternistatores the meaning adduced by Baxter-Johnson. In arriving at his conclusion that the 'ternistatores' are ' angeli nequam* Origen plays insistently upon the ?/iree-element in the Biblical term, 17 Bede, Expl. in Exodum 15 (PL 91.311-12); Rabanus Maurus, Comm. in Exodum 4 (PL 108.67-75). 18 Psychomachia 310-343 (in Prudentius, trans.

Thomson, I [Cambridge, Mass. 1949] 300-302).</page><page sequence="8">392 TRADITIO following centuries, the influence of the Psychomachla was immense, as has been ably demonstrated by Katzenellenbogen and Bloomfield.19 To this influence was added, almost two centuries later, that of an equally famous literary battle ? the assault of the seven deadly sins upon the 'miles Dei' in the Moralia of Gregory the Great.20 From the eighth through the twelfth centuries, the in fluences of Prudentius and Gregory combined to produce a whole series of Psychomachiae. In the works of Aldhelm, Alcuin, Theodulf of Orl?ans, in the Liber de conflictu vitiorum et virtutum and the De fructibus carnis et Spiritus, both of uncertain authorship, the now traditional theme of moral battle is stated and restated.21 But for its final form the allegorical struggle of vice and virtue was not indebted to any of the above, but to St. Bernard of Glairvaux. In the course of his Sermones in Cantica, St. Bernard has occasion to comment upon the text, ' My love, I have likened thee unto my company in the chariots of Pharaoh' (Cant. 1.8).22 This passage St. Bernard interprets as a struggle be tween the forces of the 'Arnica,' the soul and bride of Christ, and the chariots of the vices under the leadership of Satan.23 The soul, supported as it is by virtues and angelic hosts, is like an army, and, by analogy to the divinely assisted victory of the chosen people over the physical Pharaoh, may be expected to triumph over the spiritual Pharaoh, Satan. The forces arrayed against the soul are, how ever, imposing. Satan's army is led by powerful princes of vice, among whom St. Bernard singles out three for especial consideration. These are the three 'principalia vitia' ? Malice, Luxury, and Avarice. They are equipped with three splendid chariots ? or, it would appear, four-wheeled carts ? which St. Bernard allegorizes in minute detail. For example: The cart of Luxury... turns upon four wheels: Gluttony, Lust, Softness of Garments, and Laxness of Slumbrous Ease. It is drawn by two horses: Prosperity of Life, and Abundance of Things; their two postillions are Torpor of Sloth and False Security.24 19 Adolf Katzenellenbogen, Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Medieval Art (London 1939); Morton W. Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins (Lansing 1952). 20 Moralia in Job 31.45 (PL 76.620). 21 For bibliography and discussion, see Bloomfield's excellent and extremely useful index under ' Psychomachiae. ' 22 Sermones in Cantica 39 (PL 183.977-981). I have not translated 'equitatus ' in the cus tomary fashion as 'company of horsemen' because I am unable to find that St. Bernard interpreted his text in that fashion. Actually the usage of 'equitatus' about the time of St. Bernard identified it more or less with 'exercitus ' (see Du Cange, Glossarium), and Ber nard seems to observe this equivalence (op. cit. 4): 'Sed vide iam similitudinem de Pharaone et exercitu eius, et de Domini equitatu. Non inter ipsos exercitus similitudo data est' (PL 183.978). 23 One notices that such an interpretation offers certain grammatical difficulties, since 'in curribus Pharaonis ' does not accord particularly well with the idea of battle against Pha raoh's chariots. Stephen Langton (discussed below) seems to have felt this difficulty, and in his own Glossa in Cantica is at pains to show that God is fighting with the 'equitatus' against the 'currus, ' and modifies the grammatical form to fit: 'ego [Deus] militabam veluti in curribus, id est, in currus Pharaonis' (MS Oxford, Bodley 87, fol. 153r). 24 'Luxuriae vero currus quadriga nihilominus volvitur vitiorum, Ingluvie videlicet ven tris, Libidine coitus, Mollitie vestium, otiisoporisqueResolutione.

What he has ac complished is nothing less than an extraordinarily successful fusion of all the elements so far discussed. Most influential and most clearly apparent is the work of the commentators on Exodus. Origen had long before made the same association between the 'currus Pharaonis' of Exodus 15.1-4 and Cant. 1.8,25 and the idea of Satan's chariots as vices seems first to have been stated by St. Bruno in his Expositio in Exodum.26 Other elements may also be noted. The term 'principalia vitia' echoes the classical phraseology of Gregory the Great,27 while the 'currus Luxuriae' of Prudentius now appears in the ranks of Pharaoh's mobile army. Perhaps most interesting, the ' quadriga, ' the four-horse chariot of the original Origen comment, has been transformed, in accordance with con temporary military practice, into a four-wheeled cart-8 ? the vehicle known as the 'longa caretta.'29 fida Securitas' (PL 183.980). I have translated 'auriga* as 'postillion ' rather than as 'cha rioteer * because the arrangement here alluded to would seem to be that of a principal driver, in this case the 'vitium principale,* and the postiliions governing the individual horses. Illustrations of this method are to be found in the Bible Mora Us?e (cited below n. 29) and in the Hortus deliciarum, plate 5 (ed. Canon Joseph Walter [Strasbourg 1952]), where the postil lion of the chariot of the sun is labelled ' auriga.* 25 In Cant. Cant. 2 (Werke Vili [Leipzig 1925] 151). 26 'Quot enim sunt vitia, tot sunt et currus, quibus diabolus fertur' (PL 164.265). 27 The phrase 'principalia vitia* occurs repeatedly in Gregory's description of the seven deadly sins in Moralia 31.45: 'septem principalibus vitiis,* 'septem nimirum principalia vitia,' etc. 28 It is to be observed that Origen uses the reading ' quadriga ' in referring to Pharaoh's chariots, and shows that he is using the term in its classical sense by having the ' quadriga * drawn by four horses (In Exod. horn. 6.3 [Werke VI 194]). St. Bernard, however, evidently understood 'quadriga' and 'currus' as both referring to a four-wheeled vehicle. Thus he says: 'Habet namque Malitia currum suum rotis quattuor consistentem... Trahitur auteni duobus admodum pernicibus equis... Tune namque quadriga ista Malitiae' (PL 183.980). The same terminology is used in describing the four-wheeled cart of Luxuria (see n. 24 above). St. Bernard is here doubtless following established usage. In antiquity 'currus' had meant a four-wheeled wagon as well as a chariot, and in England in 1238 one finds 'currum cum quattuor rotis' (Calendar of the Liberate Rolls, Henry III: 1226-1240 p. 333). 'Quadriga' was apparently also used in this sense in St. Bernard's time. Baxter and Johnson print ' Quadriga* as meaning a four-wheeled wagon in about the year 1160 (Medieval Latin Word List 342). 29 The ' longa caretta ' seems to have been a well recognized form of military transportation. From its great length, it must, like the ' currus,' have had four wheels. Henry III maintained ten of these carts in each of the principal castles of Winchester, Bristol and Gloucester. In 1227, he gave orders for their construction, and in 1229 for their repair (Calendar of Liberate Rolls, Henry III: 1226-1240, pp. 19, 140). The carts were clearly intended for mili tary use. Thus in the Bible Moralis?e (Paris 1911) I plate 48, one may see Pharaoh advancing into the Red Sea in his long cart filled with soldiers and drawn by postillion-mounted horses. The Hortus Deliciarum of Herrad von Landsperg, discussed below, offers a similar illustra tion. For information relative to 'currus' and 'longa caretta' I am indebted to Dr. E. M.

However, St. Bernard's admirable synthesis was final only in terms of a single tradition, the Psychomachia or vice-virtue tradition. Although Herrad von Landsperg, for example, in her famous Hortus deliciarum clearly followed the later Psychoma chia tradition ? note the 'gemmatus currus Luxuriae' where the whole tradition from Prudentius to St. Bernard may be traced (see cut opposite)30 ? the opposing conception of Origen remained firmly entrenched in the Glossa Ordinaria. Wheth er the army of Satan consisted of vices or of demonic powers remained a difficult question. How many resolutions of this problem were attempted the present writer is not prepared to say. However, in England the most influential seems to have been that of Stephen Langton, later Archbishop of Canterbury. In his Commentary on the Pentateuch (ca. 1185),31 Langton addresses himself to the text basic to both traditions ? Exodus 15.1-4. He begins by summarizing from Origen the horse and rider relationship indicated at the beginning of the present dis cussion. But when he arrives at the section of Origen which deals with Pharaoh's chariots, he makes a rather surprising reading. Origen had said that whomever one might see excelling others in vice, him he would know ' de quadrigis esse Pharao nis,' i.e., one of the four horses drawing Pharaoh's chariots.32 Langton, however, quotes Origen as saying 'esse quadrigas diaboli,'33 which makes the sinner not the motive power of the chariot ? now extended into a cart ? but the cart itself. When Langton turns to St. Bernard for his second major interpretation, he makes another unusual reading. Langton finds that St. Bernard has described the great vices not so much as drivers of carts, but as the carts themselves: 'tres eius [Satanae] principes sive currus. '34 The net result of these two readings 80 The bejewelled cart, Luxury herself, and five of the cart's armed passengers, locus, Petulantia, Amor, Pompa, Voluptas, all go back to the original Psychomachia (310-444). The label 'principale vicium' seen near Luxuria's head, is due ultimately to Gregory the Great (see above n. 27), while three of the passengers, Immundicia, Turpiloquium (scurrilitas), and Mentis Excecatio (caecitas mentis), are also due to him (PL 76.621). From the later Psychomachiae further mailed passengers are drawn. Alcuin furnishes Lascivia (Liber de virtutibus et viciis [PL 101.634]) and the De conflicto vitiorum et virtutom provides Ignavia (PL 40.1092). The four-wheeled cart, the 'principale vicium' as driver of the cart show immediate and doubtless controlling indebtedness to St. Bernard (see above n. 28). The illustration is reproduced from the edition of the Hortus deliciarum by Canons A. Straub and G. Keller (Strasbourg 1879-1899), plate 47. 31 MS Oxford, Trinity College 65, fols. 110v-lllv.

Langton, however goes considerably further and quotes Bernard as identifying princes and carts: 'Nota quod</page><page sequence="12">396 TRADITIO is that both sinners and sins become identified with carts. One can only conjecture what lies behind this equivalence, but it seems clear that if both sins and sinners are viewed as carts, the opposition between the views of St. Bernard and Origen tends to disappear. By the identification of sin and cart, the devil is borne about in sin-carts in a manner similar to St. Bernard's conception and exactly com parable to that of St. Bruno; by the identification of sinner and cart, the devil may be viewed as proceeding very much as in Origen. Thus Langton maintains both the Satanic rider of Origen and the sin-cart of St. Bernard, and in this fashion he harmonizes the two traditions.35 But Langton has a further and highly significant change to make. He quietly suppresses St. Bernard's 'Malicia' and transfers her allegorical cart to 'Super bia. '36 With this change, the carts now read: Luxuria, Avaricia, Superbia ? the customary equivalents for concupiscence of the flesh, concupiscence of the eyes, and pride of life (1 John 2.16). As Langton indicates a little further on in his commentary, it is to these three vices that he wishes to make his carts conform.37 The influence of Langton's interpretation ? and in particular of his equation of the sins of 1 John 2.16 with modes of equine transportation ? can be seen in a second English theologian almost contemporary with Langton. In the Summa de officio sacerdotis of Richard de Wetheringsett (ca. 1230) one finds Satan des cribed as a driver in a fashion highly reminiscent of St. Bernard but in fact iden tical to Langton:38 'Pride may be called the devil's cart, whose four wheels are contempt of God, of one's neighbor, of one's own subjection, of ecclesiastical institution.' More important for present purposes, Satan is likewise described Pharao habet currus, habet et principes duces exercituum. Super hunc locum vero in Canticis Canticorum, "Equitatui meo assimilavi te in curribus Pharaonis, " assignat San-jtus. Bernardus qui sint currus Pharaonis et appendici a eorum. Sic Pharao est diabolus, qui est, ut dicit Dominus ad Job, rex super omnes filios superbie (Job 41.25). Tres eius principes sive currus sunt hec tria vicia: Superbia, sive Malicia, Avaricia, Luxuria* (fol. 111 ). 35 Having identified both sinners and sins as carts, Langton is now ready to show that demons are the riders. Thus he says: 4 Electi principes, etc. Principes, ut habemus, sunt vicia principalia vei deinones eis presidentes' (fol. lllv). This makes clear that the demon is the rider or driver and sin the conveyance. I do not find, however, that Langton has spe cifically shown the comparable relationship between demon and sinner. He would seem to be interested in harmonizing the two main elements of each tradition: the sin-cart of St. Bernard and the demonic rider of Origen. In this solution he is very close to the earlier interpretation of St. Bruno, to aspects of which St. Bernard is himself perhaps indebted (see above n. 26). 36 Langton begins by mentioning Malicia as an equivalent for Superbia, but after making this initial equivalence, he makes no further mention of Malicia at all. Thus: * Superbia sive Malicia... Primus ergo est currus Superbie, ' etc. (fol. lllr). The lines quoted are a con tinuation of the passage reproduced above n. 34. 37 'tria principalia vitia, scilicet, concupiscentia carnis, concupiscentia oculorum, et super bia vite' (fol. lllv). 38 It will be observed that the devil is here the driver and the vice the cart. In St. Bernard, the vice is the driver and the cart is made up of subdivisions of the vice. Satan is nowhere treated as the driver of the vice, nor in St. Bernard is there a 'currus Superbiae'(see above n. 34).</page><page sequence="13">LANGLAND AND TWO SCRIPTURAL TEXTS 397 as a horseman in terms of 1 John 2.16: ' Concupiscence of the Flesh may be likened to the devil's palfrey, Avarice to his rouncy, Pride to his war horse. '39 If we turn now from the commentators to the poet Langland, two problems seem to require consideration: (1) What evidence is there that Langland was actually familiar with the commentary in question ? (2) If he was, in what ways has he reshaped his materials? In answer to the first question, it may be stated with some confidence that evidences of both traditions are discoverable. From the sins tradition ? that is, the interpretation of St. Bernard further developed in terms of 1 John 2.16 by the English commentators ? Langland drew the three types of horse (palfrey, rouncy, war horse) on which Fals and his friends ride to Westminster. If one compares Satan's horses in the Summa de officio sacerdotis (quoted above) with those Favel produces (A text), the parallels are reasonably consistent. The war horse ' dextrarius ' appears in Langland as ' alle denes and sodenes . as destreres dihten'; the 'runcinus' or 'runcinus trottans' as 'Fais on a sysoures backe . that softly trotted'; and the 'palefridus' as 'lette apparayle prouisours . on palfreis wyse. '40 Also from the sins tradition, in this case from the allegorical four-wheeled carts, comes the 'longe carte' into which Liar is so suddenly trans formed. It seems likely that Langland, familiar with the 'longa caretta' as a traditional conveyance for militant sins, used this term to describe Liar as he bears his burden toward Westminster. It is perhaps worth suggesting that Liar's peculiar shape may be directly indebted to Stephen Langton's commentary, for in Langton, it will be remembered, the vice is not the driver of the cart, but the cart itself. Finally, as will be pointed out below, Civil and Simony would appear to be Langland's adaptation of the three 'principalia vitia' of the St. Bernard-Langton commentaries. To Origen, on the other hand, Langland's indebt edness is of a somewhat different nature; it is to be discovered less in particular resemblances than in basic conception. The central and consistent figure of the human horse ridden or driven by demon or vice ? Fals seated upon a juror, the commissary pulling Civil's cart ? has its roots in the commentary of Origen. In answer to the second question, that of Langland's use of his materials, I think two observations may fairly be made. First Langland seems to have taken the two traditions and synthesized them in a singularly effective fashion. The most difficult problem for the commentator, it has been pointed out, was the make-up of Pharaoh-Satan's army. Was it composed of sins, or was it composed of demons? Later commentators had been faced with the difficult choice of attempting to bridge the two traditions or of following one to the exclusion of the other.41 Langland, perhaps again influenced by the commentary of Stephen 39 'Currus diaboli potest dici superbia, cuius quattuor sunt rote: contemptus Dei, et pro ximi, et proprie subjectionis, et ecclesiastice institutionis'; ' Item carnis concupiscentia est q?asi palefridus diaboli, et avaricia quasi runcinus, superbia quasi dextrarius' (MS Oxford, New College 94, fol. 49r, 47v). For a brief discussion of Richard de Wetheringsett and the Summa de officio sacerdotis or Qui bene presunt, see A.L. Kellogg, 'St. Augustine and the Parson's Tale, Traditio 8 (1952) 425 . 8. 40 A II 150,135,148. For examples of the ' runcinus trotans* as a common type of rouncy, see Du Gange, Glossarium, s. . runcinus.) 41 In addition to the examples already discussed, see Rupert of Deutz: 'exercitum eius [Sathanae] tarn vitiorum quam daemonum* (PL 167.647). In this he is followed by Gerhoh of Reichersperg, Expos, in cant. Moysis I (PL 194.1021).</page><page sequence="14">398 traditio Langton,42 keeps both traditions and solves the demon-sin problem by placing the two on separate and distinct levels. Satan and his angels he simplifies into the unholy Trinity, Fals-Favel-Liar, three timeless protean figures, suggestive of the father of deceit himself, to whom he gives control over both wedding and journey. The 'principalia vitia'? Pride (Malice), Luxury, and Avarice?he converts into those sins of his own age which he considers controlling ? Simony and Civil. These become Satan's temporal agents carrying out his commands. Thus, in the company of the timeless manifold figure of deceit, the vices of the age drive on their human victims. A second observation is perhaps also worth making, and that concerns the balance of materials within Langland's synthesis. Aside from the sins Simony and Civil, which, as stated above, appear to be derived from the major vices of the St. Bernard-Langton commentaries, virtually all that the text retains of formal sin allegory is the representation of Liar as a cart, and this by virtue of its wonderfully incongruous transformation loses all contact with the spirit and tone of St. Bernard's treatment. The whole balance of Langland's presentation is in the direction of Origen's basic metaphor. On the road to Westminster it is the human rather than the abstract view which predom inates; it is the human which is saddled or cart-saddled. One is inclined to feel that Langland the satirist found in Origen's image the kind of grotesque, human, and violent metaphor he wanted for his indictment of contemporary society. With an almost Swiftian sense, he perceived in Origen's powerful inverted image of man degraded to the level of beast, a stinging fiction by which to convey the incongruity of human prostitution to evil ? of the ' up-so-down ' relationship which sin, the perversion of reason, produces. III. Conclusion Langland was very much a part and an observer of the world of his time, but he existed simultaneously and perhaps even more fully in a world of Biblical interpretation and allusion. What the present essay has sought to do is to show in a very fragmentary fashion how elements of this world entered into the fabric of Piers Plowman. It has tried to illustrate Langland the artist at work ? in one case combining passages to gain force and allusiveness, in another giving magnificent satirical point to a metaphor whose grotesqueness and vigor he felt to be at one with his own satirical style and purpose. Rutgers University. Alfred L. Kellogg 42 I have not been able to find any hint of Langland's solution except in Langton's Com mentary on the Pentateuch. Here the demons are manifestly of higher position in Satan's army than the sins, as the phrase 'demones eis [viciis] presidentes' indicates (cf. . 35above). However, if the 'eleeti principes' are both the 'principaba vicia* and the demons driving them, the relationship of demon and vice remains indefinite. This indefiniteness is continued in Langton's identification of 'adversarios' (Exod. 15.7) as 'demones et vitia* (fol. 112*). One suspects that Langton was more interested in the possibility of viewing Satan's army from two different points of view than he was in establishing a precise Satanic chain of command.</page></plain_text>
