HEIZER Department of Anthropology University of California Berkeley, California THE STEMMED, INDENTED BASE POINT, A POSSIBLE HORIZON MARKER Has the time arrived when we can set up another horizon marker in the archaeology of western United States? An examination of the literature reveals that a projectile point which we will call the Stemmed, Indented Base Point may be so considered. This short note contains a compilation of but some of the refer- ences to this type of point in western United States and is written in hopes of stimulating comments and addi- tional information. No attempt has been made to present an exhaustive distributional study of this arti- fact, but the accompanying chart lists some of its re- ported occurrences in order to point out its wide geo- graphical spread as well as its estimated age and various terms by which it is known. Of course, the question of the relationship of these points to one another is of paramount importance. In general shape the points appear to be very similar; however, written descriptions note secondary differences which may be quite significant. Fundamentally the points have the following features in common: A stem- med point with triangular body; stem narrower than body and usually parallel-sided; base of stem fairly deeply indented. Some differences noted include: The technique of chipping would appear to include exam- ples, such as the Pinto Points, which feature percussion flaking, and styles, found in Colorado and Texas, which exhibit rather fine secondary chipping suggesting pres- sure flaking. Some specimens have stems with smoothed lateral edges, while others do not possess this feature. Serrated blades are characteristic of some of the points, while others have relatively straight blade edges. The points also vary a considerable amount in size. Hurt and McKnight (1949, p. 191) have presented a discussion of the age of the Pinto type artifact fairly recently. They point out that estimates of age vary a great deal. This is also evident from an examination of the accompanying chart. However, there does seem to exist a consensus of opinion which would place the artifact in question between the Folsom and recent hori- zons. It is for this period, formerly spoken of as a "gap" in western archaeology, that the Stemmed, Indented Base Point would appear to serve as a horizon marker.

LISTER Division of Anthropology University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado TWO SITES IN WESTERN BOLIVAR, VENEZUELA The site of Cedefio is on the south bank of the Ori. noco River, approximately 1 km. northeast of the boat landing area of the town of Caicara. The Orinoco at Cedeno is marked by a series of boulders that reach, from the south bank, 100 meters or more into the river. These are uncovered during the summer (dry season) and contain petroglyphs in the form of spirals, mazes and other figures. The river at this point is marked by vertical banks 3-5 meters high. The top of the vertical bank represents the usual high-water mark of the Ori- noco; beyond this bank is a more or less level stretch of mixed fields and woodland. The river banks extend in two stages to a sloping river beach. As the water level of the Orinoco varies 10 meters or more between wet and dry season, this beach is above water for a consider- able distance during dry weather. No aboriginal structures of any sort were found at Cedeio. The sherd area extends for some 250 meters along the river front. The sherds wash out of the river banks at the bottom of the first vertical cut, at a point from 1 to 1.5 meters below the top of the bank. In widening its channel, the Orinoco is slowly destroying this site. 265</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The extent of prehistoric settlement inland from the river is unknown. Excavation for a (now deserted) oil storage tank, at about the middle of the sherd area and some 100 meters from the banks of the river, turned up a number of sherds. While digging the foundations for a house in the town of Caicara during 1951, sherds and other objects were found by the workers, but these were not examined by the writer. This particular area is more than a km. from Cedefio and several hundred meters from the Orinoco. A partial survey of the Cedenio site was made by the writer in the winter of 1950-1951. No excavation was made but a collection of some 300 sherds and other ceramic objects was taken from the river area. Sherds were found only in places where the soil had been dis- turbed by digging or where there had been river action. As there was no stratigraphy, analysis of pottery could depend only on typology. Typological comparison demonstrated a general similarity of the Cedefio mate- rial to that of the site of Ronquin, partially excavated by Howard in 1941, on the Orinoco a hundred km. to the east. It was found possible to classify the ceramic mate- rial under the two major styles outlined by Howard from Ronquin material (Howard, 1943, pp. 22-32). It was decided, however, to avoid comparison of types within these styles due to the smallness of the Cedeio sample. Most of the ceramic materials at Cedefio were placed in two types, both of which could be attributed to the late Ronquin ceramic style. Type 1. A thick grey to brown ware. The paste is coarse and non-homogeneous. It contains a considerable number of carbonaceous material and large pieces of sand and feldspar. Many pieces of this pottery show differential firing. The cores of the sherds are dark from the organic content and from insufficient firing. This pottery type is monochrome and unslipped. A striking feature of all pieces is the inclusion of rod-shaped sponge spicules of the Genus Spongilla.* These some- times occur in large bundles, oriented longitudinally. The clay of type 1 was probably a river silt in which sponge spicules often occur. There seems to have been little attempt at sorting or sifting the clay. Wall thickness of the sherds average 5-10 mm. The vessels were primarily flat and round-bottomed ollas with flat-bottomed bowls also represented. Rim forms are recurved. Most examples are thick-lipped and have a sharp interior angle. Where the lip is thinner there is the effect of an interior carina. One piece, a decorated incised sherd, has a well defined carina which forms part of the decorative motif. Other atypical examples include a wide recurved rim, a recurved rim with extra thicken- * Identification of these spicules made by Donald South, Depart- ment of Geology, University of New Mexico.

One small vertical loop handle and a number of lugs, usually in zoomorphic form, were found. Approximately 15 per cent of type 1 sherds were dec- orated. The most common decoration was in the form of appliqued ridges and rounded protruberances im- pressed with lines of dots or with a "dot in a circle" motif, made, apparently, with the end of a small reed or cane. Other decorative features include coffee-bean modeling, usually with the beans grooved. Four sherds showed parts of faces. These had eyes formed of grooved coffee-beans, eyebrows of appliqued punctated ridges, and noses of modeled mounds of clay joined to the ends of the eyebrows. Lips were separate appliqued strips. Five sherds showed examples of narrow-lined shallow incising in geometric designs, usually near the rim of the pot. Two of these are interior; most of the other decorations are on vessel exteriors. Incision takes the form of continuous zigzag lines, interwoven with short horizontal and vertical lines to form squares, triangles, and rectangles. Occasionally lines of dots, punched in the clay, will overlie one of the incised lines or will be interspersed with the incised elements. One of the in- cised pieces found at Cedefio has, essentially, the same motif as a piece pictured by Petrullo from Arauquin. (Petrullo, 1939. P1. 32, Fig. j.) Other decorative features include zoomorphic and anthropomorphic heads in rim decorations. These are crudely made; the eyes and mouth are produced by pressing with a wedge or (for the eyes) by the use of a circle and dot. Nose and ears are pinched from the base clay of the figure. Type 2. This type of pottery is light terra cotta in color. It is extremely chalky to the touch and crumbles readily. The color extends completely through the pot walls which are 5-8 mm. thick. This pottery is very well fired and is quite porous. It is possible that type 2 con- tained vegetal matter, destroyed in the firing'but giving the vessel its considerable porosity. Clay of this group is well sorted. Temper is sand and feldspar and large numbers of Spongilla spicules are again present. These are more fragmental than in type 1 and in some speci- mens are almost completely pulverized. This suggests careful grinding of the clay before the admixture of the temper. All type 2 rims are recurved with thick lips. Vessel forms were probably globular jars or ollas. No sherds from vessel bottoms were found. Only two sherds are decorated. There is, however, an adorno of this type, a modeled zoomorphic form, 5 cm. high. In this animal figure the nose is represented by a nubbin of clay, and the mouth by a shallow incised line. Eyes are made by deep narrow incised circles with eyes punched in the centers. Two figurines were found at the Cedefio site. One of these is a torso of a nude female, 9 cm. in height and 3.5 cm. thick. The body is tubular with little attempt to follow body contours. This figurine is type 1 in clay, temper, sorting, and firing techniques, and in the pres- ence of uncrushed Spongilla. The figurine has shallow depressions where arms, legs and head once were joined to the torso. These have all broken away smoothly, ex- cept for the remnant of one arm. The only body features represented are the breasts, made with appliqued mounds of clay, the navel, by a shallow depression, and the genitalia, by a punctated impression. The second figurine is a torso with one leg attached. It is terra cotta in color and of a chalky, highly fired pottery. This figurine would probably be classed with type 2 pottery. The present length is 8 cm.; the body is 4 cm. wide and 1.5 cm. thick. The piece is extremely battered and most features are gone, but it probably represented a nude female. Only eight examples of pottery that belonged to the early Ronquin style were found: five of these are parts of lugs or handles and two others are rims. These sherds are well fired and are red-brown, with the color extending evenly through the sherd wall. The examples have numerous inclusions of quartz and feldspar and these seem to have been deliberately added as temper. The paste for this pottery type had been carefully sifted and may have come from a clay pit in which fine sort- ing had already taken place. This type does not contain sponge spicules. One of the rims found is a recurved thick-lipped type, and the other is wide and recurved. The latter con- tained wide shallow incisions, spaced diagonally around the inside of the rim. Vessel shapes could not be deter- mined. The modeled pieces include a vertical loop handle, a vertical ribbon handle, and a squared knob lug. Another handle is zoomorphic; an animal head, flattened and snub-nosed, with eyes formed by shallow incised circles, each with a punctated dot in the center. Three arrow straighteners of stone were found. These are irregularly shaped pieces, one of granite and the other two of gneiss. The depressions crisscross and are ca. 1 cm. wide and from .5 to 1 cm. in depth. The Punta Brava area is 18 km. east of Caicara on the Orinoco near the mouth of the Cuchivero River. Sherds were found in a dry wash about 150 meters from the south banks of the Orinoco on farm lands belonging to Sr. Marcos Herrera of Punta Brava. The area was diffi- cult to explore because of the thick undergrowth, but a number of sherds and one figurine (possibly an adorno) were picked up along the dry watercourse. Size of the site is unknown. No structures were noted and no stone artifacts were found. Pottery is Late Ronquin in style and both Cedenio types 1 and 2 are represented. The figurine, 6 cm. high and 5 cm. wide, is badly battered, both arms and one leg having been broken off. The head is wedge shaped, 4.3 cm. in thickness. The nose is formed by pinching out a piece of clay from the head; the eyes and mouth by wedge shaped impressions. Im- mediately back of the eyes are dot and circle imprints, probably to represent ears. The figurine face is oriented at almost a right angle to the body; in other words, placed on top of the head. 267</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Charles Olvey, a missionary stationed at Caicara, un- covered a number of rim decorations and figurines while digging in a dry wash near Las Trincheras in the Caura River valley. These objects were encountered at some depth below the surface. The writer had a chance to examine three of the specimens. Two are human figures, rim decorations, grey-brown in color with crudely modeled features. They resemble similar decorations of type 1 at Cedefio. The third object is a zoomorphic form, perhaps a monkey. It is a somewhat bulky figure, 5 cm. high, 6.5 cm. thick, and 5.8 cm. wide. The color is red- brown. This piece is quite reminiscent of adornos com- mon to the Barrancos area.

The most important variation, perhaps, was the use of red and white paint on vessel walls; found in the early levels at Ronquin but missing at Cedefio and Punta Brava. Less than 3 per cent of the Cedenio sherds, however, belong to the early Ronquin style and this style was completely missing at Punta Brava. At Howard's site early Ronquin (as the name implies) pre-dates late Ronquin but it is unclear to what extent the early pottery is ancestral to the later group. Early Ronquin ceramics at Cederio might possibly rep- resent trade ware though excavation will perhaps reveal more material from this period. A tabular listing of similarities between ceramic styles at Ronquin and Cedefio include: Late Ronquin Paste Fribility Presence of Spongilla Gray to buff surface color Knob-shaped handles BIBLIOGRAPHY CRUXENT, JOSE M. 1950.
