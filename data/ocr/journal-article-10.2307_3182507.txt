<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILIPPE CRIGNON Figuration: Emmanuel Levinas and the Image The problem that concerns us here is figuration. Not the image, and not art, even though, of course, these themes are not unrelated to the ar- guments that follow. My initial hypothesis is that our current under- standing of all these phenomena would benefit from our adopting a new perspective, from our yielding neither to an aesthetic line of inquiry, full of preconceptions about the beautiful, the work, and its meaning, nor to the more recent promotion of the incarnated image, which bril- liantly summarizes a certain history but appears incapable of dealing with the new images produced during the last century (cinema, for ex- ample) and their anthropological, technical, and political stakes. This is why it seems necessary to ask a simple question: What is it that fun- damentally drives man to produce images, to leave traces that are not read but seen and that touch us-to produce not signs, but figures? Returning to the act of production-to the compulsion to figure- we can expand our field of analysis beyond the narrow sphere of art and include children's drawings, graffiti, and techniques of image produc- tion (photography, video, etc.). We can also depart, historically, from the tradition of the Christian image, of the icon and its incarnational model, so that the Lascaux paintings are as much at issue as Boltan- ski's installations or Fritz Lang's films. To orient ourselves, let us take as our point of departure a famous image on which Georges Bataille-and not Emmanuel Levinas, who will be the focus here-has extensively commented.2 It is the image 1.

The rarity of anthropomorphic images in wall paintings is a well-known enigma. For what reasons did the first people prefer to paint beasts rather than their fellow human beings? And why, in the rare cases where human beings did represent themselves, did graceful lines become contorted, arabesques rigid, and forms caricatured? One can only be astonished by the difficulties encountered in repre- senting human beings, as if they resisted imaging or figuration. Looking at the scene of the well more closely, one notices that the hand that drew it was thwarted by two poles of the human body: the face-reduced to some sort of bird's head, and the sexual organ-unrealistically erect. We will take this figure as a pretext, then, for inquiring about the ties that bind the image to the human body: Why does the image "fail" when it attempts to represent this body? Does this "failure" not teach us some- thing essential about the image-perhaps less about its representational limits than about its real vocation? Conversely, do we not find ourselves confronted with the necessity of rethinking this unfigurable human body, which is at odds with the visible, and of rethinking it on the basis of this very unfigurability, that is, on the basis of this bipolarization- the face and the erotic body-as exposure and exhibition? To begin to respond to all these questions, to finally address the problem of figuration, we will study the texts of Levinas, for three main reasons. First, because Levinas tries to found ethics by wresting the Face of man from visibility, by freeing it from the image that it is for- ever tempted to lapse into. Second, because he recognizes that if our vi- sual perception breaks down before the face of the Other, it is also de- feated by its nudity. The ethical and the erotic would stand in sharp contrast to sensible experience and would explain why no representa- tion of the human body is possible. However, the problem for us will then be knowing whether it is really possible to separate the body from the image that lays claim to it. Does not the fact that a vast iconomachy has to be waged-of which the proscription of images is an inevitable consequence-already sufficiently indicate that the image is con- stantly reborn from this body that wishes to purify itself of it? There is, then, a third reason to turn to Levinas in order to clarify the question of the image. Levinas is in fact the only philosopher of modernity who did not share in the general enthusiasm for the arts, and in particular, for painting. That he was a fierce and unwavering icono- clast leads us to suspect that he perceived, perhaps better than others, something considerable at stake in the image.</page><page sequence="3">102 Yale French Studies THE NON-PHENOMENALITY OF THE HUMAN BODY: ETHICS AND EROS It is well-known that the path Levinas invites us to take consists in be- ginning with phenomenology in order to turn it around and show its metaphysical condition: ethics. Phenomenology, which describes the constitutive activity of consciousness in each of its acts, shows its lim- its when faced with the unconstitutable. In other words, it fails when, in the heart of my world, there arrives what I could not draw from my- self, an existent [etant] whose meaning cannot be attributed to the power of a transcendental subject. This meaning can only be, precisely, that of the incommensurable, of infinite difference, of absolute alter- ity, of the Other who is not another (second) me. This alterity, strictly speaking, can never be perceived since to see is already to have-if only to have before one's eyes-and therefore to possess and to grasp, to dominate and keep. Of course, before becoming knowledge, visual per- ception is a spectacle in which I revel. But whether it is in enjoyment or in knowledge, the visible is the assimilable, the assimilated. The al- terity of the Other cannot therefore stem from any sort of visibility. The Other, as such, does not appear in my world. It does not stand out on any of my horizons, for it is not an object. And yet, unless we return to a spiritual and inaccessible interiority, distinct from a perceived body- object, or to the Cartesian idea of a physical behavior indicating a psy- chological reality and, thus, to the idea of a sign and an intelligibility of the other as an alter ego modeled on the ego, we must paradoxically concede that alterity arises in the realm of the sensible. The Other, which cannot appear, must nevertheless break in, and thus break in somewhere. This somewhere, as we know, is the face. How, then, can the prevalence of ethics over phenomenology be maintained if alterity requires a tangible support, if the face, which is irreducible to a phenomenon, must nevertheless be given in an "epi- phany"? Levinas would certainly not subscribe to the idea-the very threatening idea-of a "tangible support." And with good reason. That alterity comes about, that it is an event, undergone rather than lived, is an undeniable fact-undeniable because at the very least we know that it is the condition of possibility of all phenomena, as Husserl him- self had established.3 That it occurs implies therefore the localization 3. "The transcendental constitution of other subjects... is indispensable to the pos- sibility of an Objective world for me" (Edmund Husserl, Cartesian Meditations: An In-</page><page sequence="4">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 103 of its epiphany while excluding the phenomenality of its presentation to me. It is with the notion of expression that Levinas manages, in To- tality and Infinity, to elucidate this paradox. The face is pure expres- sion. Expression is not signification; contrary to the latter, it does not succeed the form it animates, and does not presuppose the existence of an object that, moreover, would refer to another reality. Expression pre- cedes language and the split between signifier and signified. Above all, expression leaves an impression on me. It does so first of all because it is inconceivable and unforeseeable, because none of my horizons makes it possible. Expression is therefore pure meaning and is without context.4 And the face is not a signifying phenomenon (which is what an animal face would be, signifying fear, hunger, or aggressiveness, for example). This is why Levinas can add: "In this sense one can say that the face is not 'seen.' It is what cannot become a content, which your thought would embrace; it is the uncontainable, it leads you beyond" (El, 86-87). To be sure, "the face expresses itself in the sensible," but it "rends the sensible" (TI, 198). It has "its way of incessantly upsurg- ing outside of its plastic image" (TI, 262). All of these formulations at- tempt to mke one think this necessary paradox: that absolute alterity- absolute in the sense that it is not relative to me, that it does not enter into a relation with me5-comes to me nevertheless. Or that the be- yond-this-world ("the face, which is not of the world" [TI, 198]) springs up in a place within my world. As a place, the face has a form, and as expression it undoes this very form ("The face ... breaks through the form that nevertheless delim- its it" [TI, 198]).6 We already see here what problems representation, if not the reproduction of the face, can pose for the plastic arts. On the one hand, not being a phenomenon, the face is strictly invisible, and thus unfigurable, unless it is reduced to its plastic mask, its purely troduction to Phenomenology, trans. Dorion Cairns [The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1960], 92). 4. "The face signifies by itself" (TI, 261). 5. The term "relation" is obviously not the best, but how can we do without it? Le- vinas will later confess that he prefers the term "approach" ("Interview with Francois Poirie (1986)," in Is It Righteous to Be?: Interviews with Emmanuel Levinas, ed. Jill Rob- bins [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001], 57). 6. There are numerous similar formulations; for example: "The existent breaks through all the envelopings and generalities of Being to spread out in its 'form' the total- ity of its 'content,' finally abolishing the distinction between form and content" (TI, 51). See also TI, 65-66, 74-75.</page><page sequence="5">104 Yale French Studies anatomical morphology, that which death substitutes for the face.7 On the other hand, if the face is not seen, it is at least that which sees: the orientation of the gaze is exactly reversed in the case of artistic repre- sentation, where the work-a drawing, painting, sculpture, film, or im- age of any kind-abandons itself entirely and immoderately to the eye of the spectator. There would thus be a double violence in the figura- tion of the face: the violence of a human face reduced to the somatic place of its epiphany, and the violence of the desecrating exposure of an enucleated or blind face. In fact, we should not exclude the possibility that the representation of the face, and, in its wake, perhaps all figura- tion, participates in a certain violence or an impulsive wounding [grif- furel. Indeed, violence can only be exercised on a target, a surface; but at the same time, violence can only express itself in its infinite power- lessness, its powerlessness to destroy the moral resistance of the face (TI, 197, 199). A play of commensurable forces is not yet war, but a nat- ural mechanism, foreign to evil. War and violence only appear when the Other, in its transcendence, defies the very idea of power. This tran- scendence reveals itself in human features. Levinas does not call "formlessness" [l'informel the absence of form that the face assumes,8 but, curiously, "nudity,"9 a term that suppos- edly characterizes the state of a body. In reality, the adjective "naked," when attributed to the face, designates not foremost (yet also-and this is another way of formulating the preceding paradox) the state of un- covered skin, but, on the one hand, the absence of protection or defense (the exposure to violence), and on the other, the absence of phenome- nality. However, the fact of being without form-nudity-which, as we have seen, guarantees the irreducibility of the face to the world of phenomena, also characterizes the body in its erotic dimension. Form belongs to things, objects of enjoyment or knowledge, what we can pos- sess or see. For "the forms of objects call for the hand and the grasp. By the hand the object is in the end comprehended, touched, taken, borne and related to other objects, assumes [revet] a signification, in relation 7. "The dead face becomes a form, a mortuary mask; it is shown instead of letting see-but precisely thus no longer appears as a face" (TI, 262). 8. Formlessness would be a deficiency or privation, whereas not having a form is, for the face as for the flesh, a positive determination: "The face has no form added to it, but does not present itself as the formless, as matter that lacks and calls for form" (TI, 140). 9. "The face is not resplendent as a form clothing a content, as an image, but as the nudity of the principle" (TI, 262).</page><page sequence="6">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 105 to other objects" (TI, 191).10 Form occults, offers a surface that covers a depth, a front hiding what lies behind: "Beneath form, things conceal themselves" (TI, 192). The face and sexual organs break with this uni- versal morphology by presenting themselves in the mode of nudity: they expose themselves, diversely no doubt-and Levinas does not fail to point out everything that sets them in opposition. Yet the sexual or- gan, no more than the face, does not hide behind forms: "In the caress ... the body already denudes itself of its very form, offering itself as erotic nudity" (TI, 258).11 The caress is not prehension, it grasps noth- ing, and does not expect anything from the thing; it is a contact that holds back, for what it touches-what it approaches [ce a quoi elle touche]-is no less scarcely a phenomenon than the face itself. And the paradox that we have noted with respect to the face also applies to the erotic body: naked, without form, the sexual organ that takes us beyond phenomena manifests itself-exhibits itself-in the sensible world that it rends.12 We can understand, then, that it is with the same vocabulary and with similar conceptual schemas that Levinas first describes the ethi- cal encounter (with the face) and the erotic encounter (with the sexual organ). Both dismantle the status of the transcendental subject that confronts them, as well as its sovereignty, so true is it that the "I think" always hides a self-satisfied "I can" (predict, grasp, modify, utilize . .). Each of them introduces the same destabilization, and it is once again a single term that Levinas will employ several pages later to define this destabilization: "My arbitrary freedom reads its shame in the eyes that look at me" (TI, 252). This is the effect of the face-to-face. It should be compared with the following formulation: "The shame of profanation 10. It is to be noted that, for Levinas, the verb "revetir" is not limited to its most com- mon usage [to assume, take on, a given characteristic], but also suggests that form, sig- nification-Sinngebung-would clothe phenomena. Clothing or uniform insures inte- gration within the same. Thus, it is opposed to the nudity of the face and the sensual flesh. These, because they express an infinite alterity, do not assume [or "put on"] any signifi- cation. 11. On the preceding page we read: "The caress consists in seizing upon nothing, in soliciting what carelessly escapes its form toward a future. .." (TI, 257). 12. The caress, as a mode of access to the erotic body, is "a relation yet, in one aspect, sensible" (TI, 258). "The caress, like contact, is sensibility. But the caress transcends the sensible" (TI, 257). The sensual is no more sensible than the face is visible. To be sure, there is always, "in one aspect," as Levinas would say, a vision of the face (this expres- sion recurs several times in Totality and Infinity), but it is "the vision of the very open- ness of being, it cuts across the vision of forms and can be stated neither in terms of con- templation nor in terms of practice" (TI, 193).</page><page sequence="7">106 Yale French Studies lowers the eyes that should have scrutinized the uncovered" (TI, 260). This is the effect of exhibited flesh. Shame, a common effect of shared nudity, points to the singular relationship that unites the human face and the sexual organ of the other. That the one and the other are for- mally opposed, that the shame they incite does not have the same meaning on both sides, should not make us forget what links them, what even renders them indissociable, for it is precisely in this sharing alone that their asymmetry can be understood. If both the face and the sexual organ are characterized as non-phe- nomena, if all form is taken away from them, and if therefore any pos- sibility of seeing or grasping them is ruled out,13 we can understand why the figuration of the human being runs up against these two poles, how it can only be problematic. A line cannot possibly follow what eludes the gaze. No technique, be it manual or not, can retranscribe or record the invisible. To understand the ethical and the erotic is to con- sent to the collapse of the aesthetic. The face and the sexual organ, as the man of Lascaux seems to suggest, are unfigurable. Not that the rest of the human anatomy remains entirely untroubled. On the contrary, as Levinas makes clear, "the whole body-a hand or a curve of the shoulder-can express like the face" (TI, 262). It would be absurd if the face were the only part of the body that must not be struck! Similarly, as we shall see, the erotic charge can contaminate other parts of the body (to say nothing of fetishism, as, for example, in the disturbed per- ception that Flaubert had of the female foot), the whole body and the face itself. We would thus be led to extend the impossibility of being figured to the human body as a whole. Anthropomorphism would be excluded from the plastic arts, or more precisely, would be beyond their reach. However-and even if certain religions turn this factual impossibility into a proscription-all of art history contradicts such a conclusion, be- ginning with two of the most important pictorial traditions that our culture has known, namely, the tradition of the portrait, 14 on the one hand, and the tradition of the nude, 5 on the other. Thus, it is not sufficient to establish the non-phenomenality of the face and the sexual organ, their invisibility in a non-metaphorical 13. "Voluptuousness profanes; it does not see" (TL, 260). 14. See, for example, Tzvetan Todorov, Eloge de l'individu. Essai sur la peinture fla- mande de la Renaissance (Paris: A. Biro, 2000). 15. See, for example, Kenneth Clark, The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (New York: Pantheon, 1956).</page><page sequence="8">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 107 sense, nor the apparently insurmountable pitfalls that this creates for their representation. We must still understand why they are figured nonetheless. Simply put, this is because the obstacles to figuration re- veal what figuration is, because one suspects figuration to be compul- sively anthropomorphic-face and sexual organ, ethical and erotic- before being an aesthetic operation. Curiously, Levinas comes down here on the side of someone like Bataille, from whom, however, almost everything separates him. Nevertheless, Bataille, in his own way, linked sacred trembling and erotic spasms to figuration.16 To be sure, their points of departure are diametrically opposed: Bataille, in fact, be- gins with the image (the Lascaux paintings or Manet) and draws out the sacred stakes of the game; and he can do this because he situates him- self from the outset within the religious and ritual spheres he is inves- tigating. Levinas, for his part, undertakes to describe what is before all possible images and representations at the very moment he admits that the erotic body contains the possibility of figuration. How can the fact of figuration be understood, once the non-phe- nomenality of the face and sexual organ is admitted? What is required here, as we can now see, is that the work of art not be a representation or an image as Levinas understands them. In order to elucidate the close ties that unite art, ethics, and the erotic, however, we will once again follow Levinas. We will see that it is in the interference of sexuality with the face-to-face that beauty is produced, a beauty that art will, ac- cording to him, continually present, put into form, render visible. Con- sidering art, then, as a poetry that charms, bewitches, and evacuates responsibility [deresponsabilise], Levinas will condemn it without reservation. It is by putting the two texts to work-beginning with To- tality and Infinityl7-that we will try to see how such a judgment could have been informed and what the meaning of such an exclusion is. To be sure, the question of art is not essential for Levinas: no analy- sis of his deals with it after 1948, but several times, and often in criti- cal places, the work of art (essentially plastic, as we shall see) intervenes in order to underscore a contrast or conclude a remark. Let us state in 16. For example, in L'erotisme, Bataille speaks of the Lascaux painting and links it to profanation: "The play of figuration was a response to the play of transgression" (83). 17. We will later address the essential modifications contributed by Otherwise than Being and the texts surrounding it. The work of art is partly rehabilitated there, from the moment that Levinas acknowledges its expressivity, similar in kind to that of cultural objects and gestures. But the image remains that which makes us forget the other. Let us recall, though, that Levinas devoted two texts to the painters Atlan and Sosno.</page><page sequence="9">108 Yale French Studies advance that these texts offer two means of access to the question of art. The first considers the work of art as a particular case of the work [l'oeuvre] in general. As such, the work of art assumes a signification but no longer expresses anything; it is an image in the sense of repre- sentation. The second follows the trace of beauty-from its appearance in the epiphany of the female face to the grace of the work of art-which is immediately declared superficial since it is the beauty of a surface, of an image. The question of the work, then, and the question of the beautiful, even when combined, do not suffice to question the work of art in its essence. These two paths reveal, no doubt, not so much the failure of a certain method as the irreducibility of the work of art to an essence, the impossibility of gaining access to art by metaphysical means, and the fact that any metaphysics finds itself in the end obliged to denounce it. DOUBLE NUDITY The absence of form, nudity, can be understood in two ways.l8 In the case of the face, it is destitution, exposure, and distress, but also reve- lation, full presence, and laying bare, irreducible to the phenomenal world that I constitute. The face-to-face introduces the amorphous, the existent [etant] par excellence, in other words, that which is not the ob- ject of a Sinngebung, which is not integrated into the world of signifi- cations because it is the absolute expression of a presence. As meaning per se, however, the face is also the origin of meaning, of language, and thus of phenomena and the world. Invisible, it is the origin of visibility. Devoid of form, it makes forms possible. Nevertheless, the epiphany of the face that occurs in the present of the face-to-face seems con- demned not to survive itself: "I will not always be here," says the face in its extreme fragility. Death or history threatens discourse and its truth. In the final analysis, the necessity of finding an alterity that averts its neutralization by history and the pitfall of death is what im- pels Levinas to seek a "beyond the face," which he finds in what he names Eros. The erotic body is also without form, but in a way completely dif- ferent from that of the face. What is exposure for the one is exhibition 18. If not in three ways, but the third-the nudity of things, their absence of deco- rum-is metaphorical ("Things are naked, by metaphor, only when they are unadorned" [TI, 74]), which, again, is enough to say that the nudity of the face and the nudity of the sexual organ are (also) literal.</page><page sequence="10">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 109 for the other. For the one, nudity expresses frankness and vulnerabil- ity; for the other, it is shamelessness, indecency, and ambiguity. This is because, according to Levinas, the nudity of the sexual organ is "pro- fanation," a term that places us right away in the domain of the sacred: profanation uncovers what should have remained hidden, what there- fore remains hidden even when uncovered. The sexual organ is, at once, too much and too little for the eye. In its exhibition, it imposes on the gaze an excess of materiality that explodes all form, an "ultramaterial- ity" that is "exorbitant," to use Levinas's term. Nudity becomes cru- dity, irreducible to the acclimation under which every phenomenon ap- pears. It is thus not a phenomenon, and even less an accident (to be undressed), but the way of being of the sexual organ. Conceptual rigor forces us here to say that the erotic approach brings us into relation, not with a phenomenon, but with an epiphanyl9-another word that Eros shares with its double, the face. There remains nevertheless a differ- ence, in that while the face expresses itself, the sexual organ profanes. The face-to-face is not the body-to-body. In its sacrilegious dimension, the body that offers itself naked reveals that it hides or continues to hide what it shows, and for this reason expresses nothing. However, love and desire are directed at the other. They address themselves to a person: the erotic body is first a body that has a face. The profanation of the exhibited sexual organ points toward the ex- pression of the face and is possible only because of it: "Elements and things remain outside of respect and disrespect. It is necessary that the face be perceived for nudity to acquire the non-signifyingness of the lustful" (TI, 262). Here Levinas establishes the ethical implication in the erotic. That this implication is reciprocal is something Levinas would never admit, but it is also perhaps here that metaphysics, in its need for a first principle and a simple origin, finds its limits. The sexual organ thus does not efface the face: it would disappear along with it. But it is its parasite; it introduces confusion, a double meaning, equivocation, and suspends discourse, provoking an am- biguous silence. Voluptuousness is equivocal in that it is at once en- joyment or consumption and their exact opposite: self-dispossession (as in Bataille's notion of the orgasm [la "petite mort"-literally "little 19. "An epiphany of the Beloved, the feminine is not added to an object and a Thou antecedently given or encountered in the neuter, the only gender known to formal logic. The epiphany of the Beloved is but one with her regime of tenderness" (TI, 256). It is else- where stated, for example, that "equivocation constitutes the epiphany of the feminine" (TI, 264). This expression is used repeatedly in Totality and Infinity.</page><page sequence="11">110 Yale French Studies death"], although it is true that Levinas refuses the idea of ecstasy).20 We have seen that a caress is not a seizure, but a hand that seeks with- out ever finding. This is not because of a defect-unless we stubbornly insist on a schema where taking possession remains the norm, in which case it does in fact correspond to a failure-but because a caress is not the first movement of grasping. It is rather a radically different way of approaching the other, the particular self-sufficient way of relating to the other's flesh. From this proposition, Levinas concludes that Eros does not put me in relation with anything that is a presence, an exis- tent, but, on the contrary, with something that always eludes me in a "later," that is always to come.21 In the end, it is not the face (the rela- tionship of Me to You) that institutes the most radical alterity, but sex- uality (where the Me abandons itself in its own fecundity):22 "In sexu- ality the subject enters into relation with what is absolutely other ... with what remains other in the relation and is never converted into 'mine' (TI, 276). THE IMAGE AS ORNAMENT OF THE BODY We have only apparently strayed from the question of figuration. In fact, if we recall what the man of Lascaux orients us toward-the figu- ration of two unrepresentables, the face and the sexual organ, or to put it differently, anthropomorphic figuration, figuration as anthropomor- phism-we come back to the amorphous double epiphany that Levi- nas describes, or rather to the coincidence of these epiphanies as the advent of figuration. If by its ontological structure (the face is an exis- tent-the existent par excellence-whereas the carnal is no longer one at all)23 and its particular temporality (the face-to-face is played out in the present whereas the erotic relation opens an absolutely new fu- 20. See TO, 41. 21. It is not the verb "to be" that is inadequate, when used in reference to the flesh of the other, but the present participle of the existent [l'etant]. The sexual organ does the same "work" ["metier"] of being as the face-to use an expressive term of which Levi- nas is fond-but does not partake of the same temporality. Following the example of the present and past participle, we would need to invent a future participle to designate the ontological status of the erotic body: a "serant." 22. Another problem: Is fecundity the only perspective of an authentic Eros? The question is whether absolute alterity is maintained without the inspiration of paternity. One can argue against Levinas that a non-procreative sexuality does not end up in pos- session (whose very "possessiveness" would arguably indicate a powerlessness), and that it is, in its way, an indefinitely reiterated defection and a temporization. 23. "Intheface, the existentpar excellence presents itself" (TI, 262). On the contrary, "in the carnal given to tenderness, the body quits the status of an existent" (TI, 258).</page><page sequence="12">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 111 ture),24 the transcendence of the Other is not that of Eros, the erotic body nevertheless refers to the face. The latter is thus not impermeable to sensuality. No doubt we can even add that the greatest sensuality springs up where it should manifest itself the least, in its greatest pro- fanatory force, namely, in the face. Nothing is more erotic than a face become lascivious, for this is the greatest transgression. The eroticized, or "feminine" face,25 as Levinas says, is at once the beginning and the culmination of eroticism. In it, "the purity of expression is already trou- bled by the equivocation of the voluptuous" (TI, 260). Let us finally quote the passage that concerns us here: This presence of non-signifyingness in the signifyingness of the face, or this reference of non-signifyingness to signifyingness-where the chastity and decency of the face abides at the limit of the obscene yet repelled but already close at hand and promising-is the primordial event of feminine beauty, of that eminent sense that beauty assumes in the feminine, but which the artist will have to convert into "weightless grace" by carving in the cold matter of color or stone, where beauty will become calm presence, sovereignty in flight, existence unfounded for without foundations [sans fondements car sans fondations]. [TI, 263] The beautiful is thus the equivocation of a decency troubled by voluptuousness, the equivocation of nudity itself, secretive and desti- tute all at once. The first moment of beauty does not reside after all in works of art-and even less in nature-but in the feminine, that is, in Eros. And even though it is not a phenomenon, it comes to be in the immediate proximity of the face. The work of art is only beautiful with reference to this original beauty. We see, then, that the itinerary con- ceived by Levinas to lead to the question of figuration-or rather, one of the two itineraries leading there-includes three stages: the face in its uprightness, the face besieged by equivocation, and the work of art. 24. "The encounter with the Other as feminine is required in order that the future of the child come to pass from beyond the possible, beyond projects.... The relation with the child-that is, the relation with the other that is not a power, but fecundity-estab- lishes relationship with the absolute future, or infinite time" (TI, 267-68). 25. The identification of the lascivious and the feminine-which is neither a simple residual bias nor an inessential characterization for the very meaning of alterity-can- not be taken up here at any length. To see in it a metaphor does not resolve the situation, since the reasons for the metaphor would still have to be specified. And it is not certain that a correction like the one put forward by Levinas twenty years later makes the prob- lem any easier ("Perhaps, on the other hand, all these allusions to the ontological differ- ences between the masculine and the feminine would appear less archaic if, instead of dividing humanity into two principles... they signified that the participation in the mas- culine and in the feminine were the attribute of every human being" [El, 68]).</page><page sequence="13">112 Yale French Studies This development is nothing like a straight line, a route that could be traced out on a single surface. From one station to another, the level [plan] changes-that is, at once the level and the visual features. And the operation that enables movement from one state to another is what Levinas calls conversion, or, more precisely still, inversion. Thus, after describing "this inversion of the face in femininity" (TI, 262),26 he de- clares that "the beautiful of art inverts the beauty of the feminine face" (TI, 263). The work of art thus has a genealogy, it is the face doubly in- verted (which is not a return to its initial position). Put forth thus, the concept of inversion requires some clarification. It does not mean a contrary (contraries are constituted within a com- mon genus, but no generic or preliminary concept can contain the epiphany of the face), but already a substitution, a supplanting in which a reference to the original epiphany is perpetuated. If sensuality disfig- ures the face, this disfiguration still "refers to the face" (TI, 262). More- over, inversion implies an order and a priority. It is an irreversible movement: first there is the face, and then its complication in the fem- inine, the reverse not being possible. What substitution occurs, then, in the artistic process? And at the heart of this new "disfiguration," of this second-and as if squared-"disfiguration" (which is strictly speaking equivalent to figuration), what reference to the feminine face, to the double, troubled epiphany of the sexual Other is maintained? For Levinas, art substitutes an image for the feminine that lives, ex- poses itself, and exhibits itself all at once. In a clear, distinct manner, he only conceives of artistic activity as a plastic immobilization, a molding of what, by essence, could not and should not be fixed. The carnal that escapes toward an absolute future, in the obscurity and mys- tery that the caress of the lover touches without ever grasping, is ab- sorbed here in a simple thing, that is, in a simple form. The skin that troubles is inverted into a surface. And the surface, itself, no more ex- poses than it exhibits; on the contrary, it masks. Behind its forms the work of art hides an inert matter, marble or colors: "[The beautiful of art] substitutes an image for the troubling depth of the future, of the 'less than nothing'... announced and concealed by feminine beauty. It 26. Inversion, reverse, reversal, contrariety [inversion, envers, retournement, re- bours] are all equivalent terms describing these essential alterations. "As the reverse of the expression of what has lost expression, [the non-signifyingness of the lascivious] thereby refers to the face" (TI, 264); "The hidden. .. is beyond the personal and like its reverse" (TI, 264). Correlatively, from the face-to-face to the body-to-body, subjectivity is subjected to a "reversal" (TI, 270).</page><page sequence="14">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 113 presents a beautiful form reduced to itself in flight, deprived of its depth" (TI, 263).27 Art is a fall into the world of forms, thus a degrada- tion, a paganism, an idolatry. For the work of art gives itself to be seen but remains, itself, blind or enucleated. The work does not see us, does not look at us28-and thus does not reveal anything. This return to mor- phe is a return to visibility. A painting, a statue can be seen as authen- tic phenomena. They can be circumvented, for the image does not har- bor any infinity: as finitude and an object of enjoyment, the work of art allows for the reconstitution of an ego without any facing alterity. Strictly speaking, the fact that the image is a phenomenon isolates it from the face from which it derives. But is the image not also in the likeness of that of which it is an image? Here the problem of mimesis is raised in an original manner. For it is no longer a question of con- ceiving of it as the representation of an object, a theme, or a model. It is thus the meaning of the image itself that requires a new under- standing. The "resemblance" of the image is nothing more than its quasi-umbilical link with the animated face, and this is what needs to be explained. The inversion of feminine beauty in the work of art re- tains its reference to this original beauty. Granted, all art is plastic, but all art is the figuration of femininity, that is, portrait and nude, an- thropomorphism (which we define once and for all as the figuration of the double epiphany of the face and the sexual organ). What does it mean to be a resemblance here, when we no longer understand it as a "realist" representation, a reproduction or copy? In Levinas's article en- titled "Reality and Its Shadow," this resemblance is distinguished from the sign, which, for its part, is transparent. Resemblance has a certain opacity: we look at the image, we do not look through the image. It is neither an existent (it is not that of which it is an image) nor a pure noth- ingness; it is the double of reality, its shadow, its obscuring. Figuration would thus be only a putting into form,29 an imaging, an inscription in the sensible: a surface that is not even skin but sensitized film, a nega- 27. In an earlier text, dating from 1948, and which is like the first investigation of art by ethics, Levinas already describes the artistic process in terms of substitution: "The most elementary procedure of art consists in substituting for the object its image" ("Re- ality and its Shadow," CPP, 3). 28. Levinas speaks of "the gods immobilized in the between-time of art, left for all eternity on the edge of the interval, at the threshold of a future that never occurs, statues looking at one another with empty eyes, idols that, unlike Gyges, are exposed and do not see" (TI, 221-22). 29. "Beauty becomes a form covering over indifferent matter, and not harboring mys- tery" (TI, 263).</page><page sequence="15">114 Yale French Studies tive of the real, a photo-graphy. And so also a snapshot [instantane]. To the living presence of the face, to the absolute future to which the fe- male body opens, one must oppose the immobility of the work of art, its suspension in the "meanwhile." If we study its temporal aspect, the inversion of feminine beauty through which the work of art is engendered reveals once again the two moments of substitution and internal reference. Immobile image of mobile time, the work of art does not exist under the aspect of eternity, but in suspense, in the interval. The temporality of the work of art is bridled: not a living flux but the repetition of an instant always identi- cal to itself. The Mona Lisa will never finish her smile. But Levinas adds: hence a rhythm.30 That suspense is also a rhythm (that is, a tempo, a temporalization) should not be surprising. Rhythm is the im- age of life; it is neither life nor time but their imitation, their carica- ture.31 Immobility cannot dominate the temporal mode of the work of art, for it would render it ineffective. The work integrates, therefore, a form of temporal flow that is not life (neither a presence, nor a future authentically to come, irreducible to the present and its possibilities or projects, unanticipatable), but something that nonetheless aspires to life. A vivacity, an aping of time, or what Levinas calls "caricature." This "caricature" nevertheless fascinates, captivates, and charms its spectator. Through rhythm, through the repetition of the same, the work of art makes us leave the reasonable world of the face-to-face and regress to a state of elementary hedonism. Seized and as if bewitched (witches, for Levinas, are accountable for a bad alchemy in which the 30. "Every work of art is painting and statuary, immobilized in the instant or in its periodic return. Poetry substitutes a rhythm for feminine life" (TI, 263). "The hold that an image has over us" is, writes Levinas already in 1948, "a function of rhythm" (CPP, 5). 31. "The artwork does not succeed, is bad, when it does not have that aspiration for life which moved Pygmalion. But it is only an aspiration. The artist has given the statue a lifeless life, a derisory life that is not master of itself, a caricature of life .... Every im- age is already a caricature" (CPP, 9). This is not Levinas's last word on art but, quite the contrary, his first. The partial rehabilitation to which he will agree after Totality and In- finity-culture's taking on a signal ontological function (assembling of being, celebra- tion of being, whose comprehension it renders possible) and a new meaning ("Significa- tion and Sense" [translated as "Meaning and Sense," CPP, 75-107] makes of the cultural work an expression, something that was until then the prerogative of the face)-does not put into question its secondary, inferior position precisely because, if culture governs on- tology, it remains indifferent to ethics, and thus to transcendence. The theses of the 1948 article, although belonging to the first period, are posterior to the lectures published in Time and the Other and are connected to the unchanged principles of Levinasian ethics. Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being assume and refer to these theses.

Art is foreign to discourse, retaining only its material, words, to play with. It is guilty of a rhetoric (verbal, plastic, or sonorous) that subverts language and digests every alterity. We are surprised to see that it is not "woman," sexuality, the exor- bitant exhibition of the other's sexual organ-of the other sex-that fascinate and subjugate, according to Levinas, but paradoxically, the work of art, which, let us recall, is its visible reverse: a painting or film, for example. We should here distinguish charm from seduction, a term that Levinas never uses but that appears to correspond to the power proper to the feminine. The image constrains me permanently when Eros-rather than imprisoning me or coaxing me, that is, rather than confining me in the instant-exiles me, separates me from myself, and invites me to the adventure of a future and an absolute time (fecundity, paternity). It leads me there, which means it seduces me.33 THE TWO PRINCIPLES OF THE ICONOCLASM OF TOTALITY AND INFINITY That the inversion of the sensual into the work of art is interpreted as image and resemblance, as a return to forms and visibility, makes the condemnation of art inevitable. But such an interpretation is only pos- sible if we accept two principles that, themselves, lead us back to a com- mon postulate. At the moment when Levinas advances, in an original way, the idea that artistic beauty is inherited from the beauty of the feminine, he makes it into the attribute of a substance, the adjective of a substan- tive, the quality of a product. The beautiful is inherited from the fem- inine but is inscribed in a work, and thus in a form, a visible object. And it is its meaning as work that ultimately ruins, at a first stage, the work of art. It is like a particular case of the genus opus. Now, as Levinas in- sists fairly strongly, the work is a loss, it can no longer help itself, it is 32. "To poetic activity-where influences arise unbeknown to us out of this none- theless conscious activity, to envelop it and beguile it as a rhythm ... where in a dionysiac mode the artist (according to Nietzsche's expression) becomes a work of art-is opposed the language that at each instant dispels the charm of rhythm and prevents initiative from becoming a role. Discourse is rupture and commencement, a breaking of the rhythm that enraptures and transports the interlocutors-prose" (TI, 203). 33. If Eros ravishes (rapture or ravishing is not capture or captivity), it does so "be- yond every project" (TI, 264).</page><page sequence="17">116 Yale French Studies no longer supported by living speech. Whether a dead letter or a still life [Lettre morte, nature morte], the product-be it artistic or not-es- tranges from itself everything that guaranteed alterity. The work of art is a work to which is simply added a new aesthetic quality, beauty;34 and the latter does not at all put into question its meaning as work, which is foremost. Levinas reveals himself here to be a strict aestheti- cian. The work of art is a beautiful work. And, like everything that man makes, no expression, no expressivity radiates in its breast. The face has disappeared: "The work does not defend itself against the Other's Sinngebung, and exposes the will that produced it to contestation and unrecognition; it lends itself to the designs of a foreign will and allows itself to be appropriated" (TI, 227). The absence of the author in the re- sult of his work marks his refusal to express himself, and thus to ad- dress himself to the spectator,35 and his retreat behind forms. The eth- ical relation is only produced between interlocutors, in the vis-a-vis, and vanishes in aesthetic contemplation. The second principle on which is based the process of inversion as it is described by Levinas suggests that inversion institutes an onto- logical order and priority. First comes the face, then its reverse, the fem- inine. First the feminine then its reverse, art. First language then its reverse, laughter (the heavy silence of equivocations).36 By contrast, al- terity, for example, is not derived from identity and is thus not its re- verse.37 The carnal needs the face to subsist and refers to it, but the in- 34. Beauty becomes decoration and clothing, ornament-which is why nature can borrow this beauty. To bring the question of art back to that of beauty, as Levinas does in this context, is to deny oneself any means of access to the problem of figuration. This par- tiality is confirmed, for example, in the following passage: "The aesthetic orientation man gives to the whole of his world represents a return to enjoyment and the elemental on a higher plane. The world of things calls for art, in which intellectual accession to be- ing changes into enjoyment, in which the Infinity of the idea is idolized in the finite, but sufficient, image. All art is plastic. Tools and implements, which themselves presuppose enjoyment, offer themselves to enjoyment in their turn. They are playthings [ jouets]: the fine cigarette lighter, the fine car. They are adorned by decorative arts; they are immersed in the beautiful, where every going beyond enjoyment reverts to enjoyment" (TI, 140). The impasse described here by Levinas is not that of art but of aesthetics. 35. "Through works alone the I does not come outside; it withdraws from it or con- geals within it as though it did not appeal to the Other and did not respond to it, but in its activity sought comfort, privacy, and sleep" (TI, 176). 36. "Thus silence is not a simple absence of speech; speech lies in the depths of si- lence like a laughter perfidiously held back. Silence is the reverse of language" (TI, 91). 37. "The other sex is an alterity borne by a being as an essence and not as the reverse of its identity" (TI, 121). It is indeed Eros that answers the question: "Does a situation exist where the other would not have alterity only as the reverse side of its identity, would</page><page sequence="18">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 117 verse implication would not be true. Similarly, artistic activity pre- supposes that we have already encountered erotic desire, but the latter is primary and self-sufficient. Refusing mutual implication means that a world without erotics and a world without art are possible, that the face can present itself in its uprightness without being threatened by obscenity, and that, at bottom, a pure expression, an origin of meaning, exist in it. Now, it is not clear that this is the case. When Levinas, on several occasions, grounds alterity not in the epiphany of the face but in the epiphany of the feminine,38 does he not express their co-originarity? The saltus that leads us back before ontology and phenomenology, be- fore being and phenomena, opens not only on the face-to-face, but on a face that shares the same skin as the sexual organ, a face that is itself skin. There is nothing prior to the erotic relation, not even a face. Or rather, the face only shines in proximity to an experience of desire. It then shines as primordial even though it was never able to manifest it- self as pure and free of all equivocation. A literal meaning is a chimera, or rather, it is the anteriority that never came to be, the immemorial before, of figurative meaning.39 This being the case, inversion con- serves its meaning but henceforth goes hand in hand with a co-origi- narity of the epiphanies in question. We must therefore recognize that the inversion that leads to the beautiful work, the work of art, demands an equally reciprocal necessity. Art, then, no longer has the contin- gency to which Totality and Infinity had confined it; it is as originary as the face or Eros, as the encounter with the Other, that it figures. There is no world without the adventure of art, without anthropomor- phism, any more than there is a world without the Other. Levinas does not follow this path that binds figuration to the Other. Yet, Totality and Infinity leaves unresolved difficulties to which the image is not unrelated. Thus, in this work our relation to the other is conceived as a relation to the face, a pure existent, a substance of Ko0'oavro. But can we use the category of relation without, at the same not comply only with the Platonic law of participation where every term contains a same- ness and through this sameness contains the other?" (TO, 85). 38. The erotic relation founds transcendence (TI, 276). The feminine is "the origin of the very concept of alterity" (EI, 66, where Levinas refers to the theses of Time and the Other). 39. This is, of course, the teaching of Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans. Gay- atri Chakravorty Spivak (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976), and Speech and Phenomena, trans. DavidAllison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973).</page><page sequence="19">118 Yale French Studies time, situating ourselves in rationality, the logos, and representation in consciousness? If the face of the Other can be free of all disturbance, without equivocation, without a body, how could it touch me? But, conversely, if it can touch me, if the face is body, if it weds the skin that calls forth the caress, is it not already a tangible production, already fig- uration? Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence, and notably its cen- tral chapter, "Sensibility and Proximity," attempts to go back beyond the hesitations of Totality and Infinity and to think the approach of the Other no longer in a formal manner, as a relation, but in a material and tangible manner. And yet the image always returns, as a drawing or trace, to threaten the purity or holiness of the Other. This is why, each time Levinas speaks of the face, he does so to oppose it to the image. Iconoclasm is now replaced by a great iconomachy. THE PROHIBITION AGAINST IMAGES: THE IMAGE AND ITS BODY In Totality and Infinity, Levinas acknowledges that the beauty of the work of art is inherited from the beauty of the feminine, and therefore that figuration prolongs the epiphany of the Other's body by inverting it. One might be tempted-and many, from Hegel through Benjamin to Georges Didi-Huberman, have taken the trouble-to say of the figural what Levinas has said of the face: that a painting is more than a visible phenomenon, that it opens onto an invisible sphere, that it looks at me at least as much as I see it, which, despite the divergent formulations that express this-icon, "sensuous presentation of the Idea," incar- nated image, "aura"-amounts to a common determination in which a near binds itself to a far and an invisibility is enacted within the vis- ible. Why does Levinas not follow this path? Why does the image re- main tied to the model of representation, in the domain of art as well? Why, finally, does he remain an iconoclast? To evoke here the Jewish tradition of proscribing images is not inappropriate to the extent that Levinas himself refers to it in an article from 1981, "The Prohibition against Representation and the 'Rights of Man.' "To be sure, one should not be content with drawing a parallel between an iconoclastic posi- tion and a religious affinity. It is rather a question of analyzing what, at the heart of Jewish thought as Levinas elaborates it, authorizes the judgment [proces] of images. The article begins with an explicit reference to the "Jewish tradi- tion" and specifies right from the start the limits of the prohibition</page><page sequence="20">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 119 against images as understood by this tradition. This prohibition does not concern the illustrations or descriptions of which scientific think- ing must make use in order to progress: "All representation is autho- rized when it is a question of scientific research" (AT, 121-22). Conse- quently, the forbidden images are those that have an end only in themselves, those that are produced not to illustrate or make known but to be seen [se donner a voir]. This clarification that Levinas intro- duces at the outset encourages us, then, to understand proscription as the prohibition of figuration (the production of ostensible figures: works of art, ornaments, icons, figurines, etc.). However, it is still in the name of a representation-image, an informative image, that Levi- nas condemns art.40 The problem that Levinas faces here is the fol- lowing: once you admit the relationship between the other's body and figuration (through beauty), and the resemblance between all images and the face,41 the Other seems to have ties with the visible that are too close and threatens to recede into the sphere of immanence. This is why, on the one hand, Levinas continues to denounce the work of art-but always in a problematic way-and, on the other hand, tries to shield ever more the face and body of the other from the risk of visibil- ity. It is this tension that we need to examine. It reveals two things: the impossibility of separating the image from the body (and the body from the image), and the necessity of not assimilating them, of not incorpo- rating them. The image is always, for Levinas, an image of the face ("the inanimate resembling the face" [AT, 123]), but it is also that from which the face must be saved. Levinas, in this sense, is not iconoclastic but iconomachic; it is for him less a matter of having a position than of thinking a tension, a tension that is none other than the power of im- ages to touch us. THE ATTEMPT TO SHIELD THE BODY FROM THE IMAGE Totality and Infinity finally abandons the face to its struggle with its own phenomenality. Henceforth, Levinas will seek to shield the Other 40. "In the 'prohibition against representation' I am only questioning the exclusive privilege that Western culture has conferred on consciousness [conscience] and science [science]" (AT, 125). 41. Thus: "Beneath the plasticity of the face [figure] that appears, the face [visage] is already missed. It is frozen in art itself, despite the artist's possible attempt to disfigure the 'something' that starts again, figurative, in presence" (AT, 126).</page><page sequence="21">120 Yale French Studies from the image, to break this robust, persistent link that ties the body to the image. We will analyze this development in four stages: 1. The face conceived as a pure existent, as a substance Ka0a'coro, and finally as a supreme existent, does not hide its resemblance to God himself. But the very term "resemblance" implies that the face some- how belongs, as much as God (the face of God), to visibility, to the world and its system of reciprocal relations. Against this risk-which Der- rida has pointed out42-Levinas intends to describe the face as a trace. After questioning himself ("Have we been faithful enough to the pro- hibition against seeking the beyond, as a world behind our world?" [CPP, 103]), he reveals the necessity of dissociating the face from any idea of the presentation of Infinity: "The signifyingness of the trace puts us into a 'lateral' relation that cannot be converted into rectitude (something inconceivable in the order of disclosure and being)" (CPP, 103). Thus, the face is no longer revelation, as in Totality and Infinity. Hence the first shielding from the image: "The God who has passed is not the model of which the face would be the image. To be in the im- age of God does not mean to be the icon of God, but to find oneself in his trace" (CPP, 106). 2. The ethical relation seemed to be produced in the present of a face-to-face. But the present of this "encounter" would presuppose a synchronization of Me and the Other, the existence of a time that would envelop us both and in which the face of the other wouldpresent itself. The image is presentation (or its modalities: representation, pre- sentification) and is given in the present: "The common hour marked by the clock is the hour in which the neighbor reveals himself and de- livers himself in his image, but it is precisely in his image that he is no longer near" (OB, 89). The trace is not the present sign of an absence, it refers to an absence that cannot be presented, that cannot therefore be recollected: it leads us toward a past that was never present, toward an immemoriality. The relation to the other is diachronic. This is the sec- ond shielding from the image. 3. All the while conceding the possibility of Eros as a perturbation of the face-to-face, Levinas maintained, in Totality and Infinity, the ir- reducible anteriority of the face and the possibility that an ethical re- lation could be free of any alteration. Eros was indeed "beyond the 42. In "Violence and Metaphysics," in Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), Derrida glosses Levinas's sentence: "The Other resembles God."</page><page sequence="22">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 121 face." Thus, if the Other was to break into the heart of the world, it could only be by giving itself over to a perception and not a sensation. It took place as something visible (even if undoing its visibility) and not as something tactile. A simple negation of the visible, the face was still available to the gaze. Otherwise than Being thinks epiphany as an ex- cess rather than a negation: "It is the superlative, more than the nega- tion of category, that interrupts the system" (OB, 187, n. 5). For this, we need an immediacy of the relation of Me to the Other that only the flesh provides. In this book, the face and the sexual organ are intimately im- bricated and bound together. If ethics maintains its primacy, it has nev- ertheless become impossible outside of the carnal relationship: "The- one-for-the-other, exposure of self to another, immediacy in the caress and in the contact of saying-the immediacy of a skin and a face, a skin that is always the modification of a face, of a face that is weighed down with a skin" (OB, 85).43 The implication has become reciprocal, and this change is crucial. Levinas will seek new concepts with which to char- acterize it. Thus, while Eros remains what it already was-an alteration of the epiphany of the face-the face is now conceived as always already "weighed down" by skin: this term, through its dynamic connotation, encourages us to think henceforth about the organic coexistence of the face and Eros (further reinforced by the promotion of the term "skin": how could a face be without skin?) as a crux of contrary forces. The face is no longer invisible because it would disintegrate as an image but because it is caressed or touched, because it abandons itself to a sensibility that does not turn into perception. The ethical relation, transcendence, and alterity can then only be established between bod- ies, redefined here as nodal unities of a face and a skin. It is precisely because the face is a body in this sense that it cannot be seen and that it escapes images, according to Levinas. My relation to the neighbor is undergone as an immediate contact, a "leap over images" (OB, 72). Hence the third disengagement, which implies that subjects are always already bodies or flesh-not even in bodies or in flesh. It is the corpo- reality of the subject that renders it sensible to the Other. Incarnation is pre-original.44 43. Many other formulations emphasize the "crux" [noeud] formed henceforth by the face and the "skin," their homogeneity and even their "unity" (OB, 89-90). 44. Incarnation-unintelligible because prior to consciousness (OB, 79)-is not the Christian incarnation of a double nature, the intromission of a Verb in a body, a visibil- ity of the invisible ("Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father," John 14:9). For Levi- nas, to be incarnated does not mean to be in the flesh, but of the flesh.</page><page sequence="23">122 Yale French Studies 4. Consequently, the Other is no longer given in the heart of a "re- lation," a concept stemming from formal logic and a rationality of con- sciousness. A body-to-body no longer restricted to Eros, ethics, or the one-for-the-other, is experienced as "proximity." The excess proper to all contact forbids its objectification in a term-to-term relation,45 and thereby forbids the emergence of any image: "The proximity of beings of flesh and blood is not their presence 'in the flesh [en chair en et os],' is not the fact that they take form for a gaze, presenting an exterior- quiddities, forms, offering images, which the eye absorbs" (OB, 78). This is the fourth escape. THE PERSISTENCE OF IMAGES The insistence with which Levinas underscores the separation be- tween the body and the image illustrates how much the latter chases the body ever further, like its shadow or double, how much the image resists. Now, only this separation justifies the consideration of ethics as first philosophy, and it alone enables us to distinguish the holy from the sacred. According to Levinas's distinction,46 images are sacred, they are not holy. They entertain one's curiosity for the divine, they cultivate the libido videndi and distract, whereas the truth of God is my neighbor. If the body were the producer of images, if the image were the continuation of the very movement whereby the body is made body-if figuration took root in a body where the gaze and the sexual organ were joined together-then this distinction between the holy and the sacred, between the truth of the religious and its staging [mise en scene], would be blurred.47 And yet, once again we would be tempted to attribute to figuration what Levinas says about the other's body. By showing how the image pursues the body, how it is ultimately its se- cretion, we will clarify the difference that exists between figuration and simple image-representation. Let us review point by point the path Le- vinas takes: 1. The notion of the trace that Levinas employs to save the face from representation, or sight [l'aspectl, paradoxically draws it even closer to 45. "Proximity does not congeal into a structure except when, represented in the de- mand for justice (which is reversible), it reverts to a simple relation" (OB, 82, emphasis added). 46.

(NTR, 146).</page><page sequence="24">PHILIPPE CRIGNON 123 figuration: figuration here is the image insofar as it is fabricated, urged to come, and traced, not insofar as it presents itself or represents. It is this urging (drive, compulsion) and this dynamic that are on the point of shattering form yet always retain it. With the trace, we leave the the- oretical model of the image-representation but only to adopt that of the drawing: "The trace is sketched out and effaced in the face" (OB, 12).48 A drawing is never complete, it refers to an absence that we cannot catch up to or "track down." We can always touch it up or make an- other go at it, but it opens onto an irretrievable absence. And yet it is, or rather it comes, presents itself as a passage, a route. 2. The diachronic relation to the face recalls, then, that a drawing is not the imprint of a past perception that once was present. The draw- ing, which is not opposed here to painting but to representation and is therefore identified with figuration itself, refers to a more distant past than anything that can be recollected,49 to an immemoriality, to the "past of the Other where eternity is delineated" (CPP, 106, emphasis added), as Levinas states with respect to the face. It is with the Chris- tian, pictorial term of "visitation" that Levinas describes the unex- pected arrival [survenuej of the face in the world, the entry of a time from before birth into the heart of recuperable time.50 3. The unity of a face and a sexual organ in a body, which enables proximity, puts into question the meaning of inversion, the term used in Totality and Infinity to denote the link and the distance established between the face and the erotic body, on the one hand, and Eros and the work of art, on the other. Now, if inversion is conceived of as a unity, the beautiful work, the work of art-an inversion of the "feminine," but also already an image-is joined to the body from which it issues: "Proximity also delineates the trope of lyricism: to love by telling one's love to the beloved-love songs, the possibility of poetry, of art" (OB, 199, n.10, emphasis added). Beauty-what touches and moves-is given to a sensibility or a vulnerability and not, in a representation, to consciousness. The work of art is thus not what I judge to be beautiful 48. Or again: "It is this situation at first purely dialectical and quasi-verbal ... that the exceptional signifyingness of the trace delineates [dessine] in the world" (CPP, 106, emphasis added). 49. "Painting opens onto itself, which opens onto the immemorial: the presence al- ways- already and always- still there, inexhaustibly withdrawn in itself, tirelessly ex- posed before us" (Jean-Luc Nancy, Visitation (de la peinture chretienne) [Paris: Galilee, 2001], 42). 50. See Nancy, Visitation, 52, where this expression of Levinas's is glossed in direct relation to its pictorial and Christian sense.</page><page sequence="25">124 Yale French Studies (as in Kant) nor what can become the object of an experience (as in Husserlian phenomenology), but "what comes near" because it comes from afar. "What comes near" is at once what must be approached and what approaches me. 4. With "proximity," Levinas can show that from Me to the Other there is not a relation between two terms, but a contact: the contact of "Saying," that is, a contact with the face itself, a contact that in its def- inition does not imply any contiguity. Consequently, I do not see the Other if to see is to perceive. But since the contact at issue here is not that of a hand against skin but that which is produced between his face and my eye, contact is also sustained within the heart of the gaze. In the end, only perception is excluded from vision, but not the touching of two vulnerabilities stripped of their form: "One can see and hear as one touches" (OB, 191, n. 9). It is with this type of vision that I see the face, and it is through it that contact becomes alterity: "In every vision contact is announced: sight and hearing caress the visible and the au- dible. Contact is not an openness upon being, but an exposure to being" (OB, 80). What gives itself to be seen is not exhausted in representation: as trace, drawing, figuration, it addresses itself to a sensibility and a sus- ceptibility. FIGURATION Levinas insists on excluding the image, and the image resists in the form of figuration. While he claims to suppress the image, Levinas frees himself only from representation. Why, then, does he continue to talk about images? To preserve the possibility of a holiness that would not "be confused with the sacred and turn into sorcery," the possibility of a formlessness that would not be tempted to re-form itself. But this pos- sibility is never established: the image is continually reborn of the body like the head of a monster, of a monstrum. It remains an ambiguity, that of the intact, the pure, the non-contaminated.51 Figuration is the nec- 51. Derrida has noted the unity of the holy and the sacred, while also remarking upon the perhaps necessary attempt to distinguish between them: "We will have to devote all our attention to this series, taking as our point of departure this last word (heilig), this German word whose semantic history seems however to resist the rigorous dissociation that Levinas wishes to maintain between a natural, 'pagan,' even Graeco-Christian sa- credness, and the holiness of (Jewish) law, before or under Roman religion" ("Faith and Knowledge: The Two Sources of 'Religion' at the Limits of Reason Alone," trans.

What body are we talking about? A body is never alone: humanity begins with two, in a body-to- body52-the face-to-face and the caress-from which the image as fig- ure is born. Figuration finds its necessity here. Or, to put it differently, there is no ethical/erotic experience that does not initiate a movement toward figuration, be it the weakest or most banal of inclinations. Fac- tual contingencies complicate these questions of degree. But art is al- ready announced in the relation to the Other by virtue of a compulsion to figure. With this term, I wish to stress at once the role of drives in artistic activity and the ontological constraint that sustains this activ- ity. The ethical and erotic origin of figuration does not imply that there are two distinct sources that would add up or be mutually articulated, nor that on an injunction from the Other a psychological motivation would be superimposed. The source of the work of art is one, but dou- ble, the drive being already-unlike an instinct-turned toward al- terity. The propensity to figure is therefore at once-but without schism-ethical and erotic: desire and obedience. Against this compulsion to figure we could easily object that, by lack of either talent or desire, not all people devote themselves to fig- ural activity. Even if this were true, however, nothing here would be put into question: the image comes wherever there is a body develop- ing itself: in children, for instance, where we would undoubtedly find few exceptions. But also on a supra-individual level: when the individ- ual enters a new body, the social body, he or she can delegate this com- pulsion-to artists, to churches, to technicians. It is, then, in this com- munity that the necessity of figuration is manifest: there is no social body that has not compulsively produced images, any more than there is a child who has not extended lived alterity by figuring it. -Translated by Nicole Simek and Zahi Zalloua 52.
