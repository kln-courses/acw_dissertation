<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM JOHN LAIRD UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN THEISTS, I suppose, are persons who believe in "God's" exis- tence. Atheists are persons who deny the same. Such statements may be suitable, and even adequate, for many proper purposes. In several contexts it is silly or mali- cious to interrogate them closely. Even in theology, which is, or should be, some kind of science, they may have, and they do have, their use and their propriety. For many theological pur- poses, however (and also for some others) they are far too vague. It may be wrong, no doubt, to tell a theologian that he must either produce an accurate definition of what he means by "God" or be forever shamed. His contention may be that deity is incomprehensible in detail and very nearly or alto- gether incomprehensible in principle. He may also say that definitions are demod6 in good new-fashioned science. On the other hand he should not be able to afford to be recklessly vague. He ought to give an intelligible account of what he would be at when he calls himself a theist, or, at any rate, a clear account of what "God" is not. As it seems to me, contemporary theologians are apt to be rather insensitive to this requirement. One of the commonest events in their world is to find that once an argument about theism has got under way (for there is usually greater tranquil- lity in the beginnings of it) they loudly protest "0, but you're not talking about theism at all." Their meaning seems to be that you are contemplating something rather different from Christian monotheism. If you begin to ask whether Aristotle, or Sankara or certain of the Sufis were not theists after all, they begin to murmur Non per dialecticam, forgetting that if it did not please the deity to give his people salvation by dialectics it did please him to give them theology in precisely that way. In short, a pretty careful scrutiny of critical terms is fre- quently essential. Let us take smallish things first. Monotheism is an accurate</page><page sequence="2">64 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and convenient term for expressing the belief that there is but one God. Why then deny that polytheism is also a form of theism? It is irrelevant to say that polytheism is too crude a form of theism to be taken seriously; but if the statement were relevant, what would follow? Monotheism may also be crude, and cer- tain forms of crude polytheism seem to have been more sophis- ticated than a vague acceptance of a numinous mana which, nevertheless, was one rather than many (or may have been). Apart from that, why assume that polytheism is crude or care- less or both? The Olympic Gods, or the gods of the nether world, or of various shifting henotheisms may have been rela- tively crude, and a high degree of unity and integration may be an essential mark of any developed form of theism. A so- ciety, however, may be very highly integrated. To hold with some Indian philosophers that if there were many Gods they must disagree is not a view that looks at all like an inescapable metaphysical verity. What is crude about the suggestion that deity may be the name for a society of powerful and gentle spirits in communion and unison with one another? The Gods might be in full accord and not be a huddle of divisive entities like a celestial League of Nations. Again, if God were a single being, what metaphysical or other guarantee would we have that he was in unison with himself either at one time or at all times? It is a great pity, I think, if metaphysical pluralists who deny the supremacy of any single ultimate entity but as- cribe what would commonly be called divine properties to the society of ultimate reals in which they believe should be called and should call themselves atheists 1 on the ground that the current Western associations of the word "theism" are almost always monotheistic in some rather special sense. Here it is better to be a verbalist and point out that polytheism is non- sense unless it is a form of theism. A more interesting point concerns pantheism. I am not now discussing the merits of pantheism, although if it is held (as many Christian theists do hold) that God is all, that there is nothing outside him, it is hard to see how "panthe- ism" can be discarded in all its forms. Again, I am not much I As McTaggart did.</page><page sequence="3">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 65 interested in the relations between pantheism and mono- or polytheism. Distributive pantheism (i.e. the doctrine that whatever is, is either a God or a godling) would seem to be the most extreme form of polytheism that there was (at any rate until we began to ask what the ultimate constituents of reality were). Totalitarian pantheism (which is not logically incon- sistent with the distributive variety) is usually regarded as a species of philosophical monism. But let us by-pass all that. When it is said (and this is a common saying) that pantheism, content to remain such, is not theism, the meaning must be that "theism" is narrower than pantheism, and requires a further differentiating characteristic. This seems to me to be a very inconvenient way of arguing. What is the point of taking pantheism seriously unless it is what most of its friends believe it to be, a perfectly genuine form of theism? Convenience, however, may be a relatively small matter. What is important is that essential differences should be clearly expressed and not allowed to take cover in the mists. In the main what pantheism is said to lack is the due recog- nition that deity is supramundane. Theism proper, we are told, makes no such mistake. This seems hard on the pantheists. Strictly, if God be all, this "all" must include whatever is supramundane. In short the criticism amounts to saying that pantheism should be under- stood to be the doctrine that God is immanent in the world (the mundus, of course, and not simply the orbis terrarum) and does not transcend the "world" in any relevant sense. In effect, therefore, we are asked to say that theism is always in some sense supernatural and that there is no pantheism except nature-pantheism. As I have said, pantheists may reasonably complain of this attempt to impoverish their resources by definition. Not all of them need be Nature-worshippers in most of the current senses of "Nature." At the very least a clear indication should be given of the respects in which the divine immanence asserted in pantheism falls short of the transcendence that "genuine" theism is said to require.</page><page sequence="4">66 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Let us consider some of the principal senses in which divine transcendence (i.e. transcendence of "the world" or of "na- ture") may be asserted. (1) The plainest doctrine (usually said to be rather crude) is simply that God is a being distinct from all the beings in the world and from the world itself. He need not be "above the bright blue sky," we are told, but may be spaceless (or wrap himself in a space of his own); and being eternal or timeless he is beyond all that is temporal. This view is even more mysterious regarding time than re- garding space, but it seems to be straightforward and it is con- sistent with many sub-varieties e.g. with the view that the world is just an isolated episode God-produced and later God- annihilated, or with the Eastern view that there is a succession of world-cycles divinely set agoing and anon divinely stopped "in order that sometimes there may be peace." (2) A very different view would be that "Nature" is a name for all that there is (all that is finite and infinitude too) but that it connotes a certain set of properties only, and so that it is guilty of very flagrant sins of omission if it is taken to be afull indication of the properties of existence. According to this view the thing is as if one were content to describe a nation by elementary census statistics, or a man by reference to his weight alone paying no attention to his complexion, tastes or morals. In this case there would be no supramundane existent or existents but there might well be extensive supernatural properties in all that falls within the purview of natural knowl- edge; and it would be possible that the supernatural properties of the natural-propertied might be integrated in such a way as to make the language of the most majestic monotheism defensi- ble and even intelligible. (3) If it were held that to neglect anything is necessarily to muddle everything a consequence of the above view (i.e. of (2) supra) would be that "Nature" must falsify by omission, and so is the name for a radical misconception of reality, well- grounded in certain senses but eventually false. So far as I can see, however, this alleged consequence is itself ill-drawn and confounds between a risk and a certainty. Abstraction, though</page><page sequence="5">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 67 hazardous, need not falsify. So we must distinguish between the natural omissions of the above (i.e. of (2) supra) and the view now to be considered viz. that nature is the name for a systematic misconception of the real (perhaps well-grounded, and so not merely illusory). This misconception, it may be said, is occasioned, perhaps excused, and perhaps (in certain ways) rendered inevitable by the piecemeal and helter-skelter char- acter of our sensations combined with the fact that our evidence for existence is derived from sensations and that we have to construe these as best we may (which is not very well) by a species of rule of guess. In this case the distinction between the mundane and the supramundane would be epistemological and not ontological. There would be no contrast between a "world" and an "over- world." There would not even be a contrast between the "over- worldly" and the "this-worldly" properties of anything that had this-worldly properties in a sense not ultimately erroneous. The contrast would be between systematic misconception, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, an order of conceptions that was true. (4) Another view that prevails in some philosophies and in many theologies is that "Nature" (as a whole if it is one) and all natural things have some sort of imperfection in their "mode of being." This imperfection is described in many various ways. "Nature," it is said, is a mixture of being and non-being. It exists but isn't "real." It has being but only "creaturely" or "created" or "dependent" being. It contains a moment of "negativity" which is "unreality" and "non-being." It exists but is not self-existent. It exists but is not self-explanatory. And so on as fancy dictates. Despite august authority I submit that these views are en- tirely without substance being based upon an elementary mis- take. They confuse epistemology with ontology and assume that if you partly apprehend and partly misapprehend X you have to believe that there are at least two X's viz. X-in-part- apprehended and X-in-part-misapprehended. They also hold that you can go on to say that one at least of these has some sort of "partial being." And that is fantasy.</page><page sequence="6">68 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW In general it may be true that when we say "This exists" we are usually understood to mean "This is a physical body." In the fundamental sense, however, to say "This exists" (whether "this" be finite or infinite) is just to say "There is this" what- ever "this" may be. That is a simple and a final statement (whether or not it is hard to establish). It is quite wrong to say that anything "exists more" than anything else. There may be more of it. It may be stronger and tougher and so forth. But if it exists it just exists, weak or strong, enduring or transient. "Creaturely things" if they exist at all, do really exist and cannot half-exist. The same would be true of the other state- ments made above about "negativity" "non-self-explanatori- ness" and the like although in detail each particular way of de- scribing this alleged distinction would require a special slant in the appropriate answer to it. As regards pantheism, which was the occasion for this ex- cursus, it seems clear that while all or most pantheists would and should reject the first of these types of supramundane theism, most of them need not reject either the second or the third. Spinoza, for instance (who is commonly reputed a prince among pantheists) may be cited as an adherent of the second (if one supposes that his "third grade of knowledge" was not intended to upset his "second grade") or of the third (if one takes "natu- ral knowledge" to be incurably temporal). As to the fourth view, I think it should be rejected by everyone out of hand. If, however, the question be not what should be held but what has been held, it is clear that the fourth view is united in many philosophies with some sort of philosophical monism, and that there are very strong grounds for supposing that philosophical monism, if it has any theistic color at all, is liker (totalitarian) pantheism than any other shade of theism. Up to the present I have been discussing the way in which various theories which have a verbal (and, I should say, very often much more than a merely verbal) claim to be accounted forms of theism are assumed not to be forms of theism in many quarters on many occasions. The assumption seems to be that nothing is theism which does not closely resemble Christian theism.</page><page sequence="7">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 69 Hence I think there is occasion for misgivings. There are few who would say outright that theism means Christian theism, that and that alone. Instead they prefer to use the word (and freely censure others for not using it) in a sense which is not too sharply in contrast with the penumbra of association that usually clings to the theism of Christian dogma. This course (while adopted, no doubt in all candor) has grave disadvan- tages. It is loose where it should be stringent and avoids cardinal issues, in particular the question whether it is quite clear that "Christian theism" is just one thing with a firm central thesis as well as the equally important question whether certain of the discredited theories (e.g. certain forms of panthe- ism) may not resemble much "Christian theism" in most of their essentials a good deal more closely than many forms of "theism" that do not come under the ban. If it is the associative penumbra of "Christian theism" that governs the proper use of the term "theism" in theological arguments, we should have to say much more than that theism must be in some sense monotheistic and also supramundane. For mere deism would be these. God, we should have to say, must be wise and also righteous although his wisdom may be very unlike the wisdom of men (which may be only sagacious foolishness) and although his righteousness may not be at all similar to the righteousness of scribes and Pharisees, Greek philosophers and canonical jurists. Tenderness, compassion, and a discriminating lovingkindness for mankind would also be included, and that would be part of the insistence (more vocifer- ous to-day and, I think, rather less careful than it used to be) upon the essential connection between "theism" and the belief in a "personal" God. Some indeed would seem to go so far as to say that the very notion of an impersonal (which need not be a sub-personal) deity is self-contradictory. It is admitted that the personality in God as well as the personality of God is a very knotty point in Christian divinity, but, at the very least (we are informed) God must be personal in the sense that the sort of spiritual integration which empirically is seen at its best in a wise and saintly man is mutatis mutandis (and great are the mutanda) a fundamental character in the divine being.</page><page sequence="8">70 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW This preamble, nominally at least, has been about the term "theism," its meaning, its use and its associative penumbrae in Western theology. Nothing has, so far, been said explicitly about hypertheism and its relation to theism. By hypertheism I mean the doctrine that the evidence which leads to God also leads beyond him. That is often said. Accord- ing to Eckhart, Godhead was above God and beyond him. Ac- cording to many neo-Platonists The One is above and beyond each and every divine henad. According to Sankara and other Indian philosophers Ishvara is only a God and so is below the ultimate Brahman, the non-dual ultimate of the Vedanta. Ac- cording to many philosophical monists God is below the Ab- solute. Clearly, there is little point in discussing the relations be- tween theism and hypertheism unless theism is interpreted with some precision. If any philosophy with a Godward tendency, no matter where, is to be accounted theism, hypertheism is not opposed to such a theism or contrasted with it. If any philoso- phy which finds a place for God is "theism" there is no proper contrast between theism and hypertheism. In this vague way it is quite common to find mystical and super-intellectual hy- pertheisms accounted forms of theism even when the exponents of such theories protest (as Sankara and Bradley did). As I have said, arguments which are quite sufficiently precise for the purposes of certain contexts are not nearly precise enough for others. As it seems to me the contrast between theism and hypertheism cannot afford to be vague. If you must go beyond God you have no business to speak as if you were content to stop short with God, even if it be less mislead- ing to say you are a theist than to say you are an atheist. It is difficult to take theism seriously unless it professes to give an ultimate explanation of the nature of things. When we say "God knoweth" we mean to say something final. What is said to be "in God's hands" is presumed not to be in any higher hands. And so forth. If theism makes any lesser claims it is only a sham. Consider, for instance, Samuel Alexander's "theism." God, according to this philosophy, is the next stage above mind in the</page><page sequence="9">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 71 up-and-up nisus with which space-time is perpetually in labor. There is not the slightest reason for supposing that God is the last stage in this emergent process. Indeed there is every reason (if there is any reason) for supposing the contrary. Smith's dog worships Smith, and Smith worships his God, and Smith's God worships a being that is higher still. In short what is properly worshipful is just the up-and-up tendency itself. There is no point in worshipping a mere stage in a process. For any clear-headed Smith the truth would be, not "Blessed be God" but "Blessed be the nisus." Consider some other imaginative flights. To worship God as creator may be a most fitting devotion if part of the meaning of creation be that Nature and man have their sole source in the uncreated deity. But it would be almost puerile to worship the creator of the world if this world-creator were only an underling or demiurge, or, in the extreme, to worship the Devil if, as some have thought, this demiurge was really the Devil. The same would be true if, as has been imagined in the East, the world sprang from a golden egg that Brahman set upon chaos. It would be Brahman, not Ishvara, that was the genuine object of pious devotion. Something similar might be said (although, in many ways, something that is also dissimilar) if the word " Gods" is not taken to describe what is ultimate but as a figurative, symbolic and imaginative way of describing the ultimate properties of ex- istence in terms that are suited to the presumed capacity of the hearer. Such a view, of course, is very familiar and there are few theologians who would not admit that many of the ways in which God is partially described are tinged or even suffused with an anthropomorphism, a zoomorphism, an anemomor- phism, an astromorphism or a pyromorphism that could not be defended literally. In a sense such a view is hypertheistic. It believes that the ultimates of existence are "beyond " the pulpit pictures of "God." In another sense, however, it is not hyper- theistic; for all it is saying in the end is that God, who is the ultimate, is commonly described in language that cannot be taken literally but conveys its meaning with the grace and, it may be, with the profundity of poetry, legend and imaginative</page><page sequence="10">72 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW symbolism. If it were held that the human mind, principia quaerens, is bound to go through this imaginative symbolic phase before its thought can reach a higher (and, indeed, the last) phase the consequence would be that our minds are driven beyond theism by the very impulse that first impels them to theism. That is what I mean by hypertheism in its most important sense. If however (and this is the commoner view) symbol, figure and imagination are only alternatives to other ways of describing the divine being, not stages in a single itinerary of devout spiritual search, "hypertheism" would seem to be a misnomer. Disputes (if there were any) between theists and hypertheists would tend to degenerate into wrangles about the legitimacy of accounting the intellect "higher" than poetry, symbol or legend (if it is the intellect that is supposed to go beyond theism) or of accepting some peculiar mystical power to reach what is "higher" (if such a power is supposed to be superior to the figurative and symbolic language in which "God" is so often described). In any case this particular con- trast between theism and hypertheism is acontrast in ways of representing deity and not a contrast between the belief that God is supreme, on the one hand, and, on the other, the belief that he is but an Ishvara who is Brahman's lieutenant and creature. Obviously an apologist for Christian theism has a more exact- ing brief than theists of a more general cast. He is entitled, of course, to admit that much that is said about God in the Bible and in other Christian literature is but figurative, or adapted to ears sometimes rude and almost always unscientific. Nevertheless there are limits to the elasticity of his views on such matters. Let him de-anthropomorphize the God of the Bible (supposing that the biblical accounts tally). He cannot completely veil the countenance of one that pitied men. He must admit some sort of providential arrangement, and a righteousness that has some effective resemblance to what men account righteousness in their mannish affairs. He is bound to believe in a God whose incarnation in Christ is not wholly in- conceivable, and to accept a certain historicity in God's deal- ings with mankind, asserting that "what actually happened"</page><page sequence="11">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 73 was not only an expression of deity - for anything in the world might be that - but also was something that in some special and almost straightforward sense was divine in a way in which no other historical events ever have been or ever could be. Therefore it is surely essential to consider whether or not the various theistic proofs favor Christian theism; and if any of them favor hypertheism and are an embarrassment to Christian theists it is only candid to say so. Let us briefly examine the most familiar of the traditional proofs, omitting the argument from motion which may fairly be called pre-scientific. The Argument from Design - or more strictly, the Argu- ment to a Designer - professes to show that the world, being a product, implies a producer, and may go on to argue that this producer must be a providence solicitous for mankind. The goodness or badness of this argument is not our present concern. We are now asking what sort of deity would thus be proved if the proof held. The answer would be that what was proved was the existence of a supramundane deity, in a per- fectly definite sense of "supramundane," who either produced the world ex nihilo, or by emanation from himself, or manipu- lated the contents of a co-eternal "receptacle" much in the way in which a potter manipulates and masters clay. Such a deity might not be ultimate; but he might be; and, if he were, there would be no difficulty in using the language of Christian theism, or, for that matter, of pulpit theism, in a straight- forward way. Indeed there would be great difficulty in using it in any other way. You would have said too much to be able to afford to have any traffic with hypertheism. You would be working with and accepting familiar human notions about planning, succoring, fashioning and contriving and would be applying them directly to the world instead of applying them to vases or bookshelves or other artifacts. Consider next the Cosmological Argument. This, as I sup- pose, is an argument from the self-insufficiency of the world to a complement which (it is held) must be divine. The Argument from Design may be consistent with the Cosmological, and, indeed, may be a special form of it; but</page><page sequence="12">74 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW only on certain assumptions. If these assumptions are aban- doned there may be downright inconsistency. If the world were a product, a mere created thing, a thing that would dissolve at once if it were not perpetually sustained, conserved and refreshed by deity, that (on certain assumptions) would of itself be a proof of the world's self-insufficiency, and the required complement would be (or at least might be) just its producer and conserver. The alleged self-insufficiency of the world, however, might be of quite another order. For in- stance the meaning might be that the world was a misconcep- tion, or a partial description, false when taken to be complete; or the like. If so, the required complement could not possibly be a producer in any intelligible sense of that term, and would not be supramundane in any straightforward sense. In par- ticular if the Cosmological Argument were so interpreted as to require the Ontological it would be definitely inconsistent with the Argument from Design, understood as something final, that is, as theistic. Roughly speaking, this contention is as follows: the world is said to be self-insufficient because it is not self-explanatory (whatever that may mean). Therefore a complement is re- quired if existence is self-explanatory. The business of the Ontological Argument is just to show a priori that existence must be self-explanatory. If so the brunt of the debate would fall upon the Ontological Argument; but let us pause for comment. What is being said is that reality must be self-sufficient and that the world is not self-sufficient. If so, it is logically possible that its complement is also self-insufficient. If, as some phi- losophers say, God needs the world as much as (or at any rate as truly as) the world needs him, if God would be frustrated unless he "proceeded" to the world, the plain consequence would be that both God and the world would be severally self- insufficient, although together they would (or might) be self- sufficient. In that case several possible theories would be defensible most of which (for sound apologetic reasons) are commonly rejected by Christian theists.</page><page sequence="13">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 75 The Ontological Argument is usually stated pretty vaguely nowadays though its partisans always explain that it is very profound. That the One or the Infinite properly speaking alone is given, not the many or the finite; that the core of mind or thought or spirit is also the core of reality. These and similar statements usually supplant what in Anselm's hands or Des- cartes's was taken to be a strict piece of formal demonstration. But whatever its precise form may be (or for that matter, whatever its imprecise fructifying impressionism) it seems clear that all expressions of the argument attempt to establish some kind of philosophical monism. And philosophical monism, if it is theistic at all, is hypertheistic and is not theism. In particu- lar it is inconsistent in spirit and in statement with supra- mundane transcendence in any straightforward sense, with providential contrivance, with any and every historical incar- nation which is less than completely cosmic. Absolutists, like Bradley, saw this clearly and said so. The same would be true of Parmenides or of Sankara's Advaita Vedanta. Whatever sympathy we may have with theologians who ex- plain that complete intellectual clarity is not to be expected in matters which must very largely be incomprehensible, we can- not have the same sympathy with a very usual tendency, namely the tendency to affirm with some complacency that theists have at their disposal a large number of arguments all of which favor theism and converge towards it so that the cumu- lative effect of them all is very encouraging indeed. At the risk of appearing harsh and captious and "ununderstanding" it seems necessary to point out that if the "God" who is proved or suggested by some of these arguments is inconsistent with the "God" who is proved or suggested by others the alleged consilience is not at all encouraging. Again, if only a few of these arguments, and these not the best, are reconcilable with the simpler interpretations of the Bible story, that also is not very encouraging for Christian theists. No doubt it may plausibly be maintained that these tradi- tional arguments are vieux jeu in contemporary Christian theology. That, however, should not mean that they may all be abandoned without a tear. They are always turning up,</page><page sequence="14">76 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW although usually in a looser form; and looseness may be more comfortable than impressive. Supposing, then, that they have some importance in some forms, it is surely permissible to con- sider whether (a) they tend towards the same conclusion and (b) are so much as colorably consistent. Let us turn, however, to certain theological ways of arguing, to methods rather than to proofs. Those I shall consider are certainly not new (which is scarcely a disadvantage) but are often held, in these present days, to be impervious to antiqua- tion in a way the traditional "proofs" were not. We are told that they have ripeness without caducity. Consider, for instance, the via analogica in theology. In certain ways there is no denying that many theological statements can at best be analogical. If time originates in eternity it cannot originate in the ordinary sense (which is temporal). If creation has occurred, its modus operandi is either a complete mystery or is very vaguely analogous to any sort of empirical productivity. If the unconditioned conditions, it cannot condition in the way in which Pavlov conditioned his dogs. Nevertheless, unless the via analogica is just a licence for pious vagueness it is bound to sketch the general lines on which the analogy does hold and to contrast the operative part of the analogy with the respects in which there can be nothing but mystery. Thus if you say that God created the world you are saying something which cannot be wholly indefinite. You don't know how it was done. Experience gives no definite clues (even if poets and painters allege the contrary). In these and in many other ways your analogical language may be very vague in- deed. On the other hand you are professing to be able to dis- tinguish between creation, on the one hand, and, on the other, emanation or the remodelling of a pre-existent Vbrobox~i. You assert that the world is wholly dependent on God while he does not depend upon it in any way. In short the very meaning of your language is that the analogy is quite precise in certain specifiable respects. Similarly, statements to the effect that God's care for men</page><page sequence="15">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 77 and women is special and individually discriminating is a defi- nite statement even if his love and pity differ enormously and incomprehensibly from the way in which a father pitieth his children. In such respects the belief in a Providence is either definite or meaningless. Consider again the Incarnation. However incomprehensible this major mystery may be in many of its aspects there is much in it which is definite and quite unscreened from analogical enigmas. For Christian theists Christ and no one else was in- carnated to be the God-man. That is quite different from divinity being made flesh in a race, or in a sacred bull, or in the Eastern theory according to which some Krishna invariably arose when human affairs were desperately in need of such a being. In short you cannot sidetrack all such statements all the time, crying "'Tis but an analogy honest man"; and if you are a hypertheist and not a theist you have to discard the state- ments altogether. You may legitimately say "There is a non- reciprocating dependence of the world on God which may be figuratively described by the language of creation and is then less misleading than in any other figure"; but you have also to say that there was no creation in any sense of creation that has a definite meaning. Your figurative language may sometimes be useful and not merely pardonable; but it is definitely mis- leading if its esoteric sense is not clearly indicated. Therefore, I submit that it should be abandoned altogether in serious theology. A philosophical monist cannot consistently be a Christian theist although he may be a hypertheist and might perhaps be a pantheist. Clearly his views are not conciliable with incarnation, creation, providence and similar conceptions in any candid sense of language. To defend his theism a Christian theist must set about to deny philosophical monism; and he is a wiser as well as a better man if he faces that issue squarely. The same sort of comment is even more obviously apposite in the case of the via negativa. That is a doctrine which has as good as no meaning except in the service of hypertheism and indeed of hypermonism. Its apex is reached when even unity</page><page sequence="16">78 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is denied to the One on the ground that a certain negative viz. "neither plural nor singular" is more accurate still. (It is not every negative that has this profundity but only a few negatives driven into the appropriate pen by the cunningest, and very positive, sheep-dogs.) Clearly, however, the belief that the world was produced, that there are providential arrangements, that there was an Incarnation and the like are positive and not negative statements. To deny them in any sense at all is to deny Christian and any ultimate theism whether or not the alternative of hypertheism remains. The last point on which I should like to touch (and I do so with great diffidence) is the testimony of "religious experience." If awe, reverence, piety and some sort of worship wherever the "numinous" is encountered is to be accounted "religious experience" the net is cast so widely and shimmers so elusively that the catch cannot be counted with any pretence at accuracy. In particular it would be quite useless to speculate upon the question whether the "numinous" resembles hypertheism or theism the more. Similarly it is not at all likely that experience of the numinous, in the general sense that Otto gave to that term, would have anything intelligible to say about Christian versus other forms of "theism," about the disqualification of polytheism or "mere" pantheism, about supramundane rather than immanent divinity, and the like. Indeed a reverent atheist, for instance a Buddhist, need have no occasion to deny the numinous. Again if it be said that it is unfair to make a fuss about the most primitive forms of experience of the numinous, and that candor requires us to examine not the mere spores of the numi- nous but its seedlings and mature plants, it is not at all clear that the more developed forms of the numinous carry us much beyond what some have called natural piety. It is very com- mon for Christians - although, I daresay they are very pedes- trian Christians - to say that they feel "the presence" at a sunset touch, or on a starry night or in a radiant dawn. They may mean more than nature-worship. Indeed with their train- ing it is unlikely that the celestial light they take to be inter- fused with and transfiguring the tints of common day has</page><page sequence="17">THEISM AND HYPERTHEISM 79 nothing of Calvary about it. On the other hand Nature- pantheists, who are only and strictly Nature-pantheists, are surely entitled to say that they do experience awe, reverence, wonder and mystery for Nature herself, that they also are among the mystics and are not mere wand-bearers; and the like. It is simply not true that a mystic must be either a supra- mundane theist or a hypertheist; and it is not at all clear that he must be a theist of any intelligible sort. If I am not very sadly mistaken, those theologians who rely largely or chiefly upon "religious experience" for the founda- tion of their theology are rather sharply divided according as they do or do not believe that there is what Hartley, not un- fairly, called a "theopathic sense." The former party says that although some men (how many?) may be God-blind or God- deaf the others are quite definitely God-sensitive. They may misinterpret the testimony of their theopathic sense or allow it to become blunted, starved, atrophied or corrupted (perhaps by evil living). But they do have it. The latter party declares that there is no such peculiar sensitivity but that the total im- pact of candid experience, allowing for its finer tendrils as well as for its crasser shoots, is Godward, and that any man's denial of the fact is due to his own obtuseness. Atheists, on this view, are not sense-defectives like the blind or the deaf faithfully re- porting their mutilated experience (if they are faithful). Being whole of faculty, they misreport their own religious experience. If the second party are in the right (as I hope they are) it is very doubtful whether "religious experience" could have much that was definite to say about the sort of theological questions that have been the subject of this essay. True, it would be reasonable and perhaps necessary to maintain that the "proofs" and the "methods" with which we have principally been con- cerned are subordinate to something wider, more imponderable, more impressionist, more totalitarian, and that an admitted subordination of this order may make a vital difference to one's conclusions. The so-called proofs and methods (we may be told) are rather clarifications of a conviction based upon the total impact of our experience than the premises on which the conviction is based or the actual method by which it was</page><page sequence="18">80 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW initially formed. Even so, however, the distinction between theism and hypertheism, or the inadequacy of "mere" panthe- ism, is just the point where clarification comes in. So it seems unlikely that "religious experience" could settle the point of clarity. No doubt it might be said that the total impact of "religious experience" signalled its warning against the suffi- ciency of "mere" pantheism or of some other effort of theologi- cal dialectic. By the same argument, however, all attempts at clarification are likely to be accompanied by a vague uneasiness and suspicion that something is lacking. If so hypertheism (if more than an utterly vague aspiration) would also come under the ban. ("Neti neti" and the "divine waste of the Godhead" may not seem to be altogether nourishing.) In short our special questions are not likely to find an answer on these lines. If, on the other hand, it is the theopathists who are right in what they say about "religious experience" there would be a chance at least that our theopathy testifies to some pretty definite form of theism. The chance, no doubt may be rather slender. It is difficult to see how creation, for instance, could be based on theopathic evidence, even allowing that a doctrine of creaturely being may seem to be a slightly plausible quasi- intellectual reconstruction of a specific theopathic impression of utter dependence. Still, in general, it must be granted that our specific theopathic sense, if there were such a thing, might en- able us to decide between theism and hypertheism, or, again, between a theism that was almost Christian and a theism or hemitheism of a different order. Among certain contemporary theologians the claim seems to be that our "religious experience" is a matter of "I and Thou," in other words that we touch and commune with a divine being whom we sense and know and feel to be not only our succor but also our friend. Indeed we are sometimes told (surely incau- tiously) that "religious experience" is just the response that the risen and continuing Christ makes to the devout. Of course it is very easy to see how a person brought up in the Christian tradition should, very naturally, put this interpreta- tion upon his religious experience. What is much harder to be- lieve is that he is giving an account of all genuine religious</page><page sequence="19">THEISM AND HYPERTHElSM 81 experience. Is it really credible that devout atheists, and pious men in the East who reject Christianity although they have studied it, and all the saints who lived more than two thousand years ago have had this sort of communion with Christ although they did not know it or expressly denied it? And if that were credible (and I suppose many Christians do actively believe it) is it also credible that "religious experience," wherever it oc- curs, has to be described in these terms and in these alone if it is faithfully and clearly set down? Suppose, however, that "religious experience," in any devel- oped form, is always an "I and Thou" experience. What in that case could we learn about the relation between theism and hypertheism or any similar question in theological science? So far as I can see, very little indeed. Religious men and women, according to this description of their religious experi- ence, would be touched by and have communion with a divine being, vastly greater and stronger than they, their rock and their shield, rich in compassion, warm in understanding. How from such an experience could it legitimately be inferred that this succoring and compassionate being was Brahman and not a mere Ishvara, was supramundane, was the creator of the world, was the One and not one of many, and the like? State- ments such as these (in a word, most of the bigger theological statements) would immensely extend any possible description of the "I and Thou" situation unless, of course the divine part- ner in this communion told the human partners that it was so. If he did, theology has no room for anything except revelation.</page></plain_text>
