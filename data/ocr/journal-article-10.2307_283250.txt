Attempts to explain the contradictions and inconsistencies of the Homeric pantheon have been unsuccessful, partly because they start from a priori assumption, partly from a failure to appreciate the extreme com- plexity of the poet's concepts. The gods are always present to his mind in all of their manifold aspects, and all of these aspects must be taken into account, not singly but collectively, in interpreting any particular passage. We must explore all possibilities without insisting upon one or another to the exclusion of the rest. The Protean qualities of Homer's gods have been a joy and a bewilderment to generations of hearers and readers, and all too often a scandal. For it must be confessed that ludicrous or unseemly performances of the immortals make up a very considerable portion of the narrative, especially in the Iliad. If we ask why the gods are so depicted, we confront one of the unsolved puzzles of Homeric study. It is true, as critics have observed, that the poet uses his Olympians for comic effects; he permits them to indulge in ridiculous behavior that would not be tolerated in the epic hero or heroine.' Yet this leaves much unexplained. The scandalous tale of Ares and Aphro- dite, for example, ends on a note of serene beauty and dignity; in three lines we pass from a scene that might have shocked the goodwife of Bath to the august serenity of the most sacred shrine of earth's most potent goddess (6 360-362). That majestic Zeus whose nod shakes great Olympus, the Zeus of Phidias and of all poets, is also the furtive, henpecked hus- band, made querulous by the thought of Hera's nagging, who presently finds relief in a ridiculous squabble with his consort ' Cf.

Calhoun [1937 (A 528-567). In the Theomachy is this same curious inter- mingling of the sublime with the ridiculous and vulgar, lines that are stigmatized as unspeakably bad by Leaf and Wila- mowitz and lines that can be acclaimed for their sublimity by so critical a spirit as Edward Gibbon.2 In the lay of Aphrodite we pass from the ridiculous to the sublime, in the battle of the gods our progress is in the reverse direction; as the Olym- pians march to the fray, the heavens thunder, the boundless earth trembles, and towering mountains start from their seats; the Lord of the Dead in panic leaps from his throne, thinking that the earth above him will be rent asunder and his pale realm laid bare to the eyes of men and of gods (T 54-66). The stage is set for Armageddon; the scene ought by rights to end in a cosmic holocaust, in a Gbtterddmmerungsfinale sung in hexameters. It does end with the goddesses jostling and scratching, making nasty remarks, slapping, and calling one another cats-at all of which Zeus laughs merrily (4 385-513). Such anomaly is not restricted within a few scenes; there is a general inconsistency between the delinquencies of the indi- vidual Olympians, who offend against even the most ele- 2 Walter Leaf, in the introduction to his commentary on 4, pronounces the Theomachy (385-513) " poetically bad" . . . "a ridiculous harlequinade " "poverty-stricken in expression" and maintains that "to attribute such work to any of the older poets of the Epos is to deny the possibility of any rational criticism in this field." For Wilamowitz, in Die Ilias und Homer (Berlin, 1920), its style is "die plumpe Erhabenheit" (292), "uiberhaupt eine barocke Ausartung des Stiles von E" (82). Gibbon writes in his journal (July 13, 1762), "The Battle of the Gods is worthy of everything Longinus says of it. It wotild be difficult to find another example which reunites so thoroughly every part of the sublime, both as to thought and language." Again (October 3), " I almost doubt which is most sublime, Homer's Battle of the Gods, or Longi- nus' Apostrophe to Terentianus upon it." Gibbon is of course thinking pri- marily of the introduction in T rather than of the actual combat in 4, and Finsler proposes to separate the two and attribute the latter to a late and bad continuator; cf. Homer I, part 2 (Leipzig, 1924), 215-217. It is however diffi- cult to imagine a stage in the composition of the poem at which the introduction to the Theomachy exists and not the Theomachy; cf. my "Higher Criticism on Olympus," A.J.P. LVIII (1937), 271f. Murray, commenting on Leaf's "poeti- cally bad," says (op. cit. 271), "True, yet the badness lies entirely in the taste, not in the execution. The verses are admirably written, incomparably better than those of Hesiod's Titanomachia."</page><page sequence="3">Vol. lxviii] Homer's Gods: Prolegomena 13 mentary notions of right and decency, and an underlying conviction that the blessed gods loathe unrighteousness and punish wickedness.3 Efforts to solve these problems have in general taken two directions. Separatists have tried to divide the poems neatly into strata, each exhibiting its characteristic treatment of the gods.4 Unitarians have sought to find some master formula by which anomalies can be explained without doing violence to the text.5 Neither method has proved fully successful; separatists have not been able to agree upon a theory of com- position, nor unitarians upon a formula. The obvious impii- cation is that the problem is more complex than critics have believed, too complex to be comprehended in a general for- mula or to admit of systematic analysis.6 I propose now merely to point out certain motifs and conventions which present themselves repeatedly in the poet's treatment of the Cf. Drerup, Homerproblem, 417f, Funftes Buch, 404 ff; T. D. Seymour, Life in the Homeric Age (New York, 1907), 397f. Seymour omits a number of the passages which imply that the gods approve and defend the right, and includes some which manifestly do not belong here; e.g., 6 329, OVK apETr KaKa ep-ya, is simply the popular adage "Honesty is the best policy" and its context ex- cludes it from consideration; a 807, o'v ,e'p yap T-L 6eoS adXT?,ALEpoS ErTLP, does not necessarily imply any ethical idea. There is room for a more exact study of this subject which will discriminate carefully between mere ritual piety and a view of the gods which invests them with ethical values; the best discussion I have seen is that of Andrew Lang (see note 1). 4 Among recent attempts, the most important are by Finsler and Wila- mowitz; these I have discussed, I think sufficiently, in my "Higher Criticism on Olympus" (see note 2), 257-274. On the general futility of this approach, cf. H. M. Chadwick, The Heroic Age (Cambridge, 1912), 257. A. Roemer, " Einige Probleme der Gottermaschine bei Homer," Homerische Aufsatze (Berlin, 1914), 144-210, would explain the interventions of the gods mainly by the scholiast's principle of wL6apo6rrs. Drerup, Finftes Buch, 394- 420; Homerproblem, 417-422, believes that the poet uses the gods primarily to emphasize by contrast the reality of the human characters and actions. C. Rothe, Die Odyssee als Dichtung (Paderborn, 1914), 257-264, stresses the deus ex machina, the freedom with which the poet uses the gods for artistic purposes, and their appearance in all important episodes. 6 Cf. E. Tieche in Finsler's Homer I, part 1 (Leipzig, 1924), 213: "Das homerische Gotterwesen ist ein so mannigfaches Gebilde, dass es nie gelingen wird. seinen Sinn mit einer einheitlichen Definition zu erschopfen."</page><page sequence="4">14 George M. Calhoun [1937 gods and to suggest that all of these be kept in mind, not singly, but rather collectively, in the explanation of particular passages. They will seem obvious; for the most part they have been observed; but they have not been considered col- lectively, since critics have usually chosen to follow their pet formulas or to apply their favorite criteria with but scant regard for other possibilities.7 Yet it is clear, at least from the point of view of psychology, that we cannot understand fully any single passage or episode unless we have potentially in mind all of the various ways in which the gods may present themselves to the poet's imagination, since any of them, or several, or all collectively, may influence his composition at any given moment.8 First, it is an established convention of the Homeric epic that a major character must be attended by gods, and great events in his career must be marked by supernatural manifes- tations. Although this seems obvious, it either is not fully understood or is not kept always in mind in the criticism of the poems. Unquestionably most modern readers and critics are distressed by the manner of Hector's death, the final cruel deceit practiced by Athena (X 214-247, 276f, 294-299), which to our feeling is as unfair as it is unnecessary; 9 and we are 7 Caiuer puts his finger on the fundamental weakness of contemporary Homeric criticism when he says, in Grundfragen der Homerkritik (Leipzig, 1923), 379, apropos of Tusko Reibstein's theories: "So hat sich Reibstein bei allem Scharfsinn doch ein tieferes Verstandnis selber dadurch verschlossen, dass er von vornherein und bis zuletzt nicht an verschiedene Mbglichkeiten der Erklarung dachte, sondern eine einzige, nachdem sie in ein paar Fallen wahrscheinlich gemacht war, tiberall zur Geltung zu bringen suchte." 8 This principle of criticism is equally valid whether the poems be ascribed to one author or to several, and my use of the singular "poet" is not intended to beg the question of single, dual, or multiple authorship. 9 Murray would "think it away" (op. cit. 315), and thereby, presumably, get nearer to the transcendental Iliad of his final conclusion. It is better to try to understand it. Roemer (op. cit. 203) rightly rejects the interpretation which "von einem dumpfen Pessimismus des Dichters spricht, der die Ohn- macht des Menschen gegeniiber den Gottern, und zwar niedrig gesinnten Gottern, anerkennt." When he remarks, casually, that "grosse und bedeu- tungsvolle Aktionen, wo Helden ersten Ranges auf dem Platze bleiben, sich nicht ohne Eingreifen der hoheren Machte bei dem Dichter abspielen," he is</page><page sequence="5">Vol. lxviii] Homer's Gods: Prolegomena 15 revolted by the cowardly assault of Apollo upon Patroclus (II 786-854). We forget that by epic convention it would be withholding the dignity which is Achilles' due were he per- mitted, at this supreme moment in the action, to slay Hector without the intervention of a god, and that the ineluctable fate of Patroclus is glorified by representing him as too mighty a warrior to be slain by human hand, unaided of heaven. So in the Odyssey the hero cannot be permitted to achieve the final rout and slaughter of the wooers without Athena to mark the moment of fate by flinging forth the dreadful aegis (x 297- 309). Instances may be cited almost without limit; the hero may be helped by a god, or opposed by a god, or both, but there must be gods as part of his pomp and panoply. Second, it is an epic convention, or at least a preference of the poet, that the hero, for all his divine entourage, shall act upon the human plane. The poet weaves his fabric from the threads of rational human action, and the supernatural is an embroidery or applique of ornamental design.'0 We do not find the wild imaginings of oriental tales or of our own fairy- land; 11 a god may make the hero invisible, or transfigure him, or inspire him with divine fire and vigor in every limb, but he is then expected to act within human limitations, somewhat enlarged, but never completely transcended. Perhaps the most striking instance of miraculous intervention is Apollo waving aloft the aegis of Zeus and trampling down the wall and trench of the Achaeans even as a child tramples down a toy fort of sand upon the seashore (O 306-327, 355-366). When the god has wrought this miracle to bring the Trojans into the camp of their foes, even then, the final assault, though stating the principle which I have just proposed, but his preoccupation with the 7rt6a6rt7s of the ancient critics seems to keep him from appreciating its true importance. 1' Cf. W. Leaf, Homer and History (London, 1915), 14f. 11 In 'Homer both gods and men bow before aiVayKfl, and fate is ineluctable; cf. the words of Achilles, 2 112-121. One might say that &amp;PacyK1c in such con- texts as this represents the limitation set by human reason; the past is past, the dead are dead, and there is no incantation or charm to bring them back.</page><page sequence="6">16 George M. Calhoun [1937 tempestuous as the surge of angry waves upon a headland of the shore, is an attack of human beings upon human beings (379-389). For all its fury, it is presently checked by the rallying defenders and the mighty Ajax (674-688). Hector, leading the charge, is thrust onward by the mighty hand of Zeus (694f), but only metaphorically, not literally, and the feelings of the combatants on either side are described in terms of purely human hopes and fears (699-702). Again, the heroes may have armor or weapons or other possessions that were wrought by Hephaestus, but usually they have received them from a human source; here also we are kept one remove from the supernatural.12 Homer's use of the divine as auxil- iary to human effort is well illustrated by Athena's role in the vengeance of Odysseus; the goddess intervenes repeatedly, at times miraculously, but nevertheless she expects the hero to win by his own prowess and to fight out his battle on the human plane.13 Third, certain primitive, naive conceptions of the gods are retained, despite their incompatibility with more advanced ideas, simply because they are an integral part of material that evidently was too popular with Homeric audiences to be discarded. The gods of ancient story in their primal habitat are less progressive than deities who have emigrated to the realm of the rational and the universal. It is significant that the gods who favor and protect the righteous, who dislike and punish evildoing, are usually spoken of collectively or in gen- eral terms.14 Now the Olympians originally were created in 12 Cf. Cauer, op. cit. 360f. Quite typical is the circumstance that the divine armor of Achilles is not wholly impervious; in T 259-272, the spear of Aeneas drives through the two outer layers (bronze) of the shield and is held by the third (gold); cf. 4 164f, 591-594. 13 Cf. my "T6lemaque et le plan de l'Odyss6e", R.E.G. XLVII (1934), 161f. 14 Zeus is the only god who functions individually in this high and noble capacity; since we are not told that any other of the Olympians defends the right, but only "the gods" or "god" or "Zeus", we might reasonably regard "Zeus" as a natural metonymy for the gods in general; cf. Erik Heden, Ho- merische Gbtlerstudien (Upsala, 1912), 50. However, practically every instance in which Zeus appears as the defender of right and justice involves specific</page><page sequence="7">Vol. lxviii] Homer's Gods: Prolegomena 17 human form,15 but in so far as they came to be identified with the general concept of divine authority, their ethical progress was free and unfettered, limited only by the rate at which human thought and ethical ideals progressed. As notions of human excellence and morality developed, they were naturally extended to include the divine power that was believed to govern the actions and the thoughts of men; thus the ethical conception of the gods, and of Zeus, in so far as he personifies that conception, tended to keep abreast of moral standards and ideas, and we come to what may be called- the gods of Homer's religion. On the other hand, when the poet wishes to tell an old myth or folk tale, the case is very different.'6 If he tells how Zeus beat Hera and hung her up by the hands and manhandled the lesser gods (0 18-25), or how Apollo and Hermes indulged in bawdy humor as they gazed on the amorous disarray of Aphrodite and her paramour (6 334-343), or how Hera tricked her lord and master by titillating his sexual appetites (153 if), he must keep the characters of these primordial tales; the Zeus, the Apollo, the Hermes, the Hera, all must be the figures of primitive mythology or folk tale. So, if we are to understand Homer's gods, we must be prepared to discriminate between the gods of his religion, or of his ethical thought, free to follow the onward march of his ideas, and the ancient, grotesque gods of myth, crystallized in their unchang- ing tradition like flies in amber, fettered, like the Titans, in adamantine bonds. offenses, perjury or violation of the rights of guests or suppliants, which belong from of old in his special province; cf. my " Zeus the Father in Homer", T.A .P.A. LXVI (1935), 16. Thus we are told (t 284) that Zeus hates evil deeds, but this is Zeus Xenios; in II 385-388, Zeus's anger at the perversion of justice, which finds appropriate expression in terrific storms and floods, may perhaps be equated with Oec2u' 067rt (388). 15 I am of course speaking of anthropomorphic gods, not of the dim begin- nings of religion. 16 A study of Homer's use of material from myth and folk tale, with particu- lar reference to the Olympian scenes, was communicated to the Philological Association of the Pacific Coast on November 26, 1937, under the title " Homer's Gods-Myth and Marchen." This I expect to publish in the near future.</page><page sequence="8">18 George M. Calhoun [1937 Fourth, the poet appreciated as fully as any genius of later times the importance of the comic interlude, or the scene in lighter vein; he understood fully that the grand style cannot go on indefinitely in an undisturbed succession of serious or tragic episodes. For this there are two reasons, one inherent in the relation of art to life, the other connected with the human limitations of those to whom art is addressed. The subject of the epic is heroic life, but it is life, and life is not all tragedy or grandeur; the large canvas must have its lights as well as its shadows, or it will lose its necessary connections with actuality. Nor can the poet neglect the emotional limi- tations of those to whom he speaks; he cannot play incessantly upon the more somber or the more exalted moods without inducing a state of emotional exhaustion in which response becomes impossible. If his theme is to extend beyond a few brief episodes, there must be touches of humor, scenes of comedy, perhaps even bits of sheer buffoonery. Now Homer, though he permits his heroes occasionally to indulge-with decent moderation in playfulness and in such wit and humor as become the warrior, prefers not to clothe them in motley.17 But he has ready to hand a rich array of comedians, with here and there real buffoons gravediggers, Bottoms, Gobbos, what you will-in the ancient figures of folktale and myth, the Olympians in their pristine naivete, and he uses them when comedy is needed. The somewhat startling way in which he intermingles the ridiculous with the reverent is less hard to understand if we put ourselves in the poet's place and reflect that the gods are always present to his mind in both of the aspects with which we are concerned witness centuries later 17 The only instance I can call to mind in which a chieftain appears in a frankly ridiculous situation is I 774-784, where the lesser Ajax is as clownish a figure as could be desired; throughout the games there is an undertone of skylarking, and the heroes are rather like boys let out of school. Thersites, the buffoon of B, is a physical weakling who cannot be classed with the major heroes (B 216-219), and the same can be said of Medon the herald, who pro- vides a touch of comedy in X 361-380, after the grim and bloody climax. For the artistic function of Thersites, cf. my "Classes and Masses in Homer," Class. Phil. xxix (1934), 305.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. lxviii] Homer's Gods: Prolegomena 19 the Dionysus of the Frogs, at once the august divinity of the festival and the chief buffoon of the play. Nor have we any reason to believe that the two were sharply contradistin- guished, as would be the case with ourselves; the aspects may alternate, but one dissolves into the other as readily as the changing patterns in the kaleidoscope. As the singer ends his lay of Aphrodite, the goddess who has just been exhibited. in the most ridiculous and indecent situation imaginable enters into her holy shrine and is transfigured into the great deity of universal love (0 362-366). In the Theomachy the gods march to battle awful as the primal cosmic forces (T 47-66), but they cannot be permitted to fight on this plane or the human char- acters vanish, the play is over, and the curtain falls on ultimate chaos. They must act on, or very nearly on, the human plane, and at once they become merely ridiculous; the Olym- pian fanfare which preludes the vengeance of Achilles is modu- lated into the conflict with the river god, and that in turn into a frankly comic interlude (4) 385-513), which throws into grimmer relief the death of Hector. Fifth, when gods are dramatis personae, they are subjected to the artistic necessities involved in the action; to this extent they must on occasion lay aside their godhead.18 Zeus, the omniscient, omnipotent ruler of men and of gods, must look the other way if Poseidon is to be introduced into the battle scenes of N, and he must become the very type of amorous imbecility in order to play his part in the Apate. The poetic economy of the scenes which lead up to the vengeance of Odysseus reduces the mighty goddess Athena to the role of the hero's female confidant. The gods know all things, but an omniscient Poseidon would have wrecked the plot of the Odyssey before it had begun to unfold. At times the immor- 18 This accounts for much of the material on which Hed6n bases his contrast between Volksglaube and epische Auffassung (op. cit. 21-25). These terms are scarcely broad enough to represent the facts; the gods are similarly limited in myths which do not appear in the epic and are clearly an integral part of popu- lar belief; on the other hand, if all conceptions of divinity not so limited be identified with Volksglaube, the term will be so expanded as to lose its meaning.</page><page sequence="10">20 George M. Calhoun [1937 tals lose their omnipotence merely because the poet wishes to work in a bit of gorgeous description.'9 So in the opening lines of N, Poseidon could have transported himself miracu- lously with the speed of thought from the peaks of Samothrace to the field of battle, but, had he done so, we should have been deprived of the stately progress which here adorns the poem. The Lord of the Waters surrenders his power of ubiquity, and we see him descend to Aegae in four stupendous strides that shake the lofty mountains; he yokes immortal steeds to his chariot of gold and drives over the surging sea so swiftly that the axles of his car ride dry above the rippling waves.20 Sixth, gods are often no more than the expression of imper- sonal agency, or chance.21 We say " much will happen," " something started up the mountain goats," "they were being married," "Helen bore no more children." Homer says "the gods will bring much to pass" (v 174), "the nymphs started up the goats" (t 154f), "the gods were fulfilling their mar- riage" (6 7), "the gods granted Helen no more children" 19 For passages which illtustrate the great variety introduced for artistic reasons into the comings and goings of gods, see my "Homeric Repetitions," Univ. Calif. Publ. Class. Phil. xiI 1 (1933), 15, note 46. 20 Another good example is of course the Theomachy, where the gods, if they are to take part in the battle, must fight on the human plane. 21 Oe-ol, Oe6o's, baipv, Zv's, though frequiently used in this sense, do not always refer to impersonal agency, or even to gods in general; as Ove Jbrgensen has shown in his important study, "Das Auftreten der Gotter in den Btichern L-A der Odyssee," Hermes XXXIX (1904), 357-382, these expressions are rare in the poet's narration, but very common in passages composed in the first person, where very often they refer to particular gods whose identity is supposed to be unknown to the speaker. On the basis of J6rgensen's study, Heden under- took to show that in general the speeches exhibit "einen dem Dichter vor- liegenden Volksglauben," and the poet's narrative "epische Auffassung" (op. cit. 21-25; see note 18), and made these general expressions the subject of an ex- haustive study (49-95). As he warns us, strict lines of classification cannot be drawn; I should treat as expressions of impersonal agency some instances which he interprets differently. For example, in Z 234-236 he finds a special sig- nificance in the interveintion of Zeus (94); in my opinion it is merely the poet's way of saying "Glaucus was simple enough to trade." The general problem is one of the most difficult and complex in Homer and can be only indicated here; it should include a study of the gods as the personifications of natural forces, impulses, etc.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. lxviii] Homer's Gods: Prolegomena 21 (0,'t 'OyVOV OVkfr' I4atvov, a 12). Zeus often serves this purpose, and Zv's aVrOs may come very close in tone to our expression "pure luck" (t 273, 310; cf. NEot abrot, 348, 357).22 Once Zeus is referred to as agent of the panics that put armies to flight ( 522), though at the moment in question Zeus the individual deity is snugly asleep in Hera's arms, and, had he been awake, would have been required by the plot to be helping the army that is being routed. Here an ancient variant reported in the scholia (oTrE ' Odso for ore re ZeVs) perhaps reveals the higher criticism in its incunabular stages. These are some of the matters that must be kept always in mind and taken always into account in interpreting even the simplest of the poet's statements about the gods. They must be better understood, or at least less often forgot or disre- garded, before we can say "Homer's ideas of the gods were thus and so." Closer attention to them might have withheld Finsler and Wilamowitz from considerable theorizing of very doubtful value upon the composition of the poems. Failure to distinguish between the gods of myth and of religion, be- tween the cosmic gods and the comic gods, made it easy for Gilbert Murray to say, of the Apate, with mournful unction, "Not all the riches of Egyptian Thebes could, I think, ever atone for the injury done to the human race by this invasion of the Milesian spirit into what is perhaps the greatest poem of the greatest nation of poets that the world has known. It has defiled its own beautiful world. It has 'slain the image *of God, as it were, in the eye.'" This statement, in my opin- ion, adds nothing to our understanding of Homer. Since it suits the poet's complex of aims to introduce the gods for effects so different, to emphasize aspects so diverse, to shape divinity now in one form and now in another, the mere compilation of passages in which the gods appear yields a nexus of contradictions upon which generations of higher 22 These expressions become a mannerism in this story, and we get the im- pression that the poet is following contemporary habits of speech, which accords with Heden's suggestion that the speeches exhibit contemporary popular belief (see note 21).</page><page sequence="12">22 George M. Calhoun [1937 critics have gorged themselves gleefully.23 Sound criticism demands that each allusion and each attribution be considered in the light of all that can be learned regarding the artistic function of the episode and the problems of technique it involves. To take but a single example, this will make it clear at once why Hephaestus, who wears the motley in A, becomes the stately personification of his art in 1 we need not, with Wilamowitz, assume two poets, one slyly waggish and the other a pious sentimentalist. The distinctions which have made it convenient to group references to the gods under one or another of these heads should not be too greatly emphasized, nor erected into final criteria of objective classification. It is quite impossible to construct a rigid system within which every instance will fall neatly into place. Our problems are only incidentally and to a minor degree those of logic; they are much more problems of psychology, the psychology of the artist whose art we are seeking to understand. And this artist is usually influenced by a complex of purposes and moods, many of them not con- sciously present to his mind; seldom is an utterance of any length the result of a single, simple stimulus. At one moment he is guided by logic, at another by feeling; now by the half remembered cadence of a phrase and now by the beauty of a visual image; again by the imaginative content of a single word or merely the harmony of its sounds, and sometimes, unquestionably, by the habit of rounding out a line with an appropriate and pleasing formula. And to these more general 23 Seymour's compilation is introduced with the comment, "Here are great inconsistencies, though not such as to aid as yet in the analysis of the poems into earlier and later elements" (op. cit. 395). After one has waded through the a priori theorizing to which these inconsistencies have given rise, it is refreshing to turn to the admirable essay of Paul Friedldnder, "Lachende Gotter", Die Antike x (1934), 209-226. Friedlander rejects unequivocally the view that passages in which the gods are made ridiculous are late or in any way incompatible with reverence: "Weder bei Homer noch bei Aristophanes ist das Lachen uber die Gotter ein Zeichen unfromm gewordenen Sinnes. Die homerischen Gotterszenen sind nicht 'spat', sondern sie gehoren zum festen Bestande der homerischen Dichtung, das Lachen der Gotter zum Bestande der homerischen Welt" (225f).</page><page sequence="13">Vol. lxviii] Homer's Gods: Prolegomena 23 factors must be added the specific problems of plot and narra- tive that come up from moment to moment as the action moves on. We must believe that any of the gods was always present to the poet's subconscious mind in all of the various aspects of which I have spoken. Aphrodite, for example, was clothed in infinite variety; she was one among the supreme rulers of the universe, arbiters of human destiny, defenders of moral values; she was also a figure in ancient, grotesque myths and naive tales, and at the same time one of the principal actors in the drama at Troy; she was sexual passion and also spiritual love, the deity of procreation and the personification of the impulses into which love and passion are translated; she was the vision of a bright effulgence moving in the heavens, a gracious presence instinct with -loveliness; she was the music that breathes in Ka'XEL . a6p4poaloo, oloo 7rEp Evo-7-avos KvONpEta 24 Xpterat, E67- apo 177 Xap'LTWV X?P?v 1/uEpO'EP7a.4 All these varied aspects of divinity are blended and fused in the poems precisely as are the changing moods and purposes in the mind of the poet. It would be hard to say whether the lines just quoted owe more to the singer's memory of beautiful sounds or to his visual imagination. The continual definite relationship between the manifold aspects of divinity and the artistic problems that arise as the narrative proceeds may be illustrated from almost any of the episodes. Let us take for example F. The scene on the wall 24 a 192-194. I have tried to sum up the effect of all the scenes in which Aphrodite appears, the passing allusions; and the epithets. Line and verse cannot be given for "a bright effulgence moving in the heavens," but i'nstances of gods moving in superhuman splendor or majesty (e.g. A 75-84; fE 864-867; A 47) suggest that the epithet Xpvrae1, XpvaE&amp; so often applied to Aphrodite, and, I believe, to her alone, means more than merely blonde or decked with gold, the interpretations favored by Seymour (op. cit. 435).

Calhoun [1937 is its own justification, and its paramount value is the delinea- tion of Helen's personality. It must be motivated and worked into the narrative, which means that Helen must be brought to the wall from the palace, where naturally enough she is weaving at her loom. A modern author would be content to let her hear the news of the impending duel as it was cried through the town, or simply from the lips of a human Laodice. But the epic poet will not have his heroine make her first appearance without divine attendance; hence it is Iris in the guise of Laodice who comes to her with the news and inspires her with a sweet longing for home and parents and for her former husband (F 121 ff). The intervention here of Iris is an instance of the divine entourage inseparable from the comings and goings and doings of the chief characters; but it may be viewed also as an instance of a god as impersonal agent, for Iris is in a way the personification of the impulse that sends Helen to the scene of action. Aphrodite makes her entrance at F 374, to rescue Alexander; she is here a character in the play, doing what it is her personal interest to do, but at the same time she provides the divine entourage at the critical moment of the duel between two heroes who are again for the nonce the protagonists. Helen's return to the palace for the concluding scene with Alexander is needed to complete the presentation of her character and her situation. Why is the messenger this time Aphrodite and not Iris? Who can say? The poet might have told us, if we grant that he ever analyzed his unconscious moods and motives.25 Perhaps it is because Aphrodite is conveniently at hand; perhaps because the greater goddess invests the episode with greater dignity; perhaps because she so admirably personifies the warring emo- tions that end in Helen's reluctant compliance with her para- mour's desire. Or again she may be merely one of the dramatis personae, seeking to soothe the ruffled spirit of her favorite by bringing to him the woman he loves. In any case, without 25 Cf.

Whatever the result of our analysis, we have a complex pattern; the goddess is at once the divine entourage, the personification of the impulses that jar and clash in Helen's bosom, and an actor in the drama who follows her own purposes. This is, I believe, a fair example of the ways in which the gods appear in Homer under one or another of these various aspects, aspects which are ever changing, combining, shifting, and dissolving one into another, appearing now singly and now in complicated patterns. It should make clear the im- possibility of rigid classifications, and should warn us that as critics it is our first duty to have always in mind all the possi- bilities, but not our right to fix dogmatically upon one and to neglect others. Objective interpretation is a difficult goal, but we can come very close to it by honestly exploring all possibilities without insisting upon one or another to the ex- clusion of the rest. At the same time, this very complexity precludes our dispensing with analysis altogether. We are trying to understand, as definitely and as fully as we can, each of the varying aspects under which the gods were present to the poet's mind, and some classification will be needed if we are to speak intelligibly, within reasonable limits of space, of all that has come to the poet, through a lifetime of listen- ing, reflecting, imagining, singing, about divinities whose airy substance emanates from the hopes and fancies and the poetic intuitions of untold generations of men. Finally, these ex- amples should make clear the futility of the attempt to recon- struct a "Homeric theology" -and upon that reconstruction to reconstruct the history of the poems-without some atten- tion to the intricate patterns of the poet's artistry.</page></plain_text>
