<plain_text><page sequence="1">EUHEMERUS AND THE HISTORIANS TRUESDELL S. BROWN UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EUHEMERUS is one of the most elusive and disconcerting writers in the Hellenistic period. He survives chiefly in the pages of Diodorus Siculus, who almost certainly had not taken the measure of his author. Our other chief source of information comes from the translation made by the poet Ennius, which in turn is known only through the works of later writers, who cited him for pur- poses of their own. Other authors have paid Euhemerus the compliment of imitating him, and something of their work has survived, also in fragments. Philo of Byblus wrote in the same spirit, and recent excavations at Ras Shamra have shown that his Phoenician History must be taken much more seriously than has been the fashion.' Under these circumstances it may be worth while to re-examine the Euhemeristic tradition in an attempt to define its characteristics and its influence on the writing of his- tory. In a sense Euhemerism did not begin with Euhemerus, because the elements of his theory were present before he wrote. Never- theless, the combination of old ideas was new, and could not have been made before the deeds of Alexander suggested a part of the pattern. The following is a summary of his work, so far as the extant fragments permit.2 Euhemerus purports to be the trusted friend of Cassander, for whom he undertook numerous journeys.3 On one occasion he sailed from Arabia Felix, and after a long voyage southward into the Arabian sea he reached a group of islands; three of them were Hiera, where burial was forbidden, another island nearby which was used as a cemetery, and the large island of Panchaea, from the eastern tip of which the 1 See Otto Eissfeldt, Ras Schamra und Sanchunjaton, in the Beitrdige zur Reli- gionsgeschichte des Altertums, No. 4, Halle, 1939, PP. 1-157, esp. p. 29. 2 The text followed is that of Felix Jacoby, Die Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker, vol.

Tithes are levied on them by the kings.5 A more detailed account is given of the island of Panchaea with its mixed popu- lation of Panchaeans, Oceanites, Indians, Scythians and Cretans. The chief city is Panara, whose inhabitants are called Suppliants of Tri- phylian Zeus. They alone among the islanders have no king. Instead they enjoy their own laws and elect three annual magistrates, who settle all legal suits not involving the death penalty. Capital offenses are judged by the priests.6 Sixty stades from Panara stands a temple in honor of Triphylian Zeus, which is much admired for its magnificence, its antiquity and its setting. It lies in a paradise of bubbling springs, tall shade trees, beautiful singing birds and a profusion of fruits. Around the temple and the sacred spring called Water of Helios is an enclosure forbidden to everyone except the priests. The whole temple area is sacred to the gods, and the income derived from it is used to maintain the sacrifices.' Beyond this temple district is a high mountain dedi- cated to the gods and named Seat of Uranus. The inhabitants say that in olden days when Uranus ruled the world he lived on this mountain, from which he observed the heavens and the stars. In later days the mountain came to be called Triphylian Olympus, from the three peoples who formerly lived there - the Panchaeans, the Oceanites and the Doii. The last-named were later expelled by Ammon.8 The people of Panchaea are divided into the three classes of priests, farmers and soldiers. The artisans are assigned to the priests, while the shepherds are associated with the soldiers. Euhemerus goes on to describe their social system in some detail. Farm production is encouraged by prizes offered for the greatest yield, and enterprising shepherds are similarly rewarded. Private property is limited to house and yard. All else is owned in common and assigned by the priests, each of whom receives double the ordinary share of everything. The priests claim to be of Cretan origin, having been brought to Panchaea by Zeus. In evidence they point out Cretan peculiarities in their speech.9 The central part of Euhemerus' account appears to have been his elaborate description of the shrine of Triphylian Zeus, containing a golden stele with the deeds of Uranus, Cronus and Zeus engraved upon it in Panchaean 10 writing or else in the Egyptian 'Ibid., combining F 2 from Diod.

The exploits of Artemis and Apollo had also been en- graved on the stele at a later date by Hermes.12 This inscription relates that Uranus was the first king, a benefactor to man and versed in the movements of the stars. He was the first to honor the heavenly gods with sacrifices, and thus obtained his name of Uranus.13 His wife Hestia bore him two sons and two daughters, Titan, Cronus, Rhea and Demeter. Cronus followed his father, and married his sister Rhea, by whom he had Zeus, Hera and Poseidon. Zeus succeeded to the throne and fathered the Curetes, Persephone and Athena. Zeus was a great conqueror, visiting almost all lands and being universally acknowledged as a god. It was Zeus who returned to Panchaea and set up an altar to Uranus.14 Other scattered fragments about Zeus tell us that he fought a long war against the Titans; that he was the first to establish law and order for man; that he abolished cannibalism; that he acted as a judge; that he gave audience to anyone who had found out something beneficial to man; that he ordered his own worship everywhere; and that he was finally buried at Cnossus in Crete.15 Less flattering state- ments are made about Aphrodite - that she instituted the profession of courtesan, and about Cadmus - that he once cooked for the ruler of Sidon and then eloped with the flute girl, Harmonia.16 Perhaps a clearer idea of Euhemerus' own position and in- fluence on later writers may be gained by separating out the " Ibid., F 3 from Diod. Sic. V, 46, 5-8. It may be that Euhemerus mentioned two stelae, one in the shrine on Triphylian Olympus, the other in the valley temple, one written in Panchaean and the other in Egyptian characters. 12 That Hermes should have written in Egyptian would have seemed appropriate to the Hellenistic Greeks, who identified Hermes with the Egyptian scribe god, Thoth. 13 Carl Langer argues plausibly to show that Euhemerus did not describe the otptciot 8Goi as independent of and antecedent to the Oeol etPye'rat, but rather that this distinction is the work of Diodorus. See "Euhemeros und die Theorie der PwCret und 0c'reL c ol,o" in ArrEA02, vol. 2, Leipzig, 1926, pp. 53-59.

The notion of a people far away, either in time or place, who lived a happy life in ideal surroundings was well established in Greek tradition, and the possibilities had already been explored by poets, historians and philosophers. We have only to remember the Ethiopians of Homer," and the happy lot of man before Pandora in Hesiod,81 and the idealized Hyperboreans of Herod- otus,19 and the tale of the lost Atlantis in Plato,20 and the de- scriptions of idealized peoples in Theopompus,21 to mention only a few familiar examples. The purpose of these idealized descrip- tions varied with the character of the writer, and might range from pure entertainment to a biting attack on contemporary society. Both elements are usually present. Naturally the plausi- bility of any particular account is an index to the skill of the author, as the effects of Plato's Critias on undisciplined imagina- tions abundantly testify. It would obviously be as absurd to accuse Plato of deceiving his readers as to make a similar charge against Cervantes. Caveat lector! Likewise there was ample precedent for the association of philanthropy in the broad Greek sense, with divine honors. Heracles is merely the most conspicuous example among many, while historic personages like Lysander and Plato had also been honored by a shrine and sacrifices.22 It is well to note, however, 17 Odyssey I, 22ff. 1s Hesiod, Works and Days, 90off. 19 Herodotus, Hist.

VIII, 464ff.; Charlesworth p. 8). This is particularly interesting because of its early date, and also because of the promise of divine honors to a living person. Charlesworth also</page><page sequence="5">EUHEMERUS AND THE HISTORIANS 263 that deification was still a spontaneous act, either a recognition of services rendered or a lively anticipation of favors to come. It was scarcely a political device employed in the interests of absolutism until after Alexander.23 The tendency to rationalize stories of gods and heroes was also a venerable one, and involved two opposite points of view. Some writers tried to historicize the myths by explaining away the miraculous details as poetic exaggeration or allegory, leaving in their place a prosaic narrative of events as they might actually have occurred. Herodotus, for example, rationalizes the stories about Io and about the Trojan war.24 Other writers start at the opposite pole with two assumptions, that the gods exist and that they are ideal beings. From this point of view they reject as false, statements made about the gods in Homer or elsewhere that represent them as deceitful, boastful, amorous or subject to any human frailty.25 Both groups accept the myths of gods and heroes as source material which has an ascertainable relationship to the truth. Atheism in the modern sense was probably unknown, simply because the Greeks, unlike the Hebrews, had no concep- tion of, "God with a capital G." 26 Furthermore, Euhemerus, himself, is careful to distinguish between the heavenly gods and the Olympian deities - unless Diodorus has misrepresented him. In no extant fragment does he cast doubt on the existence of the former. Ideal commonwealths like that of the Panchaeans had already been described, not only by Plato and Theopompus, but doubt- less by many other writers before Alexander's time. Literary utopias were sufficiently common in Aristophanes' day to furnish points out the essential similarity between the honors paid to gods and to heroes (pp. 9-To). Perhaps the distinction is comparable to that between "beatus" and "saint." SSee M. P. Charlesworth, op. cit., p. 14. 2 For Io see Herodotus, Hist. I, Iff; for the Trojan war, ibid., II, Ii8ff. 25 Xenophanes rebukes Homer and Hesiod for ascribing human weaknesses to the gods.

Robert von Pbhlmann may have been right in connecting the tripartite division of the Panchaeans with Hippodamus of Miletus, but his account of Euhemerus as a whole is marred by references to modern social- ism which do not apply.27 There is certainly no reason to suspect Euhemerus of making use of accounts of the caste system in India or the class system in Egypt.28 Because all of these tendencies were present in Greek literature before Alexander, the question naturally arises, "What remains that may fairly be called Euhemeristic?" The answer appears to lie in Euhemerus' new arrangement of well known elements, in the employment of new illustrative material and in the subordina- tion of everything to a new end. That is to say that Euhemerus belonged to a generation with problems of its own and a dis- tinctive outlook. Prominent in the foreground was the fact of Alexander's career. Its effects were as great in the intellectual as in the political realm. While his memory was still warm no imagi- native writer could well resist the wealth of information and misinformation gathered by Alexander's subordinates and dis- seminated in popular accounts. The world of Plato must have seemed incredibly small when first hand accounts began to pour in from Egypt and the East, partly written records and partly stories told by Alexander's veterans. As Karl Triidinger says, there had been no such inpouring of new facts about strange places and peoples and customs since the old Ionian days, and the beginnings of Greek historical inquiry.29 It was an age of strong personalities and bewildering changes in which few could afford to look ahead with confidence. The Greek found it neces- sary to adjust himself intellectually to the new forces at large in the world. There were staunch conservatives like Theopompus who continued to look backwards,"3 and there were men of 'Robert von P6hlmann, Geschichte der sozialen Frage und des Sozialismus in der antiken Welt, 2 vols., 2nd ed., Munich, 1912, vol. 2, pp. 372-387.

To these men Euhemerus must have made an immediate appeal. Euhemerus was not the first writer to edit the stories about the gods by introducing details obviously borrowed from Alexander's conquest. At least three writers preceded him in this, Hecataeus of Abdera, Leon of Pella and Megasthenes. Megasthenes de- scribes Dionysus' progress through India, and depicts him as a city founder and a civilizer in definitely Hellenistic terms,31 Leon of Pella had a similar viewpoint, and his influence may well have been considerable, but the extant fragments of his work do not enable us to do him justice.32 Hecataeus was used by Euhemerus,33 and we have considerable portions of his Aegyptiaca embedded in the pages of Diodorus Siculus. The extent to which Euhemerus was anticipated by Hecataeus will probably never be known. For our purposes it is more important to notice the way in which the same tendencies appear in different writers during the generation following Alexander. For this shows that Euhemerus' work was characteristic of the period.34 What could be more comforting or more plausible to a generation suffering from the violence of self- made kings than to transfer the whole disquieting social situa- tion back into the more respectable world of myth? The dazzling achievements of Alexander took on a reassuring familiarity when Zeus ceased to be a Homeric king and became a Hellenistic despot.

Jacoby ("Euemeros," No. 3, Pauly-Wissowa-Kroll, vol. 6, col. 970) points out that Euhemerus himself, appears to have introduced the idea of self-deification. The imperfect state of our knowledge about Leon and Hecataeus makes it impossible for us to be sure. In any event this was a detail obviously borrowed from the career of Alexander.</page><page sequence="8">266 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The choleric wielder of the thunderbolt turns into a civilized being who acts in accordance with reason, and who justifies his ex- alted position by the benefits he confers upon mankind. Here Euhemerus seems to have made a wider appeal than Hecataeus, for Hecataeus purports to deal only with the gods of Egypt, while Euhemerus explains the Olympian gods themselves. Also, Heca- taeus seems to have stressed the great antiquity, hence superiority, of Egyptian customs, while his explanation of the origin of the gods is subordinated to that end. The first temptation for anyone reading the fragments of Euhemerus or Hecataeus to-day, is to assume that they were written satirically. Even investigators of the stature of Franz Susemihl and Felix Jacoby have contributed to the notion that Euhemerus was trying to deceive his readers, or that he was a scoffer.35 Ulrich Wilcken, however, has performed a useful service in insisting on the genuine religious feeling associated with the worship of Alexander,36 a feeling that would find support rather than ridicule in Euhemerus' views. While it is probably true that Euhemerism somewhat lowered the conception of the Olympian gods, it is equally clear that humanity was corre- spondingly elevated by the deification of benefactors of the human race, and that an incentive was held out to future rulers to earn deification by worthy deeds. Perhaps ancient attacks on Euhemerus can partly be explained by the fact that his views were not made official; on the whole the Hellenistic rulers pre- ferred to base their own deification on descent from the Olympian gods.37 Before leaving Euhemerus to discuss his influence on later writers, it may be worth while to call attention to his use of documentary evidence, for this comes to be an essential part of the tradition.

Official reports on all matters had to be made in writing, whether their purpose was military or scientific,38 and the practise arose of keeping a documentary record of day by day occurrences. The growing interest in source material is abundantly illustrated in the period following Alex- ander by the individual compilations of men like Craterus, Pole- mon, Diodorus and Heliodorus,39 and also by the growth of libra- ries ranging in size from private collections all the way up to the state-supported library at Alexandria. The written record also played a more important part in everyday life.40 During Alex- ander's march continual use had to be made of interpreters, and the language difficulties became a problem that even interested popular writers. Onesicritus mentions the interpreters in his vivid account of the naked philosophers in India, and both he and Aristobulus were interested in the writing as well as the mean- ing of Persian inscriptions.41 Therefore it is altogether fitting that Euhemerus described both the monuments and the writing of the assumed sources of his information.

The fragments, largely preserved in Diodorus Siculus, show that he wrote about the Argonauts, the Amazons, the Atlantans and about the Libyan-born Dionysus.43 His writing is a patchwork in which some details may be traced back to Herodotus and be- yond, while others clearly derive from the Alexander historians. His explanation of the origin of the gods is definitely Euhemer- istic. Unlike Euhemerus his sole purpose appears to have been to entertain, and in pursuing this end he combined details from entirely separate myths into a brightly colored whole, with in- discriminate lavishness.44 He was not bothered by discrepancies, but rationalized the material that lay immediately before him, without regard for what he had already said. Scytobrachion's relationship with the Euhemeristic tradition may be considered under the following heads: plausibility, idealized descriptions, details suggested by Alexander and the Diadochi, and his concep- tion of the gods. So far as we can judge by what remains, Scytobrachion was not nearly as successful in creating the illusion of truth as Euhemerus had been, but he followed much the same pattern. In support of his narrative about Dionysus, Scytobrachion tells us that Linus recorded his deeds and other mythological matters in his Hy- pomnemata, which were written in Pelasgian letters. In the time of Orpheus, Thymoetas, a great traveller, crossed Libya all the way to Ocean. He interviewed the Nysaeans, who had preserved legends of Dionysus' upbringing in Nysa; then he wrote the Phrygian Poem, consulting the ancient sources."5 Jacoby also thinks it likely that Scytobrachion invented a Dionysius of Miletus as a source from whom he pretended to obtain informa- tion."4 Like Euhemerus, Scytobrachion explains supernatural "'See E.

As Schwartz sug- gested, he may have been influenced by contemporary specula- tion and attempts to circumnavigate Africa,"4 but he is probably returning to the older literature about the west.5o In describing Nysa Scytobrachion follows the usual utopian tradition of at- tributing health and long life to the inhabitants, but he resembles Euhemerus in not making that life miraculously long."5 Scytobrachion's fragments include many details suggested by Hellenistic history. We notice that the Amazon queen be- haves very much like Alexander, and we also find in the descrip- tion of the way of life among the Amazons a paradoxical in- version of the normal social relations that would have delighted Herodotus.52 The reversal of the role of the sexes has special point in the Hellenistic period, when one thinks of women like Olympias or Arsinoe. It is curious to see the Amazons founding cities and naming them after their chief officers, and also to find their conquered territory referred to as "spear won land," in good Ptolemic fashion.53 Women are prominent also in the account of Dionysus, and in the decisive battle Athena supports Dionysus with a female army.54 Dionysus, like Alexander and the Suc- cessors, has a special group of devoted followers - the 200 Co-vrpoof.55 More specific reference to Alexander is implied "4A rather distressing example is his derivation of the name, "Zeus," from the fact that Zeus helped people to "live" well (i.e. Z^va from KaXw ~Pj).

His gods have been deified because of their services in civilizing and otherwise benefitting man."1 As with Euhemerus, early deification is asso- ciated with knowledge of the stars."59 A good deal is made of the wickedness of Cronus. He has two conventionally bad qualities of impiety (Jo-E'~fELa) and greed (rrXEovEeta). For a time he gov- erns the western world, and his methods may have reminded readers of actual rulers like Cassander. He holds down his un- willing subjects by building strong forts on high places."6 Zeus is a father to his people, and rules the whole world, doing good to man. He fulfills the qualifications of a good ruler outlined by the Indian sage in speaking to Onesicritus, i.e. he punishes evil doers and benefits the people."' These traits are also found in Dionysus, whose invading army is well-disciplined and friendly to the natives.62 Alexander, too, was remembered as a strict dis- ciplinarian who had forbidden indiscriminate pillaging. It is worth noting that Dionysus is first acknowledged as a god by the captives whom he unexpectedly forgave."3 Wilcken has shown that Alexander's deification was intended for the Greeks, not for his own people the Macedonians, and also that his acceptance as " Ibid., p. 244 from Diod. Sic. III, 73, i. The rehandling of the Dionysus stories is an excellent example of the impact of Alexander's career on literature. It has been convincingly shown that the close connection between Alexander and Dionysus was invented after Alexander's death under Ptolemaic auspices, and that Dionysus' exploits as a conqueror came as a result of his association with Alexander.

We find a rather elaborate account of Basileia, who possessed all the virtues and who was so solicitous of her brothers' welfare that she was like a mother to them. In return she won the name of Great Mother, and with the approval of the people she inherited her father's kingdom as a virgin queen. To provide successors for the throne she married her brother Hyperion, to whom she bore two beautiful children, Helios and Selene. The other brothers jealously murdered Hyperion and also young Helios. His sister Selene was so "fond of her brother" (fLX6a,@Xog) that she killed herself. Later, Helios appeared to his mother in a dream and explained that he and his sister had been made immortal and that vengeance would overtake her enemies. As a result, divine honors were given the brother-sister pair. In this passage we have clear reference to the cult of Phila- delphus and his sister wife Arsinoe, and a historical justification of their worship.65 The Euhemeristic view had narrowed some- what. Not only did benefactors become rulers and win immortal honors, but the implication was that rulers as such were entitled to worship. The use of a dream is also inconsistent with the purely rational explanations in Euhemerus; an element of mysticism has been added."66 Euhemerism was becoming stereotyped, and much of the genuine religious appeal of the original has been lost. Philo of Byblus takes us into a much later period. We are told by Suidas that he was born in the reign of Nero, that he lived a long time, and that he was contemporary with the em- peror Hadrian; 67 so we may safely place Philo in the first part of the second century A.D. Among other works Philo wrote a Phoenician History in eight or nine books,"6 the first part of which " Wilcken, "Zur Ensteh. d. K6nig.," Sitzb. Preuss. Akad., 1938, p. 305. 5 See Jacoby, F. Gr. H., vol. I, pp. 236-237, Dionys. F 7 from Diod. Sic. III, 57, 3-6. The Egyptian brother-sister marriage of Isis and Osiris was a happy coincidence, but it is to be doubted whether the cult of the Oeoi d&amp;eX0oil was ever viewed from the standpoint of the Egyptian. See Rostovtzeff, Soc. and Econ. Hist. of Hell. World, vol. I, p. 268. 66The resemblance between the family life of the Great Mother and what we learn about that of the Ptolemies may be kept in mind. 7 See Miller, F. H. G., vol. 3, p. 56o.

The whole purports to be a Greek translation of a work written in Phoenician by Sanchunia- thon of Berytus, who lived before the Trojan war."9 Not content with mentioning his authority, Philo describes the methods and also the sources of Sanchuniathon. He tells us the historian wrote an account of the Jews based on Hierombalus, priest of Yahweh (Ieuo), who had dedicated his own commentaries to Abelbalus, King of Berytus.70 Sanchuniathon is also supposed to have used the Book of Thoth (Taautus), and to have gathered together materials preserved in the shrines in the obscure "Ammonian" writing." After diligent researches Sanchuniathon was able to expose the contradictions and the allegories in the works of the priests, and to reconstruct the true account of the early days.72 Philo says that subsequently the facts were once more obscured both by Greek writers and by priestly interpretation, and he proposes to restore the true account.7" Unfortunately, our own knowledge of Philo and hence of Sanchuniathon rests chiefly on fragments preserved in Eusebius' Praeparatio Evangelica. As a Christian apologist the fourth century bishop of Caesarea was very much interested in Philo because Philo explained the gods as deified men, and also because a pagan controversialist, Por- phyry, regarded Philo as trustworthy.7 It was Eusebius' object to refute the pagans, not to recover the history of Phoenicia. His quotations from Philo, therefore, do not give us an accurate picture of the work, but are confined to more sensational state- ments. Modern writers, unconsciously influenced by Eusebius, have been inclined to regard Philo's work as an elaborate hoax, and have treated Philo in the same spirit as they have treated Dionysius Scytobrachion.75 9 Ibid., p. 563, Philo F I, 2 from Euseb.

" For this view, see ibid., p. 561, where Miller alludes to Philo's alleged use of Sanchuniathon and says that no one now denies that this is a falsehood, etc. It is well to remember also that Xanthus the Lydian, Scytobrachion's alleged source, is now regarded as genuine. See above n. 46. For a general warning against accepting the charge of "forgery" against later ancient writers, see Eduard Meyer, Gesch. d. Alt., vol. 3, 2nd ed., 1937, p. 209, n. I.</page><page sequence="15">EUHEMERUS AND THE HISTORIANS 273 The results of the excavations at Ras Shamra force us to re- consider this judgment. Among the new materials for study is a considerable body of religious texts going back to about 1500 B.C., before there could have been any Greek influence, and giving us many stories about Phoenician gods, such as the epic of Alijan and Mot.7" There are numerous instances where divine names appearing in Philo of Byblus recur in the Ras Shamra texts, giving the lie to the notion that Philo invented them,77 while the peculiarities of the twenty-eight letter Ras Shamra alphabet even suggest an origin for the mysterious "Ammonian" letters mentioned by Philo.78 The possibilities opened up by these documents for evidence of Oriental influences on the early Greeks are so arresting, that it must be tempting to an Oriental- ist to overstate his case. Eissfeldt shows good judgment and rare moderation when he refuses to attribute Philo's Euhemeristic ideas to Sanchuniathon,79 but in return no classicist should refuse to admit that Philo was using authentic Phoenician sources. These discoveries also suggest the use of the fragments of Philo to re- construct the original account of Sanchuniathon, and to explain parts of the Ras Shamra texts. But from the point of view of Euhemerism the important result is the exoneration of Philo, who must now be regarded as a reputable historian. Why should such a person, living in the time of Hadrian, attribute Euhemeris- tic ideas to the Phoenicians? The most obvious explanation may well be the correct one, that Philo himself believed that the anthropomorphic gods were men, deified for their benefactions, or because of the terror that they inspired." He may even have sought and found confirmation of his views in the Phoenician accounts about the gods. His patriotic insistence on the antiquity of the Phoenician cities would have led him to attribute his point of view to a Phoenician rather than to a Greek.

While this distinction may not go back to Euhemerus,s' it is a part of a tradition preserved in Diodorus which came to be accepted as "Euhemeristic," and it is difficult to imagine that Philo was not conscious of the source of his inspiration.82 Philo's work is evidence that Euhemerism continued as a force well down into the Roman empire, without losing its identity, like so many other Hellenistic ideas, in the all-embracing Stoa. s" See above n. 13. 82 See Miiller, F.
