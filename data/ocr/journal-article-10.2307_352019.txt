<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALEXA ALBERT University of Rhode Island KRIS BULCROFT University of Washington* Pets, Families, and the Life Course The psychological and emotional roles played by pets in the urban household are examined. Telephone interviews were conducted with 320 pet owners and 116 nonowners in Providence, Rhode Island. Respondents were obtained from a systematic random sample of the telephone direc- tory. Sociodemographic differences exist between pet owners and those who do not have pets. Remarried people, families with children present, and families in the "middle" stages of the life cy- cle are most likely to have pets, whereas pet ownership is low among widows, empty-nesters, families with infants, and those with annual in- comes of $8,000 or less. Responses to the survey indicate that pets are viewed as important family members by people who live in the city. However, the roles played by pets are related to the social structure of the household. Attachment to pets is highest among never-married, divorced, widowed and remarried people, childless couples, newlyweds, and empty-nesters. Never-married, divorced, and remarried people, and people without children present, are also most likely to anthropomorphize their pets. Pet attachment and anthropomorphism are also related to type of pet. Both dimensions of pet-human bonds are highest among people who have dogs. The findings of the survey are discussed within the framework of family development theory and changing house- hold composition in the United States. Department of Sociology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI 02881. *Institute of Aging, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105. Over half of American households have a pet of some kind, while only 34% include children (Cain, 1983; Purvis and Otto, 1976; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1985). Yet, to date, none of the leading family studies journals have presented research based on systematically collected, em- pirical data on the role of the pet in the American household. This absence of empirical data is in- teresting since, as Bossard and Boll note in their text on the sociology of child development written almost 30 years ago, "The role of the domestic pet in family life and child development has been neglected for the most part by serious students, despite their obvious importance" (Bossard and Boll, 1960: 206). Although a number of recent studies have ex- amined the dimensions of pet-human relation- ships, this research has been conducted primarily by scholars from other disciplines such as psychology and the health professions. In par- ticular, attention has been paid to the role of pets in therapy (e.g. Brickel, 1979; Corson, Corson, and Guynne, 1975; Levinson, 1961). Other re- searchers have examined the relationship between pet ownership and factors such as personality traits (Edelson and Lester, 1983), mental health (Mugford and M'Comisky, 1975), achievement (Bustad, 1980), and physical health and recovery from illness (Friedmann, Katcher, Lynch, and Thomas, 1979). The theories and concepts underlying this research are therapeutic or physiological in nature and do not enhance our understanding of the day-to-day roles played by pets in America and how these roles vary by household type. One can only speculate about the apparent lack of interest in the household pet among family Journal of Marriage and the Family 50 (May 1988): 543-552 543</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Marriage and the Family scholars. Perhaps pets have been overlooked in family studies because it is difficult for the objec- tive and rational social scientist to consider them as potential "members" in the family system. In a similar fashion, children are frequently excluded in the study of family power, responses to transi- tions, and communication structures. Further, even the most cursory perusal of family journals over the past few decades would lead one to con- clude that social scientists have been preoccupied with the problems of the family in industrial socie- ty. Thus, journals are replete with studies of the causes and the consequences of divorce, single parenthood, remarriage, family violence, and premarital pregnancy, as well as less "public" problems of family dynamics such as the transi- tion to parenthood. While this emphasis may be defensible on both practical and humanitarian grounds, it has resulted in a dearth of research on more mundane and less controversial family rela- tionships. Given the high rates of pet ownership in this country, the lack of sociological data on pet- human bonds indicates that family social scien- tists have little insight into an aspect of family life that is shared by millions of Americans. The importance of pets in the contemporary urban American household is both obvious and perplexing. Americans spend over $5 billion an- nually feeding dogs and cats alone, while only $3 billion is spent on baby food (Beck, 1983; Pet Food Institute, 1986). Veterinary bills in the United States exceed $3.5 billion per year. Veterinarians estimate the lifelong cost of owning an 80-pound dog at $8,353, a 10-pound dog at $3,525, and a cat at $3,957. These figures are for city pets and include licensing, grooming, veterinary costs, and one-week boarding fees for the time the owner may take a trip somewhere that the pet cannot go (Connelly, 1982). Given the fact that one may own more than one pet over the life course, the expenses incurred in pet ownership are not insignificant. Pets do not make economic sense, particularly in the city. Perhaps 1 % of dogs guide the blind or guard homes, perhaps one cat in one hundred catches mice; but beyond these small fractions, pets do not do useful work, and they provide no profit despite the fact that they cost substantial amounts of money, require time, and often exact humiliating or onerous tasks from their owners. In short, pets are an economic paradox, par- ticularly when contrasted with human welfare needs. It is precisely this paradox that raises in- teresting sociological questions about the role of pets in the modern American household. In this article we explore the role of the pet as a source of affection and attachment in families and how this role is related to the social structure of the household. Data on the demographics of pet ownership are also presented as they relate to the roles and functions of pets over the life cycle. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE The research questions underlying our study are grounded in the concepts of family development theory (Aldous, 1978; Duvall and Miller, 1985). A basic tenet of the theory is that families are not fixed units. Rather, they are organizations that change in response to internal and external demands. There are a number of dimensions along which families might alter their structure and behavior, including power, communication, and affection. The family life cycle stages, as outlined by Duvall (Aldous, 1978; Duvall and Miller, 1985) are as follows: Stage 1: Establishment Stage (Newlyweds) Stage 2: Families with Infants Stage 3: Families with Preschool Children Stage 4: Families with School-Age Children Stage 5: Families with Teenagers Stage 6: Families with Young Adults Stage 7: Postparental Families (Empty Nest) Researchers have utilized family development theory to examine the interrelated roles and func- tions of human family members. It is our intent to assess the extent to which pets perform additional roles, and how such roles vary by a number of so- ciological variables, including stage in the family life cycle. In our view, family development theory is the appropriate theory for this analysis of pet-human relationships, since our purpose is to clarify the roles and functions of pets over the life cycle. The concept of a family life cycle is useful for delineat- ing reference points in explaining changes in fami- ly relationships due to the development and loss of statuses and roles. Further, the stages of the family life cycle are valid indicators of family structure, a concept that is imperative to understanding the roles that pets play in families. Thus, family development theory can be utilized to help us address the fundamental differences across family types (e.g., newlyweds versus 544</page><page sequence="3">Pets in Families families with infants) in terms of level of attach- ment to the family pet. One of the basic hypotheses of our study is that pets are viewed as family members in the ur- ban American household. As such, they are par- ticipants in the interaction structures of the family and they play significant social roles in regard to other family members. For example, as givers and receivers of affection, pets can contribute to the morale maintenance of the family. However, we contend that the importance of the pet as a source of affection and attachment is related to house- hold structure and changes over the life cycle. For example, we predict that attachment to pets is greatest in families where there is a limited number of significant others to function as sources of support and affection-families such as newlyweds, empty-nesters, and childless couples. In order to reflect the growing diversity of families and lifestyles in America, the unit of analysis employed in the study is the "household" as opposed to the "family." Thus, we examine pet attachment among families at various stages of the life cycle as well as among divorced and remarried people, childless and cohabitating couples, and widowed and never-married people who live alone. METHODS Our study of pets in the American household con- sisted of a telephone interview with 612 pet owners in Providence, Rhode Island, and Rice County, Minnesota. The pet owners were ob- tained from a systematic random sample of the telephone directory of each locale. The Rhode Island and Minnesota sites were selected in order to represent both urban and rural households in the sample. A "quota" sample of 251 nonowners of pets was also included in the study as a means of comparing owners and nonowners on a number of sociodemographic variables. This sam- ple was obtained by interviewing every fourth respondent who reported that they did not have a pet when contacted by the interviewer. A total of 863 households were surveyed. The interviews were conducted during the summer and fall of 1985. Quantitative data on approximately 250 variables were obtained in the telephone survey. The data included information regarding the at- titudinal and social interactional dimensions of pet-human relationships, as well as the history of pet ownership in the household. The demograph- ics of pet ownership were also assessed. The telephone interviews were designed to last approximately 25 minutes. However, given the proclivity of respondents to talk about their pets, it was not uncommon for an interview to last as long as 40 to 50 minutes. Thus, in addition to pro- viding an abundance of quantitative data, the telephone interviews also proved to be a rich source of qualitative data on the role of the pet in the American household. Interviews with non- owners took approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. The interview schedule for nonowners included many of the same sociodemographic questions asked of the pet-owning sample. Nonowners were also questioned about the fac- tors involved in their decisions not to own a pet. Given the diversity of lifestyles and work schedules in America, the telephone surveys were conducted between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m., seven days a week. The interviewers were housewives and graduate and undergraduate students with prior experience in survey research. The inter- views were conducted with the adult who was the most familiar with the history of pet ownership in the household. The refusal rate for the telephone survey was 23% in urban Rhode Island and 30% in rural Minnesota. In this article we focus on the urban data ob- tained in the telephone survey of 320 pet owners and 116 nonowners in Providence, Rhode Island. RESULTS The Demographics of Pet Ownership in the City Despite the inconvenience of pet ownership in the city, approximately 40% of the households sur- veyed in Providence, Rhode Island, have at least one pet, and multiple pet ownership is not uncom- mon. Almost half of the pet owners have more than one pet. Table 1 presents the number and type of pet per pet-owning household in the sam- ple. The most popular pets in the urban setting are the dogs, followed by cats. Sixty percent of the ur- ban pet owners have at least one dog and 52% have at least one cat. One dog is the norm in the urban household, whereas multiple cat ownership is more common among urban cat owners. Only 545</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Marriage and the Family TABLE 1.

For example, one respondent in the sample reported owning 45 birds, thus inflating the average number per household. 20% of dog owners in Providence have more than one dog. Thirty-six percent of the cat owners, on the other hand, report having two or more. Relatively fewer people have birds and fish, 10% and 8%, respectively. Fifteen percent of the respondents report that they have some other type of pet such as rabbits, snakes, or hamsters. These data are basically consistent with the findings of other researchers who have examined the demo- graphics of pet ownership in the United States (Frost and Sullivan, 1980). People who live in the city spend a significant amount of money each month maintaining their pets. In our urban sample, the average monthly expenditure per pet is $25. However, since many respondents have more than one pet, the average monthly expenditure for all pets is approximately $40. Forty percent of the nonowners of pets in Providence stated that there is someone in the household who wants a pet. The type of pet most commonly desired is a dog, and the member of the household most frequently mentioned as wanting a pet is the wife. Interestingly, wives are also most frequently mentioned as the member of the household who does not want a pet. This is probably due to the fact that, regardless of stage in the family life cycle, mothers and wives are the primary caregivers of the household pet and they are much more likely than husbands and children to be involved in the daily maintenance of the animal. The most frequent responses given by nonowners for not owning a pet are problems with housing, the inconvenience of pet ownership, and lifestyle restrictions (e.g., not home enough, travel, etc.). In order to identify the variables that best predict pet ownership in the city, we applied discriminate analysis (Klecka, 1980) to the data. In the analysis, pet owners and nonowners were treated as two distinct groups of people. The technique was then utilized to determine which variables best predict membership in the two groups. Thus, we were able to assess the variables that are most important in distinguishing pet owners from nonowners in our urban sample. The variables included in the analysis are marital status, number of children, number of children present in the home, stage in the family life cycle, age of oldest member in the household, education, income, home ownership, and type of residence. These variables were selected because other researchers have observed that they are im- portant predictors of pet ownership in the city (e.g., Beck, 1983; Salmon and Salmon, 1983; Covert, Whiren, Keith, and Nelson, 1985). Table 2 summarizes the results of the analysis. Only TABLE 2.

See Tabachnick and Fidell, 1983, for a discussion of this procedure. 546</page><page sequence="5">Pets in Families those variables that are significant in predicting pet ownership are presented. As can be seen in Table 2, marital status, number of children present in the home, stage in the family cycle, age, and income are related to pet ownership. The remarried respondents in our sample are more likely to be pet owners than nonowners, whereas, relative to other respon- dents, widows are less likely to own a pet. For ex- ample, approximately 20% of the nonowners in Providence are widowed as compared to 7.4%o who have pets. Pet owners do not have more children than nonowners do, but they are significantly more likely to have children present in the home. Fur- ther, stage in the family life cycle differentiates pet owners and nonowners. Pet ownership is high among families with grammar-school-age and teenage children. It is low among empty-nesters and families with infants. Although pet ownership is related to the presence of children in the urban household, families with very young children are less likely to have pets. The association of pet ownership with stage in the family life cycle is further observed through an examination of age and pet ownership. Pet own- ership is highest in households where the oldest member is between 30 and 49 years of age, again reflecting the greater likelihood for families in the "middle years" of the life cycle to be pet owners. Further, pet owners and nonowners differ by in- come. Low-income respondents (less than $8,000 per year) are less likely to have pets. Given the costs incurred in owning a pet, this finding is not surprising. These data on the effects of presence of children, stage in the family life cycle, and in- come on pet ownership are consistent with the findings of other studies (Beck, 1983; Covert et al., 1985; Purvis and Otto, 1976; Salmon and Salmon, 1983). Finally, with other variables controlled, level of education, home ownership, and type of resi- dence do not affect pet ownership in Providence, Rhode Island. Pets as Family Members Our study is predicated on the hypothesis that pets are viewed as family members in the urban American household. Respondents were asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, the extent to which their favorite pet is a member of the family. A score of 5 on the scale indicates that the pet is "very much" a family member, whereas a 1 reflects the opinion that the pet is "not at all" a member of the family. Responses to this question support our hypothesis. Eighty-seven percent of the urban pet owners rate the extent of their pet's membership in the family as either a 5 (48.8%) or a 4 (38.1%). Thus, we conclude that pets are viewed as family members by the vast majority of our urban re- spondents. Pet Attachment One of the primary interests of our study is to determine the psychological and emotional roles that pets play in the urban household and how these roles are related to family type. Twelve items were included in the telephone survey to measure feelings of intimacy, caring, and attachment to pets. These are the dimensions of loving relation- ships among humans as described by Rubin (1973).' Respondents were asked to rate the extent of their agreement or disagreement with each of the items on a scale of 1 to 5. Factor analysis and inter-item correlations of the data revealed that nine of the items assess an underlying dimension of people's feeling toward their pets. We define this dimension as pet attachment. The data in- dicate that the dimensions utilized to describe feelings of loving among humans might also be somewhat applicable to pet-human relationships. These items are: 1. I feel closer to (pet's name) than to many of my friends. 2. I like (pet's name) because he/she accepts me no matter what I do. 3. (Pet's name) makes me feel loved. 4. (Pet's name) gives me something to talk about with others. 5. I feel closer to (pet's name) than to other family members. 6. (Pet's name) keeps me from being lonely. 7. I like (pet's name) because he/she is more loyal than other people in my life. 8. (Pet's name) gives me something to take care of. 9. There are times when (pet's name) is my closest companion. From these data, we constructed a pet attach- ment scale by adding people's responses to each of the nine items. Scale scores ranged from 10 to 44, with a mean of 31.4. Cronbach's alpha for the pet attachment scale was .85. In order to examine the factors related to pet attachment in the city, we applied multiple 547</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Marriage and the Family classification analysis (MCA) to the data. Multi- ple classification analysis is a statistical technique that is similar to a multiple analysis of variance. The technique tests the significance of the dif- ference of means (of the dependent variables) for the various categories of an independent variable while controlling for the effects of other variables. A comparison of the deviation of the category mean from the grand mean indicates the direction of the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable. The variables included in the MCA analysis are marital status, stage in the family life cycle, number of children, presence of children, income, and type of pet. Five of the variables were found to affect attachment to pets. These data are pre- sented in Table 3. As can be seen in Table 3, never-married, divorced, and widowed people, as well as people who are involved in a second or subsequent mar- riage, score higher on pet attachment than do cohabitating couples and people who are in first marriages. People who do not have children and those who do not have children present in the home also feel closer to their pets. Further, pet at- tachment is related to number of children. People with two or more children and/or two or more children present in the home are less attached to pets than are people in one-child families. Pet attachment also varies by type of pet owned. Respondents who selected a dog as their favorite pet demonstrate greater feelings of pet at- tachment than do people whose favorite pets are cats or other types of pets.

Stage in the family life cycle is related to peo- ple's attitudes toward their pets. As can be seen in Table 3, pet attachment is high during the newly- wed and the empty-nest stage of the life cycle, as well as among never-married and widowed peo- ple. It is particularly low among families with in- fants. Throughout the preschool, school-age, teenage, and launching stages of the family life cy- cle, people demonstrate a low degree of attach- ment to their pets. The finding that families in the "middle stages" of the life cycle demonstrate lower levels of pet attachment is interesting since, as can be seen in Table 4, families with school-age and teenage children are most likely to acquire pets. The motivation for acquiring a pet during the "middle stages" of the family life cycle is, ap- parently, based in normative beliefs about the im- portance of pets for children. Respondents were asked to rate the extent of their agreement or disagreement with the statement, "Pets are im- portant to have when there are children in the family." Ninety-four percent of the pet owners in the sample either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement. Responses did not vary by stage in the family life cycle. Finally, income was found not to affect pet at- tachment among our urban respondents. Pet Anthropomorphism Factor analysis of the data also indicated that 10 of the items included in the interview assess a dimension of respondents' feelings toward their pets that is conceptually and empirically distinct from pet attachment. These items are presented in the Appendix.2 We label the dimension measured by the items as pet anthropomorphism, or (as defined in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary) "the tendency to attribute human or personality characteristics to things that are not human." A pet anthropomorphism scale was constructed by adding responses to all 10 items.3 Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .69.

These data are presented in Table 5. As can be seen, pet anthropomorphism is high among respondents who are involved in a second or subsequent marriage, are divorced, or were never married. Interestingly, although widows are highly attached to their pets, they are not par- ticularly prone to anthropomorphism. In results similar to those observed for pet attachment, pet anthropomorphism is low among people who are involved in a first marriage. Number of children is also related to pet an- thropomorphism. People with two or more chil- dren are less likely to attribute human qualities to their pets than are people who do not have children or who have only one child. As we found with previous data on attachment, pet anthropo- morphism is higher among respondents who selected a dog as their favorite pet as opposed to a cat or other type of pet. Stage in the family life cy- cle, presence of children, and income were not found to affect pet anthropomorphism in our ur- ban sample. DISCUSSION The findings of our study provide the basis for some interesting observations regarding the roles played by pets in America. First, pets tend to be viewed as family members by people who live in the city. As members of the family, pets play significant emotional and psychological roles in the urban household. Second, as expected on the basis of family development theory, pet ownership and the roles and functions of pets vary over the life cycle and by family type. The low rate of pet ownership among families with young children suggests that owning a pet may be incompatible with the needs of families at this stage of the family life cycle. The time-intensive process of caring for infants and preschool children may leave little time and energy for maintaining a pet. Thus, rather than being a source of affection and attachment for family members, a pet may be an additional stres- sor for couples experiencing the transition to par- enthood. This was evident in the home interviews with families at the infant stage of the family life cycle.4 Young mothers report that, since the ar- rival of the baby, they have little time for the family pet. In addition, young mothers express feelings of guilt about "neglecting" the pet and they reveal that the pet became less important in the family after the baby was born. Pet ownership is particularly high among families with grammar-school-age and teenage children. Yet, attachment to pets is relatively low during this period. The motivation for owning a pet among families at the "middle" stage of the life cycle is rooted in the belief that pets perform beneficial functions for children. Data obtained in the home interviews reveal that parents view the activities involved in caring for a pet as useful in teaching children desirable attributes such as in- dependence and responsibility. Parents also stress the companionship roles that pets play for chil- dren. The low rate of pet ownership among widowed and low-income people undoubtedly reflects the high cost of owning a pet. Further, housing restrictions and the desire for autonomy may limit the number of elderly widowed people who have pets. The finding that pets can be an important source of affection and attachment among di- vorced, never-married, and widowed people, childless couples, newlyweds, and empty-nesters indicates that pets can be emotional substitutes for family members such as children and spouses. As givers and receivers of affection, pets can con- tribute to the morale maintenance of people who live alone or with few significant others to play such roles. Pets are so important in the lives of some people that they are granted "human" status, as is evident in the high levels of an- thropomorphism among never-married and divorced people and childless couples. In com- parison to other types of pets, dogs are apparently the most adept at playing affectionate and emo- tionally supportive roles. Dogs may interact with their owners in a way that results in high levels of attachment. This may account for the continuing popularity of the dog as a pet, even in highly ur- banized areas. Serpell (1983) discusses the "per- sonality" characteristics of the dog that are par- ticularly conducive to the establishment of strong bonds between humans and pets. While it may not be immediately apparent, when integrated with other findings in the study, the high degree of pet attachment and anthropo- morphism observed among remarried people can also be interpreted within the framework of fami- ly development theory. Pets can be an important source of affection and support for people who 550</page><page sequence="9">Pets in Families experience critical life course transitions such as divorce, remarriage, widowhood, and the transi- tion to the empty nest. The stress related to the loss and/or addition of life course statuses and roles may make the affection provided by a pet in- valuable. Nowhere is this more apparent than among remarried people. A pet might be acquired during a first marriage and be present during a divorce, a transition to singlehood or single parenthood, and a remarriage. Given the fact that remarriage often involves the transition to stepparenthood, a pet may prove to be an impor- tant source of unconditional affection for people experiencing the difficulties of adjustment to a "blended" family.5 Third, the data also provide the basis for speculating about the role of the pet in the American household of the future. We find that pets are particularly important in the lives of never-married, divorced, remarried, and widowed people, childless couples, and empty-nesters. Given the demographic changes currently under way in America, it is precisely these social categories that are becoming a larger and larger segment of the population (Glick, 1984; Norton, 1983; Norton and Moorman, 1987; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1983, 1984, 1985). Thus, one might hypothesize that the pet will increasingly be an im- portant family member in the future American household. We encourage family scholars to pur- sue research on the roles and functions of pets over the life course. NOTES This research was funded by the Delta Society, Ren- ton, WA. Portions of this paper have been presented at the International Conference of the Delta Society, Boston, 1986. Special thanks to Joanne Mechling, research assistant, who assisted in the development of the scale of anthropomor- phism, and to George Helling. 1. See Rubin (1973) for the definitions of the dimen- sions of loving. 2. One of the items included in the anthropomorphism scale is also used to assess pet attachment. The item is "I like (pet's name) because he/she is more loyal than other people in my life." The item is related to both dimensions of people's attitudes toward their pets and was, therefore, included in both scales. The correlation between the anthropomorphism and attachment scales was .58 when the loyalty item was excluded from the analysis and .69 when it was included. Thus, although a relationship does exist between pet attachment and pet anthropomor- phism, in our view, they represent conceptually and empirically distinct dimensions of pet-human rela- tionships. 3. The z scores of the items were utilized to construct the anthropomorphism scale. 4. The second phase of the study entailed face-to-face interviews with members of 100 households selected from the telephone survey. The households were selected to represent the seven stages of the family life cycle. The home interviews consisted of open- ended questions designed to obtain qualitative data on pet-human relationships. Although they in- cluded questions related to topics covered in the telephone survey, the home interviews also explored more sensitive aspects of pet ownership that were not previously addressed, such as the grief experi- enced with the death of a pet. A home interview lasted approximately 2 hours. 5. Nine of the 40 remarried respondents in the sample acquired their pet(s) during a previous marriage; 7 obtained the pet(s) when they were divorced. Eigh- teen of the 26 remarried respondents who reported that there were children present in the home were living in "blended" families. REFERENCES Aldous, Joan. 1978.
