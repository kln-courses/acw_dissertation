<plain_text><page sequence="1">"VAGUE CAPRICIOUS MEMORIES": THE LIFTED VEIL'S CHALLENGE TO WORDSWORTH IAN POETICS by ANNE D. WALLACE University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg Although The Lifted Veil is still little-read, influential critical evaluations by Terry Eagleton, Gillian Beer, and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar offer us excellent points of access to this deeply pessimistic novella.1 Gilbert and Gubar, in particular, work to define the intersecting investigations of sexual and artistic identity that outline George Eliot's difficulties in being both woman and writer. All the extant treatments focus on Latimer's prescience and clairvoyance, and on the failures or dangers of his supernaturally enhanced perceptions. But Latimer has yet another mode of perception that lifts the veil of temporality, one commonly available to us all and one insistently identified as a crucial element of artistic vision during the nineteenth century: memory, the recollection and transformation of past experience. Most of Eliot's work appears to carry Wordsworth's assertion of recollection as the foundation of both poetiy and human community steadily forward in the popular imagination.2 Yet The Lifted Veil asserts not only the horrors of supernaturally acute perceptions of present and future, but the failure and delusions of memory as well. Through a narrator who aspires to be a Wordsworthian poet, a narrative which repeatedly calls attention to the failure of recollection in both life and art, and a structure which mimics the greater Romantic lyric but does not fulfill its expectations, The Lifted Veil runs explicitly counter to Wordsworthian poetics. Thus the novella constitutes a working-out of Eliot's artistic identity, not only in the terms already recognized by Gilbert and Gubar, but in terms of a direct and thorough contradiction of one of Eliot's "master voices." Since the novella is seldom read, let me summarize what are, for our discussion, its most salient points. The entire story is told in first person by the protagonist. Beginning with the words, 31</page><page sequence="2">Vague Capricious Memories "The time of my end approaches," Latimer vividly describes his vision of his own death, noting the day, the time, the servants' indifference, the pain and terror of helplessness, and his final experience of "passing on and on through the darkness," his thought moving endlessly onward without sensation or sight ( Lifted Veil 2). He then offers a memoir of his life from his childhood to the present, just a month before his death. Latimer describes a childhood happy only in its contrast to adulthood, lightened mostly by the memory of his mother's comforting love. While she still lives, he suffers an illness that temporarily blinds him; after her death he is subjected to a regimen of mechanical and scientific training designed to balance what his father perceives as an oversensitive nature. But Latimer remains much as he was, an older version of the boy thrown into "mingled trepidation and delicious excitement" by the echoes of hooves and voices and barking dogs in the resounding stable near his home (4-5). He regards himself as a poet in sensibility, aware of his surroundings to the point of agony, but lacking the crucial power of expression. Even after three years of education in Geneva, which he passes in "a perpetual sense of exultation, as if from a draught of delicious wine, at the presence of Nature in all her awful loveliness," he is unable to describe the scenes around him or express the emotions he experiences: A poet pours forth his song and believes in the listening ear and answering soul, to which his song will be floated sooner or later. But the poet's sensibility without his voice-the poet's sensibility that finds no vent but in silent tears on the sunny bank, when the noonday light sparkles on the water, or in an inward shudder at the sound of harsh human tones, the sight of a cold human eye-this dumb passion brings with it a fatal solitude of soul in the society of one's fellow men. (8-9) In this state of continuing isolation, Latimer falls ill again and, as he recovers, has the first of four fully recounted episodes of presentiment or prevision: a vision of Prague; a vision of his first meeting with Bertha, whom he will fall in love with and eventually marry; a vision of the moment when he realizes Bertha's hatred for 32</page><page sequence="3">Vague Capricious Memories him and the cold shallowness of her soul; and the vision of his own death. Each of these is a true vision, later confirmed by his actual experience. He also develops clairvoyance or, as he calls it, "insight" into others' minds, into what he calls the "naked, skinless complications" of human thought (21). The only one immune to his capacity is Bertha, who temporarily becomes his "oasis of mystery in the dreary desert of knowledge" (26). With the sharp desire of beings that can imagine omniscience but cannot attain it, we humans long for Latimer's visionary gifts daily, almost involuntarily: "if I had known then what I know now..." But Latimer's supernatural perceptions prove useless at best, curses at worst. His knowledge of the future does not enable him to avoid its sorrows; his knowledge of others only breeds contempt for the petty, disconnected consciousnesses that lie below the graceful drapery of social intercourse. Some of these incapacities and feelings, clearly, are due to Latimer's own natural passivity and misanthropy. But, the narrative asserts, the uselessness of vision derives mostly from the common human condition, one in which mystery and desire play an irreplaceable part. Here, in a voice that is unmistakably that of George Eliot teaching through her narrator's mouth, Latimer meditates on his inability to turn aside from the known horror of his future with Bertha: So absolute is our soul's need of something hidden and uncertain for the maintenance of that doubt and hope and effort which are the breath of its life, that if the whole future were laid bare to us beyond to-day, the interest of all mankind would be bent on the hours that lie between; we should pant after the uncertainties of our one morning and our one afternoon; we should rush fiercely to the Exchange for our last possibility of speculation, of success, of disappointment; we should have a glut of political prophets foretelling a crisis or a no-crisis within the only twenty-four hours left open to prophecy.... Our impulses, our spiritual activities, no more adjust themselves to the idea of their future nullity, than the beating of our heart, or the irritability of our muscles. (43-45) 33</page><page sequence="4">Vague Capricious Memories So it is with Latimer, who, in knowing terror, lives through his courtship, marriage, utter disillusionment, and, Anally, death. In a few closing sentences, he returns the reader to his opening vision, now (the open-ended construction implies) actually occurring: "It is the 20th of September 1850. I know these ßgures I have just written, as if they were a long familiar inscription. I have seen them on this page in my desk unnumbered times, when the scene of my dying struggle has opened upon me...." (66-67). Following and expanding upon the commentary of U.C. Knoepflmacher and Rudy Redinger, Gilber and Gubar detail the parallels between Latimer and Eliot herself.3 Their familial relations, defined by a dead angel-mother, a strong pragmatic father, and an irritatingly successful and conventional brother, place each in positions of emotional and economic dependence and inferiority. Both display an initial distrust of strangers; both dislike their bodies, which in each case deviate from the culture's sexual ideals, with the result that physical illness and weakness is an everyday affair. In each case, too, illness coincides with the onset of extraordinary visions which either promise or precede literary expression, and in each case that expression is deferred or denied (Gilbert and Gubar, 447-451). These parallels suggest, as Gilbert and Gubar indicate, that Latimer's case is in some ways Eliot's: given an artist's extraordinary vision, each is thwarted in the expression of that vision, Latimer by an unsuitable mind and temperament, Eliot by the external and internal constraints imposed by cultural representations of sexuality. In each case, in fact, the problem might be abstractly rendered as a conflict between apparent and experienced gender, the comparison enforced by Latimer's inverted mirroring of Eliot's "masculine" mind in an "unattractive" woman's body: he is technically male, but both his mental and his physical characteristics are traditionally "feminine." One of the primary issues of the Veil, then, is the interrogation of the conflicts between Eliot's gender and her artistry. Gilbert and Gubar also thoroughly explore how the image of the veil traditionally functions in male representations of woman as angel/monster, noting that "the recording of what exists behind the veil is distinctively female because it is the woman who exists behind the veil in patriarchal society, inhabiting a private sphere 34</page><page sequence="5">Vague Capricious Memories invisible to public view" (474). This image, clearly, is crucial to our understanding of Eliot's novella, particularly because it acts as a nexus for sexual and artistic identities. Without diminishing their emphasis, let me analyze "the veil" in a slightly different way. There are at least three veils (not unrelated to each other) which would, under normal circumstances, both isolate Latimer and shield him from the terrific and deadening vision that afflicts him: the veil of individuality, the veil of sexuality, and the veil of temporality. The first lifts for extended and agonizing periods of time, as Latimer is exposed to the thoughts of others. As we have already noted, the narrative asserts that Latimer's clairvoyance does little but give him pain; and since Latimer lacks or will not wield the power of poetic expression, his understanding remains entirely one- sided. Until he begins to write this last memoir, Latimer tells us, he has "never fully unbosomed myself to any human being" (2). The second veil, as his choice of terms here suggests, remains drawn despite sexually ambiguous characterizations that imply difficulty in drawing hard lines between the male and the female. Latimer's traditionally female sensitivity and intuition are unmixed with the masculine talent for artistic expression, and remain trapped in an "effeminately" weak, sickly, hysterical body which nonetheless is read as "male." He cannot, indeed, unbosom himself, not only because he cannot shed his passivity but because hć is not gendered female. His potential femininity and any possible advantage that might carry are short-circuited by the nominal appearance of masculinity, an appearance that causes people to expect rather different behavior from him. In one sense Latimer's very existence tears the veil between man and woman, but neither he nor anyone else is freed from their gender roles by that involuntary act. The last veil, that of temporality, is most clearly manifest as a veil of mortality, the "dark veil" of death (63). When this veil is drawn briefly aside, during the temporary resurrection of Mrs. Archer and in Latimer's vision of his own death, the results are once again active destruction or helpless pain: Mrs. Archer wakes only long enough to reveal Bertha's plan to poison Latimer, violently completing their growing disaffection and ending their married life together; and although Latimer sees his death, he can neither avoid 35</page><page sequence="6">Vague Capricious Memories it nor reconcile himself to it.4 Finally, the veil of death functions as the decisive limit to the narrative itself. Likewise, Latimer's foresight produces successful but inefficacious violations of the normal temporal bounds of knowledge. He does know the future, but often in unintelligible forms (as in his late visions of unknown places and persons), and can do nothing to alter even those aspects of the future he does fully comprehend. But memory provides a third way to lift the veil of temporality (in this case the veil of the past), one naturally available to people, and which should, in Wordsworthian doctrine, stimulate individual moral growth, artistic expression and human community. Wordsworthian poetics, in formulas as familiar to Eliot as they are to us, establish memory as the foundation of poetic expression. Since "all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings," a poet must be "possessed of more than usual organic sensibility" ("Preface to Lyrical Ballads [1802]" in Gill 598). But he must also have "thought long and deeply": For our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings; and, as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men, so by the repetition and continuance of this act, our feelings will be connected with important subjects, till at length, if we be originally possessed of much sensibility, such habits of mind will be produced that... we shall describe objects, and utter sentiments, of such a nature and in such connection with each other, that the understanding of the being to whom we address ourselves, if he be in a healthful state of association, must necessarily be in some degree enlightened, and his affections ameliorated. (598) Thus poetry "takes it origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity," the process of remembering the past experience gradually causing the disappearance of the present tranquillity and the production of "an emotion, kindred to that which was before the subject of contempIation...[which] does itself [that is, the kindred emotion] 36</page><page sequence="7">Vague Capricious Memories actually exist in the mind"(611). The substance and form of Wordsworth's poems overtly enforce his declared poetics, as even a brief review of some of the best-known poems ("Tintern Abbey," "Michael," "The Ruined Cottage," the Intimations Ode, "I Wandered Lonely," and so forth) quickly reveals. Narrative recollection of past emotion re-presents that emotion and its original context, claiming to produce not only poetry but the achievement of or potential for the enlargement of the individual consciousness and of human community. The most significant formal manifestation of Wordsworthian (and early Coleridgian) poetic is the development of the greater Romantic lyric, a form described to us by M.H. Abrams: [Greater Romantic lyrics] present a determinate speaker in a particularized, and usually a localized, outdoor setting, whom we overhear as he carries on, in a fluent vernacular which rises easily to a more formal speech, a sustained colloquy, sometimes with himself or with the outer scene, but more frequently with a silent human auditor, present or absent. The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied but integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem round upon itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation. (In Bloom 201) In The Lifted Veil, Eliot offers us a narrator who aspires to be a Wordsworthian poet, communicating to us in a form which replicates the subjective circularity of a greater Romantic lyric but which completes itself with no alteration in the narrator's mood or understanding. Latimer's hyper-sensitivity, his intense emotional reliance on nature, and (as we shall see) his deliberate attempts to become a poet by the specific mechanism of recollection mark him 37</page><page sequence="8">Vague Capricious Memories not just as a poet, as he calls himself, but as a Wordsworthianpoet Certain telling details of his life buttress the theoretical identification. In Geneva, he finds his greatest solace in rowing his boat out into the center of the lake: it seemed to me that the sky, and the glowing mountain- tops, and the wide blue water, surrounded me with a cherishing love such as no human face had shed on me since my mother's love had vanished out of my life. I used to do as Jean Jacques did-lie down in my boat and let it glide where it would while I looked up at the departing glow leaving one mountain-top after the other...Then, when the white summits were all sad and corpse-like, I had to push homeward, for I was under careful surveillance, and was allowed no late wanderings. (9) La timet* directly identifies his experience with Rousseau, an allusion explored in Hugh Witemeyer's 1979 article on "George Eliot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau." But at least two other echoes are present In another tale exploring gender and creativity, Victor Frankenstein floats in his boat on Lake Geneva, trying to find comfort in the peace of nature (an allusion Gilbert and Gubar miss, although they do connect the Veil with Frankenstein) (Shelley 195; Gilbert and Gubar 455-456). More to our present point, Latimer's experience also recalls the famous row-boat passage in Wordsworth's Prelude ; the lake surrounded with mountains, the movement from initial delight and liveliness to deathly sadness (though here rendered in more anthropomorphic terms) the sense of being watched and of being out of bounds all resonate with the boy- Wordsworth's account (1850 Prelude I.357-400).5 Notice, moreover, the date of Latimer's death, a date named in the second paragraph of the novella and repeated in its last paragraph: "the 20th of September 1850". Although the day and month seem random (the "20th" only mildly pointing to a possible "23rd"), the year is momentous-it is the year of Wordsworth's death, and of the publication of his master-work on the development of a poet's mind. Without context, one might dismiss this as an arbitrary choice. But this apparently slight link between Wordsworth and 38</page><page sequence="9">Vague Capricious Memories Latimer takes on substance in the context of the latter's obviously acceptance of Wordsworthian poetics and the failure of his attempt to practice them. For Latimer, in fact, remembering almost never resurrects past experiences or enables the renovation of human feeling and community, but instead obscures original perceptions and deadens feeling. The one exception is his memory of his mother and her love, an exception which may, by its very isolation, further substantiate Gilbert and Gubar's identification of Latimer and Eliot. At every other point the narrative's overt insistence falls on the inefficacy of memory. When Latimer gains the power of clairvoyance, he describes the horrors of seeing in other people's minds "all the struggling chaos of puerilities, meanness, vague, capricious memories and indolent makeshift thoughts, from which human words and deeds emerge like leaflets covering a fermenting heap" (19-20). Again, as Latimer strives to see what Bertha has been hiding in her cabinet (it is the poison with which she plans to kill him), he finds that memory obscures rather than preserves her experiences: "[t]he recollections of the past become contracted in the rapidity of thought till they sometimes bear hardly a more distinct resemblance to the external reality than the forms of an oriental alphabet to the objects that suggested them"(54). Not only does his insight reveal that memory, far from transforming present experience or preserving the past, drains the substance from what is remembered, but the terms of both metaphors suggest that verbal or written expressions based on recollection function either to obscure the truth, as in the deceptive leaflets covering the chaos of human minds, or to render them unintelligible, as in the translation of "reality" into an "Oriental alphabet"--actually a system of characters, completely illegible to Westerners used to an alphabet. Nor can his visions of the future grant power by means of his recollection of them. As Latimer relates his fascination with Bertha despite his knowledge of their future, he asks us to imagine "this double consciousness at work within me, flowing on like two parallel streams which never mingle their waters and blend into a common hue": "my visions, when once they had passed into memory, were mere ideas-pale shadows that beckoned in vain, while my hand was grasped by the living and the loved"(32). In every case, 39</page><page sequence="10">Vague Capricious Memories memory, this commonly human, canonically approved source of consciousness, knowledge and community functions to desubstantiate, to deaden, so that the veil of the past, too, remains unlifted. A particularly telling case of the failure of memory appears in Latimer's recounting of his first vision, in which he sees Prague as a city unrefreshed for ages by the dews of night, or the rushing rain-clouds; scorching the dusty, weary, time-eaten grandeur of a people doomed to live on in the stale repetition of memories...urged by no fear or hope, but compelled by their doom to be ever old and undying, to live on in the rigidity of habit, as they live on in perpetual mid-day, without the repose of night or the new birth of morning. (11-12) In part, no doubt, it is Latimer's pessimism that darkens this vision. But the agent which he perceives as the deadening force here is "the stale repetition of memories," the dead hand of a past that, in the process of recollection into the present, stifles new life. Immediately after this, hoping that his vision is "a picture that my newly liberated genius had painted in fiery haste, with the colors snatched from lazy memory," Latimer tries to perform an act of Wordsworthian recollection: "I stimulated my imagination with poetic memories, and strove to feel myself present in Venice, as I had felt myself present in Prague"(14). But this is a complete failure: Latimer can only recall, uncertainly, old engravings on his walls at home: "It was all prosaic effort, not rapt passivity." He continues to perform this experiment for some time, always watching and hoping for the flowering of his poetic gifts under the stimulus of deliberate recollection, and always disappointed. These overt narrative assertions of the failure of memory appear in a prose version of a poetic form designed to celebrate the power of recollection. The entirely first-person point-of-view, a most uncharacteristic choice for Eliot, has a plot-based explanation: Latimer has never before communicated his crucial experiences of prescience and clairvoyance to anyone, and so only he can tell his 40</page><page sequence="11">Vague Capricious Memories story and verify the truth of his visions. Formally, however, Eliot's choice follows the formula of the greater Romantic lyric, the speaker moved by a particular vision to recollection and expression. Latimer's narrative just a such a circular memoir, told in his own voice to the silent auditor, his readers, beginning with the vision of his death and ending with the death itself. Classically, the scene the narrator of a greater Romantic lyric contemplates at the beginning and end of his story should be "a localized, outdoor setting," so that the impressions of natural forms give rise to recollection. In this The Lifted Veil appears to deviate from our expectations. But I would argue that Latimer does contemplate a "landscape" here, the landscape of the mind. To think in such terms is, after all, most Wordsworthian: the whole point of contemplating a natural scene is not to explore that scene (although that is an analogous process to what follows) but to explore the landscape as it is remembered, the landscape in the mind and the "landscape" of the mind. In "Tintern Abbey," for instance, the outdoor scene appears only briefly at the beginning of the poem, with the narrator then turning to descriptions of his own feelings as they are elicited by the landscape remembered, thus entering into a wholly psychological process. Latimer's account moves directly to that interior scene which is the primary concern of the greater Romantic lyric. That Eliot's narrator thought in these terms, conceiving of mind as landscape, is signaled by his comments on the moment when Bertha's hatred and shallowness are revealed to him: I saw myself in Bertha's thought as she lifted her cutting grey eyes, and looked at me: a miserable ghost-seer, surrounded by phantoms in the noon-day, trembling under a breeze when the leaves were still, without appetite for the common objects of human desire, but pining after the moonbeams...The terrible moment of complete illumination had come to me, and I saw that the darkness had hidden no landscape from me, but only a blank prosaic wall: from that evening forth, through the sickening years which followed, I saw all round the narrow room of this woman's soul...(48- 49) 41</page><page sequence="12">Vague Capricious Memories Not only does Bertha envision Latimer as a figure in a landscape, imagining his deficient psychology in terms of natural forms, but Latimer figures his expectation of Bertha's mind as an exterior, natural landscape, full and poetic and offering continued opportunities for exploration, only to discover a narrow interior scene bounded by "blank prosaic walls." With the mind or character understood as landscape, then, only two things are missing from this greater Romantic lyric: its "altered mood and deepened understanding," the quickening of moral sense in narrator and (by implication) reader, and the achievement of the poetry (as opposed to prose) which might bring this about. Although the form is fulfilled, the expectations set up, there is no transformation, no learning or shift, no renewal of the individual or of human community, and there is no elevation from the common understandings of prose into the sympathetic feeling of poetry. Despite memory, despite the representation of the past, all remains as Latimer first envisions it, bounded absolutely by the death or the individual consciousness. There are many reasons for the increasing distrust of memory as an artistic and spiritual source in the Victorian period, most importantly the increasingly obvious permanence of the loss of agrarian life and values to industrialization, and that never lifting, always accelerating sensation of inevitable change. To look back in one's search for stable values becomes irrelevant, as the past itself becomes a series of changes. But for George Eliot, in particular, the search for value and verification in memory is dreadfully problematic. When a woman writer seeks her grounding in tradition, where will she find it? The influence of the Brontes and Mary Shelley, as Gilbert and Gubar demonstrate, is palpable. But when Eliot consciously thinks about her antecedents, she must of necessity think mostly of men~of Shakespeare, of Milton, of Goethe, and most of all, of Wordsworth. One remembers her continual rereading of Wordsworth, and her comment to John Blackwood that she wonders that anyone other than herself will be interested to read Silas Marner "since William Wordsworth is dead" (Haight 258). At this crucial moment, in the midst of writing her second novel and faced with increasing demands for the public revelation of her identity, Eliot must have felt the extreme pressure 42</page><page sequence="13">Vague Capricious Memories of Wordsworth's valorization of the past-which now included the traditions of his own writing--and needed a means by which to question its demands, even if she Anally chose to accept them. I suggest, then, that The Lifted Veil not only investigates the common conflict between artist and woman, but confronts Wordsworth, Eliot's own master voice, and denies the fundamental premise of his power.

Thomas Pinney's unpublished dissertation, Wordsworth's Influence on George Eliot (Yale, 1960), is the place to look for a full- scale discussion of Wordsworth and Eliot. Pinney's essay on "The Authority of the Past in George Eliot's Novels" traces the connections among sympathy and memory in Eliot, through Wordsworth's connection between nature and memory, into the connection both develop between memory and piety. Commenting on Eliot's debt to Wordsworthian theories of recollection, Pinney notes that "[i]n her characters, an active and untroubled memory is the infallible sign of moral health" (47). George Eliot: A Collection of Critical Essays ed. George R. Creeger (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Ine, 1970), 37-54. My intention is not to dispute Pinney's demonstration that this aspect of Wordsworth's influence extends throughout Eliot's career, but to reveal The Lifted Veil as an exploratory challenge of a poetics that Eliot consistently practiced but, in this case, thoroughty questions. Margaret Homans offers a related inquiry in"Eliot, Wordsworth, and the Scenes of the Sisters' Instruction," reading The Mill on the Floss as an example of the "[tjension between [Eliot's] need to respect and the need to deny a powerful influence," which she believes is "representative of the attitude toward Wordsworth expressed later on in Eliot's works" (54).

Finally, on the question of memory, Charles Swann remarks that the Veil "investigates and challenges two of her dearest values: sympathy and memory", but looks to the replacement of memory with prevision and does not discuss Wordsworth's possible role in this business.
