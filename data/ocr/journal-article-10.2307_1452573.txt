<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOURCES OF THE TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM By LOUIS FINKELSTEIN Jewish Theological Seminary of America THE tannaitic Midrashim are, as is well known, com- pilations of comments by the early talmudic authorities, on the last four books of the Pentateuch. The latest author- ities mentioned in these works are the disciples of R. Judah the Patriarch, that is, scholars who lived before the middle of the third century C. E. It is therefore taken for granted that these works were compiled about that date, although there is evidence that they were not put into writing for several hundred years later, probably not before the sixth century.2 The material contained in these Midrashim is naturally of the greatest importance for a study of the history of Jewish law, literature and theology. They supplement the information we obtain from the Mishna, the Tosefta, and the tannaitic statements in the Talmud; they frequently cast an entirely new light on difficult, otherwise inexplica- ble, problems of the political and literary history of the Jews. And above all, because of the fact that they have come down to us in two groups, the one deriving from the school of R. Akiba, the other from the opposing school of R. T Among them were, for instance, R. Hanina (e. g. Mekilta, Bo, chap. 2, H-R, p. 8, Laut. I, p. 21; Beshallah, chap. 1, Horowitz-Rabin, p. 90; Laut. I, p. 202; R. Abba, (doubtless identical with Rab who founded the Babylonian academy of Sura (e. g., Mekilta, Vayyassa, chap. 1, H-R 154, Laut. II, p. 88). 2 See Ch. Albeck's distinguished work, Untersuchungen ueber die halakischen Midraschim, p. 119. 211</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Ishmael,3 they offer us an unparalleled opportunity to understand the differences between the opposing schools of early Rabbis, whose work was fundamental to all later rabbinic studies. Originally there were, apparently, eight such Mid- rashim:4 one from each school for every one of the last four books of the Pentateuch. In the course of time, however, four of the original works disappeared from the European codices,s so that we now possess in full only four tannaitic Midrashim, two from the school of R. Akiba, and two from the school of R. Ishmael. Fragments of the others have been recovered from the Genizah, and also from the citations by old authorities.6 The Midrashim, arranged according to their schools, are as follows (an asterisk marks those which have been preserved only in fragmentary form): 3 D. Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die halachischen Midraschim, pp. 5 ff. Cf. also Albeck, Untersuchungen, p. 44. 4 There may be some doubt as to whether there ever was a complete Midrash on Leviticus from the school of R. Ishmael, reduced to written form. Probably, there was from the beginning a confluence of the Midrashim of the two schools, with relation to this book. s For a description of the codices of the Mekilta which are of European origin, see Proc. Am. Acad. Jew. Research, V (1933-1934), p. 6, note 4, and p. 49. Regarding the texts of the Sifre, see ibid., III (1931-1932), pp. 4 ff. and 18 f. To these must now be added, of course, Ms. Sassoon 598 which contains an anonymous commentary on the Sifre. From the part of the Ms. which I have examined, I infer that its readings belong to the Italian group. 6 Texts of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Yohai were published by Schechter in JQR, N.S., XVI (1904), pp. 443-445; and included by D. Hoffmann in his edition, together with the citations gathered from the Midrash ha-Gadol; additional material was published by me in Studies in Memory of George Alexander Kohut, Hebrew section, pp. 102- 120. Texts of the Sifre Zuta were published by Schechter in JQR, VI (1894), pp. 657-663, and reprinted in Horovitz's edition, pp. 330-334; a larger additional text was published by J. N. Epstein in Tarbiz, I, 1, (1930), pp. 57-77. Texts of the Mekilta on Deuteronomy were published by Schechter in JQR, XVI (1904), pp. 446-452 and pp. 695-697, and included by D. Hoffmann in his Midrash Tannaim. 212</page><page sequence="3">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 213 School of R. Akiba School of R. Ishmael On Exodus Mekilta of R. Simeon* Mekilta of R. Ishmael On Leviticus Sifra (or Torat Kohanim) Mekilta on Leviticus* On Numbers Sifre Zuta* Sifre On Deuteronomy Sifre Mekilta* It can hardly be accidental that the Midrashim preserved in the European codices were drawn alternately from the opposing schools. Clearly the authority selecting the works for the various European academies considered him- self bound to give equal representation to each group. The Genizah Mss., which represent the tradition of Egypt, indicate that in that country all the Midrashim were known.7 But the Midrash ha-Gadol, a Yemenite compilation made in the fifteenth century, cites only the Midrashim of the school of R. Akiba for Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, though it quotes both the Sifre and the Mekilta on Deuteronomy. No complete explanation has yet been offered for these differences. But apparently the Egyptian schools were able to obtain from Palestine codices of Midrashim which were not available, at least in their complete form, to the European academies. The recovery of the Genizah Mss. and their study has now made it possible to obtain a much clearer picture of the origin and the development of the Midrashim than was possible in the days of Friedmann, Israel Lewy, David Hoffmann, the pioneers in this branch of modern rabbinic studies.8 To the information gleaned from these entirely 7 The Mekilta on Leviticus, as indicated above, note 4, apparently formed an exception. 8 Cf. the works of Friedmann, already cited, and in addition his introductions to the eds. of the Mekilta and the Sifre; Israel Lewy, Ein Wort ueber die "Mechilta des R. Simon" (Breslau, 1889); and D. Hoff- mann, Zur Einleitung in die halachischen Midraschim, (Berlin, 1886-87); and his eds. of the Mekilta of R. Simeon and Midrash Tannaimn. A beginning toward an analysis of the sources used in the Midrashim has been made by Albeck in his Untersuchungen, pp. 140 ff.; but, of course, much more remains to be done.</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW new sources, must be added that made available by a more careful examination of the various codices of the complete Midrashim extant in various European libraries. A study of this material has led me to the following conclusions: 1. It is an error to regard the various tannaitic Mid- rashim as units. On the contrary, they are composed of different compilations which were brought together in some instances rather arbitrarily. The classification of the works, into those of the school of R. Ishmael and R. Akiba, applies in general only to the halakic portions. The aggadic portions of a Midrash of one school are sometimes derived from a compilation made by the opposing group.9 2. Some of the compilations, especially the aggadic ones, were definitely put into written form before they were included in the present works. 3. The different compilations, constituting a Midrash, need not necessarily be of the same age. Indeed, it can be shown that one compilation is quoted, as a finished work, in another. I. EVIDENCE THAT THE VARIOUS TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM ARE BUILT OF SEPARATE COMPILATIONS WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY INDEPENDENT The fact that different parts of the various tannaitic Midrashim were originally separate compilations appears so obvious on a close examination of the material, that it is surprising that it was so long overlooked. The authorities treat the aggadic sections of the Mekilta of R. Ishmael (covering Exodus 13.17-20.26, i. e., the weekly portions 9 This has been noticed in part by Horovitz in his Introduction to his edition of the Sifre (p. XI), but he has failed to draw the necessary inferences. 214</page><page sequence="5">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 215 Beshallah and Jethro) as an integral part of that work.Io They simply ignore the fact that this portion of the Mekilta of R. Ishmael occurs, with minor textual variations, almost verbatim in the parallel Mekilta of R. Simeon. There is no more reason for the assumption that the compiler of the Mekilta of R. Simeon would simply borrow a large section of the parallel Midrash of the school of R. Ishmael, than for the opposite assumption. And it is equally possible to suppose that both Midrashim have reproduced this material from an older source. Nevertheless, all the discussions have proceeded on the theory that the passage properly belongs to the school of R. Ishmael."I Actually it turns out that the aggadic work was origi- nally a separate treatise which was borrowed by the com- pilers of the Mekilta of R. Ishmael and of the Mekilta of R. Simeon. Indeed, it can be shown, that the aggadic treatise itself consists of several parts which had been composed separately before they were brought together in their present connection.J2 lo Thus Hoffmann in his Einleitung, p. 42, especially enumerates the numerous Baraitot in aggadic Midrash I which corresponds to those quoted in other works as Baraitot of R. Simeon. He appears to con- sider it somewhat strange that statements of R. Simeon should be cited anonymously in this work, though if aggadic Midrash I is inde- pendent from the school of R. Ishmael it is not in the least remarkable. Similarly, Albeck, Untersuchungen, p. 134, treats aggadic Midrash I as though it were part of the Mekilta, instead of being an independent work. " Albeck, Untersuchungen, pp. 82-84, remarks that the Mekilta of Miluim in Sifra (ed. Weiss, 40d-46b) is not really a part of the Sifra, and that Sifre Deut. 31-54 is similarly not an original part of Sifre. He infers this from the terminology used in those passages. He does not, however, take account of the general differences between the aggadic and halakic passages in the various Midrashim. 12 Albeck goes too far when he proposes, on the basis of the differences between the origin of the aggadic sections of the Midrashim, as well as the interpolations, to reject the thesis developed by Friedmann and Hoffmann that our Midrashim derive from two schools, and that we can definitely assign one group to the school of R. Ishmael and another</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Some proof, that the main aggadic section (aggadic Midrash I) of the Mekilta of R. Ishmael was originally an independent work, has already been adduced elsewhere.13 Here it is necessary to draw attention further to the following facts. One part of aggadic Midrash I, that cover- ing the beginning of Beshallah, is actually quoted twice in Mekilta Bo, as though it were an older work. Thus we read in Mekilta Bo,I4 chapter 14, H-R, p. 48, Laut. I, p. 108: "(An d (r, hildre n of Israel journeyd from n ameses to 1 D 1 COKNW olpvD RhN nlmlllD r C-ID1i DIV= l ity,iK n3 lpD Dnap ?n ('l ,1"4 ~37n?) anb&gt;3 lzn1^ nlmmDo n1:1D 1:K nD1K K:3pp ^ni .DpD n1:1D P\ Succoth.)

The word Succoth here means literally booths, as it is written, 'And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, [and built him a house, and made (succoth) booths for his cattle] to the school of R. Akiba (Untersuchungen, p. 84). It is clear that the aggadic material derives from the combination of several sources, but as we shall see, there are instances where we can indicate in general the background of the scholars who compiled it; and we can also sepa- rate the additions and interpolations in the halakic sections from the remainder of the work. When this is done, it becomes clear that Fried- mann's and Hoffmann's thesis must be accepted. The validity of their argument becomes the more clear when we have available the Ms. texts of the fragmlent-Midrashim, like the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Yohai, (found in the Genizah) rather than the frequently corrupted and altered form cited in the Midrash ha-Gadol. 3 Proc. Am. Acad. Jew. Research, VI (1934-1935), pp. 206 ff. I4 Albeck's failure to notice that this passage is actually quoted from aggadic Midrash I led him into a complicated reconstruction of the whole text and its relation to the Sifra (see Untersuchungen, pp. 37 ff.). 216</page><page sequence="7">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 217 (Gen. 33.17).' This is the view of R. Eliezer. But the Sages say, The word Succoth can only signify a locality, as it is said, 'And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham (Ex. 14.20; Num. 33.6).' Just as Etham signifies a locality, so Succoth must signify a locality. R. Akiba, however, says, Succoth can only refer to the Clouds of Glory, as it is said, 'And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud of smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy (Isaiah 4.5).' Whence do we know that the Clouds of Glory will appear in the future even as they did in the past, because the verse continues, 'And there shall be a succah (pavilion) for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain (Isaiah 4.6),' and it is further said, 'And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads (Isaiah 35.10).'" Curiously the whole passage which is spaced in the Hebrew text, and beginning in the translation with "And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham," occurs verbatim in aggadic Midrash I (Mekilta Beshallah, proemium, H-R, p. 80, Laut. I, p. 182; cf. Mekilta of R. Simeon, 14.20, p. 40). But there the interpretation, "Just as Etham signifies a locality, so Succoth signifies a locality," is given anonymously. In Mekilta Bo, it is introduced, as we have seen, as a remark of "the Sages." The reason for this seems to be that the compiler of Mekilta Bo, finding the statement given anonymously in his source, attributed it, in accordance with general rabbinic practice, to "the Sages." But this means that the compiler of Mekilta Bo is actually quoting aggadic Midrash I, where the state- ment actually occurs anonymously.</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The close relationship of the two passages is demon- strated by a consideration of the other parallels to them. The statement that Succoth means "booths" was made by R. Eliezer, as can be seen from Sifra, Emor, per. 17.11, Weiss, 103b, not in connection with Exodus 12.37, "And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth," where obviously the meaning "booths" cannot possibly fit. It was made rather in connection with the verse, Lev. 23.43, "That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths (ba-succoth) when I brought them out of the land of Egypt." R. Akiba on the other hand maintains that the booths referred to in that verse were not tents, but Clouds of Glory. The Talmud, Sukkah 1 b, confirms this, citing the Baraita in precisely the form in which it is found in Sifra, but merely reversing the authorities, ascribing the view of R. Akiba to R. Eliezer, and that of R. Eliezer to R. Akiba. The anonymous authority cited in aggadic Midrash I, and holding that the word Succoth in Ex. 13.20, signifies a locality, obviously follows R. Eliezer, in taking the verses of the Scripture literally. The view expressed by R. Akiba elsewhere that Succoth means Clouds of Glory is simply transferred to this passage by the compiler, though it is far less likely that R. Akiba actually offered that farfetched interpretation to this verse, where Succoth so clearly means a locality. The compiler of Mekilta Bo took over the discussion between the anonymous authority and R. Akiba regarding Ex. 13.20. He then added the statement by R. Eliezer in connection with Lev. 23.43, although that statement can- not possibly have any meaning with reference to Ex. 13.20. The second quotation of aggadic Midrash I in Mekilta Bo occurs in the following passage (Mekilta Bo, chap. 12, H-R 41, Laut. 1, 94). 218</page><page sequence="9">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 219 yv nly r i W' lrwvl rivn m w nr m-1r 3n Zm D 8 1m ' 'n 1 rmm KntW' 1nwnnz DM D miawa C PnIDIN ^ rnwnr r-rny rnlnn 7nDW mp'l ' DmW Dnr :=: =1m n D: nmlN D''rny lnv ny rimnnm S"An it shal l nncow to pass, wn hlnnw ur childrn sall say unto yu ( 12 a n wa gv ner N o n ie n n Isr at that timenamely, that in the end the Torah wouldn be forgote nt some sy tht a good eiction was ('i ,I"D enptn) 't1a i nnm that nrti nm n (' pepl nibo) IYIthe hd ad w hipd (ibid. 12 .'

But some say, that a good prediction was given Israel at that time -namely, that they were destined to see children and grandchildren, as it is said, 'And the people bowed the head and worshiped (ibid. 12.27).' Wihy did they worship? Because it is said, 'And the children of Israel went up in fifths out of the land of Egypt (ibid. 14.18).' This means one out of five. But some say, it means one out of fifty. And others say, it means one out of five hundred went up (out of Egypt). R. Nehorai says, 'By the Temple service, not even one out of five hundred went up (out of Egypt),' as it is said, 'I caused thee to increase as the growth of the field (Ezek. 16.7),' and it is written, 'And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceed- ingly mighty. (Ex. 1.7).' This verse means that one woman would give birth to six children at one time; and yet you say that (only) one out of five hundred went up</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW (out of Egypt). And when did the others die? During the three days of darkness, as it is said, 'They saw not one another (Ex. 10.23).' And they were grateful and praised God that' their enemies did not see and rejoice in their affliction." Now the whole passage which is spaced in the Hebrew text, and in the translation covers the part beginning with "And the children of Israel went up in fifths," occurs ver- batim in the first part of aggadic Midrash I (Mekilta Beshallah, proemium, H-R, 77, Laut. 174). There can be no doubt that aggadic Midrash I is the source, and that the citation in Mekilta Bo is a quotation from it, for the verse on which the explanation depends is Exodus 13.18, a part of the text covered by aggadic Midrash I. Perhaps even more important than these quotations of aggadic Midrash I in Mekilta Bo are the contradictions between the two works. According to aggadic Midrash I (Mekilta Beshallah, Vayyehi, chap. 2, H-R 95, line 10, Laut. I, 213, line 118), the Israelites were forbidden to return to Egypt. On the other hand, Mekilta Bo (chap. 1, H-R 41, line 4, Laut. I, 93, line 1) agrees with Sifre Deut. (158, Fr. 105b, Fi. 210, line 1), in holding that the state- ment that Israel would not be brought back to Egypt was not a commandment, but merely a promise.I5 's Tcargum Yerushalmi Ex. 14.13 apparently agrees with the view that the statement of Scripture is a promise that Israel will not return to Egypt. On the other hand, Yer. Sanhedrin 10.9, 29d, reads: nn'w,' rynn nr W::iz,i 'Dpin3 mni rnni -inn inin nni 1' "Thou mayest not return (to Egypt) to dwell therein; but thou mayest return for husiness, for trade, and to acquire the land." The last phrase, which seems so curious, must probably be interpreted in connection with the statement preserved in Mekilta Beshallah, chap. 2, H-R p. 95, Laut. I, p. 213, Mek. R.S. 14.13, p. 47; and cited also in Yer. Sukkah 5.1, 55b, that "On three occasions the Holy One, blessed be He, warned the people of Israel not to return to Egypt ... and on each occasion they returned, and on each occasion they fell. 220</page><page sequence="11">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 221 Again, aggadic Midrash I follows the Shammaites in holding that the heavens were created before the earth (Mekilta Beshallah, Vayyehi, chap. 8, H-R 144, line 1, Laut. II, 64, line 69, Mek. R.S. 15.11, p. 67); whereas Mekilta Bo, proemium, (H-R, 1, line 13, Laut. I, 2, line 19) maintains that the heavens and the earth were created together. Further evidence that our present tannaitic Midrashim consist of various compilations which were combined after they had been put into writing is to be found in an exami- nation of several interesting notes in the present Mss. and editions of Sifre Numbers and Sifre Deuteronomy. At the end of Sifre Numbers, 122 (Fr. 41b, Horowitz 150), we find the statement: mnn"in n'"t' 1 t Ic p, D "This is the end of the book, Vayedabber, 314 Baraitot."'6 The book Vayyedabber can only mean the Book of Num- bers which begins with the word lT31l; and accordingly we must assume that the copyist who originally wrote this note considered the Sifre on Numbers ended at this point. At the very end of our present Sifre Numbers, i. e., after section 161, Fr. 63a, Horovitz 223, we find again the state- The first occasion was during the time of Sennacherib .. .the second during the time of Johanan ben Kareah . . .and the third in the time of Trajan." The reference to a return of Israel to Egypt under Trajan can only refer to the revolt against Rome led by Julianus and Pappus, toward the end of Trajan's principate. This war, as is well known, had its repercussions in Palestine, where Quietus was sent by Trajan to pacify the country. We have no reference to any resistance to Rome in Palestine itself; but as can be seen from this quotation, the Palestinian Jews did take part, in considerable numbers, in the Egyptian revolt (see further with regard to this the discussion of the history of the revolt, in Akiba, pp. 221 ff. and in Studies in Memory of Linda Miller, ed. I. Davidson, pp. 29 ff.). I6 The reading of Ms. Berlin, which was not available when Horovitz prepared his edition, is: nnrwi nr"tv ,n:m'n - p'D.

A similar reference to a part of a tannaitic Midrash as a complete work in itself is found in Sifre Deuteronomy 317, Fr. 136a, where the copyist notes that the passage he found in the text before him, and which he omits, is already to be found in an earlier passage in Sifre Deuteronomy, namely section 43, Fr. 80b, Fi. 92. But he refers to that passage not as part of the Sifre, but as m,ninni rtN. His note reads: D'"niimn mrm' Nn,, ;rnl1 "The whole Baraita (is) in Eleh ha-Debarim." The copyist then did not con- sider the work he was writing part of Eleh ha-Debarim, or the Sifre on Deuteronomy. He considered his a separate work, which had simply been attached to the Sifre on Deuteronomy. The implication of these copyists' notes is confirmed by the evidence of the structure of the Midrashim. I have already indicated elsewhere'8 that the aggadic section of Sifre Numbers (82-98) which is practically identical with Sifre Zuta, Numbers 10.33-11.35 (aggadic Midrash II) is an outgrowth of a Midrash of R. Simeon ben Yohai. As R. Simeon ben Yohai was a member of the school of R. Akiba, it is indeed surprising to find a work deriving from him in the Midrash of the opposing school of R. Ishmael, as the Sifre on Numbers is. The inclusion of this text can only have been made to "fill out," as it were, a '7 The variant readings for this passage are as follows: Ed. pr. p'~D mnn"in '" lp Im ["'Int nD' nr; mIzn Il i~] ''D iMrnD-: DiD rn; Ms. Berlin ;ns"in: 1'"p N-ID p'iDi Nnvi3 p'D; Ms. Oxford sn,,-3 l"ip nw i3D p,D; Ms. Vatican nl' -IDD 1p,D; Ms. Br.

But I have also pre- sented evidence to show that aggadic Midrash II had been put into writing (in an abbreviated form, to be sure, but nevertheless written down) before it was incorporated into either the Sifre of the school of R. Ishmael or the Sifre Zuta of the school of R. Akiba on Numbers. The fact that aggadic Midrash II is found in both works thus con- firms the suggestion that various parts of the tannaitic Midrashim, forming units in themselves, were simply added by copyists into the present texts. II. THE COMPOSITION OF AGGADIC MIDRASH I Aggadic Midrash I itself consists of various compilations which have simply been put together into a single unit. This can be seen by comparing the styles of the various sections. The most obviously distinct unit consists of Mekilta Vayyassa and Amalek, (covering Ex. 15.22-18.27 and corresponding to Mekilta of R. Simeon 15.22-18.27). This section of aggadic Midrash I is characterized by a series of comments on the various verses, each reporting the views of R. Joshua, R. Eliezer ben Hyrkanos, and R. Eleazar of M odin. The same order is retained through- out the compilation, although elsewhere in tannaitic litera- ture it is customary to mention the views of R. Eliezer before those of R. Joshua.'9 The second unit is Masseket Shirah, containing the com- ments on the Song of Moses (Ex. 15.1-21). There are a number of characteristic phrases and remarks, which occur repeatedly in this brief treatise, and never, or rarely, outside of it, showing that it is a stylistic unit. Thus in 19 Indeed this is done in aggadic Midrash I, itself, at the very mention of a controversy between R. Eliezer and R. Joshua (Mekilta Beshallah, Proemium, H-R 77, line 6, Laut. I, p. 173, line 59).</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW chap. 1, (H-R, 117, line 6, Laut.

Regarding the interpreta- tion of the passage, see Appendix, below. 226</page><page sequence="17">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 227 It is to be noted that in these sayings, R. Judah the Patriarch is cited as usual, under the title, Rabbi, and not with the singular title, "our holy Master." While it is true that the expression twvnpn lir may simply have been taken over from the source from which both stories were drawn, it nevertheless is characteristic of this section of aggadic Midrash I, that it utilized the collection to this extent, and that it retained the expression. R. Judah the Patriarch is, however, cited as rnrn u,=n "our great teacher" by his disciple, R. Abba,21 in Mekilta Beshallah, Vayyassa, chap. 1, H-R, 154, line 5, Laut. II, 202, line 206; Mek. R. S. 15.22, 72, line 12. Twice the section Shirah contains the thought that a person's remarks may contain unconscious prophecy (Mekilta, Beshallah, Shirah, chap. 7, H-R, 140, line 1, Laut. II, 55, line 27; Mek. R. S. 15.9, 65, line 5; and Mekilta, ibid. chap. 10, H-R, 149, line 5, Laut. II, 76, line 127; Mek. R. S. 15.17, 69, line 23). The thought occurs also in Mekilta Beshallah, Vayyehi, chap. 1, H-R. 85, line 1, Laut. I, 191, line 2; Mek. R. S. 14.3, 41, line 27, probably under the influence of Masseket Shirah. The third independent section is Masseket Vayyehi which, as we have already shown, is the only portion of aggadic Midrash I actually cited in Mekilta Bo; and the fourth section is Masseket Bahodesh, containing the Midrash on the Ten Commandments. This section is partly halakic, and is not properly to be considered part of aggadic Mid- rash I. It has the characteristic terminology of the school of R. Ishmael; it cites mainly authorities of that school; and it is lacking in Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Yohai. 21 As the commentators have noted, this R. Abba is identical with the famous Rab, the founder of the academy of Sura.</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW We may thus identify the following definite compilations within the present framework of our present aggadic Mid- rash I: (a) Proemium to Mekilta Beshallah (apparently consid- erably older, at least in its original form, than the remainder). (b) Mekilta Beshallah, chapters 1-2, (perhaps to be associated with Masseket Shirah). (c) Mekilta Beshallah, chapter 3 (a collection of homi- letical remarks regarding the Exodus, some of them in the names of authorities which otherwise occur rarely, or not at all, including particularly interesting references to Shemayah and Abtalyon, authorities of the first century B. C. E.). (d) Masseket Beshallah, chapters 4, 5, and 6. Char- acterized by more frequent references to R. Meir and R. Judah than occur in other parts of aggadic Midrash I. (e) Masseket Shirah. (f) Massektot Vayyassa and Amalek. (g) Masseket Bahodesh, chapters 1-5. (h) Masseket Bahodesh, chapters 6-8 (not properly part of aggadic Midrash I, being rather a Midrash of the school of R. Ishmael on the Ten Commandments).22 (i) Masseket Bahodesh, chapters 9-11. 22 The terminology of the school of R. Ishmael can be noticed in such passages as H-R 222, lines 12, 18; 223, line 3; 224, line 12; 225, line 15; 227, lines 11, 15; 230, lines 4, 11, 15; 231, line 6; 232, lines 14, 16; 233, line 7; 234, line 15. The Tannaim cited are also, in general, from the school of R. Ishmael: R. Nathan (H-R 226, line 18; 227, line 6), R. Mattiah ben Harash and R.

THE PATRICIAN ORIGIN OF AGGADIC MIDRASH I While aggadic Midrash I as a whole can hardly be ascribed to the school of R. Ishmael, it is definitely patri- cian in its outlook. This is shown in the fact that aggadic Midrash I accepts, as we have already noted, the Sham- maitic view that the heavens were created before the earth23 (Mekilta Beshallah, Vayyehi, chapter 8, H-R, 144, line 1, Laut. II, 64, line 69). It further has a definite tendency toward the anthropo- morphism which the Hillelites vigorously rejected. Per- haps no more anthropomorphic statement is to be found in the whole of rabbinic literature than that preserved in Mekilta Vayyassa, chap. 6 (H-R 175, line 6, Laut. II, 133, line 1, Mek. R. S. 17.6, p. 81) :24 nnJw r mp N o "npn 1t" 1n '1,1 , t Dmt tn ,1n Dwn xItD "God said to him, 'Wher- ever you will find the mark of man's feet, there I am before thee.'" The form cited in Mekilta of R. Simeon (loc. cit.) is even more strikingly anthropomorphic, for it reads: i' nt DtI n Mbnr nln- 'Vw lny: r7N "n: D W1 ni^ nD nNw mlpD i: l'mh r7my 'IN 0D (1"' ,'T ptrn') "God said to himn, 'Wherever you will see the mark of man's feet, as it is said, A likeness as the appearance of a man (Ezek. 1.26), there I am before thee.'" In view of this statement, we need not be surprised to find aggadic Midrash I insisting that God appeared in visible form to Israel both at the Red Sea and on Mt. Sinai.25 At the Red Sea He appeared in the guise of a young war- 23 The view of the Shammaites that the heavens were created before the earth is cited in Bereshit Rabbah 1.15, ed. Theodor, p. 13. 24 As Hoffmann in his note indicates, there can be no doubt whatever that this particular passage properly belongs to the Mekilta of R. Simeon, as it happens to be cited as such by R. Todros Abulafia. 25 For the patrician tendency to insist that God could appear in visible form, see Pharisees, pp. 119 ff.</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW rior; at Mt.

The passage corresponds to Sifre Deut. 343, Fr. 143a, Fi. 398, which is clearly based on aggadic Midrash I. See also for further emphasis on the Visible Appearance of God at Mt. Sinai, Mekilta Jethro, Bahodesh, chap. 3, H-R 212, line 9, Laut. II, 212, line 39, lacking in Mek. R. S.). A legal statement, in which aggadic Midrash I agrees with the patricians, occurs in Mekilta Jethro, Bahodesh, chap. 3, H-R 212, line 17, Laut. II, 214, line 55. It reads: nv Kw I"I= - ,n -I 9 'n nnrw '1"m 3 ,'L p D l p D DY .^ L n*"p b p K 9 p D 1 "But he shall surely be stoned. And whence do we know that he is to be thrown down? Because the verse reads, 'To throw down.' And whence do we know that if he died as a result of being thrown down, the law has been fulfilled? Because the verse reads, 'Let him be thrown down.' And whence do we know that all who are stoned must be hanged? Because the verse says, 'For he shall surely be stoned or thrown down.' "26 26 The reading 1,'in "they shall be hanged," is found in all the texts of the Mekilta, and must be accepted. Midrash ha-Gadol, which repro- duces this passage, has changed the word 1'mn into ],nm, in accordance with the accepted Halakah, which substitutes throwing from a height for the punishment of stoning, and which does not require hanging except for idolatry and blasphemy (Mishna Sanhedrin 6.4). Another example of the acceptance of the view of R. Eliezer ben Hyrkanos by the compiler of aggadic Midrash I has already been noted (p. 218). 230</page><page sequence="21">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 231 The view that all who are stoned are to be hanged, after their death, was that of R. Eliezer ben Hyrkanos,27 the exponent of Shammaitic doctrine, and was rejected by the majority of the Rabbis. Even more clearly patrician is the statement in Mekilta Jethro, Masseket Bahodesh, chap. 4, H-R 218, line 9, Laut. II, 227, line 94 (lacking in Mek. R. S.), a,nmi 1,n ],1n -nK 1n 1 'l 1Ki 1ui[ by, that Moses instructed the people to reply "Yes," to the positive commandments, and "No," to the negative commandments. This view is that attrib- uted to R. Ishmael only a few lines later, (H-R 219, line 1, Laut. II, 229, line 113); R. Akiba maintains that they answered "Yes" to all the commandments. The contro- versy probably has its origin in a dialectical usage; but it is noteworthy that the anonymous statement of aggadic Midrash I agrees with the view of R. Ishmael. IV. THE ADDITIONS (TOSEFTOT) TO THE TANNAITIC MIDRASSHIM Professor J. N. Epstein,28 Dean Saul Liebermann,29 and 130 have on various occasions remarked that the tannaitic Midrashim in their present form contain a considerable amount of material, drawn from what were originally mar- ginal annotations. From the margins, these statements were interpolated into the text itself, being originally marked off as Toseftot (additions). After these statements had been 27 Mishna Sanhedrin, loc. cit. 28 Abhandlungen zur Erinnerung an Hirsch Perez Chajes, Heb. section, pp. 60 ff. 29 See his Tashlum Tosefta, in Tosefta, ed.

In time, however, this mark of their extraneous origin was dropped; so that they can now be identified only with difficulty, by comparing various codices, and sometimes by the usual methods of critical analysis. A fortunate circumstance enables us to state this, no longer as an hypothesis but as an observable fact. For, in one of the ancient codices of the Sifra, we can actually see the process by which a marginal note was introduced into the text. The passage in question occurs in the current editions3' at the end of S'ifra Vcayyikra, perek 2, ed. Weiss 4b, lines 5 13, cf. ed. Friedmann, p. 38, line 1 p. 39, line 4, and reads as follows: 1z n r:CD ID in irn~'- V wiVir 1 rn-i n -u mrn 3'l " The reaingl of N ed.Wissilderives ofcorse,n frm ed.

The reason for this curious phenomenon becomes clear only when we compare the text of the current editions with that of the Mss., especially, the oldest dated Ms. of the Sifra, Cod. Assemani XXXI of the Vatican Library, which was written in the year 1078. In this codex, the passage reads: :tW ?D'Y m=, i,n ~ D,^i DWv D l"nmm 'h D, MS mrl ,,,DNI :nhn ma; nmpn man 'rninn ,to Re ioe n bWenA '' 'iW ,nmW rwn n, ntW 1''mn ,- n1 vn=m 'nV II- ,rmv l "tn 'oII, , , '"n added a' margi n noNt 'rept in g1 wht1 W lredy in tnh ina3 nMe WT n 'Wm sd, tnil 'he statemnt wn n otn mn etpr Iny 1t-1: lIy z-vnD n'm )1D' 'oN "1UK 1n pi try n ^N Dnp lDy nhin tnx Ity ansD ae tN tn e' lmnr txt ,at aln .Dmxy [nlxi Ms. Assemani XXXI contains, however, also a marginal note, which reads as follows: -lnsR i'in nDry l^YI Igy x mo n 'n Hi iin 'l- 'IInnn l nry^ .*1xy jnxiy WlY n' C'nD 1D'y -:"i= rr K 'Ws1N nvNI It is clear that the marginal note repeats, substantially, the statement ascribed to R. Eleazar ben Ahavai in the main text of the work. But why should the copyist have added a marginal note repeating what was already in the main text? The answer is obviously that when the mar- ginal note was composed, the statement was not yet part of the main text. It was added to the main text at a later time; and thus gives us clear evidence of the manner in which a marginal gloss crept into the text. Further evidence that the statement ascribed to R. Eleazar ben Ahavai was not originally part of the Sifra is to be found in the following considerations:</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW (a) The name R. Eleazar ben Ahavai does not otherwise occur in the tannaitic midrashim.32 (b) The script containing the statement in the main text of Cod. Assemani XXXI is very crowded, so that in order to include the whole statement, the writer was compelled to use cursive script for the last part of it, and to write the last few words in the space which had been left for the heading of the next Parasha. (c) There is a circle in Ms. Assemani XXXI above the abbreviation "-' and another above the word nty9N (in the main text) indicating that the copyist con- sidered that the passage beginning ntyi% should have preceded that beginning '"-. He could only have been led to this thought, by having before him a Ms. in which the passage beginning ntyi occurred as a marginal note to niv? 1's 'm n'm1.

These marginal annotations, which can thus be traced back to the oldest extant Ms. of the tannaitic Midrashim, actually originated, I believe, in Palestine. I have come to this conclusion from a consideration of the following gloss now contained in Sifre Deut. 8 (Fr. 66b, last line; Fi. 16, line 1):33 nlDo nl l: 1rO C -a ) n m. That this passage was originally a gloss is not open to doubt; it was still so marked in the text used by R. Hillel in the twelfth century. For in his commentary, R. Hillel cites the passage as follows: mnynri mnN Nz3 ~m rnDln Yet the passage occurs not only in all the extant texts of the Sifre itself, but is also quoted in the Yemenite Midrash ha-Gadol, showing that it was found also in the 33 The meaning of the passage is unfortunately obscure, as fre- quently happens in texts which were originally transmitted in the crowded margins, where they could not be given completely in the first place, and where the difficulty in reading was especially great. Appar- ently the author means to say, "Why does the Bible mention Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? If it is merely to confirm the Divine promise to the fathers, does not the prophet say, 'He hath sworn to the tribes with His word, selah (see Habakkuk 3.9).'"</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Yemenite text of the Sifre (see Midrcsh Tannaim, p. 5, line 32). Since this gloss is found in both the Yemenite and Euro- pean texts, it must derive from the parent text on which both are based. But it has been shown elsewhere34 that this text was that current in Palestine before the ninth century C. E. It follows therefore that the marginal gloss i ioD -inm niD mniy'i= nnt 13 H m now found in our Sifre texts originated in Palestine before the ninth century. Presumably, since it was copied as part of the Sifre text in both the Egyptian35 and European codices, it is consid- erably older than the ninth century; and indeed may have originated in the first texts of the Sifre to be put into writing. While the Toseftot occur with especial frequency in the Midrashim of the school of R. Akiba, and contain in general the variant comments from the Midrashim of the school of R. Ishmael, this is by no means always the fact. I have elsewhere drawn attention to similar glosses now found in the Mekilta of R. Ishmael. We have, in addition, a very interesting citation, directly quoted as a Tosefta to the Sifre on Numbers (a Midrash of the school of R. Ishmael). This citation occurs in Tosafot Baba Batra lla, catchword minm 'p and reads: K n D i n n 1 l D o n ^ tryI -n"n 1 ' J77 Ln n L'p. The passage is obviously cited from a gloss to Sifre Numbers 106, Fr. 28b, line 26; Horowitz 105, line 3.

The largest of these additions to the tannaitic Midrashim are apparently those found in the Sifra, and containing the whole portion dealing with the forbidden marriages. That this portion of the Sifra derives originally from the Midrash of the school of R. Ishmael on Leviticus has long been recognized.36 It is equally important to notice, how- ever, that the same is true of a large part, perhaps the whole, of the section of Miluim,37 describing the consecra- tion of Aaron and his sons. D. Hoffmann38 and, following him, Albeck,39 suggested that this section of the present text of the Sifra derives from another source than the main text. This conjecture now receives support from an exam- ination of the Breslau Ms. which lacks that portion of the Sifra, showing that it not merely derives from another source than the main text of the Sifra, but is in reality an alien element, or an interpolation. The text of this portion as found in the current editions was not, however, added all at one time. The whole text is indeed found not only in the editions, but also in several Mss. of the Sifra, including one Vatican Ms. (Assemani LXVI) and the Bodleian and British Museum Mss. Another Vatican Ms. of the Sifra (Assemani XXXI), as well as Ms. Parma, contain only part of it, omitting that portion which covers Leviticus 9.1 to 10.7 (ed. Weiss 43c-46b, line 10).

The main portion was inserted at an early date, and then mar- ginal notes were added to it, which later became part of the text. The facts thus far presented indicate that our present texts of the tannaitic Midrashim contain material drawn from diverse sources. The main texts in each instance derive from the school with which the particular Midrash happens to be associated. But in each Midrash there are also contained "additions" deriving from the opposite schools. V. CONCLUSION The analysis of the various midrashic texts which have been examined has shown definitely that much of the material in our present tannaitic Midrashim has been inter- polated. The excision of these interpolations is a necessary prerequisite to a discussion of the extent to which the dif- ferent Midrashim actually represent the views of the schools to which they have been assigned. It is my belief, as I have had occasion to state before, that after the interpolations have been removed, we will discover a nucleus going back to the school of R. Ishmael, in the Midrashim which Friedmann and Hoffmann ascribed to that group; and of the school of R. Akiba which these scholars ascribed to that group. The aggadic material must, obviously, be studied quite independently from the halakic sections. The sources from 40 Rashi cites the comment on Lev. 9.23 as 1:sy D"n by nsD0nn snnnI "A Baraita added to our Sifra" and apparently it was so marked in his text. 238</page><page sequence="29">SOURCES OF TANNAITIC MIDRASHIM-FINKELSTEIN 239 which the Aggada is drawn are entirely independent from that of the Halakah. Each school took over the Aggada which was the common heritage of all groups, and at most simply changed the text here and there to suit its own cus- tom. While the aggadic Midrashim were put into some form of abbreviated writing before they were added to our present Midrashim, the text was still sufficiently fluid for certain changes to be made in it. Hence it came about, for instance, that when the same Aggada is cited in Sifre Numbers, Sifre Zuta, Mekilta and Mekilta of R. Simeon, the texts of Sifre Numbers and Mekilta agree with one another as opposed to those found in Sifre Zuta and Mekilta of R. Simeon.4' 41 The tendency of the Sifre Zuta to agree with the text of the Mekilta of R. Simeon, and that of the Sifre to agree with the text of the Mekilta, in rendering the same aggadic passage, is strikingly illustrated in the following, which occurs in Mekilta Beshallah, Proemium, p. 81; Mekilta of R. Simeon 14.21, p. 21; Sifre Numbers 83 (Fr. 22a, Horowitz 79); Sifre Zuta 10.33, p. 266. The text of Mekilta of R.

But there is evidence that even after the close of the Palestinian Talmud, the tra- ditions of the schools of R. Ishmael and R. Akiba were carefully distinguished from each other, at least in the Palestinian academies. The most recent evidence for this has been adduced by Dean Saul Liebermann. He shows that the liturgist, Yannai,42 whose date cannot be definitely fixed, but who lived no earlier than the fourth century C. E., followed the school of R. Ishmael rather than that of R. Akiba, in several important controversies. The fact that so late an authority still dared decide in accordance with the con- servative school of R. Ishmael, and against the school of R. Akiba, is particularly noteworthy, because our general impression from a study of the Talmud is that the contro- the main text, and giving the variants from the Sifre in parentheses, and marking by spacing, the parts of the Mekilta to which they are variants: ( 1 ) ' n ': m 1' -I y n;( (in)K 'iDn) -i D I n:S n y: DMsi' J1IM Mn &gt;) Iip -lnil 0nriy Dlnly 7p3l ( D1' iN'if ', I pyl) D D 1 (1" ,' it i t) lprue, the t ("' ,'D fr) 3yZa and Mki ( f R.

Akiba in the early centuries of the Common Era. Obviously, we were mistaken in this assump- tion. Both traditions survived until comparatively late times; and just as the Shammaitic customs were followed by many43 Galileans, although they had been formally rejected by the academies; so the views of the school of R. Ishmael still had many adherents in geonic times. It was these adherents, doubtless, who preserved the Mid- rashim of the school of R. Ishmael for us, so that we pos- sess almost as many of them as we do of the Midrashim of the school of R. Akiba; although our Mishna and the works associated with it are definitely from the school of R. Akiba. APPENDIX The passage, Ily r1i'y mDln nyml '3 tK6 1' n -P T YW WK, ,nnM 1lnm-N ';rWi 5',r= InbN, has been curiously mis- interpreted, partly because of a misunderstanding of the text itself, and partly because of a corruption of the text in ed. pr. It is obvious from the text of Mekilta of R. Simeon that the comment refers to the horses of the chariot, and not to the men in the chariot. As is well known, the Roman chariot contained even in late times only two persons, the driver and the combatant. According to the passage, how- ever, it had become customary to add one reserve horse to the chariot. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel indicates his belief that this innovation was instituted by Pharaoh, and he finds support for this belief in the use of the term Wtv'v. Hence, R. Simeon ben Gamaliel says, according to the 43 See JQR, N. S., XXIX (1938-39), pp. 179-186; and cf. S. Lieber- mann, Shkiin, (Jerusalem, 1939), pp. 21 ff.</page><page sequence="32">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW text of Mekilta of R.

Pharaoh came, and added one more so as to expedite the pursuit of Israel." The Baraita is interpreted precisely in the same manner in Yer. Kilayim 8.2, 31c, where we read: CDS 7t1nP r1n=3' mlN= TN 3'D-T DinW =h= MTn Hi I' 1WMN 193 by D'lwrsw1 pnn W1n n6Vrivyl m9 -Ony 19. "At first there were only two horses in the chariot, as it is written, 'And he made him ride in the double chariot which he had' (Gen. 41.43). Pharaoh arose and added a third, as it is written, 'and third ones for them all.' " The context in Yerushalmi deals with the problem of animals attached to various types of vehicles, and there can be no question that the Baraita is cited as bearing on the number of horses attached to a military chariot. Targum Ps. Jonathan, doubtless paraphrasing the Baraita cited in Mekilta, ex- pressly speaks of the animals drawing the chariots. It reads &amp;nzm i: y ]'D1N 1I'r 11rDv '1m r^ n rnlin Rn'I7nl In the light of these passages, it seems probable that the original text of the Mekilta, too, referred to horses, rather than charioteers. The texts of the Mss. of the Mekilta, according to Horovitz-Rabin, read: 7 ''Wwm;] wv,v nr 13zn:'n 5yr [3 ,rv'. The word ywv may be a corruption for 5v as found in Mekilta of R. Simeon. More probably, however, 5yw is correct, and means "next to," referring to the fact that the third beast did not draw the chariot, but was attached to it from the side. The masculine form ','wv rt is probably a corruption for n,wrv ir. The mis- understanding of the Mekilta is due in large measure to the text of ed. pr., which reads: .n 3D3 C 1 n D ' ?

The statement attributed to Rabbi (Judah the Patriarch) is unfortunately not clear. According to the text of Mekilta of R. Simeon, Rabbi disagrees with his father, R. Simeon ben Gamaliel, and maintains that Antoninus added the third beast of the chariot. This is expressed in the phrase: ?DI'nT D13imtO, "Antoninus added it." But according to the text cited in Yer. Kilayim 8.2, 31c, Rabbi refers to the fourth beast, which was frequently added to the chariot. (While Rabbi is not actually quoted in Yer., there can be little doubt that the view preserved there is correctly attributed to him in Mekilta.) The text of Mekilta is ambiguous. It may be rendered, "Antoninus (rather than Pharaoh) added one more"; or it may be rendered, "Anto- ninus added one more" to the three of Pharaoh, making a total of four. Ed. pr. changes the text so as to leave no doubt that the latter interpretation is the correct one, according to the opinion of that copyist. In the light of the passage of Yer., it is, indeed, probable that this is what the original Haggadist meant.</page></plain_text>
