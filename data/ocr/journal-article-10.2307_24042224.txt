<plain_text><page sequence="1">1956 of Pacific Coast Geographers 23 CULTURE AND THE IDEA OF NATURE Clarence J. Glacken University of California, Berkeley Generations of modern scientists have tried to understand the processes of nature as revealed—not in the whole creation—but in the living and inert matter appearing in the countless variety of landscapes on earth. Students of man have made equally great efforts to understand human society by observing the evidence of historical records or of archeological discovery. The most puzzling questions have arisen when attempts have been made to discover relationships existing between human cultures and the natural environment. In modern times, conceptions of these relationships have been influenced by the idea of nature which has been widely accepted by the scientific thinking of an age. Since the seventeenth century ideas of nature and of man's relationship to it have changed greatly, although a continuity of thought from that time to the present is clearly discernible. The dominant theme among the seventeenth and eighteenth century thinkers was that nature, of which man and his works were a part, was an all-embracing harmony. In the nineteenth century this unity of thought was lost and various interpretations of nature replaced it; some thinkers emphasized the struggle for existence, others the complex interrelation ships in nature, still others the modifications of nature made by human activities. In our own times, the idea of conscious control of nature through science and the idea of nature as a delicately poised balance which is easily disturbed by human interferences have been widely used in general discussions of cultural and environmental change. Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Thought Toward the end of the seventeenth century the dominant conception of nature—and the one which has been emphasized in histories of science—was the mechanistic view which owed its widespread acceptance to the prestige of mathematics and to the scientific and philosophical works of men like Galileo, Descartes, and Newton: the universe of which the earth was a part was like a great machine. Nature owed its orderliness to an underlying me chanical order far removed from the bright and colorful beauties of external nature. A. N. Whitehead in a famous passage in Science and the Modern World thought this conception of nature to be characteristic of seventeenth century thought.1 Whitehead's characterization applies however to only one segment of seventeenth century thought, for it neglects the scientists in natural history who, far from accepting the dismal implications of the mechanical view, emphasized —with the inspiration and prestige of an idea probably as old as Western civilization itself—that the earth was a divinely designed environment, fit for the living together of the countless variety of beings, from the simplest to the most complex organisms, which were widely distributed among the different environments of the earth. This idea, with its roots strong in Greek philosophy,</page><page sequence="2">24 Yearbook of the Association Vol. 18 in the elaborations of the Stoic philosophers, and in Christian theology, and with an emphasis on anthropomorphism and teleology which later science was to find so distasteful, at least called forth (what the abstract mechanical view did not) an appreciation of the beauties of nature, and stimulated study of the inter relationships existing in it, for by so doing one not only learned more about nature but found in these discoveries further evidences of the wisdom of God. The works of the famous botanist John Ray are excellent examples of this point of view because they discuss in much greater detail than do other con temporary works the biological nature of the earth; they also bring out clearly conflicts in contemporary beliefs concerning the nature of the earth. Ray not only dismissed the mechanistic view which I have already described, but also the notion, revived from classical antiquity, that the earth was subject to decay and that the force and vigor of nature had declined from previous ages. In criticizing this notion, Ray and other contemporaries of like mind revealed the optimistic tone of their thinking: God would not create a world whose vigor declined with age; there was a constancy in nature, the result of the divine plan, upon which mankind could rely. To these men, the areas occupied by human cultures were those parts of nature which had been changed by art; they were an expression of the coop eration of man with God in following His design by making pleasantly tilled fields out of wasteland or out of unsightly marshes. To seek in nature the proofs of God's wisdom, said John Ray, was a .task of "thinking God's thoughts after him." Here there was no warfare between science and theology; how could there be when each fresh discovery confirmed in greater and more accurate detail the truth of the great design?2 The idea of a designed earth, an earth that is the home and the nursery of mankind, was a commonplace in the geographical thought of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. In 1767, Anton Buching wrote in the introduction to his eleven volume description of the countries and regions of the known world that the chief utility of geography was that through it one's perception of God as the creator and the preserver of all thinks was greatly deepened.3 The same idea appears in that great eighteenth century work of synthesis, Herder's Outlines of the Philosophy of the History of Mankind. It is of course the main theme of the philosophical writings of Carl Ritter. When his disciple, Arnold Guyot, told a Lowell Institute audience in Boston in 1847 that "it is correct to say that inorganic nature is made for organized nature, and the whole globe for man, as both are made for God, the origin and end of all things," he was reiterating a philosophy concerning man and the earth that would have been known and widely accepted from the time of Xenophon to his own.4 It was only a step from the seventeenth century conception to the one developed by the French naturalists of the eighteenth, of nature as a vast and complex harmony, with however less emphasis on the design of the creator, more on harmonies which were revealed in the beauties of the earth's land scapes. The best exposition of this conception is in the Natural History and in</page><page sequence="3">1956 of Pacific Coast Geographers 25 the Epochs of Nature of Buffon: man through art and skill is changing nature, but these changes occur within the harmony of the whole. Human cultures, Buffon said, had embellished nature by domesticating plants and animals, by cultivation and by drainage. If man occasionally destroyed too much, nature, endowed with its great reproductive powers, could restore the harmonies. Man appears like a monarch reigning over the princes of the blood, the commoners, and the colonials: he adjudicates and tempers the struggles in the plant and animal world and acts as a caretaker of nature. The writings of Alexander von Humboldt carried the conception of a unity and harmony of nature even further; his work and that of his immediate pre decessors like Captain Cook and George Forster, had made Western science much better acquainted with the tropics. His point of view is a distinct departure from that of Ritter, for von Humboldt was interested in demonstrating the unity and diversity of nature without pressing the teleological and anthropomorphic idea of the traditional philosophy. The Nineteenth Century In the nineteenth century, first the Lamarckian, then the Darwinian, theories of evolution effectively challenged the older teleological and anthropomorphic conception, superseding also in scientific interest ideas expressed by Buffon and von Humboldt. Although Lamarck emphasized the adaptation of life to its en vironment, it was the Darwinian theory of natural selection that carried the day. Organisms with an unlimited power to multiply, if uninterfered with, existed in a limited environment, a thesis which Darwin derived from the Malthusian principle of population: inevitably there was a new emphasis on competition in nature even though many pre-Darwinian thinkers had mentioned it. Students of human society promptly applied this interpretation of nature to human cultures; the competition of modern nation-states for trade and ter ritory was interpreted as a struggle for living space in a limited world. The idea that cultural processes are like those observable in nature is common in the geographical writings of the late nineteenth century, particularly in the works of Ratzel, though it would be unfair to suggest that the idea of a struggle for existence in human society dominated his thought. Ratzel's idea of a battle for living space, however, was an important element in the later development of German geopolitical thought. Another aspect of Darwin's thought, the conception of the web of life, was obscured in the bitter nineteenth century controversies over phylogeny. Like the earlier writers, Darwin pointed out that "plants and animals remote in the scale of nature are bound together by a web of complex relations."5 The web of life, like the struggle for existence, was a metaphorical expression, for both expres sions were intended to convey the idea of intricate interrelationships which had evolved through time. The metaphor of the web, however, suggested interrela tionships more than struggle and competition. This web of life concept is one of the historical roots of modern ecological thinking which in turn is the theoretical basis for many modern ideas relating to the conservation of renewable resource*</page><page sequence="4">26 Yearbook of the Association Vol.18 In retrospect, however, what is astonishing about the nineteenth century is the thoroughness of the study of environmental change brought about by human activities, and, one should hasten to add, the widespread failure to see the implications of these investigations—which were that nature could not be studied without considering the changes resulting from man's economic and cultural activities. An extensive literature on torrents, water control, deforestation, soil erosion, and agricultural practices came into being, a literature which in the aggregate constituted impressive evidence of the far-reaching influences of culture on nature. George Marsh and Nathaniel Shaler in America, John Croumbie Brown in England, Victor Hehn in Germany, Alexander Woeikof in Russia, and Vidal de la Bloche in France, however, saw the implications of this new study: it is this awareness of the power of human cultures to change the physical environment which really cut away the underpinnings of the older environmentalism that saw human cultures as adaptations or responses to environmental conditions. Thus, the nineteenth century left to the twentieth a rich legacy but the heirs could not be blamed if they became confused by the provisions of the will: the struggle for existence was applied to human society, the same environmental controls operating there as in nature. The web of life concept carried on the old tradition of a balanced and harmonious nature but the tendency was to apply it to a biological environment which excluded man, while the studies of environmental change by human activities suggested a certain fragility of nature at the mercy of cultural advance. The Present Century In our own times, prevailing ideas of nature and culture can be discussed with less assurance because these ideas vary with fields of knowledge which are isolated, at least to some degree, from one another; one cannot speak of a consensus of opinion held by scientists and humanists. There are two broad views toward nature which I think can be discerned in contemporary thinking. The first of these is that man has now, through science, reached a high degree of purposive and conscious mastery of nature. Discovery and invention, through the application of the scientific method, can be made with desired goals in mind, whether these are in nuclear physics, genetics, or in agricultural chemistry. Although this mastery naturally might lead to the destruction of civilization, it also has given confidence to many that science can provide food for growing populations and prevent—even correct— damage from man-induced soil erosion and deforestation. This kind of control over nature is part of our concept of a modern culture, a sense of control which now is being disseminated, even more rapidly than in the past, throughout the world. The second of these is that man has now, by incidental, unconscious, and haphazard activities interfered with the delicate and fragile balance of nature, that these interferences have been going on since prehistoric times and are cumulative, and that the habitability of the earth is threatened, especially with increasing technological power, population growth, and the world-wide demands for a higher standard of living. Nature, from this point of view, far from being</page><page sequence="5">1956 of Pacific Coast Geographers 27 controlled, is being destroyed by the vast accumulation of interferences, some from highly industrialized and mechanized societies, others from simpler non industrialized peoples. The fate of human culture thus becomes inextricably in volved with the changes which have taken place and are occurring in the natural environment. I will not attempt here to state the case for either one of these views, for my task is a more modest one. It is to point out that differences in attitudes toward great questions such as these can be understood better by studying the literature of the past than that of the present and that through study of the history of ideas in the sciences and social sciences we can discover how ideas have started and how they have changed from one generation to the next and how they have often been put to new and unsuspected uses. The cultures both of the past and the present indisputably have made and are making great changes in their physical environments; the student however does not make a catalogue of these changes, for that would be impossible and meaningless. He tries to interpret them within a framework of ideas which he has acquired. It is important that he and his readers know with precision what these ideas are and their underlying presuppositions. Both the idea of control over nature through science and the idea of a balance of nature are part of the heritage of the past; in the first we see the progress of science, a product of the reasoning, experimentation, and inventiveness of man, in the second we see the balance of nature subject to human interferences. Do our interpretations differ depending upon whether we look at the progress of science or at the changes of the natural environment? I think they might. The first idea leads to an interpretation of history as a gradual divorcement from environmental controls, the second to an interpretation of increasingly active involvement with the natural environment. Such investigations can reveal the nature of the new and old ideas which are used to create world views. Through such studies one can understand the interpretations of the historical experience of man which each generation creates anew for itself. Literature Cited Whitehead, Alfred North. 1948.
