<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes A LATE GOTHIC ALTARPIECE FROM GDAŇSK. A previously unpublished fifteenth-century altarpiece decorat- ed with woodcut Passion scenes is the subject of a recent study by Adam S. Labuda, 'Póžnošredniowieczny oitarzyk z košciota Mariackiego w Gdaňsku i jego drzeworyty/Ein spätmittelalterliches Altärchen mit Holzschnitten aus der Marienkirche in Danzig' (. Ikonotheka , xix, 2006, pp. 189-212; Polish, with a German summary). The portable altarpiece, probably made for private devotion, was formerly in the col- lections of St Mary's Church in Gdansk (Danzig), but was lost during World War II. Labuda's new research into this little studied artwork was made possible by the survival of a pre-war photograph in the archive of the National Museum in Gdaňsk (fig. 237). His article draws attention to the altar- piece's iconographie features and employs comparative material to help establish its provenance. The published archival photograph of the Gdaňsk altar- piece shows two wings, each decorated with a pair of Passion scenes: the Betrayal of Christ and the Flagellation on the left, and Christ before Pilate and the Crucifixion on the right. Labuda proposes that these wings may once have formed part of a triptych in which a larger central image would have domi- nated. He uses inventoriai records to confirm that the four photographed scenes were woodcuts on paper affixed to the wooden wings. Each scene was executed using two wood- blocks: one for the main image and another for the decora- tive rosette and acanthus-leaf border. The woodcuts were heightened with watercolour and their edges concealed with thin wooden strips, thus giving the impression of a more costiy painted artwork. This careful simulation of a tradi- tional painted altarpiece is an important example of the integration of early prints into late medieval devotion. It also provides a useful comparison with later woodcut artworks, such as a choirstall decorated with sixteenth-century Passion PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200J, 4</page><page sequence="2">NOTES 429 237.

The Gdansk Passion altarpiece demonstrates skilled han- dling of the woodcut technique, both in composition and execution. Labuda highlights the close attention to detail in the contextualization of each scene, such as the depiction of rocky ground in the Betrayal image, or the Gothic arches used as a framing device in the Flagellation. There is further manifestation of spatial awareness in the ability to depict both complex crowd scenes (the Betrayal and Christ before Pilate) and sparser compositions (the Flagellation and Crucifixion). In the arrangement of figures, Labuda demon- strates how the Gdansk woodcuts draw widely from inter- national iconographie models; parallels exist in French, Burgundian and Netherlandish painted artworks from the second half of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fif- teenth century. His findings determine that the woodcuts were produced in South Germany; the three more accom- plished prints were executed after designs of around 1430, while the Christ before Pilate scene was probably added slight- ly later by a less accomplished artist. These conclusions are compatible with the provenance of the woodcut borders, made to fit the images, which are shown to be characteristic of South German work of around 1440. Through such detailed analysis of a previously unstudied late medieval devotional artwork, Labuda provides valuable information about the production and use of early wood- cuts, and illuminates the close interrelation between print- making and painting in the fifteenth century, aleksandra KOUTNY-JONES CHERUBINO ALBERTI, LELIO ORSI AND CORNELIS CORT. In her article in this Journal, An Etching and Lelio Orsi's House' ( Print Quarterly , xxin, 2006, pp. 176-82), Catherine King provides a sound analysis of the graphic evidence pertaining to the architectural decoration of Orsi's house(s) in or around Reggio. Although we have little to add to her case in this regard, the fact that it centres on a handsome, heretofore anonymous architectural print of a Bowman prompts us to offer a small correction to the New Hollstein volume on Cornelis Cort, and also to argue an attribution for the print ( Cornelis Cort , compiled by Manfred Sellink, edited by Huigen Leeflang, The New Hollstein : Dutch and Flemish Etchings, Engravings and Woodcuts 1450-1700, Rotterdam 2000, part 3, p. 253, no. 48, countering J. C.J. Bierens de Haan's attribution to Cort: L'oeuvre gravé de Cornelis Cort, graveur hollandais , The Hague 1948, p. 214, no. 244). Citing Sellink, King identifies the Bowman as the first state of an etching known in two states, whereas in fact it is the first state of an engraving (as De Haan recognized), record- ed in three states: I/III without the lined background (Vienna, Albertina; Washington, National Gallery of Art); II/III with the lined background (Rotterdam, Boijmans van Beuningen Museum; Vienna, Albertina); III/III with the number ' 68 ' added in the lower left corner. There is also a counterproof of the first, not second state as recorded in Hollstein (New York, Nadine Orenstein collection). Although the subject does not fit the context, this engrav- ing appeared in Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae. Quae in Publicis Privatisque Locis Visuntur Icones , a suite of reproductive prints after antique sculpture to be seen in public and pri- vate collections in Rome, published there in three editions between 1584 and 1621. Taken together, Sellink's convincing rejection of Cornelis Cort as the author of the Bowman , the re-identification of the medium as an engraving and its pub- lication in the Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae , reopen the question of its attribution. The connection between the engraving and the Orsi commission was already pointed out by Pierre Jean Mariette, who also correctly identified the medium, noted its inclusion in the series of prints of antique sculpture in Rome and questioned the attribution to Cort. However, Mariette mistakenly gives the date as 1570 (P.J. Mariette, Abecedario de PJ. Mariette et autres notes inédites de cet amateur sur les arts et les artistes , Paris, 1851-60, iv, reprinted 1966, p. 63, cited in A. E. Popham and J. Wilde, The Italian Drawings of the XV and XVI Centuries in the Collection of His Majesty the King at Windsor Castle , London 1949, no. 529. See also L. C. J. Frerichs, Italiaanse Tekenirwen II /de iRde en i6de eeuw, Amsterdam iq8i, p. 86, no. 283). The Bowman appears in all three editions of the Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae. The first edition with 73 plates was published by Lorenzo Vaccari in 1584 (Rome, Bibliotheca Hertziana). The second edition with 80 plates was published sometime before 1614, either by Lorenzo or by his sons Andrea and Michelangelo (Oxford, St John's College Library; San Marino CA, Huntington Library, lacking two plates). The third edition, also with 80 plates, was published by Gottifredus de Schaicis (Goert van Schaych) (Fondo Cicognara Program, Vatican Library [Urbana Illinois, Í989-], no. 3477 (A), microform). The number '6#' (state III/III) was added in the last edition when the series was reordered. The sequence of editions is given by Thomas Ashby ('Antiquae Statuae Urbis Romae', in Papers of the British School at Rome , ix, 1920, 5, pp. 123-29). See also Wolfgang Weeke, Ein römisches Antikenstichwerk von 1584 (Frankfurt am Main 1997, pp. 17-26). The second edition is probably that mentioned in the 1614 stocklist of Michelangelo and Andrea Vaccari's shop ('Vn libro di ottanta pezzi di statue diuerse di Roma delle più principali, intagliate da Cherubino Alberti, Filippo Tomassini et Villamena et altri diuersi valent'huomini', in F. Ehrle, Roma prima di Sisto V: la pianta di Roma Du Pérac-Lafréry del 1577, Rome 1908, p. 64). Datings for the second edition vary from 1607 to 1614. Weeke (p. 6), proposes c. 1607; Ashby (pp. 127-28) posits a date after the formation of the Borghese collection (c. 1608?) and no later than the 1614 stocklist. Of the three printmakers mentioned by name in the stocklist as having contributed to the project, Cherubino is the only tenable candidate, and his name was already tentatively advanced by Weeke (p. 199). The 1579 date of the engraving reasonably precludes an attribution to Francesco Villamena (1565-1624), as well as to the French printmaker Philippe Thomassin (1562-1622) who PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200J, 4</page><page sequence="4">NOTES 431 was not active in Rome until 1585 (Michael Bury, The Print in Italy 1550-1620, London 2001, pp. 234, 236). The plate for the Bowman is inscribed 1579, close in date to Cherubino's three signed engravings for the Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae , all four of them similar in handling (see The Illustrated Bartsch , edited by S. Buffa, xxxrv, nos. 98, 154 (dated 1577) and 99, dated 1578). Moreover, Cherubino's Circumcision of Christ (TIB, no. 14), also dated 1579, was reissued by Lorenzo Vaccari in 1580 and is listed in the 1614 Vaccari stocklist, providing yet another connection to the publisher. Early in his career Cherubino initiated a number of engravings after contemporary artists, including several reproductive prints that depict single figures occasionally taken from a larger programme with some architectural detail. And at least in some cases he retained control of the prints (see Christopher Witcombe, 'Cherubino Alberti and the Ownership of Engraved Plates, Print Quarterly , vi, 1989, p. 166). The fact that the Bowman appeared in the second state already in the 1584 edition of the Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae suggests that the lined background was added in order to make the plate correspond with others in the series. How he might have known Orsi's design, and why it should have been included in a suite of antiquities, remain unclear, and as Ashby suggests, this may be due to nothing more than having an available print to fill out the series to an even number. The Huntington Library copy, likely typical in its format, is printed on bifolios with the engravings facing one another across the opening of a continuous sheet, with the following opening left blank. Thus, the added plate is inte- gral to the composition of the booklet and not an isolated addition. Given that he was already involved on the project, Cherubino was an obvious source for acquiring an addi- tional plate. In sum, the circumstantial evidence points strongly to Cherubino Alberti's authorship, and the formal and technical evidence in no way speak against it. We are indebted to Huigen Leeflang, Philine Helas and Catherine Whistler for help in checking specific states and editions. PETER PARSHALL AND NAOKO TAKAHATAKE SWANEVELT. Although limited in scope, the exhibition in Woerden, Swanevelt's birthplace, was the first devoted to this artist's work, and with the accompanying catalogue (Florence de Graaf et al., Het zuiden tegemoet: De landschappen van Herman van Swanevelt 1603-1655, Woerden, Stadsmuseum, 7 April-8 July 2007, Woerden, Stadsmuseum, 2007, 84 pp., 103 col. and 17 b. &amp; w. ills., €19.95), it displayed Swanevelt to advantage as painter, draughtsman and printmaker. The 35 prints shown considerably outnumbered the paintings and drawings. This is perhaps apt, as it was predominantly through the diffusion of his prints that this artist's reputation was maintained into the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies, as numerous third and fourth states confirm. In the nineteenth century, German artists working in Rome great- ly admired Swanevelt's prints, preferring his comparative fidelity to nature and his closely observed Roman ruins to the more fictional landscapes of Lorrain, Poussin, Dughet and Rosa. The Large Cascade and A Group of Trees (cat. nos. 47, 48), two of a series of four horizontal prints in which noble, towering trees dwarf tiny figures, display exactly the kind of qualities that would have appealed to artists of the Romantic movement, for whom the anthropomorphic power of nature was central. Born in Woerden c. 1604, Swanevelt travelled to Italy via Paris, and lived in Rome between 1629 and 1641. He then returned to Paris, where he died in 1655. In Rome he was a leading figure in the second wave of Northern painters who pioneered the so-called Dutch Italianate style, a conflation of Dutch Naturalism and Italian Classicism, which he then introduced into France. He reproduced none of his paintings as prints, but the subject-matter of many of his numerous etchings is closely connected to his printmaking. Swanevelt's nickname, Herman the Hermit (Monsù Ermanno, l'Eremita) derived from his solitary sketching expeditions into the Roman countryside, and although most of his prints were published in Paris, these Roman drawings were in con- stant use as reference. Swanevelt's active career as a print- maker in the French capital was facilitated through connec- tions made in Rome, where he lived in the same house as the French publisher Charles Audran, whose name is found on Swanevelt's etchings made both in Rome and Paris. Of those displayed, Balaam and the Angel (cat. no. 54) and the series of seven prints of animals (cat. nos. 30-36) are all first states. Swanevelt's etchings can be divided into four basic subject categories: mythology, religious themes, animals and views - predominantly of Rome. In the Stadsmuseum the prints were displayed with the drawings, but were distributed throughout a sequence of ill-assorted rooms in no apparent order. The effect was somewhat piecemeal, although key aspects of Swanevelt's extensive print production (Bartsch and Hollstein record 117 prints) were adequately represent- ed by high quality examples. Viewed individually, these were extremely satisfying. Landscape with Sunset (cat. no. 63) is espe- cially instructive about how Swanevelt could vary his tech- nique, in this case a sketchy, impressionistic style in conjunc- tion with deeply etched shadows and transparent skies, rem- iniscent of Rembrandt. Preparatory drawings for half of Swanevelt's print oeuvre are known, so it was disappointing that there were not more pairings to show the variations in his technique between the two media. When drawings were coupled with prints, such as Abraham Entertaining the Three Angels (cat. no. 56) and its preparatory drawing (cat. no. 55), this clearly revealed the changes between preliminary drawing and finished print, as well as the colouristic qualities of Swanevelt's graphic style; sometimes subtle, sometimes dramatic, with fluctuations of light and dark, its features were emphasized and enhanced in the etching process. Many of Swanevelt's prints were issued as groups, sets or series, and it is a pity that complete runs were not obtainable especially of his Roman views, in particular the Diverses veués ... de Rome, etc. (1653) and twelve larger landscapes with ruins, six of which were displayed (cat. nos. 41-46). The lat- ter were especially impressive, their effects of space and atmosphere lending an appropriate grandeur to the antique subject-matter. Four of the six prints comprising the story of PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="5">432 NOTES Venus and Adonis (1654) gave a good idea of Swanevelt's use of landscape as an expressive narrative device (cat. nos. 49-52), and a group of prints of four hermit saints (cat. nos. 37-40) reflected the subjects, if not the compositions, of Swanevelt's important landscapes of the 1630s for Philip IV of Spain's Buen Retiro palace. These four prints had a tighter, polished technique, as though the religious subjects merited a more refined handling. The complete sequence of animal prints (cat. nos. 30-36) showed how effective a series could be when hung together, demonstrating the artist's ability to vary his compositions within a single theme, a characteristic of Swanevelt's entire oeuvre. Indeed, the organization of the prints in the cata- logue, placed side by side in their subject groups, gives an excellent idea of his considerable ability to avoid the formu- laic, creating a cohesive impression that the hang did not entirely achieve. Nevertheless, this was an extremely worth- while exhibition in which Swanevelt's range and quality as a printmaker clearly emerged. One hopes that it will lead to an increased inclusion of his works in future shows as a fine exponent of the landscape print. SUSAN RUSSELL MARIA KATHARINA PRESTEL. Stating that not much research has yet been undertaken on the life and œuvre of Maria Katharina Prestei (1747-94) is a diplomatic formu- la to cover the relative neglect of this artist. Beside a few remarks in the usual handbooks and dictionaries, often in the context of her husband, Johann Gotdieb Prestei, little substantial has been published. Only in the 1990s did a few publications appear that focussed at least partly on her as an independent artist working closely with her husband. A first step to fill this gap is Claudia-Alexandra Schwaighofer's Die Kunst der Nachahmung: Dürer, Carracci und Parmigianino in den Reproduktions-graphiken der Niirnbergeñn Maña Katharina Prestei (i 747-1 794) (Stuttgart, ibidem- Verlag, 2006, 216 pp., 21 b. &amp; w. ills., €30.80). A main aim of this publication, which was the author's Magister (MA) thesis in 2001, was to clarify Prestel's biography and to examine in greater detail the cooperation between her and her husband. A side issue was a more general point of examining prints after drawings. Maria Katharina, born in Nuremberg in 1747, was the first daughter of the merchant Thomas Holl and his wife Maria. Her wealthy family provided an initial education in drawing, but this was not intended to lead to a career as a profession- al artist. The rôle of female artists in Germany during the late seventeenth or eighteenth century, such as Maria Sybilla Merian, Angelika Kauffmann or members of the Dietzsch family, was generally seen as less important than that of their male counterparts. It is therefore especially relevant that Schwaighofer clarifies the biography and opens a context for a discussion of female artists in eighteenth-century Germany. Only through her marriage to Johann Gottlieb Prestei in 1772 was Maria Katharina able to devote herself to becoming a professional artist. The couple founded a work- shop that specialized in prints after drawings, mosdy based on the newly developed technique of aquatint, usually used with other media. Between 1776 and 1785 they published together with the Praunsches Kabinett, the Schmidtsches Kabinett and the Kleines Kabinett (Small Cabinet) and gained a well-known reputation not only in Germany but across Europe. In 1786 Prestei decided to leave her husband. She settled first in Frankfurt, then in London, where she quickly gained a high reputation as an outstanding engraver and artist. Schwaighofer's book clearly fills a gap in an assessment of Prestel's work. The biographical information remains patchy, as many archives have been destroyed, but through some contemporary information Schwaighofer is able to draw a picture of the artist's life and education and her early years as a printmaker. She then examines various aspects of the prints after drawings. First, she looks into the growing fashion of collecting drawings in eighteenth-century Germany, and the popularity of prints after drawings and their specific rôle in the artistic discourse at the time. Second, she discusses the three cabinets Prestei was involved in including the contemporary perception of them. The largest chapter, however, is a discussion of some sheets that have been grouped by their drawing technique and its print- ed representation. This is important, because Schwaighofer is able to outiine some of the ideas and issues that preoccu- pied Prestei when she made prints after these drawings. Because the techniques employed depended on the tech- nique of the drawing itself, its paper and colours, the out- come was not straightforward, but the result of an individual approach to each drawing. These remarks are summarized in a catalogue at the end of the book. Overall, the book closes a gap in the monographs devot- ed to German printmaking in the second half of the eigh- teenth century. For non-specialists, it may seem unimpor- tant, but when examining prints after drawings from that period, the various recueils published and the rise of the art book, it becomes an issue in a much wider context. This book is not the final word either on Prestei herself or on prints after drawings and there are a few minor omissions of recent literature, but the important fact remains that Schwaighofer assembled the available information, placed it in a suitable framework and thus started to close this gap. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN ART HISTORIOGRAPHY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. It is unusual for this journal to review unpub- lished doctoral theses, for good and understandable reasons. However, an exception needs to be made because of the out- standing quality of the work in question, and because it opens up a wide field of print scholarship for the future. The subject of Ingrid R. Vermeulen's thesis is 'Picturing Art History: The Rise of the Illustrated History of Art in the Eighteenth Century' (Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2006), and it links prints to the growing interest in art literature and paper collections. A few publications have dealt with illustrated volumes, either as representing collections or their use of prints as comparative material within the discourse, but Vermeulen goes far beyond this. The books by Haskell (London 1987), Palmer and Frangenberg (Aldershot 2003), Krause, Niehr and Hanebutt-Benz (Leipzig 2005), or Weissert (Stuttgart PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="6">NOTES 433 1994) and Weissert (Berlin 1999) remain interesting as part of the history of research, but Vermeulen wanted to show how eighteenth-century scholars pictured the past. She examines four basic questions: first, which images were considered appropriate for examination in this discourse; second, how collections of prints, drawings or illustrated books were ordered and used to discover ordering principles; third, how the collection history relates to the historiography of art in general; and fourth - a major topic in print and collecting theory - how trustworthy the printed images were and what status they had in issues of connoisseurship. These four topics are, admittedly, huge. The material Vermeulen uses comes from many books and draws togeth- er a wide range of visual sources. Using three case studies she examines the books by Giovanni Bottari, Winckelmann and d'Agincourt and the collections they used. These authors included both prints and drawings to reach their conclusions and made extensive use of printmaking to argue their respective cases. Very convincingly, Vermeulen links the change in the his- toriography of art to the change in the use of collections, and not to a linear development of artist biographies. She divides her thesis into two main sections: the first, 'Revealing the History of Art in Paper Collections', and the second, 'Illustrating the History of Art in Books'. Each contains two chapters, which link the case study of d'Agincourt in the third chapter to a final examination of 'The Rise of the Illustrated Art History Book'. This chapter probably con- tains Vermeulen's greatest achievement and has most poten- tial for further development. The connections that she makes between collecting practice and publications, and the close relationship of print and drawing collections for the development of ideas and understanding of the historical past, deserve further examination. Vermeulen's comments are far superior to anything yet published, although an initial step was taken by Stephan Brakensiek in his book Vom 'Theatrum Mundi ' zum e Cabinet des Estampes . . .', on collecting prints in Germany (see Print Quarterly , xxi, 2004, pp. 190-93). What is now needed, as a common target, is to intensify research in this direction. It will take time, but in the end will hopefully uncover new rôles and functions of prints after other artworks in the late eighteenth century Vermeulen has made important progress, and with her three case studies and her observa- tions on the rise of the illustrated art book she has opened up a new field. For this alone, she should be congratulated. So far only her first chapter will be published, but for the sake of print scholarship one hopes that she will find a suitable way of making her results available to a wider public. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN DIGHTON. Robert Dighton (1751-1814) was a draughts- man trained at the Royal Academy and is most interesting as the foremost designer of satirical 'drolls'. These are cheap, often hand-coloured, humorous mezzotints, typified by the print A Real Scene in St Paul's Church Tard, on a Windy Day pub- lished by Carington Bowles (1724-92), after a watercolour in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Later in his career Dighton also etched satirical, faintly caricatured por- trait prints of well-known figures and characters such as The Specious Orator ; showing James Christie wielding his gavel. The format of these portraits, usually a single figure full- length in profile, is unmistakable and is comparable to the later formulaic chromolithograph portraits in Vanity Fair. Dighton began his career as a portrait painter and draw- ing master, issuing A Book of Heads , the frontispiece featuring an elegant, profile self-portrait (drawing in the National Portrait Gallery, London) holding a full portfolio under his arm and gripping a porte-crayon , one of the tools of his trade. In 1779 a set of mezzotints was published by William Richardson after Dighton's designs of actors and actresses, hinting at his additional talents in acting and singing, for he appeared regularly at theatres in Covent Garden and at Sadler's Wells. As a watercolourist Dighton was clearly tal- ented, and his most ambitious work in this medium was three large-scale, multi-figure paintings of the Westminster Elections of 1784 (Royal Collection, Windsor), 1788 and 1796 (Museum of London), all featuring Charles James Fox. These were recently discussed by Mark Bills in The Art of Satire: London in Caricature (London 2006, pp. 100-02). In a new book on the Dighton dynasty by David Padbury, A View of Dightons: The Dighton Family : Their Times, Caricatures and Portraits (London, The Cartoon Museum, 2007, 108 pp., 114 col. and 2 b. &amp; w. ills., £14.99), the author includes at the back a list of 'The Collected Works of the Dighton Family'. Unfortunately it is not very good. An Election Scene at Covent Garden is curiously dated 1782. We are told it is a watercolour and we are directed to the Dorothy George British Museum catalogue, BM8815A - and that is all. For some of the entries we are given dimensions, for others not. Nowhere are we supplied with the basic vital information that defines a print, such as the publisher's name, address, or the precise date of publication. The book plods along chronologically, barely even dis- cussing the distinctive genre of 'drolls' (typically advertised as 'whimsical, satirical and burlesque subjects (but not polit- ical)'), which were issued profusely, particularly in the 1770s and 1780s, and featured in the successive stocklists of such prominent publishers as Bowles &amp; Carver, Sayer &amp; Bennett and Laurie &amp; Whittle. There is only a brief mention of similar 'droll' artists such as John Collett (d. 1780) or Isaac Cruikshank (1764-1811). The latter produced abundant watercolour designs for Laurie &amp; Whittle, and the surviving substantial group of drawings in the Huntington Library, San Marino, CA (see R. Wark, Isaac Cruikshank's " Drawings for Drolls (San Marino, CA 1968), and Isaac Cruikshank and the Politics of Parody , (San Marino, CA 1994) make a fascinating comparison with the large Bowles group by Dighton pre- served in an album, sold in 1953 and dispersed in a Sotheby's sale on 23 February 1978. This group was the ostensible rea- son for the book by Dennis Rose, Life, Times and Recorded Works of Robert Dighton (1 752-1814) Actor, Artist and Printseller and three of his Artist Sons: Portrayers of Georgian Pageantry and Wit (Tisbury 1981). Robert Dighton was the father of three artists: Robert Jr (1786-1865), Denis (1791-1827) and Richard (1796-1880). PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200 J, 4</page><page sequence="7">434 NOTES Brief chapters with dry biographical details are devoted to each. All of Dighton's sons produced 'correct likenesses' in a similar vein to their father, which are today largely appreci- ated for their historical and biographical value. Robert Jr was essentially a soldier and most of his output is of military subjects and portraits of officers in their uniforms. Denis also specialized in battle scenes, and 'From 1817 until 1828 Richard Dighton produced over one hundred etchings of city and west-end personalities, actors, bankers, diplomats, merchants, politicians and aristocrats' (p. 68). Richard is also interesting for his provincial work in Cheltenham and Worcester. Padbury includes details of a third generation of artists: Richard Dighton Jr (1823-91) and Joshua Dighton (1831-1908). Richard also settled in Cheltenham and practised as a portrait painter and then photographer, while Joshua specialized in sporting portraits, particularly of jockeys. Padbury, an enthusiast and collector of Dighton's work, also retreads the sad episode of Dighton supplementing his income by stealing prints from the British Museum, and the discovery of this in 1806. Under the chapter 'Light Fingers at the British Museum' the author transcribes the documents published in Landmarks in Print Collecting , edited by Antony Griffiths (London 1996, Appendix E, pp. 276-83). No print is illustrated with Dighton's disfiguring collector's stamp (Lugt 727), which would have made plain his blatant thiev- ery. SIMON TURNER PRINT SOURCES ON THE INTERNET The recent Note in Print Quarterly on the usefulness of the Bath Chronicle , highlighted the importance of web-based resources for print research (Print Quarterly , xxrv, 2007, p. 158). It is worth draw- ing attention to some other helpful sources. The nature of the information that can be found may be illustrated by using the search term, 'printseller', and focussing on the period 1750-1850. Other terms, such as 'copper plate engraver', may also provide valuable results. Three of these resources take the form of full text search- es, where it is possible to search for any word within the orig- inal publication. These are The Times and the London Gazette , which are displayed on screen in their original format, and the Proceedings of the Old Bailey , which takes the form of a com- plete transcript. The other resources are searchable data- bases and therefore searches are limited to the range of terms indexed. The Times Digital Archive is a searchable resource cov- ering The Times between 1785 and 1985. It can be viewed on- line at http: / / www. galeuk.com/times/ on payment, or free of charge through many libraries, either at the library with- out registration or remotely in many cases upon registration with the library. A search between 1785 and 1850 of 'printseller' produces 259 hits. The same date search with 'print seller' produces 57 hits, also of interest. These are mainly advertisements, including many by Edward Orme of Bond Street, printseller to the King, announcing new pub- lished material. One advertisement describes new transpar- ent prints, to be 'fitted up to Windows and Window Blinds to imitate the painted glass' (12 November 1801). There are also interesting news articles: for instance, there is a notice of the public subscription for the erection of a statue in the memory of William Woollett, engraver to the King (20 May 1791)- The London Gazette , the government-published newspaper, has been digitized and can be searched between 1752 and 1998 at http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/index.asp? webTvpe=o. This provides a valuable source of information about business partnerships and bankruptcy proceedings. A 'print seller' search between 1752 and 1850 produces 192 results. The majority of these are bankruptcy notices, including Joshua Evans (25 November 1842) Samuel Gowar (29 November 1839) and John Kendrick (19 December 1834). A search using the plural, 'print sellers', reveals information on business partnerships. Searching for specific individuals also gives good results. For instance, the partnership between James Whittle and Robert Laurie was dissolved in 1812, when the latter retired. James Whitde and Richard Holmes Laurie, son of Robert Laurie, then continued the business of map and chart sellers, Fleet Street (11 August 1812). It is pos- sible to track successive events relating to a single person. On 21 July 1835 the partnership between James Anthony Molteno and Francis Graves, print sellers of 20 Pall Mall, was dissolved by mutual consent. On 30 August 1836 Molteno was found to be insolvent and unable to pay his creditors and on 16 September 1836 he was declared bank- rupt. It is also possible to search the Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes. The Proceedings of the Old Bailey contains 101,102 accounts of trials held from 1674 to 1834 at London's Central Criminal Court. These can be searched at http: //www. oldbailevon- line.org/ and give an unusual insight into the non-elite who are rarely recorded elsewhere. A search of 'printseller' (note, omitting the space gives more direct results) produces eleven items between 1750 and 1850, including an instance where Thomas Sutherland confessed to the theft of books from Rudolph Akerman (sic), printseller of the Strand, and Peter Brown was then indicted for receiving the stolen goods on 2 June 1813.

CHLOE EVANS THE COAST IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY BRITAIN. It is strange that until recent years artists' repre- sentations of the coast of Britain have received little atten- tion from art historians. Christiana Payne's Where the Sea meets the Land : Artists on the Coast in Nineteenth-century Britain (Bristol, Sansom &amp; Co., 2007, 216 pp., 94 col. and 18 b. &amp; w. ills., £29.95) is the first book on the subject. Marine painting has received attention as a significant genre for British artists from the eighteenth century onwards, but it has been left to specialists and has been seldom related to the mainstream in historical studies. The same is true in accounts of British marine printmaking. This book, too, largely leaves marine art on the margins. Thus the early nineteenth-century con- tinuation of the practice of depicting specific ships against recognizable features of the British shoreline falls outside the scope of this volume. Payne, however, certainly establishes that coastal art deserves separate attention, although it is allied both to landscape and genre painting. Following an introductory essay on the sea in poetry and in the writings of Ruskin, chapters are devoted to different sub-genres. Thus one finds sections on the breakers and sky, the coast as fron- tier, tourism, the natural history of the shoreline, wrecks and lighthouses and the fishing community. The book is essen- tially about English art. The Irish and Welsh contributions are completely neglected. Scottish artists are represented by the token figures of William McTaggart, William Dyce and William Bell Scott. There is no mention of such painters as Alexander Nasmyth, John Wilson, Rev. John Thomson of Duddingston, Colin Hunter, Peter Graham, Robert McGregor or R. W. Allan. Hunter and Allan's etched work includes works that fall within the topics covered in this volume. Refreshing attention is paid to Henry Moore and James Clark Hook, and many of the remarks about the latter's paintings could be applied to his etchings, which, however, are unmentioned here. The volume concentrates essentially on painting and hardly touches at all on sculpture, but it does intermittently engage with neglected areas of British printmaking history. The most notable of these are the colour wood-engravings (here described as chromolithographs) of Philip Henry Gosse, the naturalist and popularizer of science, remem- bered today as the fundamentalist father in Edmund Gosse 's autobiography, Father and Son. From the evidence of the strik- ing illustrations to his own The Aquarium of 1854 and Actinologia Britannica : A History of the British Sea - Anemones and Corals of i860, the elder Gosse had considerable talent as a draughtsman. These prints by William Dickes (1815-92), based on Gosse 's own watercolours, must have played a part in the development of his son's ability as a sympathetic crit- ic of British contemporary sculpture. Gosse's emphasis on the brilliant colours and markings found in the natural world, as Payne notes, contrasts with the more scientific and matter-of-fact approach of his great contemporary, Charles Darwin. She also thinks that his illustrations have a hint of the sexual innuendo that was often displayed in contempo- rary representations of human life on the beach. Examples of this by John Leech and Richard Doyle are found here. Another unfamiliar figure to art history is the Orcadian Thomas Webster, who studied architecture and designed the lecture theatre of the impressive Neo-classical Royal Institution of Great Britain in London. Webster was an associate of John Varley and was also a member of the Sketching Society. He pursued a parallel career as a geolo- gist, which, after a period as Curator of the Geological Society of London, culminated in his appointment as Professor of Geology at University College, London. Webster provided the professional expertise for Sir Henry Englefield's handsome volumes, A Description of the Principal Beauties, Antiquities, and Geological Phenomena of the Isle of Wight , of 181 6. The Scotsman's texts and plates are discussed here. What is not mentioned is that his drawings were engraved by the brothers William Bernard and George Cooke, who worked as illustrators on a number of volumes that included coastal scenery, most notably Turner's Views in Sussex of 1819 and his Picturesque Views of the South Coast of England of 1826, a project on which Turner embarked on the Cookes' commis- sion. Payne indeed illustrates Cooke's engraving of Turner's Lulworth Cove , in which the artist drew in detail the contort- ed strata of the rocky headland in the foreground. She also reminds us of Turner's friendship with the geologist John MacCulloch. William Bernard Cooke had earlier in 1808 published his A New Picture of the Isle of Wight with Thirty-six Plates after his own design. In an attempt to raise the status of engravers and to establish a more direct contact with patrons and collectors, he organized a series of exhibitions at 9 Soho Square, two of which, in 1821 and 1823, featured engravings some of which were of coastal scenery. The first of these shows received the patronage of King George IV Much better known to scholars is William Daniell's Voyage Round Great Brìtain, which includes a few plates demonstrat- ing geological interests. When the artist took over the com- mentary from the original author, Richard Ayton, he expressed his belief in the generosity of the deity in creating the wonders of Staffa, as well as quoting from John MacCulloch, a serious scientific authority. Both Daniell's and Turner's interest in the coastal defences erected on the southern coast to meet the threat of a possible Napoleonic invasion are discussed here, as are their depiction of light- houses. Payne notes the dedication of the first volume of Daniell's Voyage to 'the master and assistant of the corpora- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="9">436 NOTES tion of Trinity House', and reasonably suggests that he hoped to get financial support from Trinity House for the continuation of his project. From the last third of the eighteenth century the drama of shipwreck and rescue frequendy provided subject-matter for exhibits at the Royal Academy and other artistic societies. These were often also interpreted in prints. Sometimes, as was the case for Gillray's The Nancy Packet , these were fully independent works in their own right. From De Loutherbourg onwards, shipwreck themes found expression in the theatre, in panoramas, novels and poetry The 1804 founding of the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck led to a century of improvements in lifeboats and safety equipment. The Cooke family of engravers and painters not only included a representation of a rescue by the Tynemouth Life-boat in their Views of Ports and Harbours, Watering Places, Fishing Villages, and other Picturesque Objects on the English Coast of 1838, but were also actively engaged in improving lifesaving - E. W. Cooke collected money to finance a lifeboat. Scenes of rescue appeared frequently in the wood-engraved illustrations of Victorian journals, and it is quite conceivable, as has been suggested, that these formed part of the impetus for the American painter and printmaker, Winslow Homer, to settle at the village of Cullercoats, where he worked from August 1881 to November 1883. This was the coasdine initially made famous for sea rescue by the heroism of the youthful Grace Darling and her father William, keeper of the Longstone lighthouse. The coast of the north-east and the shallows of the Goodwin Sands off Ramsgate frequently provided subjects for artistic representation. E. W. Cooke was one of the most productive etchers of the English coast, publishing Twelve Plates of Coast Sketches : Brighton in 1830 and The British Coast in 1831, as well as including a number of coastal prints in his Fifty Plates of Shipping and Craft of 1829. Payne discusses his work as a painter, but not these etchings. Other subjects popular for wood-engraved illustration both in serious and humorous journals included the behav- iour of the growing number of holiday visitors to the south coast. Rowlandson was the highly influential pioneer of the topic. Seaside behaviour as found in Richard Doyle's Bird's Eye Views of Society of 1864 even found echoes across the Channel in the etchings of the Belgian printmaker James Ensor. Of English extraction, he clearly was fascinated by British illustration and caricature. Another aspect of beach life, the boats on the beach and the daily work of fisher folk, provided further inspiration for printmakers. Cornelius Varley 's Etchings of Shipping, Barges, Fishing Boats and other Vessels Met with on the Brìtish Coast, Rivers &amp;c. of 1809 included some beach scenes, and this publication was followed by the soft- ground etchings of Samuel Prout of Deal, of c. 18 16. Robert Dixon, Joseph Stannard and John Cantiloe Joy were among Norwich artists who etched the East Anglian coast. Subjects included the jetties at Yarmouth, Gorleston and Cromer. Those interested in Norwich School etchers, shipping and the sea can search the Norwich Castie Museum's holdings artist by artist at http: / / www.culturalmodes.norfolk.gov.uk/ default.asp?Document=300.20.040. Later in the century Charles Keene, whose connection with the Norwich School deserves investigation, was attract- ed to the coast around Dunwich and Southwold as a subject for etching. Artists working on the Norfolk and Suffolk coast are rather neglected here. Occasionally a maritime event attracted an artist, most notably the display at Spithead in July 1887 for Queen Victoria's Jubilee Naval Review, in cel- ebration of which the American Whistler etched a group of twelve small plates in front of the motif to present to the monarch. The minimalism of these delicate plates contrasts strongly with his earlier etching of Hastings, which is much more assimilable within the main tradition of Victorian rep- resentations of coastal towns. Similar deviation from the norm can be seen in Sickert's etching of the beach at Scheveningen. Exploration of French and Dutch influences on British coastal art of the first and last thirds of the nine- teenth century could have been pursued further, martin hopkinson JULES MICHELIN. Three large collections of the prints of the mid-nineteenth century French landscape artist, Jules Michelin, have enabled Pierre Sanchez to put together a comprehensive catalogue of his work {Jules Michelin (i8iy-i8yo): Graveur et collectionneur. Catalogue raisonné de son œuvre gravé et lithographié , Dijon, L'Echelle de Jacob, 2007, 224 pp., 24 col. and 105 b. &amp; w. ills., €85). Foremost of these is that of Hubert Prouté and his wife. For Paul Prouté assem- bled over 100 sheets, many of them proofs, impressions on different papers and impressions bearing annotations. Michelin was one of the printmakers collected by the New York dealer and collector, Samuel Avery, who put together a high quality collection of contemporary French prints, now housed in New York Public Library. The third repository is that of the Musée National Adrien Dubouché at Limoges. Some of the 60 impressions held there were deposited by the art critic Philippe Burty. The provenance of the rest has still to be established, but it is a fair assumption that Dubouché, a partner in a family cognac business, Director of the Limoges museum from 1865 and founder of an art school in his home town, who was a friend of Michelin, owned the majority of them. He was a notable collector of Oriental and European porcelain, an enthusiasm that he shared with the artist. Over 200 lots of ceramics appeared in the sale of Michelin's collection held at the Hotel Drouot, 21-23 April 1898. The catalogue to this sale provided an additional resource for Sanchez, who notes that it includes three etch- ings and a lithograph after Hippolyte Ballue, impressions of which are yet to be found. This catalogue records eight lith- ographs, 50 intaglio prints and one engraving after his design. Four of the lithographs are encompassed in just two entries, as they were executed and published as pairs. Michelin's career is discussed in a very thorough intro- duction by Valérie Sueur-Hermel. A pupil of Camille Roqueplan and Charles Ramelet, both lithographers, Michelin first exhibited in public with drawings and pastels. His debut as a printmaker was in lithography, in which doubtiess he owed much to Roqueplan. Eight of his land- scape lithographs were published between 1847 and 1852 by PRINT QUARTERLY, XX IV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="10">NOTES 437 L'Artiste , which in 1846 had published an engraving by Thomas Taylor after his design. These are very much in the Barbizon tradition. Sueur-Hamel refers to Jules Dupré, Louis Français, Théodore Rousseau, Louis Marvy and Camille Arnaud as points of comparison. Michelin's œuvre was never to stray far from this vein. He made his first etch- ing, a view near Arras, in 1848. The location makes one wonder if he had contact with the thriving school of land- scape painters and printmakers based in that town, almost all of whom were close to Corot. Michelin made no further print until 1857. This was of a rare non-French subject, the etching Peel's Park, Manchester. In reality this is Peel Park, Salford. Not mentioned here is the fact that its existence surely means that Michelin came to England to see the famous Art Treasures' exhibition. It is often forgotten that this show included over 3,000 prints. Sueur-Hamel compares the etching with those of Seymour Haden, whom she suggests that he met during this visit. It is very likely that they were friends. Michelin owned 30 high quality impressions of the Englishman's prints, two of which bear dedications to him from Haden. The prices for Haden's etchings in this sale remind us just how highly French connoisseurs valued his work up to the end of the nineteenth century. An impression of A By-road in Tipperary fetched 1,320 francs and another of Shere Mill Pond , 920 francs. Michelin also owned an early impression on Japan paper of Whistler's The Pool, doubtless obtained from Haden. However, Michelin's prints provide no evidence that he studied the American's etchings. He also owned an etch- ing and a lithograph by Bonington and a number of prints after this artist. Peel Park beside the Irwell, just north of Manchester, is one of the very earliest public parks in the world and opened in 1846. It also houses one of the earliest English provincial public museums. The Free Museum and Library opened in 1849, and a south wing was added in the year of Michelin's etching, when it was visited by Prince Albert. Also in that year a statue of Queen Victoria by Matthew Noble was unveiled in the park. Like many of his contemporaries, Michelin turned to Auguste Delâtre to print this Lancashire etching and many subsequent plates. The bulk of his intaglio prints date from 1 86 1 to 1870, the year of his death. Michelin's landscapes were taken from Normandy, the Ile de Seine, the Forest of Fontainebleau, Vichy and the Auvergne. The countryside in the vicinity of Montgéron, south-east of Paris, was a favourite subject. Occasionally Michelin etched the designs of others, such as a landscape near The Hague after Auguste-Clément-Joseph Herst, and a Franciscan monk in Rome after Eugène Maison. There is no evidence that he visited Holland or Italy. In 1863 Cadart published a collec- tion of sixteen of Michelin's etchings and a frontispiece, to which four more plates were added in a second edition of 1866. Two of his etchings were issued in 1868 in Edouard Lièvre's Le Musée Universel, avec les concours des artistes et des écrivains les plus distingués , a publication that included prints by Daubigny, Jacque, Jacquemart, the English aristocrat George Howard and others. Michelin also etched a few cartes de visite and the favourite dog of his friend, Genèviève Fuchs. He owned Bodmer's Animaux et Paysages , twenty etchings by Bracquemond, 39 by another Barbizon-style landscapist, Théophile Chauvel, a number of which were dedicated to Michelin, fifteen by Corot, 48 by Daubigny, over 50 by Jacque, 42 by Jacquemart, eleven by Jongkind and ten by Meryon. His drawings collection included examples of the work of Delacroix, Géricault, Huet, Troyon and Rousseau, as well as a small number by Old Masters, the most unex- pected being a pen drawing of an Annunciation attributed to Schongauer. Also published here is a list of paintings, drawings and etchings that Michelin exhibited at the Salon between 1844 and 1870. This includes works rejected by the jury of the 1863 Salon. In addition, there is a relatively brief bibliogra- phy, as well as a genealogy tracing the artist's descent from Jean Michelin, 'écuyer, conseiller et sécrétaire du Roi' (1700-85). For those for whom the name Michelin means tyres, there is a short essay on Jules Michelin's sons André and Edouard, who founded the firm based in Clermont- Ferrand that eventually became Michelin et Cie. martin HOPKINSON PRINT COLLECTIONS IN BREMEN. The Kunsthalle in Bremen is one of the few German institutions founded by the citizens of a town as an association to sup- port fine arts. It began with temporary exhibitions, but soon acquired important donations of paintings and sculpture, and with the bequest of Hieronymus Klugkist, some major paintings by Dürer and Altdorfer, among others, as well as large holdings of Diirer's prints and 47 of his watercolours and drawings. These works were the foundation of the Department of Prints and Drawings and a starting point for continued development. Later nineteenth-century additions included an extensive collection of Rembrandt etchings from the businessman Johann Heinrich Albers and several thousand Italian prints from Dr Melchior Hermann Segelken. This tradition of important donations continued after the turn of the century, when Hermann Henrich Meier Jr (1845-1905), a successful businessman, bequeathed his col- lection of more than 60,000 prints, to be followed by twenty paintings in 1924 after his wife's death. Another addition to the print holdings was a smaller collection of some 440 sheets and 45 books brought together by Friedrich Perzynski for Heinrich Wiegand, a director of Norddeutsche Lloyd. A recent exhibition in Bremen celebrated these two different collections, which complement each other in their focus and importance for print collecting in the early 1900s in Germany (Anne Röver-Kann and Andreas Kreul, Altes, Neues, Allerneuestes - Sammeln um igoo. Eine Ausstellung zu Ehren von H. H. Meier jr. und Heinrìch Wiegand in der Kunsthalle Bremen , Bremen, Kunsthalle, 20 February-i April 2007, Bremen, Hachmannedition, 2007, 127 pp., 319 col. and 147 b. &amp; w. ills., €25). An exhibition catalogue cannot, of course, present the full range of the two collectors' interests as well as outstanding individual examples. In the case of Meier, the show includ- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="11">43Ö NOTES ed prints by C allot and many eighteenth-century printmak- ers in wonderfully fresh impressions, but mostly it presented the nineteenth-century painter printmakers. The catalogue by Röver-Kann reflects this extremely well. She groups the Old Masters together, including all prints before 1800, but focusses on French engravers. She also illustrates important prints from other countries or printmakers, such as Canaletto's views of Dresden, some works by William Hogarth and a considerable number of crayon-style prints or series by Chodowiecki. However, the more important section was the nineteenth- century prints. These, too, are grouped intelligently and accordingly to their importance within the collection. They start with German painter etchers from C. D. Friedrich to Max Liebermann, including Meier's contemporaries in considerable number, and comprising, for example, Max Klinger's entire oeuvre ¡ as well as large holdings of Stauffer- Bern, Wilhelm Leibi and Max Liebermann. The next group consists of German lithographs from Schadow to Kollwitz, again ranging from Romanticism to Meier's own contempo- raries. This structure is repeated for French printmaking, starting with painter printmakers, this time from Corot to Chahine, and including every artist one might expect, such as Braquemond, Corot, Delacroix, Manet, Meryon, Millet, Camille Pissarro and James Tissot. Like their German coun- terparts, these artists are often represented in the catalogue by just a few examples, but previous shows have demon- strated that the holdings of Meier's collection in the Kunsthalle are much larger than might be assumed from this overview. The next group, similar to the German one, is dedicated to French lithography and woodcuts, followed by a group representing British and American printmakers from around 1900 and a small but fine group of prints by Munch and Anders Zorn. So far the catalogue has been dedicated to fine prints, which is unlikely to surprise many collectors or museum professionals. However, the next two groups turn this show into something much more challenging, and for such an institution, quite unexpected. They are dedicated to colour printmaking both in lithography and woodcut, and to applied graphics such as posters, publicity, covers, brochures and many other applications of printmaking in the early 1900s. It is surprising to see this rather large amount of material displayed and set into the context of an otherwise fine collection of prints. Nevertheless, it shows how wide-ranging Meier's interests were, and what can nowadays be made of such a collection. Very commendably, Röver-Kann decided to dedicate a large part of the catalogue to this frequently neglected mate- rial. Although Meier's other prints are often high quality, pristine or rare impressions, his importance as a collector is probably best seen in the context of colour prints. He was, as Röver-Kann points out, mainly interested in document- ing the printmaking of his time, and applied printmaking was an important cultural aspect. She does not try to sum- marize everything, but concentrates on Meier's particular interests and how these groups of prints form a coherent col- lection. She has drawn on Meier's collection in the past for many exhibitions and will continue to do so, but with such a comprehensive overview, the quality that he expected becomes evident, and his range of interests, especially in contemporary printmaking, as well as his intention of sup- porting the Museum he chaired for many years. His achieve- ments as President of the Kunstverein were remarkable. Although Wiegand's activities were much narrower in scope, these comments apply also to them. A contemporary of Meier's, Wiegand had paid for a lengthy research trip to Japan by the young art historian, Friedrich Perzynski, and equipped him with funds to acquire prints. Originally, half of these were intended to come to the Museum and the other half to become Wiegand's private collection. After Perzynski returned to Bremen, however, Wiegand decided to donate all the prints to the Museum. Andreas Kreul's essay on this subject is much shorter than Röver-Kann's, but is nevertheless stimulating and informative about collecting non-European prints in Germany at that time. The two essays, and especially the catalogue with its many illustrations and some basic information, give an idea of the range of the Museum's collection, its quality and the fasci- nation that these sheets must have had for contemporaries. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN GEORGE BELLOWS. Accompanying the Boston Public Library's travelling exhibition, a well-presented catalogue, The Powerful Hand of George Bellows: Drawings from the Boston Public Library (Robert Conway, Washington DC, Trust for Museum Exhibitions, 2007, 160 pp., 85 b. &amp; w. ills., $35.00) reproduces 48 drawings by Bellows with detailed notes and information on materials and accession. Guest Curator Robert Conway's short essay, A Distinction Between Fancy and Imagination: Learning from the Drawings of George Bellows', seeks to establish the drawings as a discrete body of work to be positioned alongside, rather than in subordinate relation to, Bellows' paintings and lithographs. While the assumption that drawings are simply preparatory for work in other media is successfully negotiated, the assertion that '[The drawings] are not related to the prints as much as the prints are related to them' (p. 22) remains, inevitably, speculative. Conway acknowledges that Bellows was accomplished in both drawing and lithography, but then asserts that, when viewed alongside the corresponding drawing, 'the later print pales in comparison to its source' (p. 23). This amounts to a preference for the subtle shading effects and fine detail of the drawings over the distinct qualities of Bellows' lithography. Conway is not alone in expressing this preference. Reviewing the exhibition of the artist's graphic work mount- ed by Keppel Galleries just prior to Bellows' death in 1925, Henry McBride noted instances of 'the immense artistic superiority of the drawing over the lithograph' ('Bellows Lithographs on View', New York Sun , 28 March 1925, p. 13). Having previously recommended the lithograph Dempsey and Firpo (1923-24) to readers as 'a good buy', McBride explained that the 'glassy, unreal look' of Dempsey's body and other traits that marred the print were not present in the drawing. Like several of the reviewers cited in The Powerful PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="12">NOTES 439 Hand, , whether writing during Bellows' lifetime or in the later 1920s and 1930s when Keppel and other galleries continued to display the drawings, McBride treats them as part of the oeuvre and as a subject worthy of individual consideration. This critical practice supports Conway's argument that historical contingencies, rather than the intrinsic value of the work, have led to a lack of emphasis on the drawings in recent assessments of Bellows' career. It is suggested that while the paintings - through high profile exhibition - and the lithographs - through reproduction - have been kept in the public eye, the drawings have been overlooked. However, from the mild controversy surrounding the boxing paintings of 1907-09, to the creation of widely reproduced lithographs of major sporting events such as Dempsey and Firpo, Bellows consistently operated as a highly public artist. Both he and his work thrived in the context of public exhi- bition and audience reception. It might therefore be argued that the small-scale, relatively private medium of crayon, graphite and ink works on paper did not best fit the per- sonality and intentions of the artist - at least as they are currently understood. Reintroducing the drawings as a significant yet neglected element of his work would, then, appear to require a re-eval- uation of our understanding of Bellows as an artist. It is thus unfortunate that the exhibition tide, 'The Powerful Hand of George Bellows', is so firmly positioned within the constella- tion of critical terms - raw, strenuous, vigorous - that have long been associated with Bellows' art. In oil on canvas Bellows' energetic paint handling, bold coloration and sheer scale of composition provide some justification for a language of force and power, but the delicate touch exhibit- ed in drawings such as Sixteen East Gay Street (1923) seem to demand a different approach. The floral trellis, strolling people and airy spaces of this work display the lightness and sentimentality common to many of Bellows' late images of family and home life. Both the exhibition tide and Conway's essay, in which a significant portion of the analysis follows from Michael Quick's discussion of dynamic symmetry and other compositional theories, tend to position Bellows' drawings within existing paradigms rather than establishing a vocabulary specific to the unique qualities of the work. The exception, and one of the strengths of the catalogue, is the attention paid to the status of the drawings as illustra- tions. In the essay and, more fulsomely in the notes accom- panying the individual reproductions, a picture emerges of Bellows accepting commissions, utilizing photographic sources and designing images specifically to corroborate and dramatize the accompanying text. Of Bellows' illustration for a 1 9 15 article about the evangelist Billy Sunday, Conway observes: 'Preaching is another excellent example of Bellows' ability to blend caricature and journalistic illustra- tion. While the faces of the potential converts in the front row are quick cartoon sketches, the figure of Sunday in action is remarkably faithful to photos of him in his trade- mark poses, leaping forward to deliver his message' (p. 62). John Sloan and the other Ashcan School artists who began their careers as sketch reporters provide the obvious point of reference for Bellows' illustration work. But the qualities of legibility and quick characterization identified here, as well as the attendant danger of static composition, seem more closely related to the work of the dedicated magazine illustrators of the 1910s such as F. R. Gruger and Henry Raleigh. While not fully developed, Conway's analysis establishes good grounds for further discus- sion of Bellows' involvement in the practices of commercial illustration, , JOHN FAGG ROBERTO MELLI. The recently opened Museo Pericle Fazzini, housed in the Palazzo del Capitano del Perdono in Santa Maria degli Angeli near Assisi, has a policy of staging exhibitions of the work of contemporaries of the 'wind sculp- tor' Pericle Fazzini. The latest in this series has been a show of works on paper by the Ferrara painter and sculptor, Roberto Melli, which was accompanied by the catalogue Roberto Melli : opere dal igoj al igj6 (Rome, De Luca Edizioni d'Arte, 2007, 62 pp., 60 col. and 5 b. &amp; w. ills., €12), with an essay by Lea Mattarella. Melli is probably best known today as a writer. He was one of the founders in 1918 with Mario Broglio, Carrà and De Chirico of the journal Valori Plastici. A poet as well as an artist, he became a leading art critic, being particularly noted for his contributions in the 1930s in Quadrìvio championing the work of young Rome-based painters and sculptors, and from 1957 in II Paese. In 1933 he signed the Manifesto del Primordialismo Plastico with the painters Emanuele Cavalli and Giuseppe Capogrossi. Melli's mature style, a stripped Realism not unlike that of Casorati in spirit, was formed in the years immediately fol- lowing World War I. This, however, was far from his begin- nings. At the age of seventeen in 1902 Melli moved with his family to Genoa, where he was apprenticed to a wood carver. It was there that he made his first woodcuts. He became the principal contributor to Ebe , the journal found- ed by Luigi Sanguinetti in nearby Chiavari. Melli's prints were among the most innovative of any young Italian artists during this period of woodcut revival, standing out from their contemporaries for what Giubbini has described as their 'antigrazioso' manner. He completely rejected the prevalent Renaissance revival style, as well as all hints of Art Nouveau and the Austrian Secession. Melli filled every inch of his blocks with lines. Many of his early woodcuts resem- ble metal plaquettes. His style is said to have been formed through the study of Coptic and Ethiopian art, Ottonian manuscripts and early mediaeval reliefs. Melli's form of Expressionism, also found in his sculpture, can be compared with the slightiy later work of the young Arturo Martini. Just two examples of his early prints are included here, whetting the appetite for further investigation. In 1910 Melli moved to Rome, where in 19 13 he became a leading member of the Secessione Romana. Two years later he was one of the founders of the Gruppo Moderno Italiano. Melli is one of many significant Italian artists on whom key publications seem not to have reached major libraries in Britain. Doubtless much more about his printmaking can be found in Giuseppe Appella's catalogue to the Palazzo Ricci, Macerata, exhibition in 1992, Roberto Melli 1 885-1 gj8, a copy of which this writer has not yet seen, martin hopkinson PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="13">440 NOTES ADOLPHE VALETTE. The St Etienne-born painter Adolphe Valette is today remembered almost exclusively as the Master of Painting and Drawing at the Municipal School of Art, who had L. S. Lowry as one of his students in his life drawing classes. While his paintings have long been known in Manchester for their evocative representation of the smoky and misty industrial city in the first three decades of the last century, this sub-Impressionist artist whose work is sometimes comparable to Whistler, and at other times to the early pictures of J. D. Fergusson, is deserving of wider appreciation. A monograph by Cécilia Lyon, Adolphe Valette (Chichester, Phillimore &amp; Co. Ltd, 2006, 144 pp., 99 col. and 26 b. &amp; w. ills., £31.50) is the first study of his complete career. She acknowledges her debt to Sandra Martin, orga- nizer of two exhibitions devoted to the artist held in Manchester City Art Gallery in 1976 and 1994. In addition, Lyon has consulted the 1976 Manchester University under- graduate thesis by Elisabeth Lee, the first work written on the artist. Lyon's study reveals that, unknown to most print histori- ans, Valette was a printmaker with an œuvre of around 50 works. One of the earliest articles published on him, an obit- uary in 1942, bore the tide Adolphe Valette, peintre et graveur'. Indeed, one of the principal reasons for his atten- dance from the age of fifteen at St Etienne's Ecole Régionale des Arts Industriels is likely to have been to learn engraving, since both his father and grandfather worked in the arma- ments industry. The Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Guerre was one of the most important factories in the town. Jean Guichard, formerly Curator of the Musée des Armes, had founded and directed a specialist course on engraving at the Ecole Régionale des Beaux- Arts from 1884 to 1887. Lyon illustrates an engraving of a dog surprising a partridge, dated 25 September 1890 (?), a very competent work in the tradition of such sporting printmakers as Albert de Balleroy. Valette 's expertise was rewarded in 1893 when he was placed first in the engraving class at the Ecole Régionale des Arts Industriels. He moved on to further artistic training at the Ecole Municipale de Dessin de la Guillotière in Lyon in 1895 and to the Ecole Municipale de Beaux-Arts et des Arts Décoratifs in Bordeaux in 1900. A few early engravings were exhibited in Manchester in 1976. It is probable that in these years Valette supported himself through commercial work. During his time in Lyon he executed an etching of L'Ile Barbe, dated 11 May 1896, and while in Bordeaux he exhib- ited two drypoints at the autumn exhibition of the Salon des Artistes Girondins in 1904. An etching from 1903 of the flamboyant Gothic clock tower of the cathedral in Bordeaux, La Tour Pey-Berland, was included in the 1976 Manchester exhibition. By 1905 Vállete was established in Manchester, working for the printers Norbury Natzio &amp; Co. Ltd and studying in the evening at the Municipal School of Art. His talent was clearly apparent, as by early 1906 he had become the school's Master of Painting and Drawing. In 1909 the school established an etching class under Valette'» direction. A pho- tograph reproduced here shows him with some of his pupils and a newly acquired etching press. Also in 1909 Valette exhibited a couple of prints at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool's annual autumn exhibition, where he showed every year until 191 2. Later exhibits there included a dry- point and a coloured etching. A further coloured etching was exhibited at the Manchester-based Society of Modern Artists, of which Valette was a founder member. To judge by the illustrations in this book, his work was firmly in the Legros vein, but he is also known to have been an admirer of Forain. A striking etching of 1910 shows Job at prayer, but most of his prints were landscapes. Valette also executed aquatints and lithographs. He did some teaching of lithog- raphy and poster design at the School of Art. In 1918 a spe- cial room was assigned to etching and lithography at the school. The poster for the 1920 one-man show of Valette 's work at Finnigans, Deansgate, is indebted to Vallotton, an influence also sometimes visible in his pictures. The tones and hues of his pre-war work often evoke the world of the Nabis, particularly Denis. Valette also designed a poster for an exhibition of colour prints of unknown date at Finnigans. This dealer had given him his first one-man show in 1918, which included more than fifteen prints, among them a nude and two portraits. The second exhibition included seven etchings. Cattie as well as landscapes seem to have been his speciality. The only identified sites in these shows were the Alps and the church of St Séverin, Paris. However, he is also known to have executed lithographs of the beach at Llanddulas in North Wales and of Ludford Bridge in Ludlow. Some of his lithographs have been described as hand-coloured. In 1920 Valette gave up his post in Manchester, and the following year took a part-time position at Bolton Municipal School of Art. He also did some teaching at the Victoria University, Manchester, where his second wife, Andrée Pallez, was teaching French. Valette was appointed Master of Drawing there in 1921. He left Manchester in 1928. We do not know whether he continued to make prints. The last recorded here were in the 1922 exhibition. The Whitworth Art Gallery owns one of his etchings. Christie's South Kensington held two sales of Valette 's work on 19 November 1987 and 19 September 1991. The works all came from the Perera collection, which had been exhibited previously at the City of Salford Art Gallery in 1984. 1 have not yet found whether a catalogue or handlist exists. This collection included almost all Valette 's known prints, and these were dispersed in the 1987 sale. We know that one of Valette 's pupils and friends, the Preston painter Frank Greenwood, also a student of Frank Short, produced etchings of buildings in Manchester, many of which have now been demolished. MARTIN HOPKINSON DARAGNES. Although Jean-Gabriel Daragnès was one of the leading figures in French book illustration from 1920 until his death in 1950, his contribution to French art was rather neglected until 2001, when the Bibliothèque Municipale de Villeneuve mounted an exhibition devoted to him. This was accompanied by a little book published by Les Amis du Vieux Villeneuve-sur- Yonne. A second show PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="14">NOTES 44 1 has now been staged at the Musées de Sens, with a catalogue titled Jean-Gabriel Daragnès 1886-1950: un artiste du livre à Montmartre (Sens, Musées de Sens and Editions du Linteau, 2007, 126 pp., 114 col. and 4 b. &amp; w. ills., €25). This volume includes essays by Sylvie Ballestier-Radet, Virginie Garret and Peter Frank, as well as a memoir by Janine Warnod at the soirées of whose father, André, Daragnès was in frequent attendance. Daragnès himself hosted equally popular samedis in their apartment at 14 Avenue Junot in Montmartre, at which many of the leading writers, poets and publishers of the day were to be found. Short extracts from the reminis- cences of Daragnès are republished here from the writings of Pierre Mac Orlan, Jean Giraudoux, Colette, André Beucler and Léon-Paul Fargue. In addition, one finds here an essay of 1986 by the poet Baptiste-Marrey and Daragnès's own 'Sur l'illustration', originally published in Jean de Bosschère, L'Exposition 1937 et les artists à Paris (Arts Sciences Lettres, Paris 1937), which had been previously republished by Daragnès's widow in 1959 as Propos sur l'illustration. Daragnès was introduced to printmaking while working as an apprentice between 1900 and 1905 with the goldsmiths Christofle. This famous firm, founded in 1830, was at this period at the height of its fame as a supplier of luxury goods throughout Europe. Daragnès turned to painting in 1907, attending the atelier of Luc-Olivier Merson and the Académie Ferdinand Humbert. He had begun to make wood-engravings by 19 12, when he illustrated his first book, Les Mois by the poet Edward Montier. Two of his finest books came early in his career in 1918, both published by Léon Pichot. In Daragnès's illustrations to Baudelaire's translation of Poe, Le Corbeau, a resemblance can be dis- cerned with the early work of Gwen Raverat. One wonders if Eric Gill had seen this volume before he executed the prin- cipal wood-engraving for Autumn Moonlight in 1923. For the compositions in his prints for Henry Davray's translation of Oscar Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol , Daragnès turned for inspiration to Doré's London. The prison walls are stage- like and in style reminiscent of the set designs of Edward Gordon Craig. Of course, it is also evident from these chiaroscuro woodcuts that Daragnès was very conversant with the works of Laboureur and Lepère. He is known to have particularly admired Rowlandson, but he clearly cast an eye across the Channel at other English illustrators. There are parallels with such artists as Stephen Gooden. Daragnès's style for the rest of his career was predomi- nantly romantic, although on occasion he presented a quite different face, as in the cover illustration for Jules Renard's Poil de carotte of 1939, in which he pays homage to Masereel. His 1948 colour engravings for Paul Valéry 's Le cimitière marin: poème demonstrate his awareness of Atelier 17. In the 1940s he returned to The Ballad of Reading Gaol , this time using mez- zotint. Peter Frank compares the illustrations in this 1944 volume with the works of Van Gogh. After the war, working with André Clot, Daragnès, for the first and only time, used lithographs to illustrate a book, Francis Carco's Les jours et les nuits , for Editions Textes et Prétextes in 1946. Daragnès was artistic director for Georges Crès between 1918 and 1923, the year in which he took up the same posi- tion with Emile-Paul Frères. In 1919 he joined forces with the humorist illustrator, Gus Bofa, well-known for his con- tributions to Le Rire and Sourire, to found the Salon de l'Araignée in opposition to the Salon des Humoristes. The Salon was held in the Galerie Devambez, where its annual exhibitions included drawings, paintings, prints, manuscript writings, books and sculpture. Daragnès's promotion of French books led him to organize exhibitions in Buenos Aires and Mainz in 1920 and 192 1. In 1920, with the help of Pierre Mac Orlan and Charles Malassis, he created Editions de la Banderole. Three years later he set himself up at 57 bis Boulevard de Rochechouart, in the atelier of the intaglio printer, Roger Lacourière. Lacourière's wife ran the Editions de la Roseraie from the same address. For this publisher Daragnès illustrated Gérard de Nerval's translation of Goethe's Faust with engravings, etchings and woodcuts. He sold off his library in 1924 in order to build a house and atelier in Montmartre, close to the atelier of his great friend Demetrios Galanis. From 1928 Daragnès marked his editions with a flowering heart, which soon became famous. The huge respect that he enjoyed led to his selection as head of the section devoted to book illustration at the 1937 Paris International Exhibition. To coincide with this Daragnès published the volume Paris igjy, in which a host of distinguished printmakers partici- pated, including Matisse, Marquet, Dunoyer de Segonzac, Vlaminck, Friesz, Derain, Laboureur, Dufy, Bonnard, Vuillard, Goerg, Gromaire and Desvallières. The choice of writers was equally catholic. Daragnès's wife, Janine, played an important part in his workshop. She it was who approved the bon à tirer. After her husband's death in 1950 she contin- ued his imprint, publishing a number of volumes illustrated by his prints. Daragnès's paintings, which have as yet received little attention, owe most to Dunoyer de Segonzac. His Provençal landscapes place him in the circle of followers of Derain, such as Léopold-Levy. Some of Daragnès's gouaches could be compared with the early Parisian work of Antony Gross. In 1933 he was appointed official painter to the French Navy. Daragnès had acquired a taste for the sea as a very young man when he sailed to the Canaries and the Azores on a banana boat. His post took him across the Indian Ocean as far as Java and Indo-China. The resulting oils and gouach- es were translated in colour woodcuts to illustrate Terres chaudes , his own account of the voyage, published in 1940. Daragnès's one-man show at the Louvre in 1935 included 198 paintings. His single prints remain to be studied in depth. Most notable were the fourteen etchings that were published in the portfolio Jeux in 1935 by the Cinq- Vingt, a society of twenty print connoisseurs and five printmakers founded by the artist himself. The example illustrated here, a fine representation of a scrum-half passing the ball out from a ruck, included extensive use of a roulette. In all the society published ten albums, including another by Daragnès himself, Toreros. Dunoyer de Segonzac, Frélaut, Boussingault and André Villeboeuf were the other printmakers to produce portfolios.

The latest compilation to be published by Alan Wofsy Fine Arts is Fine Prints of the Year, A Complete Illustrated Index, by Malcolm C. Salaman and Campbell Dodgson (San Francisco, Alan Wofsy Fine Arts, 2006, 312 pp., 1,697 b. &amp; w- ilk-? $150). The prints illustrated in this annual review of contemporary etching and engrav- ing are all reproduced alphabetically by artist, and there is a chronological list by volume. All the measurements have been converted from inches to centimetres. Bouverie Hoyton's prints are reproduced in two different places, as his surname is hyphenated for all but one of his entries. In the original volumes, details of the publishers of individual prints were often included in the captions, information that does not appear here. An opportunity has been missed for a discussion of the editorial policy executed by the Index's founder, Malcolm Salaman, and his successor Campbell Dodgson, and their three American colleagues, Helen Fagg, Susan A. Hutchinson and Benjamin F. Morrow. Abstract printmaking was rigorously excluded, except for the isolated cases of Blair Hughes-Stanton and John Buckland Wright. The conserva- tive nature of Fine Prints of the Tear meant that the work of few of the artists included in Frances Carey and Antony Griffiths's 1990 British Museum exhibition, Avant-Garde British Printmaking, 1914-1960', were illustrated within its pages. Sickert, Griggs and the Goldsmiths' College school of etching were the most avant-garde artists to be found in the inter-war review More prints by Blampied, Osborne and the Italian Fabio Mauroner were reproduced than by any other artists. Coverage of European printmakers was very patchy and largely confined to French and Italian artists. A single Villon crept in. The American selection was just as conservative, although Martin Lewis's work was represented in strength. His etchings, however, were balanced by swathes of images of prints by Heintzelman, Walter Tittle, John Taylor Arms and Frank Benson. One suspects that the edi- tors of Fine Prints of the Tear relied heavily on print publishers' submissions. The relatively sparse coverage of the etchings and drypoints of the market leaders, Muirhead Bone and D. Y. Cameron, is surprising. The editors may well have thought that their work was so well-known and reproduced so much that it was unnecessary to pay them much atten- tion, and their publishers had no need to promote them. As well as the prints reproduced, Fine Prints of the Tear included a record of those published in the course of the year, which contained information on publishers and edition sizes. It is a pity that there is no hint in the new publication that such a section existed, as for quite a number of artists the details are not available easily or at all in other published sources. It is possible to build up a chronology of certain printmakers' work only from this source, martin hopkinson T. FRANTIŠEK SIMON. In 1937 Arthur Novak pub- lished a catalogue of the prints of Tavik František Simon, one of the most significant Czech printmakers of the first half of the twentieth century. Kronika grafikého díla T. F. Simona , written in Czech, was published in Prague by Sdruženi Českých Umelecku Hollar. This catalogue is now available in English on the Internet at http:/ /www. tfsimon.com. Novak, who had himself published two albums of Simon's colour etchings, Parisian motifs and Hradčany in 1916, had list- ed 626 prints from 1899 to 1937. This new catalogue opens with an etching of 1898, records 58 further works up to 1937 and adds eight prints made between 1938 and Simon's death in 1942. A small number of corrections have also been made. The majority of the prints are illustrated, although it is clear that impressions of a number of them have yet to be found. One would much like to find an example of Simon's colour etching of the 1905 Whistler memorial exhibition in London. An earlier print of his was an etched portrait of John Ruskin. In addition, on the same site there is a translation of Vaclav Rytir's T. F Simon exlibris: popisný seznam igio-ig^2, (Karel Somer, Prague 1932), which records 50 of Simon's ex- libris, both prints and drawings up to 1932. It is stated that further work is still to be done on this part of the site. Also published here is a bibliography on Simon's art and life up to 2004. The most significant recent publication is Scott A. Campbell, The Graphic Work of T. F. Simon (1877-^42) (Chicago, Frederick Baker Gallery Inc., 2002), which according to The Print Council Index Oeuvre - Catalogues of Prints by European and American Artists records some prints unknown to Novak. It is unclear whether these are all recorded here, or whether there are additional works to be found in Campbell's volume, which was a dealer's catalogue of 294 prints with a concordance to Novak. The Internet site includes a biography of Simon, sections illustrating some of his paintings and drawings, and a selection from his large collection of postcards, which is still being added by the site's compilers. It would be interesting to learn if he used any of these as aide-memoires in making any of his paintings and prints. MARTIN HOPKINSON MAX BECKMANN IN AMSTERDAM. The exhibition catalogue Max Beckmann: Exile in Amsterdam (Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, 6 April-19 August 2007, Munich, Neue Pinakothek, 13 September 2007-6 January 2008, Ostfildern, Hatje Cantz, 2007, 440 pp., 203 col. and 45 b. &amp; w. ills., €40), takes a first retrospective look at the works Beckmann creat- ed during his ten years of Dutch exile. Rather surprisingly, Beckmann's emigration from Germany resulted in one of the most productive periods in his career. In Amsterdam, he created a third of his total œuvre. The show brings together an impressive range of works: 50 paintings (among them five large triptychs) and as many works on paper, including watercolours, drawings and prints. Three excellent introductory essays examine this difficult stage in Beckmann's life. Carla Schulz-Hoffmann, Curator of the major Beckmann retrospective of 1984, works out the shift between the overwhelmingly positive public reception of Beckmann's work throughout the 1920s and the defama- tion of his art from 1933 onwards. Beckmann's departure from Berlin on 19 July 1937 coincided with the opening of the 'Degenerate Art' exhibition in Munich. This notorious propaganda show featured a cross-section of (mainly) PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="16">NOTES 443 German Modernism, and included ten of Beckmann's paintings and eleven of his prints. Beckmann, who was forced out of his teaching post at the Staedel-School in Frankfurt in 1933, realized that there was no way of accom- modating himself to the new regime. As a consequence, he escaped what he called the 'political gangsterism' of his native country. In Amsterdam, he described himself as walk- ing 'on the periphery of life'. For him, the city was initially a mere stopover on the way to Paris, which was then a spring- board for a new start in the United States. However, he stayed in the Netherlands for longer than he intended. Only in 1947 was he able to move to the USA, where he lived for three years until his death in 1950. The essay by Christian Lenz, director of the Beckmann Archive in Munich, concentrates on the artistic quality of Beckmann's Dutch exile. In Amsterdam, the artist created four of his nine triptychs ( Carnival , Acrobats , The Actors and Perseus). In a talk of 1938, given on the occasion of the show 'Twentieth Century German Art' at the Burlington Galleries in London, Beckmann stated that he was 'in Holland in the midst of a boundless world turmoil'. This experience of war and destruction is evident in many of his works of this period. His print cycle Apocalypse , a series of 27 lithographs that he coloured with watercolour himself, appeared in 1943. Its foreword stated: 'This book was print- ed in the fourth year of World War Two, as the visions of the apocalyptic seer became grim reality'. In 1946 Beckmann produced his last print series, Day and Dream , comprised of fifteen lithographs that refer back to his experiences both of war and everyday life in Amsterdam. The third contribution, by the Dutch art historian Beatrice Bormann, gives a vivid and detailed account of Beckmann's life in Amsterdam, complemented by a histori- cal map of the city. Bormann describes how, on arrival in Amsterdam, Beckmann was thrust back into anonymity and was only given one opportunity to display his works, in a small show in a private gallery in 1938. Bormann also out- lines Beckmann's financial plight during the war period. For example, in the 'Hunger Winter' of 1944/45 Beckmann tried to sell his belongings in order to buy food on the black market, not least because he was unable to find customers for his art. With the help of his son Peter, some of Beckmann's works were smuggled back into Germany, where they were bought by friends and collectors. Only in 1945, after the end of the war, did the Stedelijk Museum pur- chase one of the artist's works, the double portrait Max Beckmann and Quappi, of 1941. The Dutch art journalist J. M. Prange remarked in May 1947: 'It may seem incomprehen- sible to all of us that Amsterdam, that center of the arts, has accommodated Max Beckmann since 1937, one of the great- est German artists of our Western civilization, and he has passed through our artistic life largely unnoticed.' In retrospect, the limited public reception that Beckmann experienced in Amsterdam may seem surprising. For the Dutch capital, the exhibition is also a belated tribute to the German painter. More generally, as a joint undertaking between the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, the show and its cata- logue are an important contribution to studies in exile cul- ture. Published in the year of the seventieth anniversary of the defamation of Beckmann and his art by the National Socialists, the catalogue shows that Beckmann's artistic work of the last twenty years of his life is inseparable from his experience of persecution, war and exile. AYA SOIKA D'APRÈS LES MAITRES. To initiate and then achieve an inventory of prints belonging to the museums of a whole region is a huge and ambitious project. If we imagine that such an inventory would produce, as an immediate conse- quence, a series of some twelve exhibitions, several didactic activities and a three-day international colloquium, and that it would promote collaboration between museums and universities, this would appear even more unattainable. Nevertheless, it's true! The project is called Feuille à Feuille and it won the 2006 prize of the IFPDA (International Fine Print Dealers Association). The idea originated in 2002, when the Association des Conservateurs du Nord - Pas de Calais and the Gravelines Museum, supported by the DRAC (Directions régionales des affaires culturelles) Nord - Pas de Calais, the Region Nord - Pas de Calais and the General Councils of the Nord and Pas de Calais started to compile an inventory of their prints that were partly unknown or rarely exhibited. A team of researchers in art history from the Université de Lille 3, composed of eighteen students, also took part in compiling this inventory of rough- ly 25,000 prints. This developed into a database, available on the web, where 2,500 data sheets have already been regis- tered (see www.musenor.com). The digitization of the inventory is now progressing apace, and an international colloquium entided 'L'estampe, un art multiple à la portée de tous?' took place in January 2007 in Lille (see the Note by Carol Blackett-Ord, Print Quarterly , xxiv, June 2007, p. 175). After the inventory and database, the third aim of Feuille à Feuille was to exhibit the collections belonging to the north- ern museums. This has been achieved through twelve exhi- bitions held between November 2006 and June 2007. The catalogue D'après les maîtres: Léonard de Vinci, Raphaël, Watteau, Goya, Courbet ... La gravure d'interprétation d'Alphonse Leroy (i820-ig02) à Omer Bouchery (i882-ig62); (Montreuil, Editions Gourcuff Gradenigo, 2007, 112 pp., 94 col. ills., €24) accompanied the exhibition curated by Cordélia Hattori (Lille, Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse, 17 February-30 April 2007), which was one of the twelve. For a complete agenda, see: www.musenor.com/faf2/presentation.htm). The catalogue has two main purposes. First, to introduce the average reader to the contextual discourse on prints in northern France between the second half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. Second, this dis- course is illustrated by the inventory of two series of works, by the printmaker Alphonse Leroy (Lille, 1820-1902) and by Arthur Mayeur (Bouvigny-Boyeffles, 1871-Paris, 1934), who was a pupil of Leroy. Sophie Bobet-Mezzasalma's essay brilliantly illustrates the discourse on printmaking as an artistic form confronting the development of photography and the rôle of the PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="17">444t NOTES 'estampe d'interprétation' between 1850 and 1930. Through references to the Paris exhibitions (Salons and Expositions Universelles) and by providing an exceptional corpus of archival documents, Bobet-Mezzasalma reconstructs the problematics related to printmaking and the consciousness of the French artistic class of a potential decline. The danger came not only from photography, as one might assume, but also from the changing rôle of printmaking itself. Despite the weak support of the French government, lithography in par- ticular seemed to compete for the primacy of interpretation of works by Romantic artists (pp. 14-15). However, the low prices and rapid turnaround of photography constituted a serious threat to printmaking. At this point, French artists tried to find a solution to protect not only an artistic form, but also their own livelihoods. Thus some important artistic societies were created with the aim of producing a certain number of plates to share out among members. It was dur- ing the early nineteenth century that scholars such as Léon Rosenthal and Louis Hautecoeur repeatedly raised the question of definition between original and reproductive printmaking. This question is more complicated than it might seem, because it involves different nuances that still have to be explored. There are certainly shades of meaning between 'translation', 'reproduction' and 'interpretation' that deserve the attention of art historians and scholarly studies. The visual corpus of the exhibition is not haphazard. Hattori's selection is very apt, as are her contributions to the catalogue. Thus, the first series of works by Leroy (essay and catalogue by José Lothe) provides material for a study of fac- simile prints after Old Master drawings. This has to be placed in the context of the extensive work on facsimile prints that has developed in the past few years, with contri- butions such as Michael Matile's essay on facsimile during the eighteenth century ("'Das zweyte Ich der Zeichnung" Zur Reproduktion von Handzeichnungen im Zeitalter des Klassizismus', in Klassizismen und Kosmopolitismus. Programm oder Problem? Austausch in Kunst und Kunst-theorie im 18. Jahrhundert , edited by Pascal Griener and Cornelia Imesch, Schweizerisches Institut fuer Kunstgeschichte, 2004, 2 vols., il, pp. 193-208); the study on the printmaker Maria Katharina Prestei by Claudia-Alexandra Schwaighofer Ç Die Kunst der Nachahmung: Dürer, Carracci und Parmigianino in den Reproduktionsgraphiken der Mirnbergerin Maria Katharina Prestei (1J4J-1J94), Stuttgart, 2006); and the recent exhibition curated by Stephen Bann ('Multiple Masters: French Prints after Paintings 1700-1900', Oxford, Christ Church Picture Gallery, 26 January-15 April 2007). The second example supporting Hattori's visual choices is provided by Aurèlie Massin's study on Mayeur. The short essay and catalogue of Mayeur's prints focus on the devel- opment of the 'gravure d'interprétation' in northern France. Spontaneously, reproductive printmaking in France in the latter nineteenth century reminds us of the success of the Maison Goupil. Here, Massin, who achieved a second-year Master's dissertation in Lille, highlights quite remarkably the work of a printmaker who produced reproductive prints for print societies and was deeply involved in the cultural devel- opment of his region. The data sheets on both Leroy and Mayeur constantly refer to the original drawings or paint- ings - although these are not reproduced - in order to enable the reader to detect the changes and the interpretive work of these printmakers. The entries are similar to the data sheets appearing on the project's database (see www.musenor.com). which justifies their succinct character. If we reflect that this project has emerged from newly (re)discovered and (re)researched material and that it involved curators, institutions (for example, the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes) and students (like Massin), it is not only an achievement, but also a step in the study of reproductive printmaking and, hopefully, a source of inspi- ration tor other museums. CAMILLA MURGIA CHAGALL AND TÉRIADE. The Musée Départe- mental Matisse is now the repository of Tériade's complete published work, thanks to a donation from his widow in 2000. Chagall et Tériade: l'Empreinte d'un Peintre has been pub- lished (Chagall et Tériade: l'Empreinte d'un Peintre, Le Cateau- Cambrésis, Musée Départemental Matisse, 2006, Editions Gourcuff Gradenigo, 224 pp., 192 col. and 17 b. &amp; w. ills., €39) to accompany an exhibition (18 November 2006-26 February 2007) of all five illustrated books resulting from an intense collaboration between artist and publisher that last- ed over twenty years and brought to completion three works originally commissioned by Ambroise Vollard in the 1920s. The reasons why each book took so long to produce and why so much time elapsed between Chagall's first gouaches and the final print on the page, constitute the essential drama of his artistic development and the importance of Tériade as a publisher of livres d'artiste . Chagall thought in colour: the translation of his ideas into black-and-white etch- ings and later into lithography was a long and arduous process, mentally, visually and technically, requiring the greatest skill from his printers and an equal perfectionism and patience from his publisher. This generously illustrated book not only faithfully reproduces many of the early gouaches in colour, but also several plates showing up to six successive states of a single print - the only way to follow Chagall in his quest, as he expressed it, to try and 'capture the bluebird'. Like Vollard, Tériade left his native island for Paris and rejected a successful career in favour of the art and books that were his passion. Between 1923 and 1930 Vollard invit- ed Chagall to illustrate three books, the first of which was chosen by the artist: Gogol's Les Ames Mortes [Dead Souls), fol- lowed by La Fontaine's Fables and The Bible (Old Testament). None was completed before Vollard's death in 1939, by which time Tériade had reviewed an exhibition of prints for the books in progress and written two articles on Chagall's work for the Fables. On the artist's return to Paris from the USA after World War II, it was Tériade who took over the three unfinished projects and added two of his own: Daphnis and Chloê by Longus, and Cirque , in which the artist was to provide both text and images. Thus Chagall became the principal illustrator with whom Tériade worked. In Les Ames Mortes , memories of Russia are vividly evoked PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="18">NOTES 445 through scenes and characters that owe more to the pictori- al tradition of popular folk tales than to the Modernist aes- thetic espoused by revolutionaries. Céline Chicha traces the development of Chagall's illustrative approach from a con- densed narrative, full of detail, and rendered in pure etching to a more summary treatment of the subject that was given 'colour' by the use of drypoint, a progression illustrated by successive states of On nettoie les pantalons ( Cleaning his Trousers ), exhibited together last year for the first time, and all repro- duced in this book. That a Russian artist should be invited to illustrate the Fables of La Fontaine, regarded as a quintessentially French text, initially caused an outcry, but the tales originated in oral literature from Asia Minor that had first been noted down by Aesop, and Chagall played not on their national but on their universal qualities. One hundred gouaches in colour were exhibited in 1930 before the technical difficulties of turning them into prints temporarily defeated Chagall, who returned to the task only in 1950, when he experiment- ed with new techniques and tools and concentrated on sur- face rather than line. The addition of aquatint transforms The Miller, his Son and the Ass, for example, from near carica- ture into a scene from life. It was also in the 1950s that Chagall eventually complet- ed the book on which he had already been working for nine years when Vollard died, by which time he had produced over 100 plates. The Bible was a project in which Chagall could not fully succeed until he had visited the Holy Land, where it was the light, above all, that captivated him. His method of working, of superimposing marks or layers of tone achieved by a succession of different processes, is beautifully illustrated here by reproducing six states of The Exodus from Egypt and four of Elijah on Mount Carmel , an image in which the figure is transformed from a ghostly outline into an almost sculptural, weighty presence. Tériade finally pub- lished The Bible in two volumes 25 years after Chagall began work, an epic story told here with great clarity and precision by Francois Chapon. Set on Lesbos, the publisher's birthplace, Daphnis and Chloé was the first book commissioned, rather than completed, by Tériade. Illustrated with 42 lithographs in colour, it took Chagall's fascination with the depiction of light to a new level, and once more he felt compelled to visit the country in which the story was set. Tériade declared that Chagall was the only artist who could do justice to Greece, but none the less rejected his first illustrations, causing Chagall to set off again, this time for the Peloponnese. Translating his gouach- es into lithographs took three years, for there were up to 25 colours in each image, necessitating eighteen passages through the press. Here too, artist and publisher are well served by the catalogue, which reproduces in colour the original gouache side by side with the lithograph of Pan's Banquet. Famously faithful to the texts he illustrated, in 1962 Chagall was invited to produce both words and images for Cirque , a book that took five years to complete. As Emile Ovaere observes, the circus was, for Chagall, both an alle- gory of the human condition, an expression of modernity and, with his love of childhood fantasy, his own self-portrait. The forms that his imagination created have much in com- mon with the flying, leaping, hovering figures and animals that characterize the energy and atmosphere of a circus performance. It is nearly 35 years since Hommage à Tériade was shown in Paris. Chagall et Tériade is a worthy successor, providing pre- cise information on the complex histories of each individual book, with well-chosen illustrations showing the develop- ment of Chagall's own art and particularly his work in print. VALERIE HOLMAN SCULPTOR PRINTMAKERS. The recently reopened museum of contemporary art in Dunkerque, the Lieu d'Art et d'Action Contemporaine (LAAC), has played host to an exhibition of twentieth-century sculptor printmakers (15 November 2006-15 February 2007). This was the town's contribution to Feuille à Feuille , a season of shows held in eleven different venues to highlight the public print collec- tions of the Nord - Pas de Calais region. The exhibition under discussion was accompanied by the catalogue, Alberto Giacometti, Arman, Richard Serra . . . Des sculpteurs à l'épreuve de l'estampe au XXe siècle (Montreuil, Editions Gourcuff Gradenigo, 2006, 126 pp., 67 col. and 5 b. &amp; w. ills., €24), for which Frédéric Chappey provided the introductory essay. The individual catalogue entries were written by Marthe Muette, Myriam Morlion and Sophie Warlop. The prints in the exhibition came from the collections at Calais, Cambrai, Dunkerque, Gravelines, Le Cateau- Cambrésis, Tourcoing and Villeneuve ď Ascq, supplement- ed with loans from the Bibliothèque Nationale. In addition, sculpture was borrowed from the Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, Krefeld, the Stedelijk Museum voor Aktuel Kunst, Ghent, the Fondation Giacometti and FRAC, Nord Pas de Calais. The catalogue entries for each sculptor printmaker discuss the specific relationships between the artist's prints and sculpture. The 21 sculptors in the exhibition were of eleven different nationalities. The term sculpture was interpreted broadly, so that the Fluxus installation artist Wolf Vostell was represented by Piano Action, a lithograph that is in effect a plan montage of one of his happenings. Also included was an example of the screenprints of Christo, who uses the pro- ceeds from sales of the prints that he makes before the cre- ation of his emballages to help finance the completion of his projects. Karel Appel is another artist who executed his prints before his sculpture. His colour woodcut series Cirque , of 1978, was in turn based on gouaches executed from 1976 onwards. Appel employed the specialist printmaker Claude Manesse to make them. LAAC, Dunkerque, owns all seven- teen of the painted wooden sculptures that were the final product, a group of works that, as Chappey notes, echoes C alder's famous Cirque of 50 years before. Calder was anoth- er artist in this show who relied on professionals to produce his lithographs. By contrast with the prints of Appel and Christo, the late lithographs of César Dómela, a triptych of I973, reproduce his plexiglass, duralumin and wooden reliefs, interpreted through collages and gouaches. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200% 4</page><page sequence="19">446 NOTES One set of prints in this exhibition, Hommage à Rodin , was the result of a commission from the town of Calais in 1967, 50 years after that sculptor etcher's death. Robert Couturier and Henri-Georges Adam provided etchings, Henry Moore and Ossip Zadkine lithographs. Most of the works included here are of this period or later, the exceptions being the prints by Laurens and Arp, among them Dialogues , the for- mer's album of colour woodcuts (described here as litho- graphs), and the latter's contributions to the Carnet de Grasse , a collaborative venture with Magnelli, Sonia Delaunay and Sophie Taeuber-Arp. The stones for this were worked on in 1942, but the portfolio was not published until 1950. Laurens's illustrations to Lucian were also probably begun many years before their publication by Tériade in 195 1. The most recent prints in the exhibition were by Richard Serra and by the Filipino Peter Soriano, who like Raoul Ubac makes his prints directly from individual pieces of his sculp- ture. Chappey notes that in recent years there have been sever- al exhibitions and publications devoted to sculptor painters, painter sculptors, sculptors and photography, and sculptors and architecture, whereas this is the first to concentrate on the relationship between sculpture and printmaking. This is strange, given that arguably the physical nature of print- making is more comparable to sculpture than to painting. Chappey quotes from the artists Mauro Corda and Roger Vieillard, who share this view. Much of his essay concen- trates on the three-dimensionality of printmaking. He traces the beginning of modern sculptor printmaking to the late nineteenth-century examples of Gauguin and Maillol. The development of equivalents to bas-reliefs in relief print- making is discussed. Pierre Roche, Marcel Dumont and Alexandre Charpentier - artists largely forgotten except by specialists - are highlighted for their invention of glypto- types, gypsotypes and gauffrages in the dying years of the nineteenth century. Some of these innovations were taken up nearly 30 years later by Vieillard and Hayter, whose names are not mentioned here. Surprisingly too, one of the major printmakers of the inter- war years who was also a sculptor, Joseph Hecht, was not included in this show, per- haps because the Gravelines Museum had devoted a major exhibition and a catalogue raisonné to his prints in 1992. Chappey sees the work of Ernst, Tàpies, Arp and Henri- Georges Adam as heirs to this tradition in relief printmak- ing. He also refers to Hajdu's inkless prints of the late 1930s and to his êstampilles of the late 1950s. Also mentioned here are the litho-collages of Chillida and the Emprunts of Morellet. Arman's lithographs are described as sorts of fac- similes of his sculpture. Chappey notes that printmaking offered possibilities to some artists for experimentation with ideas that would be later transferred into sculpture. Matisse, Marini, Lipchitz, Archipenko and Moore are cited as exam- ples. MARTIN HOPKINSON JACQUES LE CHEVALLIER. Jacques Le Chevallier will be a name unfamiliar to most print historians, as his work as a painter and printmaker has been far eclipsed by his fame in two other fields. Le Chevallier was one of the most innovative designers of electric lamps of the second half of the 1920s. His collaboration with René Koechlin from 1926 led to a series of highly acclaimed designs of somewhat chunky lamps, which received wide publicity from con- temporary periodicals. Le Chevallier was very often the designer used by the architect Rob Mallet-Stevens. A later collaboration with Koechlin led to the production of children's toys during World War II. Le Chevallier was inspired to take up the problem of elec- tric lighting as the result of his experiences as a designer of stained glass. The son of a collector interested in architec- ture and of a teacher of drawing in Parisian schools, he was a pupil between 191 1 and 1915 of the unjustly neglected draughtsman and printmaker, Paul Renouard, at the Ecole Supérieure des Arts décoratifs. On demobilization from the forces he became a member of Les Artisans de l'Autel, a group of painters, sculptors and decorators dedicated to expressing their deep Catholic faith in the world of art. Le Chevallier designed a poster for their 19 19 exhibition. His religious beliefs dominated his art for the rest of his career. The physical devastation caused by World War I and the moral reaction to its consequences led to an explosion of commissions for religious art. It was therefore natural in 1920 for a gifted young man to join the glass workshop of Louis Barilliet, with whose firm he remained until 1946. Not surprisingly, Le Chevallier was initially strongly influenced by Maurice Denis. In 1923 Barilliet and Le Chevallier were joined in partnership by the Belgian painter, Théodore Hanssen. The firm received considerable acclaim as well as many commissions in the inter-war period. The church win- dows that it executed were almost exclusively figurative. Their style at times approached that of Georges Desvallières. Occasionally the glass contains hints of the work of Gleizes and Severini. In 1927 Le Chevallier travelled to Switzerland with Severini and Alexandre Cingria to see some of their decorative schemes in the churches there. The borders of Le Chevallier's church glass are some- times in the abstract mode of the Mouvement moderne. His secular glass was much more advanced, especially when he was working on commissions for the couturier Paul Poiret, and for buildings designed by Mallet-Stevens and René Herbst. For the latter, Le Chevallier executed the windows of Léonce Rosenberg's flat. He was a founder member in 1929 of the Union des Artistes Modernes. Mallet-Stevens 's commissions led to neo-plastic and purist works. Le Chevallier was clearly aware of Félix Del Marie, as well as of Mondrian and Van Doesburg. For his glass for the Aga Khan's Paris home he turned to the example of Charles Dufresne. Léger and Gromaire were also important for him. Le Chevallier's glass and lamp designs are well covered in a series of essays in Jacques Le Chevallier (i8g6-ig8y): La lumière moderne (Montreuil, Editions GourcufF Gradenigo, 248 pp., 353 col. and 53 b. &amp; w. ills., €39), a catalogue edited by Jean- François Archieri for the exhibition held initially at La Piscine - Musée d'Art et d'Industrie André Diligent in Roubaix. The show subsequently travelled to the Musée Départemental de l'Oise in Beauvais, and will also be dis- played in Paris (18 October 2007-8 February 2008, at 15 PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200% 4</page><page sequence="20">NOTES 447 square de Vergennes in the fifteenth arrondissement). Separate essays are included on his work as a painter and printmaker, areas of his work that are very little known. Le Chevallier studied painting with Eugène Morand alongside Maurice Brianchon, Roland Oudot, Raymond-Jean Legueult and François Desnoyer. Like very many artists of the 1920s he greatly admired Cézanne. Le Chevallier exhib- ited in the gallery run by Lucy Krohg, wife of the painter Per Krohg and former mistress of Pascin. This gallery showed figurative artists such as Gromaire, Goerg and Kokoschka. At times, Le Chevallier painted in veins akin to those of Amédee de la Patellière and Dunoyer de Segonzac. One would like to know if some of his gouaches of religious sub- jects were preparatory for pochoirs. In 1940 Adolphe Halard, the publisher of the papiers peints Nobilis, commissioned Le Chevallier to put together a 'collection of religious images and prints' for Editions Odilia, with texts chosen by the pro- lific religious writer, Renée Zeller. These colour woodcuts were intended to raise the level of Catholic illustration to counter the mediocrity of 'style saint-supplicien'. Le Chevallier assembled a team of artists including Hélène Bezombes, Henri Brochet, Jean Chièze and Hermine David. Some of the resulting prints were exhibited at the Salon de l'Imagerie in the Musée Galliera in 1941. Le Chevallier became a member of the committee of this Salon in 1942, and exhibited further examples there and at various shows of Christian and religious art in later years. His work was shown on Halard's stand at the Salon de la Société des Artistes Décorateurs in 1935, but it is not recorded here what he contributed. Le Chevallier had earlier illustrated a series of little texts by Zeller, which were published by Stanislas Furnet and Georges Hourdin in 1930, and for five other works by Zeller, L'année en ßte pour nos enfants , that were published between 1932 and 1935. The prints that illustrated Zeller's Pentecôte , published in Paris by Desclée de Brouwer et Cie in 1934, were certainly woodcuts. Le Chevallier illustrated Renée Moutard-Udry's Sainte Cécile for Librairie Henri Lefèbvre in 1944. He was also active as a designer of posters for the jour- nal L'Art Sacré and to advertise the Pilgrimage of the Rosary in 1939. Le Chevallier made many woodcuts in the 1920s. One of these was published in Images de Paris in June 1920 and he exhibited another at the Salon des Jeunes. He also produced illustrations for an Abécédaire in 1922 in a style that could be compared to Boutet de Monval. His work of this period was more often akin to that of Breton woodcut printmaking, as was his chosen subject-matter - peasant life and streetscapes. The colours that Le Chevallier used for some of his prints, ochres and greens, also resemble those preferred by certain Breton artists. In 1924 he spent several productive months in the Auvergne at the picturesque spa of Châtel- Guyon, the home of several of his wife's relations. Two woodcuts of peasants illustrated here make one wonder if he had seen the pre-war woodcuts of Othon Friesz. A visit to Italy in 1936 resulted in other woodcuts, one of which, a view of Assisi, was included in this exhibition. None of Le Chevallier's pre-World War II work prepares one for the complete transformation in his art in the post- war period. A new start was perhaps signalled by his atten- dance in 1945 at the atelier of the painter and theoretician, André Lhote. The key date may be 1946, when he aban- doned his partnership with Barilliet to set up his own stained glass workshop in Fontenay-aux-Roses. Two years later, with Joseph Pichard and Maurice Rocher, he reorganized the Ateliers d'art sacré founded by Denis and Desvallières, set- ting up the Centre d'Art Sacré, of which he was the Direc- tor and where he taught stained glass until i960. Although Le Chevallier continued to execute figurative glass, his best work was fully abstract. He appears to have stepped with no difficulty into the world of Singier, Bazaine, Lanskoy and De Stael. Colette Allendy, an early champion of Abstract art, gave Le Chevallier a one-man show in i960. Some of his designs deserve comparison with the finest of post-war French stained glass. Particularly notable are the series of windows of 1962-66 for the nave of Notre-Dame, where he had previously provided figurative designs in 1937. Le Chevallier also executed major schemes for the cathedrals of Beauvais, Laon and Soissons. Equally exciting designs can be found in parish churches, among them, fittingly, the Eglise de l'Immaculée Conception, Boulogne-Billancourt. Through Félix Del Marie, Le Chevallier became a member of Groupe Espace, and he began to exhibit with the abstract Salon des Nouveaux Réalités. He also turned to Abstraction in his paintings and woodcuts. These have some similarity with the prints of Raoul Ubac. He experimented with engraving as well, although none of the resulting prints is illustrated here. However, this venture may explain the occasional woodcut looking as if it might have been an attempt by Vieillard at the medium. At the end of his life, Le Chevallier combined Abstraction and figuration in a series of woodcuts of heads of figures taken from Greek mythology. For many years Le Chevallier appears not to have exhib- ited his prints, until 1973 when he began to show with the Salon de la Société des Peintres Graveurs Le Trait, to whose exhibitions he regularly sent work for the rest of his life, and of which he became a committee member. His woodcuts were exhibited at the first Biennale de la Gravure in Mulhouse. Le Chevallier also made lithographs, one of which was shown in the exhibition LArt Monumental at the Musée de Saint-Maur in 1981. A tribute exhibition, 'Hommage à Le Chevallier', was staged in the Cité Interna- tionale des Arts in Paris by Le Trait in 1987. The catalogue includes an inventory of the stained glass designed by Le Chevallier. Glass by him can be found in the Swiss Valais, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and Rome, as well as in many parts of France. Also recorded here are Le Chevallier's writings and interviews, mostly on the subject of glass and church decoration. In addition, there is a very full bibliogra- phy and exhibition history, martin hopkinson LUCIO FONTANA. In my review of Harry Ruhé and Camille Rigo's book on Lucio Fontana prints and multiples (Print Quarterly, xxiv, 2007, pp. 200-03) I mentioned the artist's first major portfolio of prints, Concetti Spaziali di Lucio PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="21">448 NOTES 238.

The portfo- lio's proper title is Un Racconto Spaziale: Uomo Donna di Milena Milani. It had an introduction by Beniamino Joppolo, and the catalogue of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence gives the date of publication as 1950. Two of the prints, labelled mistakenly as watercolours, were included in the Estorick Collection's exhibition, 'Lucio Fontana: At the Roots of Spatialiasm'. The Venetian critic, poet, novelist and translator of Kandinsky, Milena Milani (born 1922), was a signatory with Fontana and Joppolo of the First and Second Spatialist Manifestos and of the Proposal for a Regulation for the Spatial Movement. She was the wife of the famous dealer Carlo Cardazzo. Milani also contributed to the Farsettiarte Cortina d'Ampezzo exhibition catalogue, Lucio Fontana: un maestro e le sue tecniche , of 2005. Her La ragaz- za di fronte of 1953, published in Venice by Cardazzo 's Edizioni del Cavallino, was illustrated by six drawings by Capogrossi, and her La mattina sera of 1970, published by La Pergola Edizioni d'Arte in Pesaro and Milan, was accompa- nied by five etchings by Franco Gentilini. A museum that recently opened in Savona, the Fondazione Museo di arte contemporana Milena Milani in Memoria di Carlo Cardazzo, houses her art collection, while the Palazzo Jacopo di Verrazze hosted an exhibition of Milani's life and work in 2006. Also included in the show was the watercolour study on which Fontana based his contribution, Disegno Spaziale, to the very first album of prints published by Libreria A. Salto Editrice in Milan for the M.A.C. (Movimento Arte Concreta) on 15 December 1948. This portfolio of a single print by twelve different artists is described as '12 stampe a mano d'arte concreta'. The technique used is unspecified, but may be pochoir. It is conceivable too that the prints in the Edizioni d'Arte Moneta publication are pochoirs as usually described. The complete set of seven was sold as lots 32-38 in the Farsettiarte auction of 26 May 2002, and another set was exhibited in 2001-02 at the Galleria Comunale, Cesena, in the exhibition 'Lucio Fontana opere grafiche', no cata- logue for which appears to be held by a British institution. The Estorick Collection exhibition includes one further print, an untitled hand-touched lithograph of 1961. The show was accompanied by a book written by Renato Miracco, Lucio Fontana at the Roots of Spatialism (Rome, Gangemi Editore, 2006, 128 pp., 46 col. and 14 b. &amp; w. ills, €25). Its illustrations include some but not all the works in the exhibition, as well as others not shown. The two litho- graphs discussed at the beginning of this Note are described as drawings. The colours of their illustrations are not true to the originals. There is a short essay by Miracco and several of Fontana's most important writings are presented in English translations. These include the First and Second Spatialist Manifestos, the Technical Manifesto of Spatialism, the 1950 Proposal for a Regulation for the Spatial Movement and 'Why I'm a spatial', a Fontana essay of 1952, the origi- nal publication place of which is not recorded here. Miracco emphasizes Fontana's connection with the Italian Symbolist Adolf Wildt, reminding the reader of the older sculptor's fre- quent use of a gold background or gold areas in his very lin- ear drawings. One can indeed relate the jewel-like qualities in Fontana's prints of the late 1940s and early 1950s to Wildt's work, as well as placing the simplicity of their forms within Swiss Abstraction, in particular the art of Max Bill. MARTIN HOPKINSON JOSEPH BEUYS. There is no doubt that Joseph Beuys is one of the greatest artists since World War II and has been immensely important to several generations of younger artists. His drawings, installations, performances, writings and interviews continue to inspire a constant stream of pub- lications and exhibitions. What is less known, however, is that Beuys was also a prolific producer of multiples and prints. In interviews given to Jörg Schellmann and Bernd Klüser in 1970 and 1977 he pointed out the importance of multiples for the dissemination of his ideas, as well as an appropriate way of creating works of art. While this seems to contradict his usual approach of creating unique works, it was a natural consequence of his desire to communicate his ideas. It is therefore not surprising that he emphasized the importance of distribution in an interview whose introduc- tory question: 'Beuys, why do you create multiples?', served as the title for a recent exhibition and catalogue [Beuys, Pourquoi faites-vous des multiples ?, Gravelines, Musée du Dessin et de l'Estampe originale, 28 June-28 October 2007, Paris, Gourcuff Gradenigo, 2007, 96 pp., 84 col. ills., €24). Beside the few prints, the large number of multiples in the show are illustrated in the catalogue. Although one might wish to praise such an undertaking, it is tempered by a drop of bitterness. The catalogue consists basically of a shortish preface summarizing Beuys 's printed work, his multiples and the interview itself. It is nice to have this important interview published in a language other than German, but it is not for the first time. The subject itself con- tains much more, and offered a vast opportunity for explor- ing Beuys 's printmaking from the 1960s onwards and his distinctive approach to multiples. This potential was explored, for example, in an exhibition and catalogue of similar scope at the Kunstmuseum Bonn {Joseph Beuys: Zeichen aus dem Braunraum. Auflagenobjekte und grafische Señen , edited by Christoph Schreier and Anja Buck, Bonn, Kunstmuseum, 14 December 2005-12 February 2006, Bonn 2005). But the Bonn catalogue is missing in the short bibli- ography of the Gravelines show - which contains just eleven publications, including the Gravelines' own catalogue! - as are many other articles, books and catalogues on the topic. This confirms that the focus of the show was to present some prints and multiples, but not to go into detail or to examine the rôle of multiples and prints in Beuys 's under- standing of art or in his wider oeuvre , or, indeed, his particu- lar approaches and how he developed these with various publishers. This is a great pity. Despite the retrospective in 1994 at the Centre Georges Pompidou, it would have done no harm to make Beuys 's art in France better known and to discuss further this kind of artistic production. What was produced instead was a small volume with some pretty illus- trations, an interview out of its wider context and without PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="23">45° NOTES 239.

This is not appropriate to such an impor- tant figure and such impressive works, christian rümelin RALPH HOTERE. New Zealand printmakers are little known to art historians outside Australasia. So a thorough scholarly study of the work of one of its major contemporary artists is particularly welcome: empty of shadows and making a shadow lithographs by Ralph Hotere (Christchurch, New Zealand, Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waihetu, 2005, 144 pp., 137 col. and 1 b. &amp; w. ills., NZ$49.99) was Pu^" lished to coincide with an exhibition at the Christchurch Art Gallery. This volume includes a complete list of Hotere's lithographs between 1984 and 2004. In addition, there is an introduction written by Marian Maguire, the artist who printed 113 of the 122 lithographs recorded here, as well as essays by Peter Vangioni and Jillian Cassidy. Hotere received his art education at Auckland Teachers' College and King Edward Technical College in Dunedin, before working as a school arts adviser in Northland and Auckland between 1952 and 1961. The award of a New Zealand Art Society Fellowship in 1961 enabled him to trav- el to London, where he was introduced to etching by Cecil Collins at Central School of Art. After four years in Europe, Hotere returned to his native country and started to make screenprints. In 1967 he became a member of the newly formed Print Council of New Zealand. His first woodblock prints date from the mid-1970s, when he executed works based on the poetry of Bill Manhire, whose writings have been a frequent inspiration for him. A set of etchings made with the help of Jeffery Harris in Dunedin in 1980 were eventually editioned by Limeworks in 1992. The theme for these was provided by Manhire's poem, Midnight Window, Carey's Bay, to which Hotere devoted three lithographs the same year. Hotere's first lithographs were made in 1984 when artist in residence at the University of Canterbury's School of Fine Arts. Initially, at the invitation of Barry Cleavin, senior lec- turer in printmaking, he produced a number of etchings in collaboration with printmaking students, as well as with established artists, before embarking on a lithograph with Marian Maguire, one of the students. After making two lith- ographs with Frans Baetens and Magda Van Gils at Muka Studio, Grey Lynn, Auckland, in 1985 Hotere began his long collaboration with Maguire on a small press at her Christchurch studio. Two years later Maguire spent time studying at the Tamarind Institute of Lithography in Albuquerque, where Cleavin had been a visiting artist in 1983, and on her return in 1987 she and her then partner, Stephen Gleeson, set up Limeworks, where Hotere fre- quently worked until the dissolution of the partnership in 1994. Maguire then set up PaperGraphica in Christchurch, where Hotere has continued to work with her. The one sig- nificant group of lithographs that he made elsewhere were the six that he executed at Muka Studio in 1990, which included one published in the Muka Studio Portfolio: New Zealand Lithographs by Twenty Artists. Up to at least 1995 Hotere was also making etchings, many of which were print- ed by Maguire at Limeworks. Hotere had a sculptor's approach to his painting, using a grinder and an acetylene torch in the production of his stainless steel pictures. He also made use of a grinder in his etchings. In his lithographs he mainly draws with crayon. A progression can be discerned from a linear style to a more painterly one employing washes to create tonal areas. Hotere began drawing on aluminium plates when he start- ed to make colour lithographs, c. 1989-91, finding graining the stone too laborious. Two thirds of his lithographs have been made on metal plates. He worked on the plates at home, bringing them into the studio for proofing. This was a meticulous exercise. Sometimes up to fifteen proofs would be examined before an edition was pulled, and some series took eighteen months to complete. For the period between 1988 and 1 99 1 he incorporated chine-collê using Japanese papers in some of his prints. Hotere began to use multiple colours in 1988, and the following year started to experiment with layers of tusche washes. No visit to Spain is mentioned in the catalogue, but titles such as El Toro, Barcelona and Window in Spain as well as their style raise questions as to his interest in the prints of Tàpies. From the start, words have formed a significant part of the imagery of Hotere's lithographs. The dual nature of New Zealand is reflected in his use of both the Maori and English languages. His earliest lithograph incorporated a cross, a ref- erence to the death of his father as well as to a poem by Cilia McQueen. Other symbols include hearts, rainbows, doves, the number 14 represented by dots, a reference to the Stations of the Cross, and the chi-rho motif. Hotere's birth- place, Mitimiti, was a stronghold of Catholicism. As Cassidy explains, the cross also has a special significance in Maori society, as an X was used by some of the signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi. It could also be seen to refer to atmospheric effects seen in New Zealand at sunset. Latterly, the cross has become the Cross of Lorraine. One could see this as reflecting the heavy losses suffered by Anzac soldiers serving in World War I. This interpretation is strengthened by the title of the Anzac series of prints of 1990 made in con- nection with a proposed war memorial sculpture. In these lithographs, the multitude of simple crosses evocative of bat- tlefield cemeteries creates images akin to some works by Riopelle. Cassidy, however, follows Francis Pound in offering an additional interpretation of the repeated use of the motif. Both see Hotere's use of the cross as formally related to the work of Ad Reinhardt, on whom the artist has made a col- lection of books. Hotere, like Arnulf Rainer, has drawn over the reproductions in these to create works of his own. A resemblance can also be found in the New Zealander's earlier lithographs with the prints of Jasper Johns. Hotere is an activist, an advocate of human rights and a fierce opponent of apartheid. He executed a series of Black Union Jack paintings in 1981 as a protest against the presence of an all-white touring Springbok rugby team in New Zealand. Other works refer to French nuclear testing in the Pacific (see fig. 239) and to the campaign against Meridian Energy's Project Aqua involving the diversion of the Waitaki River to generate electricity. The preservation of the natur- al beauty of New Zealand and its wildlife has been central to PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="25">452 NOTES Hotere's art. His studio on the Oputae headland overlook- ing Port Chalmers, Dunedin, was sited on a spit of land removed by the Otago Harbour Board in order to increase the harbour's capacity. The scars made by the bulldozers are indicated by diagonal lines in his 1989 series, Oputae. Landscape is also the subject of Pathway to the Sea, a series of thirteen lithographs that he made with the sculptor Bill Gulbert, a native of Port Chalmers, based on the poetry of Ian Wedde, John Caselberg, and of his father Tangirau Hotere. Individual prints incorporate images of the neon tubes, shells and rocks that the two artists used in an instal- lation of the same year. Music has also been important for Hotere, first expressed in lithography in a drum piece for Jack Body ; described by Vangioni as a visualization of 'the timing or rhythm' of a piece by this New Zealand composer. Most impressive is the artist's tribute to Thelonius Monk, Round Midnight , of 2000, a suite relating to the months of the year. Contemporaneously Hotere was producing paintings of the same title on black corrugated iron and aluminium. Black, often immensely rich, is the colour that permeates his lithographs, even those that are multi-coloured, martin HOPKINSON IAN MCCULLOCH. The Glasgow painter, sculptor, ceramicist and printmaker, Ian McCulloch, has trod a lone- ly furrow through most of his career. Born in 1935, his single-minded vision has kept him aloof from the various Scottish groupings of the last 40 years. Surprisingly little has been written about McCulloch's work, although he has had one-man shows at the Gardner Arts Centre, University of Sussex, and the Camden Arts and the Aberystwyth Arts Centre, University of Wales, as well as in museums and gal- leries in all the major Scottish cities. The Royal Scottish Academy presented a selection of his recent work for the 2007 Edinburgh Festival, publishing a modest catalogue, Ian McCulloch: Recycled Lives iggy-200y (Edinburgh, 2007, 32 pp., 25 col. and 2 b. &amp; w. ills., £5), for which Colin Greenslade provided a brief introduction and McCulloch himself wrote an explanatory essay. Trained at Glasgow School of Art in the mid-1950s, McCulloch, unlike many of his contemporaries, gravitated not towards the Ecole de Paris but to German Dada, partic- ularly the work of Kurt Schwitters. Following Schwitters' example, McCulloch developed constructions out of the industrial and household detritus washed down by the stream that ran through his home in the then village of Cumbernauld. He was also clearly attracted by the art of CoBrA. McCulloch's figurai Expressionism preceded the much vaunted figurative paintings and prints of John Bellany and the New Glasgow Boys, Campbell, Currie, Howson and Wisniewski. It was in the 1980s, when such Expressionist works became so fashionable in Scodand, that McCulloch started to make large woodcuts. He had made relief prints in his student years, but had abandoned print- making for the best part of 30 years. McCulloch's artistic forbears, however, were very differ- ent from the artists admired by his younger colleagues, Beckmann, Stanley Spencer, Dix, Goya, Masereel - and in the case of Wisniewski, Matisse and Dufy. His stark, harsh figures sometimes recall Nolde's Vikings. Titles such as Adam und Eva and Elegy for Franz Marc openly proclaim his alle- giances. McCulloch found some of his printing blocks while beachcombing, an activity that inspired him to make assem- bled sculpture: heads made out of his findings washed up by the sea. The seashore on Bute had provided subject-matter for some semi-abstract works of c. 1962, when he was work- ing alongside another Scot interested in CoBrA, Alan Davie. The compositions of McCulloch's woodcuts and his paintings are frequently related, but often, as he himself writes, 'the block could accommodate only parts' of the drawings that he had 'previously made with paintings in mind'. On a visit to the Louvre in the 1990s he was strongly impressed by the fragments of figurative images on the remains of Coptic vestments. His two-dimensional figures arranged in opposition to each other sometimes recall comic-book illustration. The heads can occasionally be compared with the work of Horst Antes. McCulloch was a contemporary both at Glasgow's Eastbank Academy and the Glasgow School of Art of the visionary poet, novelist and artist, Alasdair Gray. As young men they travelled together in 1958 to Gibraltar and Andalucia. Forty years later they collaborated on the book, The Artist in his World. Gray contributed Eight Poems Written from 2 to j August on Eight Series of Prints by Ian McCulloch (Glendaruel, Argyll Publishing, 1998). McCulloch's eight woodcuts date between 1986 and 1997. A woodcut tribute to Velázquez's Las Meninas probably relates back to the visit to Spain. Goethe, the Bible and Celtic myths have provided some of his subjects. At least one of his prints has been a still life, Fish on an Ashet , of 1990. McCulloch won the Glasgow International Concert Hall mural competition in 1989-90. The resulting works, howev- er, did not meet the approval of the then Provost of Glasgow, Pat Lally, whose public rejection of them at the dinner mark- ing their gift by Strathclyde Regional Council to Glasgow Cultural Enterprises (the company through which Glasgow District Council administered the Hall) resulted in a major political furore. The year 1990 was, of course, when Glasgow was European City of Culture. McCulloch responded with a suite of four woodcuts, Help Glasgow. In 1999 he was invited to make ceramics. A visit to the Madoura pottery in Vallauris ensued. The latent influence of Picasso on his work has become more apparent in recent years. Works such as The Return of Agamemnon of 2003 are col- lages of prints and paintings. McCulloch has remarked that his later works are 'hybrids, incorporating printed fabrics and discarded items of clothing'. He has worked with Glasgow Print Studio, Edinburgh Printmakers and Peacock Printmakers in Aberdeen, and has also produced etchings and lithographs. His highly distinctive woodcuts deserve to be better known outside Scodand. martin hopkinson AUERBACH IN CAMBRIDGE. Mounting an exhibi- tion on a prolific draughtsman who sometimes worked as a printmaker is an interesting and challenging task, especially when the collection holds the entire œuvre of this artist. This PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page><page sequence="26">NOTES 453 is the case with the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Several donors contributed over the years to complete the collection of intaglio prints by Frank Auerbach and the Museum is now in the fortunate position of having a com- plete set. In the case of Auerbach's prints, however, 'com- plete' is a a relative term. The early prints in particular show wide variations. This arises out of the printing process, where Auerbach used a spoon to achieve an impression. These are not editions as such, but are records of artistic interest and often rather individual in character. If all these images together constitute an œuvre then the Fitzwilliam collection is indeed complete. As we know, printmaking was not Auerbach's preferred medium, but he used it from time to time. His subject-mat- ter is often related to his other artistic media, but tends to be more focussed and intimate than his drawings or paintings. Presenting this is an achievement of the Cambridge exhibi- tion. In addition, few print scholars would be better suited to write about Auerbach than Craig Hartley, who has not only written about this artist's prints in the past, but has also fol- lowed his development very closely over the past few years in his rôle as Curator at the Fitzwilliam. It was both logical and an advantage that he took on the tasks of contributing a short introduction to the exhibition catalogue and compiling a catalogue raisonné of Auerbach's intaglio prints (Craig Hartley, Frank Auerbach: Etchings &amp; Drypoints ig 54-2006 , Cambridge, UK, Fitzwilliam Museum, 6 March-10 June 2007; Kendal, Cumbria, Abbott Hall Gallery, 15 April-21 June 2008, Cambridge, UK, Fitzwilliam Museum in association with Marlborough Graphics London, 2007, 48 pp., 33 col. and 1 b. &amp; w. ills., £10). The new catalogue is basically the continuation of the work that Hartley began in 1992 while updating Podro 's list from 1985. He has now not only brought this up to date, but has published as references the often remarkable impres- sions that are in the Fitzwilliam. As most of these were gifts from Auerbach to friends, they represent a part of his print- making that did not always find the same formulation in other impressions. This individual approach to single impressions is one of the most striking aspects of Hartley's introduction. The chronological discussion and the outline of Auerbach's development and the questions he was inter- ested in helps us to understand the crucial points of this artist's approach to printmaking, and at the same time explain some of the rather peculiar technical points in the appearance of the prints. This publication will remain the basis for further discussion and exhibitions for many years to come. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN COLDWELL AND KAFKA. Franz Kafka and Dora Diamant lived together at 13 Grunewaldstrasse in Berlin- Stieglitz from November 1923 to January 1924. Opposite was a local park. One day walking in the park they met a lit- tle girl, Dora, crying uncontrollably because she had lost her doll - a third Dora. Kafka invents a story to explain why she had disappeared: 'Your doll has gone on a journey. I know, because she wrote me a letter.' The girl is suspicious and asks to see the letter. Kafka explains that he has left it at home but will bring it tomorrow. The next day Kafka shows little Dora a letter from the doll, Dora, who writes that she had to leave home for a change of air, but that she would write reg- ularly, telling her adventures, 'according to the rhythm of the life of dolls, which is not the same as that of little girls.' Each day Kafka's companion, Dora, reads out the letter from the doll Dora to the little girl Dora, as Kafka, the storyteller, works towards the ending: the doll is getting married and she will never see litde Dora again. Kafka's Doll is a collaborative bookwork between the writer, Anthony Rudolf, and the artist, Paul Coldwell (London, EMH Arts/Eagle Gallery, 2007, 48 pp., 9 col. ills., limited edition, £45). The format is a 210 x 280 mm hard- back without a dust jacket, with the text in Ocean Sans Bold 13/20 pt, white on grey. It was designed by Neil Crawford. The landscape shape of the book might reference the shapes of the envelopes containing the letters from the doll. The images have a background of abstract dots, resulting from Coldwell's use of computer manipulation, and the resultant pixels create pages that are reminiscent of the abstract insides of envelopes. But it also suggests a screen, something that prevents us from getting beyond image to an earlier reality, as well as a physical (film) screen, on which we project our thoughts and memories. Coldwell has made two previous books, Freud's Coat (1996) and With the Melting of the Snows (1998), employing tradition- al printmaking techniques but processed digitally, and has increasingly used drawing on top of the images. The output - whether book or prints - is also digital. Doll/ Branches has a 23-dot outline of a doll, joined up like a children's dot-to-dot puzzle, against a pinkish sky of bare trees, as if the doll is being translated into a constellation in the firmament. In the next image, Berlin , the doll (without the dots, but in the same position) is joined by an open envelope over a plan of Berlin: the letter writing by Dora the doll, if not by Kafka has begun. Pen /Ink has a photograph of a writer at work on his café table. Superimposed is a dotted line drawing of an angular pen (in black) and ink bottie (in an inky blue). The pen over the writer and the bottie over his woman compan- ion generate the inevitable male/female interpretation. A child lies asleep in Night Sky /Letters: on her are superim- posed the joined-up dotted lines of constellations, examples of the human mind trying to make sense of the unknown, reading stories and myths onto natural phenomena. These lines interact with three grey schematically outlined envelopes. Meanwhile the doll Dora attends school and Globe/ Book/ Compass conjures up the apparatus of the class- room - and the compass suggests how the dots of its own representation were created. The triangle of Doras is addressed in Dora-Dora-Dora , where three differently sized calligraphic versions of the name hover over a Berlin road junction, as if they are up in the advertising lights of the Platz. The junction also suggests resolution: Kafka's solution of marrying off the doll, and is taken up in House /Ring, where a grey-green photograph of either a real house or a doll's house supports an outline of a caricature diamond wedding ring. The envelope, carrier of this narrative - a psy- chological epistolary novel - reappears in the final two PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200% 4</page><page sequence="27">454 NOTES 240. Paul Coldwell, Envelope/ Crystal, 2007, inkjet print, 200 x 270 mm (Photo courtesy the artist). images, Envelope/ Crystal, where the crystal of the diamond wedding ring is carried over into a grey background of decanters and glasses, possible wedding presents (fig. 240), and Letters , where the oudine pile of letters sits on an indis- tinct photographic purple-tone image of dolls seemingly in wedding costumes. This is the end of the story, and its consequence is a pile of letters. Subsequently, enterprising journalists have placed advertisements in local newspapers hoping to discover the real little 'Dora', but so far there has been no response. Perhaps this is not altogether surprising. The grey and black endpapers are an indistinct photographic double- spread of railway tracks. The doll Dora's putative desire to travel became an enforced journey of deportation, degrada- tion and death for many Jewish families, and being a child, with or without a doll, did not delay this bureaucratic and sadistic fate. Of Kafka's three sisters, Ottla died at Auschwitz, and Valli and Elli were killed in the liquidation 01 the Lodz ghetto. STEPHEN BURY PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 4</page></plain_text>
