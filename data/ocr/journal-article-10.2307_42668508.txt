<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES 307 Septimius Severus and Sol, Carausius and Oceanus : two new Roman acquisitions at the British Museum J. H. C.WILLIAMS [plate 27] The British Museum recently acquired two important Roman coins, one of Septimius Severus and one of Carausius, with the generous financial help of the National Art Collections Fund and the British Museum Society in both cases and, in the latter, a donation from Professor Michael Crawford of University College London. Both are new and unique pieces and each serves to illustrate important aspects of Roman religious imagery as it related to the imperial personage. Aureus of Septimius Severus of ad 197 1 (PL 27, A) BMreg. no. : CM 1998.12-4.1 Weight: 7-38 g Die Axis: 6 o'clock Oby. : L SEPT SEV PERT- AVG IMP Villi Laureate, draped and cuirassed bust of Septimius Severus r. Rev. : PMTRP V- COS III PP Sol standing naked 1., chlamys draped over 1. shoulder, r. hand raised, whip held in 1. hand over 1. shoulder. This coin of Septimius Severus is a unique aureus of ad 197, as indicated by the imperatorial number Villi in the obverse legend. The obverse die is that used on the two other aurei of the same year in the British Museum collection (BMC Wars of Succession 221 = RIC 98, and 226 = RIC 102). Curtis Clay's die-study of the gold coins of these years reveals that this die (no. 36 according to his sequence) was also used to strike RIC 106.2 Four different types were thus struck with this obverse die which was the second of two aureus dies with this imperatorial number. The former of the two (Clay no. 35) was employed to strike aurei with a reverse design of Pax seated left (RIC 88), the reverse die of which (Clay no. 75) had previously been in operation before the proclamation of the ninth imperatorial salutation in ad 197. Clay's work shows that this ratio of reverse dies and types to obverse dies was not unusual for Septimius' coinage in these years. 1 Acquired at auction at Sotheby's, 15.X.98, no. 72. C. L.

The type is known for denarii made during the same tribunician year in Rome (RIC 101 : IMP Villi, TRP V; RIC 1 15 : IMP X, TR P V) and the next ( RIC 1 17 : imp x, tr p vi), and in the east (RIC 489 : IMP Villi, TR P V); and on his bronze of the same years ( RIC 742, 744, 749). One of the other aureus types of 197 also shows Sol, this time in a more complex scene in which, still naked, radiate and wearing a cloak, he is about to mount his chariot which is already climbing into the sky, indicated by a line of cloud; Aurora stands in front holding a torch, while Tellus lies beneath holding a cornucopia (RIC 102). It is noteworthy that on this type, unlike the new one, Sol clearly sports a bifurcated beard after the fashion of Septimius Severus himself (not noted in BMC or RIC). Thereafter, Sol is absent from Severus' coinage until ad 208 when he reappears on denarii in same pose as on the new aureus (RIC 217). Under Caracalla, he becomes a common type in a variety of attitudes (e.g. RIC 264-5, 293-4). The appearance of this type on an aureus as a companion to the denarii is of itself not remarkable. Its interest, however, lies in the fact that it represents the earliest appearance on imperial coins of a design which becomes one of the classic poses for Sol on the coinage of the third century, an important typological development which the appearance of this aureus serves to emphasise.3 Other coins from these years also show Severus, along with this two sons, with the attributes of Sol. An aureus of Geta struck a few years after the new type shows a radiate and cuirassed bust of Geta or Caracalla as Sol, right hand raised in the characteristic gesture of blessing, with the suggestive legend SEVERI INVICTI AVG PI I FIL, describing Septimius with the cult-title of Sol (RIC 21).4 Aurei of Caracalla and Geta of ad 200-2 show on the reverse a bust of Septimius radiate, jugate with a bust of Julia Domna on a lunar crescent (Caracalla: RIC 36, 52, 59; Geta: RIC 7). There is also a gem in Paris with their busts similarly equipped and paired opposite jugate busts of the two sons.5 Various aurei, denarii and bronzes of Caracalla from these years probably also have standing Sol reverse types, though the 3 Sol in similar attitudes does occasionally appear earlier on provincial coins : in this pose at Crete (. BMC Crete, p. 3, 13 : Vespasian); with sceptre not whip at Hierapolis-Castabala in Cilicia (BMC 8-9: Faustina Junior); holding globe rather than whip at Pessinus in Galatia (BMC 13: Marcus Aurelius); on horseback, r. hand raised, sceptre in 1. at Alexandria (BMC 413 : Trajan); cf. a coin of Julia Domna from Tripolis in Phoenicia (BMC 72), where a statue of Sol appears standing in a temple beside one of the Moon, both with right arms raised. This list is no doubt incomplete: see further H. P. L'Orange Studies in the Iconography of Cosmic Kingship in the Ancient World (Oslo, 1953), pp. 153-6. Cf.

Various explanations for Sol's arrival on the coins in ad 197 and subsequent years might be canvassed. Severus won important military victories in these years, over Clodius Albinus in February 197 and the Parthians later in the same year. The coincidence might suggest that Sol appears as a symbol of the emperor's victories, or that he was considered as the family's patron deity in his capacity as Invictus , his customary title which, as we have seen, is also applied to Severus and Caracalla on the coins of this period. That the emperor's wife, Julia Domna, belonged to the family of the hereditary priests of the cult of Sol Elagabalus at Emesa may also be thought to be relevant. The attribution of solar attributes to the family as a whole and not just to the emperor suggests a looser association between the god and the imperial family rather than a specific identification of Severus with Sol, or a cult of Severus as Sol, for which indeed no evidence exists.7 His advent on the coins is essentially nothing new to imperial iconography, emperors having been regularly depicted with the attributes of a wide and shifting collection of divinities, including Sol (or Apollo), since the inception of the Principáte. What is perhaps new in this case is the divinity in question: Sol Invictus, whose Syrian origins are betrayed by his second cult title Elagabalus, makes his first attested appearance at Rome only in ad 158 on a dedicatory inscription ( CIL 6.715). Frequent epigraphic mentions of his cult in Rome are not found before the reign of Septimius.8 Once established in Rome, however, he is incorporated into the visual rhetoric of imperial self- representation alongside other familiar divinities and in a manner no different from them. The first major appearance of Sol on the coins of the period 197-202, then, signals the arrival of a new, and major, character within the Roman repertoire of divine persons and symbols. But despite, or rather in contrast with, the later aberrations of the reign of Elagabalus, this was not a case of disruptive intrusion into traditional Roman patterns of religious iconography by an alien divinity. The cult of Sol Invictus may have been a new development, but the god is depicted in traditional anthropomorphic Greco- Roman style as the naked, youthful charioteer instantly recognisable to Roman observers from the iconography of Apollo. This image is quite 6 RIC Caracalla 30, 39, 40, 55a, 141, 407, 408, 410, 412, 474. See further A. B.

This took the form of a conical stone which appears on the coins of his reign accompanied by the legends CONSERVATOR AVG and SANCT DEO SOLI ELAGABAL ( RIC 61-2, 143-4, 195-7). Romans had of course worshipped aniconic images of stone for centuries already - the black stone of the Magna Mater had been imported from Asia as early as 204 bc - but they cannot have been familiar objects of religious devotion in Rome and may have been regarded as somewhat alien to Roman ideas and religious practice. Certainly, Romans seem to have reacted to the more unusual aspects of the cults associated with both stones in similar ways, introducing various controls on the participation of Roman citizens in the orgiastic rites of the Magna Mater, and expelling outright the cult of Sol Elagabalus after the downfall of the emperor of the same name.9 But Sol was first assimilated at Rome in his form as the radiate charioteer long before the arrival of Syrian Elagabalus, whose expulsion he conse- quently survived, apparently unaffected. Sol continues to appear on the coins of the emperors subsequent to Elagabalus and in the later third century enjoyed a second imperial hey-day, and a large new temple in Rome, under Aurelian, when coins addressed him as SOL DOMINVS IMPERII ROMANI (RIC Aurelian 319-22). The varied career of Sol on the coins of the third century, of which his appearance on the aurei and denarii of ad 197 marks the beginning, provides an object-lesson in the malleability of pagan concepts of divinity and in the successful, though not entirely unproblematic, integration of a foreign cult within Roman religious practice.

Though uncommon on coins, representations of the god in exactly this manner are known from contemporary mosaics in Britain. A splendid fourth-century ad example was found at Withington (Gloucs.) and is on display in the British Museum. Others are known from St Albans, Dorchester and Cirencester.11 A second-century altar from the River Tyne, dedicated, apparently uniquely, to Oceanus by members of the sixth legion, suggests that there was a cult in Britain, apparently unknown elsewhere in the empire.12 Some have, perhaps rightly, identified the famous head on the pediment of the temple of Sulis Minerva at Bath as Oceanus, and a similar figure also appears at the centre of the Mildenhall great dish, although he might well be Neptune.13 What does the figure of Oceanus represent? In common with other marine deities, he is associated with peaceful sea-travel and maritime prosperity which, of course, was within his power to promote or hinder: among his common attributes are an anchor and a rudder.14 These specific responsi- bilities of the sea-god lead to a more general association with abundance and material well-being which is implicit in the reverse legend: LAE [titia] CARAVSI AVG (trans: 'the plenteousness of Carausius the Augustus').15 On other coins of Carausius and Allectus, the legend Laetitia accompanies a ship-type, again associating prosperity with maritime themes, while two issues of 'quinarii' of Allectus have the reverse type of a ship on which reclines a bearded figure holding an anchor.16 He is usually identified as Neptune, but might also plausibly be identified as Oceanus: the icon- ographies, and presumably the identities, of these two popular marine deities understandably overlapped to a considerable degree. Oceanus also represents cosmic stability and peace as one of the primordial elements of the Roman Orbis Terrarum - as such he stands behind Augustus' throne on the Gemma Augustea as his supporter together with two female figures representing the earth and the inhabited world. The association of Oceanus with the figure of the emperor (emphasised by the composition of the new denarius with a portrait on either side, an unusual feature on Roman 11 For discussion and bibliography on the iconography of Oceanus, see H.

Anchor as attnbute: on the Tyne altar, and on a denarius of Hadnan ( RIC 75 = LIMC Oceanus no. 3); for rudders, see, e.g, RIC Septimius Severus 229 (denarius, 209 bc = LIMC Oceanus no. 4), and a mosaic from Petra where Oceanus holds a rudder and a ship in either hand (= LIMC Oceanus no. 60). 15 Laetitia commonly means joy or pleasure, but is also has the specifically agricultural connotation of fruitfulness or abundance which is certainly implicit here. 16 RIC Allectus 59, 131 : rev. legend VIRTVS AVG.</page><page sequence="6">312 NOTES coins) suggests that the emperor's power, both in extent and nature, resembles that of the god, a flattering comparison indeed. Oceanus was the majestic personification of the encircling sea that surrounded the inhabited world known to the Romans ; Virgil, whose works were not unknown to the authors of Carausius' coins, called him 'father of all things'.17 And, the reverse implies, Laetitia is the consequence of the close affinity between emperor and deity, a point stressed by the unusual, though not un- precedented, use of the emperor's personal name to qualify the virtue invoked in the legend. Oceanus also had a particular relevance to Britain, the one province of the Roman Empire which lay beyond Ocean (this presumably also explains the appearance of an altar in his honour on the Tyne). As David Braund has shown, this feature lent to the conquest of Britain an aura of the supernatural, as it involved overcoming not merely a piece of land and its people, but the divine Oceanus himself.18 The conquest of Britain was also closely associated with the exciting and resonant notion of world-conquest in the Roman imagination, whence Caesar's keenness to invade in 55 and 54 bc. Carausius had not conquered Britain, but he did claim to wield authority over it as Augustus and, insofar as his ships also dominated the English Channel and kept Diocletian and Maximian at bay, to hold sway over mighty Ocean as well. In this context, it is reasonable to argue that the iconography of this new coin shows how the religious and symbolic connotations of ruling Britannia, including power over Oceanus, were mobilised on Carausius' behalf to underpin his claim to the universal authority of a legitimate Roman emperor. Standing and seated representations of Oceanus or Neptune appear frequently on the coinage of Carausius, accompanied by his normal attributes of trident, anchor, dolphin and, significantly, a globe, symbolic of the effortless and beneficent world-power of the sea-god which, the type argues, that of the emperor resembles." In a clearly similar vein, two contemporary gold medallions of Maximian show the emperor naked and crowned by Virtus who stands behind him, reaching out with his left hand to Oceanus, who reclines at his feet, his head inclined upwards and his right hand held out towards the emperor. The implication is that even the great 17 Verg. Georg. 4.382. Cf. G. de la Bédoyère, 'Carausius and the marks RSR and I.N.C.P.D.A.', NC 1998, pp. 78-88, on Carausius and Virgil.

This might seem a rather trite notion, but underlying it is the highly evocative complex of Roman religious conceptions associated with the idea of the Golden Age, in which Oceanus played an important part in his capacity as guardian of sea-traffic and maritime trade.21 The peaceful transport of foodstuffs over the sea had come to be an important symbol of the power and prosperity of the Roman Empire. The vital food supply from the limitless bread-baskets of Egypt and Sicily to the city of Rome in particular was likened to the legendary bounteousness of the Golden Age, and in consequence took on a mythical status of its own, being associated with such figures as Oceanus whose divine munificence guaranteed the safe passage of corn and the continuing bliss of the people of Rome. Hence the frequent appearance of such symbols as corn-ears and bushels of corn on Roman imperial coins. These are not merely pictures of real things, they are symbols of imperial abundance and generosity, and of the Golden Age restored.22 A particularly vivid illustration of Oceanus' position within this nexus of ideas is to be found on the remarkable mosiac pavement from Merida (Spain) which depicts a whole range of personified virtues, natural features and elemental substances, all clearly labelled : in one corner Oceanus reclines in traditional guise next to Tranquilinas (Calm seas), Navigia (Sea-traffic), and two female figures labelled as Copiae ('Plenties').23 All of these personified notions stand behind the depiction of Oceanus on the denarius of Carausius, and they serve to represent him as the divinely guided guarantor of the material abundance which Oceanus provides. The bust of Oceanus alludes to all this within the rich repertoire of religious and cosmic symbolism that was so familiar to Roman viewers. 20 See F.
