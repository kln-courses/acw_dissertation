Scott Bowling Green State University Among biologists, the study of evolution has always been a fascinating mental exercise. Be- cause it chiefly involves the history of living organisms and therefore is rarely subjected to experimental tests, it permits a great deal more freedom and artistic license than do the more experimental branches of biology. It also stim- ulates debate and arguments, since the only test of any particular evolutionary hypothesis is its explanatory power compared with that of other hypotheses. Since any phenomenon can be ex- plained given a sufficiently elaborate set of hypotheses, the theory of evolution has enor- mous explanatory power, whether justifiable or not, whereas its predictive power is correspond- ingly small. An interesting historical phenomenon is the rediscovery of the theory of evolution in recent years, almost as if it were something new, together with its use in the study of behavior and, most recently, in interpretation of social behavior under the name of "sociobiology." Un- fortunately, the new evolutionists are frequently unaware of the genetic theory of evolution and have stuck more or less to classical Darwinian natural selection. There are two approaches to the evolutionary study of behavior. The first and, to my mind, the most fruitful is to discover how the evolution of behavior occurs, and in particular how such evolutionary processes differ from those that</page><page sequence="2">130 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [81, 1979] merely involve changes in anatomy. The second is to explain behavior on the basis of evolu- tionary history, and that is the approach taken by Barash. His is an attractive and highly readable book, described in the introduction by E. O. Wilson as a "primer" of sociobiology. Thus it may be taken as a positive interpretation and to some extent a critique of Wilson's major work. As with all popular works, one is concerned about the quality of the scholarship behind it. Since the book is about the evolution of be- havior, the first question must concern the qual- ity of the theory presented. Barash presents a concise account of modern evolutionary theory, including the factors of mutation, inbreeding, random drift, migration, and natural selection. He then defines the ways in which evolutionary theory can be applied to behavior--(1) histor- ical, (2) evaluative (in relation to adaptive significance); (3) correlational (correlating en- vironmental and behavioral variation); and (4) predictive--and adds suitable cautions about each. So far, so good. Barash then applies the theory to behavior and emerges with what he calls the central theorem of sociobiology: "When any behavior under study reflects some component of genotype, animals should behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness." That is, of course, a restatement of the principle of adaptation and carries with it all of the logical dangers that arise from it, particularly that of circular reasoning: because a particular behavior exists, it must therefore be adaptive. Evolutionists must always consider the null hypothesis: that behavior may have no adaptive significance, as well as the alternative hypoth- esis that the behavior is nonadaptive and there- fore is subject to negative selection. Barash's ap- plication of evolutionary theory thus suffers from an overemphasis on the role of selection and, with it, an overemphasis on prediction. A second criterion concerns the relevant scientific experience of the author. Unlike Wilson, who is primarily a student of insects, Barash's own research concerns birds and mam- mals, particularly the rodents known as mar- mots, close relatives of the woodchuck. From a sociobiological viewpoint these are an inter- esting group of mammals in that closely related species show great differences in social organ- ization, ranging from almost solitary behavior (in the meadow-living eastern woodchucks) to a high degree of social organization (in the mar- mots, who live under different conditions in the high Western mountains). This suggests that social organization may be related to ecology. As Barash quite correctly points out, the rela- tionship between ecology and social organiza- tion is a correlation and does not necessarily im- ply causal relationships. Barash is thus a sound and conservative researcher in his own field. A third criterion is the degree of sophistica- tion outside his own specialty. Here, the answer is not so positive. Anyone who deals with the nature of social behavior as it exists in non- human animals and man should be conversant not only with the fundamental fields of biology (genetics, physiology, anatomy, ecology, and development) but also with concepts and data from the social sciences, including psychology, sociology, political science, and anthropology. A quick glance at the extensive bibliography reveals only one or two references from any of the latter fields. As expressed here, Barash's knowledge of the human sciences is relatively superficial, but he is well aware of the criticisms that have arisen from these fields. Why, then, does the whole enterprise strike one as curiously hollow and unsatisfactory? The answer lies in the seemingly innocent and self- apparent "central theorem of sociobiology." When we examine its application to social behavior and organization we find two flaws: (1) that it employs the unstated concept of indi- viduality in analyzing social behavior (which is inherently self-contradictory) and (2) that it at- tempts to explain an extraordinarily complex set of phenomena in terms of one simple prin- ciple. These flaws lead the sociobiologist into two cul-de-sacs: (1) placing a great deal of em- phasis on certain narrow issues, such as the evolution of altruism, which turn out to be at- tempts to resolve the logical consequences of the above contradiction, and (2) attempting to ex- plain too much with too little, an enterprise that inevitably leads to the listing of complex social phenomena rather than their analysis, i.e., to the mere verification of their existence, which is something we knew in the first place. Further, the logic of adaptation can easily lead to the conclusion that "these things have to be because they are," which is not really very helpful and, indeed, in the case of destructive social phe- nomena, may actually lead to harmful inaction. Barash (and this is also true of Wilson) makes no mention of the concept of systems, a funda- mental general concept of all biology and one that includes that of evolution. Socially organ- ized groups are systems, with all the general properties of living systems as well as some pe- culiar attributes of their own. Social behavior in-</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 131 evitably reflects the nature of the system of which it is a part, as well as contributing to it. And although Barash has much to say about human behavior, albeit in a somewhat cautious man- ner, he has nothing to say about language, which is of course the unique characteristic of human beings and is the tool that he is using to try to analyze evolution and social behavior. Further, biological training can lead to what an anthropologist would call "culture blind- ness." Any scientist, particularly any scientist who wishes to speculate about human affairs, should be aware that he lives within a cultural milieu that largely determines his motivations, interests, and prejudices, not to mention his scientific training and the concepts associated with it. In reading Barash, one is irresistibly reminded of Ernest Thompson Seton, who searched the animal kingdom for instances of monogamy in order to prove that there was a "natural" basis for what he regarded as the superior practice of his own culture. Barash sees the other side of the coin and tries to find a "natural" basis for what our culture regards as sins. Thus he finds "prostitution" in humming- birds, "rape" in ducks, and "adultery" in blue- birds, all justified as contributing to fitness. Even if those were not examples of crude analogy and blatant anthropomorphism, they would illustrate little more than the enormous variation in social organization in the animal kingdom. Despite those criticisms, the endeavor that this book represents is an enduring one. The problem of human nature will not go away. People want to understand what it is to be human, and one answer is the historical one. Just as one cannot fully understand contem- porary human behavior without an awareness of written human history, one cannot comprehend what it is to be human without an awareness of biological history as provided by evolution. But a solely evolutionary theory of sociobiology is necessarily incomplete. In 1950 I expressed hope "for the further development of an inter- disciplinary science of sociobiology, one that lies between the fields of biology (particularly ecol- ogy and physiology) and psychology and sociol- ogy." That hope is still to be realized.</page></plain_text>
