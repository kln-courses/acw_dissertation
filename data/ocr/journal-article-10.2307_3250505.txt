<plain_text><page sequence="1">Professor Emeritus University of Heidelberg THE RISE OF PORTRAITURE IN CHINESE ART I. Earliest Phases ortraiture,I understood as a physiognomic likeness based on direct observation of a living person, is a late-comer in the history of Chinese art. It gradually emerged, after much more than a millennium of ancient China's artistic activity, as the outcome of a long series of conditioning formative stages. The earliest human or quasi-human figures, faces and "masks" are painted on neolithic pottery or modelled in clay as independent "idols" or as parts of vessels. In the Shang period the human figure had a very subordinate position, overshadowed by powerful animals, real or imaginary ones; anthropomorphic figures on ritual bronzes, if they occur at all, are far from representing real human beings. Even surprising new finds like the large bronze statue and some isolated heads2 (fig. I) from Kuang-han, Ssech'uan (13th to IIth centuries), evidently are not modelled after living human bodies and faces. The statue's real meaning and purpose are obscure or may be tentatively and vaguely supposed to be "iconic," or "symbolic" or "magic" within a cultic context ("shaman"? king? ancestor god?); equally enigmatic is the idea behind the figures crouching between tigers' jaws (yu vessels in the Sumitomo and Cernuschi collections) and that of the large, imposing human masks flanking vessels of the fang-ting type (fig. 2) or affixed to ceremonial axes. Some tiny figures and heads serve as feet or protomes of vessels or are inserted into the overall texture of the decor system. They look like symbols or emblematic signs rather than real figures and easily trans- form themselves into written characters. There is no interest in mimetic representation of Man for his own sake, in his actual appearance, his living conditions and his social environment; nor did a personified mythology require idols or provide opportunities for anthropomorphic illustration. The dominating numen, t'ien, appears exclusively in the form of a graphic symbol, a simple human figure with oversized head. Stone or clay sculptures in human form from Late Shang or wooden tomb- figurines from the Chan-kuo period still show a truly archaic style and do not try to capture organic structures or life-like movements; rigid stylization is the guiding principle. But during that same transitional era, from the sixth to the fourth or third century B.C., the first human figurines appear that really represent living people in their natural bodily proportions and in practical, everyday activities and movements: lamp and standard bearers, servants, acrobats and a Resume of the introductory chapter of a forthcoming study on East-Asian Portraiture - Types, Functions, Forms.

Simul- taneously, animal figures tend towards greater lifelikeness. During the gradual disintegration of the ancient bronze decor system, a separation took place between a mimetic, objective representation of men and animals on the one hand and an independent, purely decorative, highly stylized and mainly linear repertoire of ornamental motifs on the other. "Figure" and "pattern" drift apart and follow their own specific principles so that the human figure is released from the bondage of the ancient symbolic system and from its subordinate role, now being shown as an object of observation and depiction in its own right. Compared with the earlier periods, we see here a definite change for humanization. This gradual emancipation and general transition to figural art was an intellectual achievement of almost revolutionary consequences, being the first and fundamental prerequisite for all later developments of representational art and the basic step towards portraiture. Of course, several further intermediate steps had to be taken. 2. Figure - Person - Portrait Interest in the depiction of visible reality intensified during the Chan-kuo period when new methods of representation by linear drawing on a two-dimensional plane were developed. Here another revolutionary act was performed: the creation of the picture which meant a higher degree of mental and formal abstraction by transformation into a medium other than tangible figures in the round or in relief. Linear drawings of people, isolated or in interaction with others or with animals, now cover the walls of bronze vessels, mainly of the type hu: first loosely scattered over the available planes, then more closely interwoven in scenic actions and finally provided with a simple stage formed by buildings and landscape elements, such as hills and trees, as well as with an ambiente of actual social life. Human figures now play the chief part, for a long time to come occupying the focus of interest in Chinese pictorial art. (The most famous example of this stage of development is the "Jannings hu" in the Palace Museum in Peking; fig. A.) Important logical steps evolved: first the change for a free distribution of figures over the available surface to an arrangement in continuous zones or friezes running around a vessel, and then toframedpicture areas or "fields" enclosed in a well- defined rectangular format. Here an autonomous aesthetic sphere was marked off where sections from the totality of the actual world could be presented, figures of men and animals could act and things and persons could be reproduced more or less faithfully in their true appearance and in their Fig.^ ^ ?^-~ ~~4 A n of J Fig. A Rubbing ofjannings hu, detail.

These new methods of representational art, the result of an act of human self- objectification, were widely used and further elaborated during the Han Dynasty, setting up the fundamental standard which eventually allowed the development of a variety of new art forms. After the human figure - as such and still anonymous - had found interest for its own sake and as a subject worthy to be depicted, the next step followed since the Ch'in Dynasty when Chinese artists tried to achieve a higher degree of individualization, creating what may be called character figres by introducing, out out of a rich stock of observation, more or less realistic and expressive features, easily mistaken for portraits but without presenting true likenesses. As soon as such a figure is meant to represent not only a typical, arbitrary, anonymous and imaginary specimen but some particular individual, known by name and living at the present or an earlier time, the figure identifies a specific person without, however, actually showing him by depicting his real features. Portraiture arises, on this basis, as the result of an act of distance-keeping, objectification and critical comparison between reality and reproduction. And only when a person's picture is directly and purposely made to conform with his features, a real portrait is done, constituting a special category rising out of the undifferentiated stratum of general, anonymous "figures" and typified "persons." This final task was accomplished mainly in the Chin and perfected in the T'ang Dynasty, constituting the last phase of a long, consistent development from initial humanization first to individualization by means of certain physiognomic characteristics, then to personalization as a preparatory step toward true portraiture where eventually persons receive their own faces immediately to be recognized and identified. But whenever it was impossible to portray a person's actual features because he lived in an earlier time, an imaginary portrait had to be created, with well-chosen characteristics suggesting "what he could have looked like" - often according to accepted ideal standards. (The term "ideal portrait" is too ambiguous to be of much value.) This portrait type is not identical with images of general, anonymous "figures" because an imaginary, fictitious portrait must show a specific person who really existed in history and was well known by name, date and biographical facts. Always in great demand, it was destined for a long and creative future side by side with the true portrait. In a portrait a person appears to others in true shape as an Ego among his fellow-men and establishes personal contact with them. The likeness can serve various religious and secular purposes and thus fulfil its social function. Evidently the increasing interest in humanity and individuality is closely connected with Confucianism which placed Man in the center of a social and ethical system. Reflection on the inner nature of man as a social being as well as an individual logically implied intensified observation and increasingly faithful representation of his outward appearance. This evolution was of course not an orderly progress from a starting point towards a preconceived goal, there were many regional peculiarities, older and more advanced modes of representation co- existed. But at the bottom of all these varied phenomena a general trend with an inherent logic is evident. This sequence of the essential phases - which has largely to be reconstructed or conjectured on the basis of sporadic pieces of evidence - we propose to sketch briefly, incidentally trying to distinguish between what may or should rightly be called a portrait and what not. Why and how it happened that the Chinese on their own account, as the result of a consistent ("logical") process and independent of any external prototypes or models, created portraiture for the whole of East Asia is a question that seems never to have been discussed. 9</page><page sequence="4">3. Character Figures and Personal Images (Ch'in and Han) Before the final steps to portraiture could be taken, Chinese artists had to create and develop the character-figure which exhibits pronounced physiognomic traits derived from a rich store of observation so that the figures look deceptively "realistic," even portrait-like. But for quite a long while (several centuries) the figures remain types conformin types conforming to exemplary models. Their remarkable display of seemingly personal features was made possible by perfecting the available technical and artistic means. A sudden climax was reached in the famous army of several thousand more than life- sized clay statues of soldiers which Ch'in Shih-huang-ti (r. 22I-2I0 B.C.) dictatorially ordered to be made for the protection of his tomb (fig. 3); they could be produced only with unlimited resources of material, man-power and logistic organization. Accordingly the technical procedure was mechanized by the use of prefabricated "modules" required for building up such a large number of similar bodies from a stock of standardized parts, variously combined and modified. Although by subsequent careful modelling of the faces a certain, sometimes deceptive degree of physiognomic individual- ization was achieved (probably enlivened by the original colouring, now almost vanished), we can be sure that none of these heads are portraits in the true sense of the term. To call them "imaginary portraits" would not be appropriate either sin ther since they do not rereesent people of known identity. A key document for the development of figure-representation during Han times are the painted tile-slabs in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 7), to be dated, on the basis of the recent find of similar paintings in tomb No. 6I of Shao-kou-ts'un near Loyang,3 to ca. I00-50 B.C. or a little later. The figures, "self-sufficient, conscious individuals, not merely symbols or stereotypes" (Cahill), are shown in a variety of postures and with lively gestures, evidently engaged in conversation or dispute - drawn in the then "modern" manner with the pliable, versatile lines made possible by the flexible brush. It was successfully used for expressive, individualized features, and although there can be no question of true portraits, these faces represent a very important preparatory phase for portraiture, for these figures could not possibly have been painted without an intense physiognomical and psycho- logical interest and keen observation. But they are too much bound to a narrative context to pass for portraits which would certainly have required a more formal presentation. Less sophisticated and, due to another medium, less "calligraphic" are the lacquer paintings decorating the famous basket from Lolang (ist to 2nd century A.D.; fig. 8), but they, too, show a remarkable ability to create lively figures and groups, differentiated physiognomically and joined to each other in scenic actions and by expressive attitudes. Since they illustrate the Paragons of Filial Piety they are no portraits either, but being individuals known by names, biographies and legends, they are "persons" rather than mere "figures." A remarkable detail in the story of Ting Lan is the wooden statue of his deceased mother which he had made so that he could venerate her just as he did in her lifetime. This is the first pictorial document of a portrait statue in Chinese art, but it is sharply set apart from all the living, active persons in those pictures by an immobile, stereometric shape that defines it as an artefact: an idol, not an image. Figures characterized by expressive features and gestures, sometimes meeting in conversation, had a long tradition before we see them in actual paintings like these: in a more archaic form we find 3 Chung-kuzo Mei-shuz Ch'iian-chi: Hui-hua (Peking: Wen-wu ch'u-pan-she, 1989), vol. 12, pi. 3; Jan Fontein and Tung Wu, Unearthing China's Past (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, I973), no. 40, pp. 96-00oo; James Cahill, Chinese Painting (Geneva: Skira, I960), p. It. IO</page><page sequence="5">them as early as the third century B.C. on the well-known tomb tiles from western Honan (fig. B) where the engraved lines of the drawings are evidently done after brushed designs, transposing them skillfully into the different medium. Much later, near the end of Later Han, comparable figures - now more sophisticated - appear in the I-nan Tomb testifying to an unbroken tradition of "character figures in action" all through those centuries, with expressive faces and lively interaction in dialogues and other situations. Even a liking for downright caricature seems to have existed: not long ago an amateurish but drastically satiric drawing was discovered in a Later Han tomb, showing a man from a "barbaric tribe" with staring eyes and an enormous nose (fig. 4). It aims at a type, of course, not an individual. All these examples are evidence of an advanced interest in observing and representing human features and behavior; simultaneously the art of narrative illustration was developed for the walls of palace halls, tomb chambers and offering shrines. In tombs and shrines (such as at Liao-yang, Hsiao-t'ang-shan or in the Wu Liang tz'u, all of the second century A.D.), they are often thematically connected with the owner of the tomb or shrine, thus initiating a further phase on the long way towards portraiture by placing them in a person-related context, especially when they show biographical or genre scenes from the owner's social sphere and official career, admonitory examples from history or from the Confucian classics. It is in such tombs that some important early specimens of personalized images are found: best known and preserved are the murals in North Korean tombs of the Koguryo period (fig. 6). Although some centuries later (4th to 6th centuries) they obviously follow the Han tradition and allow us to imagine the lost "portraits" of earlier times. The faces of the tomb-owners are still typified in an idealizing courtly style but represent specific persons known by their names and documented in history. Another method of personalization - intermediate between unspecified figure and portrait - was to provide anonymous figures with inscriptions giving their names, titles, ranks or offices; an example Fig. B Engraved Figure ofa Man are the officials attending their master in the Wang-tu Tomb in Hopei (rubbing), Tomb Tile from Western Honan; ca. 3rd cent. B.C. (Ist-2nd century). Here the brushwork of the written characters is a good deal more advanced and more competent than that of the figures: they are done in the li-shu script which during all these centuries of the Han Dynasty was the most widely used form of writing. As it was the first Chinese script to make successful use of the flexible brush it certainly contributed much to the perfection of brush-drawing in the art of painting - and this achievement, as exemplified by the Boston slabs mentioned above, was instrumental in giving liveliness to "character figures" and expressiveness to their features. Of course, these forms of representing human figures did not follow each other in a straight chronological sequence; during the long centuries of Han rule there certainly was much experi- mentation, occasionally finding pioneer solutions of various problems. Such a key work was produced quite early, in the first half of the second century B.C.: it is the first painting of an individual person that we know of so far, the "portrait" of the Marquise of Tai, done in the central field of the silk II</page><page sequence="6">"banner" found covering her coffin (fig. 5). Her identity is documented beyond all doubt not only by her tomb and its grave-goods but even by her relatively well-preserved corpse (Tomb No. I at Ma- wang-tui). A closely similar companion piece was found in the tomb of her son who died in 168 B.C. (Tomb No. 3). Certainly these two figures, shown standing or walking in profile with some atten- dants, are not portraits in the strict sense of the term but in spite of their generalized features they allow us - for the first time in Chinese art - to meet historical "persons" (as opposed to imaginary, typified "figures"). The fundamental purpose of all portraiture, to allow personal identification, was certainly aimed at but, as far as we know today, it took quite a long time to reach the final stage of mimetic portrayal. Han and later sources tell us a lot about portraits of historical as well as well as contemporary persons but unfortunately we have only a faint idea of what they may have looked like - probably not much different from what archaeological evidence has brought to light so far. We have to keep in mind that what is called a portrait in the texts may not have given a person's true likeness but only a picture intended as such, giving the identity by mere iconographic signs (emblems of rank, etc.) or by the inscription of the name, of biographical information and perhaps of a eulogy praising the man's virtue and merits. The Han Dynasty saw the rise of biographical writing - its first and classical author being Ssu-ma Ch'ien (I45?-90? B.C.) who at the same time wrote the first and exemplary auto- biography - conforming ther thoward personalization which was a precon- dition for portraiture. A biography may be called a literary portrait, but just as the early "portraits" still followed certain general types, Chinese biographies tended to shape their models after acknowledged ideals and patterns. In Han times both portrait and biography had not only a documentary and memorial but predominantly an admonitory function, closely interwoven with political ideology, social ethics and ancestor worship. The types of persons depicted in Han portraits - paintings as well as statues are documented - were limited to the privileged groups belonging to the "establishment" who alone were entitled to commission portraits or to be honoured by them: rulers, princes, meritorious civil officials and military officers, persons of special merit and virtue, heroes of history and antiquity, "sages" embodying the Confucian system of social and moral values - all of them worthy to be honourably remembered by future generations and to serve as exemplary models (or else, if lacking in these qualities, as deterrent warnings). Many portraits mentioned in Han sources were painted, by order of the rulers, on the walls of palace halls, or they were used in tomb chambers and offering shrines of noble families for the cult of parents and ancestors. We can be fairly sure that these "portraits" were normally more or less typified images and imaginary portraits rather than true likenesses, repres- enting social status rather than individual features. Ancestor worship certainly gave a major stimulus to Han portraiture but we have no clear and concrete idea of what role was played in the cult by portrait statues or paintings and what they looked like. The ancestor image was widely rivalled, in accordance with Confucian doctrine, by the ancestor tablet inscribed with the mere name of the deceased, but the story of Ting Lan's "wooden mother" and its illustration on the Lolang basket documents the existence of such images, as do several pieces of Han textual evidence. Another source for the genesis of portraiture may have been the (mainly Taoist) belief in longevity and the desire to preserve the "immortal body" for an after-life; the Ma-wang-tui Tomb No. I (that of Lady Tai) has furnished evidence both by her purposely preserved body and her "portrait" on the 12</page><page sequence="7">painted "banner." The identity of the living person with the duplicating image could even have a magic character, as is exemplified by some anecdotes from various periods; "perhaps every sudden advance... in the ability to mimic Nature bought a fresh surge of superstitious excitement and new stories."4 The wish to face the deceased in corpore, as a quasi-living person "embodied" in an image, may have been one of the most powerful motives for the creation of portraits. In a sense this search for "presence in reality" has a dialectic relationship to the above-mentioned principles of "abstraction" and "objectification" inherent in all pictorial representation. Although in most cases we must imagine Han portraits to have been more or less typified images, there does exist some evidence for a striving after a certain degree of verisimilitude that allowed, by conforming a likeness to a person's individual features, to directly recognize people by their portraits. Literary sources tell of a number of portraits drawn from life; some were even used as "warrants" for finding wanted persons. One of these refers to the Shang king Wu-ting in whose time a realistic likeness of course would have been a sheer anachronism - but since the story is reported in Shih-chi by Ssu-ma Ch'ien of the Former Han Dynasty, such a portrait must have been thought possible in his own time. The same author expressed his amazement when he saw a portrait of Chang Liang (died I89 B.C.), general and counselor of the first Han emperor Kao-tsu (Liu Pang, died I95 B.C.): "I had always imagined... that Chang Liang must have been a man of majestic stature and imposing appearance. And yet when I saw a picture of him, his face looked like that of a woman or a pretty young girl."5 This portrait may have been an imaginary, typified or idealized one - we have no means of deciding the matter, but one thing seems to follow: that in Ssu-ma Ch'ien's time a minimum of verisimilitude in portraits was expected. How far it was achieved is another question. As we have seen, in general figure painting, without individual identification of certain persons, the representational competence reached in Han times could be remarkable, especially in genre or narrative pictures, but it would be risky to infer a similar degree of "realism" in contemporary portraiture which certainly was governed by strict social and ritual conditions and therefore by a more formal mode of representation. True portraits, with intentional conformity of the likeness with a person's features, did not appear until much later, eventually in the T'ang period when not only texts relate explicit statements as to the faithfulness of certain portraits but when specimens of convincingly life-like portraits are actually available. The early interest in "character figures" or certain preliminary forms of portraiture may have been greatly stimulated by the science and art of physiognomy which had been developed and perfected since at least the third century B.C. and was very much in vogue during the Han Dynasty. Even a skeptic like Wang Ch'ung (27-97 A.D.) acknowledged it as a relatively "scientific" method of correlating the inner constitution of persons with their outward appearance and to interpret physiognomic signs as manifestations of character.6 At the same time physiognomy served as an art of fortune-telling and of bringing a person's features and constitution in relation to cosmic forces as well as to moral standards. In some Han biographies of important people their physical build and their features are described, thus furnishing literary portraits. (In Han times even a physiognomy of 4 Alexander C.

Later Chinese art developed great virtuosity in creating whole series of variant physiognomic types, as in the innumerable ceramic tomb figurines. Physiognomy must have been an excellent training in exact observation, contributing a good deal to the production first of character figures and then, more specifically, to individual portraits. 4. Chin Portraits The centuries following the fall of the Han Dynasty and the disintegration of the empire, particularly the time of the Eastern Chin Dynasty (317-419), may be called the formative period in the history of portraiture. Although we still have to do without original specimens of true individual likenesses, historical and literary sources now give so much concrete evidence of portraits and their artists that we feel on safer ground; Ku K'ai-chih (ca. 344-ca. 406), the "ancestor" of Chinese portraiture, was active in this period. As is well known, the era was characterized by the rise of individualism and subjectivism resulting from the dissolution of the strict ideological system; pursuit of personal freedom and autonomy, self-consciousness, intellectual reasoning, criticism and sophistication, artistic creativity in poetry, music and art were the dominating concerns of the educated class. Individual independ- ence even led to the extremes of anarchic libertinism and to a bohemian, deliberately shocking behavior (along with inspiring intoxication). An intense and refined feeling for the beauties of Nature found expression in the works of great poets like T'ao Yuiian-ming (365-427); Taoism and Buddhism - the latter now being rooted in southern China - opened new, universal dimensions of thinking and religious experience. The non-conformist intelligentsia, escaping whenever possible from the constraints of official bureaucracy, political strife and the bourgeois way of life, had a special liking for brilliant, sophisticated discussions ("pure conversations," ch'ing-t'an), held among groups of congenial friends inspired by wine and music. One of the favourite subjects of these talks as documented in the Shih-shuo Hsin-yi by Liu I-ch'ing (403-444), were psychological problems and critical comments on other people's character, behaviour and modes of expression; at the same time, autobiographies made rapid progress between the third and fifth centuries. It is evident that this intellectual climate greatly helped to promote portraiture; to the basic accomplishments achieved in Han times was added, in conjunction with the art of physiognomy, an intensified interest in and ability for the representation and interpretation of individual characters so that portraitists could reach a new level of competence. "In the age of disunion the aesthetic value of the jen-wu theme [representation of human figures] was enhanced by the emergence, for the first time, of great individual artists like Ku K'ai-chih and Lu T'an-wei, who gave all their genius to its service. Ku and Lu were celebrated first of all as portraitists, presumably because their age was especially sensitive to the rich flavour and variety of human personality. The very features that made the period one of political weakness and humiliation were in this other sense beneficial."7 Simultaneously a parallel development took place in the art of writing ("calligraphy"): it no longer followed prescribed rules, norms and patterns as did the more or less masterly performances of pro- fessional scribes but became a highly individual, creative art expressing in a free, unimpeded manner 7 Alexander C. Soper, "Chinese Art and Liberal Education," H. G. Creel ed., Chinese Civilization in Liberal Education (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I958):74.

I4</page><page sequence="9">the writer's personality; the result was something like a graphological self-portrait, by immediate communication "transmitting the spirit through form." This formula was coined in those days, once and for all, as a definition of portraiture; both art forms, writing and portraiture, had the common purpose and capacity to evoke a person's presence by direct visualization. The greatest master in this new art medium of writing, Wang Hsi-chih (303-36I), was a near contemporary of the famous por- traitist Ku K'ai-chih, and perhaps it is not by accident that Wang is reported to have been the first to paint a self-portrait with the aid of a mirror. The paths of both art forms, however, branched off in different directions: calligraphy continued to be a purely graphic, abstract art while portraiture, as did painting in general, began to move gradually towards objective, mimetic depiction of reality. The area where all these cultural developments took place was southeastern China, and it was there, in the present city of Nanking and its vicinity (Tan-yang District) that the most important documents ofproto-portraiture from this period were discovered: the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (fig. 9), executed on thread-relief drawings on tiles lining the walls of three tombs, one of them to be dated around 400, the other two, belonging to members of the Southern Ch'i Dynasty but continuing the same tradition, around 500oo A.D. The figures, singly seated under trees, are divided into two rows of four - eight in all since the seven philosophers, poets and musicians, paragons of the new way of life and thought who lived between 205 and 305, were joined, perhaps for the sake of symmetry, by Jung Ch'i-ch'i, a contemporary of Confucius who praised him as "one who has attained freedom." This group became a subject popular in all later Chinese painting, forming the prototype of many "literary gathering" pictures, especially in late Ming when a similar intellectual climate prevailed.8 The three sets from the Nanking tombs, technically simplified versions of the subject, show that it must have been in vogue in contemporary painting and, according to literary evidence, even in the preceding fourth century, not very long after the Sages' lifetimes. Why are these figures key works in the history of portraiture? First, as in so many cases, by their rarity value: we have, so far at least, no comparable pieces of evidence from this period. Second, they represent (with the exception ofJung Ch'i-ch'i) historically documented, well-known persons not long ago deceased, with their names inscribed beside them: some of them are famous by their works (in the first place Hsi K'ang, the ch'in [zither] master and theorist, 223-262) and by anecdotes; and they all impersonate an ideal type that was destined to play an important role in Chinese cultural life, the Cultivated Gentleman, free from official obligations, preferring solitude or the intimate company of friends to social bonds, expressing thoughts and feelings in poetry, music and artistic pursuits. (Some of them, as so many others in Chinese history, could not avoid becoming involved in political conflicts and met a tragic fate.) And third, these persons were conceived in individualized imaginary "character portraits," distinguished not only by attributes - musical instruments and the beloved wine-cups - but also by expressive features giving the illusion of real faces, by eloquent gestures and, most conspicuously, by their poses and attitudes which are strikingly unconstrained, free and easy - sometimes even indecent (by Confucian standards), with garments loose, legs and feet bare - and yet not lacking in noblesse and dignity. Evidently the accomplishments of "realistic" drawing that had resulted in the richly varied "character figures" of the Ch'in and Han periods were more and more 8 Alexander C.

Compared with the typified figures in Ku K'ai-chih's nearly contemporaneous paintings in the narrative mode (as far as we know them by the early copies of the Admonitions and Nymph of the Lo River scrolls), the Seven Sages show a higher degree of personal characterization - much higher than anything that had been previously possible. (Stylistically, they have in common with Ku K'ai-chih the elegantly rhythmic play of curved garment contours.) In the Seven Sages we have the first attempt at giving ing individual persons a pictorial identity by creating specific images that do not repeat old types and cliches any longer but take a resolute step towards real portraiture - of necessity in a limited form. If real portraits did exist at all in those times - which is by no means impossible - they probably were more formal and ceremonial, in conformity with their social function and the prevailing decorum so deliberately shunned by the Seven Sages. Although portraits of the fourth and fifth centuries - imagined or "real" ones - do not exist any more we know quite a lot about the leading portraitist of the time: Ku K'ai-chih, whose name ac- quired canonical authority for the future; his biography in the seventh-century Chin-shui (chitan 92),9 complemented by some other sources, gives much information about him, factual and anecdotal. (As long as the credibility of these statements has not been definitely disproved we may accept them as containing at least a grain of truth.) Living in the same region of southeastern China, Ku K'ai-chih was a near-contemporary of the first Seven Sages series and may have seen the paintings of which the tomb reliefs were copies. It seems that his character and talents fitted well into the unconventional personality pattern represented by the Sages; he was said to have excelled in three perfections: paint- ing, wit and foolery. Among many other subjects Ku K'ai-chih painted portraits of contemporaries as well as historical persons. His only works to have come down to us at least in early copies, the Admonitions and the Nymph of the Lo River handscrolls, are illustrations of texts in the narrative mode and do not help us to form an idea of his portraits. But what is told in his biography indicates a keen and competent awareness of the problems inherent in portraiture and is interesting in several points. First of all we find the locus classicus for the definition of portraiture which remained valid ever since: ch'uan-shen hsieh-chao: "transmission of the spirit by depicting the appearance." This clearly shows that now a degree of verisimilitude was held to be indispensable in order to capture a person's inner nature. How meticulous and sensitive Ku K'ai-chih was in accomplishing this task is revealed by his habit of inserting the pupils of the eyes only after the lapse of several years because, he said, the life or spirit of a portrait depends just on these little spots (and, we may add, because in those times the eyes may have had a "magic" power). Faced with the delicate problem of portraying a gentleman with a defective eye, Ku K'ai-chih applied the subtle technique of veiling the pupil with a slight touch of ink "like thin clouds over the moon," a technique here and henceforth called "skimmed white (fei- p1i)." The character of a sitter who felt himself more at home in natural surroundings than among officials at court was conveyed by showing him between rocks. (The "ambiente portrait" later became a popular type mainly for the presentation of poets, monks and literati.) All these glimpses (they are no more than that) clearly indicate a remarkable advance in the art of portraiture, not only as far as the correct depiction of the outer appearance is concerned but also, and in the first place, the seizure 9 Chen Shih-hsiang, Biography of Ku K'ai-chih (Chinese Dynastic Histories Translations z) (Berkeley: University of California Press, I953).

Because Ku K'ai-chih succeeded just in this supreme achievement he was awarded, by some writers at least, the highest rank - no wonder that his reputation remained uncontested, even sacrosanct, throughout the history of Chinese painting. Whether and to what degree Ku K'ai-chih's portraits and those of his equally famous colleague Lu T'an-wei (ca. 440-500) - of which we know nothing - were true likenesses in the sense we under- stand the term is questionable; when dealing with such an early, still experimental phase we always have to remember Gombrich's statement: "Different periods are known to have had different standards of 'lifelikeness'." But we have to recognize that the Chinese since these early times - and with increasing emphasis later - insisted on a correct depiction of individual features which were not allowed to be neglected if the proper purpose of portraits, to capture the "spirit," should not be missed. Consistently, Hsieh Ho (writing around 500) - himself a portraitist of not undisputed rank - included in his famous Six Principles as No. 3 the "Correspondence to the object which means the depicting of forms (ying-wu hsiang-hsing)." Chinese art theory and criticism, at least before literati aesthetics came to dominate, has constantly been concerned with the problems of "portraiture" or "portrayal" in the double sense of the English words: correct depiction or graphic description in general and making an individual's likeness. 5. T'ang Portraits In portraiture the T'ang period is no longer a preparatory or initial phase but - according to a wealth of textual information and even some original works luckily preserved - one of full maturity and basic achievements which could serve as the starting position and classic standard not only for future developments in China but also in Korea and Japan. The evolutionary steps, however, leading from the formative phase of the Chin period to this advanced state, escape our observation; let us hope that a few of the missing links will some time be discovered. The general standard reached in T'ang figure painting is impressively documented by the original murals in the tombs of two imper- ial princes and a princess (Chang-huai, I-te and Yung-t'ai) erected around the year 706, and by such a powerfully characteristic male head as that from the tomb of Lady Hsiieh (7I0; fig. I2), not to mention the Tun-huang murals and the well-known scrolls attributed to leading T'ang masters and preserved in copies. We know for certain that now true likenesses were quite common and that eminent artists excelled in the genre, such as Yen Li-pen (died 673), Ch'en Hung (Ist half 8th century), Han Kan (active 742-756) and Chou Fang (ca. 766-804) who also painted many other subjects - Han Kan even specializing in portraits of individual horses. The human figure (jen-wu) ranked first in the subject-matter scale (or second, after religious themes), the portrait forming a sub- genre of figure painting.?1 As to portrait sculpture, we know from texts that T'ang emperors, mainly Hsiian-tsung, had their images installed in Buddhist and Taoist temples as well as in palace halls, but what they looked like is left to our imagination - unless w rea allowed to take as a guide-post the (hitherto unique) seated stone statue in the tomb of Wang Chien (847-9I8), the ruler of the short-lived Former Shu Dynasty; IO Lothar Ledderose, "Subject Matter in Early Chinese Painting Criticism," Oriental Art, 19, no. I (Spring I973):69-83. 21</page><page sequence="16">the face gives the impression of a certain degree of individual characterization." Monks' statues were at that time made in great numbers; we even have a few original examples which will be discussed below. To draw a sharp borderline between "character portraits," "imaginary portraits" and "real portraits" which probably existed side by side is almost impossible due to the scarcity of original works. Siren, speaking of the Eight Noble Officials scroll in the Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City, attributed to Ch'en Hung and possibly near-contemporary, says that he was a "character painter, not exactly a portraitist..., but an artist who could transmit the character of his models through their types as well as through their gestures and attitudes, not to mention details of costume and attributes."I2 This interpretation is convincing in view of the fact that all those officials belonged to the Northern and Southern Dynasties so that their looks had to be imagined by a T'ang painter. The same may be true of the two scrolls in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Thirteen Emperors and Scholars Collating Texts, probably early copies after originals attributed to Yen Li-pen; in the case of the former there is a slight possibility that some more recent emperors (whose identification is inaccurate) may have features as they were known to a T'ang painter by tradition. Anyhow these scrolls give us an impression of what portraits from the aristocratic and the scholarly sphere may have looked like. A typical and outstanding imaginary portrait, freely invented by an eminent artist (although certainly not Wang Wei to whom it used to be attributed), is a very charming picture in the Osaka Municipal Museum (Abe Collection), probably a careful copy of the ninth-tenth century (fig. IO): the aged scholar Fu Sheng of the late third century B.C. explaining a classic text which he had saved from the destruction of books under Ch'in Shih-huang-ti - a key work of this phase of Chinese portraiture. It is a descendant of the Seven Sages type but now a much greater amount of lifelikeness could be infused into such a highly individualized image so that it almost seems to be a true portrait. T'ang artists, even when visualizing imaginary portraits, could certainly rely on a rich reservoir of observa- tion drawn from the world around them, and more often than we imagine such a portrait may actu- ally be based on a carefully duplicated living model, as a de facto portrait of some anonymous person. "Real or true portraits" were certainly produced in great numbers, finding competent and critical response with those who commissioned and received them. This is vividly illustrated by the story of how two portraits of a Mr. Chao Tsung, painted by leading masters, first by Han Kan and later by Chou Fang, were shown to his wife; being asked whom they portrayed, she replied, "My husband, Vice-President Chao." Further asked about which of the two was the better likeness, she answered, "Both are like him, but the second is the better; the first has merely mastered my husband's features, but the other has also conveyed his expression; it has caught his personality and the way he looks when he is speaking with a smile;" and she could correctly identify Chou Fang as its painter.13 An earlier case is reported from the Liang Dynasty: when Crown Prince Wu-lieh (Hsiao Fang-teng, mid- 6th century) showed the portraits he had done of his guests to his little boys they were able to give II Edward H.

If this story is reliable it would give a glimpse of a preparatory phase leading from Eastern Chin to T'ang portraiture.I4 Fortunately three original works from the T'ang period, more specifically between the mid-eighth and the mid-ninth centuries, have come down to us which may tentatively be called the incunabulae of Chinese portraiture. All of them represent monks of high standing who lived in this flourishing time of Chinese Buddhism. Only one, the latest, is still located in China, the other two belong to the rich Chinese heritage so fortunately preserved in Japan. Of course there exists no definite proof of their being true portraits but, in view of the circumstances and the chronology of their production, they all have a relatively good chance to be acceptable as authentic by coming near to their models' real physiognomies. In spite of its fragile material (clay) the memorial statue of Hung-pien is preserved in good condition in grotto No. I7 ofTun-huang (fig. I4). Hung-pien was a prominent prelate in that region in the middle of the ninth century; his life and career are recorded on a stele in the same grotto which he had established in the decade preceding his death around 86I. His life-sized (94.0 cm high) seated statue which certainly was made and installed soon after his death has a small cavity in its back, where a silk bag, wrapped in paper, was found containing his ashes. The lifelike face radiates energy, inspiration, inner serenity and gives the impression of immediate personal presence. Almost ex-actly a century earlier, another eminent Chinese monk had been portrayed in a memorial statue in Japan: Chien-chen (ap. Gan-jin, 687-763) who had come to Japan in 754 in order to implant there the Vinaya School and to establish thte Toshodaiji at Nara as its headquarters. There his life-sized statue (81.7 cm high), enshrined in a chapel, has been preserved and venerated to this day (fig. 13). Made in the hollow dry-lacquer technique, probably immediately after his death by one of his disciples, it is an entirely Chinese-inspired work; it shows Chien-chen in deep meditation with an expression of detachment and tranquillity, combining this in an admirable way with a slight indication of the blindness that had afflicted him before his arrival in Japan. How lifelike and personal the features of this seemingly Buddha-like image actually are becomes impressively clear when the face is compared with that of a contemporary Buddha statue whose features are highly idealized as a symbol of superhuman perfection in personal form, while the monk's face shows the individual irregularities of an empirical person. The third of those T'ang portraits is that of Amoghavajra (Pu-k'ung Chin-kang, Jap. Fuku Kongo, 705-774), a monk of Indian, Singhalese or "Western" origin, who spent the greater part of his life in China; there he helped to establish the esoteric Vajrayana School (mi-tsung or chen-yen, Jap. mikkyo or shin-gon) and played an important role under imperial patronage - one of the great Buddhist patriarchs of East Asia. The portrait (fig. I5) belongs to a series of five paintings showing Indian and Chinese masters that were done by Li Chen and given to the Japanese monk Kukai (774- 835, later Kobo-Daishi) before he returned to his homeland after years of study in China; they have been kept ever since in the Toji at Kyoto founded by Kukai but are now in a deplorable condition. The Chinese teacher from whom he received them, Hui-kuo (746-805), was a pupil of Amoghavajra, and it is perhaps not too hazardous to assume that this close personal filiation in the direct teacher/pupil sequence of three generations, in one and the same circumscribed area of two monasteries in the T'ang capital Ch'ang-an, made it possible to portray him correctly: Hui-kuo and I4 Yen Chih-t'ui, Yen-shih chia-hsu'n; Alexander C. Soper, Textual Evidencefor the Secular Arts of China (Artibus Asiae Supplementum 24) (Ascona: Artibus Asiae, I967):I2. 23</page><page sequence="18">the painter must have been well acquainted with his personality and his features. The conspicuously un-Chinese face, lean, ascetic, full of ecstatic devoutness and great energy, is so characteristic and differs so much from the normal Chinese patriarch type that I believe we may accept the painting as an authentic or nearly authentic likeness. Just as the statue of Chien-chen, the Amoghavajra portrait became the prototype or "basic portrait" for almost all later representations of him; the oldest of them, no doubt directly copied from the Toji original, is a wall-painting on wooden boards in the ground-floor chapel of the Daigoji pagoda near Kyoto, erected in 95I (fig. I6). As is well known, cosmopolitan T'ang China was visited by enormous numbers of foreigners from all parts of Asia - ambassadors, tribute-bearers, merchants, monks, musicians, servants and showmen. We know them mainly through the ceramic tomb figurines - which are never portraits but in many cases convincing, though typified character-figures - and through some pictorial documents such as the murals in the princely tombs mentioned above, or the Sung copy of a handscroll showing Foreign Envoys in the Historical Museum, Peking (fig. II), attributed to Hsiao I, the later Liang ruler Yiian-ti (505-557), who is said to have portrayed foreign travellers during his term as provincial governor.15 The familiarity with so many racial varieties must have stimulated the Chinese artists in their physiognomical interest, giving them ample opportunity to observe and depict the most heterogeneous types. Here a sort of "exotic realism" was developed which perfectly lends itself to the production of character-figures but must also have enhanced the skill of the portraitists. Especially when they had to depict Buddhist monks and patriarchs they were often confronted with foreign types from different regions of India and Central Asia. And whenever they were allowed freely to invent figures like the Buddhist Arhats (lohan) - all of them bearing Indian names - they used this exotic realism with great virtuosity for highly expressive, sometimes grotesque, even superhuman character types which are thus elevated to symbolic significance. The "normal," commonplace variety of realistic depiction, without such fantastic exaggerations, was exactly adequate for portraits of patriarchs and monks since realism in Buddhist art, on a stylistically "low" level, corresponds to the inferior ontological level of the Samsara realm of existence; this religious motivation of realism evidently converged with the general tendency of T'ang culture and art toward getting hold of the real world in all its aspects. It seems that monk portraits therefore arrived at a true depiction of individual features earlier than secular ones. Not in China but in Japan the available material allows a comparison: almost contemporaneously with the portrait statue of Chien-hen (mid 8th en (mid 8th century) and in the same ambente of the Nara imperial court, the portrait of the Regent-Prince Shotoku with two young princes (Imperial Collection, Tokyo) was painted - a thoroughly unrealistic, puppet-like figure which seems to be a simplified version of a T'ang model perhaps like the Boston Emperors scroll; social and ceremonial reasons precluded a more lifelike depiction. In Japan realism in secular portraiture continued to be inappropriate until the end of the twelfth century; in China it is difficult to observe the contemporary development due to insufficient material. The remarkable prevalence of realistic lifelikeness in monks' portraits is probably connected with the phenomenon of "temporal incorruptibility" (as Needham called it16): since at least the sixth 15 Li-tai ming-hua chi, translated by Acker (see note 9) vol. 2, I69. Reproduced: Chung-kuo Mei-shu Ch'uan-chi, Hui-hua, loc. cit., no. 99. I Needham, loc. cit., vol. 5, part 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974), 282 ff. and 294 ff.; fig. I330. Further references in Croissant, see note 17. 24</page><page sequence="19">century not a few Buddhist monks aspired, with the aid of rigorous ascetic austerities and probably of drugs, at a death in deep meditation so that their body could be preserved without decay, taken care of by their disciples and set up for veneration in a stupa, grotto or chapel. Taking Sakyamuni's great disciple Mahakasyapa as their model, they hoped to await the arrival of Maitreya, the saviour of the next aeon; possibly the idea of "becoming a Buddha in the present body" (chi-shen ch'eng-fo, Jap. sokzu- shin jo-butsuz) may also have given a motivation, and it is probable that ancient Taoist physiological practices and mystic experiences were involved. Many cases of "immortal bodies" of monks - with their desiccated corpses preserved and solidified by a coating of lacquer - are recorded and some exist to this day; the most renowned, that of Hui-neng (638-7I3), the Sixth Ch'an (Zen) Patriarch, was demolished during the infamous "cultural revolution." Between this "presence in reality" and the "presence in an image," i.e. a portrait statue, seems to exist a genetic connection,I7 and the image can be understood not only as a representation but as an "embodiment" of the real person in an almost literal sense or as a substitute - provided that it is a truly realistic likeness. (Most monks' statues in seated position in fact have a life-size height of between 80 and 95 centimeters.) This seems to be one of the reasons why monks' portraits had priority in the degree of realism and why the earliest veritable portrait statues (as opposed to paintings) that are known to us are those of monks. Even before T'ang times such statues were also used as reliquaries, the ashes of the deceased being deposited - or more literally incorporated - in their hollow interior or a cavity so that bodily presence and spiritual identity was assured; the case ofHung-pien was mentioned above. But "T'ang realism," as it may justly be called, had a much broader basis and wider range of application since it is the result of a general and fundamental "discovery of Man and the World" (to borrow Burckhardt's formula for the Renaissance) which meant a universal and profound under- standing and appropriation of reality and its faithful, mimetic description in all forms of repre- sentational art; one of them, specifically calling for lifelike depiction, was the portrait. However, it must not be overlooked that in China the degree of realistic representation in portraiture never went to extremes because this was prevented by a strong tendency to formal reserve and sublimation which is the visible equivalent of the conditions governing Chinese social life (from which the monks were to a certain degree exempted): the strictness of the hierarchic system, the rules of rank and dignity, the ceremonials of intercourse, the "rites" (1i) to be observed, the life-style regulated by a rigid decorum. All this was instrumental in preventing Chinese portraiture from any kind of overstatement and in guaranteeing its specific noble, moderately realistic style and its remarkable constancy throughout all subsequent transformations. 17 Doris Croissant, "Der unsterbliche Leib: Ahnen-Effigies und Reliquien-Portrat in der Portrat-Plastik Chinas und Japans," Das Bildnis in der Kunst des Orients (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, I990):243-268.
