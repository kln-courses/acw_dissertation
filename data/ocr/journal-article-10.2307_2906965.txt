<plain_text><page sequence="1">XERGA AND THE CHANGING MET- APHOR ` ANTONINO MUSUMECI O "The poet is he who, beneath the named, constantly expected differ- ences, rediscovers the buried kinships between things, their scattered re- semblances." (M. Foucault) From the earliest definitions of its nature to the more recent attempts to explore its mechanism and to measure its import, metaphor has been projected as not just a simple literary ornamentation, but as a veritable posture toward reality, as the resultant image of a process of perception. For Aristotle, metaphor implies the existence of an affinity of meaning in the fragments of reality, of a blue-print that would assure the logical organization of the polymorphic impressions of the empirical experience ("to be able to discover beautiful metaphors is to be able to capture the mutual likeness of things" Poetics, 1459 e). Vico, while proposing the essentialness of figurative language to man's epistemological process, asserts specifically the power of metaphor to tame the irrational chaos, suggesting by implication that metaphor is to cognition what culture is to collectivity ("Alle cose insensate da' senso ogni metafora" Scienza Nuova, 1.2). Jakobson's concept of a dichotomous polarity in linguistic performance-the metaphoric and the metonymic-identifies with metapor the development of a discourse on the basis of similarity or analogy, rather than contiguity or association.' We constantly try to define the unknown 1 R.Jakobson and M. Halle,Fundamentals ofLanguage (The Hague: Mouton, 1956), pp. 55-82.

We perceive relationships, establish systems of parameters, attempt to structure the variety of the data into a logical linearity. Metaphors are not simply beautiful; they also allow us to venture into the unexplored and to place it within a space delimited by reassuring coordinates. Because of the multiplicity of definitions given about metaphor, we should initially delimit the range here attributed to the terminology in question. Between the linguist and the literary critic there has been, particularly of late, a diversity of approach to metaphoric expression. Since my present concern is stylistic rather than linguistic in nature, I intend to use the term "metaphor" in its widest connotation, as a process of identification of one thing with another for a cognitive purpose. As such, I do not admit of substantive differences between metaphor and comparison, for both derive from an observed affinity between an original term and a "metaphoric" term. Aristotle had asserted that "comparison is a metaphor" (Rhetoric, 1406 b), and in that vein Quintilian has offered what has become the standard definition: "metaphora brevior est similitude" (Institutio oratoria, VIII, 6, 8)-echoed recently by S. Ullmann: "la metaphore est en derniere analyse une comparaison en raccourci."2 I consider metaphor/comparison to be the rapprochement of two entities (whether on the basis of identity or of similarity I deem not significant), founded on an affinity of meaning between them, so that by the projection or proximity of one to the other, an otherwise opaque nuance of the original term is revealed. In reading Verga's work, notwithstanding some recent attempts at re-evaluating his earlier novels, one is impressed by the qualitative change between succeeding stages of his narrative, to which corresponds an equally significant change in the application of formal devices, thus implying a variance in the very code of interpretation. The journey from Una peccatrice (1866) and Eros (1875) to I Malavoglia (1881) and Mastro don Gesualdo (1889) involves more than a simple acceptance of the esthetic principles of Verismo; it suggests also a shift in the perception of the role of the author, but above all it signifies a different emotional and cognitive approach to 2 Pricis de simantiquefrancaise (Berne: Francke, 1959), p. 277.

The purpose of this paper is to follow the vicissitudinousjourney of a minimal element of Verga's ecriture-the metaphor-as it progresses through these stages, specifically from Eros to I Malavoglia. The choice is perhaps significant, for Eros is Verga's last novel before the "documento umano" of the story of the house by the medlar tree.3 Eros, above all, is not a love story. Rather, it is a quasi-deterministic account of an innocence which progressively decays into corruption, and of its inability to establish any satisfactory relationship with innocents and corrupted alike. The novel ends with an exasperated gesture; and as the curtain closes, a gun-shot is heard from behind the backdrop. That exasperation is equally evident also in the use of stylistic devices. Metaphors are overly abundant, repetitious, distant; they soon become predictable, thus failing to surprise the reader and to aggregate an additional tonality to the original term. Often the metaphoric term is borrowed from literature, as if a literary cliche could reveal the sores of an existential reality ("accento da Otello" p. 30; "tiro di lungo con la guardinga disinvoltura di un cospiratore di melodramma" p. 32; "come ogni Cesare che stia per passare un Rubicone" p. 33; "come tanti Don Chisciotti" p. 165), orit is mediated from mythology, not ironically as Parini would, nor epistemologically as Pavese did, but as an attempt to create an impossible superlative which demiurgically would transform the ordinary into the extraordinary ("modellata come una Venere" pp. 17 and 70; "svelto e gentile come una statua d'Ebe" p. 17; "come un Apollo brutto" p. 86). The semantic cluster which provides the metaphoric agent is a filter twice removed from reality, and it expresses an intentionality imposed from above, exterior to that reality, which ultimately remains untouched, unexplained, veiled in its own opacity. Similarly the exterior trappings of an artificial world (that of. the marchese Alberto Alberti, the protagonist) are subsumed as terms of comparison for situations of real immediacy: titles of nobility ("sicurezza da regina" pp. 29, 47 and 164; "come una sultana" p. 47; "come una granduchessa" p. 72), objects of a rococo flavor ("l'amore irradiavasi come una specie d'aureola" pp. 35 and 158; "imbottito di seta come un elegante scatolino" p. 43; "brillavano come le lenti di una lanterna magica" p. 44; "sembrava una statua di 3All quotations and page numbers refer to the following editions of Verga's work: Eros (Verona: Biblioteca Moderna Mondadori, 1965), and I Malavoglia (Verona: Edizioni Scolastiche Mondadori, 1967).</page><page sequence="4">M L N 55 marmo" pp. 49 and 143; "ventaglio come uno scettro" p. 164), clothing of haute couture ("leggiadra come un figurino di mode" p. 17; "leggiera come il tulle" p. 43; "nebuloso come la mussolina" p. 53; "a guisa di manto reale" p. 90; "lasciarlo come un guanto" p. 161), the capricious and outmoded art of duelling ("scambiarono un'occhiata che avrebbe potuto dirsi 1 luccicare di due spade da duellanti" pp. 44, 61 and 79; "occhi scintillanti come armi omicide" p. 115; "gli trafiggeva il cuore come una punta di ferro arroventato" p. 121). The problematical inference is that, while the author's attitude is typically moralistic, thus condemnatory of this artificial world, that which has been condemned and declared false is also used metaphorically as revelatory for a vital category of being. It is significant that the largest group of metaphoric terms appropriated by Verga in Eros are chosen from a reservoir of popular expressions, consacrated by usage but also deflated by it. These are not simply idiomatic utterances, but associations that have lost their power to move, coupled by linguistic custom ab antiquo, and as such have wasted their ability to reveal by unsuspected proximity: "si avanzo a passi di lupo" (p. 33), "il sangue le corse come una vampa in tutte le vene (p. 40), "sorriso falso, come un colpevole" (pp. 53 and 66), "sparn come un lampo" (pp. 55, 143 and 164), "impalato quasi fosse stato di sasso" (pp. 57, 92 and 176), "sguardi da Giuda" (p. 64), "a guisa d'uomo colpito dal fulmine" (p. 65), "occhi ardenti come carboni" (p. 66), "parti per Firenze, di nascosto, come un ladro" (p. 68), "bella come un amore" (p. 70), "soffriva come un dannato" (p. 89), "fortunato come un milionario" (p. 96), "come un uomo che ha la febbre" (p. 96), "triste come un mortorio" (p. 102), "entro come una spiritata" (p. 119), "gli andava come un guanto" (p. 122), "buttato fra i piedi come una limosina" (p. 165), "fredda come il marmo" (p. 187), "tetro come un fantasma" (p. 188). In reality these are not conceptually true metaphors, although they appear disguised as such, for they do not add to the comprehension of the original idea. They are dead metaphors, linguistic remorae absorbed into the verbal medium; they are not explorations in depth. They are mute companions that have exhausted their revelatory capability-associations dictated by custom, not by poetic inventiveness. The most telling instance is offered by the treatment given to colors. With only one exception ("rossa come un tacchino" p. 95, which will reappear in I Malavoglia, p. 64), all metaphoric couplings in Eros are to the color white-for pallor is here more than</page><page sequence="5">56 ANTONINO MUSUMECI a simple color; it constitutes a pervasive presence, an atmosphere, a modus vivendi: "come alabastro" (p. 23), "come un cencio" (pp. 57, 84 and 108), "da Caino" (p. 64), "come uno spettro" (p. 64), "come il marmo" (pp. 71 and 96), "come cera" (pp. 128 and 132), "come il colletto di tela" (p. 143), "come una statua" (p. 180), "come il sepolcro" (p. 183). All of these are literary and oral cliches which do not define whiteness metaphorically, but present it in its frozen traditional perception. They do not afford us a privileged intrusion into its aura; but after the promise, they leave us standing in front of an unopened door. An additional large category of metaphoric terms in Eros, as in literature in general, is provided by nature. Almost exclusively, Verga has recourse to nature in an auxiliary function to describe fear, vulnerability, precariousness, or the cause of such state: the beauty and the beast-metaphor of fright: "tremava come le foglie agitate dalla brezza" (p. 31), "esitante, a guisa di un uccello spaurito che batte le ali" (p. 31), "manine tremavano come foglie" (p. 36), "scappo come una cerbiatta spaventata" (p. 37), "come una cerbiatta attorniata da una muta di cani" (p. 45); and metaphor of the frightening: "luccicava di tanto in tanto come una lingua serpentina" (p. 44), "sentiva dentro di se certo mugolio tempestoso, somigliante al vento" (p. 63), "occhi scintillare nel buio come quelli di una belva" (p. 64), "il dubbio mi rode come un verme velenoso" (p. 80), "frusciare i lembi del vestito come un sibilo di serpente irritito" (p. 112), "si precipito su di lei come un leone innamorato" (p. 115), "distese mollemente le braccia con un movimento di tigre" (p. 128). The metaphoric term is adopted as descriptive of the extremities of an emotional situation, and as such it may signify the inability to capture it, to verbalize its nature. Metaphor then becomes not a privileged form of excavation into the hidden meaning of things as revealed in their subcutaneous kinships, but a concession to the unfathomable, an escape into figurative language with a desperate faith in its magical power to convey what has not been seized. It shows an author subservient to his techniques, who trusts them to reveal gratuitously or at least to hide his uncertain distance. It is significant that often in Eros the metaphoric term, which is by nature definitory, is itself general, undetermined, unqualified thus unqualifying. The bird category provides an emblematic illustration: "cinguettando come allegri uccelletti" (p. 15), "dolce favella della fanciulla toscana che somiglia a cinguettio d'uccelletto"</page><page sequence="6">M L N 57 (p. 25), "brillavano al sole come rapide ali di uccello" (p. 43). The image remains vague for it is dependent on the strain of the diminutive while the controlling figure ("uccello") persists in its indistinct generalization. As a result the metaphoric process is reduced to an innocuous aggregation of objects. The basic operation is analogous to the alchemist's combination of elements in the elusive hope that gold may be produced fortuitously from it. In Eros metaphors tend to mushroom any time the author is confronted with situations of great tension, of marked emotional potential, thus exhibiting an inability to cope with reality directly, an effort to disfigure it by inflating it. Metaphor becomes an extraordinary technique, reserved for extraordinary events; not an inroad into the quotidian, but its masking. Thus tension is derived from verbal exasperation, rather than from the ingredients of the situation itself; it is superimposed from above, it does not exude from within. Since phenomenologically we possess our thoughts through our verbal expression, Verga's metaphoric process reveals a conceptual statement rather than an existential mimicry. The existential meaning which should inhabit the word has been replaced by a frozen utterance, by another literary word. In Eros, metaphors are not expansive, but restrictive; they do not add significantly; they do not mark a progression, but indicate an ornamental accumulation. They are not vibrantly compromising, but echo cliches of a diffused perception. They seem to erect a protective screen between the author and the immediacy of reality-a technique typical of Petrarch also, and of Tasso, and in general of the ontologically insecure person. They are not adventurous projections toward the unknown, but revert to a fossilized, improbable term of a mute relationship, like an idol which has long since spoken its last oracle. I Malavoglia opens with a metaphor: "Un tempo i Malavoglia erano stati numerosi come i sassi della strada vecchia di Trezza" (p. 15). Against the background of Eros, we are faced with an unusual metaphoric connection, horizontal rather than vertical. It establishes an almost mythical dimension by projecting the antecedent of the story on a level of a-temporality ("un tempo" and "vecchia"), and on that level the relationship Malavoglia&gt; sassi, although predicated in terms of numericality, suggests also, through the obliqueness of language, implications of durability and familiarity, reliability and authenticity. This tonality, established</page><page sequence="7">58 ANTONINO MUSUMECI here in the overture of the novel, will become typical and reveal a new proximity and involvement of the author with reality. The relevance of gestures as vehicles for feelings has already been shown;4 we would like to insist on a similar importance inherent in the metaphoric imagery as explicator of an existential condition. There is, besides "sassi," a whole cluster of metaphoric terms used to describe the Malavoglias, and they all refer to collective entities, for this is indeed the drama of a collectivity (as the Italian title suggests) strained from within and from without by divisive forces: padron 'Ntoni's favorite metaphor, that of the complementarity of the fingers of the hand ("la famiglia di padron 'Ntoni era realmente disposta come le dita della mano" p. 16); the ceremonial parade ("quando entravano in chiesa, l'uno dietro l'altro, pareva una processione" p. 18); the chicken-coop ("siamo sempre come i pulcini nella stoppa" pp. 103, 204 and 243); the ant-hill ("facciamo come le formiche" pp. 213, 126, 232, 241 and 265). It is readily evident that the quotidian not the extraordinary, the familiar not the exotic is assumed as the explicating term. No literary or mythological mediation is postulated; no juxtaposition of artificial affinities is imposed; instead the association is perceived on the level where the action develops, it springs latitudinally from within the confines of the description-the illumination comes from reality itself, thus granting it a sense of authenticity, the comfort of domestic assurance. Necessarily from that premise derives an incompatibility for the heroic, the grandiose, the magniloquent. In fact this process of diminution is a fundamental element in the "new language" of the novel, and draws from the banality of the ordinary its images and its verbalization. Only two metaphoric terms are "modern," in so far as they refer to a mechanized, industrial correspondent: "il vento si mise a fischiare al pari della macchina della ferrovia" (p. 195), and "qui ci vorrebbero le braccia di ferro come la macchina a vapore" (p. 197). But both have already begun to enter the periphery of the familiar, significantly as negative forces, thus losing the mythical mask which the telegraph instead still retains. It is from within the narrow horizon of this periphery that the comparison derives its measure: "piantato come un pilastro su quei piedacci che sembravano pale di ficodindia" (p. 20); "ragazzi che annaspavano, 4 T. Wlassics, "I gesti dei Malavoglia," Lettere italiane XXIII(1971), 187-96.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 59 col capo fuori dagli sportelli, come fanno i buoi quando sono condotti alla fiera" (p. 22); "la stella della sera era gia' bella e lucente, che pareva una lanterna appesa all'antenna della Provvidenza" (p. 31); "il cielo formicolava di stelle che parevano le monachine quando corrono sul fondo nero della padella" (p. 91); "la gente muore come le mosche" (pp. 78 and 80); "il cuore ... se ne va a pezzo a pezzo, come le robe vecchie si disfanno nel bucato" (p. 234); "le parole andavano come la carrucola di un pozzo" (p. 319). There is more here than the tendency typical of primitive peoples, as Vico attests, to employ a metaphoric language; what transpires is the need to give a tangible face to imponderables, to solidify an impression by associating it with concrete imagery, to seize the unknown through known categories, to soften the impact of reality by relating it to inconspicuous fragments of everyday experience. The description of the battle of Lyssa, while underlining the extraneousness of the world of Aci Trezza to Italy's historical destiny and the incongruity of militaristic enterprises when seen against the sobering background of human suffering, evidences this process of diminution through association with the commonplace, thus revealing a genuine perception of the human condition: "un bastimento come non ce n'erano altri, colla corazza, vuol dire come chi dicesse voi altre donne che avete il busto," "un fumo come se ci fossero state venti fornaci di mattone" (p. 165); "Una battaglia. Chi l'ha persa? lo, voi, tutti insomma, l'Italia; ... e come quando il Comune di Aci Trezza litigava pel territorio col Comune di Aci Castello" (p. 166); "e come all'osteria, allorche ci si scalda la testa, e volano i piatti e i bicchieri in mezzo al fumo ed alle grida," "alla prima cannonata, e come incomincia il parapiglia, vi vien voglia di ballare anche voi, che non vi terrebbero le catene, come quando suona il violino all'osteria," "i compagni vi fioccano d'attorno come pere fradice" (p. 167); "la 'Palestro', la quale ardeva come una catasta di legno" (p. 168)-the sights and sounds of war, seen and heard not from the distance of the chronicler, but from the emotional proximity of those who are destroyed by it. The mechanism involved in the creation and assumption of nicknames in the novel unveils the relationship between reality and ontology through the medium of metaphoric linkage. As in the Old Testament, here too a name reveals a quality of being and defines a destiny. Zio Crocifisso, who "dimenava il capo che pareva una campana senza batocchio davvero" (p. 28), is called "Campana di</page><page sequence="9">60 ANTONINO MUSUMECI legno," and that label proclaims his behavior and his role in the society of Aci Trezza. Comare Mena "non si vede, ma si sente, e sta al telaio notte e giorno, come Sant'Agata" (p. 34), and as the saint she too becomes a martyr of domestic virtues. We will not be surprised if La Vespa, true to her namesake, "sfodero la lingua come un pungiglione" (p. 77). An extrinsic quality (physical or behavioral), in a process reminiscent of Homer's fixed metaphors, dictates a name, and that name in turn establishes a quality of being. We can foresee that Brasi Cipolla eventually will be named "Baccala" for he is repeatedly alluded to with that association (pp. 126 and 135)-a nickname in fieri. Maruzza, who at the outset already possesses a label ("la Longa"), because of her destiny of sorrow acquires a new name ("la Addolorata") which describes her function of maternity coupled with pain, the pain of too many departures and too few returns ("zitta zitta sul ballatoio, come la Madonna addolorata" p. 112). Here too metaphors are not added as dispensable ornamentations, but are an integral part of the process, created by it and creating it in turn. The sea is to the world of the Malavoglias more than a body of water: it is a source of livelihood, a perennial enemy to be conquered, an uncontrollable force of destruction, and also a limitless reservoir of metaphoric elements that can decode the mysteries of existence, a pool of archetypal revelations that years of familiarity have deciphered and codified into dicta of wisdom. The sea and the life at sea provide in the novel the majority of the terms of comparison-life explaining life, struggle giving meaning to struggle. They allow to penetrate into patterns of behavior ("e fatto come i merluzzi, che abboccherebbero un chiodo arruginito" pp. 24-25;5 "aveva il cuore grande come il mare" p. 87; "la bile andava gonfiandosi da un uscio all'altro come le onde del mare in burrasca" p. 123); they offer a shape to an undefinable anguish ("padron 'Ntoni, piegato in due, piu vecchio di cent'anni, la guardava, e la guardava, scrollando il capo, e non sapeva che dire, per quella grosse spina di Bastianazzo che ci aveva in cuore, come se lo rosicasse un pescecane" p. 65); they analyze an economic predicament ("se ne va indietro al modo dei gamberi, come i Malavoglia" p. 84); they provide graphic diagnostic descriptions ("la sciatica piegava il vecchio come un uncino" pp. 97 and 119; "il piui del tempo lo passava 5 See G. Raya, "Metafore e logica della fame," La lingua del Verga (Florence: Le Monnier, 1962), pp. 43-50.</page><page sequence="10">M L N 61 in letto, come un gambero sotto i ciottoli, abbaiando peggio di un cane" p. 330); they give unofficial accounts of unsuccessful police action ("mi sono sgusciati di mano come anguille" p. 143); they externalize an uneasy self-perception ("ora che non c'&amp; piui la mamma mi sento come un pesce fuori dell'acqua" p. 245); they suggest distrust for the written documents of a culture to which the protagonists are alien ("quegli sgorbj, che sembravano ami di pesceluna, e non potevano dir nulla di buono" p. 26); they define other foci of collective living ("la bettola e come un porto di mare" p. 299, and "adesso la casa era grande come il mare" p. 325). On the other hand, a complementarity is suggested on some elemental, pre-logical level, through a constant process of anthropomorphic and animistic identification: "il mare si udiva muggire attorno ai fariglioni che pareva ci fossero riuniti i buoi della fiera di Sant'Alfio" (p. 48); "i sugheri ballavano sull'acqua tutto il giorno, come se ci fosse chi suonava il violino" (p. 192); "il mare friggeva tutto intorno come il pesce nella padella" (p. 192); "la vela si gonfiava come la gonnella di donna Rosolina" (p. 193). This poetry of association (and the generalization is valid for the novel as a whole) is characterized by a certain naturalness with the text; it derives from the lexical and semantic level of the story, from a forma mentis accustomed to associating with an experiential substratum in which all things seem to have a meaning or seek one. As a result objects not only acquire an intense degree of authenticity, but pulsate with a life of their own, travelling their cyclic journey from life to death, from joy to sorrow. The Provvidenza (much more than a means of transportation or of livelihood-actually a genuine extention of the house by the medlar tree, of the Malavoglia family itself), through its metaphoric counterparts seems to assume an emotional life of its own, capable of many variations, from the restored expectation of a new beginning ("la Provvidenza era scivolata in mare come un'anitra, col becco in aria, e ci sguazzava dentro, si godeva il fresco, dondolandosi mollemente nell'acqua verde, che le colpettava attorno ai fianchi, e il sole le ballava sulla vernice" p. 117), to the exuberance of the good times ("la barca saltava sui marosi come un cefalo in amore" p. 188), to the fragility revealed in the bad ones ("piegata da un lato come un uccello ferito" p. 198; "la Provvidenza tremava come una foglia" p. 200), to the final inanimateness of the useless ("la Provvidenza, che adesso pareva una ciabatta" p. 213). Several metaphoric terms are borrowed from the religious</page><page sequence="11">62 ANTONINO MUSUMECI background of the protagonists-a background which is (as it has been repeatedly pointed out) vaguely cultural before being devotional. This borrowing for a metaphoric purpose reveals precisely such a background. The relationship experiential &gt; religious, by the very nature of the proximity so established, lowers the comparative term to the level of the human by making it its measure. Thus often what is appropriated is the physical characteristic of the religious elements ("grande e grosso quanto il San Cristoforo che c'era dipinto sotto l'arco della pescheria della citta" p. 17; "pareva San Michele Arcangelo in carne ed ossa" p. 25; "bilancie, le quali erano false come Giuda ... hanno un braccio lungo e l'altro corto, come San Francesco" p. 58). Otherwise the intrusion into the human sphere operates as a simple hyperbolic device ("insanguinato come Lazzaro" p. 132; "aspettavano il giorno come il Messia" p. 206; "saltando su come un diavolo" p. 288; "ammanettato come un Cristo" p. 322; "come un'anima del purgatorio" pp. 252, 323 and 344). Thus even religion loses its extraterrestrial dimension and, filtered through a concrete imagination, becomes a descriptive approach to everyday real concerns. The use of metaphoric terms as functional modalities of an hyperbole constitutes a frequent technique in I Malavoglia: "quei poveri Malavoglia i quali piangevano da due giorni come fontane" (p. 62); "ricco come un maiale" (pp. 88 and 267); "si misero a masticare come buoi" (p. 94); " 'Ntoni piangeva come un vitello slattato" (p. 273); "zoppo come il diavolo" (p. 303). The comparative element, by proposing through association an expansion of the original term, establishes a relationship of intensity not with a formal ad hoc grammatical device, but with the accumulation of elements derived from a familiar experiential field. The remote arbitrariness of the superlative is bypassed and replaced by an aggregation with equally plausible objects in re. The resulting relationship is not real:literary, but real:real. The use of metaphoric expressions in I Malavoglia is quite extensive, for things events and persons are typically perceived and defined through metaphoric descriptions. In this process the constant factor is the joining of elements that are always somehow natural to each other, derived immediately from reality and immediately declaring in their affinity the promise of their authenticity. The two terms are always proximate enough to avoid deformation and distant enough to allow an additional penetration</page><page sequence="12">M L N 63 of the element to be evidenced. The variety of the metaphoric terms remains within the limit of the familiar: from the quasi-sacramental bread (pp. 66, 140, 233 and 303), to domestic furnishings ("scopa" pp. 34 and 329; "colabrodo" p. 35; "casseruole vecchie" pp. 103 and 342), to a regional bestiary ("cane" pp. 93, 115, 132, 142, 171, 185, 211,233,277,289,291 and 295; "asino" pp. 187,211,232,235,262, 263 and 265; "lumache" pp. 38 and 241; "buoi" pp. 22, 48, 94, 309 and 345; "gatti" pp. 26-27, 195,197, 207, 281 and 302; "galline" pp. 39, 49, 74, 103, 133, 204, 222, 241, 243, 257 and 316; "mosche" pp. 163, 291 and 311; and the popularly mythical "basilisco" pp. 98, 148 and 284). Images surface from generality into definite forms ("la ragazza cantava come uno stornello" p. 180; "Barbara lo teneva invischiato come un passerotto" p. 182), or allow for the qualifier to suggest a fresher relationship ("le ragazze facevano come uno stormo di passere attorno alla fontana" p. 31; "don Michele il quale sembra un uccellaccio perdigiorno" p. 291). In I Malavoglia metaphors are not superimposed on an existential reality in an impossible effort to capture and to measure it in literary categories, but seem to come from within reality and to partake of its existential anguish. True to the principle of Verismo, the metaphor seems to "essersi fatta da se," to be drawn from the ontological roots of things, where reality subsists in its naked authenticity. Verga's conquest of the metaphor reveals a new proximity to his matter, an acceptance of its challenge, a discovered affinity, a relationship of immediacy-the indicator, on the formal paradigm, of the acquired ability to allow things by way of their hidden resemblances and evocative kinships, to surface and to declare their presence.
