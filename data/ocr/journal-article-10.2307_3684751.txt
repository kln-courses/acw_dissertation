<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sade, or the Philosopher-Villain' PIERRE KLOSSOWSKI Our purpose here shall be to approach Sade's experience as it was conveyed in writing. First we shall try to define the philosophical position he took, or made a pretense of taking, in his novels. The question shall be, What does thinking and writing mean for Sade-as opposed to feeling or acting? Sade himself, so as to definitively disavow authorship of his Justine, declares that all the "philosophical" personages in his "own" works are but "honest people," whereas "by an unpardonable maladroitness which set the author [of Justine] at loggerheads with sages and with madmen," all the "philosophical personages of this novel are afflicted with the gangrene of villainy."2 The confrontation of the philosopher-honest man with the philos- opher-villain goes back to Plato. The philosopher-honest man avails himself of the act of thinking as the sole valid activity of his being. The villain who philosophizes does not grant thought any value other than favoring the activity of the strongest passion-which in the eyes of the honest man is never anything but a lack of being. If the supreme villainy consists of disguising one's passion as thought, the villain for his part never finds in the thought of an honest man anything but the disguise of an impotent passion. To bejust to Sade, we should have to take this "scoundrel philosophy" seriously. Laid out in a work that is immense, it puts a sinister question mark on the decision to think and write-particularly to think of and describe an act instead of committing it. This decision does not resolve the dilemma, how tell of an irreducible depth of sensibility other than by acts that betray it? Such an irreducible depth can never be reflected on or grasped save by acts perpetrated outside of thought-unreflected and ungraspable acts. The Act of Writing in Sade The peculiarly human act of writing presupposes a generality which a singular case claims to join and to understand itself in belonging to this Substance N0 50, 1986 5</page><page sequence="2">6 Pierre Klossowski generality. Sade, in his singular case, conceives of his act of writing to verify such belongingness. The medium of generality in Sade's time is the logically structured language of the classical tradition; in its structure this language reproduces and reconstitutes in the domain of communicative gestures the normative structure of the human race in individuals. This normative structure is physiologically expressed by a subordination of the life-functions, such as those that ensure the conservation and propaga- tion of the race. This need to reproduce and perpetuate oneself in force in each individual corresponds to the need to reproduce and perpetuate oneself by language. Whence the reciprocity of persuasion, which makes possible the exchange of individual singularities in the circuit of general- ity. This reciprocity is brought about only in accordance with the principle of identity or the principle of contradiction, which makes logically struc- tured language one with the general principle of understanding, univer- sal reason. With this principle of the normative generality of the human race in mind, Sade sets out to establish a counter-generality which would obtain for the specificity of perversions, making exchanges between singular cases of perversion possible. These, in the existing normative generality, are defined by the absence of logical structure. Thus is Sade's notion of integral monstrosity conceived. Sade takes this counter-generality, valid for the specificity of perver- sion, to be already implicit in the existing generality. He thinks that the atheism proclaimed by normative reason, in the name of man's freedom and sovereignty, is destined to reverse the existing generality into this counter-generality. Thus atheism, the supreme act of normative reason, has to institute the reign of the total absence of norms. In choosing as a testimony of atheism as an act of reason the perverse way of feeling and acting, devoid of logic, Sade puts universal reason into question; he makes it contradict itself in its application. He puts into question human behavior as it proceeds from the subordination of life- functions. Sade's Critique of Atheism How does reason arrive at atheism? By deciding that the notion of God would still alter in an illogical, hence monstruous, direction its own autonomy. It declares that from the notion of God, which is arbitrary of itself, all arbitrary, perverse, and monstruous behavior derives. If atheism can prevail as a decision of autonomous reason, it is because this auton- omy claims it itself, alone maintains the norms of the species in the individual, and ensures a human comportment in conformity with these norms through the subordination of the life functions in each for the equality and freedom of all. How could it include phenomena contrary to</page><page sequence="3">Sade 7 the conservation of the species and foreign to its own structure without changing its very concept? But Sade does change its concept, by working out, if only implicitly, a critique of normative reason. For Sade this atheism is still nothing but an inverted monotheism, apparently purified of idolatry and hardly distinguishable from deism since, as the deist certifies the notion of God, it guarantees the responsible ego its property and individual identity. For atheism to be purified of this inverted monotheism, it must become integral. In that case what will become of human comportment? One thinks that Sade will answer: See my mon- sters. No doubt he himself shuffled the cards sufficiently for one to suppose him giving so naive an answer. Expressing himself in accordance with the concepts of universal reason, Sade can never account for the positive content of perversion, the polymorphous sensibility, other than with negative concepts that derive from this reason. Thus, while on the diametrically opposite side of the "tonsure-henchmen," he cannot avoid arousing the reprobation of right- thinking atheists, who will never forgive him for having, through the detour of atheism, rejoined the monstrosity of divine arbitrariness. Reason would like to be wholly freed of God. Sade-but in a very under- handed way-wishes to free thought from every preestablished norma- tive reason: integral atheism will be the end of anthropomorphic reason. This obscure will notwithstanding, Sade does not, and does not seek to, distin- guish the act of thinking from the act of referring to universal reason hypostasized in his concept of nature. This distinction is expressed only in the aberrant acts he describes, for here thought has an experimental bearing. Whether through thoughtlessness or out of malicious pleasure taken in contradictory situations, in his novels he gives his personages the aspect of "philosophers afflicted with the gangrene of villainy." If these personages in their machinations dictated by anomaly relate to this normative reason, they do so in a way that lays waste to the autonomy of reason, which they deride and whose vanity they demon- strate when reason, in its supreme act, atheism, claims to guarantee human forms of behavior. If atheism is not reconceived on the basis of phenomena which reason rejects, it will still consolidate the existing institutions based on anthropomorphic norms. One then has this dilem- ma: either reason itself is excluded from its autonomous decision- atheism-which is to forestall monstrosity in man, or else monstrosity is once again excluded from all possible argumentation. Sade's Description of the Sadean Experience The description Sade gives of his own experience in the personages he created covers a twofold experimentation: trying out a representation of the sensible in an aberrant act; trying out a representation in a descrip-</page><page sequence="4">8 Pierre Klossowski tion. Thus we find a relationship between the actualization of the sensible in an act through writing and the effecting of the act independently of its description. With Sade this writing is not purely descriptive (objective) but inter- pretative. In interpreting the aberrant act as a coinciding of sensible nature with reason, Sade humiliates reason with sensible nature and "reason- able" sensible nature with a perverse reason. The perverse reason is nonetheless a rejoinder of the reason that censors sensible nature. As such, perverse reason retains censorship and introduces into "reason- able" sensory order punitive sanction as an outrage-which Sade under- stands to be the transgression of norms. For Sade the fact of feeling, the irreducible element in perversion, does not have to bejustified. It is the aberrant act that issues from sensible nature that Sade wishes to moralize--aberrant in the eyes of Sade himself inasmuch as reason, even atheist reason, cannot recognize itself in it. Sensory nature is, in Sade, describable only in the form of a propensity to act. From its description Sade passes progressively to the moral ex- planation of the act. He thus establishes between the perverse way of feeling and the perverse way of acting a twofold relationship which the expression of one's own inwardness maintains with, on the one hand, the exteriority of the aberrant act and, on the other hand, with the exteriority of normative reason. Then the distinction between deliberate sadism and an unreflecting sadistic act can be made only via the intermediary of normative reason. The result is an indissoluble whole in which the sensory (that is, the experience peculiar to Sade) is obscured in the measure that discourse has to justify the act. Because of his way of conceiving the act which proceeds from a perverse way of feeling, Sade declares himself an atheist. Conceiving of a perverse act as obedient to a moral imperative, to an idea, he forms a new conception of perverse sensibility. Sade explicitly reorganizes the insub- ordination of the life-functions on the basis of atheist reason, and implic- itly disorganizes normative reason on the basis of this functional insub- ordination. Why Sade did not Seek for a Positive Conceptual Formulation of Perversion (that is, of Sensible Polymorphy). The Necessity for Outrage. If Sade had sought (given that he would have ever been concerned with such a thing) a positive conceptual formulation of perversion, he would have passed alongside of the enigma he sets up; he would have intellectualized the phenomenon of sadism properly so-called. The motive for this is more obscure and forms the nodus of the sadean experience. This motive is outrage, where what is outraged is maintained to serve as a support for transgression. Sade shuts himself up in the sphere of normative reason, not only</page><page sequence="5">Sade 9 because he remains dependent on logically structured language, but because the constraint exercised by the existing institutions comes to be individuated in his own fatality. If one abstracts from the close connivance of depressive forces with those that are subversive-a connivance established in consciousness be- cause reason is constrained to serve as a reference for anomaly, and anomaly is made to refer to reason via the detour of atheism-one takes away from transgression the necessity for outrage. Outrage becomes a purely intel- lectual transgression that is one with the general insurrection of minds on the eve of the Revolution. Sadism itself would then be but one utopian ideology among others. On the other hand, the necessity inherent in the phenomenon requires that in Sade the transgression prevail over the postulates which derive logically from his atheist declarations. The Theme of Transgression Makes the Sadist Postulates of Integral Atheism Contradictory Integral atheism means that the principle of identity itself disappears along with the absolute guarantor of this principle; thus the property of having a responsible self is morally and physically abolished. The first consequence is the universal prostitution of beings. This is but the coun- terpart of integral monstrosity, which rests on the insubordination of life-functions, in the absence of the normative authority of the species. Now the need for transgression comes to oppose in a paradoxical way this twofold consequence of atheism. For the expropriation of the corporeal and moral ego antecedent to universal prostitution is still some- thing that could be instituted-in the utopian sense of Fourier's phalan- stery, based on the "interplay of the passions." As soon as this pooling- together of passions is instituted, there would no longer be the tension necessary for outrage, and sadism would dissipate-unless one knowingly created rules to be broken, this being the "game" (as is indeed done in the secret societies imagined by Sade). Transgression presupposes the existing order, the apparent mainte- nance of norms, for the benefit of an accumulation of energy which makes transgression necessary. Thus universal prostitution has meaning only in the function of the moral possession of an individual body. Without this notion of ownership prostitution would lose its attraction and outrage would beat the empty air--unless in the state of institutional- ized prostitution the outrage would consist of inflicting the intrinsic ownership of a body on a given individual who has been excluded from the universal pooling-together. Likewise for integral monstrosity as counter-generality implicit in the existing generality, perversion (the insubordination of the life-functions) derives its transgressive value in the acts it inspires (particularly the sodomist act) only from the permanence of norms (such as the normative</page><page sequence="6">10 Pierre Klossowski differentiation of the sexes). In the measure that perversion is more or less latent in individuals, it serves only as a model proposed to "normal" individuals as a way of transgression,just as one pervert finding a kindred spirit in another makes a mutual surpassing of the determinate case of each possible. If the human race as a whole "degenerated," if there were no longer anyone but avowed perverts-if integral monstrosity were thus to become effective-one could think that Sade's "goal" would have been reached- that there would no longer be any "monsters" and "sadism" would dis- appear. This perspective is precisely the snare of an "optimist" interpreta- tion of Sade, which conjures away the enigma of his work in a desire to credit its "psychopathological"-and therefore therapeutic-"value." But the ruse in the phenomenon which composes the physiognomy Sade envisages lies in pretending to have a "goal," however "scientific" it be. This ruse resides in the underlying intuition that integral monstrosity can only be realized within the conditions that made sadism possible, within a space that is composed of obstacles, in the logically structured language of norms and institutions. The absence of logical structure can be verified only through the given logic, even when it would be the false logic which by refusing monstrosity provokes it. In turn monstrosity or anomaly, according to Sade, brings out the given norms and only affirms itself negatively. It is not surprising, then, that in Sade's descriptions the norms, the existing institutions, structure the very form of perversions. Nor is it surprising that Sade made no effort to formulate the positive content of perversion with new concepts. It is not the concept of nature in Sade, a concept originating in Spinoza and which Sade takes as "nature destruc- tive of its own works," that will explain the phenomenon of transgression. For, he says, nature destroys because "it aspires to regain its own most active power." This concept only serves as an argument for murder, for the vanity of murder, as well as for refuting the law of the propagation of the race. It does not elucidate the transgressive enjoyment, which aspires at nothing save to renew itself. Transgression (outrage) seems absurd and puerile where it does not succeed in resolving itself into a state of affairs where it would no longer be necessary. But it belongs to the nature of transgression that it never be able to find such a state. Transgression is then something other than the pure explosion of energy accumulated by means of an obstacle. Trans- gression is an incessant recuperation of the possible itself-where the existing state of affairs has eliminated that possible from another form of existence. The possible in what does not exist can never be anything but possible; for if the act were to recuperate this possible as a new form of existence, it would have to transgress it in turn. The possible then elimi- nated would have to be recuperated yet again. What the act of transgres- sion recuperates from the possible in what does not exist is its own possibility of transgressing what exists. Transgression remains a necessity in Sade's experience independent</page><page sequence="7">Sade 11 of the interpretation he gives of it. It is not only because it is given as a testimony of atheism that transgression must not and never can find a state in which it could be resolved; the energy must constantly be sur- passed in order to verify its level. It falls below the level reached as soon as it no longer meets an obstacle. A transgression must engender another transgression. But if it is thus reiterated, in Sade it reiterates itself in principle only through one same act. This very act can never be transgressed; its image is each time represented as though it had never been carried out. Critique of the Pervert in Sade, Prior to the Creation of the Sadean Personage To arrive at his notion of integral monstrosity, and to create in an original way the personage-type to represent it, Sade first had to under- take a critique of the pervert properly so-called. The term perversion in the pathological sense does not exist in Sade. His terminology in this domain remains that of moral psychology--of the examination of conscience developed by the casuists. In the 120 Days of Sodom the different cases of perversion are desig- nated as passions, advancing from the simple to the complicated passions. The whole set forms that genealogical tree of vices and crimes already evoked in Aline and Valcour. The subject affected with perversity is termed vicious, depraved, a "lecherous criminal," indulging in "murders out of debauchery." However, one term recurs which is closest to the notions of modern pathology-the term maniac. Indeed, the pervert Sade observes and describes in the 120 Days-that is, in the narration of anecdotes about and episodes in brothels which provides themes on which the four prin- cipal personages vary and improvise-behaves essentially as a maniac. He subordinates his enjoyment to effecting one sole gesture. The pervert is distinguished in the midst of ordinary licencious com- pany by a determinate fixed idea. This is not yet the idea in the sense Sade later works out. In the context of what one now names "libertinage," nothing is less free than the pervert's gesture. For if one means by libertinage the pure and simple propensity to orgy, as free of scrupules as can be, the desire of a pervert is never sated other than by the scrupulous taste for, the scrupulous search for, a detail, a gesture, proceeding scrupulously to this detail. Such a concern escapes those who deliver themselves over to outbursts of frustrated appetites. The pervert pursues the execution of one sole gesture; it is a matter of an instant. The existence of the pervert becomes the perpetual waiting for the instant in which this gesture can be performed. The pervert as such can signify himself only by this gesture; executing this gesture counts for the totality of existing. Because of this the pervert has nothing to say about his gesture that would be intelligible on the level of reciprocity between individuals. The pervert is both below and beyond the level of "individuals," which constitutes a set of functions subordinated</page><page sequence="8">12 Pierre Klossowski according to the norms of the species. He presents an arbitrary sub- ordination of the habitual life-functions to one sole insubordinate func- tion-a craving for an improper object. In this regard he is not yet at the level of individuals. But inasmuch as this insubordination of one sole function can only be concretized and thus succeed in individuating itself in his case, he suggests to Sade's reflection a multiple possibility of redis- tribution of functions. In this sense, beyond individuals "normally" con- stituted, the pervert opens the vaster perspective of sensible polymorphy. Except that, in the conditions of life for the human race, he can affirm himself only by destroying these conditions in himself-thefact of existing consecrates the death of the species in him as an individual. Being is verified as a suspension of life itself. Perversion would thus correspond to a property of being founded on the expropriation of life-functions. An expropriation of one's own body and that of others would then be the meaning of this property of being. Whatever the sort of perversion affecting him, the pervert by his gesture seems to formulate a definition of existence and a sort of judg- ment borne on existence. For this gesture to verify in this way the fact of existing, it must correspond to a representation. What the gesture desig- nates is not comprehensible in itself. Though produced in a sphere of licence, the pervert's gesture can be understood only as diverted from its incomprehensible content. One never discerns anything in this gesture but a detoured way of sating an appetite, which apparently finds the same solution as "normal" appetites. In Sade's eyes the perverse gesture must have a signification that becomes obscured in the closed circuit of a determinate case of perver- sion. Perverse gesticulation is a deaf-mute language. Deaf-mutes possess a memory of their code, but the pervert's gesture does not yet belong to any code. His own perversity is its own memory; it is not so much the pervert that recalls his gesture so as to recommence it as it is the gesture itself that recalls the pervert. If it signifies something intelligible, if it answers to a representation, if finally it is a judgment, this gesture interprets something. To make it explicit, Sade will interpret the supposed interpretation of the pervert. He will do so on the basis of what he deciphers in the pervert's gesture. A quite central case of perversity, which Sade will take as the basis to interpret all the others, the principle of affinity in what will form integral monstrosity, is that of sodomy. This biblical term, consecrated by moral theology, covers an action which is not limited to homosexual practice. Homosexuality, which is not an intrinsic perversion, must be distin- guished from sodomy, which is. Homosexual behaviors, like heterosexual behaviors, admit of giving rise to an institution, as was visible many times in the history of human societies. But sodomy is formulated by a specific gesture of counter-generality, which is most significant in Sade's eyes- that which strikes precisely at the law of the propagation of the species and thus bears witness to the death of the species in an individual. It evinces not</page><page sequence="9">Sade 13 only an attitude of refusal but of aggression; while being the simulacrum of the act of generation, it is the mockery of it. In this sense it is also a simulacrum of the destruction that a subject dreams of ravaging on another of the same sex by a sort of mutual trangression of their limits. Perpetrated on a subject of the same sex, it is a simulacrum of metamorphosis and is always accompanied by a sort of magic fascination. Indeed, in- asmuch as it transgresses the organic specificity of individuals, this ges- ture introduces into existence the principle of the metamorphosis of beings into one another, which integral monstrosity tends to reproduce and which universal prostitution, the ultimate application of atheism, postulates. To decipher the pervert's gesture Sade sets up a code of perversion. The key sign is revealed by its own constitution, the sign of the sodomite gesture. For Sade all things, close-up or far-off, gravitate around this gesture-the most absolute for what is lethal for the norms of the species, somehow immortal by virtue of its recommencing, the most ambiguous in that it is conceivable only by the existence of these norms, the most qualified for the transgression that can be brought about only through the obstacle constituted by these norms. One can see that Sade in no way seeks to know the origin of perversion with respect to norms, nor to explain how these norms could be depraved in the individual. He takes perversion as a given (constitutional or con- genital) phenomenon which, like everything that nature manifests, can be explained rationally. Here Sade introduces logically structured language into perversion which is, with respect to this language, a structure apparently devoid of logic. This code, translated into words, will feel the effects of the perverse gesture on which it will be structured; logical language will restructure the perverse gesture and mark Sade's written expression of it. What logical language, as the language of reason, will adapt to the coded gesture of the pervert is atheism-as an "act of good sense," of "common sense." On the other hand, the perverse gesture this code introduces into the language of "common sense" is the nonlanguage of monstruousness, which subsists under this code. Here between the rational language of the norms and anomaly there is a sort of osmosis which Sade alone could carry off- atheism becomes integral only inasmuch as perversion trys to be reason- able, and only inasmuch as perversion trys to be reasonable will it become integral monstrosity. Then Sade inaugurates his original creation by a decisive master- stroke: to create the type of the pervert he projects, Sade at last takes him out of conventional licencious society and, in particular, out of the brothel. Here Sade breaks with the libertine literary tradition and intro- duces the theme of perversion into the depiction of manners. Sade camps his personage in the everyday world; that is, he finds him in the midst of institutions, in the fortuitousness of social life. In this way the world itself appears as the locus in which the secret law of the universal prostitution of</page><page sequence="10">14 Pierre Klossowski beings is verified. In this way Sade conceives counter-generality to be already implicit in the existent generality, not in order to criticize institu- tions, but to demonstrate that of themselves they ensure the triumph of the perversions. Sade invents a type of pervert who speaks with his singular gesture in the name of generality. If this gesture counts as ajudgment, it is pronounced only at the moment that the notion of generality intervenes. If the gesture is singular, indecipherable, it is so only relative to a generality of gestures. The generality of gestures is one with speech. If his own gesture has a meaning for the pervert, he has no need of speech to express what it signifies by itself. But the singular gesture of the pervert is precisely not the gesture which, in generality, sometimes accompanies speech, some- times is substituted for the word, and sometimes even contradicts it. The singular gesture of the pervert empties all content out ofspeech at once since it is by itself the whole fact of existing. But the pervert explicates his singular gesture in accordance with the generality of gestures once he becomes the personage-type of Sade. By the very fact that he speaks he requires the reciprocity involved in persua- sion and invokes his belongingness to the human race. It follows that at the moment of speech the singularity of the gesture which was the motive of discourse is disavowed because such singularity would be proper to each one. The content of his gesture is then not singular, for in silence it still had no meaning, which it now acquires in speech. If, as he says, the singularity of his gesture is proper to each, the pervert still has to show that each one can act in the singular way that he acts. Yet he speaks that way only because he is convinced of the contrary- that he is alone to act in this way. From the very fact that he speaks, he is mistaken about the object of his demonstration and raises up the obstacle installed in himself. For the pervert that speaks the obstacle is not to be singular but to belong to generality in his own singularity. How can he overcome this obstacle? If he speaks, can he show in the name of generality that there is no generality and that the norms of the species have no real existence? If that were true, one could no longer say that this singularity is proper to each. How could one show that norms do not exist? The singularity of the gesture is reestablished without its opaqueness being in any way cleared up. The pervert, the only one having to show the validity of his gesture, makes haste to execute it. The discourse of the pervert, due to the very fact that he invokes the adherence of common sense, remains a sophism in that one does not get away from the concept of normative reason. Persuasion can be brought about only if the interlocutor in his turn is led to reject norms in himself. It is not by arguments that Sade's personage can obtain the assent of the interlocutor, but by complicity. Complicity is the contrary of persuasion in accordance with universal understanding. Those who know themselves to be accomplices in aberra- tion need no argument to understand one another. Yet Sade's person-</page><page sequence="11">Sade 15 ages, despite the affinities they discover in one another through the unique gesture (of sodomy), owe it to themselves to proclaim each time the absence of a god guarantor of norms-to profess the integral atheism which they claim to bear witness to by their acts. But among themselves, the coded gesture is disengaged from the logically structured language which, as an oratorical precaution, covers it, and the key sign that this gesture represents reappears in its true locus: the secret society. Here the gesture becomes a simulacrum, a rite which the members of the secret society do not explain to one another other than by the inexistence of the absolute guarantor of norms-an inexistence they commemorate as an event that one can represent only by this gesture. For complicity with the pervert to be able to emerge even in the normal interlocutor, he qua "reasonable" individual must first be disinte- grated. This is possible only by a leap of impulse or repulsion which the word of the pervert provokes in him. How could the pervert recognize complicity in this "normal" inter- locutor? By the very gesture which, in the generality of gestures, a subject makes in contradiction to what he says. The interlocutor who rejects the sophism of the pervert makes a gesture which is, in this sense, contradic- tory, for, notwithstanding the denial it expresses, physically, hence cor- poreally, it bears witness to his own singularity-latent in him as in each one. If the rejection of the sophism is made in the name of the generality of common sense, what is the interlocutor, who at this moment has become a passive subject, refusing, if not this latent singularity? He can make this gesture of negation and defense only by avowing his own singularity. The pervert lays in wait for this contradictory gesture, this reflex gesture, this corporeal, thus mute, gesture, which he deciphers in these terms: "Consider all the fatalities which unite us and see if nature does not offer you a victim in my individual nature." How Integral Monstrosity Constitutes a Space for Minds: The Asceticism of Apathy For Sade the sodomist act is the supreme form of the transgression of norms (which supposes their paradoxical maintenance); at the same time it must be the way to transgress the different cases of perversion and thus constitute the principle of affinity of the perversions for one another. Like a Kallitype test, this act suppresses the specific frontiers between the sexes and, according to Sade, constitutes the key sign for all perversions. Having interpreted this act morally as a testimony of atheism and a declaration of war on the norms inherited from monotheism, Sade then projects perversion into the domain of thought. There integral monstros- ity forms a sort of space for minds that communicate with one another by mutual understanding of this key sign. Whence the doctrinal character of Sade's work and of the didactic situations he lays out; whence, above all,</page><page sequence="12">16 Pierre Klossowski the preliminary discrimination which is in effect in this singular academy-according to which the doctors of monstrosity recognize one another, distinguish themselves from the pervert shut up in his isolated case, and choose their disciples. No candidate for integral monstrosity is recognized to be qualified who has not conceived his way of acting as a profession of atheism; no atheist is recognized who is not capable of passing immediately into action. Once such disciples are chosen, they are subjected to a progressive initiation which builds up in the practice of an asceticism-the asceticism of apathy. As Sade suggests, the practice of apathy supposes that what one names "soul," "consciousness," "sensibility," and "the heart" are only diverse structures which affect the concentration of the same impulsive forces. They can elaborate the structure of an instrument of intimidation under the pressure of the institutional world, or that of an instrument of subver- sion under the internal pressure of these forces-and always do so in an instantaneous movement. But it is always the same impulses that intimi- date us at the same time they raise us up in revolt. How does this intimidating insurrection, or this insurrectional in- timidation, act in us? By the images that preceed the acts, arousing us to act or to undergo them, as well as by the images of acts committed or omitted which recur in us and make up remorseful conscience whenever the idleness of the impulses reconstitutes it. Thus consciousness of oneself and others is a most fragile and most transparent structure. Since our impulses intimidate us in the form of "fear," "compassion," "horror," or "remorse," by images of acts that have been or can be realized, we have to substitute any acts whatever for these disheartening images whenever they tend to substitute themselves for the acts and thus to forestall them. Sade does not use the term "image" here; we put this term in place of the terms "fear" and "remorse" which presuppose a representation of the act that has been or has to be committed. Yet an image intervenes, not only in the form of remorse, but also in the form of a project. Reiteration is the condition required for the monster to remain on the level of monstrosity; if, however, reiteration is purely passionate it re- mains ill-ensured. To progress beyond the level that has been arrived at, the monster has to first avoid falling back; he can do so only if he reiterates his acts in absolute apathy. This alone can maintain him in a state of permanent transgression. In putting this new condition on the candidate for integral monstrosity, Sade introduces a critique of the sensory and, especially, the primary benefits of transgression: the enjoyment insepa- rable from the act. How can the same act committed in intoxication, that is, delirium, be reiterated deliberately? For there to be any possibility of reeffecting this act, must not the image which re-presents itself to the mind, however disheartening it be, function as a lure, a promise of enjoyment?</page><page sequence="13">Sade 17 We can reconstitute what Sade understands by his maxim of the apathic reiteration of an act as follows: admitted that Sade recognizes here the alternation of the diverse structures which the impulsive forces take on in their insurrectional and also intimidating movement. He seems to have also recognized a self-consciousness in one of these structures which these forces, individuated in the subject, developed under the pressure of the institutional environment of norms. This structure undergoes varia- tions and suffers instability, though this becomes clear only after the event. Sometimes these forces put the subject outside of himself and make him act against himself; they thus transgress the structure of consciousness and decompose it. Sometimes, in particular when they make him act against himself, they recompose the (remembering) consciousness of the subject by means of his inaction; in this case, these same forces are inverted. This inversion constitutes a consciousness that censures the subject. Cen- sorship is exercised because being put outside of oneself is felt as a threat by the subject inasmuch as that subject is dependent on the norms of the species. This censorship is already experienced in the very act of transgression, and is the necessary motive for it. For Sade moral conscience simply corresponds to an exhaustion of impulsive forces (the "calm of the senses"), which opens that interval in which the disheartening image of the act committed re-presents itself in the form of "remorse." In fact, because its image was disheartening the first time the act was committed, it presents itself as a promise of enjoyment. If now the reiteration of the same act is to "annihilate" conscience, it does so because each time the same forces through inversion also reestablish conscience. Inverted into censorship, they provoke the act anew. The topic of apathetic reiteration here expresses an underlying apprehension-Sade feels quite clearly that transgression is bound up with censorship, but the purely logical analysis which the formulation of what he feels presupposes does not grasp its contradictory simultaneity. He describes and decomposes it into successive states: insurrection, trans- gression, and intimidation. But intimidation and transgression remain in close interdependency, provoking one another. This is why Sade wishes to eliminate intimidation by apathetic reiteration of the act. He then apparently empties transgression of the benefit it would give-enjoy- ment. Elimination of the sensory element works, at the same time, to forestall the return of moral conscience. But in forestalling its return, this asceti- cism seems to uproot the motive for transgression. The act (the sodomite act which forms the key sign of all perversion) has no significative value save as a conscious transgression of the norms represented by conscious- ness. The sought-for being cast outside of oneself is, in practice, equivalent to a disintegration of the consciousness of the subject by thought. Thought must reestablish the primitive version of the impulsive forces which the consciousness of the subject inverted. For the disciple who will practice the doctrine (not the pervert shut up in his own singular case), monstros-</page><page sequence="14">18 Pierre Klossowski ity is the zone of being outside of oneself, outside of consciousness, in which the monster will be able to maintain himself only by the reiteration of the same act. The "voluptuous harshness" which, according to Sade, is its fruit, is no longer of the sensory order: "harshness" presupposes a distinc- tion between thought and moral conscience; "voluptuous" alludes to the ecstasy of thought in the representation of the act reiterated "in cold blood"-an ecstasy here opposed to its functional analogue, orgasm. The orgastic instant amounts to a fall of thought outside of its own ecstasy. It is this fall outside of ecstasy which occurs in the functional orgasm that Sade's personage wishes to forestall through apathy. He knows that orgasm is but a tribute paid to the norms of the species and thus a counterfeit of the ecstasy of thought. It is not enough that orgasm in the sodomist act would be but a loss of forces, a useless enjoyment. But this useless enjoyment is made one with the ecstasy of thought when the act, this time separated from orgasm, is reiterated. The apathetic reiteration of the act brings to light a new factor- number, more particularly, the relationship between quantity and quality in sadism. The act passionately reiterated on the same object is depreciated (or diversified) for the benefit of the quality of the object. Insofar as the object is multiplied and the number of objects depreciates them, the quality of the act itself, reiterated in apathy, is better affirmed. The Lesson of Apathy: Is the Transgression of the Act Possible? It could be that for thought apathetic reiteration is but a parable and that transgression ends by transgressing the act: "Out of virtue you will no longer conceive repentance, for you will have acquired the habit of doing evil as soon as virtue shows itself, and so as to no longer do evilyou will prevent virtue from ever appearing.... " Let us see if this second maxim contradicts or corroborates the maxim of apathetic reiteration. For this we must consider both: "You will have acquired the habit of doing evil ... " and "so as to no longer do evil." Here there are two ways of acting such that the first substitutes itself for the second, to constitute virtue itself in nonrepentance, for it will now lie in "no longer doing evil." The coordinate proposition introduced by for (qua re) incriminates as a motive for repentance the habit of doing evil as soon as virtue shows itself. Hence there is a connection between two sorts of reaction: repentance, which is but a reaction undergone by the subject, and the habit of doing evil upon sight of virtue, a habit which is a reflex, reacting immediately with an outrage. Our first conclusion is that repentance and the habit of doing evil are equally negative reflexes. If that is the case, the second maxim (prevent- ing virtue from appearing) wishes to substitute for the reflex of outrage a reaction to this reflex (therefore to the necessity of outrage), which would then be a positive acting.</page><page sequence="15">Sade 19 "You will have acquired the habit of doing evil ... "-is this not the subject of the apathetic reiteration when it is deliberate? When then is it no longer a habit of doing evil? If it is a transposition, thus a deliberate reflex, how can it be distinguished from the habit of doing evil, of perpetrating an outrage? Were it not so distinguishable, the second maxim would seem but a refutation of apathetic reiteration. For the second maxim to be, on the contrary, its explanation, one has to see how it disengages from the simple reacting characteristic of outrage a positive acting without outrage-by preventing virtue from "appearing." How does virtue show itself-in what intolerable aspect? In consistency of the conscious subject which represents Good. According to the principle of identity which follows from individuation, inconsistency is Evil. But for the impulsive forces that bear ill will against individuation, inconsistency is Good. Hence, since the impulsive forces maintain inconsistency but manifest themselves only in function of consistency, which is intolerable to them, they must acquire constancy in inconsistency. In a word, Sade wished to transgress the act of outrage by a permanent state of perpetual move- ment-that movement which Nietzsche much later named the innocence of becoming. But Sade caught sight of this transgression of transgression by itself only for a moment; the hyperbole of his thought brings him back to the core of irreducible sensibility bound to its representation of the outrageous act, which excludes the very notion of innocence. That is why impulsive forces can prevent virtue from appearing, prevent consistency from showing itself, only through the constancy of an act. Its reiteration, however apathetic it be, is but a reiterated reconstitution of the intolerable aspect of virtue as well as of the outrage this aspect provokes. Androgyny in Sade's Representation In Sade the principle types of perversion are generally represented by men, and unnatural women do not really figure in his representation as an anomaly. Man, because traditionally he alone exercises reflection, represents the rational sex; he is therefore also alone invoked to account for unreason. However monstruous, perverse, or delirious a woman may be, she is never considered "abnormal," for it is written in the norms that by nature she is without reflection, possesses no equilibrium or measure, and that she never represents anything but uncontrolled sensory nature, more or less attenuated by a reflection prescribed by man. Indeed, the more monstruous or mad she is, the more fully a woman she is-according to the traditional representation, which was always tainted with misogyny. Yet she has resources that man will never possess, resources which the pervert shares with her. The integral monstrosity of Sade's project has as its immediate effect an exchange of the specific qualities of the sexes. A simple symmetrical</page><page sequence="16">20 Pierre Klossowski reversal of the schema of differentiation within each of the two sexes will result-giving active and passive pederasty on the one side, lesbianism and tribadism on the other. In integral monstrosity as a didactic project for sensory polymor- phousness, the two representatives of the species, male and female, will, in their relationship with one another, face a twofold model. Each of the two sexes interiorizes the model by virtue of the ambivalence proper to each, then each embellishes the ambivalence. Then, although man as the sadean pervert-type apparently retains rational primacy, he presents himself as an expression of sensory nature, but in the sense that the sensory presents itself to him in a perspective of the mind-the perspective of the imaginary. Perversion, we said at the beginning, insofar as it confirms the fact of being by a suspension of life-functions, would correspond to a property of being whose meaning would be the expropriation of one's own body and of the body of the other. Integral atheism, the suppression of an absolute guarantor of the norms, would ideologically corroborate this expropriation. For in abol- ishing the limits of the responsible and self-identical ego, it logically abolished the identity of one's own body. In itself the body is the concrete product of the individuation of the impulsive forces realized according to the norms of the species. Since we are in fact dealing with denomination in language, we can say now that these impulsive forces speak in the pervert in these terms: the language of institutions has taken over this body, more particularly taken over what is functional in "my" body, for the best conservation of the species. This language has assimilated the body which "I am" through this body to the point that "we" have been expropriated by the institutions from the beginning. This body has been restored to "me" corrected in certain ways: certain forces have been pruned away, others subjugated by language. Then "I" do not possess "my" body save in the name of the institutions of which the language in "me" is just the keeper. The institutional language has taught "me" that this body in which "I am" was "mine." The greatest crime "I" can commit is not so much to take away "his" body from the "other" as it is to break this "myself" instituted by language from "my" body. What "I" gain, "myself" having a body, "I" immediately lose in reciprocal relations with the "other" whose body does not belong to "me." The representation of having a body whose state is not that of one's own body is clearly specific to perversion. Although the pervert feels the alterity of the alien body, he feels much more the body of the other as being his own, and the body that normatively and institutionally is his he experi- ences as being really foreign to himself, that is, foreign to the insubordinate function that defines him. For him to be able to conceive the effect of his violence on the other, he must first inhabit the other. In the reflexes of another's body he verifies foreignness-the irruption of an alien force within "himself." He is both within and without.</page><page sequence="17">Sade 21 How can this be brought about? Not first, indeed not at all, by recourse to violence that could go as far as murder, but by imagination that preceeds every violent act-by the primacy of the imaginary over the rational. This primacy of the imaginary lies in the representation of enjoyment, where one sees the impulse doubling up in the projection of an image of itself. Here enjoyment extends to organs excluded from the function of propagation, and the functional organs are reduced to idle- ness for the purposes of useless enjoyment. The imagination, preceeding the perverse gesture, is thus constituted on correspondencies of intensity which the functional reason had to exclude in order to set itself up on the basis of the subordination of the life-functions of the species. While reason (logical language) expresses and also guarantees the equilibrium which the species found in its empiri- cal habits, imagination apprehends the schemas of an illusory function. The existing organ takes the place of the absent, hence ideal, "functional" structure in these schemas. It will be clear that in these schemas the absence of the imagined structure is a factor of excitation; the existing structure offers a terrain where outrage is inflicted in the name of what is absent-the ideal structure of the androgyne. If the presence of this imaginary structure in the pervert and the breaking with his body are strong to the point that he could comport himself as a woman with his masculine counterpart and feel feminine passivity in himself, he can comport himself actively only if he deals with his masculine counterpart as with a woman, or deals with a woman as with a boy. From this latter case, Sade elaborates the synthetic simulacrum of the androgyne-not a man-woman, but a woman-man. Juliette was conceived in these terms. The sadean heroin is the contrary of a man, more particu- larly the contrary of the sadean pervert who, in integral monstrosity, defines sensory nature; she sets forth reason. As she makes use of reason to recover possession of sensory nature, which she is originally and traditional according to the norms, she recovers it only inasmuch as she progresses into insensibility; she offers the perfect example of the moral- ity of apathy. This morality is one of the hidden resources of women. Copied from feminine frigidity, here set up as a doctrine, this morality is the methodic application of frigidity. Finally, and most importantly, it is the sadean heroin who carries atheism all the way to its integral affirma- tion, dissociating it from normative and anthropomorphic reason, freeing thought itself in the experimental order of monstrosity. The abolition of norms, which this thought implies, is more important to the woman than to the pervert, in whom the norms exist only in a ruined state. Qua woman she remains at least organically subject to the norms, especially by reason of her fecundable state. She will then the more seek in apathy her line of conduct; its first effect is the extirpation of all maternal instinct. Here again the fact that the norms themselves (here corporeal norms) as institutions structure the forces that are to destroy</page><page sequence="18">22 Pierre Klossowski them is verified. "Normally" prostitutable, "normally" vicious, "normally" lesbian and tribade, it is again reason, "good sense," that dictates to her that she be all this deliberately. Inasmuch as she learns to undergo in cold blood the perverse acts committed on her own body, she develops viril energy as a consummate Callipygian. Thus Juliette offers herself to the sadean pervert as the simulacrum of what the sodomite act designates. In this figure, formed by the reversal of sensory passivity into active intellection, the supreme act of transgression finds its complementary image. How the Sadist Experience Renders Unreadable the Conventional Form of Communication In what has preceeded I sought to examine the interpretative character of the description Sade gives of his own experience. This experience appeared to include a twofold experimentation: trying out a representa- tion of sensory nature in an aberrant act and trying out a representation in its description. We must return to the fact that Sade writes a work-what is its literary character? How does its singularity distinguish it not only from its contemporary literary context, but from everything defined as literature? Is it essentially modern, or does it also escape this definition? We can narrow the question to the terms formulated above: How does the sensory nature in an aberrant act get actualized by writing, and what is the relationship of this actualization with the perpetration of the act independently of its description? Dealing with a personal experience condemned by its very nature to remain incommunicable, Sade chooses to translate this in the conven- tional form of all communication. Conventional communication becomes "unreadable" each time the incommunicable experience is affirmed, but becomes more readable when the same experience disappears again. How then does Sade's experience render his conventional form of communica- tion "unreadable"? Because it is entirely founded on reiteration. The object of reiteration is to arouse an ecstasy. This ecstasy cannot be ren- dered by language; what language describes are the ways, the dispositions that prepare for it. But it does not follow that the ecstasy and the reitera- tion are the same thing. In description the facts of reiterating and under- going ecstasy are two aspects. For the reader there remains only the reiteration described and the wholly exterior aspect of the ecstasy, the orgasm described, which is counterfeit ecstasy. Sade seems to represent his reader as someone he must continually keep gasping with the promise of a new vertigo. Yet what the reader is in the end seeking at the expense of his reading is a sort of lapse of attention at a moment when the whole text wants sustained attention, a lapse of the thought pursued so laboriously. Here we cannot avoid comparing the fact</page><page sequence="19">Sade 23 of writing with the principle of apathetic reiteration of acts. This principle immediately affects Sade's literary expression, concerning what that liter- ary expression contains that is apparently nonliterary, unreadable in the broad sense of the term. Apathetic reiteration conveys Sade's own strug- gle to regain possession of what is irreducible in his experience. It defines the bottom of this experience; actualization of aberrant acts by writing corresponds to the apathetic reiteration of this act when perpetrated independently of its description. Actualizing the act, writing works up the ecstasy of thought; reiterated on the level of language, ecstasy coincides with reiterated transgression by fictitious personages, in the sense that the logically structured language with which Sade expresses himself becomes for him the terrain of outrage, just as it is the terrain of norms. If Sade expresses himself in this language, it is because this language has also structured in advance the depth of Sade's own experience. In order to account for it to himself in writing, he could apprehend it only in accordance with the laws of this language-by transgressing them. He never reproduces these laws in their trangression in any other way. Is it then the logical structure of language that wills the reiteration of outrage, or is it the very core of the experience that does so? No doubt it is this core of experience, already structured by language, but restructuring its logic on the basis of the aberrant act. Traditional language, which Sade himself uses with prestigious effect, can suffer everything that is conformed with its logical structure. It undertakes to correct, censor, exclude, or silence everything that would destroy this structure-all non-sense. To describe aberration is to positively set forth the absence of elements which make a thing, a state, a being not viable. Yet it is this logical structure that Sade accepts and conserves without discussion; what is more, he develops it, systematizes it, to the point of outraging it. Sade outrages logical structure by conserving it only as a dimension of aberration-not because aberration is described in it but because the aberrant act is reproduced in it. To thus reproduce the aberrant act amounts to giving language out as a possibility of action; whence the irruption of non-language in language. When Suetonius describes Caligula's or Nero's aberrant acts, it is not to maintain beyond these men the possibility of these acts in his text, nor is it to identify his text with the maintenance of this possibility. Sade's text maintains and supports the possibility of the aberrant act inasmuch as writing actualizes it. Yet this actualization by writing acts as a censorship which Sade inflicts on himself with regard to an act that could be perpe- trated independently of its description. The image of the aberrant act has first become a logically structured aberration. Thus structured in dis- course, the aberration exhausts reflection; the words become again what the discourse had for a moment prevented them from being: a propensity to the very act that reestablishes the image of its perpetration in its muteness. Why in its muteness? Because the motive of the act to be done,</page><page sequence="20">24 Pierre Klossowski the outrage, is not recognized in this sort of monumentalization of the possibility for action by speech, words, or the phrasing of discourse. The discourse buried the act that was to be committed while it exalted its image. The propensity to the aberrant act then destroys this funerary image and once again requires obedience to its motive. Thus it precipi- tates anew the description of the act that here stands for its real execution, but can do so only as recommenced. The parallelism between the apathetic reiteration of acts and Sade's descriptive reiteration again confirms that the image of the act to be done is re-presented each time not only as though it had never been performed, but also never described. This reversibility in one process inscribes the presence of non-language in language; it is a foreclosure of language by language. "Foreclosure" means that something remains outside. That which remains outside is, once again, the act to be done. The less it is perpetrated the more it strikes on the door-the door of literary vacuity. The blows struck on the door are Sade's words, which, if they now reverberate within literature, remain nonetheless blows struck from without. The outside is what of itself dispenses with any commentary. What gives Sade's text its disturbing originality is that through him this outside comes to be com- mented on as something produced within thought. Do we read Sade as we read Laclos, Stendhal, or Balzac? Clearly not! We would not look at the bottom of the pages of Splendors and Miseries of the Courtisans for notes which would give formulas or recipes prescribing the procedures or ways to act in the bed-chamber. We do find here and there this sort of quite pragmatic note at the bottom of the pages of Juliette. Perhaps some of these notes have been added with a commercial object in view; perhaps they are not even from Sade's hand. Yet they do figure in the editions published during his lifetime; it would be false decency to wish to drop them from the text. They do belong with the subject-matter of the book. To say that they are devoid of literary interest would amount to understanding nothing of Sade's originality. These pragmatic notes belong to his purest irony. The irony however has no object if these notes do have pragmatic worth. In any case they are the index indicating the outside, and this outside is not at all the interior of the "bedroom" in which one philosophizes; it is the inwardness of thought which nothing separates from the "bedroom." After all the term "bedroom" is but persiflage-in Sade it designates the bloody cave of Cyclops, whose one eye is that of voracious thought. Thus the foreclosure of language by itself gives Sade's work its singu- lar configuration-first as a set of tales, discourses; then, of tableaux which count for something only through a sly invitation to go see outside what does not seem to hold together in the text, when nothing is visible anywhere but in the text. His work then is like the vast district of an urban showroom within a city, one with the city, where one passes without noticing it from the objects exhibited to objects that are exhibited fortuitously without being</page><page sequence="21">Sade 25 exhibitable. Finally one recognizes that it is to these that the corridors of the showroom lead. Translated by Alphonso Lingis Pennsylvania State University NOTES 1.
