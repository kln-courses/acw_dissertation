<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tyranny and Myth in the Plays of Four Contemporary Greek Dramatists By E. D. KARAMPETSOS The coup d'etat by the Oreek colonels in lyo/ put a damper on the traditionally lively Athenian theatre scene. Strict censor- ship, imposed by the military government, seemed to foreclose any possibility of its being revived. Theatre forms traditionally popular in Athens were ill-suited to the political realities, and as a result, the Greek theatre was compelled to transform itself. Its apparently coma- tose state in the late sixties proved to be only a transi- tional stage. Censorship played a greater role in deter- mining the nature of the Greek theatre during the final years of the dictatorship than did the idiosyncrasies of individual playwrights, the traditional preferences of the audience and even an apparent theoretical leaning to- ward the ideas of Brecht and Piscator. Among the most striking characteristics of the new theatre was the pro- duction of plays which fulfill the criteria for myth and ritual described in The Theater and Its Double by An- tonin Artaud. In these plays there are no anthropomorphic gods typical of classical myth. Instead there are new mythical figures representing man-made forces - economic, so- cial, political - which, having achieved superhuman proportions, have turned on their makers to oppress them. The protagonists of these contemporary myths usually do not have the unique, individualistic traits common in realistic drama; instead they are typical, Everyman characters representative of humanity in general. Despite their obvious debt to contemporary Western dramatic theory, the new Greek playwrights did more than imitate foreign models. Each work bears the in- dividual stamp of the dramatist's imagination and talent as well as reflecting the influence of the censor. In addi- tion, these plays appealed, as their immense popularity during the time of the dictatorship and only during that time indicates, to an indigenous transformation of the Greek theatregoer's sensibility. The theatre dealt with social and political needs by means of the esthetic experience. Incapable of changing the external world of the spectator, the theatrical performance provided a sublimation, a consolation and, ultimately, the source of a heightened awareness of common spiritual needs denied by the physical reality to which the Greek was obliged to conform. In the fifties and early sixties, before the imposition of the dictatorship, the Athenian theatre offered four basic choices: situation comedies; melodramas; revues with topical satire, music and plump dancers; and, from the West, serious plays. A typical theatre season, that of 1963-64, for example, offered the most successful plays from New York, London and Paris in addition to im- portant revivals. Bolt's A Man for All Seasons, Piran- dello's Tonight, We Improvise and Genet's The Balcony were among the imports. In their variety of interests, the Athenian theatregoers resembled their counter- parts in any democratic country. Reflecting the circumstances created by the dictator- ship, the taste of the Greek theatregoer changed radi- cally. In part, the change is evident in the kind of for- eign plays which began to draw large and enthusiastic audiences. Considering the traits shared by their gov- ernments with the Athens regime, it should not be sur- prising that Central Europe became an important source for new plays. Two of the biggest hits of the 1973-74 season were Tango by Polish playwright Slawomir Mrozek and The Holders of the Keys by the Czech Milan Kundera. Other plays were Havel's Memoran- dum and an adaptation of Jaroslav Hasek's Good Sol- dier Schwei\. Pavel Kohout, another Czech, had two plays, Poor Murderer and Augustus, Augustus, running concurrently. Many of the plays which came from the West during the same season were part of the dramatic tradition, described by Rosette Lamont as '"metaphysical farce," which inspired the Central European plays. Among these plays were Ionesco's The Thirst and the Hunger, Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit, Roger Vitrac's Victor, or The Children Ta\e Power and two different presentations of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi. Some of the plays mentioned above had been previously performed in Greece, but their revival during the 1973-74 season along with similar plays reinforces the impression that their return was due not to chance but to the fact that they served certain compelling needs of the audience. Further evidence of the reorientation of the Greek theatre audience is the acceptance of plays by serious contemporary Greek playwrights. Between 1970 and 1974 over fifty-two new plays by Greek dramatists were produced, something unheard of in modern Greece where audiences have normally preferred their "quali- ty" theatre to bear a foreign signature. Prominent</page><page sequence="2">KARAMPETSOS 211 among the many dramatists produced during this period are Yiorghos Kampanellis, who differs from the others in that he had produced several successful plays before 1967, Yiorghos Skourtis, Marietta Rialdi and Stratis Karras, whose plays will be discussed here. Kampanellis's "Our Great Circus" is a series of his- torical vignettes loosely tied together with songs and placards which underline their common significance. The scenes are set in classical Greece and in the Byzan- tium of 1821, the time of the Greek revolution. Greek history is presented as a ritual repetition of a modern Cronus myth whose motifs include internecine strife, revolt and betrayal. In "Our Great Circus" history and myth become one in a recurring nightmare of momen- tary glory subverted by treachery and transformed into defeat and subjugation. As in the ancient myth, Cronus swallows his children, but in Kampanellis's version of the myth, instead of a Zeus waiting in the wings to over- throw his tyrant father, there are brave persons willing to sacrifice themselves in a foredoomed insurrection against oppression. Kampanellis's play provides a dra- matic paraphrase of Ernst Cassirer's statement, "The myth of a people does not determine but is its fate." The fruit of the struggle is always snatched from those who fight. They are set aside and forgotten until long after their deaths, when they are no longer a threat/Then they are transformed by those who betrayed them into inoffensive symbols of patriotism, and statues are raised in their honor. In the first scene agents of Philip of Macedon bribe the priests to set up a new Pythia at Delphi in order to secure a favorable oracle against Demosthenes and those who support the idea of uniting the city-states against the outsiders. Romios (the Greek) and Romiaki (the little Greek), the ringmaster-interlocutors who oversee the "circus" and occasionally participate in it, make feverish preparations to receive Philip's agents at Delphi. Romiaki plays the replacement for the High Priestess of Delphi (the old one having been done away with in order to increase the likelihood of oracles fa- vorable to Philip). Romiaki and Romios frequently cross the line between their scenes of "historical" make- believe, and their function as observers, like the rest of the audience, is one of history. As in plays by Genet and Brecht, the manipulation of the "real" and the "make- believe" serves to emphasize the abstract context of the situation. Romiaki is both Romiaki and the new High Priestess. Simple soul that she is, she cannot believe that such un- derhanded skullduggery as she is called upon to perform is possible. She is terrified of being punished by Zeus for impersonating a priestess (until Romios, playing a priest in the pay of the Macedonians, assures her that Zeus too has been bought off), and at the same time she fears the consequences of failing her new masters. To bring herself and her nerves under control, the new High Priestess gets drunk and almost bungles her first oracle. Finally Philip gets what he wants, and the High Priestess is the first to give herself to his representatives. Kampanellis's audiences did not miss the mythical allusions to their own political experience. They were sure to associate the corrupt oracle and the contempo- rary affairs of the Greek Orthodox Church. Both dic- tators, George Papadopoulos and Dimitris Ioannidis, who overthrew the former, having taken secular affairs in hand, did not neglect the Greek Church. They had their men "elected" Archbishop of Athens and made certain that the official incense carried prayers on their behalf. Byzantium provides the setting for another reenact- ment of the myth. A beggar lavishes praise on An- dronicus, the usurper of the Byzantine throne, while revealing that Constantinople has been sold piecemeal to "allies" who have acquired port facilities and are greed- ily preparing for more. The revolutionary heroes of 1821 liberate Greece with their blood and in good faith greet the new king imposed on them by their "Christian protectors" of the Holy Alliance. They live to see the land they fought for divided up among Bavarian for- tune hunters and obsequious Greeks who failed to fight. Those who resist too much are permanently disposed of with the gift donated by their French protectors, the guillotine. The choice left to the heroes of 1821 is be- tween death and servitude as porters for the rich and the powerful. In the manner of Brecht, Kampanellis links the scenes of his play with songs which summarize the action and focus on its meaning. Underlying each scene are the motifs of the Cronus myth. All mythical heroes must struggle against the crushing forces of nature or, in Kampanellis's case, against the movement of history. What is reasserted, as each mythical hero takes arms against the forces which will eventually destroy him, is the indomitable nature of humanity. The myth is cy- clical because there is always a new hero to rise up against the tyrants, whoever they are. Thus "Our Great Circus" is redeemed by those who never forget their pride or sell out. Because they renew a foredoomed struggle, Kampanellis gives these heroes a special dignity. Conspiratorial euphoria and camaraderie dominated performances of "Our Great Circus" and of Skourtis's "Karaghiozis, Almost a Vizir." Whereas Kampanellis uses ancient Greek myth for the basic structure of "Our Great Circus," Skourtis taps the popular folk art of the shadow theatre. Its characters with their simple, cari- catural personalities are archetypes of the Greek ex- perience. Hadjiavatis is the bearded worshiper of au-</page><page sequence="3">212 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY thority and the constant companion of Karaghiozis. Stavrakas is the swaggering but cowardly tough who represents the lowlife of harbor cities. The Turks, in- cluding Mustafa Bey, Veligekas and the Vizir, are as powerful and capricious as the forces of nature. Kara- ghiozis, the Hellenized hero of the Turkish shadow theatre, needs all his cunning to survive in a world of injustice and violence. In using traditional folk charac- ters and situations to make a commentary on the pres- ent, Skourtis participates in a tradition of sedition typical of shadow theatre in Mediterranean countries once part of the Ottoman Empire. The traditional setting of plays about Karaghiozis presents the palace of the local Turkish dignitary on one side of the screen and Karaghiozis's hovel on the other. Most of Skourtis's play is set in the Vizir's throne room. However, in re-creating the traditional struggle between the haves and the have-nots, Skourtis does not permit us to forget for one moment that Karaghiozis and his friends live their lives in misery and poverty. The lives they are forced to lead have left indelible evidence in their personalities and their physical ap- pearance. Their typically exaggerated gestures, their un- motivated and endless violence and an atmosphere charged with greed and conspiracy all recall the puppet- like figures of Jarry's Ubu rot. Karaghiozis's hump (the symbol of oppression and countless beatings) and an exceptionally long arm (to provide a longer reach when he is stealing, begging or pummeling Hadjiavatis or one of his sons) describe his nature and condition as vividly as Ubu's pear-shaped frame. Karaghiozis's ad- venture begins because the Vizir is beset by his own courtiers who seek to overthrow him. To save his throne he calls upon the ever-ravenous and cunning Kara- ghiozis and his friends, who through sheer blundering luck manage to drive out the rebels and find themselves the possessors of an empty throne vacated by the terri- fied Vizir. Karaghiozis places himself on the throne and discovers its ability to provide him and his party with abundant food. His scepter, quite appropriately, is a large soup ladle (which recalls Jarry's more audacious use of a toilet cleaning brush for the same purpose). Power is the source of food, and soon Karaghiozis and his cohorts are groaning with distended stomachs. In the meantime the Vizir, reconciled with his chas- tened lieutenants, returns to recapture the privileges abandoned to the common people. The unprepared Karaghiozis is as decisive a leader as Ubu when he comes under strong attack. He quickly finds himself dethroned and hungry again. The parallel with the al- most bloodless coup of 21 April 1967 is clear. Anyone who wants power must be organized enough and willing enough to hold on to it. Those who cannot hold power must learn to live with it; this is the subject of "Oust," Marietta Rialdi's tragic satire. "Oust" opens with the scene of a dreamlike bourgeois party. The actors' words are drawn out and meaningless. Only Eriphili's crawling around the small stage bare-breasted while muttering incomprehensibly enlivens the scene. The dream becomes a nightmare with the entry of Ok. Wearing a long, double-breasted overcoat, beard, glasses and a military top, Ok an- nounces that the City has just been saved. Of course everyone is grateful, but beyond that, they are also curious. They would like to know who has been saved and from whom. Ok refuses to go into details. When Ok leaves there are new efforts to simulate lighthearted gaiety. However, the rather feeble effusive- ness evaporates as the guests begin, without reason, to suspect one another of being linked to those from whom the city has been rescued. The party is interrupted a second time by Ok, who is pursuing a fugitive said to be responsible for allegedly threatening to create a disturbance at the railway station. The suspect must be apprehended in order to restore civic calm and confi- dence in the government. Ok appeals to Xenophon's patriotism and cupidity to stand in for the guilty party. Cooperation with the new regime will mean a short stay in jail, but the City will be saved and a substantial reward will be waiting for Xenophon when he is re- leased from prison. Some of the other guests are induced to testify against him. After the undercover hero has been led to prison, the guests, reviewing the evening's events, come to believe that he is truly guilty. Adelai'da and Hippocrates, the hosts, decide to play along with the new government, as they did with those which preceded it. They spy on their neighbors and show up at public meetings to applaud the leader and jeer at those out of favor. They take care of the govern- ment and the government takes care of them. As he must, the Leader eventually falls, and the City is rescued by new saviors in search of new scapegoats and col- laborators. Accustomed as they are to tyranny, the citi- zens of the City easily fall in step. Only Eriphili, who is young and beautiful, cannot survive living perma- nently in a prison, and the final scene becomes her death rite. "Oust" is a nightmarish charade of the real world. Each regime, whatever its pretensions, is like the one it overthrows. Each revolutionary government seeks to legitimize its oppressive and irrational existence by re- sorting to the claim that the security of the state is in peril. It seeks and creates scapegoats from among the innocent and uninvolved populace. Operating on the principle that those who are not for it are against it, the government coerces citizens to become informers and perjurers in exchange for material rewards and security. Apart from the obvious political allusions in the play,</page><page sequence="4">KARAMPETSOS 213 its effect is to magnify the horror of the mechanism of oppression contained in "Oust" 's central myth. Rialdi's characters and their situations are too vague and too changeable to be ascribed to a specific source. At the same time the audience is led to the unavoidable con- sciousness of its own fears and insecurities in a world where heroes and traitors are manufactured from among its members in order to sustain the organized irrationality of the colonels. Whereas Rialdi creates a bizarre, dreamlike world whose horror is mitigated by humor, the plays of Stratis Karras engender anguish without relief. In Karras's "The Troupers" there is endless waiting for events which fail to take place and suffering because of un- wanted events which do occur. The effect of "The Troupers" is cumulative, a bit like seeing a particularly nasty dream several nights in a row. Karras's characters, seedy sideshow performers, earn their insecure liveli- hoods by brutally punishing themselves in order to entertain others. There are two sets of performers with similar acts competing for work from the same im- presario. The competition between these characters in- creases their anguish and leads them to even more self- destructive behavior. Their competitive and insecure status is a gruesome parody of the world of the Greek worker : a world of unemployment and extreme com- petition for the few places which do exist, made even more unbearable by a tyrannical state. Miltos and Melpos perform short skits in which Melpos impersonates a woman. Miltos is the first to enter the rural cafe where they have supposedly been hired to perform. When he enters he is happy, but the cafe is filled with threatening objects. He finds placards and is unable to determine whether they are for or against the "situation." Their discovery might lead to the cancellation of the performance. Worse yet, he could be punished if he is caught near them. Is it a trap ? Obviously there is room for fear, but it cannot be de- fined or discussed. A blind man rides a bicycle onstage, but his answers to Miltos's questions only add to the confusion. Melpos adds his nervous sense of unpreparedness to the scene. He and Miltos must set up the stage and rehearse. Next Londos, whose gimmick is the sys- tematic devouring of an automobile, comes in with his mother. Londos suffers terribly because digesting automobile parts worsens his ulcer, but it is the only work he knows. The three performers wait with feverish anticipation for the Impresario who engaged them. For all of them work will mean an end to their suffering. The Impresario never appears. Instead the blind cyclist returns from time to time to add to their anxiety with his cryptic words. To make matters worse, per- formers with acts paralleling those of Miltos, Melpos and Londos arrive. They claim to have been hired by the same Impresario and boast of their superior talents. Melpos, Miltos and Londos redouble their efforts to im- press their employer. The play ends unresolved as the stage lights slowly fade out on the frantic preparations of the six actors. Karras and his fellow dramatists create ritual and myth, as Artaud suggested it should be, from the ob- sessions of their contemporaries. Their abstract charac- ters and situations are expressions of recurring elements in the history of the Greek nation which the military dictatorship only served to accentuate. If it is possible to gauge the atmosphere which prevailed in Greece dur- ing the dictatorship, surely the plays which I have dis- cussed and others like them are an accurate measure- ment. With the fall of the dictatorship in 1974, the needs of the audience changed. The restoration of democracy in Greece brought about the abolition of most forms of censorship and resulted in a so-called "crisis" in the theatre. Theatres which had enjoyed a large and grow- ing patronage suddenly found themselves empty. Audi- ences became unpredictable once again and sought variety where previously they could only be satisfied with variations on the theme of oppression. The 1975-76 season saw the comeback of the revue. The dictatorship and the new political situation pro- vided ample material for their satirical skits. There was a backlog of previously forbidden material to perform. Playwrights such as Kampanellis and Skourtis were still looking for their bearings. Kampanellis's "The Peo- ple Are the Enemy," although it drew large crowds attracted by the playwright's reputation, a musical score by the previously banned Mikis Theodorakis and a first- rate cast, lacked the power of "Our Great Circus." The social and political situation can be blamed for part of the lessened audience response, but once possessing the freedom to be more realistic and to appeal to the intel- lect, Kampanellis might be said to have neglected his ability to touch the emotions. Likewise Skourtis's "The Strike" with its simplistic, agitprop construction is only a boring lecture in comparison with the fierce humor of his adaptation of the Karaghiozis tradition. Only Rialdi's "Concentration Camp City" retains the mythical and ritual elements typical of her previous plays, despite the use of more explicit political and sexual humor. What are the conclusions one can draw from this ac- count of the development of Greek theatre? One can say that the playwrights discussed here were forced by the limits of censorship to seek new ways of communi- cating with their audiences. In the resultant flowering of Greek drama they discovered not only that they were capable of creating compelling drama despite the limi-</page><page sequence="5">214 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY tations imposed upon them (perhaps because of them), but that there exist large audiences capable of appre- ciating what they produced. Perhaps the present crisis of the Greek theatre should not be attributed to the Athenian audience, which is accused of having deserted it for television and other lesser forms of entertainment, but to the dramatists themselves, who failed to learn from their success with the abstract, indirect forms of myth and ritual and have instead strayed from their audiences.
