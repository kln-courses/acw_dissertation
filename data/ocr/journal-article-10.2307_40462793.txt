Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, 1991. viii + 184 pp., map, illus., photos, tab., fig. Price: skr 285.- With this book, Kongo studies (of Western Bantu of coastal Zaire, Congo, and Angola) reach another point in the availability of research materials for scholars and interested laymen. The goal of scholarship on a cultural tradition surely includes making available original texts and cultural products for posterity, with translation and interpretation based on the best current understanding. Wyatt MacGaffey has here provided the most extensive published work yet seen on a central yet for most out- siders a very esoteric aspect of historic Kongo culture: the world of the nkisi. One limited dimension of these objects, that which produced anthropomorphic wooden sculptures, is found widely in the homes and shops of Western art collectors, and in art and ethnographic museums. Almost universally, these nkisi figures are misrepresented. "Art and Healing of the Bakongo" elucidates the Kongo nkisi through an examination of a segment of indigenous texts and museum artifacts collected from ca. 1910 to 1920 by Swedish linguist-missionary Karl La- man from 67 teacher-catechists of the Swedish Covenant Church located throughout the Lower Congo. Although Laman himself produced the well-known KiKongo dic- tionary, and a four-volume Kongo monograph from this material, the original authors and their integral texts, as well as the sense of local culture which they conveyed, Anthropos 88.1993</page><page sequence="2">260 Rezensionen was lost from view in the final works and further trans- lations. MacGaffey has coordinated the KiKongo texts of the catechists (identified as individual ethnographer- authors), the illustrations of the minkisi available in the Swedish Ethnographic Museum, given them clear geographical designations, and translated the texts into English. He has also given the subject of nkisi his own very insightful analysis. The book offers an introduction to the Laman col- lection, its regional sources, biographical sketches of some of the catechist-ethnographers, interpretive essays by MacGaffey on the nkisi objects, their composition, texts, and special vocabulary. The sections devoted to particular nkisi and the translation of texts are organized into those pertaining to divination (7), healing (22), wealth and warfare (10), and attack (6). Appendices and lists identify the original authors, which of the 429 notebooks they wrote, the minkisi by locality of origin, where they are found in the original notebooks, where they are found in Laman's writings, along with pertinent museum identification information. This is, in effect, a "catalogue raisonné" of some 370 minkisi in the Laman corpus of texts, artifacts, and other derivative documents. Part of the mystification and negation that has oc- curred around the western Equatorial African nkisi is that there is really no translation for it in Western lan- guages because there is no comparable institution in European culture. Thus, grossly distorted terms such as fetish, magical or power object, and medicine have been used both in the popular and scholarly literature. MacGaffey' s working definition of nkisi is a paragraph- long description (4) that spells out the full range of procedures that are done, and products that are typically created, in a nkisi. Thus, nkisi "is a personalised force from the invisible land of the dead [that] has chosen, or been induced, to submit itself to some degree of human control effected through ritual performances" (4). This ritual requires an expert; the ritual may be more or less elaborate, requiring from a few minutes to years to com- plete, involving an individual or an entire community; entailing songs, dances, behavioral restrictions, prepared spaces, material apparatuses; these apparatuses may in- clude musical instruments, the bodies of the participants, articles of costume, cosmetics, plants; a focal object in the nkisi may embody the potency or sacredness of a spiritual entity. MacGaffey' s current projects on nkisi as art would extend this understanding to liken them more to ac- tion or performance art, mnemonic devices that utilize verbal and visual puns, that elaborate metaphoric and métonymie statements about areas of life that are full of threat, interest, vitality, or power. Important about "Art and Healing" is that MacGaffey has brought this unique feature of Kongo, more widely Western Bantu, culture, back from the rigid reification it has known within Western stereotypes and commen- taries. He has begun to demystify what the Western view has usually mystified in order to negate. Yet this book will not be particularly easy for the uninitiated to read; it remains a technical book. But whoever wishes to study almost any aspect of Western- Central African societies, where the nkisi is known, will find this masterful and focused work a key to cultural analysis. John M.
