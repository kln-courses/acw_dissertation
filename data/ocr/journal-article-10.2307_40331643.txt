<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Deer and Dolphins: Nage Ideas Regarding Animal Transformation Gregory Forth University of Alberta ABSTRACT According to the Nage of eastern Indonesia, certain animals regularly transform into animals of another kind. Similar beliefs - specified here as notions of 'contemporary zoological transfor- mation' - have been documented for Malays and at least one other Indonesian society, as well as for the Kalam and Rofaifo of New Guinea. Referring to interpretations by ethnographers of these other societies, the paper analyses the Nage beliefs in regard to their connection with observation of zoological kinds. Attention is also given to their possible utilitarian value, con- nection with ethnozoological classification, and relation to similar yet distinct transformations encountered in myth and spiritual representations. Drawing on Atran's thesis (1990), it is con- cluded that Nage beliefs in contemporary animal transformation posit changes of essence and are in this sense counter-intuitive. At the same time, certain ontological features demonstrate that the beliefs cannot be accommodated to a category of mythological or religious representa- tions, and that in several respects they share more in common with modern scientific thought. Along with some other traditional peoples, the Nage of eastern Indonesia claim that certain animal kinds regularly transform into animals of other kinds. Nage thus assert that insect lar- vae turn into tiny bats, flying foxes into palm civets, and deer into dolphins (see Table 1). While transformation beliefs have received surprisingly little attention from either ethnobiolo- gists or cognitive anthropologists, several students of folk zoology (see Bulmer 1968; Dwyer 1976; Ellen 1985, 1993) have considered how such ideas, in particular ethnographic settings, may be connected with utilitarian or other functional values, larger conceptual or ideological systems, and with features of ethnozoological classification. A review of the evidence shows all of these approaches to be of very limited applicability to Nage ideas. Comparing what I specify as 'contemporary zoological transformations' with other transformations posited by Nage, both in myth and in their version of present day reality, I endeavour to situate the beliefs in relation both to other seemingly fantastic metamorphoses and to other kinds of empirically grounded knowledge about the natural world. In so doing I consider Nage transformation ideas within a framework suggested by Atran (1990), who posits a radical separation of ethno- biological classification or knowledge founded on a universal apprehension of essential differ- ences, from mythical or religious knowledge which is basically counter-intuitive and partly able to ignore such differences. Insofar as they are not obviously mythical or religious in char- acter, Nage beliefs in contemporary animal transformation appear to challenge this distinction. PRELIMINARY ISSUES The Nage are an interior people, about 50,000 in number, who reside in south-central Flores just to the north and west of the Ebu Lobo volcano. They are subsistence cultivators, stock raisers and hunters who nowadays practise a combination of swidden and more permanent Oceania 6%, 1998 271</page><page sequence="2">On Deer and Dolphins field cultivation, and in some areas irrigated rice culture. Domestic animals include water buffalo, horses, pigs and goats. The principal game animals are deer and wild swine. Nage residing in and around the main village of Bo'a Wae, the region where all the ideas dis- cussed below were recorded, are highlanders living at some distance from the sea. Nevertheless, they occasionally visit coastal areas to the south and north for purposes of contracting marriages and trade. For comparative purposes it is important to specify what is meant by contemporary zoological transformation. I employ the phrase to refer to the idea that members of certain animal kinds living at present (thus at the same time as those who hold the beliefs, and not at some point in the mythological past) turn permanently into members of other kinds. Transformation ideas of this sort are reported for several parts of the world. The European belief that barnacle geese develop from barnacles is well known. For North America, Hunn records a belief found among the Tzeltal of Chiapas, according to which shrews that are able to jump across a trail are transformed into bats (1977:208-09). Instances of transforma- tion ideas have also been reported for the Kalam (or Karam; Bulmer 1968, Bulmer and Menzies 1972-3) and the Rofaifo of New Guinea (Dwyer 1976). Like the American exam- ple, New Guiñean transformations appear to apply to a more limited range of species than do Nage beliefs. (For example, Kalam instances concern only rodents and marsupials; worms, snakes and eels; and two species of birds of paradise.) Information on the incidence of belief in contemporary zoological transformation in other parts of Flores is limited. Some ideas of this sort, all involving snakes and lizards, are encountered in the Manggarai region of western Flores (A. K. Molnar, pers. comm.), but their occurrence is not confirmed for the Ngadha, the immediate western neighbours of the Nage. Although several Nage transforma- tion beliefs appear in the Keo region, immediately to the south, I have yet to pursue the topic extensively there, and I have no information for other parts of Flores.1 Comparative research is not sufficiently advanced to judge how common transforma- tion beliefs may be in Austronesian-speaking societies outside Flores. The most detailed account concerns the Nuaulu of central Seram as described by Ellen, whose analysis I review later on (1993). Skeat (1900) reports a number of Malay beliefs in animal transfor- mation, but does not always distinguish clearly between contemporary transformations and ones relating solely to mythical origins.2 Since both the languages of Flores and Nuaulu have been classified as members of a Central Malayo-Polynesian group (Blust 1979), while Malay is a Western Malayo-Polynesian language, the appearance of several unequivocal instances of a belief in contemporary zoological metamorphosis among Malays however shows that such ideas are not confined to just one part of the Austronesian-speaking region. At the same time, evidence for the belief is lacking in standard works on Borneo (see e.g. Evans 1922, 1953, 1970). Nor is it clearly present among non-Austronesian aboriginal pop- ulations of Peninsular Malaysia (see e.g. Dentan 1968; Endicott 1979; Karim 1981) despite the many instances of transformation found in the mythology and spiritual representations of these groups (see e.g. Endicott 1979:66 regarding spirits, gibbons, and leopards; and Karim 1981:230-2 on myths describing powers of metamorphoses formerly possessed by the 'crow pheasant , apparently Centropus sp.). One therefore gains the impression that the particular kind of belief we are concerned with here either is uncommon in insular Southeast Asia or for some reason has often gone unreported.3 While recognizing questions raised by the use of 'belief in contexts where local scep- ticism is almost as common as conviction, I retain the term to describe Nage ideas about animal transformations partly to accord with the usage of earlier authors (e.g. Bulmer 1968, Dwyer 1976), and partly because English offers no significantly better alternative. In what follows, 'belief should be understood as referring to a generally well known idea accepted as true by some Nage or, if not personally maintained, then known to be regarded as true by other Nage. As this should suggest, not every Nage believes in all transformations, and one encounters a good deal of variation with regard to particular beliefs. Further qualifying this 272</page><page sequence="3">Forth use of 'belief is the circumstance that people who entertain or subscribe to particular trans- formations tend to express them as straightforward matters of fact or as hearsay. Either way, they do not clearly form part of any systematic cultural dogma, nor, as I later elaborate, do they have any obvious religious or ideological value. TABLE 1.

Table 1 lists transformation pairs recognized by the Nage of Bo'a Wae. Nage express all these metamorphoses with bale, meaning 'to become, to turn into, change into' (cf. Wurm and Wilson 1975 s.v. 'change', regarding Austronesian protoforms).4 More elabo- rately, they describe transforming animals as creatures 'that transform entirely' (ta 'a tolo</page><page sequence="4">On Deer and Dolphins bale), that are 'capable of transformation' {bale [or bali] be' o), or that 'transform them- selves' (bale beki). As Table 1 makes clear, transformations expressed with bale include both zoologically valid and invalid metamorphoses. Since there are probably more valid transformations known to Nage than are recorded in the Table, those listed should be con- sidered illustrative rather than exhaustive. As a general term expressing the idea of one thing turning into another, Nage further use bale to describe other kinds of transformation, some of which concern humans, plants and inanimate objects (astral bodies, minerals, and so on) as well as animals. Instances are included in Table 2, where they are articulated with contemporary zoological transforma- tions. As this Table shows, other instances of transformation comprise mythic varieties (ones described only in traditional narratives) as well as both mythic and non-mythic instances wherein transformation is temporary and reversible. There are also two instances of non-mythic, permanent transformation involving humans or human souls.5 Whether these distinctions relate to ontological differences subsumed under the common rubric is a possi- bility I merely indicate for the present and address in detail later on. TABLE 2: VARIETIES OF NAGE TRANSFORMATIONS (with examples) I Mythic transformations: permanent, irreversible Ì. human - &gt;animal Myths in which a child beaten by an elder sibling (sex unspecified) is transformed into a monkey ( 'o a), or a neglected little girl changes into a kete dhèngi bird (forest whistler, Pachycephala nudigula). 2. animal - &gt;human The story of Pénu Ga'e who derives from a large fish (ika, kind unspecified) caught by her future husband, Wégu the Orphan. 3. human - &gt;plant A widespread origin myth in which parts of a young woman's corpse are transformed into rice (pae) and other food plants. 4. plant - &gt;human A myth that relates how the original people of clan Tiwa Feo derived from candlenuts (feo) gathered by a childless ancestral couple. 5. human -&gt;mineral A myth recounting how a woman, Ine Buka Saju, turned into a rock after witnessing the collision of two rivers (Ae Sésa and Lowo Lele). 6. human &gt;astronomical body A myth in which an incestuous sister and brother are transformed into the constellation of the Pleiades (ho) and Antares (wawi to). 7. animal - &gt;animal The myth of Wégu the Orphan, in which water buffalo (bhada, Bubalus bubalis) derive from maggots (ule) that infest the carcass of a large snake (nipa). 8. animal - &gt;mineral A myth in which the father of a female spirit provides her with a riding horse which later transforms into a large boulder. 9. astronomical body - &gt;astronomical body An origin myth in which one of two original suns (leza) is transformed to become the moon (wula). 274</page><page sequence="5">Forth II MYTHIC TRANSFORMATIONS: TEMPORARY, REVERSIBLE 10. human&lt; - &gt;animal A myth in which two ancestral brothers, having attained exceptional powers from a free spirit, respectively change into a dog flea (mèla) and a type of small mosquito (sisi emu) and later 'turn back into humans' (bali wali kita ata). In the same myth, spirit females alternately assume the form of human beings and fish (ika). III NON-MYTHIC TRANSFORMATIONS: PERMANENT, IRREVERSIBLE 1 1 . human - &gt;animal Aborted foetuses as well as the souls (mae) of infants become kete dhéngi birds (Pachycephala nudigula; cf. transformation type 1:1 above). 12.

See Table 1 IV NON-MYTHIC TRANSFORMATIONS: TEMPORARY, REVERSIBLE 14. animal&lt; - &gt;human Certain large male buffalo (designated as bali be' o, '(ones that) know how to trans- form') turn into humans, temporarily taking the form of their owners or other men. 15. plant&lt; - &gt;human hebu tree (Cassia fistula)&lt; - &gt;human male (This applies also to certain objects fashioned of hebu wood) 16. plant&lt; - &gt;animal hebu tree &lt; - &gt; wawi witu (wild pig) 17. spirit&lt; - &gt;human/animal Nitu and other free spirits can assume the form of human beings and various animals (snakes, fish, butterflies, monkeys). The guardian spirit of water buffalo (ga'e bhada or mae mango bhada) can temporarily take the form of a bull buffalo, a python (goka; Python spp.), or a human male. Souls (mae) of deceased humans can manifest them- selves as harmless snakes (nipa) and other animals. Witches (polo), or the malevolent spirit possessed by witches (wa polo), are described as taking the form of various ani- mals (e.g. snakes, dogs, owls) or of a particular human being. Defining beliefs in contemporary animal transformation as entailing a change of one animal kind into another raises the question of how one is to understand 'kind'. The issue of course equally applies to the formulations of authors (e.g. Ellen 1993:163) who have described animals changing into another 'species'. Responding to questioning, Nage claimed that members of transformation pairs comprise two distinct 'jenis', here employing the Indonesian (or Malay) term for 'kind, type, species'. Thus it was regularly agreed, for example, that tadpoles and frogs constituted two separate 'jenis'. It is difficult, however, to know exactly how 'jenis' is understood in this context; for in reference to different animal taxa, the Nage language does not employ words that correspond to English 'kind' (as for example in 'there are three kinds'; see Forth [1995:56-8]), or for that matter to Malay 'jenis9. A need for caution is especially signalled by the statement of one man who described frogs as different in kind (' jenis9) from tadpoles even while asserting that tad- poles came from 'frogs' eggs' (spawn). 275</page><page sequence="6">On Deer and Dolphins On the other hand, Nage do distinguish transforming kinds from immature stages of a single kind, generally specified as ana ('child'). Usually, Nage do not speak of immature animals 'transforming' (bale) into adult forms;6 and it is mostly mature, and often old, ani- mals that they expressly describe as undergoing transformation. The point is further illus- trated by reference to the metamorphosis of tadpoles into frogs. Nage do not recognize tad- poles as 'immature frogs' (ana pake); rather immature frogs are for them transformations of mature tadpoles. In fact, the only clear exception to transforming animals being older speci- mens is the metamorphosis of young Russell's vipers into eels. Transformation pairs also differ from developmental stages insofar as the former are asymmetrical and unidirectional. For example, while Nage claim that flying foxes regularly transform into palm civets, they do not think that civets give birth to young bats, but only to young civets. Possible excep- tions include frogs, insofar as Nage recognize that tadpoles derive from 'frogs' eggs', and flies, since the expression hale bale ule ('flies transform into maggots') means that 'flies' eggs' develop into maggots (ule), which most people recognize as turning into flies. Indicating a final difference between transformation beliefs and ideas about maturation is the circumstance that some transforming kinds can give rise to more than one other named kind. Caterpillars, for example, are said to turn into gake (large butterflies) as well as into bhébha (all smaller butterflies). Worthy of mention in this connection is an instance where an animal is described as reproducing offspring of its own as well as another kind (cf. Dwyer 1976:197). Nage thus claim that both crow fledglings and the young of the com- mon koel (muta mae; Eudynamis scolopacea) hatch from the eggs of crows (ha; Corvus macrorhynchus) - a statement that approaches scientific validity insofar as the koel, a large black cuckoo, parasitizes crows. Describing the Rofaifo of New Guinea, Dwyer (1976:196) states that, in the Rofaifo view, not all tadpoles turn into frogs, and that some frogs grow from immature frogs not derived from tadpoles (see also Bulmer 1968; Bulmer and Menzies 1972-3). In contrast, Nage usually responded positively to the direct question of whether all individual members of transforming kinds eventually transform. As one man put it, so long as a transforming animal does not die before it matures, it will inevitably transform. At the same time, even strong subscribers to transformation beliefs are in many instances aware - for example, from witnessing pregnant females or newborn animals - that both transforming species and their transformed products reproduce after their own kind. Categorical assertions about ani- mal transformation are also contradicted by indications that it is sometimes only particular specimens that transform. For example, Nage describe only aged male deer turning into dol- phins. The issue is further clouded by equivocal responses to direct questions (which were almost certainly novel for Nage), while descriptions of habits involved in reproduction and infant nurture (e.g. suckling) were most emphatically proffered by sceptics adducing them in support of their disbelief. Even so, the recognized fact that both members of transforma- tion pairs reproduce their own kind does not in itself prove that some members of the meta- morphosing kind do not undergo the transformation. As regards reproductive habits, it is moreover noteworthy that Nage describe the products of some metamorphoses as never being observed giving birth or otherwise possessing natural offspring. Examples include tiny bats ('ighu), biting eels (tuna balo) and two kinds of snakes (mépu and sawa). MORPHOLOGICAL RESEMBLANCE AND ECOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION Referring to beliefs in contemporary zoological transformation elsewhere, several authors (Bulmer 1968; Dwyer 1976; Ellen 1993) have discussed the role observation of nature and manifest resemblance might play in their development and maintenance. In support of par- ticular beliefs, Nage do indeed cite features of morphology, behaviour, diet or habitat shared by members of transformation pairs. There also appears to be some correlation between bio- logical validity, linked with opportunities for observation, and the number of Nage who 276</page><page sequence="7">Forth subscribe to particular transformations. Since the nature and extent of reported similarities vary from instance to instance, it is useful to review particular pairs separately, beginning with scientifically invalid metamorphoses. (a) 'Bamboo grubs turn into tiny bats' (ulegu bale 'ighu). This transformation concerns an edible larva, up to five or six cm in length, which infests the stems of large bamboo of the genus Gigantochloa (gu). According to some Nage, grubs called ule pezi, found in a bamboo locally designated as pezi (possibly another species of Gigantochloa', see Verheijen 1990), undergo the same transformation.7 'Ighu denotes tiny bats, probably more than one species, which inhabit the hollow internodes of gu, where they are sometimes encountered when cutting the bamboo. When the grubs reach their full size, Nage say, they ascend internally to the tops of bamboo stems where they change into small bats and fly away. One informant claimed to have witnessed these 'bam- boo grubs' developing wings and feet, an observation that is undoubtedly accurate insofar as their adult form would appear to be a large winged insect. While I am unable to provide a field identification for 'ighu, it is likely that the Nage taxon includes bamboo bats of the genus Tylonycteris. With a total length ranging from 60 to 105 mm, the bats are described in the literature as entering the hollow joints of Gigantochloa bamboo through cracks in order to roost, behaviour to which their small and flattened heads are particularly well adapted (Nowak 1991:349-50). Vertical cracks provid- ing points of entry originate as the pupation chamber and emergence hole of a Chrysomelid beetle (Lasiochila goryi). However, ule gu more likely denotes the larvae of a large brown or pale-coloured moth, possibly a sort that also pupates in or on stems of bamboo (R.C.West pers. comm.). Beetles of the family Chrysomelidae, on the other hand, are implicated in another (and apparently valid) transformation (see Table 1, s.v. gilo, possibly Sagra longi- collis)? Although entomological details could be clearer, there is thus good reason to suppose that this transformation belief is mostly derived from a coincidence of habitat between tiny bats and larvae of a flying insect. While the posited transformation is invalid, the original kind does indeed undergo metamorphosis, changing furthermore into a moth - a creature that flies nocturnally and which in size, shape and colour is not dissimilar to a tiny bat. Hence, indirectly, both morphological and behavioural resemblance between natural kinds may play a significant role as well. Referring to an intriguingly similar transformation from beetle larvae to butterflies to bats postulated by the Rofaifo of New Guinea, Dwyer con- cludes in much the same vein that this idea may ultimately refer to 'the metamorphoses of wood-boring moth larvae and the cryptic behaviour of moths and bats alike' (1976:204). (b) 'Tiny bats turn into a larger kind of bat; larger bats then turn into flying foxes' ( 'Ighu bale gébu; gébu bale méte). Insofar as Nage belief in the transformation of 'bamboo grubs' into 'ighu (or 'bamboo bats') finds support in common local experience, it may be significant that this belief is more widely held than others. Indeed, Nage are more sceptical about the further transforma- tion of 'ighu into a larger kind of bat (gébu), and subsequently into a flying fox, or large fruit bat (méte). Undoubtedly the notions have some basis in numerous morphological and behavioural similarities among bats. It is also noteworthy that méte denotes the largest of local Cheiroptera, while gébu is applied to bats intermediate in size between méte and 'ighu. Thus the representation involves a sequential transformation from the smallest to the largest kind. Although possessing no generic term for 'bats', Nage recognize the three kinds as composing a covert category within a larger 'bird' taxon (Forth 1996). Whether 'ighu or méte (Pteropus sp., probably P. lombocensis) is more focal to the category is unclear. More certain is the status of gébu as the most peripheral of the three. It is also quite probable that this taxon - which I have been unable to identify from the zoological literature - is applied 277</page><page sequence="8">On Deer and Dolphins to any bat which, in regard to size, is intermediate between the other two, perhaps including small or immature méte and large members of species otherwise classified as 'ighu. (c) 'Flying foxes turn into palm civets' (méte bale bheku). The five part series involving bat metamorphosis is completed by the transformation of flying foxes into palm civets (bheku; Paradoxurusjiermaphroditus). Interestingly, the trans- formation of the large bats into civets appears to be more widely known even than that of 'ighu into progressively larger members of the Cheiroptera. According to local accounts, the animals' form, size, habitat, and diet provide extensive support for this transformation. Morphologically, flying foxes and civets are most often described as resembling one anoth- er in head shape and facial appearance. Nage also describe the bats as somewhat smaller than mature civets, explicitly adducing this as evidence of the metamorphosis. In the same context, they further claim that old flying foxes grow prominent tails.9 When the tail begins to grow - reputedly to about the length of a man's finger - this is a sure sign that the animal is about to turn into a civet, an animal with a long tail. Behaviourally, both palm civets and flying foxes are recognized as nocturnal, as occu- pying similar habitats, and as having similar diets. As Nage remark, both animals are com- monly found in the tops of tall palms and other large, fruit-bearing trees, as well as on large forest vines, from which the bats are sometimes seen hanging during the daytime. Both also inhabit holes in trees. Although only civets are known to be omnivorous, both animals feed on soft fruits, including the fruit of the Arenga palm, bananas, papaya, and mangoes. Where Nage tap palms, civets as well as fruit bats also consume palm sap (hence the English name for the civet, 'toddy cat'; Schliemann 1989:524). As one man pointed out, since the diet of the two animals is very similar, so is their spoor. Yet another resemblance Nage mentioned was the similar smell and taste of their flesh. Some Nage claim there are actually two kinds of flying foxes which transform into two kinds of palm civets. The bats comprise a larger and darker variety called méte ha ('crow méte') and a lighter sort named méte wula ('moon méte'). The first then changes into a commoner and darker sort of civet. Most often, it seems, civets of this variety are simply named bheku, although one man reckoned they should be specified as bheku koba, 'forest vine civet'. As might be expected, the lighter sort of flying fox is described as transforming into the lighter kind of civet, or bheku wula. At the same time, one informant denied this transformation, arguing that it is only larger and darker bats, the méte ha, that change into civets. It is unclear whether these contrasts refer to variations within species or, as seems less likely, between different species of fruit bats and civets; but a possible source of the distinc- tion is the yellow and light grey patches reported on the coats of both civets and flying foxes (Diicker 1975:154; Eisentraut 1975:100). As regards their local classificatory status, it is also uncertain how widely the contrast is recognized. As usually expressed, the transfor- mation simply involves 'flying foxes changing into palm civets' (méte bale bheku), while during earlier investigations into Nage classification of 'birds' the distinction of two sorts of méte only partly emerged (see Forth 1996:98, 107). Nevertheless, there is reason to suppose that what Nage observe to be parallel variations in fur colouring and marking within local populations of the two mammal kinds may be taken as support of the transformation belief, complementing perceived other resemblances in outward appearance. If there is one morphological factor that could account for the transformation of flying foxes being less widely accepted than, for example, that of bamboo grubs into tiny bats, it is that flying foxes have wings. As even supporters acknowledge, these must disappear in the metamorphosis. Recalling the directional quality of many transformation beliefs noted by Dwyer (1976; see below), Nage representations involving the disappearance of physical features do indeed tend to be less readily accepted than ones that involve their appearance. At the same time, when describing their observation of tadpole development, Nage regu- 278</page><page sequence="9">Forth larly mention the disappearance of tails, a phenomenon which seemed not to evoke any sceptical response. (d) 'Land snails turn into catfish' (boko lo bale ika léle). While the foregoing transformations are associated with numerous observable similari- ties between two kinds, the remaining instances of scientifically invalid metamorphoses are locally rationalized with reference to just one or a few points of resemblance. In one respect, Nage belief in the transformation of large land snails into catfish is the most interesting of all. Imported from western Indonesia and introduced into ponds from where it has escaped to nearby rivers and streams, the fish, named ika lele ('lele' is Indonesian for 'catfish'; ika is Nage for 'fish'), has been present in central Flores for only a few years; so the idea is very new. In elucidation, Nage refer to the fact that both the snails and catfish possess 'horns' (the snail's tentacles) and 'moustaches' (the fish's barbels). Perhaps also relevant is the local notion that the catfish has a 'hard head like a gecko'. Be that as it may, the main resemblance Nage adduce in support of the transformation is, curi- ously enough, a reputed similarity of sound. Nage thus asserted that when one grasps a live catfish, there issues from its mouth a noise (transcribed in my notebook as 'chi chi chi' or 'shi shi shi') which bears a remarkable resemblance to the sound made when one steps on a land snail. Although I did not investigate the matter in the field, it seems possible that this trans- formation belief has some basis in speculation about how the fish gets from ponds to other bodies of water. In accordance with its recent appearance, the belief is less widely accepted than comparable ideas. In fact, it appears to be not so much a belief as a hypothesis which has yet to pass fully the test of local experience or to attain as firm a place in the Nage store of knowledge as comparable beliefs. (e) 'Green tree vipers turn into large vipers, larger vipers then turn into rat snakes' (hiku bale mépu, mépu bale sawa). The transformation of green tree vipers (Trimeresurus albolabris) into a larger kind of viper is rejected by some Nage who argue that mépu refers simply to older and larger speci- mens oí hiku. In fact, a zoologically valid empirical link of this sort appears almost certain (see Forth 1995), and would therefore explain the belief as a misinterpretation of two growth stages of the same species as a metamorphosis of one kind into another. The dis- agreement is significant, as it attests to an indigenous distinction between metamorphosis involving different kinds and maturation within a kind. Only a minority of Nage appear convinced of the subsequent transformation of mépu into a large rat snake (sawa, possibly Elaphe subradiata). Although the notion is consistent with the larger size of sawa, its local credibility may be reduced by the fact that, like all vipers, mépu are poisonous whereas rat snakes are not. Once again, then, the disappearance of a feature receives less credence than does its appearance. (f) 'Russell's vipers turn into a kind of eel' (nipa ba bale tuna balo). This transformation specifically refers to newborn snakes that immediately enter bod- ies of water; ones that stay on dry land remain snakes. As Nage comments attest, the belief is based partly in the fact that the Russell's viper (nipa ba\ Vipera russelli), a highly ven- omous and much feared snake, and the eel, a particularly aggressive kind specified as tuna balo, both bite. (Venom is also the focus of a belief linking Russell's viper with a kind of poisonous spider called // 'e séko, described as providing the viper with venom which it squirts directly into the snake's mouth.) General morphological similarities between snakes and eels doubtless play a role as well. In fact, one man - a sceptic - attributed to others a belief whereby snakes in general (nipa) turned into generic eels (tuna). Similarly, a Keo informant reported once having witnessed a snake mating with an eel. The offspring of this 279</page><page sequence="10">On Deer and Dolphins match, he thought, might be either water snakes or offspring, half of which were snakes and half eels. (g) 'Earthworms turn into crayfish' {fa* i hati bale kuza). This transformation specifically concerns large earthworms that emerge in profusion from the ground after the onset of the rainy season and reputedly grow to a width of one centimetre and a length of about 30 cm. The freshwater crayfish that is its product - appar- ently a particular variety which however bears no special name - is said to be distinguished by its short 'legs'. As the only eye witness report I recorded described the metamorphosis as occurring in a swamp, sometimes at least it takes place in watery environments. Although I never heard Nage say so, it may be that the segmented appearance of both worms and crus- taceans also plays a part in the idea. (h) 'A kind of ant turns into thread-waisted wasps' (metu ladhe bale haobete). Also called metu to, 'red ant', the (unidentified) ant kind is supposed to transform into a small reddish wasp which may belong to the family Sphecidae, or thread-waisted wasps, or alternatively to the Tiphiidae.10 Apart from the wasp's relatively small size and the simi- larity of colour, another possible empirical support for the belief is a local report that larger specimens of the ant develop wings. In fact, all species of ants include members which, at a specific life stage, become winged. One should also not lose sight of the fact that, as insects, both wasps and ants undergo actual metamorphosis. Noteworthy in this regard is the para- sitic behaviour of some Sphecid and Tiphiid wasps, which lay their eggs in the nests of other insects, including ants (Linsenmaier 1972:165; Swain 1948:148; Borror, Triplehorn and Johnson 1989:455). Some such wasps also inject eggs into a large insect or spider thus causing it to die. The carcass is then consumed by developing the wasp larvae, and anything that remains may be carved up and carried away by ants (R.C.West pers. comm.). (i) 'Deer turn into dolphins' (kogha bale lobhu). The posited transformation of deer (Cervus timorensis) into dolphins (presumably Prodelphinus malayensis) specifically concerns old male cervines with fully developed antlers that enter the sea in order to escape relentless pursuit by hunters. The only observ- able similarity between the two animals supporting the belief concerns their methods of locomotion. As Nage remark, dolphins leaping from the sea and quickly submerging resem- ble deer bounding through scrub or long grass. Alluding to this behaviour, Nage use 'dol- phin' (lobhu) metaphorically, to describe a person who is always disappearing only sudden- ly to reappear. Exploiting the same imagery, the delightful idiom 'dolphin down on the coast' (lobhu lau ma'u) refers to a man unable to maintain an erection. Otherwise, as high- landers with only occasional access to coastal regions, Nage are generally unfamiliar with cetaceans and seem unaware of their mammalian character. Informants described lobhu as 'deer lacking antlers that inhabit the sea' and as having heads resembling a cow's. Rather than motivating the belief, however, these comparisons are more likely to be derivative. Consistent with a general lack of knowledge about dolphins, the belief, although now well known in Bo'a Wae, appears mostly to reflect a particular historical experience. The following summarizes an account provided by P. Lape Ga'e, an expert hunter: During this century, and especially prior to the nineteen-sixties, the Nage of Bo'a Wae would regularly join the people of Toto, who live near the north coast, in their annual major hunt (Nage to 'a lako). Hunting on coastal hillsides, riders armed with spears and harpoons would drive deer towards the shore, where older animals would often enter the sea. (Younger and smaller animals would not get this far or would manage to flee back to the hills.) Swimming in the sea, some were pursued on horseback and speared. Others were killed from boats by seamen from the 280</page><page sequence="11">Forth coastal settlement of Bai (Mbai) and the island of Palu'e, who by arrangement with Toto and Nage hunters would stand ready with their vessels on the shore. But some animals would escape by disappearing beneath the waves, where they would transform into dolphins. Quite convinced of this metamorphosis, the same informant also stated that after devel- oping full antlers, deer shed these and in their place grow knobbly protuberances resem- bling ginger root. It is then that the animals enter the sea and turn into dolphins. While Nage generally remark that deer lose their antlers on becoming dolphins, this second account reflects a slightly different version of the belief, since deer fleeing from hunters' spears are fully antlered when they enter the sea. How far these representations are connected with direct observation by Nage hunting on the north coast remains unclear, and it would seem quite likely that the belief is based mainly on stories told by Toto people. Either way, it appears that the Nage belief may depend as much on a lack of familiarity with dolphins as on behavioural or morphological features they may be perceived to share with deer. Indeed, a number of informants, includ- ing people whose zoological knowledge was otherwise quite extensive, had only a vague idea of what sort of creature the name lobhu ('dolphin') designated. So far as I could dis- cover, the belief is not encountered in the Keo region, bounded by the south coast of Flores. Keo do occasionally see dolphins at a distance, but they do not hunt deer as none occur in their territory, a circumstance that may be connected with the absence of the belief. (j) Tadpoles turn into frogs' {anafe bale pake) and other zoologically valid metamorphoses. The student of transformation beliefs initially confronts a paradox: creatures that par- ticipate in zoologically valid metamorphoses are on the whole notably more dissimilar in respect of physical form and behaviour than are members of zoologically invalid transfor- mation pairs. At the same time, valid transformations entail the possibility of observing the actual process of metamorphosis. Where Nage and other non-scientific societies so to speak go wrong is in not assimilating observable metamorphoses to ontogenetic development gen- erally, and then identifying scientifically valid with invalid transformations as homogenous instances of a single process labelled bale ('transformation'). From childhood experience of playing in ponds and streams and, Nage are fully aware of the gradual development of frogs (pake) from tadpoles (ana fe), and ultimately from spawn (telo pake). They are similarly able to describe in detail the process whereby the phy- tophagous larva they call teku fèsa infests fésa, a. cultivated bean plant (apparently Phaseolus sp.), and then some months later bores its way out of the thickened vines as a striking, iridescent blue-green and long-legged leaf beetle named gilo - a member of the genus Sagra (R.C. West, pers. comm.; also Borror, Triplehorn and Johnson 1989). Seemingly consistent with such accurate observation, few Nage contradicted widely recog- nized instances of valid metamorphosis such as the transformation of tadpoles into frogs. Only one informant expressed doubt about the transformation of caterpillars (kuku bula) into butterflies (bhèbha or gake). The same man rejected the derivation of flies from mag- gots, which he claimed always remained maggots." While frogs classed as pake are always recognized as transforming into tadpoles, some Nage were similarly uncertain whether larg- er ranids, distinguished as tu gea, did so as well. There are also instances where two species displaying valid metamorphosis are nevertheless incorrectly associated by Nage. Although apparently not a widely held idea, one man stated that a flying insect (kalo; locally described as a sort of flying ant) turned into termites (ghane) while another claimed the reverse.12 Also, whereas Nage say that large grubs called doko transform into cicadas (naju), doko may in fact designate the larvae of a scarab beetle, which sometimes closely resemble cicada nymphs (R.C.West, pers. comm.).13 Obviously, then, not all zoologically valid transformations are consistently recognized as such, either because Nage do not notice 281</page><page sequence="12">On Deer and Dolphins them at all or because immature forms of metamorphosing creatures are incorrectly linked with adults of other kinds. Possibly contributing to local inaccuracies, moreover, names given in Table 1 are likely to be applied to larval forms of more than one species. OBSERVATION AND TRANSFORMATION The cases reviewed above facilitate a more general assessment of the part observation plays in Nage transformation ideas. Referring to the Nuaulu of Seram, Ellen (1993:167) suggests that knowledge of valid zoological transformations may shape and sustain invalid ones. While he is probably right, it is nevertheless clear that neither observation of actual meta- morphoses nor manifest resemblances between paired kinds is sufficient to account for the genesis of particular beliefs. Dwyer, on the other hand, discounts observation as a signifi- cant factor in transformation beliefs, arguing that similarities between natural kinds are selectively adduced in rationalizing pre-existing beliefs (1976:199). Referring to Rofaifo notions, he further attributes individual disbelief in particular metamorphoses to a sceptical attitude rather than to more accurate observation of natural phenomena. Among Nage, the latter point is supported by the fact that scepticism is often rationalized with reference to the same empirical particulars as is conviction. That is, whereas some Nage mentioned morpho- logical and other resemblances as support for a belief, others cited exactly the same resem- blances as causes of a mistaken belief in the same metamorphosis. But while transformation beliefs cannot be attributed solely to observable resemblance, it is equally unlikely that experience of the empirical world plays no part in their maintenance or in determining which animals figure in specific transformations. In the present ethnographic case, diversity of local opinion as to the validity of specific metamorphoses accompanies a marked variation in the epistemological status of different transformation beliefs. Some of course coincide with scientifically valid metamorphoses. Others involve one species that does in fact metamorphose, though into a creature different from what Nage postulate, thus suggesting partial observation of the actual transformation as a major source of the belief. Other metamorphoses draw considerable support not from observation of ontogenic process but from regularly remarked resemblances of appearance, habitat and behaviour between animal kinds that are manifestly similar at virtually all stages of development. Of course in this respect there is considerable difference among several transformation pairs, some (such as flying foxes and civets) manifesting numerous resem- blances while others (such as deer and dolphins) display just one or a few. CULTURAL AND UTILITARIAN FACTORS Since observation alone is insufficient to account for the notion of animal metamorphosis (cf. Bulmer 1968:637, 638) one needs to consider other factors promoting the idea. Possibilities suggested by earlier writers include specific cultural or utilitarian practices and formal and lexical properties of ethnozoological classification. Further possibilities focus on the relation between contemporary zoological transformation and other forms of transfor- mation (see Table 2). A review of evidence bearing on utilitarian or functional explanations for Nage transfor- mation beliefs yields a negative result. Writing on New Guiñean societies, Bulmer (1968; see also Bulmer and Menzies 1972-3:104) suggests that dietary and culinary restrictions may explain transformation beliefs insofar as the beliefs provide ways of circumventing such restrictions. Interestingly, such a use of transformation beliefs is familiar from the European rationalization of eating barnacle geese during Lent, on the ground that the birds grew from barnacles and were therefore not 'flesh nor born of flesh' (Radford and Radford 1961:30; see also Halting 1864:246-52). However, no animal participating in Nage transformations is absolutely or contextually forbidden as food. Several kinds regarded as inedible (but not 282</page><page sequence="13">Forth exactly 'tabooed') - including snails, earthworms and snakes - are moreover the origin of kinds that are edible (catfish, crayfish and eels). In other instances, transformation produces kinds that are less rather than more edible, as when grubs become insects, and deer - the meat of which is highly prized - turn into dolphins, whose flesh is unknown to Nage.14 Also referring to New Guinea, Dwyer (1976:201) suggests transformation beliefs may help explain why game animals, despite the hunter's skill, are not driven to extinction. This interpretation, too, finds no support in the present case. Among Nage, the one animal that is regularly hunted - the deer - is not the product of a transformation, but rather turns into an animal that is not hunted - the dolphin - and furthermore does so when escaping from hunters. In fairness to Dwyer, it should be noted that he himself ultimately rejects the argu- ment as a sufficient explanation of transformation beliefs, as does Ellen (1993), who reach- es similarly negative conclusions in regard to Bulmer's food restriction hypothesis. The fact is that animals figuring in Nage transformation pairs possess little utilitarian or ideological value of any kind. It is therefore difficult to discern cultural factors broadly comparable to ones reviewed by ethnographers of New Guinea, that might motivate them. Perhaps the closest one comes is the belief concerning deer, since this provides Nage with some account of what happens to animals that disappear (and evidently drown) in the sea. Whether beliefs in contemporary animal metamorphoses serve some symbolic function, and are thus comparable with mythical and spiritual representations involving an identical- ly designated notion of transformation (bale), is quite another matter that is best treated separately, after considering with possible connections between transformation ideas and classification. TRANSFORMATION AND ETHNOZOOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION Discussing eight transformation beliefs found among the Kalam of New Guinea, Bulmer argues that half of these are correlated with (though not necessarily caused by) 'faulty' or 'inadequate' taxonomy (1968:637,638). By this he mostly refers to taxa that do not coincide with scientific species, or which reflect differences within species. The approach has been criticized by Dwyer (1976). Being potentially relevant only to beliefs that involve taxa belonging to the same species, Bulmer's argument in any case has little bearing on the majority of Nage transformations. In a somewhat more positive vein, the idea that transformation beliefs may be con- nected with features of ethnozoological classification has more recently been argued by Ellen (1993), who initially states that such beliefs 'might be thought to affect in rather fundamental ways how [a people] classify the relationships between different animal cat- egories' (1993: 163).15 Referring to the Nuaulu of eastern Indonesia, the author however goes on to explain transformation beliefs as developing from taxonomic relations of inclusion, thus treating classificatory form as a precondition rather than a product. Ellen's initial statement, it is worth pointing out, expresses a general position elaborated in a series of publications, according to which ethnobiological classifications are based not on universal principles of taxonomy reflecting natural discontinuities, but on cultural pat- terns constructed of particular experiences of, and beliefs about, the natural world. Nevertheless, in this case it is Nuaulu classification that is supposed to account for ideas about metamorphosis, or 'ontogenetic' relations (1993: 167-9) between different kinds, and not the other way around.16 According to Ellen, Nuaulu transformation beliefs function to confirm or legitimate the classificatory status of natural kinds as central and peripheral members of a single class (1993:170-71). Members of Nage transformation pairs, however, are for the most part not susceptible to this sort of interpretation, simply because their members are not so related. Connected with this, by far the majority of names appearing in Table 1 denote terminal taxa, that is, ones not further divided into named varieties. Possible exceptions that might 283</page><page sequence="14">On Deer and Dolphins appear to fit Ellen's interpretations are the two metamorphoses involving snakes, all of which Nage include in the life-form taxon nipa. As noted, one transformation links hiku and mépu, smaller and larger vipers which Nage sometimes include within a broader category also labelled hiku. Yet associated with this mode of classification is a local view that the two included terms refer to no more than growth stages of a single kind, and that the belief in metamorphosis - ironically for Ellen's interpretation - is mistaken. Also weighing against his approach is the fact that Nage do not distinguish named snake kinds as central or peripheral members of nipa ('snake'), a category which includes only ophidians and excludes, for example, eels (tuna) and worms (see Forth 1995). Whether degrees of periph- erally play any part in transformations linking the three named members of the covert 'bat' class is moot, though it is reasonably certain that the kind called gébu, the middle term of the three-part transformation, is less central than the other two. In a different way, classificatory peripherality could conceivably influence the idea that flying foxes transform into palm civets. The large bats are certainly marginal to the Nage 'bird' category; and as Nage comments suggest, this is largely attributable to the way their heads and faces resemble those of non-birds, including, of course, civets. Partly by losing the one feature that identifies them with other 'birds' - their wings - the large bats might then be described as turning into the kind of non-bird that they most closely resemble, thus removing them from the 'bird' category (expressible as 'winged creatures', ana wa ne'e ta 'a bele) altogether. Yet in this instance it cannot be a classificatory relationship that pro- motes the belief, since flying foxes and civets are members of unequivocally separate life- form classes. Instead, it is a palpable morphological resemblance which peripheralizes one animal within its assigned class while possibly contributing to a belief that the creature may eventually transform into a member of another class. Dolphins are similar to flying foxes in this regard, being highly marginal to the Nage life-form category ika ('fish'); but in this case the metamorphosis would have a peripheral animal as its product rather than its source. As for deer and civets, both are reasonably central - or at any rate not obviously peripher- al - members of quite another category. Nage classify both creatures immediately under 'animals' (ana wa), which, having a focus on larger mammals, and more particularly domestic animals, largely corresponds to the English folk sense of 'animal' (Forth 1995:47). Insofar as one might be able to identify for Nage a covert category of wild mam- mals, kogha (deer) would probably be the most salient instance while bheku (palm civets) would not be the most marginal. Another aspect of Nuaulu folk taxonomy which Ellen considers relevant to beliefs in zoological metamorphosis is a use of kin terms for 'mother' and 'child' in the names of related natural kinds. This sort of nomenclature, he argues, expresses empirical similarity which may be 'elaborated into a belief about ontogeny or origin' (1993:169; see p. 168 where the author similarly speaks of 'semantic shifts') linking kinds subsumed by a single ethnozoological category. Recalling Dwyer's criticism of approaches that derive a 'correc- tive belief from 'faulty taxonomy' (1976:198), this kind of explanation also has no bearing on the Nage case. Unlike Nuaulu and some other Indonesian peoples (see e.g. Taylor 1990), Nage do not in fact use kin terms in naming related kinds. Although the word for 'child', ana, does appear in some Nage zoological names, where it is partly motivated by the rela- tively small size of the kinds designated (see Forth 1996), the term is never taxonomically productive. For example, while tadpoles are called anafe, the element yè does not occur alone with a zoological reference. According to Ellen, language may further encourage Nuaulu transformation ideas where certain beliefs are expressed in statements referring to an animal 'coming' or 'origi- nating' from another kind (1993:168). In fact, one Nuaulu expression of this sort alterna- tively refers to class inclusion, so that in this language 'comes from' can also mean 'is a kind of. The Nage language, however, does not parallel Nuaulu in these respects as Nage do not say that metamorphosed animals 'develop' or 'derive from' (pu 'u ena, more literally 284</page><page sequence="15">Forth 'to have one's origin in, to stem from') their original forms; rather they express the relation- ship as a more specific 'turning into' (bale). In addition, while Nage ways of articulating class inclusion are similarly equivocal to ones employed by Nuaulu, they also do not link taxonomy with derivation but rather with resemblance (Forth 1995:57-9). Resemblance is of course a factor in Nage transformation beliefs. Yet their connection in this case is not crucially mediated by idiomatic language; nor does it imply taxonomic inclusion, as Ellen's argument would seem to suggest. For Nage, like all folk classifiers, empirical resemblance informs definitions of natural kinds generally, but only to a point. This delimitation accounts for a seeming paradox, namely that Nage rationalize transformation beliefs on the basis of resemblance while asserting that members of transformation pairs are different in kind - or, as I argue further below, in essence. In fairness to Ellen, it should be noted that his arguments have greater plausibility in regard to Nuaulu beliefs. Among Nuaulu, natural kinds linked in representations of contem- porary zoological transformation are on the whole far more closely related to one another, both scientifically and in folk classification, than are their Nage counterparts. Thus most comprise pairs of frogs, lizards, turtles, and crabs (Ellen 1993:164-5, s.v. Table 6.2). In con- trast, Nage pairs entail more distant relationships, connecting animals that are more diverse morphologically and environmentally. Yet so too do the Malayan ideas mentioned earlier (see note 2) and ones described by Dwyer for the Rofaifo of New Guinea (1976:201). Dwyer's account indeed demonstrates how Rofaifo beliefs mostly involve kinds belonging to diametrically opposed natural classes. He further shows how transformations tend to proceed in particular directions, with larger animals usually developing from smaller ones, animals inhabiting one environment deriving from ones occupying a decidedly differ- ent environment, abundant creatures transforming into scarce ones, and so on. Nage pairing fit well with Dwyer's generalization, especially as regards size and habitat. All metamor- phosing natural kinds listed in Table 1 are either smaller than the kinds into which they transform or do not differ significantly in size. Environmental contrasts - between land and water, air and land, land and air - are also pronounced in well over half of the cases. Moreover, where land animals (deer, snails, earthworms, and vipers) become aquatic kinds (dolphins, catfish, crayfish, and eels), entering water may be considered to have a catalytic effect - though this is clearly indicated only with regard to young vipers, since specimens that do not take to water explicitly remain vipers. Rather than as bases or by-products of classificatory forms, Dwyer (1976:203) goes on to describe beliefs in animal transformation as an attempt to restore to nature a unity which taxonomy has compromised, without denying the 'universe of multiplicity' that classification recognizes or provides. Thus viewing transformation beliefs as a kind of 'anti-classification' is not without merit. Even so, it fails to explain why this unifying thought operates only on a very small number of local taxa (among Rofaifo, as among Nage, Nuaulu, and Malays). The interpretation also does not address the fact that, in certain instances, only some members of a kind will undergo metamorphosis - a circumstance which, since it suggests that transfor- mation beliefs are strictly speaking not about categories at all, is even more damaging to approaches that treat the beliefs as integral to forms of classification. For these reasons, I find Dwyer's comparison of transformation ideas with modern evolutionary theory (1976:204), an evaluation seconded by Ellen (1993:169), somewhat overdrawn. Unlike evolutionary the- ory, the ideas do not refer to reproductive processes, imagining instead adult members of one kind simply undergoing metamorphosis to become individuals of another kind. In this same regard, transformation beliefs differ from totemic representations accord- ing to which present human groups are mythically derived from animal ancestors or human and animal offspring are born to a common forebear. In at least one way, therefore, evolu- tionism resembles mythical transformations more than it does contemporary zoological metamorphoses. In other respects, however, it is similarities rather than differences between the two sorts of transformations that demand our attention. 285</page><page sequence="16">On Deer and Dolphins MYTHICAL AND REVERSIBLE TRANSFORMATIONS As most contemporary zoological transformations posited by Nage involve pairs of animals differing markedly in form, habitat, and behaviour, they might appear most comparable to metamorphoses described in Nage myths, where humans for example turn into animals, stones, or heavenly bodies, or people derive from plants (see Table 2, Sections I and II). In the same respect, contemporary animal transformations further parallel non-mythical meta- morphoses of a reversible kind (see Table 2, Section IV), as well as the permanent transfor- mation of humans or human souls into witches and birds (See Table 2, Section III). These sorts of ideas, expressed either in stories concerning the beginning of things or representa- tions of current reality, have of course a well nigh universal incidence. By contrast, belief in contemporary zoological transformation has by all indications a rather more restricted occurrence. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to suppose that mythical transformations and the contemporary and reversible shape-shifting proclivities of certain entities - all similarly classified by Nage as instances of bale ('transformation') - may contribute to ideas con- cerning metamorphoses thought regularly to affect different kinds of animals in the present day. Such traditions would then complement observation of nature, and especially of zoo- logically valid transformations, which as shown earlier would seem to play a similarly for- mative role in the Nage belief. When one considers the evidence more closely, however, one is struck by certain onto- logical differences between Nage zoological metamorphoses and the other kinds of trans- formation exemplified in Table 2. First, with the exception of mythical buffalo that develop from maggots infesting a dead snake, none of the other varieties of transformation involve members of one animal kind regularly metamorphosing, either permanently or temporarily, into animals of another kind. Secondly, whether occurring in myth or in the present day, all temporary or reversible transformations are quite explicitly bound up with representations of spiritual beings, and especially with the spirit category nitu (Forth, in press). That is, a spirit in the form of a human, plant, or animal temporarily assumes a very different form before reverting to its original guise (or indeed disappearing altogether). In contrast, none of the contemporary zoological metamorphoses recognized by Nage involves any spiritual component. One needs to be quite clear about this. Like numerous peoples, Nage do indeed link particular animals with spirits. Both snakes and eels are forms ordinarily assumed by nitu spirits, while a number of other wild animals are regarded as their domestic animals. Deer, for example, are considered to be the goats of the nitu, and civets their dogs. As spirit dogs, moreover, civets killed by humans are subject to several culinary restrictions aimed at pre- venting spirit retaliation, while the continuous nocturnal wailing of a civet near a village is taken as an ominous manifestation of spirit malevolence. But despite these associations, most snake taxa as well as the majority of animals conceived as spirit livestock (including wild pigs; giant rats, Papagomys armandvillei; and junglefowl, Gallus varius) do not figure in their transformation beliefs. Nor is the transformation of kinds that are linked with spirits, including civets, in any obvious way attributable to the spiritual association. Deer may be spirit goats, but dolphins are not subject to any kind of spiritual interpretation; nor contrary to what European animal symbolism might suggest, are bats.17 Also contrasting with contemporary zoological metamorphoses, some instances of irre- versible mythical transformation differ in their ideological basis from temporary changes of form (or mythical and contemporary shape-shifting), yet are similarly explained by spiritual connections. For example, the transformation of maggots infesting a snake carcass into numerous water buffalo, in the epic story of Wégu the orphan, is consistent with various associations of buffalo and snakes mediated by a common identification with nitu spirits which, in different contexts, manifest themselves in both animal forms (see Forth, in press). Formally, then, the two animals are connected in the same way as are Nuer twins and birds. 286</page><page sequence="17">Forth In addition, the mythical transformation of the Nage heroine, Pénu Ga'e, first into a large fish, and then into a human female, is predicated on an identification of the fish with a dead spirit and of both with the category nitu. Although spiritual associations are not so obvious in other cases, they are discernible nevertheless. For example, Nage ideas regarding shamanism (Forth 1991) clarify how ancestors described in myth as temporarily assuming the guise of tiny creatures (see Table 2, Sect. II) are exceptional humans who have obtained the powers of free spirits (nitu), including the ability to change shape. Also, while another myth simply proclaims that a mistreated little girl once turned into a forest whistler (kete dhéngi; Pachycephala nudigu- la), the belief that infant souls (mae) and aborted fetuses also assume the form of these rarely seen songbirds strongly suggests that the bird in the story is an embodiment of the lost girl's spirit or soul. Widely encountered in other parts of Indonesia, several myths in which individual humans transform into animals, heavenly bodies, rocks, and food plants have an even less obvious basis in spiritual ideas. Nevertheless, it could be significant that all of these transformations figure as the consequence of some violent action and occasion- ally a killing - acts which among Nage as among other Indonesians are thought to result in a temporary or permanent loss of soul (mae).x% The transformation of deer into dolphins might just be seen as comparable to these mythical metamorphoses insofar as transforming deer are harried by hunters. Although I have never encountered the myth among Nage, this belief is moreover reminiscent of a possibly widespread Indo-Malaysian theme according to which dolphins originated from a mistreated human being (see Skeat 1900:309; Forth 1988:221-2). Yet neither in this nor in any other contemporary zoological transformation is actual violence or killing entailed in the representation. In regard to these mythological instances as well, then, one is evidently dealing with a quite different sort of idea. Underlining the difference is the further circumstance that all of the mythical transforma- tions referred to in Table 2 pertain to individuals and to unique events, and not to regular metamorphoses of different animal kinds. Consistent with all of the foregoing, Nage themselves appear to be quite conscious that bale ('transformation') can contextually refer to quite various things. Once, when checking information on contemporary zoological transformations, I asked a group of Nage whether the mythical transformation of a single human being into a monkey was a possible instance. Their immediate response was that this was a myth ( 'ana nange) and so did not count. I should straightaway add that this characterization of the metamorphosis as mythical did not mean that it is untrue or nonsensical. As further enquiries subsequently confirmed, it merely implied that a man turning into a monkey in the indefinite past is something quite different from present day deer changing into dolphins or bats into civets. In accordance with their consistently non-spiritual ontology, arguably the most crucial factor distinguishing Nage beliefs in contemporary zoological transformation from most other instances of bale is the way the former imply essential (as opposed to mere phenome- nalogical) change. By contrast, representations involving spirits assuming one form later changing into another evidently entail no change of essence between the two visible manifes- tations. Always assuming impermanent guises, spirits remain spirits whatever their outward form. On the other hand, the transformation of ordinary human beings into witches (polo), an entailment of the Nage version of the 'thunder complex' (Forth 1989; Blust 1991), or alter- natively into shamans (toa mali), does imply such a change; for Nage describe both witches and shamans as outwardly indistinguishable yet radically dissimilar in regard to spiritual essence from ordinary humans (Forth 1993). In the same way, I suggest, Nage descriptions of zoological transformation pairs as comprising different 'kinds' (Indonesian 'jenis'), most- ly able to reproduce in their own right, suggests that metamorphosing animals turn into crea- tures that are different in essence and not just simply appearance. The foregoing bears on Atran's thesis (1990), according to which biological tax- onomies everywhere derive from a pan-human recognition of differences of essence 287</page><page sequence="18">On Deer and Dolphins between natural kinds. If deer and dolphins, for example, were not essentially different, and transformation from the former to the latter were predicated on their possession of a com- mon essence, then Nage beliefs would obviously contradict Atran's argument. On the other hand, if metamorphosing deer undergo a change of essence, as the evidence in fact sug- gests, then the thesis is unaffected - just as Nage ethnozoological classification is evidently uninfluenced by such beliefs. It is as unfortunate as it is curious that Atran fails to mention beliefs in contemporary zoological transformation in developing his essentialist theory.19 The closest he comes is his brief reference to counter-intuitive 'mythico-religious beliefs' concerning humans changing themselves into animals and animals into plants as well as 'creatures who [sic] can change themselves at will* (1990:219). Such beliefs, Atran claims, 'dramatically contradict' common-sense knowledge and assumptions about living beings while remaining linked with these 'in a "dialectical" way'. He then further suggests that it is because representations involving radical transformation violate category distinctions and 'basic notions of ontology' that they attract attention and become memorable (Atran 1990:219-220; cf. Boyer 1993, 1994, 1996). Although Atran does not explicitly mention beliefs in members of one animal kind changing into animals of an essentially different kind, one may infer that he would also view such ideas as constituting knowledge of a fundamentally different sort from the ordi- nary practical knowledge implicated in ethnozoological classification.20 Clearly, though, Nage beliefs in contemporary animal transformation cannot be accommodated to Atran's category of 'mythico-religious beliefs'. For as just shown zoological metamorphoses do not entail spiritual beings and in other ways as well contrast sharply with representations expressed in myth. Quite another matter, however, is whether beliefs in contemporary zoo- logical transformation are counter-intuitive, or contradict 'basic beliefs'. An objection might be raised with regard to the scientific validity of some Nage transformation beliefs. Thus while it is easy enough for a western observer to regard as counter-intuitive the meta- morphoses of bats into civets or deer into dolphins, the characterization is less obviously applicable to the transformation of tadpoles into frogs. On the other hand, one should not lose sight of the fact that much modern scientific thought, to which some Nage beliefs inci- dentally correspond, is equally counter-intuitive (see for example Wolpert 1992; Boyer 1993), diverging from common sense to the same degree as notions falling within Atran's 'mythico-religious' category. If beliefs in contemporary animal transformation are neither 'basic' or common-sense beliefs nor mythical or religious ideas, then Atran's binary division obviously requires revi- sion. In the same respect, the notions are also not readily accommodated to Sperber's (1975) similar distinction of 'encyclopaedic' and 'symbolic' knowledge. Of course, from this one cannot infer that such ideas are fully scientific. Yet they might be understood as constituting a sort of proto-science - in a way reminiscent of, but distinct from, Dwyer's comparison of New Guiñean beliefs with modern evolutionary theory. Nage beliefs in con- temporary zoological transformation resemble scientific thought in several ways, and to the same extent differ from their beliefs about spirits. Most notably, while empirical supports for individual metamorphoses are quite various, all posited transformations are based on empirically observable resemblances or natural processes. In addition, unlike visible mani- festations of spirits, which Nage tend to conceive as fortuitous and contingent upon the pro- clivities of individuals, the empirical features Nage adduce in support of contemporary zoo- logical transformations are, in principle at least, available to everyone. Two further similarities with scientific thought may be briefly registered. First, posited animal transformations are accompanied by an attitude of scepticism, and insofar as certain individuals argue strongly against them, they might even be considered susceptible, if not exactly to disproof then to rejection. Implicit in this is a further difference between notions of animal transformation and religious ideas; accordingly, while some Nage strongly deny certain transformations, no one appears to doubt the existence of nitu spirits, souls, or 288</page><page sequence="19">Forth witches. Even more to the point, whereas many Nage disagree that certain snakes can trans- form into snakes of another kind, all seem to agree that a serpentine guise is one regularly assumed by nitu. Secondly, beliefs in contemporary zoological metamorphosis appear to be non-utilitari- an and non-technological - a feature often not immediately associated with modern sci- ence but characteristic nonetheless (see Wolpert 1992). In fact, their only apparent purpose is to attain some measure of understanding of the natural world. In this connection, it is also relevant that Nage beliefs in contemporary zoological transformation are contextually dif- fuse. That is, unlike mythical transformations and a variety of ideas about spiritual beings, their expression is not confined, for example, to traditional narrative, discourse about ritual practice, or pragmatic explanations of disease or other misfortune. It seems consistent with this feature of the Nage beliefs that I encountered them relatively late in my fieldwork. I would further speculate that, for the same reason, imaginative constructs of this sort may often have gone unreported in accounts of other cultures, a circumstance that would explain their rarity in the ethnographic record. CONCLUSIONS Whatever the merits of functionalist explanations for other societies, Nage transformation beliefs are not explicable by reference to utilitarian value. Nor are they implicated to any appreciable extent in features of ethnozoological classification. Beliefs coinciding with zoo- logically valid metamorphoses might be said to entail 'over-classification'; yet a more promi- nent feature is the way they challenge ethnotaxonomy by postulating a quasi-developmental connection between kinds locally as well as scientifically conceived as distantly related. While their common expression with a single term, bale, suggests some sort of concep- tual connection between all Nage representations involving transformation, the main out- come of their comparative analysis is the discovery of a major ontological difference. Most notably, whereas reversible changes of form as well as irreversible instances described in myth are attributable to the operation of otherwise invisible spiritual beings, contemporary zoological transformations reveal no such spiritual basis. From this it can be inferred that beliefs in the irreversible transformation of contemporary animal kinds imply a permanent change of essence. Viewing such change in terms of Atran's distinction (1990) between basic and counter-intuitive beliefs as a point of departure, there is moreover reason to sup- pose that, among Nage (as also among western laymen lacking in scientific education) valid as well as invalid metamorphoses may be apprehended as extraordinary, or fundamentally exceptional, by comparison with what is perceived as a natural norm. In his concluding statement on Rofaifo ideas, Dwyer suggests that one belief (whereby beetle larvae trans- form into butterflies and thence into bats) might be viewed as 'deliberate nonsense encapsu- lated within a greater matrix of transformations beliefs. ..still potentially pragmatic' (1976:204). Implicitly, this assessment turns on the extent to which a posited transformation diverges from common sense. However, if among non-scientific empiricists such as the Nage all such transformations were apprehended as fundamentally contrary to common sense, then of course all would equally be 'nonsense'. At the same time, some transforma- tions, and particularly zoologically valid instances, are, as it were, less easy to avoid than others. Yet once the possibility of transformation is accepted, metamorphoses less grounded in empirical experience may also be entertained. Consistent with these observations is the regularly reported circumstance that some members of societies maintaining transformation beliefs reject them or express doubts about their validity. Nage tend to be more sceptical about zoological transformations which do not find ready support from observation. Yet, with the apparent exception of the transformation of tadpoles into frogs, all contemporary zoological metamorphoses are treated with a degree of scepticism by some Nage.21 Local scepticism further weighs 289</page><page sequence="20">On Deer and Dolphins against a view of transformation beliefs as established items of culture. The hypothetical or provisional character of such ideas is perhaps most apparent in the case of snails turn- ing into catfish, a notion that has developed only recently. Yet while the least stable transformations may be ones that are most lacking in empirical support, it is also possible for beliefs to acquire stability, and thus durability, from non-empirical sources. For example, the metamorphosis of deer into dolphin, having relatively little basis in Nage experience, may largely be sustained by poetic or aesthetic qualities. Recalling Dwyer's characterization of some beliefs being 'potentially pragmatic', one can further envisage particular transformations acquiring some sort of spiritual rationale, thereby becoming assimilated into a cosmology that attributes extraordinary or mysterious occurrences to the actions of spirits. On the whole, though, one is left with the impression that beliefs in contemporary zoological transformation are a special sort of idea sometimes thrown up by human imagination which rarely amount to very much in any culture - unless of course they are themselves transformed to become integral components of either reli- gious or scientific cosmologies. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Research among Nage has been conducted during a series of visits to central Flores begin- ning in 1984. Research in the Bo'a Wae region was sponsored by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), the Indonesian National Institute for Cultural Research (LRKN) and Nusa Cendana University in Kupang. Funding was at various times provided by the British Academy, the Central Research Fund of the University of Alberta and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. I am grateful to all of these bodies for their support. Part of the present essay derives from an earlier paper delivered at the 18th Annual Conference of the Society of Ethnobiology, held in Tucson, Arizona, USA in March 1995. Another version was read to an audience of anthropologists and Southeast Asian specialists at Northern Illinois University in April 1997. At different times, research assistance was provided by Dr. A. K. Molnar (now at Northern Illinois University) and Mr. W. Irlam and Ms. S. Lambertus, both students at the University of Alberta. Information regarding the classification of insects and many helpful suggestions have been provided by Mr. R. C. West, a Research Associate in the Natural History section of the Royal British Columbia Museum, whose assistance I detail in note 8 as well as in the text. While the paper has bene- fitted from help provided by all of the above, responsibility for the analysis and argument must of course remain with the author. NOTES 1 . Preliminary investigations suggest that the Keo beliefs are not so numerous as those recorded among Nage. Possibly exclusive to Keo are ideas concerning the transformation of dhèke {Rattus spp.) into bétu (the Flores giant rat, Papagomys armandvillei), and following one particularly vague report, of sea turtle eggs which, in the informant's words, 'can change into all sorts of things including mice and birds'. In the eastern Nage dis- trict of Réndu I recorded a similar idea, according to which young turtles that hatch facing towards dry land turn into snakes while some of those that enter the sea become eels. 2. According to Malays, a type offish develops from a monkey; tigers and monitor lizards derive from crocodile hatchlings that turn towards the dry land; another kind of fish transforms into a sea-bird; and tadpoles undergo a bifurcate metamorphosis, with the head becoming a frog, and the tail a fish (Skeat 1900:187, 286, 289, 307, 309, 310). Ambiguous cases, where Skeat's phrasing does not clarify whether he describes contemporary or mythical transformations, include the development of squirrels from a large caterpillar, a fish from a frog or lizard, a mollusc from a mouse, and another kind offish from a cat ( 1 900: 1 90, 191, 192, 307, 308). 3. Several colleagues who have worked in various parts of eastern Indonesia, including Flores, inform me that they have not encountered beliefs in animal transformation in their research areas. 4. Variants of bale with the same or similar senses are bali and bhale (see polo bhale, 'to turn, be turned into a witch', Forth 1989:99; and bhale tebo, 'replacing the body', the name of a curing rite). All forms should be compared with Indonesian (Malay) 'balik', meaning inter alia 'to turn back, return, turn over'. 290</page><page sequence="21">Forth 5. Although Ellen employs a similar Table in his monograph on Nuaulu (1993:164-5), he does not incorporate the distinction of temporary and permanent transformation. 6. Somewhat problematic in this connection are ipu, a kind of fish fry. Some Nage seem to know that these are the immature form of a riverine fish they call ana tebhu; but I am not sure that this development is not some- times expressed with bale. 7. I also recorded this idea among the Keo. Although in several contexts ule refers to several kinds of larvae, when used without a modifier the term usually denotes a maggot. Uleja and ule bhada refer to maggots asso- ciated with flies that infest horses and buffalo respectively. However, I was told that these, together with other maggots, specifiable as ule mo [or mou], all belong to a single kind. In contrast, ule holo designates a separate larval kind which does damage to maize plants (holo), and is thus comparable to ule_gu. 8. These various identifications are based on information kindly provided by Mr. R. C. West employing pho- tographs I took in the field. 9. Whether this idea has any empirical basis is unclear. Bats do have tails, but these are surrounded by mem- brane; and what Nage refer to here is evidently a protruding tail. An interesting comparison is the Nage belief that extremely old humans, as well, grow short tails (an idea I also recorded in eastern Sumba). 10. It is not clear whether ladhe has any other sense relevant to its use in naming this kind of ant (metu). As regards hao bete, the first element denotes a whispering or rustling noise and is evidently onomatopoeic, while bete was said to denote a thin stick of wood. Interestingly, for the closely related Ngadha language, Arndt ( 1961 :587) glosses xaco, which is cognate with hao, as 'a kind of black ant' (schwarze Ameisenart). 1 1 . Other divergent opinions included that of another man who claimed that only 'hairless' green and brown cater- pillars transformed into butterflies while large hairy varieties, which he identified exclusively with the name kuku bula, did not. The transforming kind, he thought, might be called miku_kumi, a term that denotes a chrysalis or cocoon. Another informant suggested that large butterflies (gake) developed from miku kumi and not from kuku bula. 12. These ideas may relate to an identification of kalo with the alate form of offspring of termite queens, and thus to a scientifically valid metamorphosis. 13. The matter is actually more complicated than this. As indicated in Table 1, scarab beetles {moco) are transfor- mations of larvae called togi. However, as accords with the similarity between cicada nymphs and scarab lar- vae noted above, one informant claimed that doko and togi were synonymous. 14. In the northeastern Nage district of Réndu I was told that some people will not eat eels because they resemble snakes; hence this association, too, obviously has quite the opposite effect from that posited by Bulmer for New Guiñean beliefs. (See also Skeat's report, 1900:306-07, that many Malays refuse to eat kinds of fish which they regard as having originated from a cat.) In the realm of mythical transformations, it may further be noted that the derivation of a monkey from a human being does not prevent Nage from consuming monkey flesh. Nor does the emergence of buffalo from the carcass of an inedible snake, or from maggots, affect their appetite for buffalo meat. 15. The discussion is contained in a section of Ellen's monograph on Nuaulu ethnozoology, which repeats without alteration a paper published in 1985. 16. Ellen's use of 'ontogeny' and 'ontogenetic' is questionable. Whereas ontogeny refers to development of indi- vidual organisms from birth to maturity, the beliefs he addresses, like their Nage counterparts, entail a radical transformation from one kind of organism to another. 1 7. Almost ironically, bats are not even particularly associated with witches, even though the latter are similarly nocturnal and capable of flight. In the more general regard, Nage would appear to be quite different from the Kalam, since Bulmer (1968:638) characterizes all transforming kinds posited by this New Guiñean people as possessing some sort of 'mystical' significance. 1 8. Themes of victimization and physical attack occur in a number of eastern Indonesian myths where transforma- tion follows an irreversible separation of protagonists consequent upon the delivery of a severe beating. In addition to Nage and other eastern Indonesian myths describing a human turning into a monkey (Forth 1988), examples include the mythical derivation of the dugong from a woman savagely beaten or otherwise mistreat- ed by her husband (see Forth 1988; also Knappert 1995:68, regarding a variant from the Manus of the Admiralty Islands). Several eastern Indonesian myths concerning the transformation of an incestuous sibling pair into stars - usually the Pleiades and Antares - similarly involve physical injury or a beating, as do myths from Flores, Sumba, Savu and Roti describing the derivation of water buffalo from mistreated humans(see Arndt 1932:48 regarding the Ngadha of Flores; Kreemer 1956:220-21 for other eastern Indonesian islands). Malay mythology, as well, includes numerous stories in which transformation into animals results from beat- ings, quarrels, fright or shock (Skeat 1900:122, 123, 126, 158 ff, 185 ff, 201; see also Endicott 1970:78). 19. Of the several published discussions of this topic, Atran cites only Dwyer's 1976 paper, but even then he does not refer to it in connection with animal metamorphosis. It is similarly surprising that Berlin, in his major work on ethnobiological classification (1992), also makes no mention of transformation beliefs. 291</page><page sequence="22">On Deer and Dolphins 20. Both Atran and Boyer draw support for this distinction from psychological studies showing how a common- sense knowledge based on a naive theory of essences is already present in young children. In experimental situ- ations, children thus tend to reject the possibility of members of one living kind transforming, by way of a mod- ification of external appearance, into another kind (Gelman and Markham 1986). As Boyer (1993:36) points out, however, adults eventually develop counter-intuitive ways of thinking that contradict this basic common sense. Religious thought is one example; but modern science is another (Boyer 1993; see also Wolpert 1992). Employing a different sort of evidence - Ovid's Metamorphoses and Grimm's Fairy Tales - Kelly and Keil (1985, see also Keil 1986) similarly demonstrate how the likely occurrence of a transformation decreases as the ontological distance between the categories to which members of the transformation pairs belong increases (407), even in contexts involving a 'willing suspension of disbelief (403). While these studies are plainly rele- vant to the tonic at hand, thev raise more issues than can oossiblv be treated in the present essav. 21. In regard to the apparently universal acceptance of tadpole metamorphosis, we should not ignore the possible influence of schooling. Although Nage generally describe learning about the metamorphosis as young children at play, the topic is also covered in school lessons; so it is quite possible that modern education has reinforced belief in scientifically valid metamorphoses while discouraging others. At the same time, it is important to note that disbelief is not clearly correlated with either level of education or age. In fact, two of my most scepti- cal informants in Bo'a Wae were men in their sixties with a minimal education. REFERENCES ARNDT, P. 1932. Die megalithenkultur der Nad'a (Flores).
