Gebauer, who worked among the Mambila in 1936-50, provided only sketchy and minimal notes for many of his photographs. All of his photos are archived in The Robert Gold- water Library, Paul Gebauer Collection, and The Photograph Study Collection, The Metro- politan Museum of Art, New York. -I, I o o o o c 9 m v, o -n I m r m 9 o -I, o p z r c v, m c r o -n p 9 Sculptures of the Mambila of Cam- eroon and Nigeria are well known, having been included in large touring exhibitions and illustrat- ed in catalogues (e.g., Thompson &amp; Vogel 1990, Northern 1984, R.E Thompson 1974, Preston 1985). Yet there is very little infor- mation available about the Mambila and the social system that forms the context for the production of these objects. In- deed, the catalogues all quote the same two sources for the names, uses, or mean- ings of the sculptures: Paul Gebauer and Gilbert Schneider, both American mis- sionaries who were interested in art and anthropology. They were the first mis- sionaries to work for any length of time in the Mambila area--Gebauer in 1936-50, Schneider primarily in 1947-52.1 Until I began my fieldwork among Mambila in Cameroon in 1985, the only anthropolo- gist to have worked with the group was Farnham Rehfisch, who spent a year in the village of Warwar in 1953-54. My research on Mambila religion and society (Zeitlyn 1987, 1990ab, 1991, 1992, forthcoming) has led me to examine the sculptures in Western collections and to attempt to relate them to my fieldwork. This essay sets out to analyze the uses and significance of some of the figurines called tadep and kike. These carvings are mainly anthropomorphic, although there are some animal figures. Discussion of tadep and kike leads to a consideration of masquerades of the association called siaga, and their accompaniment such as tawoa flutes with carved mouthpieces. Siadga lies at the heart of Mambila reli- gion, and a later section considers how it might best be approached. The Mambila The Mambila are found on either side of the border between Nigeria and Cam- eroon, the majority living on the Mambila Plateau in Nigeria.2 A smaller number (approximately 12,000) live in Cameroon, especially at the foot of the Mambila Plateau escarpment on the Tikar Plain. My fieldwork (1985-92) was restricted to these latter groups, and in particular to the village of Somid (population approxi- mately 1,000, according to the 1986 tax census). Self-sufficient in food produc- 38 african arts * autumn 1994</page><page sequence="2">tion, the villagers have grown coffee as a cash crop since the early 1960s. Cameroonian Mambila society closely resembles that of the Mambila in Nigeria, as described for the Nigerian village of Warwar by Rehfisch (1972). However, Nigerian Mambila did not have the same type of institutionalized chiefship found in Cameroon. Villages in Nigeria were or- ganized on gerontocratic principles and largely lacked political offices. The of- fice of chief was principally a ritual one. In Cameroon elements of the chiefship found among the neighboring Tikar3 were adopted in precolonial times, lending political authority to the Mambila institu- tion. Most villagers in Cameroon are Mus- lim or members of either the Catholic or Protestant church. Despite this, much of the indigenous religion remains. Little is known of Mambila history. Based on his research in Warwar village in 1953-54, Rehfisch wrote: The Mambila have no origin myths. Much time was spent enquiring into the origin of the tribe, all to no avail....Some of my informants said that comparatively recently, perhaps about a hundred years ago, some of the Mambila groups now on the plateau had emigrated from the lowlands in what is today the French Cameroons. The villages from which they came were located near settlements occupied today by Mambila-speaking peoples. (Rehfisch 1972:10) In contemporary Cameroon, Mambila say that they come from the highlands, on the Mambila Plateau. The last wave of Mambila appears to have arrived on the Tikar Plain in the last half of the nine- teenth century (see Zeitlyn 1992). Tadep and Kike Although both Gebauer and Schneider made major collections of Mambila arti- facts, their publications do not provide much detail about the uses to which these objects were put or the belief system with- in which they were used (see Gebauer 1964, 1979; also Gebauer 1968, 1971a; Schneider 1992).4 In this regard Gebauer has stated, "The Gebauers did not ever reside among Mambila and do not have any certain answers to these questions" (1979:333). Nevertheless, both he and Schneider had the considerable advantage of being in the field before the Mambila Plateau was emptied of sculpture by art traders, apparently during the 1960s and 1970s. This is not to say that everything to do with Mambila religion as it existed circa 1940-50 has disappeared, but it seems to be true of the small, collectable statuary. Masquerades are still performed in contemporary Cameroon, although those I have seen lack carved headpieces. Of all Mambila figurines, only tadep and kike have been widely collected and hence are well documented. Tadep (Figs. 1-3) are usually male-female pairs, carved of low-density wood (silk-cotton tree: PHOTO: COURTESY OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART PHOTO COURTESY OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART Left: 2.

Photograph by Paul Gebauer, 13/43. Ceiba pentandra). Kike (Fig. 4) are carved and pegged figurines made from the pith of the raffia palm (often called bamboo in the literature).5 These statues, which I will discuss further below, and other figurines representing animals were stored in gra- naries (illustrated in Gebauer 1979:51, bot- tom; Schneider 1955:116). Other sorts of statues were kept on display outside the granaries, which sometimes had paintings on the exterior walls (Tong 1967:9). Both Gebauer and Schneider use the term "ancestor figure" to describe these figurines. I would suggest, however, that the association of these objects with "ancestor cults" rests on the false assump- tion that all groups in the region have such cults. Rehfisch did not find one in Warwar, nor did Viviane Baeke in the village of Lus among the Wuli,6 nor did I in Somie among Cameroonian Mambila.7 It is un- likely that an ancestor cult, along with its shrines and the sculptures, could have vanished so completely that no traces have been discovered by my research. It is possible that the objects did not belong to ancestor cults but were the sacra of associations concerned with illness and healing, as is the case in Lus, according to Baeke. This theory would account for the similarity between the granary-like store- houses and terracotta figures among the Mambila and those described and illus- trated by Baeke (1984, 1985) among the Wuli. It also has the merit of explaining how the associations could vanish so com- pletely, since healing societies are notori- ously vulnerable to fashion.8 As I shall demonstrate below, most tadep and kike were part of the s'aiga complex, which (in Somie at least) has replaced healing asso- ciations and become central to the tradi- tional religion. Su'aga' has, however, also become simplified. Many of the ritual paraphernalia such as the statuary are no longer in use. Yet the essentials seem to have remained unchanged, maintained by a continuity of ritual practice. Important evidence for the connec- tion between the figurines and s'aaga is contained in field notes9 made by Gilbert Schneider during a return visit to the Mambila area in 1959-60. These notes make it clear that we must distinguish szuga storehouses from those of healing associations. The tadep, kike, and painted screens called baltu were only found on nggoblo so ("store sa% aga%"). Schneider documented three healing associations, called Cugli, Leli, and Kuli. Each had its own storehouses, which were undecorated and much smaller than ordi- nary granaries and sulaga storehouses. Little is known of these associations. Leli is connected with illnesses of the stomach (li). According to Schneider's notes, in- duction into one of the three (Cugli?) in- cluded the bloodless killing of a goat (it was beaten to death); the animal's blood was then spilled into one of the dished stones set on pillars that both Gebauer and Schneider have photographed stand- ing in compounds near studga storehouses (e.g., Schneider's photograph in Schwartz 1972:25, fig. 12 foreground). The picture that emerges from the available, mainly photographic, docu- mentation shows that the sacra of the saaga masquerades were kept in granary- like storehouses, described below. The sacra of other curing rites that are only 40 african arts * autumn 1994</page><page sequence="4">loosely connected to suaga masquerades, if they are connected at all, were kept in sim- ilar structures. These consisted of a plat- form about 1.5 meters high, supported by four vertical forked tree trunks, upon which sat a structure with a steeply pitched thatch roof. The larger storehous- es appear to have had square bodies, the smaller ones round bodies (Fig. 5). The outer wall of the larger storehouse was made from lengths of palm rib. In front of one face was the baltu screen, made of raf- fia pith and decorated with paint. Typically two figures were painted on it with a rainbow above them. In front of the baltu was a net in which objects-dead birds, chicken heads, feathers, and some- times figures-were placed. Their pur- pose is unknown. Small figures were usu- ally attached to the storehouse structure or suspended in front of the screen (Figs. 6, 7). Mambila granaries often have fire- places on the ground below the platform so that smoke can rise into the stored grain and help preserve it. Ritual store- houses usually had fireplaces near them rather than under them, and other types of objects, such as pots or painted stones were placed below. Schneider has a pho- tograph of two pots painted with large round eyes, placed one on top of the other beneath a si'iaga storehouse. A string con- nects the pots to the floor above (Fig. 8). Mambila domestic cookery takes place inside houses on three firebricks, or some- times two firebricks placed near a wall which acts as the third support. These ovoid mud bricks, decorated with small finger-made indentations, are made by married women. Ritual cooking, however, takes place outside and on firestones, not bricks. The Mambila word for hearth or fireplace is kb. Ko ld (lit., "hearth treat- ment") is the term for ritual fireplaces. Ko is also used metonymically for firebrick or firestone, so ko id could refer to a fireplace used to prepare treatments, or to one of its firestones. Different treatments have their own fireplaces; therefore a man who knows and prepares several different treat- ments will have several fireplaces in his compound. Gebauer's and Schneider's photographs show that this has been the case for at least the last fifty years. The s'iaga' storehouse contained masks and suits as well as pottery and wood fig- urines, gourd megaphones, and trumpets (Fig. 9). "Medicines" were kept there as well. In his field notes Schneider men- tioned that the ndip so (sulaga? storehouse) belonging to Lel of Mbamnga village contained medicine for rain and "for those killed by lightning, so the matter would end." The figurines are of several different sorts. The type that is easiest to distin- guish is kike (kiki has also been recorded), a simple anthropomorphic figure made from three pieces of raffia pith pegged (and sometimes tied) together. Extra pieces were added to make arms and male genitalia. They were usually made in male and female pairs and decorated with red, white, and black paint. Other figures were carved from a sin- gle piece of wood (usually) or pith (rarely). Tadep (tadup, tadip, tatschop have also been recorded) were commonly made in male-female pairs, but in the photographs they also appear as singles, or as multiples of one sex, more often than do kike. Approximately 30 centime- Below: 8. Two clay pots called mvui, with paint- ed eyes. The pots are connected by twine to the floor of the storehouse above. Warwar vil- lage, Nigeria, n.d. (ca. 1950?).

Commonly the left hand clasps the chin, while in other cases both hands are raised to the chin. Similar gestures are to be seen in carvings from the Cameroon Grasslands and on carved doorposts among the Bamileke consider- ably to the south of Mambila." Both the kike and tadep so far described were placed at the bottom of the baltu screen or in the net in front of it. Since the si~ga storehouses were in the compound and not fenced off in any way, these fig- ures were visible to both women and chil- dren. Rehfisch noted that in Mbamnga, but not Warwar, what he calls tatschop fig- ures were placed in granaries (field notes, Nov. 1, 1953). Judging from Rehfisch's unpublished photographs, these appear to be tadep. Other carved wood figures are larger but stylistically very similar to the tadep. However, these were kept inside the storehouses, out of the sight of women. It thus seems plausible to assume that they had a ritual significance or use different from that of the small tadep outside. Gebauer and Schneider also called these larger figures, which they collected, tadep. It is possible that Mambila did not lin- guistically distinguish between the two sorts of wooden figurine, even though they are functionally distinct. Or perhaps there was a qualifying term that went unrecorded; for example, tadep dua12 (by analogy with the nomenclature for the si~ag masquerades, this means "big tadep") could have referred to the larger figures found inside the storehouses. Or finally, perhaps a completely different name existed that went unrecorded. One note in particular is important for the light it throws both on this point and on the putative identity of the tadep as ancestor figures. In his field notes 10. Stone figure located in a family compound near several ritual storehouses. Approx. 75cm- 90cm (30"-36") above the ground. Mambila Pla- teau, Nigeria. 1960. Schneider wrote that the "long-headed tadep is called ndeng like the long-headed juju, and the stubbier tadep is called b3 like the juju figure." The black fiber suits that masqueraders wear without a head- piece were called suiga ndeng. The name b3 has not been recorded in the context of masquerades. To sum up, the figures are found only on storehouses for suaga objects, and there is some evidence for identifying the tadep figurines with suaga' masquerades. There is no evidence for an association with Mambila ancestors apart from the repeat- ed use by both Gebauer and Schneider of the term "ancestor figure" when provid- ing documentation for their collections. Other Figures In addition to the tadep and kike, other figurines of Mambila manufacture have been documented. There are, for exam- ple, children's toys consisting of paired figures (approx. 8 cm high), threaded on strings, which slide together in imitation of the sexual act. These are considered highly amusing by adolescent onlookers. Those I have seen in Somid were made by Nigerians but are identical to those from Ngambe Tikar, far to the east, which date from 1912 or before (illustrat- ed in Thorbecke 1914-24). Stone sculptures are known to exist, but little can be said about them. Pierre Harter makes reference to, but does not illustrate, Mambila granite figures (Harter 1986:322, 326, 337). The only documented example was photographed in the field by Gilbert Schneider in 1960 (Fig. 10). Carved by the compound head, it stood exposed for all to see. It was located near several ritual storehouses, including one for saidga, and special fireplaces for pre- paring different "medicines." In his field notes Schneider observes only that the sculpture overlooked the rest of the com- pound and that the carver had wanted to make a male figure as well but had been prohibited, for unspecified reasons, by his father. No clue is given as to the object's name, use, or significance. Animal figurines, made from wood or pith, and some of terracotta, were collect- ed by Schneider: carvings of dogs, snakes, and hippos have been observed.13 These were hung beneath ritual storehouses. Schneider describes them as "protective" or "totemistic." Gebauer collected some small terracotta figures (one now in the Portland Art Museum, another in Gebau- er's personal collection) which have a human-like torso with a head resembling that of the suaga' masks (Fig. 11). These were used in palm groves when wine was being made. It is unclear whether the figures were intended to prevent theft or to ensure that the wine-making went smoothly and good wine was produced.

In February 1961 two informants in Mbamnga told him that they were used to guard palm-wine groves; thieves were held to become impotent or sterile if they stole wine pro- tected by a mantab. The owners of such fig- ures were believed to have other powers, such as the ability to transform themselves into leopards (a power usually attributed to witches). A mantab was often buried after the death of its owner, although it was possible, after a sacrifice, to transfer it to a new owner. In 1961 similar figures were still being made, but these were called nki since they lacked the holes into which "medicine" could be placed. Today Cameroonian Mambila have a variety of anti-theft devices called sigo that are attached to such objects as fruit trees. They differ in the plants used to make them and in the effects they are believed to have on any would-be thief. Most that I have observed include knot- ted pieces of grass. In these cases two pieces of grass are doubled up so that a growing tip is at either end, alongside the roots of the other piece. A knot is tied in each end. I have seen no figurines used to prevent theft. Apart from the protective figures mentioned above, other terracottas are of human figures which were kept in- side ritual storehouses. Four in particu- lar appear to be by the same sculptor, Marami of Mbamnga village (Fig. 12). He made the pair of male figures that was collected by Schneider and is now in the Milwaukee Public Museum (nos. 21591-60593, 21591-60594); and he ap- pears (on stylistic grounds) to have made both the broken figure that was collect- ed in the Donga Valley in 1937 by Gebauer and is now in the Portland Art Museum (no. 70.10.45) and the female figure now in a private collection (see Preston 1985:62, no. 58).14 Gebauer's notes on his broken figure are as follows: The maker of this object is un- known. Its last owner admitted to its usage by his ancestors in cir- cumcision rites. He himself kept the figure in his personal storage. Appreciating the perfect heart- shaped face he made it the proto- type of all his sculptures in clay, terracotta and wood. (Gebauer 1979:219) Calling them "special Mambila ancestral figurines," Schneider provides this de- scription of the male pair:15 These two pieces are always kept within the house itself. These are not shown to women in Mambila. They are kept within the ancestral hut, not on the outside. Many of the other male terracottas, the pith fig- ures, the wooden tadeps and kikes are all kept on the outside of the ancestral house. These two are always kept on the inside and women are not allowed to see them. They are also not labeled by any particular Mambila man's name. Mention should also be made of ter- racotta vases decorated with faces like those found on tadep sculptures and, in at least one example (Northern 1984: fig. 131), sz'iaga masks. These appear to be of relatively recent origin, but are nonethe- less authentically Mambila. Their distri- bution is concentrated in the Gembu- Dembe area.16 It is possible that such vases were used to serve guinea corn beer on special (ritual) occasions. Vases (called bigo) are used by Mambila in Cameroon today. Those meant for every- day purposes, such as carrying beer to work parties in the fields, have a single straight neck, while those used for cere- monies have a double or triple neck but are not specially decorated. Distribution It is clear that among the southwestern Mambila, Mbamnga village was a reli- gious center.17 It enjoys a reputation as such until this day. When Gebauer and Schneider were in the field (1940-60) it would appear that Mbamnga was a center for the production of such ritual objects as pottery figures and sa'ga masks. In con- versation with me Schneider has com- mented that in the late 1940s there were ritual storehouses in more compounds in Mbamnga than in Warwar. It remains an open question whether the groups to the north of the Donga River got their ritual paraphernalia from Mbamnga or whether carvers were active elsewhere; the latter seems more likely.

PHOTO: JEAN HURAULT is surprising considering the relative inde- pendence of Mambila settlements in most other respects (the main exception being the iron trade). However, independence should not be mistaken for isolation.18 An Overview of Shiga The ritual paraphernalia of the sui'iga com- plex comprises not only the carved wood and pith figurines already discussed, but also wood masks and fiber costumes which were kept in the sui'iga storehouses. I shall now discuss the concept of sui~ga and how the masks function within it. Su~iga is a unitary concept but with two main foci: the masquerades and the "oaths," a blanket term I use to cover a range of related rituals in which the actors swear their innocence. Some of these rites form an important part of dispute resolu- tion.19 The power of the su'a'gi oath is rein- forced, at least in part, by the imagery of the sh'aga? masquerade. Mambila explicitly state that there is linguistic and conceptu- al unity between the two. Neither the masquerades nor the oaths should be seen as the primary or dominant form.20 The masks considered here operate in ritual contexts, but elements of play are evi- dent, especially when they promenade through the village terrorizing members of the other sex. Hereafter, I follow Tonkin's conventions (1979a, 1979b), using "Mask" (with capitalization) to denote the ensem- ble of actor, costume, and "mask" (carved face piece). Each masquerade (that is, the events at which the Mask is used) has a dif- ferent dance associated with it,21 and one can talk of performing men's si'digi even if no Mask appears and only the dance occurs, as happens during funeral sdagS. I can describe women's shaga, the women's masquerade, only in the broad- est terms. My knowledge consists, in the main, of those parts of the rites that men are allowed to see. These include pro- ceedings that they normally do not watch because the activities are shame- ful to male eyes: they involve the women mocking men and the sexual act.22 Mambila say the rites are important for women's fertility, and they also seem to function as an expression of women's solidarity in opposition to men. The Mask itself, worn by a woman, appears to be an inchoate assemblage of leaves and rags without a carved headpiece. Similarly, men's siugi, the male mas- querade, promotes male fertility and sol- idarity in opposition to women, but the latter aspect is less pronounced than in women's suiigS. Men's s&amp;lgt is in princi- ple an annual occurrence, although the dancing and all-night ritual are not, in fact, performed every year. When the main rites, which include the initiation of youths into siag&amp;, do not take place, only the ritual component called "bury- ing the village," which protects it against witchcraft, will be performed. Women's suaga takes place every two years and begins with a rite called "burying the vil- lage." This is also performed in the years between their main rites. Siiaga Masks The costume of the men's sihgi Mask takes the form of a knitted suit, worn with or without a carved headpiece (Fig. 13). The Mask is active in the rites early on the main day of men's shugi (Figs. 14-16). Toward the conclusion of the rites proper, all the young boys in the vil- lage are brought into the su'agi enclosure and treated with a small dab of river mud. As they leave the enclosure they are "attacked" by the Mask, who terrifies them until they cry. Later the Mask parades through the village accompa- nied by groups of men, some of whom may blow whistles (notch flutes), make noises through gourd megaphones (kirim), or shake bundles of gongs.23 They bang on roofs and scatter firewood while women and children hide inside the houses. In Nigeria the performance of men's sh'aiga' is closely associated with wrestling, in which young men attempt to win renown by throwing a succession of opponents. The fights are carefully controlled by senior men to ensure that they do not get out of hand. Different su'gt suits and headpieces have different names (Fig. 17). Some vil- lages have several masks, each con- trolled by a group within the s'Igh asso- ciation that shares its name. Initiation into each group is separate. Once a man has been initiated into shaga, he can join one of the groups and acquire the right to wear the suit. Initiation into a group always involves being shown a set of leaves that is then eaten with a chicken. The initiate provides the live chicken and must, holding wings and legs in his hands, roast it until it is dead.24 Two principal names for si'g? masks have been recorded by Gebauer and Schneider: su'a'ga due and su'adga bur. A Mask is given the same name as the mask being worn. Some of the suits are also named.25 Tong (1967:8) describes the Masks as being ranked, with s'uaga' bur ranking higher than sagai due. However, my informants in Somie said that su'a'ga due was the most important. This is con- sistent with the meaning of the names: due means "wide," or more generally "big"; bur means "dog" (bor in Somie" dialect). The suggestion of rank seems to me to overformalize the differences (see Zeitlyn 1993c). What is certain is that there were several Masks, of which at least two (su'a'ga bur and si'adga due) had prominent horizontally aligned, theri- omorphic helmet-masks with protruding eyes. In general form they resemble masks found among the Mumuye and the Chamba (ills. in Wittmer &amp; Arnett 1978:92; Rubin 1985:98-99).

Rehfisch recorded nyaba as the name of a Mask he saw at a funeral on November 12, 1953. Leprosy was said to affect the wearer of the suit if it got rained on, but Rehfisch could elicit no explana- tion for this. Whenever the Masks of men's suz'ga' emerge, they are accompanied by men whooping, screaming, and playing a variety of instruments. Notch flutes called tog, photographed by Rehfisch, Gebauer, and Schneider,26 are still in use in Cameroon. The photographs also show the use of tawoa, "trumpets,"27 which are actually transversely blown flutes with raised mouthpieces (Figs. 18, 19). Gebauer photographed one being played while held at an angle of ap- proximately 45 degrees, pointed at the ground, an unusual position for flute- playing (Fig. 19). The mouthpiece ends have carved animal heads, often with long open jaws, thus resembling sui'aga' masks themselves. According to Rehfisch (pers. com.), tawry were only played in pairs, the two players walking in cir- cles around one another. Yet he photo- graphed the flutes being played by three young boys with two newly carved tadep statues in front of them. It was his under- standing that the figurines were to be placed in a granary. Sii~ga Oaths Most sui'aga' oaths involve the killing of a chicken. Unlike other African sacri- fices28 these oaths are not directed at a deity, but they invoke powerful conse- quences-illness or death-for those who break them. In the normal ritual practice of both masquerade and oath- PHOTO COURTESY OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART 46 african arts * autumn 1994</page><page sequence="10">PHOTO COURTESY OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART taking, Mambila make no explicit con- nection between the sta'ga masquerades and the oaths. Initiation into a masquer- ade society is a necessary but not a suf- ficient condition for learning to officiate at an oath-taking.29 The most important type of sudhga' oath, and that to which the word "stiagg'" most commonly refers, is performed at the chief's palace to conclude the hearing of a dispute (Fig. 20).30 It takes the form of a set of addresses to a bundle of leaves (part of the "medicine" and held to have special properties) and to a chicken placed over them and subsequently beheaded (Fig. 21). It is clearly the same rite as that which Meek calls Ngub Sho in the first published account of the Ni- gerian Mambila (1931b:552-53).31 The ad- dresses pledge the innocence of the speaker and threaten any malefactor with death. Rehfisch (1969:309) noted similar oath-taking in Warwar but did not record a name. A derivative, private form of the suaga-oath may be taken at home to pro- tect the household against witchcraft. It is often taken when a new house has been built, and it complements another optional rite performed by the five senior women, the gambge, or marenjo, who are chosen from among the sisters of the chief. The marenjo can "bury" a house to hide it from malefactors, in a 20. A dispute is heard on the verandah of the chief's palace. The chief is in the chair on the dais.

Somi6 village, Cameroon, April 14, 1988. manner similar to their annual "bury- ing" of the village. There are three s'aga--oaths that do not involve a ritual killing of a chicken. I have already described kulu sztaiga' and li suzaiga (Zeitlyn 1990b:59-6032). The third, damad, is very similar to two other non- suzaiga rites: the rite of pouring of beer onto a father's grave, and the lom rite.33 Both of these include invocations similar to that made in damad, but without the reference to si4aga that occurs during dama. During the dama rite, the villagers gather in the square outside the palace. The chief sits on his stool; the others remove their shoes and sit or squat in a circle on the ground. The seating choice made by each individual results in a rough segregation between the sexes. When everyone has assembled, the chief nominates a speaker, either one of his sister's sons or a senior sister. The speak- er stands in the middle of the circle, faces east, and raises his or her right forefin- ger, as does everyone else. During the invocation (typically two or three min- utes in length and spoken at great speed) some varieties of good and evil are enu- merated. The main thrust is that good things should enter the village and bad things should pass into the bush. More- over, dama threatens evildoers with sudlga. The speaker says, for example: "If someone comes to the village with evil intent, what will they see?" The vil- lagers, dipping their forefingers to the ground, respond: "They will see sut'aga'." This is identical to the behavior of the audience when the refrain of the main suaga-oath is pronounced. The complex of meanings encompassed within sdlga' formed the context within which the Mambila used the masks and figurines. The carved headpieces and the masquerade rituals provided the power- ful imagery that underlay the force of the ritual oaths. Although the figurines and carved headpieces may have vanished from contemporary Mambila society,34 the symbolic system that produced them retains its vitality. The depredations of art collectors may have reduced the available stock of objects, but they have not greatly affected Mambila ways of seeing the world and human relation- ships within it. [O Notes, page 94 african arts * autumn 1994 47</page><page sequence="11">ZEITLYN: Notes, from page 47 [This article was accepted for publication in May 1992.1 The field research on which this study is based was funded by the United Kingdom E.S.R.C. (grant no. A00428424416) and by a scholarship from Trinity College, University of Cambridge. My research in Cameroon could not have been conducted without the research permits granted by His Excellency the Minister for Higher Education and Scientific Research (R.P 13/85 and 62/86), and the help provided by his staff. Further research was carried out during the tenure of a Junior Research Fellowship at Wolfson College, University of Oxford. Both Wolfson College and the Faculty of Geography and Anthropology, University of Oxford, have been generous with assistance toward the costs of fieldwork. This paper, which was submitted to African Arts in May 1991, has resulted from a study, funded by the British Academy, of the Mambila collections in American museums in August 1990. A previous draft was read by Jeremy Coote, and I have benefited from the care and attention he gave the text. Any remaining infelicities are my own. 1. In addition to occupying the Warwar mission station on the Mambila Plateau for those five years, Schneider subsequently conducted some research in Mbamnga and Warwar villages in 1959-60. Gebauer was in Cameroon between 1931 and 1961. The first anthropological description of the Mambila was published by Meek (1931). This is an important source of now historical information on the Mambila. I have prepared an elec- tronic version of Meek's chapter that incorporates Rehfisch's marginal comments made in 1953. This can be found on the World Wide Web server of the Radcliffe Science Library in Oxford (the URL is http://rsl.ox.ac.uk/isca/meek/meek- intro.html). 2. A note on the name "Mambila": In Cameroon the group officially called Mambila call themselves B5 BA (The BA) and speak Jii BA. In Nigeria the group officially called Mambilla live on the Mambila Plateau and call themselves Nor b5 (The people). Since most of my fieldwork has been conducted in Cameroon I have adopted the Cameroonian convention and use Mambila throughout. 3. I am referring to the Tikar living on the Tikar Plain in the area surrounding towns such as Bankim and Ngambe Tikar (on the other side of the Mbam River). These ate very differ- ent from the groups in the Grasslands whose royal families trace a Tikar descent. 4. Curiously, although he met Rehfisch in the field, Gebauer never cited his work. Schneider provided the information published in Schwartz 1972 and Tong 1967. 5. However, in 1993 a senior informant in Mbamnga described these figures too as tadep, using kike to refer to similarly con- structed birdscares. 6. The Wuli village of Lus is located just across the Donga River from the Mambila Plateau. The population of this area, often called Mfumte in the early literature, has many affini- ties with the Mambila. 7. Mambila ancestor cults, including their beliefs and ritual practices concerning the dead, are discussed in Zeitlyn 1991. 8. I have in mind the literature on witchcraft-eradication cults (e.g., Douglas 1963, Richards 1935, Vansina 1952). 9. Schneider has published very little, and he very kindly made his field notes available to me. The Milwaukee Public Museum has some transcripts of taped conversations with Schneider that were made when the museum purchased his Mambila collection. 10. In Somi6 dialect the term equivalent to nggob is be, which means a particular type of storage hut used to house different types of things such as be yulu (store guinea-corn), be Ia (store treatments), and be sidga (store sz&amp;gtO). 11. Examples are illustrated in the photographic collection archived in the Pitt Rivers Museum (AL 82A, no. 17; AL82B, no. 6). Others appear in Northern's The Art of Cameroon (1984), such as the door frame from Bandeng now in Chicago's Field Museum (p. 79) and a Bamum beaded fig- ure (p. 99). 12. Schneider mentions tadep dua (Milwaukee Public Museum, The Gilbert Schneider Collection, tape transcript, p. 3) but is referring to the statuary on the outside of the store- house. He gives little other information. 13. The examples collected are now in the Milwaukee Public Museum: accn. nos. 21591-60573-77 and 21591-60587. 14. Sadly this figure lacks arms, and no other female figures of its type have been documented. One wonders if any female fig- ures were shown masturbating like some of the pottery males. 15. Milwaukee Public Museum, The Gilbert Schneider Collection, tape transcript, June 8/9, 1967, p. 6. 16. Michael O'Brien photographed a very similar vessel on the Mambila Plateau in 1964. (This has been archived in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, and is to be published in the forthcoming Barbier-Mueller book on Nigerian art [1018-17].) Examples are in the collections of Barbier-Mueller, the Des Moines Art Center, and the Honolulu Academy of Arts. 17. As Warwar, with its large mission and mission hospital, is now. 18. See Warnier (1985:145) for a discussion of regional trade. 19. They may result from accusations of theft or adultery, or from the suspicion of witchcraft (see Zeitlyn forthcoming and 1993b). A digitized transcript from an adultery accusation is available using World Wide Web at http://rsl.ox.ac.uk/isca/mambila/mambi- la.html or using gopher at rsl.ox.ac.uk within the anthropolo- gy corner. 20. Ray and Shaw (1987) have discussed the range of embod- iments (their term) of the spirit Omabe in an Igbo masquer- ade. They argue that the masquerade itself is one among a number of embodiments, and that the other forms are in no sense secondary or derivative (although of less interest to art historians). This is also true of szagti. 21. For an early photograph of a rehearsal of the dance of men's s&amp;g?tg see Gebauer 1979:33 (bottom). 22. In this respect it resembles the descriptions of women using their "power to pollute" among groups to the south. However, unlike the Kom Anlu (see Ritzenthaler 1960) or those described in Ardener (1975), women's sadgti is rou- tinized. It is very much a "ritual of rebellion" in which the obscene behavior only occurs at the sanctioned time. 23. The use of these was documented by Rehfisch at a funer- al in Warwar in the early 1950s. 24. This manner of cooking marks "ritual chickens" in a wide range of contexts from "everyday" chickens. 25. At least five sorts of suits are known in Cameroon. Hurault recorded the names in 1954 as swaba, gamva, and mbom (Fig. 17). To this list sdaga bur and nyaba must be added. 26. See, for example, Gebauer Photo Reel 252, no. 256 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and Schneider photo 60578 in the Milwaukee Public Museum. 27. Rehfisch calls the instruments tang. 28. They are described, for example, in five volumes of Syst~mes de Pensde en Afrique Noire (vols. 2-6), 1976-83. 29. I was initiated into the masquerade society, but have not learned to officiate at the oaths. I am assured that the two sets of leaves used (one for masquerade society initiation and the other for oath-taking) are distinct. 30. Its role in dispute resolution provides a connection between sl~t&amp;gti oaths and Mambila divination (see Zeitlyn 1987, 1990a, 1993a). 31. Meek also describes double clapperless bells being used in oath-taking among Nigerian Mambila. This is known but not practiced by Cameroonian Mambila. 32. This publication is a revised version of my 1990 Ph.D. the- sis, University of Cambridge. The dissertation is about to be published by Dietrich Reimer Verlag (Zeitlyn forthcoming). 33. Lom is now defunct, so data about it is hearsay. I suspect that it was a witchcraft-eradication cult. 34. Increasing numbers of Mambila are predominantly Muslim or Christian. Both the shift in religious allegiance-and the effects of the trade in international art must have had effects on the contemporary state of affairs. I suspect that fewer Mambila train as carvers because of religious affiliation or education (the two are often related). Hence figurines lost to trade have not been replaced.
