<plain_text><page sequence="1">Off the Beaten Track: 2007 Italian-Indonesian Archaeological Investigations at Gua Made (East Java) by FlORELLA RlSPOLI Introduction The field work of the 'Italian Archaeological Project to Indonesia (IAPI)' (x) began in 2007 with the excavation of a unique monumental site in the eastern province of the island of Java, some 50 km southwest of the well-known port city of Surabaya. The region, for which the Brantas river acts as the main economic and trade axis, was the focal point of three ancient kingdoms, the succession of which is conventionally taken to mark the history of East Java: Kadiri (1049-1222 A.D.), Singhasari (1222-1292 A.D.), and Majapahit (1292-c. 1527 A.D.). The latter reign was dominant over the entire East Java and extended its influence over the whole Indonesian archipelago. For more than two centuries it brought economic, cultural and political prosperity to the region, until the conclusion of the slow but relentless Islamic expansion, which was closely followed by the aggression of the European colonial powers. Off the Beaten Track The archaeological site of Gua Made (7?247.3" S; 112?19I5.7M E), in the vicinity of the village of Made (Jombang Regency, Kudu-Made District, East Java Province), is situated on a narrow low-lying plain between two watercourses running North of Bantras, the Kali Kromang and the Kali Marmoyo (Figs. 1-2). The site is currently covered by replanted teak and mahogany trees associated with low bush and tobacco fields. (*) I should like to gratefully recall that the project was funded by the General Direction for the Promotion of Cultural Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by the Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsIAO) and by a private sponsor, the Hettabretz Company. I would like to thank Dr Vincent C. Pigott (UCL-UK) who provided helpful comments on the draft of the manuscript and helped me shaping the English version of this paper.

(Picture taken from 400 m in h.). Although lying only 18 km as the crow flies from Trovulan, the focal point of the Kingdom of Majapahit (1292-c. 1527 A.D.), the zone lying North of the Brantas where the hypogeal architectural remains forming the subject of our research were found, has so far been only sporadically subjected to archaeological investigation. The entire region lying between the southern bank of the Lamongan bank and the northern bank of the Brantas River may be considered as 'off the beaten track' as far as its archaeology is concerned. It was always deemed 'peripherar to the focus of power and the economy of the eastern Javanese kingdoms. However, a hill in the vicinity of Gua Made is the origin of a famous inscription - the 'hone of Calcutta' or 'Calcutta inscription', thus called because it was transferred to India at the beginning of the 19th century and placed in the Indian Museum in Calcutta - attributed to King Airlangga (r. 1019-1042 A.D.) and dated by de Casparis to 1041 A.D. (de Casparis 1975: 39-40). Only recently (May and August 2006), did the archaeological research team of the Bureau of Archaeological Conservation of East Java carry out a limited inspection of the area of Gua Made, where it identified at least four sites characterized by the presence of natural springs associated with piles of bricks, probably ascribable to ritual pools (Tim BP3 JATIM 2006a: 23-24; 2006b: 43-44). [3]</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3 - Gua Made, Operation 2. Layer 1: the metallic mask in association with decaying tobacco leaves. Therefore the unique and complex hypogeal structure discovered at Gua Made may be considered the first significant evidence of Majapahit period monumental architecture in the region North of Brant as. Previous Interventions and Genesis of the Project Before describing the results of our excavation activities at Gua Made let us briefly review the steps leading up to this project. Our research began after a series of previous interventions, some of which as we shall see were not dictated solely by scientific interest and were carried out by unauthorized excavators, while others were performed under the auspices of the Balai Pelestarian Peninggalan Purbakala Jawa Timur (Bureau for the Archaeological Conserva? tion of East Java). The attention of archaeologists towards the site of Gua Made was attracted by the results of research by an Italian businessman who, between 1997 and 2000, following the traces of unique 'bronze' masks on the Bali antiques market (Fig. 3) had discovered their origin in an East Java location, namely Gua Made. Here, unauthorized diggers, randomly raiding hypogeal structures, later described as 'profound rooms of an ancient temple carved out of the tufaceous rock', had discovered these unique masks (Fig. 9 b). During the same years, in Italy, this connoisseur met a wealthy collector who loved tribal art and possessed bronze masks of the provenance of which he was unaware and which were subsequently identified as being of the same type as those found at Gua Made. The interest displayed by these two persons in the works of art in question persuaded the archaeologists from the Bureau of Archaeological Conservation of East Java to perform three small sondages in 2001 and 2006 (Wiston 2001; Tim BP3 JATIM 2006a, 2006b). The 2001 sondage, of only 6 days' duration, led to the almost complete emptying of a long underground area (defined as a 'corridor') accessed through one of the various quadrangular hypogeal areas - the so-called 'rooms', that hereafter we shall call shafts - previously raided by unauthorized diggers (Fig. 4). In 2006 work continued on emptying the corridor which was found to be connected to another shaft, Shaft 4. The original brick roofing covering the latter was also 340 [4]</page><page sequence="5">discovered and left in situ (Fig. 5). In attempting to enter Shaft 4 (S4), instead of removing the brick roof covering in a controlled and reversible fashion it was rashly decided to open a narrow passage on the side of the roofing, cutting obliquely through the natural sandstone layer. After entering Shaft 4, the excavators began to remove the deposit inside the shaft and the corridor until they came across a fifth structure (Fig. 6). Here the excavation work ran into serious difficulty due both to the lack of ventilation in the hypogeal room, which was also partially Fig. 4 - The 'hut' protecting Shaft 3. invaded by the mud produced by percolating and perhaps aquifer water, as well as to the instability of the roof bricks supported by the highly friable natural rock walls. ^^^^^^^ Fig. 5 - Shaft 4 with the original brick roofing; at its back the narrow entrance to the shaft cut (2006) obliquely through the natural sandstone layer. [5] 341</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 6 - The entrance to Corridor 5 showing the brick corbelled vault. Partly in order to overcome the problem of the lack of air, but above all to reach the so-called 'room' 5 - that is the long corridor (C5) dug out of the sandstone - the excavators decided to open up a passage about 6-7 metres from Shaft 4. However, after coming up against the natural rock bed and having cut into it to a depth of about one metre without achieving anything, luckily it was decided to suspend the exploration (Fig. 7). Therefore, prior to our intervention, the sondages (2001 and 2006) had involved a hypogeal corridor and a series of 4 shafts (SI, 2, 3, 4), three of which already despoiled by raiders, where several of the unusual 'bronze' masks mentioned above had been found, in association with other artefacts, including Chinese wares and coins. When these data were submitted to us, although we excluded the probability that it could be a mysterious underground temple, it was immediately apparent that we were dealing with a unique structure as no documentary evidence existed in Indonesian archaeological literature referring to hypogeal architectures of the room and corridor type with corbelled vaults and corbelled ceiling and also excavated to such a depth (c. 7 m below ground level) (Fig. 8). It was also immediately apparent that the general layout of the structure still remained to be clarified and that no reasonable hypothesis yet existed as to the function of the monument, the process by which the entire archaeological site had formed or to the chronology of the structure and the artefacts contained in it, including the unusual masks. In 2007, therefore, mainly to find answers to these questions, with the approval of the responsible Indonesian authorities, a first excavation campaign was begun at Gua Made under the auspices of Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsIAO) in collaboration with the National Museum of Oriental Art 'Giuseppe Tucci'. The 2007IAPI Archaeological Campaign At the time of our first inspection, Shafts 1 and 2 (SI and 2) plundered by unauthorized diggers in the late 1990s, appeared as two shapeless ditches filled with accumulated detritus from the monsoons and thus lacking any possible stratigraphic 342 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 7 - View of the artificial pit excavated (2006) to reach Corridor 5, showing the archaeological deposit stratigraphy and the natural rock.

Shaft 3, which between 2001 and 2006 had had its brick roofing removed, was instead protected by a kind of 'hut', which had shielded it from debris, just like also the corrugated aluminium sheets efficiently used to protect the excavation area of Shaft 4. [7] 343</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 9 - Shafts 1 and 2 before (a and c) and after (b and d) our 'clean-up' operations at the beginning of the 2007 excavation season. Initially, our intervention focused on the recovery of Shafts 1-2, both in order to observe their internal stratigraphy and to render access safer, thus allowing the topographers to survey its structure and its position relative to the general layout of the monument (Fig. 9). In addition to these 'clean-up' operations, two main areas of intervention were selected: the first, denoted as Operation 1, covering a total area of 96 sq. m, in the northern zone of the plainland, the second, denoted as Operation 2 measuring 25 sq. m, was located to the south of the plundered Shafts 1 and 2 (Fig. 10). Operation 1 In Operation 1 examination of the sections uncovered by the trench dug in 2006 to expose Shaft 4 allowed a first stratigraphic interpretation to be made. It was [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 10 - General map of the site showing Op. 1 and Op. 2 location. observed that the entire thickness of the archaeological deposit lay over a bed of rock. More precisely, it seemed to be contained by what we later identified as a large artificial bed cut in the bedrock (coarse tufaceous sandstone) (Figs. 11-12). In order to appreciate the stratigraphic and functional relation between the visible cut in the bedrock, the levels of archaeological material contained in it and Shaft 4 cut out of the base plane of the bed, as well as to understand if and how the situation visible for Shaft 4 was linked to the other shafts, a start was made on the stratigraphic survey of the filling inside the ditch which led to the identification of 6 principal layers (Fig. 13): Layer 1 - relatively thick (c. 50-60 cm) consisting of arable soil and/or filling, rich in humus. [9] 345</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 11 - Gua Made, Operation 1. The arrows point the walls of the artificial bed neatly cut into the coarse tufaceous sandstone. Fig. 12 - Gua Made, Operation 1.

The stratigraphic section showing the profile of the main layers. Layers 2 and 3 - characterized by soil with a sandy-clayey matrix with clearly visible sandstone nodules. The potsherds contained in it are relatively large, mixed with smaller fragments of glazed ceramic material and imported porcelain (from Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese kilns) and fragments of animal bones, mostly herbivorous in some cases bearing clear marks of butchering. These two very similar layers make up the largest portion of the ditch filling. Layer 4 - the loamy-sand matrix and fine and medium lamellar aggregation represent the abandonment of the structure, showing traces of seasonal rainwater run-off. The micro-levels formed by tiny fragments of broken down bricks present [11] 347</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 14 - Gua Made, Operation 1. Shaft 6 with the two side benches. in the matrix are evidence of the appreciable degradation of the roofs of the structures, now probably abandoned. Layer 5 - directly overlying Layer 6 (bedrock) and characterized by a matrix having a fine and medium lumpy aggregation structure containing only very small quantities of anthropic material (tiny porcelain fragments). The layer was produced by the breakdown of the sandstone bed due to the run? off/stagnation of seasonal rainwater at a time in which the structures were probably still in use. Layer 6 - sterile, corresponding to the bedrock, coarse tufaceous sandstone. Geologically speaking, the layer belongs to the recent Middle Pleistocene formations (0.781 to 0.126 million years ago) (2). In the northwest corner of the ditch the entrance to a sixth shaft (S6) was found, cut out of the bedrock. At a depth of 1.20 m from the entrance the east and west walls form two side benches (c. 15 cm wide) on the north-south axis, which were probably used to set the bricks of a corbelled ceiling (Fig. 14). Lying exactly at the base of the North wall of the trench, it was possible to expose only a part of the shaft (0.9 m wide at the entrance along the east-west axis and about 1.10 m deep in the excavated portion on the north-south axis), the filling of which was examined down to a depth of c. 4.50 m. At this level three rectangular bricks lying flat on the east-west axis were found, probably collapsed from the ceiling (Fig. 15). Although the investigation was suspended as the excavation campaign had terminated, it may be asserted that the shaft is connected to the corridor C5, investigated in 2006. The location of S6 at the base of the north wall of the long trench was indeed a fortunate coincidence. In fact, the stratigraphy of the archaeological deposit was here associated with the geological stratigraphy of the site as seen in the ditch cut and in Shaft 6 at its base. This circumstance provided us with a relatively clear view of the geological formation of the area investigated: at c. 3.50-3.80 m from the surface, the (2) The area we are interested in, also denoted as the 'Northern Belt', consists in the Rembang anticline (Java)-Madura comprising two massive calcareous formations separated by a lower formation of grey calcareous clays and marls - that is, the upper portion of the Paucangan Formation (Early Pleistocene, 1.8 to 0.781 million years ago) - covered in places by alluvial sediments (coarse tufaceous sandstone or Kabuh Formation) of the Middle Pleistocene (0.781 to 0.126 million years ago). 348 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 15 - Gua Made, Operation 1.

This sequence complies with the lithological profile of the region, situated exactly in the area in which two distinct East Javan macro-regions meet: The one consisting of consolidated carbonate sediments (limestone and marl) and that of unconsolidated recent fluvial and lacustrine sediments (sandstone). In Operation 1, therefore, on the basis of the stratigraphy and the artifacts found during the excavation, the development phases of the structure emerge quite clearly: Phase 1 saw the cutting of the bedrock in order to construct the ditch (Fig. 16), the excavation of the shafts and the connecting corridors as well as the building of the roofs in the period lying between the 13th and the 14th century A.D. Phase 2 coincides with the abandonment of the structure. The micro-levels of layer 4 comprising the breakdown of the bricks bear witness to this. Lastly, Phase 3 represents the various successive episodes of the filling of the 'ditch' after the structure had lost its original function and the area continued to be [13] 349</page><page sequence="14">m[^B^L^b^Bb5Bb^b^b^b^b^B^f^ b^b^b^^bm^b^b^mbT^' ^^^^^y '^^^^^n^h^^^^h^^^'' '^p^p [^^BfrP^ ^ f;rf* ^J8hBb^b^bBb^b^&amp; , Jdi? b^b^bBR.j"' - if ' 'I^bHBHIL^BHb^bBB Fig. 16 - Gua Made, Operation 1.

This phase may be dated to the 14th century. Operation 2 The second excavation area was located south of the plundered shafts S1-S2 on the assumption that other struc? tures of the same type were present that had not been affected by unauthorized excavations. This was decided on the basis of the orientation and average distance between the shafts and the connecting corridors observed at the beginning of our excavation campaign (Fig. 10). In this second area, denoted as Op. "^^^^^^^^^^B " ^^^^^ LAYER fr* bedrock Fig. 17 - Gua Made Operation 2. Drawing of the South wall showing the stratigraphic relation of layers and features. 2, stratigraphic excavation led to the identification of five archaeological levels (Fig. 17): Layer 1 - varying in thickness from c. 40 to 60 cm, it is made up of arable soil. In this highly disturbed surface layer, in association with decomposing tobacco leaves a metal mask was found in a very poor state of conservation and obviously impossible to link to any reliable archaeological context. Layer 2 - with a clayey-sandy matrix, it represents the vertisolization phase of layer 3 due to the increased organic contribution coming from the upper pedological horizon. Layer 3 - characterized by a clayey-sandy matrix rich in sandstone nodules and ceramic fragments of considerable size mixed with much smaller fragments of glazed ceramics and imported porcelain, comparable to the types found in Op. 1, and to animal bone fragments. At least two deep waste pits had been cut out of this layer (Features # 1 and 2). Layers 2 and 3 closely resemble the filling layers found in Op. 1, which had also been cut by waste shafts. Layer 4 - consists of a thick bed of clayey soil (probably marl), which is essentially sterile and has a horizontal stratification. From the top of this layer several waste pits have been dug (Features # 3 and 4), while at its base a large section of brick roofing belonging to a hypogeal architectural structure was found (Corridor 0). Layer 5 - consists of natural rock, sandstone, which forms the pediment of the entire plain area (cf. n. 2). [15] 351</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 18 - Gua Made, Operation 2. Lateral (E-W) and zenithal views of Corridor 0 corbelled brick roofing. The brick roofing section (c. 2.60 m long and 1.40/1.50 m wide) discovered in the southern half of Op. 2 is evidently part of a corridor (denoted as C0) that, in all likelihood, linked Shaft 1 to the north with a room that may be assumed to lie south of Op. 2. The fabric of this artifact (Fig. 18) - covered by a layer (c. 10-15 cm thick) of artificially compacted marl-like soil - is made up of 4 overlapping rows of clay bricks fired at a low temperature, varying in size between 45 x 20 x 10 and 41 x 20 x 10 cm, the first row of which placed on a ledge cut out of the top of the underlying sandstone bed. This section of roofing seems to proceed beyond the southern boundary of the excavation square, while to the north it is placed on the artificial cut made in the sandstone bed. Overall, the various phases of the construction and use of this portion of the structure do not differ substantially from what was found in the case of the portion discovered in Op. 1, except in a few details: Phase 1, dating to the 13th-14th century, is represented by the cut through the marl bed and into the underlying sandstone to make Corridor 0 and to lay the brick roofing (Fig. 18). 352 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Phase 2, dated to the 14th century, represents the abandonment of the hypogeal structure which probably took place at the same time or slightly before the excavation of the waste pits cut from the top of layer 4 (Fig. 17, Feat. # 4). Phase 3 is characterized by several waste pits (Fig. 17, Feat. # 2) and may be dated, on the strength of the imported ceramic material found in it, to the late 14th century. Conclusions The dates provided here were inferred on the basis of preliminary observations of a typological nature on finds, in particular ceramic fragments, often glazed, and imported porcelain (Fig. 19) - made during the 2007 stratigraphic excavation as well as several of those excavated in 2006 that we were able to inspect thanks to the Bureau of Archaeological Conservation of East Java. The top portion of the archaeological deposit (Layer 1) - both in Op. 1 and in Op. 2 - yielded common red burnished pottery datable to the Majapahit period (c. 13th-14th centuries), as well as numer? ous fragments of glazed pottery and exported porcelain produced in Central and South China kilns (Provinces of Fujian and Guangdong) in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) and in the early Yuan Dynasty (c. 15th century) (Fig. 19a-f). The ceramic fragments from Layers 2-3 in both Op. 1 and Op. 2 - that is, Fig. 19 - Diagnostic shards excavated in Op. 1 and Op. 2: a. local red burnished pottery of Majapahit period (c. 13th-15th century); b. fragment of Song dynasty period porcelain with qingbai glaze, possibly from Jianxi province; c. -d. fragment of Northern Song period celadon ware, possibly from Zhejian or Fujian province; e.-f. fragment of a Yuan Dynasty period porcelain bottle with iron oxide 'spots' in the glaze, possibly from Jingdezhen (Jiangxi prov.) the layers of filling in the ditch in the first case and the layers covering the Corridor 0 in the second case - may be dated to between the 13 th and the 14th centuries (late Southern Song Dynasty-Yuan Dynasty) and are typical of the production from the South China kilns and, in the case of the porcelain fragments with qingbai glaze, of the Province of Jiangxi, and in particular those of Jingdezhen (V.A. 1985: 14). [17] 353</page><page sequence="18">A more serious problem is the dating of the filling of the shafts and corridors. Although our opinion is based on the, albeit non exhaustive, inspection of the artefacts excavated in the preceding years, several chronological inconsistencies clearly emerge from an analysis of the inspected materials. The filling of Shafts 3 and 4 and the connecting corridors yielded, for example, a red-burnished water ewer (kendi) datable to the Majapahit period (13th-14th centuries), a Vietnamese blue glazed lid with a lion shaped handle (15th century) (Tim BP3 JATIM 2006a: 33; Stevenson &amp; Guy 1997), and a truncated-conical bowl with thickened rim made from white porcelain clay covered with a yellowish-ivory glaze which stops well above the low and narrow footring. This bowl belongs to a well known and long lived type which was produced by many kilns in southern China and widely exported in large quantities to Southeast Asia from at least the end of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) right up to the 14th century (Tim BP3 JATIM 2006a: 31; V.A. 1985: 2, 11). Also the small cylindrical porcelain box with pale greyish buff glaze with the lid missing, also found in the 2006 excavation, belongs to the category of products imported from the kilns of southeastern China, probably from the province of Guangdong, in all likelihood datable to between the Southern Song Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty era, that is to say between the late 12th and the 14th century. Moreover, in 2006, several Chinese copper/bronze coins (8 intact and 7 fragmentary) were found (Tim BP3 JATIM 2006a: 32; 2006b: 67). The coins found, especially when 'foreign', are usually a sure sign of long-distance trade; we know that starting from the 10th century huge quantities of Chinese copper/bronze coins were imported into Indonesia - above all from the coastal provinces of southeastern China - and were in wide circulation, to the extent of replacing the local silver coinage: in around the mid 14th century so many Chinese coins were in circulation that the Javanese court officially recognized their validity for paying taxes (Trigangga 2006; Christie 1996). This was not an isolated phenomenon. The same thing happened in roughly the same centuries in Korea, as was demonstrated (in 1976) by the finding of 26.775 kg of Chinese coins, mostly of the Song era, in a cargo vessel that sank off the South Korean coast (Wang 2000: 229). The low reliability of these artifacts for dating purposes is obvious, particularly as many Chinese coins from different periods were included in family heirlooms (pusaka) and were handed down from generation to generation. It is no coincidence that the coins found in 2006 at Gua Made may be dated to between the 10th-11th century, such as the 'Huang Song Tong Bao' coin (Northern Song Dynasty), and the 15th-16th century, that is, over a time span of about 5 centuries, which is too long to allow satisfactory dating of the architectural structures. Comparison of the data from the excavation of the two deposits subsequent to the construction of the structures (IAPI 2007 excavations) and of the artifacts found in them (2001 and 2006 excavations) thus seem to point to a dating of around the 13th 14th century for the structures, midway between the end of the Singhasari period and the beginning of the following Majapahit period, while the presence of artifacts dating to at least one or two centuries later might indicate the reuse of the structures in the 15th-16th centuries. The upper deposit, that is, the layers filling the ditch in Op. 1 and 354 [18]</page><page sequence="19">that covered Corridor 0 in Op. 2, albeit only on preliminary analysis, should actually date to between the 13 th and the 14th century, at least one hundred years earlier than the date attributed to the lid with its zoomorphic handle and blue glaze of Vietnamese provenance and several of the copper/bronze Chinese coins found inside the structure. As far as the unique masks depicting faces and the anthropomorphic heads in the round found in 2001 and 2006 are concerned, we have so far been unable to come up with a definitive proposal for their date and cultural attribution, and also their function is problematic. These are indeed unique artefacts, hitherto not documented in other Indonesian archaeological sites, which may be distinguished by their highly diversified typology and type of alloy. The latter, according to an internal report of the Bureau for the Archaeological Conservation of East Java (Tim BP3 JATIM 2006b: 39) is composed by copper, zinc, tin and lead. The gritty appearance of the masks should be a consequence of the oxidation process of the metal, which naturally bounded with the sand produced by the erosion of sandstone out of which the shafts and the corridor were cut. I must confess that when I saw the photos of these objects for the first time I thought they must have been fakes and my impression did not change when I was able to touch them and observe them close up: they seemed to be objects dreamed up by some ingenious local counterfeiter to defraud the antiquities market. My initial opinion changed, at least partly, during a survey in the fields nearby the site. Sparse fragments of the same metal as that used for the masks could be found spread on the surface and over an area of several hectares. It would be strange for counterfeiters to go to the trouble of scattering so many fragments over such a large area, thus contriving by this ingenious plan to validate the authenticity of these works. The only mask found during the 2007 IAPI project excavations was however discovered in a clearly insignificant stratigraphic context (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, what we were able to learn about the circumstances of the 2001 and 2006 finds, as well as from the stratigraphic observations carried out in 2007, and on the basis of the laws of association, the masks may be said: 1. to have been contained in the structure without any apparent preferential dislocation: they were actually found both in the shafts and in the connecting corridors; 2. the artefacts found in the shaft and corridor filling - such as imported porcelain and locally manufactured pottery - are evidence, as we have seen, that the structure was used in the 13th-14th centuries, between the Singhasari period and the following Majapahit period. The masks must therefore have been contemporary with or later than the building of the structure and therefore contemporary with or later than the artefacts associated with it in the filling of the underground spaces, and certainly not earlier than the 13th century. While the genuine nature and perhaps the function of these singular masks will presumably be ascertained by means of future scientifically controlled stratigraphic excavations, conversely the scientific significance of the hypogeal architectural structure of Gua Made is quite clear and may without contradiction be defined as monumental: [19] 355</page><page sequence="20">&lt;^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^B J^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B * JflL^L^L^^^L^L^I?o^'j^t^^1 -1 ^^b^b^b^b^L^HB* ^L^L^L^L^L^I '^????????????????????B ' BB^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^BY - 'Jfl^B^B^B^B^B^Bt^B^B^B^H B^B^BT IB^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^BM v^B^B^B^B^Bk^^H I^^^^^^H f ak?Bi^t^B#^?^^^^P F^Hftf Shaft 6 Corridor 0 '^9^BRS^ Fig. 20 - Longitudinal section of the underground structures showing shafts (1-6) and corridors.</page><page sequence="21">suffice it say that to consider the com? plexity of the overall layout, the difficult of breaking into the large 'ditch', which at least so far seems simply to have been a device to facilitate the positioning and digging of the shafts and the corridors. It should also be considered that work of this kind must have demanded a decision making process that an entire community had to share. As far as can be ascertained today, one should consider this underground construction as a public work over 60 metres long, subdivided into 5 deep shafts, each with brick roofing, and long connecting corridors, at least 2 of which were provided with a brick vault (Fig. 20). The layout was clearly determined by )^^^^^^^^/ Fig. 21 - Gua Made general plan showing the excavation trenches at the end of the 2007 season with the shafts, Corridor 0 and the ditch. the geological stratification of the Gua Made 'hilT which, in the area investigated, was formed by sedimentary lithological horizons of clayey marl (3) and coarse tufaceous sandstone ascribable to the period between the Early and the Middle Pleistocene. In all likelihood, the digging of the shafts proceeded from south to north. In the case of the layout of Corridor 0, after having made a deep cut in Layer 4, a trench was dug in the underlying sandstone bed, laying the brick roofing over the head of the bed itself. Corridor 0 runs into another hypogeal corridor that has been identified but not yet excavated, leading toward Shaft 1. The latter, like structures 2 and 3 and their respective linking corridors, was dug out of the sandstone bed. Once the drilling work encountered a greater thickness and hardness of the sandstone bed, to the north of Shafts 1-3, it became necessary to devise a system that would allow the work to be continued while preserving the exact vertical and horizontal positioning of Shafts 4 and 6 and of Corridor 5 (Fig. 21). For this reason the builders were obliged to reduce the thickness of the sandstone bed by digging a ditch 8 m long, 4 m wide and 2.20 m deep (Fig. 16). Having thus reduced the thickness of the rock it was possible to continue the construction of the shafts and connecting corridors, some of which, such as Shafts 1 and 6, were provided with steps in the side dug out of the natural rock. Others, like Shafts 2 and 3, were provided with four niches in the wall, dug out at a height of about 2.50 m above floor level.

Clayey marls are those in which the clayey component prevails strongly over the carbonate fraction, up to a maximum of 75%, and which are highly friable and densely stratified, and bluish-grey in colour. [21] 357</page><page sequence="22">Considering the hypogeal architectural complex consisting of shafts and corridors as a whole, I believe that the structure described hitherto may be identified as a complex system for collecting and managing water - a public work, perhaps linked to a ritual or palace structure yet to be identified some distance away from the remains discovered at Gua Made or else, more simply, related to the irrigation of the fields. An Advanced Hypothesis If we observe the entire construction in cross section (Fig. 20), it is possible to put forward an even more advanced hypothesis regarding its function; although perhaps a bold one, this hypothesis is not unfounded from the historical point of view and above all from the structural and functional standpoint. In this hypogeal structure, shafts and corridors alternate, dug out of the coarse tufaceous sandstone down to the depth of the impermeable clayey sedimentary rock layer (clayey marls). The shafts vary in depth from 6 to 7 m, and in length from 2 to 1.50 m, with a constant width of c. 1.30 m. The corridors themselves are c. 1.8 m high and c. 1-1.5 m wide and, in at least two cases (Corridors 0 and 5), have a brick roof. It is again emphasized that the type and building characteristics of this structure are unique in Indonesia, and that it is hypothesized that it was a water management and collection system. In other words, it was an aqueduct, the shafts and corridors of which under pressure from the water table, would bring the water to the surface. The structure as a whole bears a striking resemblance to the water transport system known as qanat in Arabic and kariz in Persian. The technology on which the qanat was based was developed in ancient Persia, perhaps at the beginning of the 1st 358 [22]</page><page sequence="23">vertical shafts Fig. 23 - Sketch section of the shafts and corridors at Gua Made. 1 = topsoil. 2 = alluvional sediment (coarse tufaceous sandstone). 3 = water table. 4 = impermeable layer (clayey marl). millennium B.C. and later carried eastward by the Islamic expansion as far as the present day province of Xinjiang as well as westward toward Morocco, the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily - where a decade or so ago a qanat was found in Palermo (Todaro 2003) - even extending, in the wake of Spanish colonization, as far as Peru and Chile (Buder 1933; Ward English 1968; Goblot 1969; Rahimi-Laridjani 1988; Covington 2006). A qanat (Fig. 22) consists of a series of vertical shafts linked by a gently sloping underground channel: this technique makes it possible to draw water from an aquifer and to transport it efficiently to the surface without any need for pumping; the water flows under the effect of gravity as the outlet is situated at a lower level than that of the intake. Although the shafts of Iranian qanats lie up to 20-30 m apart, the distance between one shaft and another is proportional to the work required to dig the shaft itself and to excavate the corridor or tunnel linking the shafts: the shallower the shafts the closer they are together and vice-versa. The tunnels are normally from 60 cm to elm wide and between 1 and 2 m high; in some cases, when the rock is too friable, the shaft is strengthened at the mouth by stone slabs or clay bricks, while the tunnels are reinforced by terracotta rings or stone slabs. Once the fault has been identified and its water flow rate tested by digging the 'mother well' (or trial shaft), the qanat is dug proceeding from the lower point, where the water must be brought to the surface and used, toward the highest point, that is, where the 'mother weir is located (Wulff 1967, 1973, 1988). Moreover, the shafts sometimes are provided with niches to house the light sources needed during the annual spring inspection of the water flow rate and cleaning the qanat, while the side benches facilitated the descent into the shaft. A comparison of the traditional structure of a qanat and the drawing of its cross section (Fig. 23) with the cross section of the hypogeal complex of Gua Made reveals a striking resemblance. The shafts of the hypogeal complex of Gua Made are actually quite shallow (max 7 m) and, as is normal in a qanat, are relatively closely spaced (between c. 7 and 12 m), also the size of the shafts and corridors are not dissimilar from those used in the Persian qanat. In the case of Shafts 2 and 3 niches are present that were possibly used to facilitate the descent inside the shafts and perhaps, as in the case of the Iranian qanat, support sources of illumination; moreover, the presence of [23] 359</page><page sequence="24">A B Fig. 24 - a. Iran: corridor of a qanat; b. Gua Made: underground corridor; c. Iran: view of the vertical shaft of a qanat\ d. view of the vertical Shaft 1 at Gua Made. dry brick masonry corbelled ceilings in Corridors 0 and 5 are indicative of the need to reinforce the internal part of the channel where the sandstone was more friable, thereby serving the same purpose as the terracotta rings used in the qanat (Fig. 24). If, as it appears, the comparison between the hypogeal structure of Gua Made and the qanat can be sustained from the structural point of view, it is equally justifiable to date its construction and use to around the 14th century, as it is around this time that the Islamic presence in Java can be documented. It is an established fact that the decades around the year 1300 witnessed the first settlement of Islamic communities on the coasts of Sumatra, where they established flourishing trading and port centres on that strip of sea separating the island from Malaysia. Starting from these early bases the Islamic communities reached the coasts of East Java in the 14th century, founding the port cities of Japara, Demak and Gresik. In the early 15th century, the Chinese chronicles - in particular the Yingyai 360 [24]</page><page sequence="25">Shenglan of Ma Huan (Mills 1970) - described the Kingdom of Majapahit as a multiethnic society where Muslim merchants, Chinese traders and indigenous people lived together peacefully, although professing different religions. In this context, also a certain amount of technical know-how was transferred, such as that required for fishing and for conveying water through underground conduits. If our hypothesis proves to be correct, the hypogeal structure of Gua Made, as well as being the easternmost water supply system using qanat technology - albeit adapted to suit the local environment and geology, as well as the local building tradition (i.e. corbelled brick ceilings) -, this structure would also represent the most concrete and some of the earliest evidence of the fruitful cultural interaction between the Islamic world and the cosmopolitan Kingdom of Majapahit, almost two centuries before its fall. In conclusion, nor should it be overlooked, that also on the basis of the foregoing the structures excavated at Gua Made, for the first time, in a comprehensive and controlled fashion, open up a new chapter in the archaeology of a region that can no longer be considered 'off the beaten track' vis-?-vis the centre of power of the Majapahit Kingdom.
