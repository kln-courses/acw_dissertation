<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kevin Bell. Ashes Taken for Fire: Aesthetic Modernism and the Critique of Identity. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 2007. x + 252 pp. Bell's lucidly theoretical study engages a critique of the essentializing social system of identity on two levels. First, it shows that such a critique underwrites the project of Anglo American modernism. Mov ing deftly across British, American, and specifically African Ameri can texts; high-cultural texts and genre fiction; and regionalist and metropolitan fiction, Bell traces modernism's many-faceted effort to register the chaos and multiplicity of subjectivity and to challenge the instrumental language that straightjackets subjectivity in rigid identity categories. Second, Bell's study makes this critique part of a challenge to literary scholarship's continued investment in identity politics, which drives a focus on social realism, historical periodiza tion, and linguistic denotation. Bell charges such scholarship with an inability to register the anti-identitarian politics of modernism and to recognize—theoretically and historically—the systematicity of the system of identity. In this broadest concern, Ashes Taken for Fire parallels recent political philosophies that interrogate the practical constraints of identity as well as affect theory and new materialism's focus on questions of materiality often overlooked in language-driven, poststructuralist accounts of subject formation. Bell's study specifically investigates how modernism thematizes the conflict between an originary, fluid subjectivity whose sensorium bears "contravening material/cultural/historical inscriptions" (12) and the social "imperatives of positionality" (14) that pressure the subject to abandon the "experimentality of its own experience" in favor of an illusory social coherence and belonging (2). Bell argues that modernism not only understands this chaotic subjectivity as "a sphere of unbound improvisation and possibility," it works to de velop an idiom that can capture this potential by making affective materiality the impetus for its stylistic colors, contours, fragments,</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews / Theory and Cultural Studies 195 sounds, and silences. Ultimately, Bell contends that modernism identifies those subjects who live out their multiplicity as existing in a "zone of blackness" that signifies death, opacity, social abjection, and fugitivity from self-mastery (3). These resistant subjects—the anthropomorphic model of which, Bell argues, is racial blackness internalize their exclusion from the "legislating zone of 'normativity'" and so are indifferent to social recognition (31). Formal modernism, Bell suggests, mirrors the threat of such indifference to cultural norms by enacting the "excess of meaning that over-burdens every term" by which characters announce their "completeness" (11). Bell's reading convincingly challenges critics who center modernism on a self-contained "I" removed from social reality, showing that modern ist aesthetics refuses "to reduce itself to the neutralized function of mere representation" and instead locates transformative power in the body and its figuration (5). Modernism's anti-identitarian politics thus abrogates "any pretense to solution" and dislocates itself from "mythic continuity" and "affirmative belonging" (6). Ashes Taken for Fire has three major parts. The first reexamines British literary impressionism—often seen as solipsistic—via Conrad's The Nigger of the "Narcissus" and Woolf's Jacob's Room, tracing how this movement mimes the elusiveness of the subjective void and the construction of social identity over it. Conrad's novel, Bell argues, uses the interactions between racially black characters, Donkin and James Wait, and their white shipmates to read two styles of social dealings with chaotic subjectivity. Donkin preys on his shipmates by exchanging a performance of social abjection for material assistance, while Wait, by contrast, remains utterly unresponsive to every "ap plied designation by which he would be interpellated" (49), leading his shipmates to both fear and desire him as the elimination of the difference against which they define themselves. Through Jacob's Room, Bell underscores the role of modernist idiom in embracing such a fractured subjectivity. The shifting focalization and free indirect dis course through which Woolf depicts protagonist Jacob Flanders stages subjective disorder and opacity, even though Jacob himself—acting as an elite white male—works to identify and thereby limit others who dwell happily in a realm of chaotic subjectivity. The second part of Bell's study maps American modernism, both regional and metropolitan, and more and less canonical, in relation to this realm, showing through chapters on Faulkner's Light in August and Nathaneal West's Miss Lonelyhearts the private consequences of a public mandate to replace subjectivity with cultural role play. On Bell's reading, Faulkner's novel uses the racially uncertain char acter of Joe Christmas to stage a "failure to 'identify'" and to show that it (not Joe's acts or supposed racial identity) sparks a violent</page><page sequence="3">196 MODERN FICTION STUDIES social defense—his eventual castration and murder at the town's hands (112). Like Jacob Flanders and unlike Joe, Miss Lonelyhearts's eponymous advice columnist resists the risks of nonidentity, using the idealized ethical programs expressed in his column to grope for a borrowed self-actualization. According to Bell, though Lonelyhearts is nauseated by mass-mediated, metropolitan life, he nonetheless relies on the metropolitan community to value his fight against subjective incomprehensibility. The final section of Bell's study reads the unique response of later African American modernism, broadly instanced by Ellison's In visible Man and Chester Himes's noir, to the racially managed chaos of subjectivity. Ellison's novel, Bell argues, shows that while racial blackness must incorporate a sense of its own deficiency before a fictive whiteness, it may also return to the subjective void only par tially veiled by race. The narrator moves from racialized experiences at the university and with the Brotherhood to a sovereign existence within a nonidentitarian "zone of blackness" by realizing that origins and ends are merely discursive and that a continually improvisational self offers a positive potential. Himes's work, Bell contends, similarly traces an "ineradicable blackness" both "anterior to the logic of ra cialization" and intensified by the "lived experience" of race (196). Himes's idiom interacts with bodies, institutions, and cultures not in terms of instrumental language but of "affective furor," showing that their "singularity" adheres in their ability to "convey meanings in excess of language" (205). Overall, Ashes Taken for Fire is compelling in its adept connec tions between numerous bodies of theory and the rare breadth of its literary analyses across national and cultural pockets of modern ism. This excellent book would, however, benefit from elaboration on three points. First, Bell examines only novels, which is odd in a study focused on the political force of modernist form and whose introduction invokes both poets and poetics (for example, through Baudelaire). If modernist narrative and/or a broader compulsion to narrate the self are key, more explicit theorization ofthat contention is needed. Second, while Bell aptly considers gender in certain textual analyses, his study would benefit from a more explicit theorization of gender's relation to social abjection and the "zone of blackness." Indeed, many moments in Bell's discussions of racial blackness imply a similar set of experiences for gender—for instance, Bell's appeal to Lacanian psychoanalysis (organized around sexual difference) or his use of ideologically charged terms like "engendering" (31; emphasis added) or "nightmare" (214; emphasis added). Finally, while one of the strengths of Bell's study is that he brings key claims in affect theory into modernist studies, he could engage that body of theory</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews /Theory and Cultural Studies 197 more explicitly, which would help to concretize the relations he un derstands among sensations, feelings, perceptions, materiality, and affect. As it stands, though, Ashes Taken for Fire is a forceful provo cation to current readings of modernist thought and form and to still reverberating claims in literary studies about the death of theory.
