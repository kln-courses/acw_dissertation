<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION: OBJECTIVISM AND INTERACTION: A REACTION TO MARGOLIS* MAY BRODBECK University of Minnesota Margolis [5] undertakes to reconcile the differences between those who accept and those who reject the possibility of a science of man. His peace offensive tenders a concession and a challenge. To the objectivist he concedes that motives may sometimes be causes and that there may be causal, scientific explanations of human actions. But with the critics of objectivism he insists that causes are "logically distinct" from motives and that noncausal motive explanations are also needed "in order to under- stand human actions as such." He interprets my remarks [2] to acknowledge not only different kinds of explanation, as I do, but also that motives are logically distinct from causes, as I do not. The challenge he issues concerns the relation between mental and bodily states. The objectivist, I argued, must opt for parallelism. Margolis protests that if we accept the truism that motives are sometimes causes, then we commit ourselves to interactionism. Hence the challenge. As Margolis sees it, either I am forced to deny the truism by ruling out motives from science, or I tacitly redefine the notion of cause. The first alternative allegedly casts doubt upon the objectivist pro- gram tout court. The second makes my position indistinguishable from interactionism. To focus the issue, I have simplified Margolis's schedule of alternatives, but I think no major points will be neglected. His remarks are a welcome stimulus to try again to say what I mean and mean what I say. Margolis does not tell us the nature of the "logical distinction" between motives and causes. He says only that they are "distinct and irreducible categories." But if motives can be causes, they are not so distinct as, say, the difference between a sound and a color or, to stay with our rabbits, between a thought and a sneeze. If reasons are some- times causes, the difference between them should somehow be amenable to explica- tion. At least, what people have had in mind by the distinction should be explicable. Unfortunately, for reasons that will appear, I cannot provide such an explication. However, I shall suggest one for the quite different distinction between explanation by (or talk about) causes and explanation by (or talk about) reasons. Though the explication provides legitimate grounds for this distinction, it does not imply that reasons and causes themselves are logically distinct. Margolis conflates that alleged distinction, which I did not make, with a quite different one, which I insist upon, namely, that between mental and bodily states. This conflation, I shall suggest, leads Margolis to his puzzles about interactionism. If you ask for or want to know my reason for some action, you do not ask for nor necessarily want to know its cause. If I give you a reason, I do not mean or intend to give you a cause. Yet, as Margolis agrees, the reason Jones cites for his action may also be among its causes. In that case, the two statements "Jones gave the reason for his action" and "Jones gave the cause for his action" are both true. Nevertheless, there are contexts in which these statements are not, salva veritate, replaceable for each other. If Smith believes that Jones gave a reason, he need not also believe that Jones gave a cause for his action. If Jones intended to give a reason, he did not necessarily * Received April, 1966. 287</page><page sequence="2">288 MAY BRODBECK also intend to give a cause, and so on. Though 'understanding', like 'believing', has a dispositional use, only its ultimate occurrent use to express a mental state is here relevant. States of mind such as thinking, believing, wanting, remembering, and understanding are about, mean, or intend something else.' This intentional meaning3 or object of thought is expressed in language by the dependent clause after the mental- act verb. Different linguistic expressions express different thoughts: intentional meaning is unique. Even if two different linguistic expressions have the same reference, they do not express the same thought. Mental-act contexts are therefore "referen- tially opaque" or nonextensional. Accordingly, if Smith understands that the motive for Jones's action was such-and-such, he need not also understand that the cause for his action was such-and-such, even if cause and motive are one. Clearly, we must distinguish between an explanation and understanding, since it makes good sense to say that someone did not understand an explanation. In particular, an adequate scientific explanation need not produce understanding. If 'explanation' is used as an achievement-verb, so that to explain has to understand as its converse relation, then this use of 'explanation' is also psychological and what holds for understanding holds for it. In mental-act contexts talk about causes cannot replace, salva veritate, talk about motives. This difference in intentional meaning between explanation by causes and explanation by reasons explicates, I believe, what may be meant by calling them logically or conceptually distinct. It also justifies the "understanding&gt;' part of Margolis's claim that motive-explanations may be needed in order "to understand actions as such." Regarding the "as such," which he emphasizes, I take this to refer to how we identify a bodily movement as an action. An action is a bodily movement that, to speak for the moment without causal commitment, manifests a mental state. This mental state may be a motive. (It need not be. I do not necessarily smile for a purpose, but only because I am amused.) If I do not understand what a person is doing, mention of his motive, whether or not that is also a cause, identifies the behavior as an action and to that extent I understand it. Bodily movements become intelligible if I am told their purpose. A difference in intentional meaning between talk about causes and talk about motives is clearly not sufficient to establish a logical distinction between causes and motives. Since difference in thought is carried by difference in linguistic expression, no two different ways of speaking-such as about the author of Ivanhoe instead of the author of Waverley-can replace each other in mental-act contexts. Yet, surely these are not "categorially' different things. This suggests that what is wanted is some way to distinguish reasons from causes, not merely talk about reasons from talk about causes. If it is allowed that motives are sometimes causes, I do not see any way to provide what is wanted. They cannot be distinct, irreducible categories. In fact, nothing is intrinsically either a cause or not a cause. Cause and effect are contextual notions. One event is a cause or effect of another. Nothing is a cause simpliciter, but only in relation to something else. Causes, therefore, do not constitute a separate category or kind of events. Whether to cite a motive is also to cite a cause depends upon the context. If a bodily movement is identified as an action by citing its motive, we do not thereby give 1 In ([2], pp. 311, 315) I distinguished four uses of 'meaning': the referential meaning1 of a term; its significance or contextual meaning2, given by the laws in which that term occurs; the intentional meaning3 of an act of thought, being that which it is about or directed towards; and psychological meaning4, a term within science referring to people's reactions to linguistic expressions.</page><page sequence="3">A REACTION TO MARGOLIS 289 the cause of that action, but only of the movement. To understand that someone is exercising, rather than having a fit or worshipping Allah, is not also to understand why he is. Motives may or may not be among the causes of his exercising-it could be just a habit, like chain-smoking. Since cause is a contextual notion, it makes no sense to speak either of replacing or not replacing causes by motives. Different ways of talking express different thoughts which differ in intentional meaning, but this difference between thoughts does not imply a logical distinction between motives and causes. A fortiori, objectivism is not the thesis that talk about causes can replace talk about motives. Objectivism is the thesis that for scientific purposes talk about bodily states can replace talk about mental states. Only if one restricts the realm of causes to bodily states-and I shall presently suggest a rationale for this restriction-can we explicate a "logical distinction" between motives and causes. Motives are intentional mental states. Bodily states are not about, do not intend or mean3 anything else. They are only correlated with other bodily states which they mean2, that is, are a sign of by virtue of the correlation. This difference in intentionality between mental and bodily states is an ontological distinction which, in the current idiom, may be called "logical." However, it does not distinguish motives from causes unless one holds that only bodily states can be causes. In that case alone intentional entities are, by a convention I shall discuss, never causes. But this restriction is exactly what Margolis rejects in the second part of his paper. Any account of the relation between mind and body must fit with four facts. First, both minds and bodies exist and are intrinsically different from each other. Second, we can know what other people are thinking and feeling. Third, the physical world, which includes the bodies of men, forms a closed system. Fourth, the mind affects the body and sometimes conversely. Margolis seems to accept the first fact when he agrees that pain and its criteria are not identical. However, his remarks about the second make me wonder. He tells us that motives are "publicly accessible and open to scru- tiny." If he means this literally, then he cannot be using the term "motive" to refer to a mental state. Perceiving is a conscious state; what we perceive is not. Thinking, desiring, intending, and the like, are also mental states. Bodily states, including overt behavior, are nonmental. The difference between mental and bodily states is intrinsic not contextual. Margolis confounds this real distinction with the spurious dichotomy between motives and causes. He seems to believe that, since we can often know what other people think or feel, their motives must be "open to scrutiny" yet somehow irreducibly different from causes. Happily, we can know other people's conscious motives, pains, or thoughts without inspecting their states of consciousness. To know does not mean to know nonin- ferentially or without criteria. A knowledge-claim is inferential, whether or not a conscious inference is made, if it requires justification by criteria or evidence. All claims about another person's states of mind require such justification. The only conscious states we know noninferentially or without criteria are our own, by having them not by observing them. Though we can't know other people's conscious states noninferentially, we can know them. Parallelism asserts that a mental state is present if and only if a corresponding bodily state is also present. Since we know our own mental states and observe our own and others' bodies, we can and do infer the mental states of others from their overt behavior. Parallelism thus accounts for the first two facts. On the broad sense of 'physical', not only the terms of physics, but also those referring to overt behavior, utterances, physiological states, and environmental characteristics 7</page><page sequence="4">290 MAY BRODBECK are all physical. In the previous paper I expressed the third fact by saying that the physical world is causally closed with respect to minds. I tried to explain how and why this does not conflict with common-sense interactionism by distinguishing various uses of the phrase "same fact." This time I shall try to do the job differently. Any description of a situation mentions certain features and omits others. Though a scientific description cannot and need not be exhaustive, it may, in a specifiable sense of 'completeness', be complete. The human body and its environment constitute a system. A description of a system is complete if, given that description at a certain time, we can by means of laws containing terms describing the system, infer its state at any other time. Nothing not mentioned in the description is needed in order to know what happens to the items that are mentioned. On the scientific frame of ref- erence, the physical world, including men's bodies, is such a complete or closed system: no nonphysical variables need be mentioned in the laws permitting inference from a physical state at any time to another at a different time. The evidence for this hypothesis is the whole of physics, psychophysics, neurophysiology, and behavior science. Margolis's plaint that this evidence is not cited is hardly reasonable. The breadth of the hypothesis suggests the term 'thesis' since, unlike a specific hypothesis about, say, whether a particular chemical causes hallucinations, it is tested by the whole of science rather than by any single set of experiments or observations. The evidence for physical closure, together with our common experience of mental states, is also the evidence for parallelism. Parallelism thus accounts for the first three facts. It also, as I shall try to explain, accounts for our common-sense interactionism. Common-sense interactionism is the truism that minds make a difference to the world. If there were no minds, there would be no poems, symphonies, houses, cars, slums, wars, and all the other delights and miseries of civilization. That's the fourth truism and parallelism accounts for it by describing how the mind affects the body, namely, through an intervening bodily state. Given a purely physical system, like the stars or the contents of a test-tube, completeness or physical closure is equiv- alent to the assertion that no other factors "make a difference" to what happens. But this alternative formulation will not do for man, since man is also a larger system coinsisting of both mental and bodily states. With respect to this enlarged system, it is not true that only physical properties "make a difference," although it is true that no nonphysical terms need be mentioned for the purpose of scientific explanation and prediction of the subsystem of bodily states. Parallelism, fitting with physical closure and common-sense interactionism, is the view that some physical states have two kinds of antecedent conditions, one physical, which the scientist must mention, the other mental and uniformly correlated with it, which for his purposes he need not mention. This indeed implies that mental states "have no place in science," which is precisely the objectivist view. If other people's conscious states were as "open to scrutiny" as their bodies, objectivism would need no defense. The problem only arises because they are not. It does not follow that mental states do not exist for science, whatever that means. Mental states exist as much as colors do. The behavior scientist, in principle, need not mention the former, any more than the physicist, in practice, mentions the latter. Their theories simply do not and, for their purposes, need not contain such terms.2 This does not mean that mental states have "nothing to do" with bodily states. Since 2 See ([3]) for a detailed discussion of the relation between scientific theories and the ordinary facts about minds and bodies which the theories explain.</page><page sequence="5">A REACTION TO MARGOLIS 291 a mental state is uniformly correlated with a bodily state, if the mental state were not present, then that physical state would be different from what it is. That is all that our common-sense interactionism asserts. Only an anthropomorphic notion of ceause', on which the mental state by virtue of some force in it "brings about' bodily changes, demands an unexplicated more intimate connection than uniform, lawful correlation. But mental states do not "cbring about" anything, only people do by virtue of having certain mental states.3 That brings me to Margolis's comments on causality. Parallelism does not "involve a redefinition of the term cause." Of all the conditions that make a difference to an event, which among them we select as "the cause" no- toriously depends upon our interests. Temporal sequence, manipulability, change in one of several antecedent conditions, and the ascription of responsibility, are some of the factors that determine which conditions we single out as "the cause" of an event. Both mental and physical states are among the conditions uniformly correlated with certain physical states. If anything may be called "the cause," it is the sum total of antecedent conditions, mental and physical alike. The scientist selects for mention as "causes" only those which are needed in order to completely infer everything that happens to bodily states. Such necessary and sufficient conditions for overt behavior need not and, in the case of actions, will not be its only conditions. The scientist ignores the mental correlates of neurophysiological conditions because, by the closure hypothesis, they are not needed for his purposes. In different contexts, the con- comitant mental states, if we know them, may just as well be cited as the causes. The scientist who mentions a neurophysiological state and the plain man who mentions its correlated mental state as a "cause" may both be right. Both events make a difference, since if the mental state were not present, the physical state would not be what it is. That is how we know what is going on in other people's minds. Philosophical interactionism says much more than the truism that the mind affects the body. As a doctrine about how it does so, traditional interactionism denies the third fact, namely, physical closure. The interactionist maintains that there are gaps in the physical process.4 Mental states are held to be the unmediated and sole causes of some physical states. Margolis, therefore, is not using "interactionism" in its usual philosophical sense when he asserts that "the interactionist holds that the linking between mental and bodily states obtains within the boundaries of science." The interactionist agrees with the objectivist that, by the usual scientific criteria of ob- jectivity and reliability, mental terms cannot occur in science. As against the objectivist, he maintains that therefore there cannot be a science of human actions. The difference between parallelism and interactionism is not over whether mental states are among the causes of bodily states, but over whether or not the human body and its environ- ment are, in the sense specified, a complete and closed system. Interactionism asserts that some physical events occur without physical causes. The evidence against this view is the same as that for physical closure. It is overwhelming. A philosophy of mind therefore must take account of it. Parallelism does and interactionism does not. Interactionism entails not merely that we have no evidence independently of bodily states for the occurrence of mental events in others, but that we have no evidence for them at all. Since it denies uniform correlation between mental and bodily states, two identical physical states could have different mental causes. From the outside, there- 3See also the excellent discussion by Davidson [4]. 4See Broad ([1], p. III).</page><page sequence="6">292 MAY BRODBECK fore, someone else's physical states, including his overt behavior, are wholly uncon- nected with his mental states. The agent has privileged access not only to his own mental states but, what is quite a different matter, also to the unique "causal" tie between them and his own bodily states. If another person behaves as we would when afraid, this affords no grounds for inferring that he feels fear. Since the sequence of bodily processes is open in both directions, from cause and to effect, we cannot tell by observing either antecedent or subsequent behavior that a movement was, say, done for a purpose. If the only cause and the only effect of some bodily states are unobserv- able mental events, then indeed we can never know what others are thinking and feeling. But in fact we can tell whether a person did something intentionally, not because his motives are literally "open to scrutiny," but because they are correlated with certain bodily states. An action, considered in objectivist terms, is a complex sequence of bodily events, some of which are correlated with mental events. The correlation is a lawful generalization that permits inference. By denying physical closure, interactionism renders our knowledge of other minds a mystery, if not a miracle. The difference between parallelism and interactionism is, therefore, con- siderably more than the "zero" that Margolis perceives. The objectivist, whose program rests on parallelism, indirectly speaks about mental events by speaking about their correlated bodily events, just as we often indirectly refer to or describe an event in terms of its causes or effects. He climbed through the window, he tried to get into the locked house, he frightened his sleeping wife, may be three different ways of referring to the same action, namely, climbing into the window. The first refers to it directly, the other two indirectly by cause and effect. Analogously, a bodily event, thinking-about-Italyo , is an effect or a concomitant of the mental state, thinking-about-Italy, . The scientist uses the first to talk indirectly about the second. To stipulate that they may be called the same2 by virtue of this relation is not to say that they "refer to the same events." Apparently, Margolis considered my use of subscripts, when I distinguished various uses of 'same fact', to be merely decorative. I was using them, most undecoratively, to mark a distinction of uses. Finally, objectivism is not the thesis that motives can replace causes, since, in the enlarged system of mind and body, that is a spurious dichotomy. Nor is it the thesis that talk about bodily states can literally replace talk about mental states, since these are irreducibly different. Objectivism is the thesis that for the purpose of scientific explanation and prediction of bodily states talk about bodily states can replace talk about mental states. The program is justified in principle by the parallelism between mental and bodily states. Its ultimate success depends upon whether or not we shall learn enough about bodily processes to be able to identify those that correspond to mental events. If we do not learn enough to identify the overt states correlated with mental states, then there is no other way by which we shall be able to completely and reliably explain or predict human actions.
