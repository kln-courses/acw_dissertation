<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexig APPROPRIATING WITH A PURPOSE: CINEMATIC CONTEXTS AND NARRATIVE STRATEGIES IN THE FICTION OF SHERMAN ALEXIE by KATHLEEN McCRACKEN 21</page><page sequence="2">Irish Journal of American Studies When the American Indian Movement (AIM) organised in 1968 in Minneapolis-St Paul, one of its objectives was to expose police brutality in the country's largest Native American urban ghetto. To this end, AIM founders Dennis Banks, George Mitchell and Clyde Bellecourt set up the AIM patrol, whose red-jacketed members monitored police conduct by photographing and audio-recording arrests. The consequence of this resistance was an immediate and dramatic decline in the number of Indian arrests and the Indian inmate population in the Minneapolis and Hennepin county jails.1 As Russell Means remembers, "It was one of AIM's first recognised successes.".2 The "Indian with a camera"3 embodied success in more ways that Means may have realised in 1968. From Edison's turn-of-the-century penny arcade vignettes of the Hopi Snake Dance and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show through Ford's Indian-fighting westerns to Costner's "sympathetic" Dances With Wolves (1990), Native Americans have been culturally misrepresented on the silver screen for the edification of the coloniser's gaze. AIM's self- protection programme turned that agenda on its head. In this new narrative, the "savages" - no longer bloodthirsty, vanishing, nor particularly noble - were doing the spectating. The cavalry had become the villains, the Indians the guardians of the people. Not only was this reversal a purposeful subversion of an inscribed storyline, but it also appropriated the medium which for more than half a century had popularly reinforced the doctrine of Manifest Destiny and the Doomed Culture theory. It was a tactic which fitted well with AIM's subsequent media-conscious protests on Alcatraz, in Washington, and at Wounded Knee, and which has informed their continuing campaign against popular distortions of Native Americans, and 22</page><page sequence="3">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie which prefigured efforts by Native photographers, filmmakers, painters and writers to "tell the story" from indigenous, marginalised points of view. Thirty years on, the strategy of the AIM patrol still provides an instructive paradigm for reading one Native writer's complex project of appropriation and subversion, revision and revitalisation. Sherman Alexie is a Spokane/ Coeur d'Alene poet, short story writer, novelist, songwriter and, most recently, screenwriter and co-producer, who grew up in Wellpinit, Washington, on the Spokane Indian reservation. Reviews of Alexie's early collections of poetry and prose poems noted an abundance of references to American popular culture, and to Hollywood cinema in particular.4 More recent studies of his short stories, published under the provocative title The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight In Heaven (1993), and of the novels, Reservation Blues (1995) and Indian Killer (1996), have focused on the implications and the effectiveness of the ways in which Alexie's fiction challenges Euro-America's ethnocentric version of American history and deconstructs the mainstream culture's racist misrepresentations (disseminated largely by film and television) of Native Americans. This article will argue that in revising and subverting the dominant culture's written narratives about and visual representations of Native Americans, Alexie not only constructs positive, empowering versions of history and self-representations for Native peoples, but that in doing so he, AIM-style, consciously "takes up the master's tools" by formally imitating cinematic contexts and narrative strategies. While the Spokane poet Gloria Bird has argued that Alexie's allusions to popular culture do not "serve as either a parody or as a serious 23</page><page sequence="4">Irish Journal of American Studies interrogation of popular culture" and that his fiction "perpetuates many of the stereotypes of native people"s literary critic James Cox has lucidly explained that: Whether in brief critique...or in full-scale revision and subversion.... Native American authors write new narratives of self-representation that critically question and often radically revise and subvert the dominant culture's conquest narratives and the mass-produced misrepresentations of Native Americans... the fiction writer intervenes in and rewrites the narratives of conquest by inserting Native American voices into the storytelling.6 My own position will contest Bird's view and build on Cox's, but it will also attempt to open the debate up to that condition which to me seems central to Alexie's aesthetic, and which, borrowing a buzzword from postcolonial theory, may be referred to as his "poetics of hybridity". By both rewriting the content and by usurping the technique of Euro-American narratives about and representations of Native Americans, Alexie's approach is doubly subversive. His "literary filmmaking" conflates with the primacy of storytelling throughout his work, thereby juxtaposing Native and Euro-America by means of influential media in each culture, stories (oral and written) and films. Analogously, within Alexie's narratives, two levels of experience, what Leslie Silko has identified as the spiritual and the corporeal dimension, are invoked.7 In the poetry and the fiction, this is registered by means of shifts from a predominantly realist mode into passages of magic realism, a tactic which creates a decidedly cinematic effect and which, given the situations and objects described, draws our attention to the analogy with documentary and fantasy film. What all of this feeds into or, more accurately, is fed by, is Alexie's own "hybrid" position, his personal straddling of two worlds, one foot in the 24</page><page sequence="5">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie reservation home town of Wellpinit, the other in the big cities of Spokane and New York. Alexie has written effectively of what it means to be "the new kind of warrior" - "But I was special, a former college student, a smart kid. I was one of those Indians who was supposed to make it, to rise above the rest of the reservation like a fucking eagle or something"8 - his poems dream the "new shape, somewhere/in the in-between.., a life between/the 3/16 that names me white/and the 13/16 that names me Indian."9 One consequence of that dilemma and that desire is writing that productively weds elements of traditional Native and contemporary Euro-American culture (Alexie's "Raybans and pow-wows" to), but which also reveals a fundamental ambivalence towards the exploitative power of mainstream media in general, and of film and television in particular. It is an ambivalence which, as Alexie himself has indicated, can only be resolved when those means of misrepresenting Native peoples are appropriated by Native peoples themselves.1' Getting beyond the anger and critically implementing cinematic contexts and narrative strategies, ultimately writing and directing one's own films, are potent ways of effecting that kind of change. A cursory reading of any one of Sherman Alexie's books might well give the impression that Indians, like most white people, are preoccupied with the moving image. The poems, stories and novels are populated by fathers and sons, cousins and sisters who are constantly watching television, going to drive-ins and cinemas, or feeling that life imitates the movies. While many of these scenarios are humorous, collectively they contribute to a polemical critique of the corrupting influence film and television have on Native life. Alexie's often less than subtle subtext indicts the damaging consequences 25</page><page sequence="6">Irish Journal ofAmerican Studies of the "white noise of Christopher Columbus' television set"12 for both whites and Natives, disseminating as it does the coloniser's false promises to and fictional narratives about Indians. The insidious yet pervasive impact of negative images registers in the protagonist of Reservation Blues, Thomas Builds-the-Fire's nightmare, in which television is associated with marginalisation, deprivation and, graphically, betrayal: Once on channel four, he watched three cowboys string telegraph wire across the Great Plains until confronted by the entire Sioux Nation, all on horseback. We come in friendship, the cowboys said to the Indians. In Thomas's dream, the Indians argued among themselves, whooped like Indians always do in movies and dreams, waved their bows and arrows wildly. Three Indian warriors dismounted and grabbed hold of the telegraph wire. We come in friendship, the cowboys said, cranked the generator, and electrocuted the three Indians. Those three Indians danced crazily, unable to release the wire, and the rest of the Sioux Nation rode off in superstitious panic. 13 But Alexie also criticises Native America's internalisation of such stereotypes as authentic markers of Indian identity: All us stoic Indians rehearsing for parts as extras in some eternal black and white western. Shit, used to be only whites expected Skins to have monosyllabic faces, but now, we even expect it of each other.14 As Alexie puts it in "The Marlon Brando Memorial Swimming Pool", a scathing piece of satire that cuts both ways, "The 20th century warrior relies/on HBO for his vision/at three in the morning" (OSNS 55). The obvious solution to this kind of assimilation would be for Natives to do as Alexie dramatises himself doing in an article on the men's movement: "press the mute button on the remote control".15 While simply vanishing the white noise may be an option for the strong-willed traditionalist, the 26</page><page sequence="7">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie majority of Natives need the guidance of a hero like the frequently invoked Oglala leader Crazy Horse who, Alexie imagines, "came/back to life/and started his own cable television channel and began the reeducation/of all of us who spent so many years/skinless" (FD 68). The greater challenge is to appropriate the medium of oppression and turn it to the subaltern's advantage. From his first collection of poems, The Business of Fancydancing (1992) through to the latest novel, Indian Killer, Alexie has worked this subversion in three ways: recounting North American history, and expressing the Native American experience, from a Native point of view; telling those versions through conflations of popular genres (westerns and road movies, the crime novel, blues lyrics) and the techniques of oral storytelling: and, most specifically, by appropriating cinematic narrative devices (montage, flashbacks, intercutting, pans, closeups, longshots, special effects) and deconstructing stereotypes (the drunken Indian, the stoical Indian, the Indian princess, the white man gone native). The opening of Reservation Blues provides an example of how these strategies can work in tandem. Here, the legendary blues guitarist Robert Johnson is alive and well and about to pay a visit to Wellpinit: In the one hundred and eleven years since the creation of the Spokane Indian Reservation in 1881, not one person, Indian or otherwise, had ever arrived there by accident. Wellpinit, the only town on the reservation, did not exist on most maps, so the black stranger surprised the whole tribe when he appeared with nothing more than the suit he wore and the guitar slung over his back.... A small man with very dark skin and huge hands, he wore a brown suit that looked good from a distance but grew more ragged, frayed at the cuffs, as he came into focus. (RB 3) As Johnson strolls past the Assembly of God Church, the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church, the narrator introduces the cast in order of 27</page><page sequence="8">Irish Journal of American Studies appearance - Simon, Lester FallsApart, Thomas Builds-the-Fire - then veers into dialogue before Johnson disappears in a long shot: "Thomas watched Johnson walk up the mountain until he was out of vision and beyond any story." (RB 8 - 9) The effect is subtly but decidedly cinematic: we could be watching the opening of High Plains Drifter, but in this version the white cowboy hero is a bedraggled black man pursued by a white devil, and the wild west town bespeaks a history of land seizure and forced removals, massacres and marginalisation. That the black man Johnson has sold his soul to the devil for talent is obviously a thematically, and indeed politically, crucial borrowing of both the Baron Samedi and the Faust myth, and represents a cognate literary reworking of key African American and Euro-American narratives within a Native context. However, the impression that we are reading a novel which constructs itself as a film is reinforced by Alexie's prefatory acknowledgement of the influence of Walter Hill's 1985 film Crossroads. Hinging as it does on the legend of Johnson having sold his soul to the devil, Crossroads not only furnished Alexie with a specific stylistic model, but it also provided a cinematic context within which to work out a key practical and thematic concern, namely, whether the achievement of success warrants commercialising one's culture and sacrificing personal happiness. Later in the novel, a comparable contextualisation finds Victor Joseph confronted with the spectre of his best friend, the suicide Junior Polatkin. The cinematic resonance is made explicit in Victor's semi-hysterical exclamation: '"What do you think this is? An American Werewolf in London? You're supposed to be a ghost, not a piece of raw meat." (RB 288) Admittedly humorous, the allusion is not merely a self-conscious 28</page><page sequence="9">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie construction;16 rather, it is made to place the novel within the film's critique of imperialism. Like the opening of Reservation Blues, the first chapter of Indian Killer is a notably cinematic rendering of how the central character (who intermittently imagines alternative histories for himself) constructs the scene of his birth. John Smith is an Indian adopted by white parents who, as his ironic appellation indicates, and as the novel skilfully reveals, is conflicted in his identity. Immediately after his delivery, John is air-lifted from the reservation to Seattle: A man in a white jumpsuit steps from the helicopter. Head ducked and body bent, the man runs toward the nurse. His features are hidden inside his white helmet. The nurse meets him halfway and hands him the baby John. ...The jumpsuit man holds John close to his chest as the helicopter rises. The helicopter gunman locks and loads, strafes the reservation with explosive shells. ...The helicopter circles downtown Seattle ... The jumpsuit man slides the door open with one arm and holds John in the other. Noise, heat. John cries, louder than before, trying to be heard. Home. The jumpsuit man steps down and runs across the lawn toward the man and woman, both white and handsome. He wears a gray suit and colorful tie. She wears a red dress with large, black buttons from throat to knee.17 Like Robert Johnson's arrival in Wellpinit, John Smith's fantasy contextualises the narrative within a cinematic framework. We recognise this sequence from any number of war movies or action thrillers; Alexie's innovation lies in using that popular convention to open a story about Euro-American domination and Native American revenge. Indeed, as with his sustained appropriation of the serial killer plot, a standby in the post- sixties Hollywood repertoire, and his politicised inversion of the popular literary and cinematic image of the Indian Killer, the ironic-parodic implication is that mainstream movies should and could be used to 29</page><page sequence="10">Irish Journal ofAmerican Studies address, and redress, serious social issues rather than simply to entertain. Like many of Alexie's early prose poems and stories, Reservation Blues and Indian Killer employ a range of identifiably cinematic strategies to structure the narrative. For instance, both novels read much like a film script. Direct, minimalist descriptions of people and places give the prose a script- like texture, while characters are introduced in the direct, perfunctory manner of a cast list. Each is named, allotted a succinct summary of appearance and role, and subsequently developed almost entirely through dialogue and action. Psychology, like background information, is conveyed by means of dream sequences, visions and flashbacks which are skilfully intercut with the immediate action, while chapter nine of Reservation Blues constitutes a carefully orchestrated sequence of narrative blocks to achieve a fractured time frame leading up to the suicide of one of the main characters, Junior Polatkin. Transitions from present to past are also frequently cinematic, as in this swish pan in the life of John Smith: "John walked along the girder and into the lunchroom at St. Francis High School ten years earlier." (IK 76). After remembering an altercation with schoolmates, "John left the St. Francis principal's office and nearly stepped off the girder he was walking on ten years later." (IK 79). Although Indian Killer involves a somewhat more sophisticated development of character than Reservation Blues, it too relies heavily, and effectively, on a montage- like juxtapositioning of memories and dreams, legal testimony and radio broadcasts, to carry the narrative. In her assessment of Reservation Blues, Gloria Bird has argued that Alexie's representations of Indians in the novel do not challenge but rather 30</page><page sequence="11">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie reinforce literary and cinematic stereotypes. She complains that the character named "the-man-who-was-probably-Lako ta", with his exaggeratedly high cheekbones and his Doomsday prophecies, deprecates Sioux culture, and that the depiction of Indians as victims of war and alcoholism internalises as well as capitalises upon negative self-images.'8 Alexie's "home movies", his "exaggeration of despair" as Bird labels it, may disturb Euro-American and Native American readers for different reasons, but his appropriation and exaggeration of cultural stereotypes has a specific purpose. By wresting these and other literary and cinematic stereotypes away from conventional usage, Native writers gain a subversive control over them. On the one hand, they are able to make plain to a Euro- American readership the extent to which negative stereotyping can become intemalised and consequently undermine Native individual and community life. (Witness, for example, the characters' pervasive confusion about what constitutes a "real Indian".) On the other hand, Native writers can manipulate the image of the drunken Indian or the vanishing warrior as a tool for self-criticism, as a means of firmly but responsively introducing a catalyst for change. The latter method of "healing" might be usefully described as "homeopathic", in that Alexie attempts to treat the "disease" by introducing small quantities of a "drug" which excites similar symptoms, but will build resistance to its effects.19 So to say, as Gloria Bird does, that Reservation Blues suffers from "terminal dysfunction as a native novel"20 not only begs a question (what is a native novel?), it is to miss the point. As the rest of Alexie's poetry and fiction, Reservation Blues is decidedly for and about Native people. 31</page><page sequence="12">Irish Journal of American Studies Like his appropriation of cinematic narrative structures and popular stereotypes, Alexie's revisions of American history and mythology are politically and aesthetically pointed. There is the subservient Tonto putting his dukes up to the masterful Lone Ranger, and the frequent manifestations of Crazy Horse and the rebel Spokane warrior Qualchan. There is the twentieth-century incarnation of US Army Generals George Wright, Philip H Sheridan, and George Armstrong Custer as executives for a recording company called Cavalry Records. And there is the cognisance of the English colonist John Smith in an orphaned Indian "kidnapped" by white parents, and of the Puritan preacher Cotton Mather in a wannabe University of Washington Professor of Native American Literature. All parody Hollywood's penchant for misrepresenting Native history and culture, but at the same time make serious statements about the continuing domination of Native peoples and the necessity for them to define and represent themselves. But Alexie's improvisations are also part of a stylistic interspersion of realism and magical realism or, read in cinematic terms, documentary and fantasy. Alexie's poems, stories and novels are laced with moments when the ordinary metamorphoses into the extraordinary, when the visionary, the dreamed, or the imagined impinges upon, or "supplements" the real, and through which we are made to understand that experience can be simultaneously "real" and "mythic". For example, when the storyteller Thomas Builds-the-Fire takes a hit of "A Drug Called Tradition", "Thomas looked around the car. Hell, he looked around our world then poked his head through some hole in the wall into another world. A better world." (LR and T 14). In another story, the narrator describes a half-hearted attempt 32</page><page sequence="13">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Atexie at suicide: "While I still held that pistol to my temple, I used my other hand to flip Adrian off. Then I made a fist with my third hand to gather a little bit of courage or stupidity, and wiped sweat from my forehead with my fourth hand." (LR and T 43). And in "Family Portrait", he remembers the summer the reservation disappeared: "Just like that, there was nothing there beyond the bottom step. My older brother told me he'd give me a quarter if I jumped into the unknown. My twin sisters cried equal tears; their bicycles had been parked out by the pine trees, all of it vanished" (LR and T 192). Such transformations are akin to the eponymous Indian Killer's shape-shifting from human form into an invisible owl, and likewise prefigure the magical elements in Reservation Blues. These include Johnson's guitar, which repairs itself, talks to Thomas, and precipitates the failure of the band Coyote Springs at their New York audition when it slices Victor's hands; the larger-than-life Big Mom, a contemporised, pan- Indian mediating figure like the Penobscot Corn Mother or the Navajo Changing Woman; and the recurrent screaming of 900 Palouse horses slaughtered by General George Wright in his retaliatory campaign against the allied Plateau tribes during the Coeur d'Alene War of 1858. Like the numerous flashbacks and dreams, these elements are part of the novel's spatialisation of time, its effort to represent mythic experience and emotional traumas and obsessions via metaphor and re-enactment. This is also in keeping with the novel's anthropomorphic, holistic vision of interdependence, epitomised in the reservation's drinking the blues like rainwater: The guitar played on and ignored Thomas's doubts. Music rose above the reservation, made its way into the clouds, and rained down. The reservation arched its back, opened its mouth, and drank deep because the music tasted so familiar. Thomas felt the movement, the shudder that passed through tree and 33</page><page sequence="14">Irish Joumal of American Studies stone, asphalt and aluminium. The music kept falling down, falling down. (RB 24) For the Euro-American reader, and for some Native readers, the primary stylistic cognate here is likely to be film. We have become familiar with such mixing of animation and reality-sequences via films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) or Space Jam (1997), so that here again it is possible to regard Alexie's narratives as appropriations of this cinematic strategy for the purpose of self-definition. What must be remembered, however, is that Alexie's writing also derives from the conventions of the Native American oral tradition, with its metaphoric density and its finely-tuned balance of the humorous and the serious, and equally from an indigenous perspective which sees the world mythically, and therefore makes few distinctions between physical and metaphysical dimensions, and which prioritises the spiritual equality and harmonious balance of human, animal and inanimate life. Viewed from a relevant literary-political angle, the dynamic, and indeed the "message", of Alexie's method approximates a feature which the critic Michael Bell has identified as crucial to the magical realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez: '"What is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modem culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed.".21 Like other Latin, African and Native American writers, Alexie does not combine historical realism and magical realism simply to disrupt narrative conventions in a playful, postmodern manner.22 Rather, he is intent on challenging the limitations and pointing out the consequences of the Cartesian split between mind and 34</page><page sequence="15">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie body, self and world. The psychic wholeness which is urged here is, by extension, deeply involved with the socio-political position of Native peoples in the Americas today. "Marginalised and repressed", it is vital for their cultural health, and that of the dominant culture, that their voices be heard. Understood within these contexts, Alexie's "filmmaking" can be seen as subversively rewriting Euro-American versions of Native American history and re-presenting Native American culture from an Indian perspective in an effort to, as Choctaw-Cherokee-Irish critic Louis Owens has put it, "reimaging an identity, to articulate a self within a Native American context".23 But the dimensions of that effort are daunting, and account for a fundamental ambivalence in Alexie's work. While Alexie repeatedly points out the corrupting influence film and television exert on Native peoples - "television is a way of never opening the front door" - he is also able to admit: "There is so much of this country I love, its supermarkets and bad television..." (OSNS 27). This not so peculiar love/hate relationship with mainstream American popular culture is enlarged, on the one hand, by Alexie's appropriation of cinematic contexts and narrative strategies, his muting of the white noise so that Native stories can be told, on the other, by his obvious knowledge about and delight in a whole range, not just of movies and television programmes, but of popular music and pulp fiction as well. It is an ambivalence perhaps best understood in the context of Louis Owens' remarks about the "hybrid" nature of writing which, like Alexie's, is the product of and for not one but two cultures: The effect is a richly hybridized dialogue aimed at those few with privileged knowledge - the traditionally educated Indian reader - as well as those with claims to a privileged discourse - 35</page><page sequence="16">Irish Journal of American Studies the Eurocentric reader. One effect of this hybridization is subversive: the American Indian writer places the Eurocentric reader on the outside, as "other," while the Indian reader (a comparatively small audience) is granted, for the first time, a privileged position. On the one hand, by consciously identifying her- or himself as "Indian' the writer seeks to establish a basis for authoritative, or externally persuasive, discourse; on the other hand, the writer must make that discourse internally persuasive for the non-Indian reader unaccustomed to peripherality. At the same time, the writer is appropriating an essentially "other" language and thus entering into dialogue with the language itself. The result of this exquisite balancing act is a matrix of incredible heteroglossia and linguistic torsions and an intensely political situation.24 Alexie's ambivalence may be an inevitable but, as I have tried to show, an intellectually energised and culturally empowering consequence of his efforts to negotiate the difficult terrain Owens describes. This "poetics of hybridity" has enabled a politicised appropriation and rewriting of what Ward Churchill has called "fantasies of the master race". But for Alexie,.his recent screenwriting and co-production of Smoke Signals (1998), a feature film adapted from a composite of stories in The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, along with his planned screen adaptation and direction of Indian Killer, mark the decisive subversion of Hollywood's legacy of misrepresentations of Native Americans, signalling a critical shift in who generates images of whom, and to what end. Given the paucity of mainstream feature films which have been written or directed by Native Americans, Alexie's films may just touch off the "awakening" of interest in a Native cinema which he has predicted. More importantly, it is to be hoped that they will, as Alexie himself has put it, "kill [the Hollywood Indian], make it impossible for anybody to make [that] type of movie again".25 Bearing this in mind, it is perhaps appropriate to conclude with the Laguna Pueblo writer and photographer Leslie Marmon Silko's thoughts on "the 36</page><page sequence="17">Cinematic Contexts and Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Sherman Alexie Indian with a camera": The Indian with a camera is frightening for a number of reasons. Euro-Americans desperately need to believe that the indigenous people and cultures that were destroyed were somehow less than human; Indian photographers are proof to the contrary. The Indian with a camera is an omen of a time in the future that all Euro-Americans unconsciously dread: the time when the indigenous people of the Americas will retake their land.... The Indian with a camera announces the twilight of Eurocentric America.26 37</page><page sequence="18">Irish Journal of American Studies END NOTES 1.
