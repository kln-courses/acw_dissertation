<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT: RELIGIOUS DIMENSIONS OF NATURALISM W. RICHARD COMSTOCK* APHILOSPHY of religion approached from a naturalistic perspective has contemporary relevance. Many theologies have converged on a common concern to avoid the presup- positions of a dualistic supernatural- ism.' Consequently, affinities between these efforts and naturalistic thought have become evident. Impressive phi- losophies of religion based on natural- istic foundations, like that of White- head, have already emerged, and further developments along these lines are possible. In this paper I offer a preliminary survey of the intellectual terrain on which further advances may take place. I make a historical comparison between an aspect of the thought of John Dewey and that of George Santayana, two leading figures in the formation of American naturalism. I show how tech- nical problems involved in their under- standing of the basic categories of ,naturalism lead to a consideration of the religious dimension implicit in them. I suggest that the religious issues emerging out of their thought have im- portance as pioneer explorations into a problem area of naturalism that is still pertinent to the present-day con- cerns of philosophy of religion. I. NATURALISMS IN CONFLICT Santayana's review of Dewey's Ex- perience and Nature in 1925 initiated an exchange of opinions that brings into sharp focus important issues involved in naturalism. Santayana calls Dewey's naturalism "half-hearted and short- winded."2 Two years later in the same journal Dewey replies that Santayana's naturalism, in turn, seems "as broken- backed as mine to him seems short- winded."3 The graphic terms might seem to indicate an even wider cleavage be- tween them than actually exists. Dewey suggests in conclusion that their rela- tionship seems to resemble "that of the Irishman who said the two men looked very much alike, especially one of them."4 Actually it is their agreement that is the necessary precondition for the meaningful conflict between them. The area of agreement is their com- mon understanding of two presupposi- tions of thought that they agree are the bases of a naturalistic philosophy-- first, the principle of the biological and physical conditions of consciousness, thought, and value, and, second, the principle of the continuity of all natural events. The point of disagreement is the conviction each expresses that the other has failed to adhere consistently to one or both of these principles. Furthermore, both agree in accepting * Mr. Comstock received the B.A. from Univer- sity of California (1948), B.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary (1954), the Th.M. from Princeton Theological Seminary (1959), and the Th.D. from Union Theological Seminary (1963).

The happy phrase is "the dominance of the foreground," which Santayana considers to be a major factor in Dewey's philosophy and the basis of the "half-hearted" quality of its natu- ralism.5 By a foreground Santayana means "the station assumed in the midst of nature by some creature tethered to a particular time and place." It is the view of the world as appre- hended from a distinctly human per- spective, and is "identical with nature, to the extent and in the aspects in which nature is disclosed to man."6 In other words, it is the realm of per- sonal consciousness and experiential immediacy, that private and personal vantage point from which each person first encounters and explores the cosmos in which he lives. Santayana's accusation against Dew- ey is that he has so emphasized this foreground in his philosophy that the larger natural background in which personal experience takes place has been either denied or radically mini- mized. Dewey feels the serious nature of this charge because he has partici- pated with Santayana in a philosophical rebellion against nineteenth-century idealisms that reduce nature's real background to the foreground of mental thought about nature. The new natural- ism of Dewey and Santayana argues, to the contrary, that "common sense is right . . . in regarding nature as the condition of mind and not mind as the condition of nature.'7 But now San- tayana finds that Dewey's naturalism has shown itself to be short of the wind of devotion to this first presupposition of naturalism and that it has reinstated its own form of the idealistic dominance of the foreground. However, there is a second presuppo- sition that both men share. It is, in Dewey's terms, the principle of the "thoroughgoing continuity" between all the objects and events of the natural world.s Again, both thinkers have been major figures in the historical reaction against radical dualisms in both re- ligion and philosophy-against theolo- gies that have made a fundamental dis- tinction between a natural world of things and organisms and a super- natural world of gods, spirits, and souls, and against classical metaphysics which, in their view, separates a physical realm of objects from a metaphysical realm of principles, ideal forms, and non- physical powers. It is on this point that Dewey ac- cuses Santayana of breaking the back of his naturalism by introducing a "structural dislocation of non-human and human existence."9 Dewey asserts that Santayana's "presupposition is a break between nature and man"; he has put "a gulf" between nature and man that "appears incredible, unnatu- ral," and "reminiscent of supernatural beliefs." Dewey avers: "To me human affairs . . . are projections, continua- tions, complications of the nature which exists in the physical and pre- human world. There is no gulf, no two spheres of existence, no 'bifurcation.' o10 In other words, he accuses Santayana of repudiating the second tenet of naturalism by severing in a radical</page><page sequence="3">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 121 manner the natural continuity between the foreground and the background of nature. The disagreement is generated by different applications of these two naturalistic principles. Dewey's empha- sis on the opposition to dualisms makes his position seem liable to the charge that fundamental distinctions have been obliterated and that either a material- ism denying consciousness and value or else an idealism denying the reality of external conditions has been unin- tentionally introduced. Hence Santa- yana avers that in this philosophy the foreground has absorbed the back- ground into its own substance. On the other hand, Santayana's in- sistence on the distinctions between foreground and background seems to lead to the formation of radical dual- isms. Hence Dewey can accuse Santa- yana of reinstating supernatural or metaphysical dichotomies of the kind that had supposedly been finally re- jected. No doubt this dilemma is generated in part by the terms in which it is stated. Dewey and Santayana are im- portant, but transitional, figures in the development of American naturalism and their thought may be accused of "embracing too many legacies from past controversies.""1 Still a contro- versy between sharp and perceptive thinkers will usually involve substantial issues. In this paper I attempt to dis- tinguish three significant areas of con- flict between Dewey and Santayana that can be characterized respectively as (1) ontological, (2) methodological, and (3) religious. Concerning the first two issues, I argue that Dewey is not guilty of the offenses with which Santayana accuses him but that Santa- yana is vulnerable to Dewey's charge. However, in considering the third is- sue, I point out that Santayana's cen- tral concern is with the religious re- sponse that is appropriate for a human being operating within a naturalistic perspective. When the conflict is viewed from this vantage point, Santayana's attack on Dewey does serve to clarify a dimension of naturalism that Dewey has recognized but examined only in a superficial manner. II. "HALF-HEARTED NATURALISM?" Having characterized Dewey's phi- losophy with the phrase "dominance of the foreground," Santayana then asks the question: "What now, looked at more narrowly, is the character of the foreground? Its name is Experience. . ..,12 Santayana's attack is aimed at what he considers is the vulnerable and exposed heart of Dewey's philosophy: its treatment of experience. The weap- on Santayana thrusts at this vital cen- ter has two prongs: One accuses Dewey of deeming human experience in its immediacy to be some kind of substantial hypostasis out of which all natural reality is composed; the other avers that, as a result of this view of experience, the substantiality and inde- pendence of nature's background in relation to human wishes and thoughts has been obscured. In developing the first point, San- tayana argues that in Dewey's thought "Immediacy, which was an episte- mological category, has become a physi- cal one: natural events are conceived to be compounded of such qualities as</page><page sequence="4">122 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION appear to human observers, as if the character and emergence of these qualities had nothing to do with the existence, position, and organs of those observers."'3 He goes so far as to as- sert that with Dewey "it is an axiom ... that nothing but the immediate is real" and "the dominance of the fore- ground has been turned from a bio- logical accident into a metaphysical principle.""4 The issue seems to be an ontological one concerning the nature or being of the world. It might also be termed metaphysical, and Dewey calls his approach in Experience and Nature a "naturalistic metaphysics."'5 By the adjective he means to express his con- tinued opposition to a Platonic or idealistic metaphysics that generates unnatural dualisms. But the noun is now used by him in a positive way to indicate the study of "the generic traits of existence," which, when adequately distinguished, will be "evidential of the character of the world.""' Santayana professes bewilderment. He asks, "in what sense is this system naturalistic? In what sense is it meta- physical? How comes it that these two characters (which to me seem contra- dictory) can be united in this philoso- phy?"17 But the question is disingenu- ous. During the period in which he re- views Dewey's work, Santayana is also working on a system of naturalistic thought that he calls ontological and which will involve "summary cate- gories of logic, meant to describe a single natural dynamic process."'18 In the light of this development the point of disagreement between Dewey and Santayana is sharpened on the ontological level. Bad company corrupts good manners; even polite relations with an unscrupulous person may have disastrous consequences. Santayana is suggesting that Dewey's dalliance with metaphysics has corrupted his natural- istic integrity. Dewey considers that Santayana's flirtation with ontology has led him to renounce his naturalistic faith. Each believes that the other is like a moralist who, having warned others about the blandishment of the evil sorceress, has himself fallen victim to her spells. Dewey expresses indignation at this accusation and, in the terms of the dis- cussion, he is clearly in the right. Dewey's metaphysics does not involve the hypostasis of the stuff of human experience into the stuff of nature it- self. Already in an early essay, he states, "I do not mean by 'immediate experience' any aboriginal stuff out of which things are evolved but I use the term to indicate the necessity of em- ploying in philosophy the direct de- scriptive method that has now made its way in all the natural sciences."'9 Dewey's innocence of a metaphysical subjectivism can be established most firmly by noting exactly what he means by "experience." Three important con- cerns are involved: (1) his view of ex- perience as a natural event, (2) his view of primary human experience, (3) his view of the place of experience in philosophic method. The term "experience" causes many readers to assume that the private in- ner experiences of a human conscious- ness alone are meant. But the other central terms in Dewey's vocabulary- events, interactions, processes, histories -must be noted as the means he uses to fashion the category of experience</page><page sequence="5">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 123 into a general class of basic natural events, of which human experiences are only one instance. Probably the most important characteristic of experience in Dewey's view is "interaction." He writes: "Things interacting are expe- rience." He insists that experiences are "events," which are "affairs" between things, whether they apply to "chemical change, the emergence of life, mind, or the episodes that compose human his- tory." Dewey argues that experience is more than something private, a matter of "my" experience of "yours." Rather, experience as a "serial course of af- fairs with their own characteristic properties and relationships, occurs, happens, and is what it is."20 Dewey considers that these events or affairs exhibit an initial beginning and a termination, end, culmination, or con- summation, like a musical phrase, the movement of waves of light, or the pulsation of a quantum of physical energy. Immediate qualities like the redness and beauty of a rose are ex- amples of the consummations of natu- ral events apprehended in and through human experience. Furthermore, events are in process. Thus a culmination is never final in the sense that no further interactions take place. One end be- comes the means to a further end, one termination becomes the beginning of another affair. Dewey turns to human experience as an example of rich and complicated natural experiences, that is, inter- actions, which, for obvious reasons, are particularly available as subject mat- ter for human scrutiny. Use is made of William James' radical empiricism to form a view of "primary" or "gross" human experience that has a greater complexity and richness than sense data or clear cognitive ideas alone indi- cate.2' Gross experience is "tangled and complex" because the human or- ganism has such a variety of ways of interacting with the events of surround- ing nature. The basic modes are "ac- tion and undergoing" and they reveal that "Empirically, things are pregnant, tragic, beautiful, humorous, settled, dis- turbed, comfortable, annoying, barren, harsh, consoling, splendid, fearful; are such immediately and in their own right and behalf."22 However, this emphasis on the rich- ness of gross experience does not sup- port Santayana's accusation: Dewey does not claim that human experience is the natural world. He does believe that gross human experience of the world, carefully refined and extended by scientific techniques, produces genu- ine knowledge about that world. Be- cause human knowledge is a clarifica- tion of a human perspective, it is not therefore without authentic cognitive reach into nature. According to Dewey, to emphasize experience is to empha- size the empirical method in philosophy and its two fundamental rules: First, all refined methods by which knowledge is obtained must have "their origin in primary experience, in all its hetero- geneity and fullness." Second, all re- fined conclusions must be brought back, at some point, to primary experience for verification.23 Thus Dewey answers Santayana's first point quite forcibly in Santayana's own terms. Dewey ar- gues: "Experience . . . constitutes . .. a foreground. But it is a foreground of nature. And: my "metaphysical principle" is that the related foreground may be taken as a method for deter-</page><page sequence="6">124 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION mining the traits of the background.""24 However, Santayana's objection has a second prong. In places he recognizes that Dewey means by experience more than subjective feelings and personal perspectives.25 Still, Santayana claims that Dewey has denied the substantial independence of the background in its relation to human concerns. Santayana feels that the resistance of objects to personal wishes and desires has been minimized.26 In other words, the butt of his attack is that Dewey has weak- ened the naturalistic tenet about ex- ternal conditions. He feels that with Dewey "actual experience sucks in the world" and that he belongs in the camp of those romantic pragmatists and transcendentalists who "hate external compulsions or supports; they can henceforth believe they are living in a moral universe that changes as they change, with no sky lowering over them save a portable canopy which they carry with them on their travels."271 But surely this is to distort Dewey's actual position. Dewey complains of Santayana's "lack of interest in my discussion of specific topics."28 It would seem that Santayana's neglect of Dew- ey's famous analysis of the problematic situation causes him to miss the force of Dewey's answer to this charge. Dewey argues that the empirical method "accepts at full value the fact that reflective thinking transforms con- fusion, ambiguity and discrepancy into illumination, definiteness and consist- ency. But it also points to the con- textual situation in which thinking oc- curs. It notes that the starting point is the actually problematic, and that the problematic phase resides in some actual and specifiable situation."29 It is at this point that Dewey's argu- ment is quite openly metaphysical in the naturalistic sense already described. Dewey believes that the characteris- tics or traits of the method discerned by a naturalistic philosophy also reveal actual characteristics or traits of the natural world in which this method as a human event takes place. When Dewey refers to his metaphysics as the discernment of the generic traits of existence, he has in mind two polar terms that can be variously designated as the precarious-stable, unclear-clari- fied, flux-order. These terms designate equally the phases in cognitive method and the actual traits of the world of which the method is a part. "We live in a world which is an impressive and irresistible mixture of sufficiencies, tight completenesses, order, recurrences, which make possible prediction and control and singularities, ambiguities, uncertain possibilities, processes going on to consequences as yet undeter- minate.''30 Insisting so emphatically on traits of the world that resist human desires and that form perplexing and some- times insoluble problems, Dewey feels that Santayana's second prong has menaced his position no more success- fully than the first had done. He be- lieves with some justification that his naturalism is whole-hearted; he has devised useful naturalistic categories that preserve in an impressive manner the continuities of nature, including the connections of human experience with the external conditions of nature on which it depends. III. "BROKEN-BACKED NATURALISM?" Dewey is able to show that he is not</page><page sequence="7">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 125 guilty of either an ontological identi- fication of foreground and background or a denial of the background as an independent reality. His own counter- accusation is that Santayana has sev- ered the natural continuities between foreground and background and con- sequently broken the back of his naturalism. The distinction between the onto- logical and the methodological form of this accusation is useful in sharpening its point. It has already been shown how Dewey's account of experience operates in the context of both onto- logical and methodological concerns. In his view, the two are integrally re- lated because an adequate account of method reveals generic traits of the contextual world in which the method operates successfully. The same relation appears also in Dewey's emphasis on continuity. Later naturalists have urged that this term be interpreted as referring only to a methodological principle that denies the separation of any sphere of human in- terest from the kind of clarification of experience that occurs in scientific and rational inquiry. According to this ap- proach, the methodological understand- ing makes ontological judgments about the continuity of "nature," "existence," or "reality" itself unnecessary.31 In Dewey's analysis the emphasis on con- tinuity as a method is dominant and perhaps the most significant aspect of his position. However, the emphasis on continuity in Experience and Nature clearly retains a metaphysical intent as well as a methodological one. In either form, Dewey's charge against Santayana has force. If the problem is approached on a methodo- logical level, Santayana seems to have violated a basic tenet of naturalism by severing the continuities between vari- ous phases of human inquiry into the cognitive import of primary organic experience. A brief sketch of Santa- yana's methodology will indicate the exact point at which this bifurcation takes place. In his early masterpiece, The Life of Reason, Santayana, like Dewey, reveals the influence of James's radical em- piricism. The first sentence asserts that "whatever forces may govern human life, if they are to be recognized by man, must betray themselves in human experience,"32 and it is followed by a description of the process whereby original chaotic experiences are clari- fied by the intelligent animal into knowledge of an external natural world and an inner discernment of human values and ideals. The later development of an ontology does not repudiate this methodological reliance on primary experience. An illuminating chapter in Scepticism and Animal Faith makes clear that Santa- yana's key ontological category-mat- ter or substance-is integrally related to the gross experiences of the living organism. He refers to "the inmost texture of experience," to its "solid body," and to a "primitive experience" that discloses dichotomies like "good and bad, near and far, coming and go- ing, fast and slow, just now and very soon" and which reports "the existence of something merely as existence, the weight, strain, danger and lapse of be- ing." "The radical stuff of experience is ... breathlessness, or pulsation ... a certain uneasiness.""33 Santayana then argues that an intelligent organ-</page><page sequence="8">126 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ism, by an act of animal faith, posits substance and a material world as the field for its action and reaction to realities sensed in the primary expe- rience just described. But why should Santayana assert that the knowledge derived from such basic experience requires "faith"? Evi- dently some wedge has been inserted into the continuities of these experi- ences creating a chasm that only faith can bridge. It is not difficult to discern the source of this wedge. It is Santa- yana's methodologcal shift from pri- mary experience to another specialized kind of experience that is the province of the foreground. Santayana argues that human consciousness has the capacity to achieve a state of alerted attention, an intense awareness in which clarity and distinction of focus are the dominant characteristics. He calls this special state of conscious- ness "spirit" or "spirituality"; the specific act of such attention is called "intuition"; and the datum or object of such an intuition is termed an "es- sence."M4 According to Santayana, an essence is defined by its own self identity as an object of intuitive attention. Es- sences can assume an infinite variety of forms: mathematical terms, aesthetic shapes or qualities, logical meanings and intents. In every instance an es- sence is wholly immediate, completely an appearance. In other words, it is all foreground, without any background at all. It does not exist, but is simply what it appears to be as the object of an actualized intuition. Furthermore, Santayana argues, the spiritual fulfil- ment of human life is to be found in a "passage into essence" when "intuition may fall on an essence beyond which it need not look."'35 The analysis seems odd to many readers, a curious blend (perhaps an unholy alliance) of Platonic forms with the "ideas" of the British empiri- cists.36 Santayana believes that he has clarified philosophical categories, but it is more likely that Dewey is right in accusing him of having severed natural continuities in a radical and unneces- sary manner. The intuition of an es- sence is what Dewey calls the consum- mation of an organic event in human consciousness. But a sound empirical method operating in the naturalist tradition will always seek to relate the data and terms of specialized experi- ences back to the context of the gross domain of human organic experiences in general and their interactions with the surrounding world. Santayana breaks the back of methodological con- tinuities by asserting that a movement of human concern from the contempla- tion of essences to practical engagement with the natural world can only be ac- complished "by animal faith and blind presumption.""'3 The objection still holds when ex- pressed in a metaphysical or ontological form. It then seems that in spite of re- peated insistence to the contrary, Santa- yana's objects of intuition have become rarified non-material entities, without physical existence, to be sure, but none- theless possessing a metaphysical being of pure appearance independently of the natural world of process and events. One example only, but a crucial one, must suffice to substantiate this point. Santayana reveals the weakness of his own position in the very place that he seeks to correct Dewey's view concern-</page><page sequence="9">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 127 ing immediate qualities. Santayana argues: We are told that consummations are them- selves fruitful and ends are also means. Yes, but in what sense? Of course, no earthly flame is so pure as to leave no ashes . . . One torch by material contact may kindle another torch; and if the torches are similar and the wind steady, the flames, too, may be similar and even continuous; but if anyone says that the visible splendor of one moment helps to pro- duce that of another, he does not seem ever to have seen the light.38 This is surely a curious notion to have to refute. Who would possibly think, even in a momentary lapse of clarity, that "the visible splendor" of a torch could have casual efficacy? Cer- tainly not Dewey, who rather holds that the visible splendor is an immediate quality, the culmination of one event (the ignition of the torch) and also the beginning (not the efficient cause) of other events-as when the visible splen- dor is used to illuminate a dark area of the room. Evidently it is Santayana's own posi- tion that makes him vulnerable to the suggestion that an essence-a bare ap- pearance-might be some kind of a rarified metaphysical entity to which one could quite naturally, though mis- takenly, attribute power and substan- tial existence. Dewey, on the contrary, wants to keep these particular culmina- tions of experience firmly connected with the rest of nature. By refusing to acknowledge the continuity of the foreground of appearance with the background of interacting events, San- tayana, not Dewey, has radically disturbed the coherence of a whole- heartedly naturalistic philosophy. If Santayana has not broken the back of his naturalism, he has surely sprained it beyond endurance at fundamental places. However, in the last section I show that the vital injury produces compen- sations. Santayana's attack on Dewey fails on the ontological and methodo- logical level, but, on a third level con- cerning the religious implications of naturalism, Santayana has a more via- ble position. IV. RELIGIOUS NATURALISM At the end of his review of Experi- ence and Nature, Santayana reveals that his reservations about Dewey's naturalism involve another dimension of concern than the technical problems so far considered. He observes that "God and matter are not any or all the definitions which philosophers may give them: they are the realities confronted in action, the mysterious but momen- tous background, which philosophers and other men mean to describe by their definitions or myths or sensible images.""9 He then urges his readers to employ their symbols of nature "prag- matically, with detachment and humor, trusting in the steady dispensations of the substance beyond."'4 Dewey has serious reservations about these expres- sions which, he says, indicate "a vague gesture of adoring faith in some all- comprehensive unknowable in contrast with which all human life-barring this one gesture-is specious and illusory."41 Again, as with the other points of difference, an area of agreement is here presupposed. In this case, it includes a shared fundamental moral concern. Santayana and Dewey are united in their opposition to the scientific materi- alism of the nineteenth century that</page><page sequence="10">128 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION seems to separate the human values, moral goods, and aesthetic qualities of existence from all connection with a supposedly "real" world of blind, mechanical forces. Both thinkers link their philosophies with the ancient con- cern for a wisdom that integrates knowl- edge about the world into "the hier- archy of goods, the architecture of values."42 As Dewey puts it, philosophy seeks "the way in which we can be genuinely naturalistic and yet maintain cherished values;" it is concerned with "the reconciliation of antithetical worlds of description and apprecia- tion.",43 The area of agreement includes that point where Santayana's moral lan- guage is eventually transferred into a religious one. He writes, "My phi- losophy neither is nor wishes to be scientific; not even in the sense in which in temper and method, the Summa of St. Thomas might be called scientific. My philosophy is like that of the ancients, a discipline of the mind and heart, a lay religion.44 A similar de- velopment occurs in Dewey's thought. In the Terry Lectures on "A Common Faith" he attempts to designate the naturalistic equivalents within human experience to those ultimate concerns of man that religion has in the past put into a supernatural framework.45 This problem of the religious orienta- tion proper to a vital naturalism reaches the dynamic center of their philoso- phies without committing them to the supernaturalism they have both repudi- ated in unambiguous terms. It is the character of a religious dimension of ultimate concern within human experi- ence, a search for what Santayana calls the "radical presuppositions implied in facing a world at all" that is still recog- nized by them both.46 When Santayana's metaphysical cate- gories are considered from this vantage point, some of the technical objections to them lose their force. H. D. Aiken makes the point in a masterful way: Fundamentally, his materialism is hardly a theory at all ... Santayana's doctrine of sub- stance, for example ... is in reality a sort of linguistic ritual in terms of which he pays homage to the factuality--or mystery-of existence. To call it "material" is hardly more, for him, than to evince one's natural piety before it, to signify, as it were, that one bows to its royal unconcern for the affairs of the spirit. .... Its "truth" is dramatic rather than logical or empirical. To regard it otherwise is to misconceive its function and to reify the very symbols by which it is expressed.47 The point is valid. However, it does not relieve Santayana of all technical responsibility for his position. It is his own decision to express his thought in metaphysical terms bristling with prob- lems that puts him at great dialectical disadvantage in the controversy with Dewey. However, when the issues are stated in such a way that the meta- physical vocabulary is subordinated to the question of the religious stance ap- propriate to naturalism, some of San- tayana's objections to Dewey's position become more convincing. Santayana delineates the outlines of a naturalistic-religious approach to the world by means of two expressive and apt terms-piety and spirituality. In a famous passage in The Life of Reason he defines piety as "loyalty to necessary conditions" and spirituality as the "de- votion to ideal ends.""8 Dewey finds the terms useful and recognizes their im- portance. As he sees it, piety refers to the healthy recognition of the forces</page><page sequence="11">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 129 and potentialities in nature that are the necessary foundation for human effort and advance. "The essentially unreli- gious attitude is that which attributes human achievement and purpose to man in isolation from the world of physical nature and his fellows. Our successes are dependent upon the co- operation of nature."*49 In The Life of Reason Santayana describes piety in similar terms. How- ever, even in that early work, and more clearly and emphatically in his later writings, Santayana urges that piety should extend its attention to that back- ground of human endeavor which is, at least in part, mysterious and non- human. These two adjectives and their synonyms are the crucial point at issue between Santayana and Dewey. Dewey considers them the bane of a vigorous naturalism. About the first he feels that reference to "the unknowable" or "in- scrutable" can only introduce obscur- antist discourse that has made itself unintelligible.50 After all, how can even the existence of that which is intrinsi- cally unknowable be known? Are not such terms a final evidence of San- tayana's severance of natural conti- nuities? The answer is not as obviously in the affirmative as Dewey believes. In his Logic Dewey makes the astute obser- vation that "the ideal of continuity is not self-explanatory. But its meaning excludes complete rupture on one side and mere repetitions of identities on the other."5- It can be argued that in stressing the mysterious, inscrutable, and unknown aspect of the background, Santayana is maintaining that element of difference, that lack of identity be- tween the background and the fore- ground of human attention that will prevent the monistic union of the two and the abrogation of any important distinction between them. If Santayana is in danger of widening the difference into a radical dualism, Dewey is in equal danger of bringing the two into a facile connection that approaches hu- manistic identification. Santayana's contribution to clarity on this issue is his emphasis on the sym- bolic texture of knowledge. All terms of thought-scientific, religious, artistic, philosophic-are, in his view, human signs that maintain an intrinsic sym- bolic distance from their intended ob- ject. Aspects of nature have a complex- ity that is incommensurate with the signs and essences available to the human organism and the "grossness" of its senses and symbolic tools only "catch its idle gestures."52 Santayana is convinced that a naturalist theory of knowledge must resist the idealist con- tention that knowledge and reality are, in essence, one. In his student days he made a fundamental decision that "our intelligence is not at the centre of things, but only at one point in their circumference"53 and puts this judg- ment into a famous aphorism: "Knowl- edge is a salutation, not an embrace."54 In making this point, Santayana does not believe that he is proscribing obscurantist limits beyond which sci- ence and reason may not pursue their inquiries. In his later writings he ex- presses his belief that the physical sci- ences may be on the verge of new and important breakthroughs in describing the fundamental patterns of nature. Nonetheless, Santayana believes that a wise piety will recognize the inherent limitations of human symbols gleaned</page><page sequence="12">130 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION from the foreground to dispel com- pletely the mysterious character of the background. The same issues are involved in the term "non-human," which Dewey ab- jures even more than the term "myste- rious." To him this adjective is another flagrant denial of the continuity of human processes with the rest of nature. He will not accept Santayana's "inser- tion of unaccountable and unnatural conditions and factors" into the matrix of natural events.55 However, at this point it is Dewey, rather than San- tayana, who puts himself at a disad- vantage. The logical fallacy of improper conversion is committed in the argu- ment that if every aspect of the human foreground is continuous with the natural background, then all aspects of the background are continuous with the foreground. Clarity requires distinc- tions. Naturalism demands that all human occurrences be viewed as con- tinuous with a larger background of physical and biological events. How- ever, it is no repudiation of this princi- ple that, in another sense, some aspects of the background are discontinuous with the foreground of human wishes and are inimical to its purposes. This is why Santayana argues that a mature natural piety does not look on nature as humane nature primarily, but as that mysterious substance existing independ- ently of man and only partially amena- ble to his wishes. He writes, "Natural- ism ... is something to which I am so thoroughly wedded that I like to call it materialism, so as to prevent all con- fusion with romantic naturalism like Goethe's, for instance, or that of Berg- son. Mine is the hard, non-humanistic naturalism of the Ionian philosophers, of Democritus, Lucretius, and Spi- noza."56 Does not Dewey agree? Does he not, in Experience and Nature, insist on the precarious, the uncertain and hazardous as examples in nature of his "generic traits?""' There is no doubt that Dewey is not without some sense of what San- tayana means, but the emphasis is "humanized" by presenting the precar- ious and problematic as but one pole in a total situation including the oppo- site pole of the stable, the solution, value realized and obtained. Although Dewey insists that man cannot be sure his ideals will prevail, the feeling gener- ated by his discussions at least in part disavows the negative possibility of failure. Problems are part of a process in which they are solved, difficulties in nature are part of events in which they are mastered. Dewey finds a humane import even in the frustrations of the background. He writes, "The union of the hazardous and the stable, of the in- complete and the recurrent, is the con- dition of all experience satisfaction as of our predicaments and problems. While it is the source of ignorance, error and failure of expectation, it is the source of the delight which fulfill- ments bring. For if there were nothing in the way, if there were no deviations and resistances, fulfillment would be at once, and in so being would fulfill noth- ing, but merely be."58 In The Life of Reason, Santayana argues in a similar fashion. But in his later works he perceives that not all of the hazardous and problematic aspects of existence can so readily be tamed, rationalized, and rendered acceptable to human feeling. Santayana's "ulti- mate religion" allows that "there may</page><page sequence="13">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 131 be surds, there may be hard facts, there may be dark abysses before which intelligence must be silent, for fear of going mad.""59 In a perceptive essay Lionel Trilling observed: "The abyss is there and his dreadful knowledge of it is what Americans fear in Santayana, just as it is the avoidance of the knowl- edge of the abyss that made Santayana fear America and flee it."60 A further consideration also leads Santayana to utilize terms like "myste- rious substance." Even in those events that are more human and less awesome in their proximity to the abyss, a strange contingency is revealed which ever eludes explanation. Reason and science can trace the traditional pat- tern uniting the various parts of the intricate processes of nature, but they have no means of discerning the reason why anything should exist at all.6' Nor does the position taken by many con- temporary philosophers that the ques- tion "Why is there anything at all?" is not only unanswerable but meaningless dismiss Santayana's point. For if the question is, in rational terms, meaning- less, we are still left with the experi- ence of our personal lives encountering its destiny within a background of mysterious powers only in part open to human understanding and control. "The emotion suggested by the term unknow- able is a legitimate emotion."62 San- tayana observes: "I am merely feeling the force, the friendliness, the hostility, the unfathomableness of the world." He responds: "I stand amazed. .. .",63 Of course, Santayana is not alone in his account of this feeling. Obvious affinities with Otto's classic account of the numinous emotion suggest them- selves, and many phenomenologists, existentialists, neo-Thomists, even some analytic philosophers, have described similar responses toward the mystery of existence."6 Furthermore, Dewey's account of a naturalistic method that utilizes primary experiences involving rich emotions and feelings in its tangled complexity could be adapted to this profound stance of the inner self. San- tayana's vital contribution to this phil- osophical discussion resides mainly in his vein of "radical clearness and ulti- mate courage" through which he ex- plores the qualities of natural piety while holding in suspension premature moral judgments about what attitudes are acceptable and what are not in this connection.65 For example, Dewey is sure that even to recognize this dimension is to advocate a "kneeling before the un- knowable and . . adjuration (sic) of all that is human.""6 But Santayana never makes such a recommendation, though he understands the quality of that kind of religious faith that "means an unspoken and sacrificial trust in an unfathomable power; not, in the deeper souls, confidence that we shall materi- ally or personally prosper under it, or be publicly vindicated or saved, but rather willingness to have been born, to have drunk our cup to the dregs. .2.."67 Santayana is clear: "Worship of this non-moral absolute will seem to me canine and slavish.""68 And he rather encourages a complex attitude combining two elements. First there is the element of recogni- tion, the simple act of opening wide one's eyes and seeing the character of nature as it is without illusion. In Naples Santayana overheard a conver- sation between a man and his small</page><page sequence="14">132 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION daughter about the origin of the railway station and tracks before them. The father was heard to insist with vehe- mence that God had nothing to do with it: "It was made by the hands of man." Santayana observes: ... This little scene shocked me. I saw the claw of Satan strike that child's soul and try to kill the idea of God in it. Why should I mind that? Was the idea of God alive at all in me? No: if you mean the traditional idea. But that was a symbol, vague, variable, mythical, anthropomorphic, the symbol for an overwhelming reality, a symbol that named and unified in human speech the incalculable powers on which our destiny depends .... The modern hatred of religion is hatred of the truth, hatred of all sublimity, hatred of the laughter of the gods. It is puerile human vanity trying to justify itself by a lie.69 Piety, to Santayana, begins in honesty, the recognition of those dimensions of nature that elude our understanding and are intractable to our designs. Second, Santayana advocates an at- titude that can perhaps best be charac- terized as acceptance. In religious terms, this decidedly does not include worship. Santayana agrees with Dewey in resisting the mystical pantheism that adores nature in its totality without distinction between what is humanly good and evil. However, he does urge an attitude that can be called "rever- ence."70 Since the inscrutable substance of nature is the very condition of life and well-being, a lack of respect for it will lead to pretentious errors in philosophy and even more unfortunate errors of judgment in action and be- havior. However, Santayana is unable to find total peace in this dimension. He notes: "There is a radical and necessary re- calcitrancy in the finite soul in the face of all this cosmic pomp and all this cosmic pressure."7' Finally, his piety is transformed into something else: spirituality. The inner attitude by which this is accomplished is called detach- ment. Santayana's discussion of spiritual detachment is important and profound. It adds a dimension in depth to Dewey's description of natural spirtuality as the contemplation in imagination of human ideals that moral effort then seeks to bring into concrete reality. According to Dewey, the term "God," if used at all, is recommended for that "active relation between ideal and actual" in which the effort to realize richer forms of human good is made.72 Santayana's greater sense of the tragic dimension of existence leads him to consider a possible deepening of this spirtual quality of life. He believes that the human spirit is capable of detachment from a state of parochial enchantment with its limited ideals into a broad and comprehensive sympathy with the alien ideals of other organisms. A contemplative appreciation of the infinite variety of ideal possibilities that men in various times and climes have entertained is then cultivated.73 Under what conditions does such a state of consciousness occur? San- tayana refers to "disillusionment," and to "disintoxication.""7 It is man's en- counter with tragedy, disappointment, and frustration that initiates his move- ment toward inner spirtual liberation. In this context Santayana's attack on Dewey assumes its full force. Dewey's philosophy does stress the "dominance of the foreground," but not as a meta- physical principle. Dewey has over- emphasized man's preoccupation with his personal plans and allowed them to make imperialistic claims to occupy his total concern and attention. He has</page><page sequence="15">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 133 neglected that spiritual attention to the background, which, though alien to man's private dreams, can be liberating and even healing. Santayana might address Dewey in the words that occur in one of his dialogues in limbo: "You are the prophet of success. But how much success is there or has there ever been on earth? Who shall be the prophet of old age, of sorrow, of servi- tude? What God shall help us where we have failed?"75 A suspicion will be created by such a passage that Santayana's approach represents a "failure of nerve" in which the private self retreats from the struggles of an existence too severe for its tender sensibilities. Such an objec- tion however, indicates a misunder- standing of Santayana's point in a fundamental way. This spirtual stance is not "escapist" in tendency because, while it does offer an equilibrium to the self when it meets those failures that an honest philosophy must surely acknowledge as a part of our human lot, it also provides a strengthening of man's continued en- deavors in the field of action. The spiritual man combines an attitude of disengagement with the continued pur- suit of his practical aims. An example is the account in the Mahabharata of Arjuna, the Indian prince who, after the reception of liberating insight, goes into the battle that he now will fight with both vigor and detachment. San- tayana believes: "Detachment leaves you content to be where you are, and what you are. . ... Yet in your physical particularity detachment makes you ideally impartial; and in enlightening your mind it is likely to render your action also more successful and gener- ous."76 Such an account is suggestive and profound. Santayana is convincing in his attempt to show that the "natural- ness" of religious contemplation, de- tachment, and sense of the mysterious is more consistent with the tenet assert- ing the continuities between all human experience than is the tendency of those narrow humanisms which con- sign by fiat all such matters to the outer darkness of obscurantist discourse. It is this intolerant excommunication that is guilty of severing a significant dimension of the foreground from all contact with the other affairs of life. Yet spirituality is as "natural" an at- tainment as is an optimistic immersion in practical goals untouched by a tragic sense of existence. Santayana insists that spirtual lives have actually been lived by impressive figures in the his- tory of philosophy, religion, and art.17 A sophisticated and urbane naturalism will include their findings in its com- prehensive account of the human situa- tion. This is not to say that Santayana's own account of these findings requires no correction and development. One example of the weakness of his position is his curious insistence that spirituality involves the ideal contemplation of es- sences as ends or fulfilments that have no further reference to the natural world of existence. Dewey's repeated insistence that ideal consummations are themselves fruitful and the means to further ends offers a necessary correc- tion at this point.78 Furthermore, Santayana's piety and spirituality lack a significant orienta- tion toward the social dimension of human life. Santayana informs the reader that "consciousness is a born hermit" and that "spirit cannot live</page><page sequence="16">134 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION except alone."'9 In contrast Dewey pre- sents a superb analysis of communica- tion and meaning in which he shows how signs and essences are terms of discourse that originate in events of social interaction through gesture, phys- ical reaction, and language.80 Thus Dewey provides a natural locus for that field of meanings which Santayana can only place in an unsatisfactory meta- physical "realm" of essences. Santayana tries to avoid the menace of "Lucifer's" separation of inner spiritual contempla- tion from all respect and attachment to the communal matrix in which con- sciousness is formed and maintained, but the tendency to this error weakens his position.s8 Finally, Santayana's analysis per- petuates a spiritual split between fore- ground and background that the West- ern religious tradition has been unwill- ing to accept. In discussing the concept of "God," Santayana perceives that "a god's majesty lies in his power,"82 but he refuses to countenance human wor- ship of the non-human character of the power revealed in the background of our existence. On the other hand, the ultimate ideal of the foreground, even when purged of parochial limitations by a spiritual discipline is, in his view, a non-existent essence separated from all dynamic efficacy on the affairs of life. Hence it is worthy of love, perhaps adoration, but hardly worship as "God" in any traditional sense, however quali- fied.83 Santayana's religious solution (his personal "salvation") is a spiritual de- tachment that is ultimately a stoical resignation and courage healing only the foreground of the inner self. No possibility of the radical transformation of the background is entertained and the "cosmic" salvation described by some of the great religions is denied. Santayana's circumspection and skepti- cal honesty in this respect are commend- able. The possibility of discerning a more integral relation between the back- ground of power and the foreground of human ideals however, requires further exploration and is a task still to be accomplished by present-day philoso- phies of religion. In spite of these shortcomings, San- tayana's contribution to philosophic wisdom is an impressive one. His dis- agreement with Dewey makes an im- portant point, though the conclusion to which it leads is somewhat paradoxical. For it now appears that Santayana has not shown that Dewey has emphasized unduly the foreground and neglected the background. On the contrary, Dewey has given a good account in naturalistic terms of the continuities between them. What Santayana has shown is that Dewey has overempha- sized that part of the foreground con- cerned with the practical goals of life and neglected another part of the fore- ground concerned with the appropriate religious attitude that liberates the self from parochial obsessions. No doubt Dewey drew back from this emphasis of Santayana's because of his desire to avoid any distraction from the important enterprise of in- creasing concrete goods within the human situation. But Santayana shows that such a moralism will become trapped in a provincial foreground of limited awareness unless a pious sense of the mystery of existence and a spirit- ual detachment from narrow concerns are also cultivated. Dewey is right. He and Santayana</page><page sequence="17">DEWEY AND SANTAYANA IN CONFLICT 135 remain very much alike. Santayana has not offered an alternative to Dewey's position, but a needed supplement to it. Dewey's broad categories of thought maintain the solid "orthodoxy" of com- mon sense, while Santayana may seem the "heretic" who has denied the naturalist faith.84 His "heresy," how- ever, is a needed corrective that deep- ens and enlarges the scope of Dewey's humane vision of man's pursuit of value within the natural world.

John Dewey, "The Postulate of Immediate Empiricism," in The Influence of Darwin on Phi- losophy (New York: Peter Smith, 1910), p. 240. Dewey accuses Santayana of having "a number of pigeonholes into which every philosophy must go with its appropriate, fixed, and absolute tag at- tached" (HHN, p. 64). The present issue is a case in point. Santayana had decided that the radi- cal empiricism of William James implied that "ex- perience or mental discourse not only constituted a set of substantive facts, but the only substantive facts ... this psychological flux .. . was the funda- mental existence" (Character and Opinion in the United States [New York: George Brazillar, 1955], pp. 42-43). There is no doubt that the suggestion does occur in James's exploratory essays, but the tentative manner of statement should be noted. For example: "My thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which every- thing is composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience' .. . ." (Essays in Radical Empiricism [New York: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1912], p. 4). It then becomes one of Santayana's favorite historical judgments to aver that British Em- piricism, German Idealism, and American Prag- matism all make exactly the same error, by turn-</page><page sequence="18">136 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ing private human experience into the metaphysical stuff of the universe (SAF, chapter xxvii). San- tayana's charge is that Dewey has inherited this "general heirloom" (DNM, p. 657), but Dewey is surely justified in requesting that the details of his position be examined before he is indiscriminately assigned to this broad pigeonhole of metaphysical subjectivism. 20.
