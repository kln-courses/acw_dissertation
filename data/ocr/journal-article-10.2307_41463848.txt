<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Model for Human Body Composition by Total Body Counting BY RAY D. LLOYD1 AND CHARLES W. MAYS1 Abstract The fat content of living subjects was determined by a model of human body composition based upon total-body 40K counting but without the assumption of a constant potassium concentration in the lean body mass (adipose-free mass). Calibration of the human counter had been accom- plished by the administration of 42K and other gammy-ray emitters to hu- mans of various sizes and ages with the concurrent comparison of their counting rates per retained unit of radioactivity against those of radioactive standards counted in a series of polyethylene phantoms of varying thickness. Those phantoms representing obese individuals had thick layers of non- radioactive absorber surrounding the radioactivity. The body composition model includes data for individuals of both sexes and for ages from newborn to adult. Results are compared with those obtained by other investigators, most importantly from studies of cadaver composition and also from studies of living persons by anthropometry, densitometry, etc. A conflict among authors concerning the fat content of normal and obese subjects is reviewed. Application of the model to investigation of patients receiving medical or surgical treatment is described for morbid obesity, kidney disease, liver disease and metabolic disorders. Measurement of body fat in the living human can be accomplished only by indirect methods. Each of these has its limitations and each relies on a certain number of assumptions, but all seem to be useful if standardized properly and applied in a self-consistent manner. Nevertheless, results concerning the fat content of normal and obese subjects that are reported in the literature are in conflict. In this paper we summarize these data and describe a new model that relies on fewer assumptions. The definition of "fat" or "adipose tissue" or "ether extractable tissue" is not consistent among various authors. However, the termi- nology used in the original sources will also be used herein. Some of the techniques used to estimate body fat by indirect methods (see Appendix) include weight/height ratios, circumference measurements, skinfold thickness measurements, isotope dilution, hydrostatic weighing, gas displace- ment weighing, radiographic studies, inert gas inhalation, photon absorption, ^adiobiology Division, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112.

MAYS and total-body potassium (K) measurements by in vivo counting using the 1.46 MeV gamma-ray emission of the naturally-occurring potassium isotope, 40K. It has been pointed out (Bonnet and Rocour-Brumioul, 1981) that only the subcutaneous fat can be estimated by methods as simple as skinfold measure- ments, whereas a significant amount of body fat is located intra-abdominally and elsewhere (Anderson et al. 1982; Grauer et al. 1984; Fanelli and Kuczmarski 1984). Häger (1981) stated that there are two critical assumptions which must be made in the derivation of body fat from skinfold measurements. They are that subcutaneous fat constitutes a constant proportion of total body fat over all ranges of body weight, and that the sites of measurement are representative of all subcutaneous fat. The same author asserted that it is unlikely that both these assumptions are true. Estimates of body fat by weight/height ratios or circumference measure- ments in many unusually fit, muscular individuals and especially in typical athletes classify them incorrectly as obese (Clark et al. 1977; Allen 1963; Welham and Behnke 1942; Flint et al. 1977). Body density measurements have their own unique problems. These can be of concern even when the proper correction is made for such usual confound- ing factors as residual air in the lungs and gas in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and when care is taken that the subjects are completely submerged in the fluid for weighing with no air bubbles on the skin surface. The observation that lean body mass (adipose-free mass) does not have a constant density from subject to subject introduces further uncertainty into results obtained by gravimetric meth- ods (Häger 1981; Allen 1963; Welham and Behnke 1942; Flint et al. 1977; Wang and Pierson 1976). Some determinations of lean body mass from total body 40K measurements use the assumption that so-called "lean body mass" (adipose-free mass) has an unvarying potassium concentration. These results can be as equivocal as those resulting from the other measurement methods, since the composition of the lean body is inconstant and changes throughout life (Wedgewood 1963; Cox and Shalaby 1981; Wang and Pierson 1976; Pierson et al. 1974; Brozek 1968). However, Hägar (1981) claimed that measurement of 40K is perhaps the prefera- ble method for all age groups in scientific investigations on body composition with demand for an exact method, and Pierson et al. (1982) asserted that the measurement of body potassium by the 40K technique is the most stable and reliable method available. The literature on fat content of normal humans generally falls into two separate and conflicting groups ("A" and "B"), described in the Appendix. Values in Group A cluster around 20% to 40% fat in obese persons of both sexes and about 5% to 10% in normal subjects, while studies in Group B indicate about 20% fat in normal young adult men and 30% in normal young adult women, with values in particularly fit individuals that are somewhat lower</page><page sequence="3">A Model for Human Body Composition / 9 (10%- 15%) and those in older individuals and especially in obese persons that are considerably higher, up to 50% and greater. Each of the indirect measurement systems ultimately must be compared with the direct method of cadaver analysis for verification. Widdowson (1965) and Häger (1981) asserted that the only direct methods are studies on dead bodies and that the analyses of cadavers are the reference data against which all other indirect methods should be validated. Only a limited number of cadavers have been subject to chemical analysis, and just a very few of these have been submitted for the determination of body fat (Clark et al. 1977; Forbes and Lewis 1956; Mitchell et al. 1945; Widdowson et al. 1951; Forbes et al. 1953; Brozek et al. 1963; Keys and Brozek 1953; Clarys et al 1984). The model described herein is intended to show how total-body potassium counting can be used to estimate body fat without the necessary assumption of a constant potassium concentration in lean body mass. Results of our model appeared to be similar to those found in Group B (see Appendix) and seemed to compare well with those from cadaver analysis. Also, some experience with applications of the model is described. Methods The human total-body counter used in these studies (Lloyd et al. 1979) consists of a pair of 8 X 4 inch Nal (Tl) crystals suspended above an isoresponse surface upon which the person reclines (Fig. 1). Subject and detectors are enclosed within a low radiation background chamber constructed of 12 inch thick steel. Calibration for 40K at 1.46 MeV and other photon emitters was accomplished by the administration to humans of various sizes and body configu- rations of 42K (gamma-ray energy = 1.52 MeV) and such other emitters as 24Na, 83Rb and 137Cs (Lloyd et al. 1979). Known amounts of each emitter were counted, concurrently with the human subjects, in a series of human phantoms made of various thicknesses of polyethylene to simulate the anticipated range of human body thickness. For phantoms representing obese subjects, the radioac- tivity was surrounded by a substantial layer of nonradioactive absorber. Details of the calibration procedures are given by Lloyd et al. (1979). The statistical standard deviation in body potassium content for a single 50 minute determina- tion was reported to be about ± 2% or ± 3 g K in a typical adult male. In a few instances, individual subjects were counted twice on the same day or within a few days when, presumably, their body K content was about the same. These measurements provided data on the overall uncertainty of body potassium determinations.</page><page sequence="4">10 / RAY D. LLOYD AND CHARLES W. MAYS Figure 1. Photograph of the counting arrangement used for measuring total-body po- tassium in humans, showing the two 8x4 inch Nal(Tl) crystals suspended above an isoresponse surface upon which the subject reclines. Comparison of the subject's 40K counting rate at 1.46 MeV with the 40K counting rate of a KCl standard using an appropriate calibration factor yielded the grams of total-body potassium (1 g K = 848 pCi 40K or 39. 1 mEq K). Then the conventional potassium parameter, gK/kg body, could be calculated. In addition, the Muscle Index (MI), defined as the ratio of the subject's body potassium to that in a reference human of the same height, was determined as, for example, (Wagner et al. 1966): . _ body potassium 140 g K (height/ 174 cm)3 ' based upon a reference adult male 174 cm in height who contained 140 g K.

It does not necessarily assume that the potassium concentration of "lean body mass" (everything except fat) is con- stant. Varying proportions of the individual components would produce differ- ent values of total-body potassium and would result in varying potassium con- centrations of "lean body mass" ("adipose-free mass"). The term "adipose tissue" includes blood vessels, connective tissue, fat storage cells, etc., associ- ated with the body substance commonly referred to as "fat." Wagner et al. did not specify whether their term "fat" was synonymous with "adipose tissue." In our model, muscle, GI tract, liver, brain, lungs and "other" (Table 1) were taken to be proportional in mass to total-body potassium, while the mass of skin was taken to be proportional to body surface area and the mass of skeleton was taken to be proportional to both height and body potassium, since it has been shown (Trotter 1956) that skeletal weight is positively correlated with stature as well as with muscle mass. Body surface area, = A m2, was calculated from body weight, = W kg, and height, = H cm, by the formula of Brody et al. (1928), A - 0.024 (W0-53 H0-40). The formula in this 1928 reference has been validated more recently by Martin et al. (1984) from analysis of 17 cadavers. Equation (5) given by them, A = 0.0235 (W0 52 H°-42), described their data very well. The mean ± S. D. for all 17 ratios of (predicted surface area by formula/measured surface area) was 1.0 ± 0.1 for both the formula given by Brody et al. (1928) and by their Equation (5).</page><page sequence="6">12 / RAY D. LLOYD AND CHARLES W. MAYS Since the Reference Human (Table 1) represented only an adult male, a search of the literature was undertaken to discover data which could be used to construct reference humans of both sexes from birth to adulthood. Appropriate information was found in a number of references (see Appendix). These data were plotted, and the resulting graphs are shown in Figs. 2-12. This set of graphs was used to produce a series of 28 tables (not reproduced here) in which the mass and potassium content of each body component listed in Table 1 was given for males and females of ages corresponding to newborn, 3 months, and each year from ages 1 to 18 plus the adult age of 25 (the adult male aged 25 is identical to Table 1). Skin mass/m2, skeletal mass/cm height, skeletal mass/g body K, and tissue mass/g body K for males and females of each age were derived from these tables and used for calculation of body composition parameters, including the Muscle Index. These tables were used with the measured total-body potassium to calculate the fat content as shown in the following example: Adult male subject GW, aged 57, 81.9 kg, 184.5 cm, containing 171.0 ± 3.1 g K = 2.09 g K/kg, and calculated body surface area = 2.0 m2; from Table 1 values, 1/2 [(0.0603 kg skel/cm) (184.5 cm) = 11.13 kg skeleton + (0.075 kg skel/g K) (171 g K) = 12.83 kg skeleton] = 12.0 kg skeleton; 2.5 kg skin/m2 (2m2) = 5.0 kg skin; 171 g K times the respective (kg tissue/gK) from Table 1 yielded 34.2 kg muscle, 2.63 kg GI, 1.95 kg liver, 1.83 kg brain, 0.97 kg lungs and 8.48 kg other, totaling 67.1 kg of lean body mass. Fat would then be the difference between total body mass and lean body mass = 81.9 kg - 67. 1 kg = 14.8 kg or 18. 1 % fat, compared with a value of 20% fat in reference man (Table 1).

In each case, the kg of tissue per total g K, m2 of body surface, and cm of height appropriate to the age and sex of each individual subject were used in the calculation of body fat content as shown above.

The average deviation about the respective means was about ± 1% or ± 1.5 g K for the 6 men, ± 3% or ± 1.0 g K for the boy and ± 1% or ± 1.0 g K for the 7 women.

Percent fat in the total-body of reference humans as a function of age (data of Fig. 11 divided by data of Figure 2, converted to percent). This pattern of percent fat content varying with age and sex is similar to that reported by Slaughter et al. (1984). function of sex was discussed by Ljunggren (1965). We compare these results with values from the literature in the Appendix to this report. Among the healthy adults whose fat content we have determined by total- body counting using this model, women aged 18 to 59 years ranged between 15 and 56% fat, averaging 35.1% with a standard deviation of ± 9.4% (319 measurements of 141 individuals since 1968), 2 while men aged 18 to 84 years ranged between 6 and 43% fat, averaging 22.5 ± 8.5% (390 measurements of 188 individuals since 1967). 2 The difference between these means was signifi- cant (t = 18.8, P &lt; 0.001). Our population of men averaged 1.1 times the fat content of the reference adult man, and our population of women averaged 1.2 times the fat content of the reference adult woman. 2Data are also available on some of these individuals between 1962 and 1967, but a different human total-body counter was used, also described in Lloyd et al. (1979).</page><page sequence="13">A Model for Human Body Composition / 19 Table 2. Results of our Duplicate Determinations of Grams Total' Body Potassium (K) in Human Subjects Body K, grams ± S.D.

In comparison, those adult females whom we could identify as "athletic" or "fit" averaged 25.5% fat (0.89 of reference woman) with a mean MI of 1.08. Our adult male population of "average" body build had a mean fat content of 19.0% (0.95 of reference man) with a mean MI of 0.97. Those individuals identified as "thin" or "lean" averaged 14.5% fat (0.73 of reference man) with a mean MI of 0.91, while "runners" averaged 20.6% fat (1.03 times that of reference man) with a mean MI of 0.88.

MAYS content averaged 12.7 ± 9.5% (0.86 of reference) with a MI of 0.96 ± 0.11. For 10 measurements of 4 healthy juvenile females aged 8 to 15, the average fat content was 35. 7% (2.01 times that of the respective reference girls, but 5 of the 10 measurements were of a very obese individual over a period of a few years) with a mean MI of 0.89; 23 girls aged 5 to 17 years measured with the older equipment2 averaged 20.6 ± 10.6% fat (1. 18 of reference) with a MI of 0.91 ± 0.10. For 8 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Lloyd et al. 1973), the average calculated "fat" content was 43.7% with a MI of 0.57. However, when wasted muscle is replaced by fibrous connective tissue of low potassium concentration in the course of this disease, it can mistakenly be classified as fat by our method. Their individual Muscle Indices decreased from greater than 1.0 to about 0.23 with increasing disability. Five adult male subjects with various muscle diseases and aged 26 to 61 years averaged 38. 1% "fat" with a mean MI of 0.67. A 12 year old boy with myotonic muscular dystrophv contained 8.2% "fat" and had a MI of 0.93; his non-obese, 37 year old mother ( 169 cm, 66.6 kg) with more advanced myotonic muscular dystrophy had an indicated 51.1% "fat" with a MI of 0.55. A 29 year old, slender woman (171 cm, 58.8 kg) with limb- girdle muscular dystrophy, but still ambulatory, contained an indicated 48.9% "fat" and had a MI of 0.47. Several adult female subjects whose fat content had been estimated at our facility also had estimates made by water densitometry at one of two local laboratories (Table 3). In general, the estimates of indicated percent fat by gravimetric methods were lower than those obtained by 40K counting, perhaps because their values obtained by hydrostatic weighing may have been under- stood by the densitometry laboratories to be "excess" or "subcutaneous" fat rather than total fat as is implicit in our evaluation. For reasons explained elsewhere in this report, we believe that the gravimetric methods generally yielded estimates of total fat content that are too low. Comparison of our values with those of Laboratory "A" were of particular interest because both of these unmistakably slender young women had been classified as overfat by the densi- tometry laboratory. It was found that the body potassium concentration ( = C gK/kg) in our population of healthy adults appeared to be a function of age ( - A years). The empirical relationship for males derived by the method of least squares was C (male) = (2.23 ± 0.03) - (0.008397 ± 0.000766) A, and for females, it was C (female) = (1.81 ± 0.05) - (0.0 09168 ± 0.001347) A. The intercepts for these 2 equations were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.01), but the slopes were not (p&gt;0.20).

A dependence of K concentration upon age similar to that found in our population of healthy adults was reported for Hungarians by Andrasi and Beleznay (1979).

Cox and Shalaby (1981) reported corresponding age-related changes of po- tassium content in a British population. Discussion Once this model had been standardized and compared with the results in the literature, it seemed appropriate to apply it as a tool to monitor changes in persons who, for example, received medical or surgical treatment or whose clinical status changed for other reasons. We had the opportunity to study a</page><page sequence="16">22 / RAY D. LLOYD AND CHARLES W. MAYS group of adults who had been diagnosed by their physicians as morbidly obese and who were candidates for surgical intervention in their disease (Check 1982; Raymond et al. 1986). Although the calculated fat content in this group of 15 women ranged between 50% and 67%, averaging 56.5% (about twice that of reference women), their Muscle Index averaged 1.15. Similarly, the fat content in the group of 3 obese men ranged between 53 and 61%, averaging 56.0% (nearly 3 times that of reference man), with an average Muscle Index of 1.20. Relatively high values of the MI were common among obese individuals, sug- gesting that an increase in fat deposition is accompanied by the acquisition of extra muscle that is necessary to move the added weight about. A similar observation has been made by Pierson et al. (1974), who termed the extra potassium-containing tissue in obese subjects uexcess weight-obligated muscle" and defined it as skeletal muscle which is obligated by the presence of fat, and which requires muscle development to maintain physical mobility. Such obser- vations are not only true of groups of subjects but for individuals as well. The subjects studied by us following surgery for their morbid obesity lost weight, lost fat and lost muscle. For example, female subject CC, 35 years old, 159 cm and 107.5 kg just prior to treatment contained about 62 kg of fat (57.7%) and had a MI of 1.11. During the next 12 months, her weight had decreased to 53.3 kg, she contained 19.1 kg of fat (35.8%) and had a MI of 0.84. Male subject PS, 30 years old, 176 cm and 150 kg just before treatment contained about 79 kg of fat (53%) and had a MI of 1.23. During the next 12 months, his weight had decreased to 96.7 kg, he contained 36.6 kg of fat (37.9%) and had a MI of 1.03. In addition, some of the healthy subjects whose potassium content has been followed for a number of years have increased in body weight, fat content and Muscle Index. For example, female subject AF, 26 years old in 1979 and 170 cm, weighed 69.2 kg in December 1979, contained 23.4 kg of fat (33.8%) with a MI of 0.87. By June of 1983, her weight had increased to 115.3 kg, she contained 64.1 kg of fat (55.6%) and had a MI of 1.08. These observations appear to just be the inverse of the trends seen with the subjects who lost weight. The application of our body composition model and measurement tech- niques described herein enabled us to determine that in the first year after gastric partitioning for morbid obesity, both fat (adipose) and lean body mass (adipose- free mass) are lost, the proportions depending to some extent upon diet (Check 1982; Raymond et al. 1986). Corresponding results but without dietary informa- tion were reported by Palombo et al. (1981a, 1981b). We have monitored the effects upon body composition in patients with kidney disease of both dialysis and renal transplant and the effects in patients with liver disease of medical and surgical treatment (Schipke et al. 1985). The relationships between magnesium and potassium nutrition have been investigated in a group of diabetic patients and control subjects by in vivo counting of 40K and administered 28Mg, coupled with magnesium-loading and analysis of blood and excreta (Blackham 1980).</page><page sequence="17">A Model for Human Body Composition / 23 Conclusions« The model described herein appears to yield reasonable and reproducible values of percent body fat for populations and individual subjects. Moreover, the estimates of body fat made thereby seem to conform to corre- sponding estimates made by cadaver analysis. Serial measurements of an indi- vidual patient who is receiving relatively long-term treatment for a chronic disease (such as obesity, liver disease, kidney disease) can be particularly impor- tant in assessing effects of therapy on body composition.

Reports of body fat measurements. The literature on fat content of normal humans appears to fall naturally into two categories. Group A. Remenchic and Bernsohn (1963) found by 40K counting 1.8 to 46.2% fat in a group of adult males; middle-aged men studied by Chen et al. (1963) by anthropometry had 19% fat (Chinese) and 24% fat (Americans), while Chinese women had 27.6% fat. Behnke (1963) reported that "lean" individuals had 0.2 to 2.9% fat while "obese" subjects had 27. 1 to 34.0% fat by anthropometric measurement. In their series of subjects measured by water densitometry, Wang and Kou (1974) asserted that anyone with more than 20% fat was "obese". Thirty-eight "overweight" men reported by Clark et al. (1977) measured by water densitometry averaged 20% fat. Pierson et al. (1977) claimed that they found 29% fat in one "significantly obese" subject by anthropometric measurement and 12% in a "lean" subject. These values in Group A cluster around 20% to 40% fat in obese and about 5% to 20% in normal subjects. Group B. In contrast, Wang and Pierson (1976) found by isotopic dilu- tion, 40K counting and anthropometric measurements that normal subjects had 28% fat and obese subjects had 42.2% fat. Similar measurements by Pierson et</page><page sequence="22">28 / RAY D. LLOYD AND CHARLES W. MAYS al. (1982) led to a formula for percent body fat of 19.2 + 0.2 times the age in adult males (24.2% for age 25) and 27.5 + 0.096 times the age for adult females (29.9% for age 25). Five obese adult males averaged 52.5% fat and normal men averaged 35. 1% fat in a study by Pierson et al. (1976) done by 40K counting and isotope dilution. Steinkamp et al. (1965) reported 22 and 27% fat in Caucasian men aged 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 years, respectively, 31 and 37% fat in Caucasian women aged 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 years, respectively, and 23% fat in Black men aged 25 to 44 years, measured by anthropometric methods. 40K counting yielded 22% adipose in adult males and 35% adipose in adult females in a study by Anderson (1963). In adult males measured by 40K counting in a study by Aloia et al. (1978), 30 male marathon runners averaged 21.6% fat while 16 normal men had 29.5% fat. At age 25 and 65, respectively, normal adults measured by multiple isotope dilution were reported by Olesen (1965) to have 19.6% and 27.9% fat for males and 29.8% and 36.3% for females. Water densitometry measurements reported by Brozek (1968) yielded 16.5% fat for men and 27.7% fat for women. Young men had 20.6% fat and young women had 29.5% fat in a study by Krzywicki et al. (1968) using anthropometry, densitometry, isotopic dilution and 40K counting. Barber and Forbes (1963) reported 19.3% fat in adult males and 28.8% fat in adult females as measured by 40K counting and an- thropometric methods. Inert gas inhalation in adults measured 10.4 to 30.5% fat in males and 15.7 to 40.0% fat in females in a study by Lesser et al. (1963). Men had 11 to 30% fat (mean = 22%) and women had 28 to 44% fat (mean = 36%) as measured by Young et al. (1963) using skinfold thickness, body density and anthropometric methods. Colt et al. (1981) found 15% fat in lean marathon runners and 55% fat in obese adults by 40K counting and anthropometric mea- surements. Isotope dilution and values found in the literature led Friis-Hansen (1965) to conclude that 25 year old men average 20% fat, increasing to 32% at older ages, and 25 year old women average 30% fat, increasing to 40% at older ages. Mazess et al. (1984) found by photon absorption measurements that 4 men averaged 15.6% (7.8 to 27.4%) fat and 14 women averaged 32.3% (25.2 to 42.0%) fat. Widdowson et al. (1951) asserted that all measured healthy male subjects aged 20 to 40 years had more than 10% fat and nearly a quarter of them 40%. Thorland et al. (1984) reported about 10% fat in male and 17% fat in female adolescent athletes by skinfold and gravimetric measurements. Mukher- jee and Roche (1984) obtained values of 19.7% fat in men and 28.4% fat in women by modeling techniques. The studies in this group indicate about 20% fat in normal young adult men and 30% in normal young adult women, with values in particularly fit individuals that are somewhat lower and those in obese persons that are considerably higher. Comparison of Groups A and B with other data. It has been reported that very thin women of reproductive age lose or do not begin the menses if they do</page><page sequence="23">A Model for Human Body Composition / 29 not maintain their body fat content in excess of a required minimum value (Warren 1980). Frisch and McArthur (1974) claimed that a value of 22% fat indicates a lower limit necessary for the restoration or maintenance of menstrual cycles for women of ages 16 years and over. They asserted that the evidence suggests that this represents a minimum level of stored, easily mobilized energy that is necessary for ovulation and menstruation in the human female. This finding of 22% has been disputed by Loucks et al. (1984), but the conflict among investigators may have been a function of their respective fat determina- tion methods. It seems likely that normal, healthy women may require some minimum percentage of fat for normal function, however. This suggests that normal young women whose total body fat is estimated at about 20% are proba- bly not overfat and tends to support the studies in Group B. Based on results from cadaver studies (see following section), at least some of the measured fat content values reported in Group "A" among the studies cited in a previous section of this Appendix probably were too low. The defini- tion of "fat" also is not constant from study to study, and this may contribute to nonuniformity of results. Anderson (1963) remarked that his term "adipose" encompassed all fat including some that was considered as a part of lean body mass by other investi- gators. Lesser and Zak (1963) claimed that "lean body mass" includes about 10% "essential fat." This agrees with the definition of lean body mass by Moore et al. (1963) as the fat-free body plus some essential lipids and with that of Edelstein (1977) as bones, muscles, organs and essential fat. Behnke (1963) stated that the adipose-free mass includes an undetermined but probably constant propor- tion of essential lipids in bone marrow, the central nervous system and other organs, and Forbes et al. (1953) found "additional fat" in the skeleton and skeletal muscle of a cadaver. Other investigators specify adipose-free or fat-free mass (Pierson et al. 1976; Krzywicki and Consolazio 1968; Wang and Pierson 1976; Widdowson 1965; Haschke et al. 1981; Ljunggren 1965) or are silent about their precise definition. Comparison of indirect methods with cadaver analysis. Because cadaver studies are the only direct methods for fat analysis and since there have been only a few cadavers that have had the fat content determined, the results should be described in detail. Of the cadavers analysed for fat content in this and the preceding century (Widdowson 1965; Clarys et al. 1984), the woman (aged 42) studied by Widdowson was described as a thin, masculine type and had 23.6% fat; 6 men (aged 25 to 60) had up to 27.3% fat, and a 4 year old boy had 22.7% fat. One other 70 kg adult of unspecifed sex had 18.0% fat. A few comments about the individual subjects are instructive. Widdowson et al. (1951) remarked on the female cadaver that she appeared so thin and weighed only "... 7 stone ..." (45 kg) but had 23.6% fat. These authors were amazed at the low</page><page sequence="24">30 / RAY D. LLOYD AND CHARLES W. MAYS value that they obtained of 1.1% in their subject "S" and claimed (seemingly incredulously) that this value must constitute a physiological record. Wid- dowson (1965) felt that a completely fat-free body is incompatible with life and asserted that it is probable that even the most undernourished person still contains about 4% fat. The cadaver reported by Mitchell et al. (1945) was said to be 11% underweight by actuarial tables but contained an initial estimate of 12.5% fat (a revised estimate was 19.3%). Forbes et al. (1953) reported another subject to have been 23% underweight for his height and age and was charac- terized as "moderately thin" but contained 19.4% fat. Only about 6.5% fat was found in a lean 48 year old male (Forbes and Lewis 1956) of 169 cm and 62.0 kg, while a 25 year old male 179 cm and 71.8 kg was 14.9% fat. Clarys et al. (1984) reviewed the 19th and 20th century literature con- cerning cadaver analysis for body fat and gave information on an additional 25 dissections made recently in their Brussels laboratory. The data prior to the year 1901 included a female at 28.3% fat and males at 11.1%, 14.4% and 18. 1% fat. Results for 12 adult male cadavers in the Brussels study ranged between 17.8% and 32.7%, averaging 28.1%, while corresponding results for 13 adult female cadavers ranged between 28.6% and 54.1%, averaging 40.5%. Clarys et al. obtained circumference and skinfold thickness measurements and weights in air and under water on their subjects prior to dissection. They concluded that their data cast doubt upon the in vivo estimation of body fat in humans by an- thropometry or gravimetric methods. The 25 subjects they used tended toward obesity and are not necessarily representative of the adult population (they excluded cadavers that were emaciated or that showed evidence of physical abnormality or deterioration). The authors concluded that at least some of the subjects analysed by other investigators had shown evidence of poor nutritional state at death so that these subjects might be expected to have had an indicated fat content somewhat lower than that to be found in a healthy population, population.</page></plain_text>
