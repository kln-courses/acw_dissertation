<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME PROBLEMS RAISED BY HISTORICAL RELATIVISM 23 and scientific method is virtually a condition precedent. The record reveals that only those scholars hostile to logic have derogated reason and sought refuge in the particular; only those scientists wary of metaphysics have exalted "pure fact" and transformed empiricism into a credo; only those social students, aping scientific procedures mistakenly conceived, have made the very phrase "value judgment" a term of scorn and have placed value itself under a scientific ban. Logic, scientific method, psy- chology, and metaphysics are the true auxil- iaries of the historical discipline. Only scholars more concerned with prestige than with under- standing will question who is auxiliary to whom. Relativism has made value theory crucial to the success of historical scholarship. A hallowed principle of the historian's creed and a cardinal assumption of all learning must therefore be re- appraised; its opposite must be restored to a level of respectability suflicient at least to make it entertainable. Given value judgments, what kinds of meanings can the historical search yield? What levels of insights and meanings are realizable? What are the limits imposed by the nature of the materials and the nature of the historian which thereby condition the nature of the quest? The unexamined life is as worthless to the historian as to the philosopher. Both examine the compelling issues of existence, albeit on dif- ferent levels, in response to the deepest inner drives as well as in response to the deepest cul- tural drives. But neither historians nor philos- ophers can afford to "become contemporary students of the past rather than historically- minded students of the present."23 In the very 23 SEARS, loc. cit., p. 148. But the plea of Sears, a persistent theme of scholars if not of scholarship, does not answer the classical objections, given classic form in modern times by COHEN ("Phi- losophy in wartime an apologia," Faith of a liberal, pp. 84-92), that the scholar best serves society by remaining aloof from its most insistent problems. But no one has answered the questions "When" or act of examination both are making history in the act of reconstructing it, for the reconstruc- tion provides the clues to a newer past. If philosophers continue to ask "Why" long after others have ceased to do so, the historian is forced by the very nature of history constantly to review human values, to redefine human aspirations in the cold light of the possible, and to reformulate the grounds upon which they rest. History, as Ernest Cassirer said, is funda- mentally and irrevocably "anthropomorphic" and "to efface its human aspects would be to destroy its specific character and nature."24 For the historian the owl of Minerrra does not fly at twilight; the historian must always labor under the smarting rays of the sun, and what- ever the earthly metaphor, it is a physical fact that the sun never sets. This, in the stimulating words of John Dewey, is "a plea for the casting off of that intellectual timidity which hampers the wings of the imagination, a plea for speculative audacity, for more faith in ideas, [for] sloughing off a cowardly reliance upon those partial ideas which we are wont to give the name of facts."25 SARAH LAWRENCE COLLEGE "How much." Scant help is afforded by the dictum that, "in the last analysis," it is a matter of indi- vidual temperament. Perhaps it might not be un- wise to attack the problem frontally once again. What are the uses of knowledge; what is knowledge for? 24 E. CASSIRER, Essay on man (New Haven, I944), p. I9I- 25 J. DEWEY, Philosophy and civilization (New York, I93I), p. I2. The query propounded in the Report "What do we do now and how?" a ques- tion formulated in this instance by BEARD (P. 5), and one repeatedly asked since the beginning of scholarly self-examination, seems to me to be the most important statement in the book. It need hardly be said that the question cannot be answered without standards of import and value; and, if the more extreme views of relativism are granted, it cannot be answered at all. RELATIX7TSM AND THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS IN HISTORY WILLSON H. COATES A LTHOUGH Loewenberg is obviously not in- diSerent to the philosophical obligations of historians, he has, it is clear, been concerned in this inquiry with what historians actually do. This is indeed a philosophical question and one with which the professional philosopher is occu- pied.I It is the kind of philosophical question which, because of doubts about the authenticity of historical knowledge, cannot with impunity x Among many American philosophers evidently concerned with this question in their writings are Morris R. Cohen, John Dewey, Maurice Mandel-</page><page sequence="2">WILLSON H. COATES 24 while they severely depreciate the objectivity of the historian's product, they do not advocate abandoning those techniques which have been designed to achieve objectivity. They inherit, moreover, from the scientific historians whom they attack, a disdain for value judgments, al- though their own view reduces history to a multitude of subjective judgments of the past. When the relativists have had their say, what is the status of historical knowledge? Its objectivity is not unimpaired, but it is still re- spectable. Once we have stamped finality as the great heresy for scholars, we can see the concept of the relativity of knowledge as a movement in the direction of greater objectivity. In other words, the relativists, by successfully challeng- ing the "objectivity" of the history written by those who claimed to be following Ranke's famous dictum ("wie es eigentlich gewesen"), put history in a philosophic perspective which is a nearer approach to the objectivity which they deny is possible.4 Furthermore, contempla- tion of the intrinsic character of historical and scientific knowledge and of the comparable relativism in modern physics has served to ele- vate historical knowledge above the lowly place to which the relativists consigned it.5 Much of what goes to make up historical evidence is of such an authentic character that the historian, employing his rational faculties and canons of logical inference sanctified by the scientist's use, can be betrayed no more than the scientist con- 4 I recall the particular cogency with which Ed- win Van de Walle led students to the recognition of this paradoxical contribution of the relativists. 5 The inferior standing of historical knowledge as conceived by the relativists is apparent in two clas- sic statements of their position-Carl BECKER, "Everyman his own historian," American historical review, XXXVII (I932), 22I-36; and Charles BEARD, "Written history as an act of faith," Ameri- can historical review, XXXIX (I934), 2I9-29. It should be pointed out, however, that Charles Beard and Carl Becker were subsequently, if not at the time of publication of these essays, fully aware of the comparable status of scientific knowledge. As another relativist historian, Crane BRINTON, has put it, the historian no longer needs to feel that "the uncertainties and inaccuracies of his investi- gations leave him in a position of hopeless inferiority before the glorious certainties of physical science" ("The 'new history' and 'past everything,"' Ameri- can scholar, VIII [I939], I53; cf. Emery NEFF, The poetry of history [New York, I947], pp. 202-I2). be slighted by the historian even if he agrees with George Burton Adams that it is more im- portant to ascertain facts than to yield to the "allurements of speculation."2 Since I908, when this was asserted by Adams, the line between speculation and fact has become indistinct, and even those historians who are metaphysically incurious and who are eager to get on with the business of their craft find the subject of the presuppositions inherent in their professional activity too insistent to ignore. That in this sense the age of philosophic innocence for historians has passed was shown by J. H. Randall, Jr., and George Haines IV in the Social Science Research Council report on Theory and practice in historical study.3 All this has been implied or taken for granted by Loewenberg in his critique of historical relativ- ism. With his analysis I am in such substantial agreement that my minor deviations are scarce- ly worth setting down. I propose, therefore, in- stead of a point-by-point discussion of his paper, to reformulate a brief critique of rela- tivism and to probe into one of the chief problems it raises-that of the use of hypothesis in history. It is the relativists, indeed, who have been leading contributors to the philosophic matur- ing of historians, but they have not been free from grave inconsistencies. The maturing has come from looking with a healthy skepticism at the presumed solidity of the "scientific" his- torian's facts; but, being for the most part excel- lent practitioners of the historian's skills and retaining as they do a lively curiosity for his- torical knowledge, the relativists have instinc- tively stopped short of the total and unhealthy skepticism to which their criticisms point; for baum, Arthur E. Murphy, and J. H. Randall, Jr. I have found in my teaching association with phi- losopher-colleagues (Alfred H. Jones, Julius Kraft, Robert J. Trayhern, and the late Edwin W. Van de Walle) that they have as a starting-point of philo- sophical inquiry in this field, a lively interest in what historians do. 2 American historical review, XIV (I909), 236. B. J. LOEWENBERG on another occasion has said: "Historians need not become philosophers, but they must be aware of the logical consequences of philosophical committments" (The history of ideas: I935-I945 [New York, I947], p. I3)- 3 (New York, I946), pp. 27 and 50-52.</page><page sequence="3">RELATIVISM AND THE USE OF HYPOTESIS IN HISTORY 25 fronted with his evidence.6 The relativists point to the historian's inenritable predilections but they have, by their own continued use of those research methods whose inadequacy they ex- pose, left unshaken the professional pride which induces a historian faced by stubborn source material to modify his preconceptions.7 The foregoing comments on relativism do not diverge from Loewenberg's views in the fundamental position taken-a position which eschews both the extreme skepticism implied in historical relativism about objective historical knowledge and the scientiSc dogmatism against which that relativism was a protest. The point of view here assumed is that a vast body of his- torical knowledge arrived at by highly refined methods of verification, may be characterized as true, pending evidence to the contrary. We fall short of certainty, we assume fallibility, not only because of the fragmentary or unreliable character of historical sources but also because, in reconstructing the past, we have need of hypotheses. The extent to which historians necessarily 6 This statement would not in practice be con- tested by the relativists. For example, in his Prog- ress and power (Stanford University, I935), Carl BECKER accepts material progress as fully de- monstrable. Every historian can point to some in- contestable conclusions, as distinguished from de- batable ones, based on historical sources. Even unreliable historical sources may inadvertently reveal incontrovertible facts about the authors of those sources and therefore about the period in which they wrote. Underlying the logical inferences used for this kind of authentic history may be empirical hypotheses such as are discussed below. 7 One facet of professional pride may be fear of censure by one's colleaguest but this pride clearly exists. J. H. HEXTER in his review of W. A. Orton, The liberal tradition (American historical rez)iew, LI II946], 487), says: "He does tricks with the past repugnant to anyone who feels that history is no easy bought mistress bound to suit her ways to the intellectual appetites of the current customer." Maurice MANDELBAUM, one of the most effective champions of the historical profession against the relativist assault, writes: "It is neither hyperbole nor metaphor to say that in any investigation we are led from one fact to another. In that process . . . even our socially conditioned attitudes may under- go radical transformations" ("Causal analysis in history," Journal of the history of ideas, III [I942], 37). Cf. also Arthur O. LovEJoY, "Present stand- points and past history," Journal of philosophy, XXXVI (I939), 477-89. use hypotheses has been clarified in recent years by philosophers and is widely recognized by historians.8 Many of these hypotheses, implied or explicit, are a part of that empirical knowl- edge which everyone employs in the daily busi- ness of living and come from all fields of learn- ing. Historians, no matter what may be the con- flicting views on the problem of causality, take for granted, like everyone else, some kind of interdependence between events.9 On the gen- erally accepted assumption that scientific laws are operative whether or not they are recog- nized, historians do not admit at its face value testimony that is clearly contrary to the find- . r ngs ot sclence. These and innumerable examples drawn from the practice of historiansI° would reveal many different varieties of hypotheses which 8 See n. II below. Examples of elucidations by philosophers are chaps. xvii and xviii in Morris R. COHEN and Ernest NAGEL, An Introductson to logic and scientific ethod (New York, I934); Morris R. C OHEN, 'sCausation and its application to history," Jogrnal of the history of ideas, III (I942), I2-29; MANr)ELsAulw, loc. cit., PP. 30-50; Carl G. HEMPEL, "The function of general laws in history," JournaG of philosophy, XXXIX (I942), 35-48; and Philip P. WIENER, "On methodology in the philosophy of history," Journal of phiZosophy, XXXVIII (I94I), 309-24. 9 It is clear from his succinct and humorous treatment of historical "causes" (Progress and power, pp. vii-ix), as well as from his other historical writ- ings, that Carl BECKER accepted this working hypothesis. MANDELBAUM extends the hypothesis when he says: "That in actual practice the historian holds relations between events to be objectively ascertainable, and that the element of interpreta- tion which is present in his work is held by him to be dictated by these facts of relationship, seem to me to be beyond question" (ZOC. Ci{., P. 37). Cf. Morris COREN'S terse statement that "no connec- tion between facts is purely man-made" (The rnean- ing of history [Lasalle, Il1., I947], P. 33). I°Two further examples will serve. Presuming that inaccurate reports of unusual occurrences will tend toward exaggeration rather than toward under- statement, historians place their reliance on the most restrained account. On the hypothesis that a person conforms to patterns of thought and con- duct throughout life, historians are constantly identifying sources or making assertions about his- torical figures (see, e.g., the discussion of John Pym in Wallace NOTESTEIN, Frances RELF, and Hartley SIMPSON, Commons debates I62I [New Haven, I935]} I, 26-62).</page><page sequence="4">26 WILLSON H. COATES are now regarded as empirically indisputable. Because of this quality, such hypotheses, per- haps more accurately called "underlying as- sumptions," are usually tacitly employed and unquestioningly acquiesced in. The hypotheses which are more likely to be exposed as hy- potheses are the disputable ones, and it is these whose use for the historian is in need of present analysis. The differentiation of one type of hypothesis from another needs to be clariSed. Distinctions between implicit and explicit, unassailable and debatable, legitimate and illegitimate, are in- adequate though suggestive, and they do not throw light on the value to the historian of hy- potheses of the controvertible type. From the use of this kind of hypothesis no historian is or can be free, although historians differ in their awareness of their particular frames of refer- ence.II Controlling assumptions such as those about progress, nationalism, Christianity, or political parties may not be consciously de- wveloped into philosophies of history as they were by Hegel, Comte, or Pareto, but every historian has a philosophy of history no matter how insipid or self-contradictory it may turn out to be if explicitly stated. A full-fledged philosophy of history may be regarded as the prototype of the kind of hypothesis we are exploring. Hypotheses of this category, it has been sug- gested, are distinguished from the empirically verifiable ones in that their exponents present them as underlying or all-embracing laws regulating history.I2 Such a distinction may become blurred when we observe that, in an attenuated form and for certain relation- ships, what was originally presented as a com- prehensive historical law, such as the dialectic of Hegel or the class struggle of Marx, may in time be accepted as a part of our common-sense knowledge. The distinction, nevertheless, is use- ful, while its blurred outlines suggest that no matter how inhospitable the historian may be to II In this connection Sidney HOOK'S definitions of "fact" and "frame of reference" (Theory and practice in historical study [NewYork, I946], pp. I 23- 27) are very helpful See also the chapter by J H. RANDALL, Jr., and George HAINES IV on "Con- trolling assumptions," and the "Propositions" (par- ticularly IV, VI, VII, VIII, and XVI) drawn up by Thomas C COCHRAN and Louis GOTTSCHALB (ibid., pp I7-52, I35, and I38)- I2 Maurice MANDELBAU1W, "Can there be a phi- losophy of history?" American scholar,IX (I940),83. philosophies of history he does not escape from their insinuating influence. It is well for the his- torian to be disciplined in skepticism toward general historical laws and to be fully aware of the difference between the use of hypothesis by himself and its use by the scientist. But the historian cannot, even if he would, adopt a rigidly Baconian view of his proper function as an inductive thinker. Not only have the in- sights provided by general and empirically un- supported theories pointed to new relationships of historical events, relationships which the his- torian comes to accept, but they have also opened his eyes to facts hidden in familiar sources and turned his attention to sources previously overlooked. The Hegelian and the Marxian interpretations of history are only two of many instances where the sharpened focus of an exclusive theory has given new vision to the historian.I3 If, then, general hypotheses applied to his- tory are at once suspect to the historian and productive of new knowledge for him, the ques- tion which should be asked is not whether philosophies of history, unmanageable as they are for a fully scientific test, should be dis- paraged altogether, but whether and how they can be brought under some kind of disciplined use. The answer may not be so satisfactory as that which the scientist would give for his field but it does not, for the historian, lie in a greater approximation to the methods of science. The reasons for this are many and familiar, but there is one that, for the purposes of our present inquiry, is particularly worth exploring. A hypothesis, for both scientist and philosopher- historian, may be first conceived in an intuitive flash, but the philosopher-historian, in a sense I3 "His way of arranging things (like any other way of arranging things) is valuable because it gives us insights which otherwise we might have missed connections which otherwise we might never have noted" (Kemp MALONE, "Grundtvig's Philosophy of history," Journal of the history of ideas, I [I940], 283). This is true also of those biases which are not necessarily formulated into philosophies of history. Our knowledge, for example, of seventeenth-century England would be the poorer were it not for both the Clarendons and the Macaulays. "Had it not been for the nationalist movement in Germany in the early Igth century," R. L. SCHUYLER, points out "the great mass of material that is to be found in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica would not have been made available to students" ("Some his- torical idols," Political science qal,arterly, XLVII [I932], 7 8).</page><page sequence="5">RELATIVISM AND THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS IN HISTORY 27 apart from the essential digging into sources, historical knowledge has actually expanded. Let us admit that, although there are historians like F. W. Maitland who combine with a self- critical faculty a rare gift for discerning new historical relationships, the historian usually, by professional training if not by temperament, is out of the running as a philosopher of history on a grand scale. His role in relation to the speculative systems, whether they are fruitful or barren for him, is both critical and eclectic. If he is without arrogance and an immoderate need for certainty, he can acknowledge the acuity in discoveries he could not himself have made and at the same time see the distortions in the discoverer's vision.I6 What appears to be an anarchy of competing and mutually exclu- sive insights into history can be resolved by the historian into an orderly division of labor among the community of scholars.I7 The critical func- tion of the historian, being essentially a rational one, is a way for him to enlist in the service of reason those super- or subintellectual philoso- phies of history produced by poetic, erudite, and antirational minds.I8 Underlying this view of the historian's func- tion, which can be maintained in spite of the measure of disagreement that actually prevails on almost any important historical problem, there is probably a fundamentally rationalist as- sumption. Is it not, like the assumption of an orderly universe by the scientists, essential to the pursuit of knowledge itself? UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER I6 For a good example of this kind of approach see J. H. HEXTER'S review of Karl Polanyi, The great transformation (American historical review, L [ I945], 50I-4) - I7 It is not contended that any philosophy of his- tory, no matter how fantastic, is as rewarding to the historian as any other or even that it must yield some useful insights. But it is important to note that "the complexity of the subject matter of human history is so great that comprehensive theories which are believed to be opposed to one another are in fact merely supplementary" (COHEN and NAGEL, pp. 342-43). I8 At one point in his Uses of reason (New York, I943) Arthur E. MURPHY would seem to contest this view by saying that "no insight, however im- mediately luminous or urgent, which can maintain itself only through exclusion of what is elsewhere, and reliably, found to be true, is worthy of philo- sophic acceptance" (p. 30I). But I should interpret his book as a whole (see, e.g., pp. 337-38) as lending support to the view here presented. not applicable to the scientist, adheres to his hypothesis as an article of faith, employing it not only as a means of ordering facts but also as a device for abrogating other facts. The trans- mutation of a hypothesis into an exclusive theory of historical knowledge is common pro- cedure to expositors of philosophies of history in all varieties from the materialistic to the idealistic. It is, indeed, very doubtful whether a hypothesis applied to history as it is in science merely for purposes of trial and investigation could yield that full insightof which itis capable when it is the deep conviction of an original mind.t4 The penetration to new historical facts and relationships seems to come from a com- bination of an intuitive and "unscientific" ap- proach to historical phenomena with a merciless convergence of the philosopher's critical powers upon all rival systems of thought.IS This is not, however, a reason for pleading that historians should get themselves a faith if they want to have historical insight. If a plea wis necessary, it is for a fuller recognition of how, I4 Edward W. STRONG ("Fact and understanding in history," Journal of philosophy, XLIV [I947], 624) makes a distinction between the "testing of an hypothesis" in Charles A. Beard's A n economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States and Oswald Spengler's DecIine of the West which is "written to a thesis." Although I should willingly place Beard above Spengler as a reliable historian, I doubt whether Strong's distinction is significant, for both Beard and Spengler wrote from conviction. Similarly, Toynbee may be placed well above Spengler as a historian on the grand scale. (As Beard himself put it, he "makes Spengler look like a petty sciolist.") Indeed, one has the feeling that Toynbee, unlike Spengler, is really trying to subject his historical laws to empirical tests and that he would have the integrity and the modesty, if given sufficient reason, to modify or abandon his laws. Nevertheless, it is quite evident that there is con- victionbehindToynbee'spresentation of hislaws, and the sllfiicient reasonsfor abandoning them, universal history being more tractab]e than science, are not likely to arise for him. For another view of Toyn- bee see Oscar HANDLIN, "In the dark backward," Partisan review, XIV (July-August I947), 37I-79, I5 The analysis here presented is not completely contradicted by, though it is somewhat at vari- ance with, MANDELBAU1W in his "Can there be a philosophy of history?" (loc. cit ). He says that philosophies of history "present us with what are at best disparate insights" and that they "yield knowledge neither of fact nor of moral validity" (ibid., PP. 78 and 84), Cf also his "A critique of philosophies of history," Journal of philosophy, XLV (I948), 365-78-</page></plain_text>
