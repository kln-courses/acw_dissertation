A recent reviewer said her accomplishments include the creation of a new field in ancient studies, the investigation of ancient gardens. Professor Jashemski received her B.A. summa cum laude in Latin from York College in York, Nebraska, in 1931 and her M.A. in ancient history and classics from the University of Nebraska in 1933. She started her teaching career at Indiana Central College in Indianapolis (1935-1940) and at Lindenwood College in St. Charles, Missouri (1942-1945).Jashemski completed her education withJ.A.O. Larson at the University of Chicago where she received her Ph.D. in 1942. In Chicago she met her husband, the physicist Stanley Jashemski. Her disser- tation, The Origins and History of the Proconsular and Propraetorian Imperium to 27 B.C., was published in 1950 by the University of Chicago Press and reprinted in 1966 by "L'ERMA" di Bretschneider in their Studia Historica series. Professor Jashemski taught at the University of Maryland at College Park from 1946 to 1980 and since that time has been Professor Emerita. She was named Outstanding Woman on the University of Maryland Campus in 1980 and Distinguished Scholar-Teacher in 1982. After a well-received dissertation in Roman constitutional history, she turned her attention toward Roman gardens. The study of ancient gardens sounded like too much fun to be serious scholarship, but after discus- sions with her husband in their own garden in Silver Spring, she undertook a preliminary investigation and discovered that little had been done in this field. In 1961 she was granted permission to excavate at Pompeii- an opportunity rarely given to foreign scholars. She located and cleared the root cavities of ancient plants and poured and excavated casts of these trees, bushes, and smaller plants. Later the plants were identified and in many cases replanted in their original settings in the houses and villas of Pompeii. Publication of her research on ancient gardens has ranged from the delightful Letters from Pompeii, written to explain her work to her nieces and nephew, to the monumental two-volume The Gardens of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and the Villas Destroyed by Vesuvius, which appeared in 1979 and 1993. High among priorities for publication were the won- derful color photographs of the gardens and the garden paintings taken by her husband, Stanley. Three ad- ditional books are completed and waiting at the publishers: Wild Flowers amid the Ruins: Greece and Pompeii; Medicinal Plants at Pompeii: A Pompeiian Herbal; and The Natural History of Pompeii and Other Vesuvian Sites, edited papers from a working symposium of specialists from many disciplines. She has currently returned to the first book she planned in this field, a survey of gardens of the Roman empire. WilhelminaJashemski directed the University of Maryland excavations at Pompeii, Boscoreale, and Oplontis from 1961 to 1983. In addition she has dug at Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli (1987-1988) and at Thuburbo Maius in Tunisia (1990). When she started excavating gardens there were few, if any, colleagues in the same field, a problem apparent when she first organized an international colloquium on "Ancient Roman Gardens" in 1979. This colloquium was followed by another on "Ancient Roman Villa Gardens" in 1984. Both are published in the Dumbarton Oaks series. She has organized five international conferences to date and continues to edit those contributions for publication. As a result of her tireless efforts both in the field and organizing these international meetings, there is now a new generation of young scholars excavating and studying ancient gardens. ProfessorJashemski's love for teaching, field archaeology, and all aspects of life in ancient Pompeii is reflected in the wide range of dissertations produced under her direction and the dedication of a cadre of former stu- dents whose careers she has continued to follow and influence. Evidence of this appreciation is obvious in the two-volume festschrift Studia Pompeiana et Classica in Honor of Wilhelmina EJashemski (New Rochelle 1989). Throughout WilhelminaJashemski's teaching career and in the years since retirement from the classroom, her home and garden have served as the meeting point of friends and colleagues from around the world. Former students and their families, young excavators of gardens from all areas of the ancient Roman empire, and col- leagues interested in ancient history, archaeology, and landscape design continue to receive advice and criti- cism and to enjoy her friendship. For all these reasons, the Archaeological Institute of America is proud to present the Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement to Wilhelmina F. Jashemski.</page><page sequence="3">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 333 POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY W. DAVID KINGERY The Archaeological Institute of America is proud to present the 16th Pomerance Award for Scientific Con- tributions to Archaeology to W. David Kingery, Regents Professor of Anthropology and of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Arizona. The award is made in recognition of his pathbreaking studies in the history of ceramics and his notable contributions as a writer and an editor to our understanding of technological innovation and the social context of technology in the past. Dr. Kingery received his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1949 and rapidly became the leading figure in the development of high-performance ceramics for modern technology. His interest in past technologies was kindled by his distinguished M.I.T. colleague Cyril Stanley Smith (the recipient of the 1982 Pomerance Award), and no one has done more to expand upon Smith's crucial insight that many major tech- nological advances were initially developed to satisfy aesthetic desires rather than economic need. Dr. Kingery and the British archaeometrist Michael Tite, working independently, were largely responsible for applying electron microscopy to the study of ancient ceramics, plasters, refractories, glasses, and glazes. His work has transformed our understanding of the origins of pyrotechnology in the Neolithic period in the Near East, while his many articles and his book Ceramic Masterpieces (1986; co-authored with his former student Pamela Vandiver) have enhanced our understanding of, and pleasure in, the fine ceramics of Classical Greece, China, and the European Renaissance. Dr. Kingery has also shaped the study of ancient technology through his role as an organizer of many con- ferences and as an editor of numerous books. He has edited six volumes to date in the series Ceramics and Civilization, published by the American Ceramic Society. He has also brought together scholars from many fields to share their ideas on the social interpretation of material objects and landscapes. These conferences resulted in the volumes History from Things (1993; co-edited with Steven Lubar) and Learning from Things (1996). Professor Kingery's accomplishments have enriched archaeology, art history, and the history of technology, and have profound implications for our understanding of the role of technology, technological innovation, and technology transfer in past societies. In recognition of his many contributions to archaeology, and in cele- bration of his 70th birthday, we take pleasure in bestowing upon W. David Kingery the 1996 Pomerance Award.</page><page sequence="4">334 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD LEONARD V. QUIGLEY Since 1978 the name of Leonard V. Quigley has appeared continuously with the list of members of the Gov- erning Board of the Archaeological Institute of America. During his long service as General Counsel of the Institute he has seen six Presidents come and go. Yet of all the officers, Len Quigley is little known to the general membership. For this reason the time is long overdue to recognize Len Quigley's immense contribution to the well-being of the Archaeological Institute of America by awarding him its Award for Distinguished Service. Following a long and honorable tradition of voluntary service, which belies the low esteem in which the legal profession is currently held, Leonard Quigley accepted the Institute's invitation in 1978 to become its General Counsel. In doing so he placed his vast knowledge of the law and the resources of his office at the disposal of the Institute free of charge. Though not without a keen amateur interest in archaeology before committing himself to the AIA, Len's decision to accept the challenge was prompted as much by his sense of adventure and his friendly spirit. A graduate of the College of the Holy Cross (B.A. 1953), Leonard Quigley received his professional training at Harvard Law School (LL.B. magna cum laude 1959) and at New York Uni- versity Law School where he specialized in international law (LL.M. 1962). He has served most of his legal career with the illustrious New York City firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, of which he is a partner and leader of the Canadian practice. During his legal career Len has fulfilled many demanding responsibilities, notably in the fields of corporate law, international law, and in the North American Free Trade Agreement. His membership in both the American and Canadian Bar Associations is an especially appropriate reflection of the AIA's recognition of its own international nature in the recent establishment of AIA-Canada. If the contrast between the high-powered universe of international trade that Len inhabits during the week and the leisurely academic world of the AIA must on occasion bring a smile to Len Quigley's face, there is never the slightest hint that in his pro bono handling of its legal affairs the AIA is any less deserving of his attention than his far grander, paying clients. Like a good physician, Len is always on call, whether to offer an informal legal opinion during the deliberations at Governing Board and Executive Committee meetings or to cast a critical eye over some sensitive document. In the past five years alone, for example, Len Quigley has reviewed draft after draft of the latest major revision of the bylaws, scrutinized the personnel policies that regulate conditions of employment for the staff at AIA headquarters and in the office of Archaeology Magazine, engaged experts from his firm to draw up the contracts for the Archaeology television series and for the mono- graph and colloquia series, defined the legal status of the Institute's endowments and restricted funds, and maintained a watching brief over the evolving formulation of the Code of Professional Standards. These ac- tivities may seem remote from the stated mission of the AIA, but their careful execution is essential in pro- viding a stout shield against the threat of expensive litigation with all its debilitating and distracting conse- quences. That an organization with a public profile as high as that of the AIA and with a magazine that does not eschew controversy continues to enjoy freedom from legal suits is due in no small measure to the vigilance of our General Counsel and the powerful authority he commands through the reputation of the firm he serves. Leonard Quigley, the AIA recognizes with profound gratitude the outstanding service that you and your colleagues at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison have rendered the cause of archaeology over the past 18 years. We thank you for the sage advice and expert legal counsel you have provided in abundance and pro bono. We appreciate your patience and good humor in handling your sometimes exasperating clients. Above all we cherish your friendship, warm humanity, and puckish sense of fun. The Archaeological Institute of America is proud to present the Distinguished Service Award as a token of its gratitude for sharing with us your professional skills so generously to our great benefit.</page><page sequence="5">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 335 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA EXCELLENCE IN UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING AWARD FREDERICK A. COOPER Frederick A. Cooper of the University of Minnesota is the 1996 recipient of the Archaeological Institute of America's Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award. It is fitting that Professor Cooper be the first re- cipient of this new award. He has been teaching undergraduate students for over 33 years at a major research university, a duty he could have easily turned over to younger colleagues. He teaches a wide range of subjects, from general introductory courses in art history to specialized seminars in classical archaeology, to a wide range of students from many disciplines. Deeply committed to the teaching of archaeology, he continues to bring new methods, disciplines, and technologies into both the classroom and the field. His letters of support and syllabi are a testament to his intellectual energy, tireless enthusiasm, and visionary pedagogical skills. Professor Cooper's contributions to undergraduate education have been recognized by his University with three teaching awards- the maximum number one professor can receive. They span the length of his career- University of Minnesota-College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Teaching Awards were presented in 1972-1973 and 1989-1990 and the Morse-Minnesota Alumni Award for Outstanding Contributions to Undergraduate Education was awarded in 1991. In addition to using his award money to finance undergraduate research proj- ects, he has helped students raise their own funds to pursue their ideas. According to his departmental chair, Fred Cooper and his students have set a record in the University's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program for receiving the most grants and awards for their research initiatives. One of his most enduring achievements as a teacher has been in the field. Fred Cooper has trained hundreds of students on his field projects in Greece: the Bassai Project, which, beginning in the late 1960s, has provided apprenticeships in architecture for students at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and for numerous aspiring architects from Europe and the United States; the three-year-long Nemea Reconstruction Project; his restudy of the palace and environs at Pylos; his expeditions in the Mani to find ancient quarries; his environmental surveys using satellite spectral data and GIS; and his study of Greek vernacular architecture. No matter what their primary academic interest, Fred Cooper taught his students the fundamentals of hands-on archaeological field work, including both traditional methods and new technologies. Participants in his projects stress the unique and heady brew of intellectual and cultural experience that Fred Cooper provides. One writes: "He teaches by the example of his life, and it is his unhesitating and close collaboration with the Belgians and the Germans and the Greeks, with geologists and architects and botanists, that provides his students rich lessons in the value of interdisciplinary effort and internationalism for the ac- complishment of intellectual goals that begins to free them-many for the first time-from the strictures of academic and cultural provincialism. Working with Fred in the field is more than archaeological training; it is a life class, and there are few students who come away from one of his projects unchanged ... As much as any other experience in my adult life, that of living and working with Fred Cooper has determined my view of how the study of antiquity should be approached and how life should be lived, and there are dozens of others out there who would say the same." Fred Gooper has been a constant and vital presence in the field for over 30 years. He has unselfishly and unceasingly shared his journey of discovery. As his students write, it is impossible to separate Fred the field archaeologist and scholar from Fred the teacher: the study of antiquity is his life, his all-consuming passion, and he teaches most profoundly through the example of his life. He has personally and directly touched stu- dents of all sorts and from several nations. Many have been inspired to go on to higher degrees in ancient studies (the list is impressive, and their loyalty to Fred steadfast) or have made antiquity one focus of their chosen field, while others have gone on to something entirely different. All left Greece and Fred's projects with a sense that they had experienced something remarkable. For his outstanding and innovative pedagogy and for his deep love of archaeology, the Archaeological In- stitute of America is pleased to present its first Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award to Frederick A. Cooper of the University of Minnesota.</page><page sequence="6">336 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA JAMES R. WISEMAN BOOK AWARD P. ROGER S. MOOREY The Archaeological Institute of America is pleased to present the James R. Wiseman Book Award for 1996 to P. Roger S. Moorey for his book Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1994). The book is a revision and considerable amplification of Moorey's work of 1985, Materials and Manufacture in Ancient Mesopotamia: The Evidence of Archaeology and Art (BAR 237, Oxford 1985). Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries brilliantly succeeds in taking a place beside Alfred Lucas's famous Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries (in its last edition with J. R. Harris), one of the most useful and long- lasting reference works in Egyptology and in Mediterranean, Near Eastern, and African archaeology. As is the case with the work of Lucas and Harris, we expect that Moorey-- as it may become known - will be consulted by generations of students, scholars, and general readers. Moorey moves with ease and elegance among fields and methods as diverse as lexicography and stereoscopy, chemistry and iconography, while reviewing the state of our knowledge of ancient Mesopotamian stoneworking; manufacture of bone, ivory, and shell artifacts; metallurgy and metalworking; architectural materials and building techniques; and glazed materials and glass. He makes it look easy, but his careful and balanced reportage represents years of detailed investigation and thoughtful evaluation. Curators and conservators, archaeologists and art historians, and specialists in many other fields will find not only that Moorey has gathered and assessed the evidence but also that he has quietly shaped views of Mesopotamian material culture- and the technical practices and cultural interests that lie behind it- that will be the scholarly basis for many reflections, and, no doubt, creative polemics and new in- quiries, for many years to come.</page><page sequence="7">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 337 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION IA: EPIGRAPHY AND NUMISMATICS HERMES GRAFFITI FROM OLBIA PONTICA RE- EXAMINED: Lada Onyshkevych, University of Pennsylvania Among the handful of multiple-line graffiti found in the excavations of the northern Black Sea colony of Olbia are two that refer to Hermes and his cult. These graffiti, first published in the former Soviet Union by A.S. Rusiaeva in 1979, and again by A.A. Beletsky and A.S. Rusiaeva in 1984, contain many elements that require further analysis, utilizing the resources available to Western scholarship. The graffiti, scratched on the surfaces of potsherds, can be dated to the late fifth-fourth centuries B.C. Accompany- ing the texts of these informal inscriptions are schematic drawings of human heads, with objects depicted as over- lapping or possibly thrust through the heads. Both draw- ings and texts contain elements that may link Hermes to magic and curses; while such a connection is known else- where in the Greek world, it has not previously been firmly attested in the northern Black Sea region. The inscriptions also refer to a priest of Hermes, as well as to a prophet of Hermes who was also connected to Athena. These sig- nificant references can augment the overall picture of Hermes' cult in the greater Hellenic world, and serve to illuminate the role that Hermes and his cult played in the religious or secular life of this far corner of the Greek world. E86icKt 6 0c6;: THEME AND THE CONCEPT OF HEAL- ING IN THE EPIDAURIAN IAMATA: Sarah C. Stroup, University of California, Berkeley Modern investigations of the Epidaurian iamata have produced an apparently unavoidable, yet unacceptable, dichotomy. With the exception of Lidonicci's recent con- tribution in AJP 113 (1992) 24-41, there is a tendency to identify and separate elements of practical medicine from those of "pure" religion. This dichotomy, artificial when applied to much of Greek medicine, is particularly prob- lematic for analyzing these iamata. In this paper, I pro. pose a concept of the practical and the divine framed not as a dichotomy, but rather a continuum on which the two are situated at opposite ends. The physical context of the iamata is, I argue, crucial to an understanding of the practical function of these in- scribed cures. The iamata advertise both physical cures and spiritual conversions and, for those who came to be healed, were the primary indicators of the efficacy of the sanctuary. It is important to the development of group dy- namic that the iamata were made accessible to the sup- pliants prior to incubation. The iamata witness cures of the past as they suggest those of the future. I argue that the language and organization of the iamata suggest an originally informal collation later adapted to the formulae of inscribed cure: plasticity of description is an inherent feature of this process. Disparate elements of the "prac- tical" and "divine" thus coincide in a cure that exists only as a point on a continuum of all that is meant by "healing." IG 112, 1714: AN ACEPHALOUS LIST OF ATHENIAN ARCHONS FROM AROUND THE TIME OF THE FIRST MITHRIDATIC WAR:John D. Morgan, University of Delaware, and Kevin M. Clinton, Cornell University IG II2, 1714, datable to some year around 90 B.C., lists all nine annual Athenian archons except the eponymous archon, who gave his name to the year. Sterling Dow (Hes- peria 3 [1934] 144-46) observed that the space at the top of the stone was insufficient for the title and name of the eponymous archon, and suggested that the list could be dated precisely to the Athenian year 88/7 B.C., when the eponymous archon list IG II2, 1713 records an anarchia during the control of Athens by a pro-Mithridatic govern- ment. Dow's proposal has been generally accepted, although the eight archons listed were demonstrably members of prominent upper-class families who prima facie seem un- likely members of the pro-Mithridatic revolutionary gov- ernment of 88/7. We point out that this stone, which in the 18th century was transported from Athens to Paris and is now in the Louvre, is probably not a complete stele listing all who held annual archonships, as has been universally supposed, but the front face sawn off from a statue base, to reduce its weight for transportation, as was commonly done by the French. This base could well have supported an upper member, bearing the title and name of the eponymous archon, and dedicating a statue. Hence this inscription should be dated not to 8817 B.C. but to another year ca. 90 B.C. when Athens had a pro-Roman upper-class govern- ment. Our reinterpretation and redating of IG II2, 1714 necessitate profound revisions of modern views on how upper-class Athenians chose sides upon Mithridates' in- vasion of the Roman provinces. THE COINAGE OF THE ARCHON HYGIAENON FOR THE BOSPORAN KINGDOM: Elena Stolyarik, American Numismatic Society The mysterious coinage of the archon Hygiaenon is rep- resented by a unique gold piece in the Historical Museum of Moscow, two drachms, and one tetrachalk. Hygiaenon's existence has been confirmed by the finding of rooftiles with his name in a controlled archaeological context. In 1994 E.A. Molev, basing his analysis on the caps of the Dioscuri on the reverse of the tetrachalk, argued that the coins of Hygiaenon must belong to the late second cen-</page><page sequence="8">338 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 tury, and dated Hygiaenon's rule to 145-130 B.C. But the Dioscuri-caps coin type is connected with the rise of Pon- tic hegemony in the Black Sea region under Mithridates VI, and occurs only at the very end of the second century. Hygiaenon's gold coin has the same reverse type as the Lysimachus-type coin struck in Byzantium with trident, dol- phins, and two monograms. H. Seyrig argued from the hoard evidence that this type of gold coin was issued be- tween 190 and 180 B.C. I believe the gold coin must be dated to 190-170 B.C., and that the tetrachalk is not an issue of Hygiaenon at all. Hygiaenon's issues may be con- nected with the sole rule of Queen Kamasariya (180-160 B.C.). She was the only sole female ruler of the Bosporan kingdom. It is possible that before her marriage she relied for support on the archon Hygiaenon. Hygiaenon's role as military strongman is hinted at by the soldierly coin type of his silver drachm. THE AUGURACULUM, SUET. TIT. 5-9, AND A NEW DENARIUS FROM CARTHAGE: John D. Mac Isaac, Mary Washington College A denarius of the emperor Titus recently found by the University of Georgia's excavation team at Carthage pre- serves a detail that has not been noted on previously pub- lished examples from this emperor's "sellesternium" series. This detail allows the recognition of this type as a com- memoration of the taking of the New Year's auspices of A.D. 80 by the emperor, who was both consul and pontifex maximus. The newly noted symbol, the augural lituus, is placed in what is clearly the pediment of an old-style Re- publican temple, before which the usual magisterial seat is shown. This combination is interpreted as a direct ref- erence to the site where the sacred observations at the start of the consular year were taken, the Auguraculum, located on the Arx of the Capitoline Hill, just below the ancient Temple of Juno Moneta. This interpretation makes this coin the only known reference to one of the most impor- tant sites of the Roman state religion; it gives a new venue for understanding the meaning of the other depictions in this important coin series (previously, at least partially, ill understood); and it provides a specific illustration of the portrait painted in Suetonius of Titus as a supersti- tious man much perturbed by omens and forecasts of the future even to his dying day. COINS AND THE BIOGRAPHY OF THE USURPER LAE- LIANUS: Liane Houghtalin, Mary Washington College In A.D. 268 Ulpius Cornelius Laelianus led part of the Rhine army in revolt against the Gallic usurper Postumus. The ancient historians offer scant information about Lael- ianus and do not even agree on the spelling of his name, the best evidence for which comes from his coins. Modern scholars have also turned to his coinage for information about his background and policy. One of Laelianus's coins depicts a female figure accom- panied by a rabbit, interpreted as a personification of the province Hispania. This interpretation has led to specu- lations about a Spanish origin for Laelianus and the pos- sibility of an appeal to that province. A review of Roman province-types, however, demonstrates that the figure is more likely that of Moesia. While the same image did ap- pear as a Hispania under Hadrian, it was subsequently adopted as the badge of Moesia Inferior by the cities of Marcianopolis and Nicopolis ad Istrum in the third cen- tury. The rabbit also appeared as an attribute for a third- century personification of Moesia Superior. Several of the legions in Laelianus's area of concern originated or served in Moesia, and other aspects of his coinage demonstrate that he was interested in appealing to those units. The use of "Ulpius" in Laelianus's name has been seen as further evidence for a Spanish connection. The name was known outside of Spain, however, and was probably directed at the legion Ulpia Victrix XXX, whose support would have placed Postumus in a poor strategic position. ROME AND ALEXANDRIA IN THE REIGN OF AURELIAN: William E. Metcalf, American Numismatic Society Rome and Alexandria were the two most prolific mints of the empire. For most of their histories the coinages, which did not circulate together, followed their own rules of be- havior, but new evidence suggests that during the reign of Aurelian currency adjustments in the empire at large were reflected in the Alexandrian coinage. A sharp break in the hoards- mainly those recovered at Karanis - centers on Aurelian's year 5. Work undertaken in connection with a forthcoming volume of Roman Pro- vincial Coinage has brought to light more than a dozen pre- viously undetected overstrikes from the same period. The terminus post quem for the overstriking is now established as Aurelian's year 4 (272/3). It is sheer coincidence that one of the undertypes is a coin of Aurelian and Vaballathus, for other overstrikes - all on coins of Aurelian himself- suggest that the motive was replacement not just of the Palmyrene usurper's coinage, but of all the coins of Aurelian's early years. The replacement of earlier currency brought with it a clear improvement in style, manifest in coins of year 5 (273/4), as well as a major downward adjust- ment of the weight of the tetradrachm that began in this year and concluded in year 6. During his fifth regnal year the empire-wide reform took place, probably in spring 274, and it is now clear that a reform in Egypt paralleled that in the rest of the empire. VISUAL TRICKS IN ANCIENT ART: David Smart, Brown University Optical illusions in ancient art are more common than generally supposed. Floor mosaics transform flat two- dimensional space into an undulating surface of shifting depth or outward projection. Animals and animal parts are incorporated into, and hidden within, human facial features. "Bicorporates" have two flanking animal bodies sharing a frontal head. "Three-in-one" compound heads</page><page sequence="9">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 339 appear in sculpture. A fifth type is startling and unusual: an image with two different "readings" that can only be recognized separately. This visual trick, common in mod- ern psychological tests, appears on a coin from Mytilene. Two superimposed profile heads are legible, left and right, but only one at a time. Similar optical effects can be cited in at least three other cases and many more are likely to lurk, as yet unrecognized, in ancient art. Their iconograph- ical significance remains to be determined, but several pos- sibilities are proposed for the Mytilene types. SESSION IB: THE ROMAN EAST THE 1996 EXCAVATIONS AT ABILA OF THE DECAPOLIS: W Harold Mare, Covenant Theological Seminary During the 1996 season at Abila of the Decapolis, 15 June to 3 August, a staff of 32 worked on the two tells, in the civic center, and in the cemetery. On Tell Abila, the north tell, we continued excavations in the deep trenches, further exposing pure Early Bronze, as well as later Middle- Late Bronze, Iron Age, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic strata. On the south tell, Umm el Amad, in the east triapsidal church we found an additional side apse attached to the north wall, no doubt used for special re- ligious services, and in the west church we uncovered a white marble pavement just inside the main threshold. In the central civic center we uncovered much more of the large Roman period plaza in front of the theater cavea, and in the bath/nymphaeum complex we further defined the extent of the several Roman period settling tanks and further exposed the main threshold and south aisle thresh- olds of the nearby Byzantine cruciform basilica. In the large necropolis area just north and east of Abila, the excava- tion team excavated several robbed Roman/Byzantine tombs as well as one or two undisturbed tombs, including a large Roman tomb complex with elaborate wall frescoes with human figures and inscriptions. THE PETRA SOUTHERN TEMPLE: THE FOURTH SEASON, 1996: Martha SharpJoukowsky, Brown University The Southern ("Great") Temple of Petra has been under excavation since 1993 by Brown University archaeologists under the auspices of the Jordanian Department of An- tiquities. These excavations have already provided pivotal information about the forms of free-standing monumental architecture created by the Nabataeans in their "Golden Age" during the first century A.D. This report presents the results of the 1996 investiga- tions based on the major architectural and sculptural re- mains (including elephant-headed capitals) discovered in previous years. Past investigations assumed the temple pre- cinct was a single- or two-period structure. The 1995 re- sults, however, have challenged these hypotheses. A closer look is given to the lower temenos, since the recovery of a monumental arched structure lying some 6 m below the later Nabataean double-colonnaded hexagonal court is puz- zling. We anticipate further elucidation of the elegant west exedra as well as the Southern Temple interior, most par- ticularly the multi-storied adyton. The architectural evi- dence combined with the archaeological data allow pre- liminary conclusions about the sweeping changes that took place in first-century Nabataean architectural planning. The plethora of artifacts found with unique architecture identify the Southern Temple as a cult complex that differs considerably from contemporary structures at Petra. The information from the Southern Temple helps define the Nabataean capital, the complexities of its public setting, and the unusual and enigmatic architectural design prac- tices of the Nabataeans. THE ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE OF THE SOUTHERN TEMPLE AT PETRA, JORDAN: Erika Lee Schluntz, Brown University The Brown University excavations of the Southern Temple Complex at Petra have, in four seasons of fieldwork, uncovered a wealth of carved architectural fragments that originally adorned the temple facade and interior. These decorative limestone artifacts, numbering in the hundreds, include elaborately carved floral and vegetal elements, such as pomegranates, bushy acanthus leaves and pinecones, as well as a series of arresting, mask-like heads. Also re- covered were a wide array of molded stucco pieces, chiefly stringcourses, some with their original paint preserved. This paper presents the description and analysis of these architectural embellishments, both in terms of the overall decorative program of the Southern Temple, but also in the wider context of Nabataean classical religion and art. Because little is known about the religious interests and practices of the Nabataeans, these sculptural remains pro- vide essential clues toward an understanding of the deity or deities worshipped within this monumental temple com- plex. The well-developed style and excellent quality of these artifacts, when viewed against the background of existing Nabataean architectural art, both within Petra and also in its caravan cities, also provide important information for determining the period of construction and use of the Southern Temple. THE PROMONTORY PALACE AT CAESAREA MARITIMA, ISRAEL: THE 1995 AND 1996 SEASONS: Barbara Bur- rell, University of Cincinnati, and Kathryn Glea- son, Cornell University The University of Pennsylvania Excavation at Caesarea Maritima devoted its 1995-1996 seasons to clarification and documentation of the Promontory Palace, the com- plex that we postulate to be the Palace of Herod the Great. For the first time, the site was fully integrated into the broader city plan with AutoCAD mapping and reconstruc- tion. The building's layout had a public, governmental wing facing, but bastioned against, the city's entertainment cen- ters; a private, palatial wing on the seaside was perhaps</page><page sequence="10">340 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 earlier. This design can be compared to that of other palaces and praetoria in the Mediterranean. A large hall in the public wing may be the site of the akroaterion of St. Paul (Acts 25:23). Later mosaics from this hall reflect the building's status in the Early Byzantine period, and their study, conservation, and illustration have been ongoing. Also found in the public wing was a well house, perhaps remodeled from an earlier chamber-tomb, and a later well, which yielded lead curse tablets. A recently revealed mikveh, or ritual bath, also gives new insights into the building's operations at the intersection ofJewish and Helleno-Roman culture. THE COMBINED CAESAREA EXPEDITIONS, 1995-1996: Martha K. Risser, Trinity College In 1991-1995, excavations were conducted just south of the harbor at Caesarea Maritima, Israel by the Com- bined Caesarea Expeditions and the Caesarea Maritima Vault Project. The vaulted warehouse complex, previously considered Herodian in date, is demonstrably a second- century construction. The series of floors suggest contin- uous use of the vaults from their construction until their partial collapse in the mid-seventh century. Southeast of the harbor, excavations continue on the temple platform, where Herod's temple to Roma and Augustus has been dis- covered below a sixth-century octagonal church. New ex- cavations in a residential quarter north of the inner har- bor were opened during the 1996 season. Underwater excavators continue to examine the arrangement of the well-preserved wooden caissons that held the hydraulic con- crete for the harbor breakwaters. The harbor sediments are being analyzed for micropalaeontological and sedi- mentological information. EXCAVATIONS IN THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS MEGISTOS AT DURA-EUROPOS, 1996: Susan B. Downey, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles Excavations on the east side of the Temple of Zeus Megistos at Dura-Europos in 1996 revealed part of the foun- dation course of a large structure that was demolished to make way for the temple. A continuous section of a single course of a wall of well-cut gypsum headers and stretchers, founded partly on bedrock, partly on a hard-packed sur- face of red earth and stones, is preserved for a north- south length of 8.50 m. The upper surface of some blocks is covered with rubblework like that used in the Hellenis- tic palace of the strategos as the fill for a wall of gypsum orthostats. A hole in the southernmost block, probably for a door post, suggests a gate. Near the south end is a single block of an east-west wall, presumably cut to build the temple, and a row of headers on each side flanks the northernmost preserved portion of the wall for approx- imately 4 m. About 5 m to the north of this section of foun- dations and aligned with them are one header and one stretcher, but any construction between them was removed down to bedrock. The excellent masonry of the blocks, the similarity of the construction to the palace of the strategos, and the foundation on bedrock supplemented by a packing sup- port a Hellenistic date. Although the remains are extremely fragmentary, they most likely are evidence for a monu- mental courtyard surrounding some predecessor to the current Temple of Zeus Megistos. ROUGH CILICIA REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SUR- VEY PROJECT: REPORT OF THE 1996 SEASON: Jen- nifer Tobin, Bilkent University, Richard Blanton and Nicholas K. Rauh, Purdue University, Mette Korsholm, Danish Institute in Athens, Rhys Town- send, Clark University, and Stephen Tracy, Ohio State University A systematic surface survey of a 60-km coastal strip of western Rough Cilicia, from Coracesium (Alanya) to An- tiochia ad Cragum, is contributing new data and ideas to social theories that address the consequences of interac- tion on the scales of world system, area, and region. The region, while environmentally marginal and never the lo- cation of a major polity, was well situated, in a way other marginal regions were not, to intermediate in major sea- borne commercial flows along the boundaries of impor- tant polities, and between major Mediterranean sea routes and the inland populations of Anatolia. Rough Cilicia proved an ideal setting for the development of semiperiph- ery and boundary polities, a process most clearly expressed in the growth of the powerful Cilician pirate societies of the Late Hellenistic period (139-67 B.C.). Our survey is locating, describing, and analyzing all sites within the re- gion to reconstruct patterns of long-term social change and to contextualize the pirate social system within the systems that preceded and followed it. We are examining the growth of these economically influential but virtually unknown social systems, while at the same time attempt- ing to elucidate the nature of social change in this impor- tant intermediary region. The project's larger goals are to expand our awareness of the nature of social change in an influential semiperiphery and to contribute to the growing comparative study of semiperipheral actors in the transformation of world systems generally. FROM FORTUNA TO DEA ROMA: THE REDIRECTION OF WORSHIP IN ROMAN IMPERIAL PORTS: Steven L. Tuck, University of Michigan The worship of the Roman goddess Fortuna, bringer of increase or fertility, developed naturally in Roman ports where the precariousness of sea travel united with the po- tential for rich rewards. In the Republican period, some ports, such as Antium, were dominated by temples to For- tuna while others were ornamented by thankful travelers with individual dedications of statues and altars. With in- creased contact between the Roman and Greek worlds, For- tuna became identified with Tyche. In the last century of the Republic, leaders such as Sulla and Caesar made ma- jor public foundations allying themselves with Fortuna. With the principate of Augustus a change occurred, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean where the iconog- raphy of Tyche was well known and widespread. The priv- ileged place once held by Fortuna in Roman ports, often</page><page sequence="11">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 341 an elevated temple or statue opposite the harbor entrance, was usurped by the worship of the emperors and Dea Roma. The archaeological, textual, and numismatic evidence from Portus, Sebastos, Porto Raphti, and other ports charts this redirection of worship. The imperial cult appropriated the attributes and traditional worship of Fortuna/Tyche to create a worship of prosperity and success for Dea Roma, who then received prayers and gifts of thanksgiving for successful sea travel and trade. This Fortuna/nautical as- pect of the imperial cult became a powerful ideological tool owing to the overwhelming importance of sea travel to the unification of the empire, the imperial control of the grain trade, and the imperial patronage of monumental harbors around the Mediterranean. EXCAVATIONS AT HACIMUSALAR IN NORTH-CENTRAL LYCIA: Ilknur Ozgen, Deniz Kaptan, and Jean Oztiirk, Bilkent University, and Mark B. Garrison, Trinity University The large mound of Hacimusalar lies in north-central Lycia in the Elmali plain. Epigraphic evidence suggests that the site is ancient Roman Choma. Survey and exca- vation that began in 1993, the first systematic exploration of the site, have revealed a pottery sequence that indicates occupation running from the Neolithic into the Islamic period. The site, after further excavation, should become the major type site for the region. Survey has shown that the site is surrounded by a network of small mounds and settlements that must be connected with Hacimusalar in a larger regional system. Current explorations are focused on Hellenistic and Roman remains on the mound and its surroundings. Despite disturbances caused by illegal excavations, the 1994-1995 seasons located undisturbed areas of the mound, in particular Late Roman domestic structures. In addition to examples of fine imported pottery, there is an abun- dance of local pottery that has particular importance for establishing a definitive ceramic sequence for the region. A significant result of the 1995 survey was the discovery of a kiln site that appears to have been in use from at least the Hellenistic period into the Roman. The site is situated at Sarnig alani-diizii, some kilometers from Hacimusalar. Preliminary investigations were also conducted at Yapraklar, a site with difficult access where villagers recently discov- ered rock carvings and sarcophagi (one bearing a sympo- sium scene), a church, and additional evidence for Late Roman settlement. SESSION IC: HYDRAULICS AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES DRAINS AND DRAINAGE IN THE MYCENAEAN CITADELS AND ENVIRONS: Thea K. Smith, University of Cin- cinnati The semiarid climate of the Mediterranean generates heavy, even torrential, rainfall from October through March; without adequate provision for drainage, these seasonal rains would damage croplands, streets, and buildings. In wet weather or dry, the water utilized for tasks such as craft production, bathing, cooking, and washing must be dis- posed. Residents of the Late Bronze Age citadels of main- land Greece devised various systems for the routing and removal of water: terracotta pipes and earthen- and stone- lined channels led runoff rainwater and wastewater to drain holes traversing the citadel walls. In some instances, open gutters were also employed. Outside the citadels, less formal arrangements sufficed; water was dispersed in any nearby open area. Despite the need for a secure supply of potable water so dramatically demonstrated by the underground cisterns at Mycenae, Tiryns, and Athens, there is no evidence in- dicating that runoff rainwater was systematically captured and saved for reuse. Portable cisterns of ceramic or wood may have been placed under the eaves as needed to catch rainwater, but there was no citywide routing of rainwater to large architectural-style cisterns. Potentially useful waste- water, likewise, was not channeled for reuse in manufac- turing or agriculture. These arrangements indicate that issues of water pro- visioning and water removal were resolved separately, pos- sibly according to season and/or locale; an ancillary con- clusion is that, at times, drainage and water dispersal took priority over water retention and storage. ANALYSIS OF CLOSED-PIPE AQUEDUCTS:John A. Seeger, American University in Cairo Open-channel aqueducts were the most common method of supplying water to populated areas during Roman times. Closed-pipe water systems were also used during both the Greek and Roman periods. A closed-pipe aqueduct dating to the second century B.C. was found at Pergamon. Vitru- vius (De Arch. 8.6) describes closed-pipe systems in some detail. One type consists of ceramic pipe sections with each section narrowed at one end to fit into the adjoining sec- tion. A similar aqueduct was found at the Roman fort at 'Abu Sha'ar, Egypt, during excavations carried out by the University of Delaware. In this paper I present a method of analyzing water flow in closed-pipe aqueducts. Rate of flow of water in a closed-pipe system can be found using a computer program based on the general energy equation for a control volume. Data required include eleva- tions of the water line, length of the line, and dimensions of the pipe sections. Internal pipe roughness is also a fac- tor. The aqueduct at 'Abu Sha'ar covers a distance of more than 1 km. Elevations and other data were measured. As a result of the analysis, a flow rate of 73.9 1 per minute was calculated. Over a 10-hour period, more than 44,000 1 could be supplied. This amount is more than adequate for the daily needs of the fort's garrison, estimated to num- ber about 500. A bath installation found near the fort in- dicates an ample water supply. THE MOUNTAIN AQUEDUCT OF ELAIUSSA-SEBASTE IN ROUGH CILICIA: Dennis Murphy and Melissa Men- gel, Denver Society The Lamas River marks the boundary between Rough Cilicia and Plain Cilicia. It was also the primary water source</page><page sequence="12">342 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 that supplied the cities of Elaiussa-Sebaste and Korykos in the Late Roman period. This water supply was carried via a mountainous aqueduct some 18 km in length. In 1993 and 1995 a surface survey of major portions of the aque- duct was carried out, documenting the construction tech- niques of the channel and arcades. An associated castel- lum and several bath complexes that were supplied water by it were also documented. This aqueduct appears to represent a number of the more common aqueduct construction techniques, such as open channels, channels cut into the sides of cliffs with access openings for maintenance, and arcades crossing val- leys. The castellum is in an excellent state of preservation and relatively large. It is cut partly out of living rock in the hillside above Elaiussa-Sebaste and appears to have also served the island portion of the town via a slender arcade of which there is little remaining today. A REDISCOVERED FOUNTAIN HOUSE IN ANCIENT COR- INTH: Mark E. Landon, Cornell University In May of 1909, members of the American School of Classical Studies excavated an ancient hydraulic complex ca. 200 m west of the theater of ancient Corinth. The results of the excavation were never published and the re- mains are no longer visible today, but the appearance of the complex can be partly reconstructed from the original excavation notes. These suggest that, during the Roman period at least, the newly recovered installation was a large and luxuriously appointed fountain house, similar in many details of its construction to the more celebrated fountains known from other parts of the city. Cut back into the face of a natural terrace in characteristic Corinthian fashion, the complex consisted of a series of rock-cut chambers with painted stucco walls and mosaic and marble floors, fed by two underground supply tunnels extending back be- neath the terrace at least 25 m behind the chambers them- selves. The pre-Roman history of the installation remains obscure, but the fountain evidently served as an impor- tant source of water throughout the Middle Ages, and con- tinued to supply a small Turkish fountain house as recently as the early years of this century. Apart from its value as an addition to the corpus of Corinthian fountains, a mon- ument type for which Corinth has been famous since an- tiquity, the new installation also provides some welcome topographical information about a district of the ancient city that, in spite of a century of American excavation at the site, remains largely unexplored. THE "RESERVOIR" OF HADRIAN IN ATHENS: Shawna Leigh, University of Pennsylvania In A.D. 1436 Cyriacus of Ancona visited the lower south- west slope of the Lykabettos Hill near Athens. There he saw the remains of an Ionic tetrastyle facade that carried two inscribed entablature blocks. Cyriacus copied the full inscription, which stated that in 140 Antoninus Pius com- pleted and dedicated an aqueduct "in New Athens" that had been begun by his father, Hadrian. Later travelers re- corded that this facade stood before a rectangular rock cutting, probably a reservoir associated with the aqueduct. Although the existence of this building has long been known, no one has attempted to reconstruct the form of the edifice, as a reservoir was built over the ancient struc- ture in 1871. In this paper I present evidence gathered from 19th-century documents that suggests that the Had- rianic building was a vaulted three-aisled basilica. In ad- dition, I use archaeological evidence from the site to show that the reconstruction drawing of the facade by Stuart and Revett is incorrect in terms of the width of the central intercolumniation. My proposed central intercolumniation shows that the modern structure reuses the rock cutting of the ancient building without further alteration to the site. On the basis of comparanda from Italy, the location of the building, and a basin at the site, I suggest that this Hadrianic "reservoir" was in fact an ornamental nymphae- um, purely Roman in style. PRODUCTION OF BRONZE STANDS IN CRETE AT THE END OF THE BRONZE AGE: NEW EVIDENCE FROM PALAIKASTRO: Sean A. Hemingway, Bryn Mawr College During the 1991 excavation season at Palaikastro in east- ern Crete, an important deposit of metallurgical debris was unearthed. This deposit consists of many disposable elements of a small-scale casting operation, including tu- yeres, crucibles, and mold fragments. Study of this mate- rial has yielded significant new evidence for the produc- tion of at least one cast rod tripod stand and associated cauldron. Elements of the stand and cauldron identifiable from mold fragments include sections of the legs, frag- ments of the volutes that capped the legs, a possible foot mold, and molds for double-banded cauldron handles. The rod tripod is a well-known type of stand that first appears at the end of the Bronze Age on Cyprus, and oc- curs in Crete, mainland Greece, the Cyclades, and Euboea, as well as Sardinia and southern Italy, as late as the Late Geometric period. The stands are considered to be some of the finest metalwork produced in the prehistoric Ae- gean. In the past, it has been argued that all such stands were made by select workshops on Cyprus in the LC IIC- IIIB periods and that those stands found in later contexts were precious heirlooms. The Palaikastro molds are the first evidence for the actual manufacture of this type of stand. Their East Cretan context demonstrates conclusively that such stands were produced in Crete; they constitute a significant precedent for the later sequence of Cretan rod tripod stands from the Iron Age. GLASSBLOWERS IN GREEK POETRY: E. Marianne Stern, Toledo Society An anonymous Greek poet describes an ancient glass- blower at work in such detail that the modern editor won- ders: "We lack any statement of the removal of the glass from the furnace prior to the blowing operation" (R.A. Coles, The Oxyrrhynchus Papyri 50 [1983] 58). The concept of gathering molten glass is familiar but other ways of</page><page sequence="13">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 343 getting glass on a blowpipe exist. The poem describes one such alternative method: harpazein bolon, picking up a chunk of glass. "First he [the ancient glassblower] heated the tip of the blowpipe and then he picked up a chunk of glass from nearby" (lines 2-3). He heated the glass in the furnace (lines 4-6) until it was soft enough to be blown (lines 7ff). Picking up a chunk of glass on the blowpipe is routine to many studio artists. The tip of the pipe has to be heated (line 2) so that the glass will stick. The expression "from nearby" (line 3) probably refers to the preheating of the glass chunk to avoid thermal shock when the glowing pipe was touched to it. The discus of a first-century Roman oil lamp shows glass chunks heating up in front of the fur- nace. Anth. Pal. 16.323, ascribed to Mesomedes of Crete (second century A.D.), might describe a glassblower using tongs to attach a glass chunk to his pipe. Archaeological evidence suggests that picking up chunks was still practiced in Palestine as late as the fourth century (E.M. Stern,JRA 5 [1992] 490-94). The procedure has many advantages, the most important ones being that it does not require a furnace or crucible for melting raw glass and requires significantly less fuel than working with molten glass; there is also much less waste. THE PRODUCTION OF CRUCIBLE STEEL IN MERV, TURK- MENISTAN, DURING THE EARLY ISLAMIC PERIOD: Ann M. Feuerbach, University College London The investigation of an Early Islamic (800-900) metal- lurgical workshop at the ancient city of Merv by the Interna- tional Merv Project has revealed evidence for steel produc- tion. Excavations (1991-1995) uncovered remains including two furnaces, a mudbrick wall, postholes, and a pit con- taining broken crucibles and ash. Subsequent laboratory analysis at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, suggests that the ancient metallurgical process involved fusing together cast iron (a high carbon alloy) and perhaps wrought iron (a low carbon alloy) in a crucible in order to produce steel (an alloy of intermediate carbon content). Refiring experiments performed on the crucible suggest that the crucible was able to withstand tempera- tures upward of 15500C: extremely refractory for an an- cient ceramic. This method of making steel appears to be consistent with the method described by Islamic authors to produce Damascus steel. This is believed to be the first archaeological evidence for this process. In the presenta- tion, I briefly describe the history of the site, the evidence found during excavation, and the laboratory analysis, and I compare the evidence with that of Islamic texts. SESSION ID: GARDENS GALORE: GOLD MED- AL COLLOQUIUM GARDENS OF EDEN: EXOTIC FLORA AND FAUNA IN MESOPOTAMIA, EGYPT, AND THE AEGEAN: Karen Po- linger Foster, Yale University In ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, and in the Bronze Age Aegean, exotic plants and animals were of consider- able interest to royalty and private individuals. Some col- lected rarities out of intellectual curiosity, while others were motivated by potential economic rewards. Many rulers saw acquisition and display of exotic flora and fauna as an effec- tive way to enhance prestige or to demonstrate imperial dominion over far-flung lands. Botanical gardens and zoos were designed so that transplanted species could success- fully establish themselves in their new environments. Speci- mens of exotic flora and fauna were prized as tribute offer- ings and suitable gifts for royalty. Certain non-native plants and animals were needed for the enactment of religious and other ceremonies. Finally, the controlled coexistence of exotic and indigenous flora and fauna in palatial and urban settings provided a powerful visual metaphor for intellectual constructions of a more perfect world, the orig- inal gardens of Eden. This paper touches on selected aspects of this subject, drawn from my on-going, comprehensive investigation of some 400 artistic representations, actual remains of flora and fauna, numerous literary and other textual references, and archaeological evidence for the world's earliest botan- ical and zoological gardens. In Bronze Age tradition, I offer these exotica from Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Aegean to the Roman gardens of the 1996 AIA Gold Medalist. ROYAL GARDENS AND PUBLIC IMAGE IN ASSYRIA, BABY- LONIA, AND ACHAEMENID IRAN: David Stronach, University of California, Berkeley Abstract not available. ART AND NATURE IN THE ROMAN VILLA AT OPLON- TIS: Bettina Bergmann, Mount Holyoke College "How can that be a villa, if it has neither the trappings of the city nor the makings of a farm?" Thus Varro debated the new mix of rustic and urban in the Roman villa of the mid-first century B.C. (Rust. 3.2.9). This paper examines the most complete maritime estate of Varro's day, the Cam- panian villa at Oplontis, and its elaboration over a century. Unique for its 13 interior and exterior gardens (excavated by Wilhelmina Jashemski with new techniques to reveal plants, birds, and animals), over 50 garden sculptures, and illusionistic wall-paintings, the villa is well known in parts, but has never been fully assessed as an ensemble. At Oplontis, architect, muralist, mosaicist, and topiarius aimed to create an ordered picture through the geometry of the formal garden, the interplay of different media, and framed views. Seen in ground plan, architecture and plant- ings align in a rigid interlocking matrix that extended the building, unifying it with hills and sea. Murals mirrored gardens; painted still-lifes, birds, and animals captured the actual fertile life outdoors; flora and fresco dematerialized architecture. Artfully arranged views offered the spectator "moving pictures" of graduated, seasonal blooming that were animated daily by the rotating sun, cast shadows, and water reflections. This abundant, hybrid nature presented the Roman villa as a site of profit, pleasure, and refined cultivation.</page><page sequence="14">344 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 LANDSCAPE DESIGN INJUDEA AND SYRIA PALAESTINA: TRADITION AND INNOVATION IN THE ROMAN PERIOD: Kathryn Gleason, Cornell University Wilhelmina Jashemski has often noted in her work the long-standing tradition of the hortus in Roman life and ar- chitecture. Over time, as is evident in the gardens of Pom- peii, the garden naturally expanded to accommodate new cultures and religions, as well as to celebrate new discov- eries and garden forms, as the Roman Empire grew. The eastern Mediterranean was a rich source of new ideas un- der the central influence of Alexandria. Were its gardens in turn influenced by Roman traditions and trends? This paper looks at the evidence for a dynamic exchange of ideas about designing landscape in the first centuries B.C. and A.D. in the palaces and villas of Judea and Syria Palaes- tina, in tribute to Professor Jashemski, who has supplied the richest base of archaeological evidence for the Roman garden in Italy and abroad through her excavations and her promotion of scholarship by others. THE IDEA OF THE GARDEN IN ANCIENT GREEK LIT- ERATURE: M. Eleanor Irwin, University of Toronto Abstract not available. SESSION IE: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUIUM: CULTURE CHANGE IN EARLY GREECE FROM MYCENAE TO HOMER: THE CONTINUITY OF GREEK AGRICULTURE: Ruth Palmer, Ohio University Scholars have assumed that Mycenaean and polis-based agriculture were too different in organization and distur- bances at the end of the Bronze Age too severe for con- tinuity of agricultural institutions. I argue for continuity of Mycenaean agricultural practices by showing that the palatial agricultural system was not as specialized and that the social disruptions in the Dark Age were not as great as previously thought. The standard view of Mycenaean agriculture assumes that officials in the palaces oversaw the specialized pro- duction of wheat for rations on large areas of palace land, contrary to traditional agricultural practices, and that the destruction of the palaces completely upset this system. Pastoralism, therefore, was developed as a new subsistence strategy. This view does not explain the continuity in val- ues concerning landholding, labor, and crops. The ability to produce wine and meat for conspicuous consumption always indicated wealth, since it implied that basic subsis- tence needs had already been met. Mycenaean agriculture was never as specialized as this reconstruction suggests. Palace officials collected produce from landholders rather than undertaking large-scale crop production themselves. The Pylos land tenure tablets show a hierarchical community similar to the Archaic polis. The disruptions, moreover, were not as complete as previously thought. A few centers such as Athens and Knossos sur- vived and the basis of wealth was still agriculture. Dark Age burial rituals point to a stratified society, in which the elite held large estates and the peasants were serfs. ETHNIC IDENTITY AND ALTERUMSWISSENSCHAFT:Jeremy Mclnerney, University of Pennsylvania The founders of Altertumswissenschaft viewed ethnic categories such as Dorian, Ionian, and Aeolian as evidence for the evolution of poleis from more primitive tribal states. Once these separate tribes settled, the ties of blood were weakened, and the growth of towns became possible. The Stadtstaat superseded the Stammstaat. To this interpre- tation was sometimes added a mystical veneration of the Dorian spirit, a product of the fierce identification of Ger- man intellectuals with the Greeks. The idea of a Dorian genius was finally rejected, but the evolutionary model still dominates discussions of state formation in ancient Greece. Ethne are usually regarded as relics of an earlier social order. Recent anthropological work on ethnicity, however, has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the idea that tribes are ancient, fixed, and impermeable. Behind homogeneous labels such as the Nuer and the Dinka there lurks a reality that is heterogeneous and unstable. Among the Nilotic Alur, for example, migration, conquest, intermarriage, peaceful absorption, colonization, and partial assimilation all con- tinued over hundreds of years. The tribe is not static, and the notion that the tribe is a vestige of an earlier social order is a misconception. Just as tribes are fluid constructs--"imagined commu- nities" in Anderson's memorable phrase - so too ethnicity is a conscious process of identification, not a simple mat- ter of biological inheritance. Note the Megarians' decision to convert to Dorian speech and manners. The Athenian adoption of the Ionian dialect in 403 B.C. for official doc- uments came after a century of debate over the relation- ship between the Athenians and the Ionians. One gener- ation earlier, Herodotos (1.143) remarked, "Previously the other Ionians and the Athenians used to shun the name 'Ionian'; even today most of them seem to me to be ashamed of it. Ethnicity is a sense of peoplehood, but operates by ex- clusion as much as inclusion. The Panionion was created by decision of the first 12 Ionian cities to exclude others, according to Herodotos. The question of ethnicity was not an antiquarian subject, but part of the process of state for- mation in the Archaic period. Ethnic distinctions were the complement of Panhellenism, creating identities capable of reconciling the conflicting demands of separateness and communality. One was Greek but yet distinct from other Greeks. MIGRATION AND CULTURE CHANGE IN THE NORTH- EAST AEGEAN DURING THE EARLY IRON AGE: MA- TERIAL FACT OR MYTH? Nigel Spencer, Institute of Archaeology, Oxford University The literary tradition of the Greek colonization of the northeast Aegean requires a fundamental reassessment in the light of the archaeology. Greek historical traditions</page><page sequence="15">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 345 suggest that groups of Aeolian Greeks from Thessaly and Boeotia settled the area of Lesbos, forming the northern group of a more general Greek migration eastward during the Dark Ages. From these settlers the Classical Greeks of the area traced their origins via colonization myths. A reexamination focusing upon the archaeological evi- dence from Early Iron Age Lesbos suggests, however, that the picture is not so simple. From the material record, it is obvious that no site in Lesbos shows any trace of the arrival of a completely new population element from main- land Greece. The basic material culture of the island re- mained unchanged, still dominated by the Anatolian cul- tural tradition (as it had been in the Neolithic and throughout the Bronze Age, before the alleged "colonization"). Even in the Archaic period, if one did not have the testimony of the lyric poets, one would hardly have guessed from the material record that there was a society of Aeolian Greeks living in Lesbos. We must fundamentally reassess the complex processes of interaction and change among the people dwelling in the island at this time. The historical tradition of classical antiquity distorts a complicated and prolonged process. There was a clear agenda for the creation of the later tra- ditions that focused on a specific point in the distant past, an agenda that the material record suggests had little basis in the actual events of the time. THE CONUNDRUM OF GREEK POPULATION GROWTH IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.: Donald W.Jones, Oak Ridge National Laboratory I study three methods of inferring eighth-century Greek population growth. The first models growth paths of burials and population and interactions of population growth with its determinants and correlates. Burial and population growth rates are archaeologically indistinguishable over a wide range of models, but burials are more sensitive to changes in agricultural technology and marketing conditions than to changes in burial rules. Models relating excavated buri- als and burial wealth to original burials and burial wealth appear promising but have demanding data requirements. They suggest that excavated burials from periods of rapid population growth overstate population growth via height- ened visibility. This approach yields a rich array of insights, but leaves the impression that inferring population growth from burials growth is difficult. In the second approach a model of productive activity in a village yields a model of growth in the number of settle- ments. Application of the splitting-time formula from this model to data on settlements in eighth-century Attica, Co- rinthia, and the Argolid yields inferred annual population growth rates of 0.8%, 0.4%, and 0.3% for the last 60 years of the eighth century. These figures are more in keeping with what is known about preindustrial and ancient popu- lation growth rates than are rates in the range of 2% to 4%. A third method, well abandonments as indicators of popu- lation change, is hampered by lack of theory regarding well use. The settlement growth model holds promise as an instrument for using a particular class of archaeolog- ical data, but further modeling development may simplify inferential use of burial and well data. SESSION IIA: GREEK SCULPTURE TEMPLE AND IMAGE: DID ALL GREEK TEMPLES HOUSE CULT IMAGES?Jerilyn Grffin Miller, R. Christopher Goodwin and Associates Greek temples are often assumed to have housed cult images. This paper focuses on the corpus of Archaic and Early Classical archaeological data for the presence of these images inside temples. The well-known podia from the Par- thenon and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia are frequently cited as examples of typical statue bases. These bases place their statues at the end of the central axis in an architec- turally dominating position. Scholars often suggest that other temples had similar podia and statues that are no longer preserved in the archaeological record. A thorough examination of the data, however, reveals great architec- tural variety among bases. There is very little evidence for the presence of cult-statue bases in temples in Magna Grae- cia or the Cyclades. In Asia Minor, the monumental temples at Ephesos and Didyma seem to have housed their cult images in small naiskoi, while on Samos the first image probably stood on a small bench toward the rear of the temple. Neither of these Eastern forms is repeated on the mainland. In mainland Greece, the earliest bases, in the Heraion at Olympia and the Athenaion at Tegea, do not present their podia as the dominating architectural components seen in the fifth century. While cult statues were important to the Greeks in temple worship, I argue that the form these podia took was not uniform, and that their use as architectural elements and possibly tools of worship varied significantly by region. LISTENING TO THE EARLY GREEK IMAGES: THE "MAN- TIKLOS APOLLO" RECONSIDERED: Nassos Papalex- androu, Princeton University The "Mantiklos Apollo" in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has always been regarded as the figure that best exemplifies the incipient stages of the Orientalizing style in early Greek bronze sculpture. Its formal qualities set it apart from the Geometric plastic tradition, whereas the dedication to Apollo, inscribed in hexameters on the thighs of the figure (Hansen, CEG I, no. 326), has provided the impetus to consider it an early image of the god himself. The novel elements in the formal and iconographic qual- ities of the "Mantiklos Apollo" have been overstressed, how- ever, and the crucial issue of its function in context remains unresolved. This statuette certainly marks a departure from the Geometric past, but it would be better understood against the predominant traditions of the rendering and function of the human figure in Geometric art. I argue that, in terms of iconography, the figure conforms to the patterns sug- gested by the earlier Lanzeschwinger from Olympia, Delphi, and Athens. Moreover, I suggest that this figure was orig- inally a tripod attachment, mounted either on top of a round handle in typical Geometric fashion or on the rim of such a vessel. Contemporary comparanda in media other than bronze sculpture strongly corroborate such an inter- pretation of the figure. In view of recent progress in our</page><page sequence="16">346 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 understanding of early Greek metrical inscriptions and the role of the hexameter as carrier of authoritative mes- sages, it is possible to detect an oracular quality in the met- rical inscription on the figure. Consequently, the function of the "Mantiklos Apollo" as a tripod figure can be better understood in the context of early Greek divinatory ritual. ORIENTALIZING ASPECTS OF THE ARCHAIC GREEK KORAI: Mary C. Stieber, New York Society The seventh century B.C. is generally acknowledged as the Orientalizing period in Greek art. Recent studies, how- ever, have demonstrated that Orientalism as a phenom- enon in Greek culture is by no means encompassed by or restricted to the period that bears its name (e.g., S. Morris, Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art, Princeton 1992). In fact, what is remarkable is the strength, length, and tenacity of the hold of Oriental art and artifacts upon the Greek visual imagination, affecting Greek art more or less continuously from the Bronze Age to (and possibly through) the fifth century B.C. Even 480 B.C. seems not as sacrosanct a ter- minus as it once was. Some recent writers see a new wave of Orientalizing ironically after the Persian Wars owing to the influx of Persian artifacts as gifts and booty (e.g., M. Root, AJA 89 [1985] 103-20). While this volatile issue continues to command scholarly attention and raise par- tisan hackles, the Archaic period represents a slightly less sensitive territory. A maelstrom of ideas, forms, and influ- ences, from centuries before and distant places, the Greek Archaic period becomes less extraordinary, less original, and less autonomous the more we Hellenists learn to ac- knowledge what is Oriental about it. Put into perspective, the Archaic period finds its proper place in the atmosphere of interchange so characteristic of the ancient Mediter- ranean cultures. Studies of Oriental tendencies in the Archaic period exist, but are primarily centered on the male statues, the kouroi, most specifically on the still-debated Egyptian or- igins for the type and use (or misuse) of various Egyptian canons in the technical matter of formulating proper pro- portions among the various body parts in the new mon- umental medium. Far less attention has been paid to the korai, with an eye toward Oriental borrowings. This paper brings together some seldom-observed and, to my knowl- edge, several unobserved instances of Egyptian and Near Eastern inspiration evident in the female statues of the Archaic period. Some of the areas discussed include hair- styles, clothing, jewelry, accoutrements, ways of wearing and representing drapery, and poses. THE SCULPTURAL PROGRAM OF THE OLD ATHENA TEMPLE AT ATHENS: John R. Marszal, McGill University Several attempts have been made in the past 25 years to reconstruct the pedimental gigantomachy of the Old Athena Temple at Athens with a central frontal chariot, based on a comparison with Delphi, by inserting two marble horse protomes found in the Acropolis excavations and currently on display in the Acropolis Museum with the pedimental sculpture (most recently, M.B. Moore, AJA 99 [1995] 633-39). Such attempts, however, do not adequately account for the full range of material to be associated with the gigantomachy; and they fail to consider alternatives for placing the protomes within the sculptural program of the temple. My investigation of the sculptural remains on display and in the storerooms of the Acropolis Museum permits me to suggest that the reconstruction of the gigantomachy offered by I. Miliades in the 1960s, with 10 figures but no chariot (four fighting pairs and two giants crawling from the corners), is correct. The lion-bull group of the other pediment may be divided, so that the central frontal char- iot may be inserted there, presumably driven by Athena. The program of the sculpture may be compared to that of the Alkmeonid Temple at Delphi, with an epiphany of the temple god(dess) flanked by animal fights on the east and a gigantomachy (the chariot is also to be questioned at Delphi) on the west. REWRITING ATTRIBUTIONS: THE HERMES PROPYLAIOS OF ALKAMENES: Jane E. Francis, Concordia University It is generally accepted that Alkamenes made a Hermes Propylaios in archaistic style that stood at the entrance to the Athenian Acropolis. This attribution is based on two inscribed herms, each purporting to be the work of Alkamenes, and Pausanias's reference to a Hermes on the Acropolis. The inscribed herms and their replicas, how- ever, have very different appearances: the Ephesos type wears snail curls and a neatly organized beard; the Per- gamon type has corkscrew curls and a disheveled beard. Yet both monuments claim the same master. Scholarship generally depends on stylistic analysis to identify the Hermes Propylaios of Alkamenes: one herm is rejected, usually as a later variant, and the other accepted as a more accurate reflection of the original, fifth-century monu- ment. So far, no available evidence gives one herm a greater claim to Alkamenean originality than the other. A recent examination of the Pergamon herm, however, changes this situation: the head currently set on the in- scribed shaft does not belong to it, and the Pergamon herm type should therefore no longer be ascribed to Alkamenes. This leaves the Ephesos type, and epigraphical evidence suggests that its attribution too is suspect. These herms offer no proof that Alkamenes made a Hermes Propylaios; he may have made a herm, but its appearance, epithet, and provenience are today unknown. In this paper I examine the Pergamon herm and the Ephesos inscription, and demonstrate the need for a revised interpretation of the Hermes Propylaios of Alkamenes. THE PERSONIFICATION OF BOULE ON A LATE CLAS- SICAL STATUE BASE: Amy C. Smith, Yale University Although extant monuments from Late Classical (fourth- century B.C.) Athens attest few securely identified personifications--illustrations of abstract ideas and other nonhuman entities in human form- an abundance of per-</page><page sequence="17">1997 ] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 347 sonifications is attested by ancient writers. That some personifications served political purposes is also attested by the ancients, although most of the works cited are mon- umental paintings that have entirely perished. A few ex- tant sculptural monuments, however, illustrate such per- sonifications. These sculptures range from the monumental (Kephisodotos's statue of Eirene and Ploutos) to the mun- dane (document reliefs). To these classes of sculptures that bore personifications should be added relief-decorated statue bases. It has been conjectured recently that personifications are present on the Atarbos Base (Acropolis Museum 1338). Another fragment of a relief base on display at the Fitz- william Museum, Cambridge (GR 99.1937), also seems to represent a personification. This relief illustrates a stand- ing female whose pose and attire are reminiscent of other personifications shown in mid-fourth century sculptures. Her distinguishing attributes, however-veil and laurel wreath -permit her to be identified as Boule, the person- ification of the (Athenian) Council. The comparable illus- trations of Boule, usually with an honorand, on document reliefs are unsurprising, as Boule actually issued the pub- lic honors. Accordingly, one might then conjecture that Boule's appearance on this statue base implies that this fragment was part of a much larger monument that also commemorated civic honors bestowed on an individual (or a group). HELLENISTIC MILITARY VICTORY MONUMENTS: THE CASE OF THE ATTALID KINGDOM AT PERGAMON, CA. 260-133 B.C.: Thomas M. Brogan, Bryn Mawr College One of the fundamental forms of Attalid representa- tion was the commemoration of military victory. The prac- tice, first attested under Eumenes I, was maintained and greatly expanded by his successors. The Athena precinct on the Pergamene citadel was the most important setting for these monuments; others were dedicated at Athens, Delphi, and Delos. Previous research on the topic has fo- cused on the form and date of a few specific examples, including Attalos I's representations of the Gauls and the Great Altar. In attempting to present a general picture of the practice at Pergamon, I draw attention in this paper to the fact that there were almost 40 Attalid triumphal dedications on the Pergamene citadel alone. The paper provides a general discussion of the memo- rial types--architectural complexes, sculptural displays, captured armor, and captured art- and some of the difficul- ties presented by the fragmentary nature of this evidence. While the actual dedications are not always discernible, the content of both metrical and more historically explicit epigrams is particularly revealing. Most were erected by the kings, but a number were put up by Pergamene and allied soldiers. The picture that emerges highlights the importance of celebrating and commemorating these victories. Not every victory was celebrated with equal pomp and energy, how- ever, nor do the form and numbers always equate with the perceived historical significance of the battle. Further con- siderations involve a number of factors: the nature of the enemy, the amount of captured booty, and the relative posi- tion of the victory within a king's reign. VOTIVE OFFERINGS AT PAESTUM: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN CULT PRACTICE AT THE TEMPLE OF CERES: Rebecca Miller Ammerman, Colgate Uni- versity, and Marina Cipriani, Museo archeologico di Paestum Since the 18th century, the temple standing in the north- ern sector of the Greek colony of Paestum has been called the "Temple of Ceres." While the Doric architecture of the temple has drawn much interest, it is only since 1993 that attention has turned to the systematic study of the votive offerings and other artifacts recovered from the grounds of its sanctuary. The research conducted over the past three years has focused on some 3,100 miniature votive vases and 8,700 terracotta figurines. Our analysis of this material reveals distinctive patterns in ritual practice for each of three main periods. For the Greek period of the sanctuary's history, dedication of miniature hydriae is frequent. Terra- cotta figurines are less common and usually represent the generic image of an enthroned goddess. From the later fifth century B.C. throughout the time of Lucanian hege- mony, the dedication of miniature vases dwindles while that of figurines (with several clearly portraying Athena) increases. Finally, with the foundation of the Latin colony in 273 B.C., there is even more marked change. Miniature vases no longer serve as offerings, but the number and icono- graphic variety of the figurines surge ahead. Eros and Mi- nerva rival one another for pride of place among figurines representing a deity (which include Hermaphrodite and Dionysos), and male banqueters and female dancers abound. The imagery of the figurines confirms the lon- gevity of Athena's propitiation, while the notable expan- sion of the iconographic repertoire reveals radical mod- ifications introduced to the cult by the Latin colonists. SESSION IIB: BRONZE AGE STUDIES: CRETE, THERA, GREECE, EGYPT A STRATIFIED TOMB DEPOSIT FROM ARCHANES: TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF THE MM I-IIA POT- TERY PHASES IN CENTRAL CRETE: Christofilis Mag- gidis, Campus College, Athens Burial building 19, a Minoan collective tomb in the pre- historic cemetery of Phourni at Archanes, is of particular interest for its unique architectural form, abundant evi- dence for burial customs and social ranking, and, above all, for the undisturbed and stratified Middle Minoan I-IIA pottery deposit that it yielded, which includes 195 com- plete and fragmentary vases, more than 100 characteristic sherds, and 15 larnakes, in a great variety of shapes and decoration. The careful excavation and study of the tomb revealed a well-defined stratification of four successive burial lay-</page><page sequence="18">348 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 ers and a tripartite pattern in the distribution of the finds in each layer (the earliest finds near or against the walls, the subsequent ones in the central area, and the latest finds at the entrance). This pattern facilitated further chrono- logical classification into subdivisions within each phase and formed the basis for a detailed definition of the pot- tery sequence. Study of this rich pottery deposit and of extant com- paranda from Archanes and other cemeteries and settle- ments defines the typological and technological evolution of MM I-IIA pottery in central Crete on stratigraphical grounds, thus affecting the traditional dating of several pottery deposits in the region. Furthermore, the existence of local pottery workshops is confirmed, trade contacts are detected with other regions of Crete, and a funerary use is identified for certain pottery types. AFRICAN VERVETS ON CRETE AND THERA DURING MM IIIB-LM IA: PatriciaJ. Parker, University of Texas at Austin In this paper I explore the presence and function of African vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) on six MM III B-LM IA frescoes from Crete and Thera. These fres- coes show us that vervets (native to Egypt during this period) were imported to Crete as part of an elite gift exchange. By studying the specific physiological details presented on the frescoes and systematically comparing these to the extant populations of Cercopithecus in Africa, I conclude that a subspecies of C. aethiops is represented in sufficient detail to suggest that the artists had firsthand experience with the monkeys. The monkeys were received with the full force and ap- peal of their exotic status and anthropomorphic form. At Akrotiri (Xeste 3, room 3a) we find a fully bipedal (anthro- pomorphic) monkey placed in a liminal zone halfway up a tripartite shrine, handing an offering of saffron to a god- dess. Other frescoes show monkeys in powerful anthro- pomorphic situations and wielding artifacts such as a lyre and a sword. Building on previous work, I explore the monkeys' role as exotics holding intrinsic power by virtue of their for- eign origin. We see this phenomenon throughout the Ae- gean in the plenitude of nonindigenous objects in graves. An object from the heavens and one from a distant land may well have held related power for prehistoric peoples. THE BLUE MONKEYS OF THE AEGEAN AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR BRONZE AGE TRADE: Thomas E Strasser, California State University, Sacramento In this paper I contend that the blue monkeys of the Bronze Age Aegean frescoes indicate the actual importa- tion of monkeys to the Aegean. The monkeys are painted in sufficient detail to identify the genus, and to suggest that the motifs were based on actual observation. The only monkeys that naturally exist on the Mediterranean shores are the Barbary macaques. Since the Barbary macaque is tailless, it is not the species in the frescoes. The monkeys in the frescoes must be sub-Saharan, and are most likely the vervet monkey. There is also published but problem- atical fossil evidence for monkeys on Thera. The frescoes suggest a trade network in monkeys via Egypt from their natural environment in sub-Saharan Africa. That network was at least 1,000 miles in length, and is one of the longest in the Aegean Bronze Age. Unlike other long-distance com- modities, however, monkeys have a limited "shelf life" and require far greater care than inanimate trade items. The pragmatic constraints in transporting monkeys would require great care that necessitated handlers and a proper food supply. Once on the Aegean islands, the mon- keys probably did not roam free, as depicted on the fres- coes, because troops of monkeys are notoriously detri- mental to agricultural crops. More likely the monkeys were leashed, caged, and cared for. Moreover, the winters may have been deleterious to this tropical species, requiring some sort of housing. The commerce in monkeys was a very long and labor-intensive trade network to the Aegean during the Bronze Age. BLUE WARE AND THE HISTORY OF THE KARPHI SET- TLEMENT: Leslie Preston Day, Wabash College Karphi has served as a type site for the transition be- tween the Bronze and Iron Ages on Crete since its exca- vation by the British in the 1930s. My new study of the surviving material from the site aims at fuller analysis and publication of the pottery and seeks to answer questions about the date and nature of the settlement. An unusual feature of the Karphi ceramic assemblage is a fabric iden- tified by the excavators as Blue ware. I have identified two types of Blue ware: the first a result of misfiring in a kiln, the second caused by secondary exposure to fire. The misfired pottery is blue-gray, brittle, and warped, similar to pieces from a LM IIIC potter's kiln or Late Geometric cremations at Kavousi. Vessels of this type were concen- trated in the Temple. The second type of Blue ware is burned fine ware; it is distinguishable from the cooking wares by fabric and color. A high percentage of the whole vessels, presumably those in use at the end of the settle- ment, show extensive traces of burning; these are not local- ized but occur all over the site. The significant amount of burned pottery calls into question the excavators' con- clusion that the site was abandoned and suggests wide- spread burning. Although the excavators placed the end of the site in the Subminoan period, no Subminoan ves- sels like those from Kavousi or Knossos occur in the final assemblages, so this destruction should be dated to the very end of the LM IIIC period. REEXAMINATION OF THE MYCENAEAN CEMETERIES IN THEBES: TAPHONOMIC OBSERVATIONS AND POTTERY CLASSIFICATION: Hara Tzavella-Evjen, University of Colorado, Boulder, and Janet Stultz, Boulder Society The Mycenaean cemeteries in Thebes, which were ex- cavated by A. Keramopoulos nearly a century ago, are un- der study for republication. The burials and the pottery are examined in light of new data and studies from the regions of Thebes and Attica. It can now be affirmed that 1) one chamber tomb was plastered and had painted dec-</page><page sequence="19">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 349 oration; 2) clay and wooden sarcophagi were used, the lat- ter being plastered; 3) cremation was extensively practiced, possibly as early as Mycenaean I or II in one case; and 4) a favored positioning of the dead in inhumations was su- pine with knees bent. It appears that the tombs contained a high percentage of children's burials. Canine bones were also found inside two tombs, suggesting dog sacrifices. Sev- eral of these features set Thebans apart from the rest of the Mycenaeans, and some practices show close ties with Attica. The pottery can now be more precisely dated and places the cemeteries from the Early Mycenaean to Early Geometric with varying frequencies of use within each period. The pottery shapes are generally among those com- monly used as burial goods. Some are types appropriate for burial rites, a few are associated with rituals not nec- essarily related to burial rites, and some are of domestic forms. The presence, frequency, or absence of specific pot- tery shapes provides another avenue to place Theban burials into context with Mycenaean cemeteries in the rest of Boeotia, Euboea, and Attica. THE TOMB OF PANEHESY AT TELL EL-AMARNA: Laurel Flentye, Institute of Fine Arts, New York Uni- versity The Tomb of Panehesy is located in the northern group of rock-cut tombs at modern Tell el-Amarna, ancient Ak- hetaten, in Egypt. It is dated to the reign of the pharaoh Akhenaten in the New Kingdom period, ca. 1353-1335 B.C. The decorative program provides a narrative linking the iconography of Akhenaten and Nefertiti with the architec- ture of the site. References to specific buildings in the dec- orative program elucidate the religious and political na- ture of Akhenaten's rule at Amarna. It is within this framework that the role of Panehesy as chief servitor to the Aten is defined within the tomb's narrative. The reign of Akhenaten emphasized the worship of one deity, namely the sun disk. This revolutionary iconography f,: cusing upon the Aten, or sun disk, and the royal family brcie with previous traditional forms. The site of Amarna possessed major constructions but they were dismantled by subsequent rulers. For this reason, the rock-cut tombs of Amarna provide a visual record of the layout of the city. Thus, the Tomb of Panehesy provides a direct link between the deceased and the world of the living. As the Metropolitan Museum is planning a reinstalla. tion of its Amarna galleries and an exhibition, the subject of Amarna and its related objects is a current one. Thus, the Tomb of Panehesy will provide an interesting insight into the period. SESSION IIC: REPORTS FROM THE FIELD HALAI, 1996: Mary Eliot and John E. Coleman, Cor- nell University, and Susan Allen, Bryn Mawr College Excavations by the Cornell Halai and East Lokris Proj- ect resumed at Halai in 1996. As in previous campaigns, the project served as a field school. The 1996 season fo- cused on the Neolithic remains in area F, the "temple area" of later times. New trenches linked the major area of ex- posure with test trench F1 to the south. Area F now ap- pears to be near the original southwestern edge of the mound on which the Neolithic town was situated. The edge of the mound was somewhat eroded after the town's aban- donment in Late Neolithic times. The large LN structure BL near the northern edge of our exposure comprises a deep band of stones within a ditch with sloping sides; its purpose is unclear. Early and Middle Neolithic structures have a complex history and were modified and built upon as ground level rose. A unique vessel with a nozzle at one side, perhaps used as a bellows, was found in association with a small collapsed LN oven. The pottery classification was revised by Susan Allen, and clay samples were collected for comparative purposes. Lithics are being studied by Susan Petrakis and Lia Karimali, botanical samples by Amy Bogaard. Many samples were collected for radiocarbon dating. THE ACROPOLIS OF GERAKI, LACONIA: THE 1995 AND 1996 SEASONS: A. Prent andJ.H. Crouwel, Univer- sity of Amsterdam In 1995 members of the Department of Mediterranean Archaeology at the University of Amsterdam began a fieldwork project in Geraki in east-central Laconia. The acropolis of Geraki was known in antiquity as Geronthrai, an important perioikic town mentioned in inscriptions and ancient literary sources. Brief excavations by A.J.B. Wace and EW. Hasluck in 1905 indicated that the origin of the site may go back to the Early Helladic period. The aim of the new investigations is to reveal Geraki's long history in greater detail. The primary goal is to de- termine the chronological range of human occupation as well as the size and function of the site in each period. Of special interest are the date and function of the "mega- lithic" wall around the top of the acropolis, which so far have remained uncertain. The first two seasons of the Geraki project involved the systematic collection and counting of surface finds, the drawing of detailed topographical maps, a geophysical sur- vey, and the study of architectural remains, including the acropolis wall. Preliminary study suggests that Classical- Hellenistic material is densely distributed over much of the upper and north slopes. Archaic fine ware and min- iature pots, probably indicative of cult activities, were en- countered along the southwest slope. Concentrations of EH and MH pottery and obsidian were noted at the two rocky summits of the acropolis, but finds of firm Myce- naean date are so far lacking- an observation that casts doubt on dating the acropolis wall to this period. ILLUMINATING THE "DARK AGE": AN EXAMINATION OF THE EARLY IRON AGE POTTERY FROM TEGEA: Mary E. Voyatzis, University of Arizona In the recent Norwegian excavation campaign at the sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea (1990-1996), we uncov- ered a bothros below the metalworking area inside the pro-</page><page sequence="20">350 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 naos of the fourth-century B.C. temple. It contained a large amount of pottery as well as animal bones, carbon, and small objects of terracotta, bronze, and gold. The best rep- resented and most distinctive type of pottery found in the bothros is similar to pottery of the so-called Laconian Dark Age style. The Tegean fabric, however, is usually a paler reddish-yellow color, and the decoration or shapes of some of the pots are sometimes unparalleled in the Laconian repertoire. Unlike Laconia, moreover, some of the pottery from Tegea reveals conventional Early Geometric shapes and decoration, but it also has the same fabric and shiny, metallic paint as our "Laconian Dark Age" sherds. Tegea's ca. 1,100 "Laconian Dark Age" sherds almost equal the ca. 1,250 uncovered at Amyklai; the other Laconian sites have yielded only small amounts of this material. A significant feature of the pottery found at Tegea is that it comes from moderately well-stratified layers; strati- graphic information is essentially unavailable for the ma- terial from the Laconian sites. We have not yet reached the bottom of the bothros, but the lowest excavated strata contain "Laconian Dark Age" sherds mixed with Early Geo- metric (together with a small amount of Mycenaean and Protogeometric material as well). In the progressively higher levels, there is also Middle Geometric I through Late Geo- metric II sherds. We thus appear to have the opportunity to trace the development of the "Laconian Dark Age" pot- tery at Tegea from the period when Early Geometric be- gins, ca. 900-730 B.C., though it gradually dwindles out in the upper strata. It is clear that this new hoard of pot- tery from Tegea will permit us better to understand the "Laconian Dark Age" material from many perspectives. Fi- nally, a potentially significant contribution to this study may result from a chemical analysis project, which is cur- rently underway. We hope to determine if the Tegean pot- tery was made in the same place as the "Laconian Dark Age" sherds from Amyklai or if two (or more) different production centers can be discerned. In either case, this large collection of Early Iron Age pottery from Tegea now provides us with the opportunity to begin to illuminate this elusive "Dark Age" period. KAMENSKA CHUKA, BULGARIA: ITS ARCHITECTURE AND ECONOMY: Mark Stefanovich, American Uni- versity in Bulgaria, and H. Arthur Bankoff Brook- lyn College During the Late Bronze Age, Macedonia witnessed a confrontation between the centrally organized economy of the Mycenaean palatial system, with an accounting sys- tem using Linear B script, and a peripheral economy with no attested writing or accounting system, established on a dispersed village settlement pattern. The latest excava- tions at Kamenska Chuka (near Blagoevgrad, southwest Bul- garia) in the middle Struma River basin suggest that this site could be part of an outreach network based on an emporium/distribution center. The architecture of the two- story structure with massive 2-m-thick walls attests to the importance of Kamenska Chuka in the 14th century B.C. It stands at the crossroads of influences penetrating north from the Aegean world and those moving south from the Danube River basin, as well as those traversing east-west. THE NEW HISTORY OF IDALION: Pamela Gaber, Uni- versity of Arizona Since 1992, members of the University of Arizona Ex- pedition to Idalion, Cyprus under my direction have been excavating during the summer at the site of the ancient city-kingdom of Idalion, 18 km south of Nicosia. In the spring and autumn, members of the Department of An- tiquities of the Republic of Cyprus excavated on the west- ern acropolis of Idalion under the direction of Maria Hadjicosti. By working together closely using modern tech- niques including remote sensing, these two projects have managed to change our understanding of the history and demographic functioning of one of the premier city-states of the late second and first millennia in Cyprus. A new picture of Idalion is emerging, one which includes a Late Bronze Age industrial zone and a monumental, cen- trally organized building, as well as the necropolis formerly known from the period. The industrial complex continued into the Iron Age, with Geometric remains indicating con- tinuity into the previously known Lower City domestic and industrial complexes. The Archaic period of the Lower City has now been exposed, and Near Eastern connections in the Adonis Temenos on eastern acropolis of Idalion have been identified. International cooperation has been key to the recent successes at Idalion. EXCAVATIONS AT A RURAL CYPRO-ARCHAIC SANCTU- ARY IN POLIS-PERISTERIES BY THE PRINCETON CY- PRUS EXPEDITION: 1988-1991 AND 1994-1996: Joanna S. Smith, Cyprus American Archaeolog- ical Research Institute This report presents results of seven years (1988-1991, 1994-1996) of excavation by Princeton University at a Cypro-Archaic (ca. 750 to 475 B.C.) sanctuary located in Polis-Peristeries, part of the region of Cyprus encompassed by the Iron Age city-kingdom of Marion. The sanctuary has four distinct architectural phases spanning the eighth through the fifth centuries B.C. The third phase dates to the sixth century and preserves a vast array of dedications in primary contexts on floors and in pits. The most prom- inent features of this phase are a temenos wall, a road, an altar, two major sanctuary buildings, and a large pit or bothros used for the disposal of materials from the sanc- tuary at the time of its destruction by fire at the end of the sixth century. Excavation since 1994 has focused on the bothros. Mea- suring 6.0 to 6.5 m in diameter and 3.0 m in depth, this pit preserves a well-stratified series of Iron Age deposits including pottery, terracottas, metal remains, stone arti- facts, architectural debris, and both faunal and floral re- mains. Because both the bothros and the sanctuary build- ings provide an unprecedented amount of evidence not only for the nature of dedications at the sanctuary, but</page><page sequence="21">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 351 also for the nature of dining at the site, study of this site informs us about the structure and function of Iron Age sanctuaries for the individual and communal display of wealth on Cyprus. EXCAVATIONS AT KOURION'S AMATHUS GATE CEME- TERY, 1995-1996: Danielle A. Parks, University of Missouri-Columbia Cesnola, the British Museum, Lord Kitchener, a French vicomte, the University of Pennsylvania, the Department of Antiquities, not to mention larcenous villagers, have all sampled Kourion's Amathus Gate Cemetery, but little is recorded, let alone published. The cemetery follows the Amathus road, beginning outside the settlement's east gate, ranging south and north of the acropolis. The area cur- rently under investigation lies above the modern access road, extending back into the acropolis cliffs. The Cyprus American Archaeological Research Insti- tute sponsored the 1995 and 1996 seasons under my di- rection. Eight trenches opened in 1995 revealed remains of seven Early Roman chamber tombs equipped with pro- visions for libations, extensive quarrying probably of the late third or fourth century, and a dense cemetery of Late Roman cist tombs (fourth or fifth century, or possibly even later). These fossae contained multiple inhumations ac- companied by jewelry and coins. In 1996 I continued ex- ploring this region, and a survey team began mapping the section to the north, where there are clear indications of many more tombs. The excavation of Kourion's Amathus Gate Cemetery presents a rare opportunity to study the evolution of a Roman necropolis from the first century to the fifth, span- ning the transition from paganism to Christianity. The lack of modern architectural overburden permits a clear view of the cemetery layout, including accommodations for tomb markers and funerary ritual. Nothing in the later burials identifies them as Christian, but the fact that they date to this period of transition renders them significant. THE TANNINIM ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, 1996: Robert R. Stieglitz, Rutgers University, Newark The first season of excavations by the Tanninim Archae- ological Project took place at the coastal site of Tel Tan- ninim (Tell al-Malat), located about 5 km north of Caesarea. Excavation in area A established the upper stratigraphy of the high mound (Byzantine through Crusader eras). Per- sian and Hellenistic ceramics in the fill attest to the earlier settlement remains- a town known as Krokodeilon polis from literary sources. In area B, we found a very well-preserved Byzantine castellum complex, with adjacent piscina and other installations. The water was piped into the lacus from the high-level aqueduct to Caesarea. The Crusader name of the site was evidently Turris Salinarum, a toponym already attested in Talmudic sources as Migdal Malha or "Tower of Saltworks." EXCAVATIONS AT PALIK1', 1995: Laura Maniscalco McConnell, Soprintendenza ai Beni Culturali ed Ambientali di Catania Along the road from Mt. Etna to Sicily's southern shore the ruins of an ancient city atop the Rocchicella (Mineo) have caught the attention of travelers from the time of Tommaso Fazello (in the 16th century). The well-preserved structures on Rocchicella's summit, the cave on its south- eastern flank, and the boiling naptha lake nearby all recall the city of Palik6, capital of the short-lived Sikel state of Ducetius, who dared to rebel against the Greeks in the mid-fifth century B.C. Excavation in 1960 by L. Bernab6 Brea and P. Pelagatti confirmed the existence of a fifth- century city atop the Rocchicella and discovered remains identified as an Archaic temple in front of the cave that had been frequented since Palaeolithic times. In 1995 the Catania Superintendency opened 15 trenches in both sectors, placing the results of excavations 30 years ago in the context of new discoveries. On the summit the city displays a regular plan and an acropolis where parts of a stylobate mark a temple that may never have been completed. In front of the cave a street cuts across the area, above the remains of the Archaic structure, arriving at a stairway that leads to the acropolis. Across this street the remains of a monumental structure 25 m long, built in blocks of drafted masonry, appear to be those of a fifth- century temple with pronaos and opisthodomos. This dra- matic arrangement would seem to confirm the identifica- tion of the site as Palik6. SESSION IID: ARCHAEOLOGY ON FILM AND TELEVISION THE TYRANNY OF "BROADCAST QUALITY" AND AR- CHAEOLOGY FILMS: Peter S. Allen, Rhode Island College Throughout the 1950s and 1960s few films with archae- ological content were shown on television, but in the early 1970s the enormous television success of films based on the books of Erich van Daniken created a demand for a new type of archaeological film characterized by varying degrees of sensationalism. "Chariots of the Gods" was not scientific; in fact, it is among the worst examples of how science can be misused, but it utilized, albeit erroneously, archaeological subject matter and thus demonstrated the popular appetite for films with archaeological themes. Pub- lic interest in archaeology was further stimulated by the wild success of the world tour of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamen and several documentaries were produced on this exhibit and widely shown on television. About the same time we can chronicle the appearance of a new stan- dard, "broadcast quality," a phrase that has increasingly found its way into funding source guidelines and refers to the idea that the finished product would have to be good enough to be broadcast on television - i.e., to be accept-</page><page sequence="22">352 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 able to the individuals and committees making program- ming decisions at both the networks and public television stations. This paper examines how this standard affected the production of films on archaeology in subsequent years and how it continues to tyrannize the industry. ADJUSTING THE FOCUS: ARCHAEOLOGY ON NATIONAL TELEVISION: Carole Lazio, National Museum of the American Indian Seen from a national perspective, a wide gulf exists to- day between scholars of archaeology and people who evalu- ate educational documentaries, broadcasters who dissem- inate and fund them, and mediamakers who put them together. The long delays between the national release of the first productions about van Daniken's theories and about Mel Fisher's discovery of the Atocha and the national broad- cast of productions placing these developments in their proper scientific contexts illustrate the gravity of the problem. This chasm was not always so deep, and in some parts of the country today, building on groundwork established in the early days of television, a better rapport seems to exist between archaeologists and local broadcasters. But market forces affecting the production and release of work about the field on a national scale have changed dramat- ically since the 1950s. Paradoxically, today's proliferation of television outlets has emerged at a time when factors encouraging glib, glossy treatment of archaeology are in- tensifying while practical support for the field itself is threat- ened from many quarters. It is as essential for American scholars to find ways to reverse popular misperceptions of the field as it is to se- cure support for their academic endeavors. Indeed the two may prove to be inseparable. WHO CONTROLS THE VISION OF THE PAST? Ted W Tim- reck, Spofford Films, New York No one can doubt that moving-image documentation (although still underutilized in the field of archaeology) is a major step forward, adding motion, scale, and relational position to the older traditions of field illustration and still photography. In addition to being a field tool, it has also become our best window into the physical and intel- lectual process of archaeology. As we attempt to commu- nicate this process to wider audiences and future genera- tions, we find ourselves asking whether the commanding popularity of the medium (especially on television) might not be changing the discipline itself. Who is in control of the public's idea of the past? Is marketing shaping our vision of history or does marketing only reinforce a vision of his- tory that is already firmly held? What are the implications for a culture that simultaneously holds different versions of the past? Is the television archaeology of today an ac- curate reflection of a potential crisis? Is television's idea of the past creating a "we" and "they" confrontational split between scientists and the public, or does a gulf already exist indicating that the search for "Lost Worlds" is the nat- ural result? VISUALIZING ARCHAEOLOGY: PROBLEMS AND PROS- PECTS: Nicholas S. Nicastro, Cornell University The actual methods of archaeology make nearly static impressions that are rarely interesting to visualize on film or video. Many filmmakers therefore equate the discipline with prestige objects, or perpetuate misleading notions of exoticism, romance, and/or detective-style adventure. These distortions persist despite a rising crisis of conscience in archaeology itself. The ongoing attempts of some na- tive peoples to control remains are putting many archae- ologists and museums on the defensive, forcing them to justify the role of their discipline in the wider society. Doc- umentary films have an important role to play in this de- bate. Instead of retreading familiar themes of treasure- hoarding, human sacrifice, and war, films should examine not only what is dug up, but why, by whom, and for what purpose. Filmmakers wishing to justify archaeological in- vestigation can help the public understand both its results and its relevance. MAKING THE AFRICAN BURIAL GROUND: David Kutz, Kutz Television According to renowned documentary director Willard Van Dyke, "direct observation is the only way to arrive at a truthful and successful presentation." This idea, which is also fundamental to archaeology, was the basis for our approach in The African Burial Ground: An American Discov- ery, a series of four half-hour videotapes on the discovery and excavation of an important African-American ceme- tery in lower Manhattan. Videotape is not a good medium for creating a visual archive of an archaeological site, but it is an excellent me- dium for providing information and involving a general audience. We achieved this in a number of ways. These programs include dozens of interviews with individuals as well as scenes of the site and laboratories where arti- facts and skeletons were studied. We believe that docu- mentaries should embody dramatic storytelling to engage the audience and thus strive to make complicated infor- mation and ideas accessible to a general audience. In this paper we discuss how this was accomplished through the editorial process, the narrative, music, and the use of"historic" images. We also include observations on the conflict that developed between the United States General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency responsible for the archaeological site, the under- writers of the film, and members of the African-American community. THE SPHAKIA SURVEY VIDEO: Lucia Nixon and Simon Price, Oxford University What is an archaeological field survey? We have pro- duced a video that tries to answer the question by looking at the work of the Sphakia Survey. Archaeologists have used video for internal recording purposes before, but making a video to present the methods and results of an archae- ological project is new. The Sphakia Survey is an archaeo-</page><page sequence="23">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 353 logical field project whose general objective is to recon- struct the sequence of human activity in a remote part of southwestern Crete from the time that people arrived (ca. 3000 B.C.) until A.D. 1900, the end of the Turkish/Ottoman period. We decided to make a video about the Survey because still images are not good at showing how specialists work- ing on an international project could contribute to a com- mon interpretation. All four principal investigators- Jennifer Moody and Lucia Nixon (co-directors), Simon Price (historian), and Oliver Rackham (historical ecologist)- appear in the video. After preliminary filming by Price, we obtained the services of Charles Beesley (video unit, Oxford University). Nixon, Price, and Beesley have edited the television-quality footage into a 50-minute videotape, designed both to be shown to university classes studying the ancient world and to a wider public. The aim of this paper is to explore some of the choices, intellectual and practical, that were involved in the making of the video. SESSION HE: COLLOQUIUM: NEW RESEARCH AT APHRODISIAS IN CARIA THE SCULPTURE OF APHRODISIAS: FIVE YEARS OF RE- SEARCH AND DOCUMENTATION: R.R.R. Smith, Oxford University Since the death of Kenan Erim, five years of research have been devoted by a team from New York University and its Institute of Fine Arts to the documentation, con- servation, study, and publication of the many marble sculp- tures of the Roman period found at Aphrodisias in Caria between 1961 and 1990. This paper describes the structure, aims, and methods of this research program and highlights some of its main results. The results concern both individual monuments and the shape and character of the city's sculptural production as a whole. Due to the site's extraordinary rate of marble preservation, the statue landscape of the Roman town can be described in unusual detail from a combined study of its surviving marbles and inscribed bases. Recent work doc- uments, for example, the urban and political context of the far-reaching changes in the nature and deployment of public statue honors between the High and Late Empire. THE CITY PLAN OF APHRODISIAS: Christopher Ratte, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University The extensive excavations directed by Kenan Erim con- centrated on the sacred and public buildings of central Aphrodisias. These investigations showed that Aphrodisias's civic center was built up over several generations begin- ning in the late first century B.C., in a monumental pro- gram centered around two orthogonally planned public squares. The area outside the city center remained by con- trast largely unexplored, and even in the city center, atten- tion was focused more on the architecture of individual buildings than on the connections between them and their larger urban presence. The current research program seeks to gain a better understanding both of the development of the city center and of the relationship between the city center and the city as a whole. New investigations, combining architectural recording, limited excavation, surface survey, and geophysical prospec- tion, have shown that Aphrodisias was laid out on a grid plan in the tradition of such earlier planned cities as Priene and Miletos. The orthogonal planning of the agora and city center was thus not an isolated undertaking, but part of a larger urban design. The date of this new plan is un- certain, and it may be as late as the monumental devel- opment of the city center in the late first century B.C. A possible earlier date is the time of the sympoliteia between Aphrodisias and the neighboring city of Plarasa, in the late second or early first century. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BOULEUTERION AT APHRO- DISIAS: Lionel Bier, Brooklyn College The ongoing survey at Aphrodisias has permitted the unhurried recording of the small theater-like building on the northern edge of the agora first brought to light dur- ing the excavations of the 1960s. The new documentation makes it possible to distinguish building phases and to re- construct with an unusual degree of certainty the form of the monument at different stages of its history. The build- ing as it stands today belongs essentially to the second or early third century A.D. and is thus roughly contemporary with a number of similar monuments in Asia Minor and elsewhere in the Roman world. Its closest parallel is the Bouleuterion at Ephesos, which acquired its final form in the mid-second century. Indeed, so close are the buildings in size, topographic situation, and in the major elements of their design that direct influence is possible. Whatever the means of transmission, the connection is hardly for- tuitous. Aphrodisias enjoyed homonoic relations with the larger, politically more important metropolis. Claudia An- tonia Tatiana, a prominent Aphrodisian in the Severan period whose statue was erected in front of the Bouleu- terion along with that of her uncle, had strong ties with Ephesos. It also appears that the Bouleuterion was part of a larger program of urban building and analogies with Ephesos suggest that the existing Council House covers the remains of an earlier one for which there is some archae- ological and epigraphic evidence. THE SCULPTURE OF THE BOULEUTERION AT APHRO- DISIAS: Christopher H. Hallett, University of Wash- ington Inside the Bouleuterion was found a considerable part of the original sculptural decoration of the building-10 marble statues and several other more fragmentary figures. This collection of sculpture offers valuable new evidence for several areas of research. First, the complex is unusual in the extent to which its sculptural ornament survives, and it increases our knowl- edge considerably about the display of honorific and dec- orative statuary in public buildings. For example, it con-</page><page sequence="24">354 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 tained seven portraits of leading Aphrodisians: five standing figures marked out as the priests and priestesses of im- portant local cults; and two seated ones, in the guise of literary figures - poets or philosophers. This range of por- trait images reveals much about the values and the self- image of the provincial aristocracy of Aphrodisias in the early third century A.D., the period to which the original sculptural program probably dates. Second, this material throws interesting light on the re- lationship between Late Antique society and its Classical past. For the whole building, together with its sculpture, was painstakingly reerected in the fifth century A.D. All of the statues from the scaenaefrons show signs of having been badly broken-as if they all had fallen in an earthquake - and of having undergone a series of substan- tial repairs. This demonstrates the high value that was placed on the city's old civic monuments in Late Antiquity, and the considerable expenses that the leading citizens were prepared to incur in order to maintain them. THE STADIUM AT APHRODISIAS: Katherine Welch, Har- vard University The stadium's imposing marble auditorium is 270 m long and contains 30 tiers of seating with space for 30,000 people, making it one of the largest stadia in the ancient world, as well as the single best preserved ancient stadium. We are currently engaged in a detailed architectural record- ing of this stadium (including a state plan at 1:50). Its seats are covered with inscriptions that provide evidence for social stratification. The architecture indicates that the stadium was used both for traditional Greek athletic games as well as Roman spectacles. The building's plan is an un- usual variation on the standard Graeco-Roman stadium plan, which is U-shaped, having one flat and one curved end. Our stadium has two curved ends and a pronounced entasis. Formally, it is a conflation of the traditional U-shaped Greek stadium and oval Roman amphitheater. Inscriptions indicate that this type of stadium had a specific name: o6rdtou tq~tCptaTpou. Aphrodisias was a Greek city that became prominent only under Roman rule and indeed because of Roman patronage. In such a city, a new Graeco- Roman building type for public entertainment would have been especially fitting. The stadium has no vaulting be- neath its auditorium for spectator circulation, suggesting that it was built before the second century. This Aphro- disian, hybrid type of stadium was most probably the prod. uct of a specific set of cultural circumstances of the Early Empire, an architecturally dynamic period when Greece was first adapting to Roman rule. BLACK-AND-WHITE SCULPTURE FROM THE SCULPTOR'S WORKSHOP AT APHRODISIAS:Julie A. Van Voorhis, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University This paper explores aspects of ancient sculpture pro- duction at Aphrodisias as demonstrated by a group of sophisticated black-and-white pieces that can be associated with the so-called Sculptor's Workshop, located north of the Bouleuterion. Finds from the North Bouleuterion area include physical facilities related to the production of sculp- ture, stone-carving tools, and a broad range of statuary in various sizes and states of completion. A date for the de- struction of the Sculptor's Workshop in the fourth century A.D. is provided by an unfinished portrait statue; this offers a probable terminus ante quem for the black-and-white pieces as well. The black-and-white sculptures are carved from single blocks of local marble, quarried from an area where the dark blue-gray and white layers meet in a distinct seam. An unfinished statuette of Europa in this technique was discovered inside the workshop building; two similar stat- uettes with no recorded provenance - a black-winged Eros and a partially draped Aphrodite -can be linked to this workshop on technical grounds. Additional dark and two- toned fragments from the Sculptor's Workshop, from other areas of the site, and in the collections of other museums are examined for possible connections. The pieces are also discussed within the larger context of sculptural produc- tion in Late Antiquity. With their virtuoso technique, small size, and pagan subject matter, the black-and-white stat- uettes from Aphrodisias can be loosely associated with a larger group of finely worked statuettes from varied prov- enances produced primarily to decorate lavish Late An- tique houses. THE NORTH TEMENOS HOUSE AT APHRODISIAS: AR- CHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE: Sheila Dillon, Cha- pel Hill Society This paper presents the results of the study of the ar- chitecture and sculptural decoration of the so-called North Temenos House at Aphrodisias. This complex, located 15 m north of the Temple of Aphrodite just outside the temple temenos, was most likely a private house, one of a number of grand city residences of the Late Roman and Early Byz- antine periods excavated at the site. The North Temenos House, which shares a wall with the temple temenos, ex- tends about 26 m north-south and 50 m east-west, cov- ering an area of 1300 m2. In size and plan it is comparable to the grand townhouses of fifth-century Athens, such as the so-called House of Proclus south of the Acropolis. The North Temenos House was lavishly decorated with mosa- ics, wall paintings, and sculpture. The rooms of the house, which include an atrium with marble-lined pool and a small tetrastyle court, were centered around a large apsidal hall, revetted and paved in marble. Much of this marble revet- ment decoration, including fluted pilasters, bases, and figured capitals, is preserved. This paper discusses the building phases and chronology of the North Temenos House, offers a reconstruction of the decorative program of the apsidal hall, and considers the relationship of the house to the temenos of the Temple of Aphrodite. THE SACRED IDENTITY OF APHRODISIAS IN THE EP- IGRAPHIC EVIDENCE: Angelos Chaniotis, New York University Theophoric place-names, like Aphrodisias, are very com- mon, and equally common is the close association of a</page><page sequence="25">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 355 polis with a major sanctuary. In this respect, Aphrodisias presents the anything but unique case of a community named after the major deity it worshipped, gradually appro- priating the myths and properties of the patron goddess, and exploiting them for the construction of an identity and the endorsement of diplomatic enterprises. Exceptional in the case of Aphrodisias is only the wealthy source ma- terial that permits a better study of this phenomenon from the early first century B.C. to Late Antiquity. The role played by Aphrodite in the civic life, self-representation, and col- lective memory of the Aphrodisians is evident in the ep- igraphic material summarized in this paper (the ideolog- ical connotations of Aphrodite's epithets and attributes, the position of priesthoods in the civic cursus honorum, bene- factions and festivals, the association of Aphrodite with other divinities and divine personifications, references to Aphrodite in documents concerning the history of the re- lations between Aphrodisias and Rome, and personal names inspired by Aphrodite and her myths). The prominent posi- tion of Aphrodite in the civic ideology of "her city" should be seen in the context of the latent rivalries between Aphro- disias and her neighbors, as a study of similar phenomena in other Carian cities may show. The close association of these civic communities with a single local divinity and the ostentatious commemoration of traditions related to their patron deity enabled them to strengthen their iden- tity and to accentuate their individuality in an era of cosmopolitanism. SESSION IIIA: COLLOQUIUM: WATER USE IN THE ANCIENT CITY GEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN ANCIENT WATER SUP- PLY: SYRACUSE AND AGRIGENTO: Dora P Crouch, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute The cities of Syracuse and Agrigento are similar, being founded in Archaic times and located at coastal sites that began with trade posts (emporia) and grew by the fifth cen- tury B.C. into very extensive cities. Yet in some crucial ways they are different, and those differences relate very strongly to the geology of the two sites. Both locations have karst shafts and channels, but the kind of rock has made im- portant differences in longevity of the channel systems and their suitability as long-distance water lines. Both occupy saucer-shaped terrain, but that of Agrigento is much more steeply tilted. The stone at Syracuse is two kinds of limestone, the upper one being relatively soluble. This has meant that karst channels have cut through the limestone, in some cases along fault lines, creating the openings that became Classical Greek aqueducts and Early Christian catacombs. In Agrigento similar passages were first cut by water dis- solving stone and later by humans enlarging the openings. The water channels known from the work of Schubring (1860s) and Arnone (1940s) are aligned with the geological discontinuities of the site, indicating that the human build- ers utilized natural features when building the waterl/ drainage system. The stone at Agrigento, however, is weak calcarenite. Therefore, the site is more susceptible to earth- quake and landslide damage. IMPERIAL WATER PIPES IN ROMAN CITIES: Christer Bruun, University of Toronto Frontinus writes that about 17% of the water that reached Rome was distributed sub nomine Caesaris (Aq. 78), the rest being delivered to a small number of privileged private users and for the public at large (usibus publicis). Frontinus's information can be verified from numerous stamps on Roman lead water pipes (fistulae), which men- tion Roman emperors. The amount of water that was re- served for the emperor and the court seems disproportion- ally large. Or was it? What was meant by the phrase sub nomine Caesaris? Was this portion intended wholly for the personal use of the emperor and the court, or was water distributed "under the emperor's name" to other destina- tions as well? Archaeological evidence proves that the lat- ter could be the case; the large public Baths of Trajan, e.g., were undoubtedly supplied by water pipes bearing the name of the emperor Trajan. This paper investigates whether one can establish a pub- lic destination for other imperial water pipes in Rome and elsewhere. I have collected, with some omissions, the in- scriptional evidence from lead pipes for Rome and the rest of the empire (Ostia, Lugdunum, Syracuse, etc.) and argued that also the Castra Praetoria received water sub nomine Caesaris. Many other stamps still need to be analyzed in regard to content and archaeological context. This in- vestigation also concerns general questions of imperial pol- icy: upon what social groups and purposes did the em- peror in Rome put a high value; in which cities is there an imperial involvement in the distribution of water? WATER USE IN PRIVATE BATHS AT POMPEII: Nathalie de Haan, Catholic University, Nijmegen Ancient Pompeii contains at least 28 houses with a pri- vate bath suite, a number which is far higher than previ- ously known. This paper explores the use of water in these private baths. First, I focus on a set of "practical questions" and the archaeological evidence for solutions: how did the house owners provide their baths with water? How did they get rid of the waste water? How was water heated for the bathing tub in the caldarium? The demand for water depended on the size of the pri- vate baths and on the facilities offered. I can now distin- guish three groups of private baths based on their need for water. Furthermore, there is a direct link between the building of the so-called Serino aqueduct in Campania in the Augustan period, which presumably also branched off to Pompeii, and the increase in construction of private baths in the last decades of the first century B.C. Only from this period on did the more lavish private bath suites come into use, with a corresponding greater demand for water. For such baths, which are sometimes equipped with an open air piscina, tap water was a conditio sine qua non. Fi- nally, consideration of the private baths in Pompeii con- tributes significantly to the ongoing debate about the ex-</page><page sequence="26">356 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 tent to which facilities in the city still functioned in the post-earthquake period (A.D. 62-79) and about how water management was handled in general in the last years before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. WATER PIPE SYSTEMS IN THE HOUSES OF POMPEII: DISTRIBUTION AND USE: Gemma C.M.Jansen, Cath- olic University, Nijmegen Although Roman aqueducts have been researched for many years and recently the distribution of the main water lines has been investigated in various ancient cities, no attention has been paid to the layout, distribution, and function of the water pipe system inside private houses and to the question of what water was used for inside these houses. Pompeii, with its well-excavated houses, offers good opportunities for such an exploration. During the last few years these unstudied aspects of the water supply system at Pompeii have been the focus of re- searchers from the University of Nijmegen and engineers from the Technical University of Delft. Because only a few lead pipes have remained in situ, together with 30 bronze taps and 15 lead distribution boxes, it was difficult to ob- tain a clear picture of the whole system. However, on the basis of small indications (e.g., indentations in the tufo impluvia) and with the help of metal detectors, we have arrived at a reconstruction. This paper presents the separate elements of the internal network and places them in the context of the pipe system in the house as a whole. I also discuss how the pipe system operated. The reconstruction reveals to what parts of the house the water was directed and for what it was used: to supply the fountains, as drinking water, and for do- mestic uses. URBAN WATER STORAGE, DISTRIBUTION, AND USAGE IN ROMAN NORTH AFRICA: Andrew Wilson, Insti- tute of Archaeology, Oxford University Models of Roman urban water distribution are usually based on the well-preserved evidence for urban water sup- ply from Pompeii and the literary evidence of Frontinus for Rome, and Roman aqueducts are generally assumed to have worked on the principle of constant offtake. Data from North Africa, however, suggest different arrangements for urban water supply networks in this region of unpre- dictable rainfall. Examination of large aqueduct-fed cistern complexes in North Africa reveals a range of functions- as settling tanks, regulating reservoirs, and as storage chambers to which people might resort to draw water through open- ings in their vaults. Abundant evidence for sluices and stop- cocks suggests the creation of reserves to balance supply against demand and to cope with drought. Water distribution networks frequently lack intermediate pressure towers, and at some sites (Volubilis and Timgad) users drew water directly from the main conduit without a distribution castellum. Evidence from Volubilis and Dje- mila suggests the use of stopcocks to switch supply on or off at the point where it enters a house. Different qualities of water were rationally used for ap- propriate purposes, with poorer quality water used for industrial processes or watering gardens, and better water reserved for drinking. Combined use of wells, cisterns, springs, and aqueducts with reservoir complexes suggests a multifaceted approach to the risk of drought. SESSION IIIB: ROMAN ARCHITECTURE: SYM- BOLISM AND CONTROVERSY EXCAVATIONS IN THE AREA OF SACRA VESTA: FINAL REPORT: R.T Scott, Bryn Mawr College A final month of excavation was carried out this past summer in the north wing of the Trajanic Domus Virginum Vestalium to confirm the long (seventh century B.C.-17th century) chronological sequence that has now been estab- lished in the area and to improve our knowledge of a prin- cipal east-west artery of presumed Late Archaic date that traversed the lower slope of the Palatine and terminated at either end in approaches leading up to the summit of the hill. We had been tracing it, as circumstances allowed, from west to east since 1988; and in 1995 the eastern ap- proach was uncovered by University of Rome excavators working under the supervision of Paolo Carafa in an area not far from the place where we had located but not ex- plored a portion of the street in 1993. Checking of the chronological sequence was more suc- cessful than the search for additional, more substantial remains of the street, which investigation revealed to have been removed or rendered inaccessible by the deep Im- perial foundations. Survey by total station, however, con- firmed its projected course east to the junction with the uphill ramp. Its course overall suggests that on the east it should be associated in part with houses being reexam- ined by the University of Rome, while on the west it ap- pears to have marked the southern limit of the sanctuary and sacred grove of Vesta. TEMPLUM PACIS: THE SURVIVING ARCHITECTURE RECONSIDERED: James Packer, Northwestern University Two fundamental articles publish the excavated antiq- uities of the Forum of Peace in Rome: BullCom 65 (1937) 7-40; BullCom 86 (1956-1958) 119-42. Only a limited num- ber of other relevant materials survive in the city archives of Rome - although measurements on the original draw- ings render legible the occasionally indecipherable repro- ductions of the published versions. Examination of these figures and the other existing evidence thus suggests an explication and revision of the famous ColinilGismondi reconstruction of the complex. The high stone fire wall around the Templum Pacis re- sembled that of Augustus's Forum. The east and west Co- rinthian colonnades had red granite shafts, high attics, flat roofs, and aedicula. Behind each were two rectangular recesses (the northeast one built into the medieval Tor de'Conti). The unfluted Africano columns en ressaut on the north side of the Forum were probably the prototypes for the neighboring "Colonnacce" in the Forum Transitorium.</page><page sequence="27">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 357 The five halls at the south end of the Forum stood on a podium higher than those of the east and west colon- nades. With a shallow rear niche, the middle one was ded- icated to Peace. It was a quarter longer and wider (and prob- ably correspondingly higher) than the adjacent rooms. The Forma Urbis was mounted on the west wall of the room to the west. Extensively remodeled by Septimius Severus and later transformed into the Church of SS. Cosma and Damiano, the adjoining room projected a short distance beyond the fire wall. A shallow apse originally terminated its wider west half. THE COLOSSEUM IN ROME: DATING THE VAULTS OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURE: Lynne C. Lancaster, Oxford University The uppermost parts of the Colosseum have long been recognized as belonging to post-Flavian restorations of the building. One of the few scholars to discuss in detail the evidence for the ancient restorations of the superstructure was A. von Gerkan in an article published over 70 years ago (RM 40 [1925] 11-50). He proposed that in the north- west quadrant and part of the northeast quadrant, much of the third level was reconstructed, probably after the fire of A.D. 217. The results of my study of the concrete vault- ing, while supporting his findings, also indicate that the reconstructions in these quadrants actually reach much farther down into the fabric of the building than he pro- posed. Changes in materials and workmanship suggest that the vaulting of the two ambulatories at the first (ground) and second levels was reconstructed from bay 34 to bay 60, a section that includes about two-thirds of the extant parts of the outer ambulatories. In addition, anepigraphic brick stamps on the brick formwork of some of the vaults of the first level indicate a terminus post quem for these vaults of the Hadrianic period. The redating of the vaults in the two lowest levels of the building has consequences for the study of Roman construction since they contain what have been assumed to be the earliest examples of brick lattice ribbing and brick formwork. In fact, it is now clear that neither of these construction techniques was used in Rome until the second century A.D. A FORUM DIOCLETIANI? DIOCLETIAN'S PROGRAM- MATIC RESTORATION OF THE FORUM'S CENTRAL AREA: Michael Thomas, University of Texas at Austin In this paper I examine both the phenomenological effect and architectural tradition of Diocletian's restora- tions of the Roman Forum's central area. After the fire of Carinus, Diocletian restored both basilicas, the Curia, and the Forum of Caesar. Despite the extensive effort to restore the buildings of the Forum to their original state, Dio- cletian's most innovative restorations were those of the cen- tral area of the Forum. Here, he built a new Rostra at the central area's eastern end and, at the western end, he re- built the old one, where he erected the five-column mon- ument in honor of the Decennalia of the Tetrarchs. Recent reevaluation of the archaeological evidence by Giuliani and Verduchi reveals that Diocletian's building program also included a line of columns on his new Rostra, a line of seven honorary columns in front of the Basilica Julia, and in front of the west Rostra, a large single-column mon- ument on top of a pyramidal base, which we know today as the Column of Phocas. Scholarship has generally neglected Diocletian's resto- rations in the Forum's central area, focusing primarily on the five-column Decennalia Monument. Instead, these res- torations should be considered as a multicolumned mon- ument that ringed the Forum's central area. I argue that Diocletian not only recalled the architectural and icono- graphical tradition of the Imperial fora, but he may have relied on conventions of commemorative architecture to create a highly visible monument to himself and his Tetrarchy. SOME NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE BUILDING PROGRAM OF HEROD THE GREAT: Duane W Roller, Ohio State University The building program of Herod the Great is well known. Yet most analyses have tended to ignore the bulk of the program, which stretched from western Greece to the inte- rior of Syria and the Levant. Herod's buildings were an important element of the Augustan policy of Romanizing the East: significantly, it was Herod who built Augustus's victory city of Nikopolis after Actium. Herod's inspiration came not from Hellenistic sources, but from the dynamism of contemporary Rome, since the traditions he saw in his youth were Roman, and as a Roman citizen he was more attuned to the rising fortunes of Rome than those of the decaying Hellenistic world. A crucial source of inspiration was his visit to Rome in 40 B.C. when the city was in the midst of a vibrant archi- tectural renewal, an extensive education for Herod in the latest architectural trends. Examples abound of indigenous Italian architectural elements unknown outside Italy un- til Herod saw them and used them in his program, par- ticularly the Roman theater, basilica, amphitheater, villa, and portico. Herod was anxious to be as Roman as possible. In im- itating the most innovative trends of Roman architecture, he demonstrated his suitability to be the Roman represen- tative in the East. This political use of architecture became an element of Augustan policy. It is significant that Herod built buildings in every important center of the Greek world, often, as at Nikopolis and Berytos, providing the architec- tural implementation of Roman political policy. Thus the Herodian program was a mechanism by which the revo- lutionary architectural forms of the Augustan world- and by implication the Augustan revolution itself- spread through the Greek and Levantine world. THE DATE OF THE MAISON CARRIE AT NiMES:James C. Anderson, jr., University of Georgia The Maison Carr&amp;e is dated to the reign of Augustus by reference to its dimensions, architectural decoration,</page><page sequence="28">358 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 and inscriptions. The two inscriptions once there, however, provide no evidence. No texts remain; only clamp holes without countersunk letter patterns attest to what letter belonged where. The patterns are not consistent with the texts restored in them, which ought to be discarded. The dating of the temple, like that of the arch at Orange, can- not be based on phantom inscriptions. The basic unit of the building's plan is the Trajanic pes Drusianus, which is unattested earlier. Use of this module in the design of the temple suggests a date at least a century after Augustus. Similar problems arise in the architectural decoration of the temple, e.g., motifs used in the lintels and doorposts became common only after the mid-first century A.D., while the dimensions of capitals, architrave, frieze, and cornice do not correspond to those of any building securely dated to Augustan or Early Imperial times. A date in or after the second century A.D. may be more consistent with the physical evidence. HEARTH AND HOME: DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND IN- DUSTRY IN THE ROMAN HOUSE:Joanne Berry, Read- ing University The array of domestic artifacts from household contexts at Pompeii is a uniquely valuable source about Roman do- mestic life, and has the potential to force a rethinking of many of the assumptions commonly made about the Ro- man house. In particular, this information can shed light on the practical organization of the house and on the so- cial processes that influenced this organization. My aim in this paper is to illustrate the value of the Pompeian ma- terial by focusing on just one of the elements that could have a role to play in the Roman house, that of industry- production and commerce. While many assumptions about the relationship between the Roman house and trade and industry have been recently destroyed, and it has been recognized that even large houses had a direct connection with the shops along their facade, most production activ- ity remains largely invisible in the surviving architectural record of Pompeian houses. The artifacts, however, pro- vide an important way of establishing the extent of this kind of activity within a house, since any medium-scale operation implies a certain level of investment in equip- ment. Thus the extent and range of tools should reveal the importance of this type of activity in each house. I therefore examine the evidence for both normal, every- day domestic work and for larger-scale activity in a sample of three insulae at Pompeii (Reg. I, Ins. 7-9) consisting of houses, shops, and a number of industrial "plants" such as fulleries. This analysis establishes the point at which domestic work becomes industrial production and how often this occurs: most of the studied units have tools of some description, but where specialized activities take place there are specific groupings of tools. The result of this analy- sis is then used to discuss whether or not household in- dustries are reliant on essential architectural features, whether they occur in certain types or sizes of house, how this type of activity relates to other activities in the house, and whether this organization of household activity reveals anything about its status in Roman society. SESSION IIIC: VASE PAINTING AND ICO- NOGRAPHY BUBBLES = BAUBLES, BANGLES, AND BEADS: ADDED CLAY IN ATHENIAN VASE PAINTING AND ITS SIG- NIFICANCE: Beth Cohen, New York Society J.D. Beazley described the "raised black dots" of Helen's hair on Makron's red-figure skyphos in Boston (ARV2 458.1) as "bubbles" (CB 3.35). The raised black dots, com- mon on Late Archaic vases for hair, beards, and grapes, have also been described as globules of extruded black glaze. Microscopic inspection of fragmentary vases by Eu- phronios helps document the true technology: the dots consist of added clay that is subsequently glazed black. Significantly, an early instance of added clay for originally gilt details occurs alongside raised black dots (as hair) on a cup by Euphronios from the Athenian Acropolis (ARV2 17.18). Thus, gilded and black three-dimensional elements on Athenian vases share the same basic technology. Dur- ing the fifth century B.C., while raised black hair passes from fashion, details in gilt relief increase. Although shiny added-clay relief on Classical pottery appears to recall metal vases, another analogy may be more apt. In Renaissance painting, as spatial illusionism increased, a medieval prac- tice, preferred by many patrons, persisted: gold leaf applied to gesso relief for brocades, jewelry, armor, weapons, etc. Lost Greek painting, often evoked through Italian paint- ing, is normally perceived as a pure medium, with spatial figural compositions injudiciously applied colors on pre- pared flat wooden surfaces. Perhaps our mind's eye should also envision Classical paintings with raised, gilded bau- bles, bangles, and beads satisfying popular taste. THE VASE AS VENTRILOQUIST: KALOS INSCRIPTIONS AND THE CULTURE OF DISPLAY: Niall W Slater, Emory University Kalos inscriptions on vases, while long used for chrono- logical or prosopographical studies, represent a cultural practice too little understood. Most assume they are pri- marily acts of communication (declarations of affection), although opinions vary as to whether the authors of these communications are the vases' creators or purchasers. In- sufficient attention has been paid to the audience for, and reception of, these messages beyond the individual praised. Since many kalos inscriptions appear on symposiastic ves- sels, it has been tempting to see them as part of a discourse of seduction within the symposium. Yet kalos inscriptions on Panathenaics and other dedications project their mes- sage to a wider audience, as do kalos graffiti noted in Aris- tophanes' Wasps and the archaeological record. Kalos in- scriptions place named individuals on public display and invite audience participation in a larger economy of the creation and circulation of fame. Given Svenbrds insight that an early Greek inscription "is a machine for producing sound," we must ask what kind of performance a kalos inscription demands. While not obviously assimilable to the other major categories of vase</page><page sequence="29">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 359 inscriptions (signatures, labels, representations of song or speech), they come closest to reflecting discourse at the symposium or on a wider public stage. Moreover, they not only represent but help create contemporary discourse, by putting symbols before the eyes of symposiasts who read them out loud and discuss them,just as they do other vase inscriptions and subjects. Kalos inscriptions therefore raise fundamental questions about authorship and even the or- chestration of the culture of fame. REPETITION IN ATTIC BLACK-FIGURE AND THE DEVEL- OPMENT OF VISUAL NARRATIVE: Ann Steiner, Frank- lin and Marshall College Repetition is a crucial element in written and visual nar- rative; at a minimum, characters must reappear to turn an event or statement into narrative. This paper reveals the syntactical principle of repetition as an essential com- ponent of the earliest Athenian black-figure vase painting. Further, it demonstrates how Athenian painters' exploita- tion of repetition is directly linked to sophisticated devel- opments in expressing narrative subjects, evident by the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. The earliest Athenian black-figure vases repeat subjects in two or more fields, as examination of some works of the Lion and Bellerophon Painters demonstrates. Slightly later, this type of repetition is fundamental to the identity of such classes as Horsehead amphoras and Komast cups. In fact, it is such repetition that makes Attic Komast cups distinct from their close Corinthian counterparts and antecedents. Once they establish such repetition as a syntactical "habit," painters exploit it in various ways. Repeated figures link scenes in different fields, creating the foundation for narratives that extend beyond a single field. The C-Painter is an individual whose work reveals the transition from Komast-cup-type repetition to that where stages or com- plementary elements of narratives are communicated through repetition among fields. The Heidelberg Painter develops other idiosyncratic uses of repetition to tell stories. This paper concludes that to understand the uniqueness and subtlety of sixth-century Athenian narrative, we must go beyond consideration of subject matter and imagery to include the syntactical feature of repetition. SETTING AND NARRATION IN ATHENIAN VASE PAINT- ING: THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS AS A CASE STUDY: Guy Hedreen, Williams College In Art and Illusion, Ernst Gombrich suggested that the most profound impetus for the development of a natural- istic or lifelike style of art in Greece was the desire to rep- resent narratives. His hypothesis is especially attractive to- day, because recent cultural studies have emphasized that narration was a significant form of discourse in Archaic and Classical Greece, not just an unessential form of en- tertainment. Extending Gombrich's hypothesis, I argue that setting, one element of the naturalistic style, served a vari- ety of important narrative functions in Archaic and Early Classical vase painting. I argue, in particular, that elements of setting do not, as often thought, have to play direct, utilitarian roles in the action in visual narratives (e.g., the tree in represen- tations of the story of Sinis) in order to contribute to the effectiveness of the narrative. Setting often refers to a mo- ment or an action in a story other than the one represented, and provides information about the antecedents or the consequences of the action depicted. In this respect, set- ting operates in the way that Nikolaus Himmelmann- Wildschiitz (Erzdhlung und Figur) thought personal attri- butes worked. In visual narratives, setting can play two roles simultaneously, facilitating analepsis (or prolepsis) while serving as a seemingly inconsequential "reality effect." I illustrate my argument with an examination of the Judg- ment of Paris in Athenian vase painting. I argue that the development of a pastoral setting provides information about Paris's background, which in turn explains why he chose Aphrodite rather than Hera or Athena. THE CHARIOT RACERS ON THE FRAN?(OIS VASE: Steven Lattimore, University of California, Los Angeles The chariot race on the Frangois Vase is linked to the games for Patroklos in Iliad 23 by the emphatic position of Achilles as umpire as well as by the number of racers, yet of the five named by Homer only Diomedes is on the vase. The usual explanation for the discrepancy is that Kleitias forgot Homer's names and was content with sub- stitutions; other suggestions are that Kleitias was follow- ing another poem or tradition or that he used poetic li- cense to develop his own version. I agree with S. Lowenstam (TAPA 122 [1992] 176-77) that the last possibility is the most likely, although I disagree with his specific interpretation of the scene. In the Homeric account, the chariot race re- ceived by far the most extended treatment; analogously (and, apparently, in contrast to Sophilos a few years before him), Kleitias used the race to represent the entire games, in which there were two overall winners: Diomedes and Odysseus. Kleitias accordingly inserted Odysseus into Homer's race; moreover, he placed him first as the even- tual "best of the Achaians." The equally intrusive second- place finish of Automedon, ahead of Diomedes, shows further awareness of the Iliad and also contributes to Kleitias's thematic treatment of Achilles. The charioteer of Patroklos, who replaced the slain Patroklos as Achilles' charioteer, was uniquely close to the two heroes who would share the same coffin; Automedon played a notable role in the battle over Patroklos's body and assuaged his own grief by doing so. THE ARCHAIC SATYR IN THE GREEK WORLD: NOTH- ING TO DO WITH DIONYSOS? Ann-Marie Knoblauch, Bryn Mawr College The satyr is ubiquitous on Attic vases of the Archaic period, appearing more commonly than any other figure. The context often associates the beast with Dionysos and</page><page sequence="30">360 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 he appears as a lusty rogue, an attendant or drunken com- panion to the Greek god of wine. This characterization often extends beyond Attica and is used to define satyrs in other media found elsewhere. This Attic definition, how- ever, does not apply to all areas of the Greek world, and the satyr appears as an independent and important reli- gious entity in the Archaic period. Especially lacking out- side of Attica is evidence connecting the satyr with Dionysos. Coins (none of which are Attic in origin) are intended for wide audiences and form the basis for this argument. Satyrs are shown alone or paired with other deities, but never with Dionysos. (The coins of Naxos on Sicily are an exception.) The satyr predates Dionysos in these regions. This is especially conspicuous in northern Greece (Thasos, Lete) and in the East (Kyzikos, Phokaia, Mytilene), where satyrs appear as early as 100 years before Dionysos. Outside Attica the satyr is popular in wine-producing regions and is shown with grapes and wine vessels. Because of his early and independent prominence, the satyr-not Dionysos- was given credit for the introduction (and con- tinuation) of local wine production. It was this preexisting association of the satyr with wine that attracted Dionysos to the creature, who then became an important part of the god's Attic cult. ZEUXIS, VASE PAINTING, AND THE FEMALE NUDE: Robert E Sutton, Jr., Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis Recent discussions of nudity in Greek art have neglected the famous painting of Helen by Zeuxis of Herakleia. Con- sideration of the textual evidence together with contem- porary vase painting suggests that this lost masterpiece was innovative both in creating a new formal type, the kneel- ing bather, and in establishing a new conceptual type, the respectable female nude. Zeuxis himself may have originated the story that he painted Helen as the artistic expression of beauty by com- bining the best parts of five parthenoi. Drawing on pure models to express the highest artistic ideal, the artist created an image that transcended all notion of shame in reveal- ing the female body. Though commissioned by Kroton, a version of the Helen was displayed in Athens where Zeuxis was active during the 420s B.C. This painting in Athens is the most likely inspiration for the transformation, described earlier (AJA 95 [1991] 318), of the nude female bather on Attic pottery ca. 425 B.C. Its influence can explain the simultaneous introduc- tion of the kneeling bather type and its innovative and consistent use in nuptial and idyllic context primarily on vase shapes intended for feminine use. Over the next cen- tury this figural type, in various settings and adaptations, occurs on 20 Attic vases, at least one Italiote vase, numer- ous gems, mirrors, and figurines, and is later adapted to monumental sculpture. Direct connection to Zeuxis's paint- ing is provided by a vase inscription recently read by Rob- ert Guy that identifies one of the bathers as Helen. THEATRICAL COSTUME? DIONYSOS IN THE HOUSE OF THE MASKS AT DELOS: Zografia Welch, McMaster University From the Classical period to Late Antiquity, depictions of Dionysos riding on the back of a feline are fairly con- sistent and adhere to basic iconographic elements. The mosaic emblema from the House of the Masks at Delos, how- ever, displays a number of unusual features, centering pri- marily around Dionysos's costume. Earlier scholarly dis- cussions of the mosaic place it in the world of the theater on the basis of Dionysos's costume, for which they strive to establish a theatrical connection. One theory (J. Cha- monard, Dilos XIV [Paris 1933] 14, 20-21) claims the cos- ume to be that of a tragic actor, of the kind worn by gods, heroes, and heroines in representations of tragedy on fifth- and fourth-century B.C. vases, a theatrical costume that may have passed down to the late second century B.C. Another theory (E Matz, Ein r6misches Meisterwerk [Berlin 1958] 24) describes it as a garment required for the de- piction of kings in the theater and assimilates it to Hel- lenistic royal dress. In this paper I investigate the likelihood that a distinc- tive tragic actor's costume or Hellenistic royal dress was depicted and conclude that the existing theories are not substantiated by iconographic evidence. Although Di- onysos's costume in the mosaic of Delos is unique, I argue that it may reflect an early stage in the iconography of Dionysos's Indian Triumph and I compare it with later ex- amples where he appears in the same costume. ON THE RELATION OF POTTERY AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGE: LATE HELLENISTIC ATHENS: Natalia Vo- geikof, American School of Classical Studies at Athens This paper is concerned with the significance of pot- tery as an indicator of socioeconomic change. In recent years, a number of scholars have argued that pottery itself is insensitive to cultural change, while others have coun- tered that pottery does indeed reflect social events. Neither view is supported here as a general principle. Instead, this paper argues that the relationship between material culture - pottery in our case - and society depends on hu- man agency and is best understood as a dialectic between archaeological and historical evidence. The study of the ceramic evidence from Late Hellenis- tic Athens reveals important changes in the material record. On the one hand, Attic workshops show renewed interest in the decoration of fine pottery. On the other hand, there is a noticeable increase in the number of imports and lo- cal imitations of non-Attic pottery. How is this evidence to be understood? An evaluation of the culture-historical context for this period provides a number of socioeconomic changes that help us interpret the archaeological record. In 166 B.C. the declaration of Delos as a free port under Athenian</page><page sequence="31">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 361 control resulted in the emergence of a prosperous group of Athenians interested in long-distance commerce. Inscrip- tions from the late second century B.C. also attest demo- graphic changes in Athens, suggesting a great influx of foreigners. Athens now emerges a prosperous and cosmo- politan city, and part of this growth is reflected in the ceramic record. SESSION IIID: ANATOLIA IN THE FIRST MIL- LENNIUM B.C. THE WOODEN FURNITURE AND HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS FROM GORDION, TURKEY: RESULTS OF 15 SEASONS' WORK: Elizabeth Simpson, Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts In 1995, the project to study, conserve, and exhibit the remarkable collection of wooden artifacts excavated at the site of Gordion, Turkey, carried out its 15th season, com- pleting the conservation of all the Gordion wood sched. uled to undergo treatment. More than 40 conservators, ar- chaeologists, wood scientists, and cabinetmakers have contributed toward the successful completion of this work. More than 68 wooden artifacts have been treated, includ- ing the large collection of fine wooden furniture from three royal Phrygian tombs at Gordion- tumuli MM, P, and W, excavated by the University Museum in 1957, 1956, and 1959, respectively. Four important pieces from the collec- tion have been mounted on Plexiglas for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara. Publications have detailed the study of the objects, conservation pro- cesses utilized, and wood species and wood pathology anal- yses carried out. Once poorly understood, the furniture from Gordion has now been thoroughly studied; as a re- sult of the project's work, this furniture has come to be recognized as the most important collection of well- preserved ancient Near Eastern wooden furniture ever found, rivaled only in Egypt by the furniture from the tomb of Tutankhamen. TEXTILE PRODUCTION AT GORDION AND THE PHRY- GIAN ECONOMY: Richard Brendan Burke, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles Suddenly destroyed around 700 B.C., the Early Phrygian capital at Gordion provides an almost ideal opportunity to study the organization of large-scale craft production at a regional center. Excavations at Gordion show that the Phrygians excelled in ivory carving, metalworking, and textile production, among other crafts. Since textile man- ufacture is labor-intensive and involves many different stages of production, craft specialization results in a bet- ter product for both redistribution and exchange. These aspects make textile production particularly suited to cen- tralized, palatial control. By examining the organization of this significant industry at a center such as Gordion, we can characterize modes of craft production that will help explain the wealth of a ruler such as Midas and his Phrygian kingdom. A detailed study of the tools associated with spinning and weaving found in the Terrace buildings, the Central Court rooms, and the Megara at Gordion indicate that tex- tile production was a major industrial activity controlled by the ruling Phrygian elite. Also found with these tools were food-processing equipment and objects of precious materials, such as ivory, bronze, gold, and silver. The dis- tribution within the citadel mound of craft indicators pro- vides information about the highly reputed but little-known Phrygian economy. Changes in the control of productiv- ity, or at least new influences, can be seen by comparing the results of this study to later periods in the history of Gordion. GORDION: THE IMPORTED TRANSPORT AMPHORAS, 600-400 B.C.: Mark L. Lawall, University of Manitoba Large quantities of Aegean pottery appear at Gordion, permitting exploration of theories about Aegean-Anatolian trade. The transport amphoras from the site contribute new evidence to debates concerning this trade. Finds at Gordion include amphoras from northeastern Greece, Lesbos, Chios, and the region surrounding Samos and Miletos. Imports at Gordion reveal changing intensi- ties of trade with these regions. The large numbers of par- ticular amphora types, such as Chian and Mendean, are expectable on the basis of finds elsewhere. The significant presence of imports from Lesbos and further south, near Samos, however, raises issues of preferred trade routes and the effects of politics on trade. Amphoras may have reached Gordion by various routes: overland, either from the central coast of Asia Minor or from the area of Daskyleion, near Kyzikos; or along water routes, such as the Sangarios River. Gordion's imports came either directly from coastal Asia Minor or indirectly from trade between the Aegean and the Black Sea. Preliminary studies of patterns of imports in the Black Sea area, with similarly greater numbers of Samian and Lesbian am- phoras, suggest the latter scenario. The Royal Road pro- vides a possible overland route. These amphoras illustrate the importance of the Per- sian empire as a consumer of Aegean products. They also turn debate based on texts and Ionian fine wares in favor of the economic strength of Asia Minor and nearby islands before and after the Ionian Revolt. AMPHORA AND LAGYNOS STAMPS FROM HELLENISTIC TROY: Christine Panas, University of Cincinnati Recent excavations at Troy have yielded over 125 stamped amphora handles. Many of these are from Thasos or Rhodes and date to the late fourth-mid-first century B.C. The ma-</page><page sequence="32">362 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 jority of these stamps have been noted at other sites, but in contrast to these sites, where only imported stamps have been noted, at Troy we find two groups of stamped han- dles that are clearly of local manufacture. The first group dates to the fourth century B.C. and bears the name "Al- kanor" in the Aeolic dialect. This dialect also has been noted in some graffiti. The second group, mostly monograms, dates to the late third-mid-second century B.C. These han- dles are associated with banded amphoras that have grooved rims. Parallels for these banded amphoras are rare at this late date, suggesting a conservative style at this local work- shop. Other amphora stamps come from Alexandria Troas, Sinope, Thrace, Macedonia, Knidos, and Paros. Together these stamps form a fairly consistent group reflecting the Aegean trading patterns of the period. The local stamps form an unusually high percentage of the total, however, indicating the importance of local contributions to trade in the region. CERAMICS AND CULTURE: THE ARCHAIC FINE WARES OF TROY: Susan McMullen Fisher, University of Cincinnati Recent excavations at Troy have recovered for the first time well-stratified Archaic architecture, ceramics, and small finds. Of particular interest are the Archaic fine wares, which attest to the city's growth during this period and most clearly reflect Troy's position at the crossroads between East and West. Troy's new corpus of Archaic fine wares was recovered from both domestic and sanctuary contexts and spans the period from the early seventh to the early fifth century B.C. Wares include a large variety of imports from the Greek mainland, primarily Corinth and Athens, the Ionian coast, the East Greek islands, and the northeastern Aegean. On the other hand, the gray and tan wares, western Asia Minor imitations, and a specifically Trojan red-glazed ware sug- gest local ceramic manufacture. In addition to these com- mon ceramics are more unusual pieces such as a minia- ture stand and clay votive shield. Both at the site itself and in the broader context of the ancient world, Troy's Archaic fine ware has far-reaching implications. Archaeologically, this material fills in cru- cial gaps in the ceramic sequence, and allows us to exam- ine new and previously known wares in greater quantities and with more secure contexts than before. Culturally, this corpus reflects the blending of Hellenic influences and those of the Black Sea region with local Trojan traditions, many of which have their roots in the Bronze Age. The resulting picture is a multidimensional Archaic Troy rather than the standard, more narrow view of a solely Aeolic Greek settlement. THE SECRET RITES OF LESBOS: A FAUNAL RECON- STRUCTION: Deborah Ruscillo, University College London Canadian excavations on the acropolis of Mytilene have revealed the remains of a sanctuary devoted to Demeter dating from the Late Classical/Early Hellenistic period. Much of the architecture of the sanctuary was destroyed during the Roman invasion of Mytilene in the first century A.D., and during the subsequent occupation and building construction over the site during the Byzantine and Turk- ish periods. Over 5,000 bones were retrieved from the Classical and Hellenistic levels in the excavation area. The analysis of the faunal remains from these strata has aided archaeolo- gists in reconstructing the structure and function of the Demeter sanctuary of Mytilene. A row of five altars was excavated to the east of the site to facilitate sacrifice to chthonic and Olympian deities. Bones retrieved from this area reveal the sacrifice of mainly young sheep, goats, and pigs. A stone-lined sacrificial pit also excavated in this area contained only the remains of juvenile pigs, suggesting the observation of the festival of Thesmophoria. This fea- ture reinforced the identification of the site as a Demeter sanctuary, and reveals information concerning the Thesmo- phoria in Mytilene. Test trenches excavated to determine the western extent of the sanctuary revealed a concentra- tion of bones characteristic of the sanctuary dump. Other interesting faunal remains from the site include worked bone pieces, worn astragaloi, or knucklebones, and a single claw of a brown bear, possibly worn and/or offered as an ornament or talisman. The discovery of these items gives insight into the types of votive offerings accepted in the worship of Demeter. MULTICULTURALISM IN MICROCOSM: THE EVIDENCE OF THE TERRACOTTA FIGURINES FROM THE HELLE- NISTIC SANCTUARY OF DEMETER THESMOPHOROS AT MYTILENE: Kathleen Donahue Sherwood, Mon- treal Society Excavations conducted by a team of Canadian scholars between 1986 and 1990 on the ancient acropolis of My- tilene on Lesbos unearthed a modest sanctuary of Deme- ter Thesmophoros. Worship at the site flourished from the fourth to second century B.C., and continued at a re- duced level into the first century B.C. Numerous terracotta figurines found in association with the remains of struc- tures tentatively identified as dining rooms or oikoi to the west, and a row of altars to the east, constitute the bulk of offerings dedicated in the sanctuary during the perfor- mance of religious rituals there. Representations of dei- ties and other types of figurines reflect Greek contacts with the wider world from the fourth century onward, and under- line Mytilene's position as a port city on the trade routes linking lands to the south, such as Egypt, with the straits of the Dardanelles and the lands beyond, and also as a crossroad between mainland Greece and Asia Minor. In this paper I present the types of terracotta figurines portraying deities discovered at the site, ranging in date from the late sixth century to the late first century B.C. Figures of Aphrodite, Artemis, and Eros attest to the pres- ence of the traditional Greek deities. In addition, repre- sentations of Isis or her votaries, Harpocrates, and "Baubo" indicate connections with Egypt, while figurines of Kybele, who was particularly popular, and Attis testify to ties with</page><page sequence="33">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 363 Asia Minor. I conclude with an examination of the partic- ular evidence provided by the presence of "foreign" dei- ties in Demeter's sanctuary on the acropolis, and how that microcosm may reflect the evolution of religious thought and the increasingly multicultural nature of society in the ever-expanding and cosmopolitan world of Hellenistic Greece. FROM THE LATE IRON AGE TO THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD AT KINET HOYUJK (CLASSICAL ISSOS), A CI- LICIAN COASTAL TOWN: Charles Gates, Bilkent University Excavations conducted at Kinet Hoyiik (near Dortyol, Hatay province, Turkey) since 1992 by Bilkent University have revealed a port town occupied continuously from at least the Early Bronze Age through the Hellenistic period, at which point its two harbors evidently silted in. The site was reoccupied only briefly in the 13th century A.D. The final centuries of ancient habitation, fourth-first centuries B.C., span a period of important political and economic transition in the larger region of Cilicia and the trans- Amanus Amuq plain, from the final decades of Achae- menid Persian rule to the founding and florescence of Seleucid Antioch, and consequently deserve attention. In addition, the current excavations are the first in the area to document this period since the Tarsus project of 50 years ago. The town, identified as classical Issos, underwent a ma- jor building campaign in ca. 400-350 B.C., with a new city wall complete with towers and a glacis descending the slopes of the mound, by then of considerable height. These im- provements reflect its importance for the Persian empire as a regional center on the northern Levantine coast be- tween the Cilician plain and the pass over the Amanus Mountains. The more modest architectural remains of subsequent centuries indicate the decline in the town's strategic and commercial significance, surely the result of the founding of Antioch and ports nearby at Seleucia and Alexandria (today's Iskenderun) and perhaps also a mark of the dam- aging effects on its harbors of erosion from the mountains. SESSION IIIF: POSTER SESSION PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE NEOPALATIAL POTTERY FROM THE COASTAL SETTLEMENTS AT MOCHLOS: Kel- lee A. Barnard, University of Pennsylvania, Thom- as M. Brogan, Bryn Mawr College, Costis Davaras, University of Athens, and Jeffrey S. Soles, Univer- sity of North Carolina at Greensboro Recent excavations at Mochlos in eastern Crete have un- covered two workshops on the coastal road behind the modern town and a small farmstead situated at the far eastern edge of the Mochlos plain. The pottery from these buildings indicates that all three were occupied only for a single phase during the Neopalatial period. Study of these assemblages offers important new insights into the chro- nology of the regional ceramics as well as the function and range of ceramic shapes associated with activities in the workshops and farmsteads of Neopalatial Crete. The detailed typology of the pottery stems from in-depth statistical analysis of shape, decoration, and fabric and also of the room-by-room distribution of specific vessels im- portant for the understanding and interpretation of these buildings. The extensive evidence for local ceramic pro- duction at both sites is presented as well as petrographic analysis of the coarse fabrics and chemical analysis of stor- age and cooking vessel contents. In conclusion, we address the relative and absolute chronology of the buildings. While study suggests that over- all the deposits are characteristic of the LM IB period, the interesting possibility that certain shapes and deco- rative motifs exhibit LM II characteristics has been noted. The discussion is framed by comparison with deposits from other LM IB destruction levels at Mochlos and from known LM II levels in central Crete and is supplemented with dates of short-lived radiocarbon samples from the site. CAMPAIGN IN THE CHORA OF TAURIC CHERSONESOS, 1996: Joseph Coleman Carter, Carl Holiday, Ruth Hargus, and Rachel Feit, University of Texas at Austin, Galina Nikolaenko, National Preserve, Tauric Chersonesos, Pamela Jerome and Norman Weiss, Columbia University The excavation of the Early Hellenistic Greek farmhouse on the Heraklean Peninsula in the territory (chora) of Cher- sonesos on the Black Sea, known as site 151, was completed at the end of this third season. Careful troweling over the whole site revealed successive pavements in the tower, other rooms, and courtyard. The study of all excavated materi- als from the 1994 to 1996 seasons was carried out at the same time. The relative and absolute chronology of the site and the functions of rooms and spaces is now clear. The two principal phases belong to the late fourth and early third centuries B.C., and to the second half of the third and early second centuries B.C. There was a brief reoccu- pation of the site in the Early Empire at which time a sec- ond structure, probably a barn (also excavated in 1996), was raised just to the south of the farmhouse. Besides approximately 10,000 pieces of pottery, there were numerous coins, stamped amphora handles and tiles (the best evidence for the absolute chronology of the site), and fragments of large-scale terracotta figurines, which to- gether with the aedicular shrine in the tower wall and al- tar reveal something of the cult life of the site. The whole extent of the farm of 26 ha was surveyed, and a section of the boundary road on the southwest was excavated to reveal its construction. Information about ter- race walls, planting walls, and secondary structures was recorded on the accurately surveyed site plan of the whole plot. The display includes four panels illustrating the devel-</page><page sequence="34">364 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 opment of the farmhouse in its principal phases, incor- porating the most important results of the excavation. A pilot project of site conservation was also carried out. Suitable solutions to the problems of replacing the mud mortar and grouting the walls were prepared as a test and left exposed. Museum restorers, who will monitor the site during the winter, were trained in state-of-the-art tech- niques. In addition, a section of the tower, toppled by van- dals during the last winter, was reerected. THE BLACK SEA PROJECT: EXCAVATIONS AT ANCIENT CHERSONESOS, 1994-1996: Douglas R. Edwards andJack Olive, University of Puget Sound, Gary Lindstrom, Black Sea Project, Robert S. MacLen- nan andJ. Andrew Overman, Macalester College, and MironJ. Zolotarev, Chersonesos Museum of History and Archaeology During three excavation seasons, 1994-1996, we have concentrated on an area west of an ancient fifth- or sixth- century basilica that was excavated from the 1930s to the 1960s. Finds from this area and in the archives provide evidence of a Jewish community possibly going back to the Hellenistic period. Our excavations have provided spa- tial and chronological evidence for the transformation of this area in the Late Hellenistic or Early Roman period. A synagogue was apparently located under the basilica near a commercial area associated with fish processing. The area was transformed in the fifth or sixth century when the Chris- tian basilica was built using material from earlier buildings. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND ANCIENT LAND DI- VISION IN THE TERRITORY OF METAPONTO: Brice L. Erickson, University of Texas at Austin Metaponto occupies an important place in the study of the Greek countryside, for it offers the earliest evidence of a plan for dividing rural land. Aerial photography in the 1950s first revealed traces of division lines, but impor- tant questions remain over their interpretation and the dimensions of the basic grid unit that divided Metapon- tine territory. Previous scholars have reconstructed grids varying in width anywhere from 180 to 240 m. Recent research has benefited from new sources of in- formation: evidence of rural settlement patterns from a survey conducted by the University of Texas, and the ex- cavation of an actual division line bordered by tombs at Pantanello. There is, in fact, a strong correlation across the entire countryside between burial and division line. With the as- sistance of a Geographic Information System (GIS), the distribution of tombs found on survey is compared against various proposals for the grid's size. Fully 59% of sixth- and fifth-century B.C. tombs fall near a division line when the grid is reconstructed at 210-m intervals (approximately 700 ancient ft), indicating rectangular units of that width constituted the land system. The principal division lines may have originally functioned as roads, alongside which burials were planted. These results demonstrate the im- pact of survey evidence and GIS in addressing questions of ancient land division. LM IIIC POTTERY ON PSEIRA: PIRATES, TRADERS, OR FISHERMEN? Cheryl R. Floyd, Temple University The conventional view of LM IIIC habitation on Crete stresses the retreat of the populace into the hills, away from the former coastal sites. The recent discovery of LM IIIC pottery on Pseira, however, represents a coastal presence that raises questions about the traditional explanation of settlement patterns in this late period. The Pseiran pottery from LM IIIC includes the deep bowl, the goblet, the stirrup jar, the flask, several types of cups, and other shapes. Parallels from Kastri at Palaikastro and other sites suggest it is from a developed part of the phase. The quantity and distribution of LM IIIC potsherds and the lack of identifiable LM IIIC architecture indicate a limited presence on Pseira. Since boats are required to reach Pseira, LM IIIC pot- tery on the island is particularly provocative. It is unlikely that the visitors were fishermen who lived in refuge settle- ments. No safe harborage exists on the north coast that would allow part-time fishermen to leave boats unattended for considerable lengths of time. The presence of LM IIIC people on Pseira requires that they were either "pirates" or traders. If the second scenario is true, it is difficult to imagine a total, or near total, abandonment of the coast. The LM IIIC settlement patterns in Crete may be more complex than previously suggested. Indeed, continuity of coastal sites into LM IIIC occurs at Khania, Katsambas, and Mochlos, in addition to Kastri, Palaikastro. THE 1995-1996 EXCAVATIONS AT POGGIO COLLA, VIC- CHIO (TUSCANY): Susan E. Kane, Oberlin College, P Gregory Warden, Southern Methodist Univer- sity, Dario Monna, Consiglio nazionale delle ri- cerche, Rome, and Paolo Canuti, Universita di Firenze Two seasons of excavation (1995 and 1996) were spon- sored by Southern Methodist University at the Etruscan site of Poggio Colla, located in the Mugello Valley north- east of Florence. The site was occupied from at least the Archaic through Early Hellenistic periods. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a monumental building, prob- ably an Archaic temple, with an unusual set of molded stone column bases and podium blocks. In addition, there is evidence for Late Classical-Early Hellenistic habitation zones, working areas, and fortifications, as well as an Ar- chaic necropolis, which includes a tumulus with a possibly unique stone roofing system. Among the finds are a fine Archaic bronze head of a statuette, a range of high-quality Archaic bucchero, imported Attic pottery, and local coarse and fine impasto wares. Discoveries were made at the site through a variety of approaches: excavation, geomorphol- ogy, GIS, geoarchaeological prospection (magnetometry,</page><page sequence="35">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 365 ground-probing radar, resistivity), materials analyses (ce- ramic thin-sections), and multi-media documentation (a CD, a World Wide Web site that was "semilive" during the excavation, extensive video and digital documentation of the excavation process, and the use of Quick Time Virtual Reality to create walk-throughs of certain areas of the site such as the Archaic tumulus). MYTH, LETTERS, AND ATTRIBUTES: INSCRIPTIONS IN EARLY ATTIC BLACK-FIGURE POTTERY: Martin E Kilmer, University of Ottawa Around 600 B.C., pottery painters in Attica began in- forming their audience that they were "telling" not a myth, but one specific myth: e.g., combat between Herakles and Nessos, not between "human and centaur." The names the Nettos Painter wrote on Athens 1002 allow us retrospec- tively to identify them on the amphora in the Metropol- itan Museum of Art (11.210.1) by the Painter of the New York Nessos. Providing labels for mythological figures so caught the imagination of early Attic black-figure painters that our visible myth-lexicon begins about 600 B.C. I focus on three painters: Sophilos (fl. 590-580); Kleitias (fl. 575-560); and the Painter of Acropolis 601, Kleitias's contemporary. The last of these painters is represented by inscribed fragments in Athens and London. The Athens fragments present a dedication and divinities in a formal context that needs exploration. Sophilos's Erskine dinos portrays the wedding of Peleus and Thetis; so also Kleitias's Frangois Vase. Sophilos's frag- mentary Athens dinos and a related vase show mytholog- ical weddings. Whose? Groupings of named divinities clar- ify the mythological subjects, which are not so certain as has been assumed. Sophilos captions Patroklos's funeral games; Kleitias gives a variant on the Frangois Vase. I explore the mythical contexts of these representations and the signaling systems early painters added to help their "readers" identify the specific myth and the "mythical mo- ment" illustrated. The written word was central to this effort, and is essential in the invention and growth of the visible attributes we use to identify characters and myths in later Greek art. STANDARDIZING TRADITIONAL CERAMIC REPORTS: PAST HISTORY AND FUTURE PROSPECTS: Charles C. Kolb, National Endowment for the Humanities During the past 60 years standards of ceramic descrip- tion for both physical and cultural properties and attri- butes were advanced by March, Shepard, Colton, Bennett, and Kolb, among others. Ecologically oriented methods and paradigms devised since the 1960s were pioneered by Matson, elaborated by Arnold and Kolb, and critiqued by Kramer. Since Shepard published her seminal work, Ceramics for theArchaeologist (1956), pottery studies have wit- nessed specialized examinations including provenience and provenance studies, chronometric determination, physico- chemical and mineralogical characterization, use-wear studies, residue analyses, engineering-oriented replication studies of performance characteristics, and behavioral anal- yses. These methodologies are exemplified in the works of Rye, Rice, Schiffer, Skibo, and Sinopoli, among others. Basic methodologies, promising new procedures, and trends toward humanistic themes can and should be in- corporated into a standardized reporting format. In this display I outline a procedural approach that in- cludes a consideration of 11 primary variables: 1) sampling methods; 2) classifications; 3) laboratory/analytical proce- dures; 4) report format (definitions of variables, reports on the previously published and unpublished literature, chronologies [relative and absolute], physical properties/ attributes, and cultural properties/attributes); 5) physico- chemical and other characterizations; 6) statistics; 7) cul- tural interpretations; 8) contexts and associations; 9) refined chronology; 10) cultural processes and dynamics; and 11) critique of methods and variables. This standardized re- porting method has been tested on Central Asian and Meso- american ceramics and it is suggested that its use will lead to enhanced comparability and efficacy in pottery analysis. THE MYCENAEAN POTTERY FOUND DURING THE UNI- VERSITY OF CHICAGO EXCAVATIONS AT MEGIDDO: AN APPRAISAL AND REANALYSIS: Albert Leonard, Jr., University of Arizona, and Eric H. Cline, Xa- vier University Evidence for 90 Mycenaean vessels was found at Megiddo (Israel) by the University of Chicago excavators during the 1920s and 1930s. Virtually all of these are of LH IIIA or IIIB (14th-12th centuries B.C.) manufacture, and together they form an important corpus of imported material that is systematically studied and presented here- for the first time- as a unit. Computer-generated, intra-site, locational analysis has demonstrated that each of the 55 Mycenaean vessels from Late Bronze Age settlement contexts (VIII, VIIB, and VIIA) at the site came from one of three general locations: in or near Palace 2041; in the vicinity of the city-gate; and in a cluster of residential buildings at the southern end of the site. Such a tight concentration contrasts sharply with the 24 Mycenaean vessels from funerary contexts, which, with the exception of seven examples from Tomb 912, are more widely distributed among 11 tombs on the southern slopes of the tell. A display of the date and distribution of the Aegean material is followed by a review of its significance for the broader topic of international commerce in the Late Bronze Age, in an attempt to place this important group of im- ports in its proper archaeological and historical context. METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER: A RARE ARCHAEO- LOGICAL EXAMPLE FROM THE ATHENIAN AGORA: Lisa M. Little, Indiana University, Bloomington Descriptions of various forms of cancer in ancient medi- cal texts, such as the Hippocratic Corpus, attest to the an-</page><page sequence="36">366 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 tiquity of the disease in Greece. Despite this literary evi- dence, there is a marked paucity of archaeologically derived skeletal specimens that exhibit cancerous lesions. Accord- ing to M.D. Grmek, Diseases in the Ancient Greek World (Bal- timore 1989) 72, the only known example is a possible case of metastatic carcinoma of Late Bronze Age date. How- ever, this example, identified by J. Lawrence Angel, is un- published. The lack of skeletal examples may be indica- tive of the low frequency of the disease in Greece or the tendency of death to precede the metastasis of soft tissue cancer to skeletal tissue. An example of metastatic carcinoma has recently been identified during the reexamination (original analysis by Angel in 1949) of the skeletal remains recovered during the 1939 excavation of the Hephaisteion. The skeletal re- mains were excavated from a medieval burial vault below the floor of the Hephaisteion cella. A minimum of nine individuals, including both adults and subadults, were con- tained within the vault. The specimen that is the subject of this study is a mature adult male with pathological le- sions on the innominates and femora. The lesions, char- acterized as osteophytic new bone addition, are consistent with the bony changes resulting from the metastasis of a slow moving primary carcinoma. Coupled with the sex and age of the individual, the nature of the lesions and their locations suggest a primary cancer of the prostate gland. LAND SNAIL ANALYSIS IN CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY: Michael MacKinnon, University of Alberta Land snails are commonly encountered during archae- ological excavation of classical sites, but rarely recovered and analyzed. There is much, however, that their study can contribute not only to our understanding of the processes involved in the formation of these sites, but also to our reconstruction of life and land in the ancient world. This presentation examines two applications of land snail anal- yses in classical archaeology, with particular reference to Roman Italy. First, land snail analyses can assist in environmental re- construction. Individual species of snails survive best in certain ecological conditions such as shaded areas or open country. The relative proportions of these species can in- dicate the ratio of forest to grassland around the site on a general level. At a more specific level, however, they can also assist in determining architectural features such as darkened, shaded, or lit areas of the site, which, in turn, can aid in clarifying room design and function. Second, since many kinds of land snails are edible, it is possible that some of their remains are introduced into the archaeological record by humans, and thus may in- dicate aspects of ancient diets. Pliny the Elder (HN 9.82) and Varro (Rust. 3.14.2-4) describe the methodology and technology related to raising and breeding snails. Deter- mining the context of the deposit from which the snails are recovered, and the frequency and size of the species relative to natural populations, may indicate if, and to what degree, the ancient occupants of the site ate snails. POTTERY FROM THE UNDERWATER FINDS AT PSEIRA: Katherine May, Temple University In 1993 and 1994 the pottery found in 1976 byJacques Cousteau off the eastern coast of Pseira, Crete, was exam- ined. In addition to assigning a relative date to the mate- rial, important new insight is provided into the pottery's relation to the nearby Bronze Age town and its relation to other underwater finds near Pseira. The study concludes that a relative date of MM II may be assigned to the pottery based on the similarity of the vessels to the pottery at Pseira, Malia, Vasilike, and Gour- nia. This deposit is different in both date and recovery spot from another group of underwater finds made by Lea- tham and Hood in 1954. Although it has been assumed in the past that all the pottery in the sea at Pseira was deposited in the same man- ner, this study suggests otherwise. The recovery of the ves- sels in the earlier project was from shallower water; the pottery was dispersed among building material, as one would expect from buildings and building contents that slipped into the sea. The vessels brought up by the Cousteau crew not only came from water that was much deeper, but also the vessels were stacked and fused together, suggest- ing a shipwreck. ARCHAEOLOGY-DIG IT: AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROJECT: Mark and Rhett Moak, Rocky Mountain College In the spring of 1993, we were asked by Jo Swain, an elementary school principal, to submit proposals for an educational project that focused on archaeology for students in kindergarten through sixth grade. A commit- tee of parents, teachers, and the principal chose our most energetic idea. This poster display presents the planning and imple- menting of this educational project: construction of the site and artifacts and subsequent excavation conducted ac- cording to the British School's system of trenches and zem- bils. This includes the organization and running of an apotheke that produces museum-style displays. Our exca- vation was a Minoan site since our experience has been working at such a site at Palaikastro, Crete, for several sea- sons. This project was implemented at Poly Drive Elemen- tary School in Billings, Montana, from late August through November 1993. The success of this project proves such an endeavor is possible and we believe it benefits students in the follow- ing ways: 1) Archaeology can and should bring together all subjects that elementary students traditionally study. We believe that true education involves learning from the interconnectedness of subjects and this project is an ex- cellent vehicle for an interdisciplinary approach. 2) The project provides for hands-on learning experiences and can be adapted for any level. 3) This type of experience builds a sense of community and enthusiasm for education. Our project reached beyond the elementary school to the community, heightening understanding of and appre-</page><page sequence="37">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 367 ciation for archaeology. It is an experience that continues to enrich these students' lives. LOCAL AND REGIONAL POTTERY PRODUCTION IN LATE HELLENISTIC AND IMPERIAL EPHESOS: Ulrike Outschar, Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften The seaport of Ephesos- center of the Roman govern- ment and residence of the governor from 28 B.C.- was one of the most important trading centers and places of trans- shipment for different consumer goods and ceramic prod- ucts in Asia Minor. It was also a production center of pot- tery for the local market and for export, mainly to the eastern Mediterranean. This development already seems to begin in the middle of the second century B.C., when trade via the Greek islands toward the west and to the Greek mainland became more and more intensive. Local production of high-quality pottery already in the late fourth century B.C. is suggested by the inscription IvE 1420. The high craftsmanship and knowledge about the production of the very popular shiny black glazed pottery of Late Classical and Hellenistic times was obviously the cause for granting Ephesian citizenship to two Attic pot- ters, Chittos and Bacchios, by the demos and the council of the city. At the same time we have to assume a local production of simple tableware, cooking, and storage pot- tery, which supplied households and agricultural activities. THE GRAPHIC RESTORATION OF ROMAN MOSAICS IN TUNISIA: A WORK IN PROGRESS: Charles Peirce, New York Society This poster display documents an ongoing pilot project begun in 1988 in cooperation with the Tunisian Heritage Institute to reconstruct in polychrome graphic form Ro- man mosaics in Tunisia dating from the third to the sixth centuries A.D. The collection of paintings of restored mo- saics, small by corpus standards, is the largest ever assem- bled for North Africa. The paintings are acrylic on Mylar, based on accurate orthogonal color photographs and on precise paletting of the mosaic colors. The product is unique and results in the salvaging in portable and reproducible form many fragmentary mosaics otherwise doomed to obscurity or loss. The scale, which varies from 1:4 to 1:9, is determined by the dimension of the fillets in each mosaic. The focal point of the display is a case study with comparanda of an apsidal pictorial mosaic in situ in the Carthage archaeological park. A STANDARDIZED SCHEME FOR DESCRIBING ARCHAE- OLOGICAL MARBLE: Scott Pike, Wiener Laboratory, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The need for a uniform descriptive system of archae- ological marble is apparent. The subjective use of descrip- tive terms leads to confusion among scholars who have differing sets of standards of measurement. One person's concept of medium grain size may be another's fine grain. With the aid of hand samples from Mount Pentelikon, Mount Hymettos, Paros, Naxos, and Thasos, a standardized methodology and vocabulary for describing archaeologi- cal marble is suggested. This proposed method alleviates much of the subjectivity that has characterized descriptions of marble. A scale is provided from which marble grain size can be determined. Terms referring to the fabric of marble, including foliation and lineation, are explained and demon- strated with a variety of hand samples. Color is described with the use of color identification charts and chips. Samples with accessory mineral assemblages are shown to illustrate the types of accessory minerals often seen in marbles, from white mica to chlorite to pyrite. With the accepted understanding that marble provenance cannot be determined based on macroscopic features alone, this presentation emphasizes the need for a common vocab- ulary for marble description that avoids the use of am- biguous terms and assumed provenance. THE MARBLE TYPE OF THE STATUE OF AUGUSTUS FROM PRIMA PORTA: NEW SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THE POSSIBLE SYMBOLIC VALUE OF PARIAN LYCHNITES MARBLE:John Pollini, University of Southern Cali- fornia, Norman Herz, University of Georgia, and Kyriaki Polikreti and Yannis Maniatis, Demokritos Institute of Material Science, Athens Because of a mistaken belief that lychnites marble could only be obtained in relatively small blocks, it has generally been assumed that the famous heroic-sized statue of Au- gustus from Prima Porta was carved in Luna, Dokimeion, or Pentelic marble. The first isotopic analysis performed on a marble sample from the statue at the Center for Archaeological Sciences, University of Georgia, suggested it was probably carved in Parian lychnites marble. Scholars, however, have remained skeptical because this first analy- sis showed an overlap with a marble type from Ephesos also used in sculpture. Recent additional scientific tests (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and max- imum grain size, at the Laboratory of Archaeometry, De- mokritos) now show conclusively that the statue of Augus- tus from Prima Porta was carved in Parian lychnites marble, thereby disproving the old theory about the availability of only relatively small blocks of lychnites. In high-quality Roman portrait statues, the finest white marbles were generally used for the head and exposed limbs of the body. Because lychnites was used exclusively for the entire Prima Porta statue, which embodied many ideolog- ical and symbolic values, there may also have been another reason for the choice of this specific type of marble. Based on ancient written sources, the use in this case of the pur- est of all white Greek marbles may have had symbolic im- plications underscoring Augustus's physical beauty and ethical-moral purity. The new conclusions reached also</page><page sequence="38">368 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 demonstrate the need for more collaboration among sci- entists, art historians, and archaeologists. DOG BURIALS IN THE GREEK WORLD: THE ANIMALS FROM AN EARLY IRON AGE TOMB AT KAVOUSI: Lynn M. Snyder, Smithsonian Institution, and Walter E. Klippel, University of Tennessee The recovery of animal bones in association with an- cient human burials is not uncommon, however, the inter- pretation of their origins and possible funerary signifi- cance is often problematical. During the summer of 1981 an assemblage of animal bones was recovered by the Kavousi Project, from an Early Iron Age tholos tomb in East Crete. This previously unexcavated tomb was part of a small Sub- Minoan through Protogeometric cemetery originally in- vestigated by Harriet Boyd Hawes in 1900. Although the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, the presence, apparently below floor level, of the skeletons of as many as 12 domestic dogs suggested that the animals might have been purposefully buried at the time of tomb con- struction. In order to investigate more precisely the prob- able origins of the dog skeletons, as well as other animal remains recovered from the tomb matrix, a recent reanalysis of all faunal remains from the tomb was undertaken. Using modern zooarchaeological techniques, the age at death, health, and stature of each of the dogs was es- timated. These data were then compared to other ancient skeletal remains, and modern animals from Crete. The nature of the dog remains, plus the presence within the tomb matrix of additional scattered skeletal elements of domestic cat, pig, sheep, goat, rabbit, and hedgehog, in- dicates that these remains most probably represent the disposal of animal carcasses in the robbed tomb during the Byzantine period rather than purposeful Bronze Age funerary deposits. FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTRY AT LEPTIMINUS, TUNISIA: David L. Stone and Sebastian ES. Heath, University of Michigan, Nejib Ben Lazreg, Institut national du patrimoine de Tunisie, and DavidJ Mattingly, University of Leicester As the objects of a diachronic field survey since 1990, the town and territory of ancient Leptiminus permit the study of material manifestations of urban-rural relations in Roman North Africa. With the aid of a Geographic In- formation System (GIS) constructed for the analysis of the survey data, we are currently investigating the surface ar- chaeology of the town and its countryside. The GIS, im- plemented in MapInfo and ARC/INFO, facilitates compar- ison of spatial and chronological data relating to activities in these locations. For example, we can demonstrate that metalworking and ceramic production occur only in the urban area, while grain processing takes place in both ur- ban and rural zones. The use of marble, mosaic, and vault- ing tubes in Roman buildings is also geographically re- stricted, but hydraulic masonry is not. Findspots of coins and inscriptions suggest that their use was largely limited to the town. Quantifying these patterns in distributions of surface artifacts rather than relying on unsystematic recording provides a step forward in discussions of the productive and administrative relationships between town and country in the ancient world. Our regional analysis suggests that the two areas formed an integrated produc- tive unit, which in turn should be the basis for understand- ing Leptiminus's role in the Roman empire. This study has wider implications for computer applications in classical archaeology and surface survey methodology. MAPS FOR THE ATLAS OF THE GREEK AND ROMAN WORLD: RichardJ.A. Talbert, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The varied range of maps in proof produced during 1996 are exhibited, together with the accompanying text and detailed listings for each (the latter aimed at scholarly users), prior to joint publication of the Atlas and Map-by- Map Directory by Princeton University Press and Scholars Press respectively in 1999. For the first time, maps at all four of the scales adopted by the Atlas are represented- 1:150,000 (for the environs of the three great centers- Athens, Byzantium/Constantinople, Rome); 1:500,000 (for the core of the classical world); 1:1,000,000 (for the periph- ery); and 1:5,000,000 (for yet more distant regions, such as the Indian subcontinent). All maps at 1:1,000,000 scale (47 in total) are produced on computer from a digital base. The maps displayed illustrate the continuing advance- ment of thisjoint APA/AIA project to create the first major classical atlas in well over a century with the collaboration of more than 100 scholars, each an expert on the physical, cultural, and archaeological landscape of one or more re- gions in antiquity. Coverage by the 99 maps (spread over 175 folio pages) stretches from the British Isles to Central Asia, and far up the Nile Valley. The session gives mem- bers an extended opportunity to learn more about the ra- tionale, materials, and production methods of the project, and to discuss these with the editorial team. A LATE MINOAN WELL AT PALAIKASTRO: Stuart E.M. Thorne, British School at Athens, Eleni Chatzaki, Oxford University, J.A.M. MacGillivray, Colum- bia University, and L.H. Sackett, Groton School Two Minoan wells were excavated in the 1994 excavations in area VI at Palaikastro, East Crete. The excavation of a third in building V was completed. All were initially sunk in the Late Minoan IB period. While the well in building V was sealed in the LM IB destruction, the two from area VI remained open and collected refuse through subsequent periods of occupation at the site. One of these, well 576, has been studied. The exceptional size of this well-some 3 m in diameter at its terminus 9.25 m below the ancient surface level- allowed the con- struction of a section drawing from top to bottom. This forms the basis of a stratigraphical report. Changes in the</page><page sequence="39">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 369 type of fill, in pottery shapes, faunal remains, and in the composition and condition of sherd material, mirror events and activities taking place around the well head from the beginning of the LM IB period through LM IIIA2-B and the gradual abandonment of the area. An examination of the environmental and geological contri- butions to the processes of filling the shaft helps to punc- tuate some of the historical inferences that can be drawn. ON THE ATTRIBUTION TO THASOS OF DOLOMITIC MAR- BLE SCULPTURE AND ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS: Robert H. Tykot, University of South Florida,John J. Herrmann, Jr., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and NikolaasJ. van der Merwe, Harvard University The application of scientific methods of analysis to marble sculptures has facilitated provenance studies of individual pieces, the assessment of composite restorations, and research into patterns of quarry exploitation in the ancient Mediterranean world. A single analytical technique, however, is rarely sufficient to attribute unambiguously a provenance for a marble object. The elemental and isotopic compositions of many quarries overlap with one another, as do the physical properties revealed by cathodolumines- cence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. An exception to this rule is the Cape Vathy source on the island of Thasos in the northern Aegean, which appears to have been the only dolomitic marble source used in the Mediterranean region. The importance of this source throughout antiquity has been discussed elsewhere; here we present analytical data for 75 sculptures from Ameri- can and European museums that demonstrate that all are both dolomitic and have a single isotopic signature- that of Cape Vathy. These results indicate that a simple, inex- pensive, and essentially non-destructive "dolomite test" can be used to determine whether a marble piece is from Cape Vathy.

MOCHLOS SITE MAP AND DATABASE: INTERACTIVE LINKAGE: Christopher L. Witmore,John G. Pleasants, Jr.,Jeffrey C. Patton, andJeffrey S. Soles, University of North Carolina at Greensboro This system demonstrates the potential for using inex- pensive Geographic Information System (GIS) and data- base software to create archaeological site maps and to link them to related databases. It was developed at the Uni- versity of North Carolina at Greensboro by the presenters. Data from the Bronze Age and Hellenistic site at Moch- los, Crete, was recorded using Atlas GIS and Foxpro rela- tional database software. A map of Mochlos displaying con- tours, bathymetry lines, occupational levels, and associated features was created by combining several maps at various scales into a single composite. The database contains in- formation about the artifact assemblage including location, type, classification, description, and, in some cases, photo- graphs. General descriptions and artifact information are linked to the associated areas on the map and can be ac- cessed by clicking on the desired area. The database in- cludes a query function that allows the user to access the data in a variety of ways. SESSION IVA: COLLOQUIUM IN HONOR OF R. ROSS HOLLOWAY: IMAGE AND MEDIUM IN ANCIENT ART AND COINAGE FEMALE SEXUALITY AND DANAE AND THE GOLDEN RAIN: Frances Van Keuren, University of Georgia Illustrations of Danae receiving Zeus's impregnating golden rain are more reliable indicators of female sexual response to the attentions of the gods than vase paintings showing gods pursuing other mortal women; for Danae is shown in the sexual act of conceiving her heroic son Perseus. The period of production of Athenian vases with Danae parallels the era when divine pursuits were most popular on Athenian vases, that is from 500 to 425 B.C.; the myth is also attested on two Athenian vases from the late fifth and fourth centuries. Beginning with the earliest Athenian depiction, where the maiden binds her hair like a bride, Danae is shown to "welcome" the golden rain, as in Pherekydes' account (FGrHist 3 F10). Even pursuit scenes are subject to new readings not involving divine coercion of mortals. Mary Lefkowitz has pointed out that "the woman moves away from [the god] ... but looks back, as if drawn to him." If depictions of both types of encounter are cor- rectly interpreted as positive female responses to uncoer- cive divine sexual interest, then these images of apparently ideal consensual relationships may reveal a gentler attitude of Greek men toward their wives than is frequently assumed. They may indicate that Athenian men felt giving sexual pleasure to their mates was desirable. The belief found in Hippocratic and other ancient medical literature that wives had to experience orgasm to become pregnant may have provided practical inducement for Athenian husbands to give pleasure to their wives. EARLY BRONZE AGE SICILIAN GEOMETRIC DECORA- TION: ITS ORIGIN AND RELATIONSHIP TO VESSEL FORM: Susan S. Lukesh, Hofstra University The painted geometric decoration of Early Bronze Age Castelluccian pottery ranges from mundane to rich, com- plex compositions. As most decoration, it serves to iden- tify groups, marking social identities, expressing social differences, and indicating shared geographical and/or pro- duction areas. Castelluccian decoration also suggests the possibilities of strong influence from textile and wicker- work, even though Alois Riegl argued close to 100 years ago against Gottfried Semper's technical-materialist theory of the origin of geometric art. Riegl attempted to dem- onstrate that the invention and development of the geo- metric style around the globe need not derive from the</page><page sequence="40">370 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 tangible and material influence of woven textile and wick- erwork. I explore the possible textile and basketry influ- ences on Castelluccian painted decoration, the relation- ship of such decoration to the pot itself (and what this contributes to the argument of origins), as well as the abil- ity of at least one Castelluccian painter to surpass the lim- itations of derivation from textile and basketry production. This final point is one that might have allowed Riegl to accept a technical-materialist origin of some geometric decoration as it demonstrates convincingly the artist's abil- ity to break the bounds of craft production and create some- thing attaining to fine art. EXEKIAS'S "SUICIDE OF AJAX": SOCIAL COMMENTARY IN ARCHAIC GREEK ART:JosephJ. Basile, Maryland Institute, College of Art That Exekias's art contained subtle political and social statements was first recognized by Boardman. In "Exekias," AJA 82 (1978) 11-25, Boardman examines the subject mat- ter of Exekias's painted scenes, suggesting that certain ones dealing with the Trojan War represent allusions to contem- porary politics. Specifically, the famed Vatican vase, which shows Ajax and Achilles engaged in a board game (while, presumably, the Trojans storm the beached Greek ships), is seen as a statement on the inaction of the aristocratic class in the face of the third return of the tyrant Peisistra- tos and his sons. This paper seeks to demonstrate that another of Exekias's famous vases, "The Suicide of Ajax" (Boulogne-sur-Mer 558), can also be seen in this light. Specifically, the paper ex- amines the role of Ajax in Athenian thought in the Late Archaic and Classical periods (for instance, in the plays of Sophocles); in addition, the general impact of Exekias's small painted scenes is explored, in order to examine ques- tions regarding scale, material, and medium, and the roles they play in the conveyance of meaning in ancient art. I submit that Ajax and his suicide are symbols of the resis- tance of the aristocratic class to the ever-increasing de- mands of the emerging democratic polis, in both the lit- erature of Athens and the art of Exekias. THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS OLYMPIOS AT AKRAGAS: AR- CHAIC TEMPLE OR EARLY CLASSICAL VICTORY MON- UMENT? Barbara A. Barletta, University of Florida The Temple of Zeus Olympios is one of the more un- usual examples of Greek architecture. It exceeded all other Doric temples in overall size and column diameter, but employed half-columnsjoined to wall segments for its "peri- style" and piers in the walls of an apparently hypaethral cella. Since, according to Diodorus Siculus (11.25), labor for many of the Akragantine temples was supplied by Car- thaginian prisoners from the Battle of Himera in 480 B.C., characteristics of the plan and decoration are often ex- plained as resulting from Carthaginian influence or the role of the temple as a thank-offering. Thus, Atlas figures found on site may be seen as prisoners and the sculpture mentioned by Diodorus (13.82) and assigned to the pedi- ments, a Gigantomachy and an Ilioupersis, is thought to allude to Greek victory. This paper casts doubt on that interpretation. It con- nects the plan with developments in Western Greek archi- tecture in the Late Archaic period rather than in the Early Classical "victory" temples. While the Atlantids show Se- vere Style traits, the rendering of many with long hair and diadems suggests that females as well as males are repre- sented. Moreover, the subjects of the now fragmentary "pedi- mental" sculptures appear in temples both with (Parthenon) and without (Temple of Artemis, Corcyra) acknowledged political associations. It is therefore likely that the build- ing was initiated before 480 B.C. as a temple for Zeus, in- dependent of a commemoration of victory. IMAGE AND ANCESTRY IN ETRURIA: Anthony Tuck, Brown University The study of Etruscan art and iconography has spent decades in the shadow of the Greek world. All too often, the art of the Etruscans has been judged by its deficient Greekness rather than examined within its own context. This paper seeks to examine the role of early Etruscan ar- chitectural decoration within the social and political en- vironment of the seventh century B.C. Some scholars have already connected early architec- tural decoration at sites such as Murlo and Acquarossa with aspects of aristocratic display. At Murlo, we are for- tunate to have not only an aristocratic habitation, but also the remains of a multidimensional workshop. Like the hab- itation, the workshop was elaborately decorated, suggest- ing an aristocratic association, with activities carried out in both buildings. Among the various items in production at the workshop prior to the destruction of both buildings were elements of architectural decoration including human- headed antefixes. Several scholars have connected antefixes of this type to ancestral funerary masks. I argue in this paper that the aristocratic control over production of such images is specifically related to an Etrus- can aristocratic social context. The emphasis on family and ancestral motifs, often recognized in Etruscan funerary art, appears again in such architectural decoration. Within the aristocratic atmosphere of early Etruria, the imagery of ancestry was a necessary component of aristocratic dis- play, reaffirming social roles by the control over and rep- resentation of the heraldic images of family association. WHERE HAVE ALL THE ANCESTORS GONE? SOCIAL REPRODUCTION AND ANCESTRAL IDEOLOGY IN RO- MAN HOUSES: Owen Doonan, University of Chi- cago Images of ancestors were employed in Roman houses in the process of social reproduction. From the founda- tion of the Republic until the onset of civil war, economic and social position were determined largely by the achieve- ments of one's ancestors. A sacred family ideology based on agnatic genealogy was supported by household ritual</page><page sequence="41">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 371 and representations of male progenitors with distinguished political and military careers. Emphasis on diachronic family structure waned during and following the civil wars of the Late Republic. As new families entered the senatorial ranks and old ones disap- peared, social connections and current economic stand- ing replaced family history as critical to the production and maintenance of power. Indexical displays of wealth superseded canonical displays of ancestral achievement. Ancestral representation in the house declined as an in- stitution and the material culture associated with it took on new meanings. As scale and material wealth replaced family history as the focus of elite display, the atrium, loaded with ancestral connotations, fell out of fashion. This paper explores changes in the representation of ancestors in Roman houses based on textual evidence from Pliny, Polybius, and other sources. Imperial sources describ- ing the use of imagines consistently maintain an opposition between the sacred character of earlier use and the deca- dence of current use. Plans and decorative programs of townhouses from Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Ostia pro- vide evidence for the changing architectural context struc- turing commemorative practice. FROM SACROSANCTITAS TO APOTHEOSIS: SEVENTY- SEVEN YEARS OF LIVIA IMAGES: Rolf Winkes, Brown University Literary and epigraphic sources show that the image- making for Livia was, from the beginning, one of the pri- orities of the propaganda of Octavian, already begun before Actium and gradually increasing thereafter. During the life of Augustus, Livia acquired a role that was without parallel for Roman women before that period as well as for her contemporaries. Upon the apotheosis of Augustus she became an intricate part of the imperial cult and she assumed under Tiberius a status that resembled almost a co-regency. Her imagemaking reached its climax under Claudius with her own apotheosis. Numismatic evidence - mostly Greek Imperial coins-as well as representations in sculpture and on cameos reflect this systematic expan- sion of her role. MANLINESS AND TIME IN REPUBLICAN COINAGE: Nat- alie Boymel Kampen, Barnard College One of the striking features of Republican coins of the later third and second centuries is their emphasis on a small number of stereotypical and repeating rituals enacted by unidentifiable men. Whether the coins show men stick- ing a pig in a military oath ritual or men casting votes in an election, these early coin types emphasized standard- ized scenes meant to be understood as marking temporal intervals while at the same time functioning as indexes of temporal continuity. I argue here that, in contrast to the depiction of women and immortals, mortal men are represented on the coins of this period as makers of a special and gendered con- cept of time, time that is fundamentally social and collec- tive, centered on evincing the relationship of mortal Ro- man men to civic space and civic responsibility. Enduring into the Imperial period, this kind of representation helps to illuminate both Roman notions of manliness in histor- ical representations of a later period and in other media and also Roman methods for evoking a conservative rela- tionship to tradition and mores maiorum. SESSION IVB: ITALY AND NORTH AFRICA GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MU- GELLO VALLEY, ITALY:Jon Berkin, R. Christopher Goodwin and Associates, and Frank Vento, Clar- ion State University During the summers of 1995 and 1996, geoarchaeolog- ical investigations were undertaken within the Sieve River drainage basin in the Mugello Valley, Italy. This geoarchae- ological study sought to assess the archaeological poten- tial of the valley terraces. The investigation focused on the genetic stratigraphy of the valley and consisted of the de- tailed mapping of the Sieve River terraces and their asso- ciated soils. The preliminary results of the study indicate that at least five Pleistocene Age fluvial terraces exist within the Mu- gello Valley. The lower terraces are of a probable Late Wis- consinan (Wiirm) Age and each has the potential to con- tain temporally distinct, stacked, buried solas (genetic units) with in situ archaeological materials. The genetic units (buried A and B horizons) present on these lower terraces can be correlated with changes in climate and base level adjustments. Alternatively, the two upper terraces are of probable Early Wisconsinan/Illinoian (Wiirm/Riss) through Kansanan (Mindel) Age. Neolithic-Upper Palaeolithic ar- tifact assemblages should be confined to the upper pack- age of the soil profile on these upper two terraces. A limited archaeological survey also was undertaken in the valley below the acropolis of the Etruscan settle- ment ofPoggio Colla. Pedestrian reconnaissance and shovel testing revealed the existence of intact, buried deposits of archaeological materials and features within the study area. Future work will include a reconstruction of the Pleis- tocene and Holocene palaeoenvironments of the Mugello Valley. This information in combination with the continued refinement of the genetic stratigraphy of the terraces will be utilized to generate a predictive model of settlement location. EXCAVATIONS AT CHIANCIANO TERME, TUSCANY: Da- vid Soren, University of Arizona The 1995 campaign of the University of Arizona at Chi- anciano Terme, southeast Tuscany, followed a 1993 season led by Guilio Paolucci of the Chiusi Museum and revealed extensive Etruscan and Roman ruins. Etruscan remains include a 33 x 21 m pool, surrounded by colonnaded walk-</page><page sequence="42">372 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 ways, that is still fed by an underground water source. This pool, unique in Etruscan archaeology, shows that the Etrus- cans recognized the special properties of Chianciano water. The pool, dating to the second century B.C., is lined with waterproof mud. After a period of decline, the structure was rebuilt in Roman concrete. Another important feature is an Etruscan building of unknown use with an antechamber and a large rectangu- lar main room. Its ashlar foundations remain, but its wooden superstructure along with its roof tiles burned and collapsed into a swampy area. Preserved portions of the wooden columns and roof beams provide a unique op- portunity to study Etruscan timber building techniques. Peter Kuniholm, Karen Adams, and Rex Adams will gather wood specimens, reconstruct the palaeoenvironment, and correlate the new tree ring information with current den- drochronological data for Italy. ROMAN KILNS AND POTTERY PRODUCTION AT LEPTI- MINUS, TUNISIA: RESULTS OF THE 1995 AND 1996 EXCAVATIONS: Lea M. Stirling, University of Man- itoba, and Nejib Ben Lazreg, Institut national du patrimoine de Tunisie Since 1990, a joint Tunisian-American-Canadian team has been conducting interdisciplinary research into the economy of Leptiminus, a Roman port city in Tunisia. In 1995 and 1996, excavation focused on a kiln site east of the city. Two well-preserved kilns were excavated. One re- tained its walls, flue, stoking chamber, and a central pillar that once supported the firing floor. In the service chamber for the stoking hole of this kiln were several amphoras full of fuel. Dumps within the kiln mainly contained coarse ware casseroles. A larger kiln held loose fills with high con- centrations of large sherds from coarse ware pitchers and amphoras, including two complete vessels. Though the con- tents of the two kilns are distinctive, all pottery appears to date to the first to third centuries. The service chamber to the loading hole of the larger kiln was partially explored. Walls and floors around the kilns were investigated and parts of the wall of a third kiln were exposed. Geophysical testing shows that there are four other kilns in the vicinity and that the six kilns are organized in a line. Preliminary results suggest that a single compound con- tained many kilns, each specialized for different types of' pottery. The Leptiminus kilns are among the first in Tu- nisia to be scientifically excavated, and when integrated with other results from the project, will tell us much about the technology, organization, products, and ecology of the ceramic industry of North Africa. THE ROMAN BATHS OF THE PALACE OF GORDIAN AT VOLUBILIS, MOROCCO: Sonia Hewitt, McMaster University In this paper I reexamine the baths of the so-called Pal- ace of Gordian at Volubilis from the perspective of advances in bath studies and recent research undertaken at the site. The building is named after an inscription commemor- ating the restoration of the house and baths under Gor- dian III. The 1958 publication of the building contains a brief description of the baths, identifying them as ac- cessible to the public from the street. It is now possible to clarify the access to individual rooms, which aids in interpreting the circulation of bathers. Traces of decora- tion indicate lavish use of marble revetment in most of the rooms. Variations in decoration suggest different func- tions for some of the apparently similar rooms. The un- heated part of the baths is unusually large for North Afri- can examples, especially those in domestic contexts, while the size of the heated rooms compares with that of the public baths at the site. The rooms with hypocausts dis- play the sequence of tepidarium, assa sudatio, and cella soli- aris, rather than the four rooms identified at the time of excavation. Five other baths at Volubilis belong to private houses, of which at least three were also accessible from the street. The number and size of the rooms in the baths of the Palace of Gordian set them apart from these baths. Similarly, their attachment to a large residential building distinguishes them from the three public baths at the site. EXCAVATIONS AT THE ROMAN THEATER IN CATANIA: Maria Grazia Branciforti, Soprintendenza ai Beni Culturali ed Ambientali di Catania The theater of Catania is among the most important monuments in the Roman city. Well known to local authors of the 16th and 17th centuries, the theater was partially explored at the end of the 18th century by Ignazio Patern6 Castello, the Prince of Biscari, during the rebuilding of the city after the devastating earthquake of 1693. Between 1950 and 1970 the Archaeological Superinten- dency of Syracuse demolished many of the houses built on the theater's cavea and restored some of its walls and began the excavation of the scaena. In 1991 the Superintendency for Cultural and Environ- mental Resources of Catania resumed work on the theater according to a general plan which includes systematic ex- cavation in the orchestra and a complete redrawing of the monument. The pulpitum with its fine sculptural deco- ration and the orchestra with its marble pavement in opus sectile have now been discovered. Many fine architectural elements of the scaenae frons have also been recovered. Future work is planned on the eastern parados and on the postscaenium. SESSION IVC: GREEK ARCHITECTURE AND TOPOGRAPHY THE CHALKOTHEKE ON THE ATHENIAN ACROPOLIS: FORM AND FUNCTION RECONSIDERED: Caitlin Down- ey, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities The Chalkotheke has long been considered a simple warehouse for military paraphernalia, yet its position next to the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis, as well as</page><page sequence="43">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 373 the physical and epigraphical evidence, contradicts this modest assessment. Architectural studies of the building have been few and have dwelt on the minutiae of technical details, while overlooking the Chalkotheke's most signifi- cant features. Based on a reexamination of the evidence, I suggest the following reconstruction. The stoa along the northern flank of the building was designed to imitate the older Athe- nian Stoa at Delphi--including the oblique angle of the end wall. This stoa served to display shields won in battle and formed part of a large area devoted to the display of dedications. The entrance to the Chalkotheke was through the east facade (not the north) and, lastly, an interior Ionic colonnade of two rows (resting on bases previously iden- tified as Byzantine) supported the roof, creating a spacious interior as in the opisthodomos of the Parthenon. More than a simple warehouse, the Chalkotheke was a conspicuous statement of the military power of Athens and would have been consistent with the Periclean vision of Athens that Pollitt argues is emphasized in the Parthe- non frieze (Studies in the History ofArt 49, forthcoming). Con- sequently, the Chalkotheke became a prototype for two Athenian arsenals- Philo's arsenal in Piraeus and the Hel- lenistic arsenal in the Athenian Agora. The evidence for other Greek arsenals, however, suggests that this partic- ular form of military ostentation was a purely Athenian phenomenon. THE ETEOCARPATHIAN DECREE (IG 13, 1454) AND THE CONSTRUCTION DATE OF THE ERECHTHEION: T Keith Dix, University of Georgia, and Carl A. Anderson, Michigan State University The Eteocarpathian decree records that the Eteocar- pathians sent a cypress beam to the Temple of Athena 'AOrl- v&amp;v Mco6ouoa in Athens. With the redating of the inscrip- tion from the early fourth century to ca. 445-430 by Lewis and Jameson, scholars can no longer assign the beam to a repair of the Erechtheion after a fire in 406/5. Meiggs proposed the Parthenon as the obvious candi- date for the cypress; but those elements most likely to have employed cypress, the doors and roof, must have been in- corporated before the temple was dedicated in 438. The decree would have to date very closely to the earlier end of the suggested chronological range; otherwise, the gift could not have arrived in time to be used for doors or roof. We argue that the Erechtheion is more likely the des- tination for the beam, and offer the following reconstruc- tion of events: 1) The demos authorized construction of the Erechtheion in the mid- or late 430s. The reuse ofunfluted column drums from the older Propylon in the foundations of the Erechtheion's north wall suggests that construction began some time before 431. 2) The stipulations of the decree itself connect Athenian intervention on Carpathos to the first appearance of the Eteocarpathians on the Athe- nian Tribute List, in 434/3. 3) In return for Athenian inter- vention on their behalf, the Eteocarpathians donated the cypress for use in the Erechtheion. The decree thus pro- vides previously unrecognized evidence that construction of the Erechtheion began in the late 430s. A DAY AT THE RACES: THE TYRANNICIDES IN THE FIFTH-CENTURY AGORA: Aileen Ajootian, Univer- sity of Mississippi Pausanias, Arrian, and Pseudo-Aischines locate the stat- ues of the Tyrannicides in the Athenian Agora near the Hellenistic Metroon, north of the Late Hellenistic Odeion of Agrippa, and east of the transplanted Temple of Ares. All these landmarks postdate the early fifth-century mon- ument by many centuries. When the sculptures were new, the northern Agora was an open space defined by Peisis- tratid installations. It served as an early performance ground, and was probably the site of military exercises. Panathenaic contests were most likely staged there even before the construction of the Classical race course east of the Altar of the 12 Gods. In the fifth century B.C., the main physical and ideological orientation of the Tyran- nicides' monument was to the nearby Panathenaic race- track, linking the sculptures with the time and place of Hipparchos's murder, and enhancing their heroic, even Homeric, status. We may glimpse the Tyrant-Slayers in a Panathenaic setting on a fragmentary late fifth-century oinochoe (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 98.936). The ob- ject standing near the sculptures in this scene is probably a turning post, establishing an athletic landscape, and per- haps alluding to festival competitions. The statues of the Tyrannicides visually reclaimed the Agora-and the Pan- athenaic festival- from the Peisistratids, protecting these institutions from future tyranny. The monument outlived its Classical setting. To understand its original meaning we must reconstitute its original civic landscape, just as we reconstruct the statues themselves. WHEN A THOLOS IS NOT A TOMB: THE NATURE OF ASKLEPIOS'S DIVINITY AND THE THYMELE AT EPI- DAUROS: KerriJ. Hame, Bryn Mawr College The interpretation of the tholos in the Sanctuary of As. klepios at Epidauros that has received the widest accep- tance identifies it as the fictive tomb of the hero Asklepios and the locale of his hero cult. In this paper I argue that there is no evidence to support a hero cult of Asklepios at Epidauros and, moreover, that the nature of Asklepios's divinity precludes the existence of a tomb for Asklepios. By the end of the sixth century B.C., the hero Asklepios, the patron of physicians, was elevated to godhead. At Epidauros, the worship of the god had superseded that of the mortal, and there is no place for hero worship in the sanctuary of the healing god Asklepios. Nor can one argue that Asklepios has a tomb because of his "chthonic nature" since Asklepios is not a chthonic deity. Although we can asso- ciate him with the chthonic realm because he once walked on the earth as a mortal, his divine power need not be associated with the earth or his burial plot. Ancient tra- dition stressed the importance of his birthplace rather than his final resting place. For an explanation of the tholos, I suggest that we must connect its construction to the period when other areas of the Peloponnese with Asklepieia were challenging Epidauros's claim to the birthplace of Asklepios.</page><page sequence="44">374 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 TOPOGRAPHICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY OF THE SANCTUARY OF ZEUS ON MT. LYKAION, ARCADIA: David Gilman Romano, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology During the summer of 1996 a topographical and archi- tectural survey of the aboveground remains of the Sanc- tuary of Zeus on Mt. Lykaion in Arcadia was undertaken by a team from the Mediterranean Section of the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania Museum. The specific objective of this project was to make a modern and highly accurate map of the sanctuary and its associated buildings and monu- ments by means of an electronic total station. The build- ings and structures surveyed include the ash altar of Zeus on the southern peak of Mt. Lykaion, the stone bases for the columns that supported the two golden eagles of Zeus slightly below the summit of the mountain, as well as the stoa, fountain houses, bath house, monument bases, xenon, exedra, seats, and the remains of a stadium and hippo- drome in the neighboring high mountain plateau. Earlier sketches and plans had been drawn by Blouet (1831-1858) and later by Curtius (1851). In the early 20th century the area was partially excavated by K. Kourouniotes of the Greek Archaeological Society with results published in the Prak- tika of 1909. A SCULPTED FUNERARY PRECINCT FROM HELLENIS- TIC RHODES: E.E. Rice, Oxford University The so-called Rider Relief from the urban necropolis of Karakonero, southeast of the ancient city of Rhodes, is a three-sided rock-cut courtyard decorated with a com- plex sculpted scene. It has been described by a few schol- ars, but the monument is not well known and has never been properly published. The sculpted frieze is badly eroded and visibly disintegrating, but the central scene comprises a naked man riding a donkey. He is flanked on right and left by various figures, including a man carrying an amphora, a satyr, a man pouring wine, an Isis figure, and a Nike. Whether the "Rider" is understood as the de- ceased or some deity, there are clear Dionysiac overtones in this scene, signaled by the presence of satyrs and wine. The iconography of the scene and the function of the pre- cinct merit detailed examination. The precinct is gener- ally assumed to be of Hellenistic date, like the surround- ing necropolis complex. The form of this sculpted temenos, unique in Rhodian territory on the island or adjacent main- land, is perhaps derived from analogous temenos precincts in Asia Minor, such as the fourth-century Alketas Tomb at Termessos in Pisidia and the "Heroon" at Go1basi-Trysa in Lycia. Ancient literary accounts of this period attest that Rhodian political intervention in southwestern Asia Mi- nor was pervasive and her domination harsh, but the ar- tistic influences from Asia Minor to Rhodes seen in this remarkable funerary precinct attest to intriguing cross- cultural currents not otherwise known from the historical record. REGRESSIVE PROGRESS: DESIGNING COLUMNS AT DI- DYMA AND AT PERGAMON: Lothar Haselberger, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania At issue are the different approaches for planning the entasis of columns as documented in the Hellenistic temple at Didyma and the Roman Imperial temple at the theater of Pergamon. The sophisticated ingenious design of third- century B.C. Didyma presents a stark contrast to the low- key solution of second-century A.D. Pergamon. While both solutions led on their different levels to results acceptable for refined marble buildings, this was clearly not the case at Didyma during the second or first century B.C. The di- sastrous results of miscalculation are still visible in the outline of the single column standing to its full 65-ft height and testifying to a million-dollar mistake of sorts. This hap- pened less than a stone's throw away from the third-century B.C. construction drawing in which an entasis had been designed in the most refined way for creating a curve so far known from all of antiquity. How "progressive" is technological progress? How effec- tive was the documentation and transmission of design? To what extent was this dependent on the willingness to accept paradigmatic solutions? In which way can regress be progress? The case studies of Didyma and Pergamon pre- sent uncomfortably contradicting evidence. SESSION IVD: MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN ECONOMY AND SOCIETY EXCAVATIONS AT CHRYSOKAMINO, CRETE, 1996: Philip P Betancourt and Cheryl R. Floyd, Temple University, and James D. Muhly, University of Pennsylvania Chrysokamino is a Minoan estate north of modern Kavousi in eastern Crete. The archaeological site consists of a large farmhouse with several outlying components. Excavations in 1996 were conducted at a metallurgical in- stallation and at the farmhouse. The Early Minoan copper smelting site is located on a headland overlooking the Aegean Sea about 500 m from the habitation site. Discoveries in 1996 include a small wooden building of apsidal shape with a hearth inside as well as many remains from the smelting operation. Early Minoan III pottery (White-on-Dark ware) was found on the floor of the building. Deposits of slag containing small amounts of copper are over 65 cm deep over a large area. Other finds include fragments of the smelting furnaces and pieces of pot bellows used for the draft. The habitation site presents a complex sequence of build- ing phases. A large, well-built structure, perhaps associated with LM I-II finds, lies under at least two subsequent LM IIIA building phases. These later structures were built largely of undressed rubble masonry. In the final phase, the habitation site consists of a three-roomed building.</page><page sequence="45">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 375 Notable finds from the first season include two stone ves- sels, several complete ceramic vessels, a sealstone, and a complete bronze dagger blade with rivets. The latest Mi- noan sherds found on the site appear to be LM IIIC in date. MINOAN STONE FURNITURE, LAMPS, AND ARCHITEC- TURAL ELEMENTS IN THE NEOPALATIAL PERIOD: THE SCULPTOR-MASON AS PALACE CRAFT SPECIALIST? Ann C. Blasingham, American School of Classi- cal Studies at Athens In the Neopalatial period, finely sculpted, large stone objects such as lamps, pieces of furniture, and architec- tural elements are found in central Cretan palaces and important houses. Their techniques of production, motifs, and style of ornament are significantly different from those associated with smaller stone objects such as sculpted rhyta. A close comparison suggests that such stone sculpted ob- jects of large scale may have been produced by a craft spe- cialist, termed here "sculptor-mason," probably to be asso- ciated with palace workshops. Two of the finest surviving stone lamps - the Lotus Lamp from the Palace at Knossos and the spiral ivy pedestal from the Southeast House - support this thesis. Their ornamen- tation is appropriately large to suit the scale of the lamps, and motifs are boldly schematized with simplified lines in relief and incision, emphasizing the shape, while the surface finish enhances the motifs. Smaller vessels with relief sculpture, such as stone cups and rhyta, exhibit a completely different approach: motifs and scenes seem to have been selected with less regard for the shape of these vessels, and composition and technique are much closer to small works in other media, such as faience or precious metals, for which a stone mold or matrix may have been used. Additional evidence from large decorated lamps, archi- tectural elements, stone furniture, and objects such as the octopus anchor from Knossos confirms the suggestion that their creation was the special province of sculptor-masons, craft specialists who should be differentiated from stone vase makers and sculptors of miniaturist reliefs. EROTICS AND POWER: A REEXAMINATION OF THE ZAK- ROS SEALINGS: Senta German, Columbia University In 1978 Sinclair Hood in his Arts ofPrehistoric Greece made the observation that in Minoan and Mycenaean art one does not find pornography or sexually explicit portrayal. Yet, in 1901, a large cache of stamp seal impressions was found at the Minoan palace ofKato Zakros in eastern Crete that included representations of part human-part animal creatures with erect penises, bared breasts, and spread legs. Since their discovery, these images have been variously interpreted as fantastic gods, fantasy forms, imitations of Egyptian art, accidental, or the result of an "over-heated, fever-stricken imagination." Their obviously erotic aspect, however, has never been recognized. Why has an erotic inter- pretation for these images never been explored, and what could such an interpretation mean within the larger frame- work of our understanding of Late Bronze Age Crete? In my paper I critically reexamine the sealings from Zakros. First, I explore the erotic and disturbing nature of these images with special attention to how the juxta- position of animal and human components renders a pro- vocative form. Next, I discuss the use and probable func- tion of these seals in LM IA Zakros. Lastly, I argue that the images found on the sealings functioned apotropai- cally in Zakros's intersite dealings within the possibly hos. tile atmosphere of the late Second Palace period on Crete. THE ROLE OF RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL IN MYCENAEAN WORKSHOPS: Susan Lupack, University of Texas at Austin The Linear B tablets provide much evidence demonstrat- ing the integral part that religious institutions played in Mycenaean economics. I am particularly interested in ex- amining the influence of the religious sphere in palatial workshops. PY An 1281, which was found in Pylos's Northeast Work- shop, speaks of Potnia allocating workers to foremen at her shrine. This tablet indicates that Potnia was consid- ered to preside over or protect an area that accommodated workers and, second, that the officials in her service had some administrative control over those workers. Further- more, female workers on KN G 820, an unguent boiler on PY Un 249, and 19 of the 304 bronzesmiths on the Pylian Jn series are designated as Potnian. We may surmise that they were working for the palace since they were being supported by palatial resources, but some religious con- nection is implied by their being designated as Potnian. Archaeological evidence appears to confirm the exis- tence of a shrine-workshop association: Pylos's only shrine was built as an integral part of the Northeast Workshop, and Mycenae had four workshop areas among the rooms of its cult complex. What was the exact nature of this as- sociation? Could the Potnian workers have been monk- craftsmen trained by the sanctuary, or were they secular workers whose profits were allocated for its support? In this paper I further discuss the archaeological evidence and the ways in which it can be used along with the texts to illuminate the shrine-workshop relationship. THE "PALATIAL CONTROL" OF PRODUCTION AND DIS- TRIBUTION IN A LATE BRONZE AGE STATE ECON- OMY: Michael L. Galaty, University of Wisconsin- Madison, and William Parkinson, University of Michigan Reconstructions of the Mycenaean economy tend to fo- cus almost exclusively on the information contained in Linear B archives. In this paper, however, we combine archaeological data collected by the Pylos Regional Archae-</page><page sequence="46">376 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 ological Project in Messenia, Greece, with Linear B data to define more accurately the extent to which primary cen- ters controlled the regional economy. We examine two com- ponents of the economic system that operated beyond the purview of palatial administration: the lithic and ceramic industries. The reduction sequence from the site of Ro- manou suggests that it was the sole producer of obsidian blades in the region during the later Bronze Age. All other sites were acquiring pre-manufactured obsidian blades in their finished form from Romanou, certainly not from the center. Application of ICP spectroscopy and petrographic analysis to 41 coarse ware sherds from six sites indicates six paste types and substantial intraregional exchange of ceramics. The tendency for paste types to cluster into geo- graphically distinct regions suggests that ceramics were produced by independent workshops and exchanged ac- cording to rules dictated not by the palace, but by the phys- iography of the region itself. We conclude that, although the Linear B tablets indicate a considerable interest on the part of the palace in the mobilization of "elite goods," it is incorrect to assume that control extended to all other aspects of the economy. The results of this research sug- gest that the Messenian state operated a system of "wealth finance" at the expense of "staple finance," an inherently unstable condition. MYCENAEAN BUILDING STANDARDS: Nancy Claire Loader, University of Durham Mycenaean monumental architecture, such as the for- tifications at Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea in the Argolid and Gla in Boeotia, is a testament to the considerable en- gineering skill of Mycenaean builders. The impetus to build such massive structures should be understood as a desire to display conspicuously the palace's wealth and domina- tion over the territory in which it was constructed. Yet, similar constructions and building methods suggest that a level of cooperation must have existed within commu- nities and between neighboring settlements over an ex- tended period of time. References in Linear B are made to "wall builders" and "sawyers," but no documentation or treatise exists to explain widespread and common build- ing techniques. In this paper I identify technology in re- lation to its basic standardization of technique and exam- ine how this may have been maintained in a period where architectural treatises are unknown. These are not inde- pendent developments within separate geographical re- gions of the Greek mainland; in some instances, building specifications are too similar to suggest anything other than a shared practice. Although it might be argued that the palace administrative system controlled the masons at each center (the center perhaps being dependent upon the pal- ace for payment in either foodstuffs or landholdings), it seems that masons may have exercised the right to move among communities acquiring and disseminating build- ing knowledge, and through such movement and interac- tions, building principles were shared. DECIPHERING GENDER IN MINOAN CLOTHING: Mireille M. Lee, Bryn Mawr College Although costume has always played an important role in the reconstruction of Minoan culture, no systematic framework has yet been formulated for the interpretation of clothing. For example, images of females wearing elab- orate dresses have been variously interpreted as goddesses, priestesses, or aristocratic women. In this paper I examine how the Minoan ideology of gender was reflected in pat- terns of dress. My basic premise is that Minoan clothing communicated complex social information about the wearer. Such infor- mation might have included, but is not necessarily limited to, sex, age, marital status, wealth, rank, group affiliation, or occupation. It is argued that anthropological and semi- otic models make it possible to reconstruct the code(s) of meaning in Minoan clothing. In this study, individual gar- ments are analyzed in terms of their form and decoration, as well as the way they fit the human body. Also consid- ered are "votive" garments, artistic representations of ac- tual garments that were meaningful even though they are not depicted being worn. The study of clothing provides important information not only about social constructions, but also about Minoan women. Because evidence suggests that women were pri- marily responsible for textile and clothing production, it is possible that they controlled certain social messages that were encoded in the garments, particularly in the deco- ration. Clothing is therefore also useful evidence for women's cognition. WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND THE FAMILY IN THE LATE AEGEAN BRONZE AGE: DIFFERENCES IN MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN CONSTRUCTIONS OF GENDER? Bar- bara A. Olsen, Duke University In this paper I examine the constructions of gender in the societies of the Late Helladic mainland and Late Mi- noan Crete and ask whether, in the period of Mycenaean domination, these societies define gender roles uniformly or in a manner specific to each ethnic group. I address in particular one aspect of societal structuring relevant to this debate, the association of women and children within the family unit, since child-rearing has long been assumed to be the primary social role of Aegean women. Evidence relevant to women's role in the raising of children stems primarily from two sources: the Linear B tablets of Knossos and Pylos, and LBA figurines, especially terracotta kourotro- phoi. The tablets from both administrative centers strongly suggest the actual child-care responsibilities of working women, but idealized iconographic representations from the Late Helladic mainland and Late Minoan Crete do not show uniform interest in reinforcing this gender role. The art of Late Minoan Crete reveals almost no interest in ideal- izing women as child-care givers; the women of Minoan iconography are almost always depicted outside of domes- tic contexts. Only Mycenaean imagery provides a system- atic, iconographic reinforcement of women's task as child- rearers and suggests a much greater level of investment on the part of Mycenaean society to envision women within the context of the home. Therefore, while both societies place women as child-care givers in daily practice, their iconography suggests that the two cultures may not share identical assumptions regarding the idealization of women primarily within the family structure.</page><page sequence="47">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 377 SESSION VA: GEOMORPHOLOGY, COAST- LINES, AND HARBORS SURVEY OF CLASSICAL HARBORS IN TURKEY: 1996 SURVEY OF APERLAE IN LYCIA: Robert L. Vann and Stephen Sachs, University of Maryland, Robert L. Hohlfelder, University of Colorado, Hugh Elton, Trinity University, and Robert Carter, Seattle Society The objective of the 1996 season was the survey of Ap- erlae in Lycia. The ancient town is best known for its in- undated waterfront, characteristic of the central Lycian coast. Other submerged sites are found several miles east in the region of Kekova. A preliminary publication of the Aperlae by Robert Carter appeared in the IJNA 1978, Clive Foss mentions the site briefly in DOP 1994, and a survey of inscriptions was carried out in recent years but remains unpublished. There are no published measured drawings of Aperlae. For this reason the University of Maryland sur- vey team has expanded its objectives to include a survey of the urban plan and the major buildings within the walls. Hohlfelder conducted the survey of submerged features including a clearly defined jetty, several structures with well-preserved floors, and an apsidal building with floor mosaics. A pattern of streets can be recognized among the substantial remains. The second survey, directed by Elton, recorded cisterns inside and outside the city walls. The third survey, directed by Vann, recorded architectural re- mains of the site. Most visible were the substantially intact city walls including the upper Hellenistic circuit, additions from the Late Roman period, and a small Byzantine cit- adel. Several standing towers to the north and east, two minor postern gates, and two major gates were recorded. Buildings within the walls included a pair of churches and a pair of baths among many more unidentified structures. Cemeteries lay outside the original city walls to the east, north, and west. A particularly nice Doric column mon- ument stood north of the city. There is also a bridge and signal tower west of the city. Sachs directed the surveying team, combining results from the total station and GPS units provided by Trimble. Results of the first season have clearly demonstrated an active and prosperous city dur- ing the Late Roman Empire. SURVEY OF THE HINTERLAND OF SINOP, TURKEY: Fred Hiebert, Harvard University, David Smart, Brown University, Owen Doonan, University of Chicago, and Alex Gantos, Tufts University The Black Sea is well known for its ports and maritime colonies from the period of Greek colonization (700-500 B.C.) onward. Recent excavations and artifact analysis sug- gest the ports around the Black Sea coast form a circum- Pontic culture area distinct from inland regions. The goal of this project is to investigate the origins, chronology, and nature of this interaction area. Sinop has the best natural harbor on the south coast. It is located on a small fertile promontory isolated from the rest of Anatolia by steep mountains that restricted communications to the interior. This season a regional survey documenting the location and date of sites in the immediate hinterland of Sinop was initiated. The survey investigates the relationship of the hinterland to Anatolian and Black Sea cultures. Early Bronze Age, Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman sites were found, for the most part located in small steep valleys oriented toward the sea. Comparatively few sites were documented upland suggesting limited con- tacts with inland Anatolia. The Sinop hinterland flourished primarily during times of known maritime trade (Greek, Hellenistic/Roman, and Byzantine periods). Widespread Early Bronze Age occupation may attest to an earlier period of circum-Pontic interaction. In future seasons a program integrating deep and shallow underwater survey, land sur- vey, and excavation will clarify the relationship of the port and hinterland over time. EVOLUTION OF HOLOCENE EPOCH COASTAL ENVIRON- MENTS AT EPHESOS AND THE ARTEMISION:John C. Kraft, University of Delaware, Ilhan Kayan, Ege University, George Rapp, Jr., University of Min- nesota, Duluth, Helmut Briickner, Marburg Uni- versity, and Ervin Taylor, University of Califor- nia, Riverside Geological mapping of sedimentary environmental litho- somes in the lower Kaystros (Kiiciik Menderes) River flood- plain delta of Anatolia has allowed precise delineation of the shoreline and harbor features of the environs of Ephe- sos over the past 5,000 years. Along with floral and faunal elements and their 14C dates, artifacts, and archaeologi- cally defined structures, geological studies show a continu- ing adaptation of peoples to an everchanging coastal land- scape. As late as 1500 B.C., the southern shoreline of the marine embayment lay across the center of the later site of the Archaic Artemision. A marine reentrant between Ayasuluk and Mt. Koressos (Panayirdag) is a likely location of the earliest sacred harbor. In the Classical period, ma- rine waters remained tight against the northeastern flank of Mt. Koressos. By the first century B.C., however, the pro- grading delta began to bypass Koressos, requiring that any harbor devoted to Artemis was continuously displaced westward. Similarly, we can show that the lower Roman- Byzantine city of Ephesos was built seaward of the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic shoreline, which lay close to the base of Mt. Peion (Builbiildag) and Mt. Koressos. The north- ern mole of the great harbor is comprised of dredged shal- low marine sands and muds and could have been heavily occupied. The longer-term destruction of the harbor of Ephesos was accompanied by anoxic silting and continuous dredging of the harbor entrance and its channel to the sea. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN AN ALLUVIAL DELTA ON THE AEGEAN COAST OF TURKEY: METHODOLOG- ICAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS: Nigel Spencer, In- stitute of Archaeology, Oxford University, and Kyriacos Lambrianides, University College London This paper focuses upon survey work being carried out in the delta of the Madra (ay River on the Aegean coast</page><page sequence="48">378 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 of Turkey (near modern Altinova). From early prehistory, the river's alluvial delta, lying opposite the island of Les- bos, formed a crucial frontier region between the cultures of the Aegean and mainland Anatolia. Almost nothing is known about this part of the coastline archaeologically, however, largely because of the depositional activity of the Madra Cyay River, which has buried many of the cultural deposits and obscured their topographical and environ- mental context. The survey employs an innovative, interdisciplinary ap- proach to the special problems of conducting archaeolog- ical survey work on an alluvial shoreline. In examining the multi-period archaeological sites in the delta (many of which are small tells), a methodology combining collec- tion of surface cultural material (drawn from intensive sur- vey work) with geomorphological augur cores. The latter are of special value in the present context, using the sub- surface stratigraphy to define the extent and environmental context of the sites, which cannot be gauged simply from examining the scatter on the present-day surface. From such cores, we can establish absolute dates for the earliest occupation and formation of the tells, and, through a re- construction of the delta's palaeocoastlines and palaeoen- vironment, shed light upon the reasons for the initial settlement- and later abandonment- of the sites. AN ARTIFICIAL PORT IN MYCENAEAN GREECE: Eber- hard Zangger, Geoarchdiologische Rekonstruk- tionen, Zurich Near the Palace of Nestor in western Messenia, the ear- liest known artificial port in continental Europe was dis- covered and investigated in the framework of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP). In 1992 a rectan- gular alluvial plain, 330 m x 230 m wide, was noticed in a fossil dune environment about 500 m inland of the Io- nian coast. Since this plain appeared to represent a silted- up basin, a number of hand and power drill holes were sunk in 1993 and 1994 to determine the subsurface stratig- raphy. A clay layer up to 6 m thick was found 6 m below the present surface, confirming the initial hypothesis that the plain used to be a basin filled with calm water. Micro- fossil analyses of the drill samples produced several hun- dred marine foraminiferas, thus providing evidence that the pond was filled with seawater. The position of the ba- sin in a dune environment, its rectangular form, flat bot- tom, and steeply sloping walls, and the discovery of arti- facts in the drill samples strongly argue in favor of a cothon-type port. Sedimentological investigations and radiocarbon dates show clearly that the operative phase of the port predated the end of the Bronze Age. While major hydraulic engineering feats have been identified at Tiryns, Gla, Stymphalos, and Tegea, the basin 5 km south- west of the Palace of Nestor is the first artificial port thus far discovered in Mycenaean Greece. ANCIENT HELIKE IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT DISCOV- ERIES: Dora Katsonopoulou, American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and Steven Soter, Smithsonian Institution Helike was the principal city in Achaia from its foun- dation in Mycenaean times until 373 B.C., when it was de- stroyed by an earthquake and submerged in the Gulf of Corinth. Attempts to locate the site between 1950 and 1975 were inconclusive. In 1988 we revived the search, under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies. During the first campaign, we conducted an underwater sonar survey southeast of Aigion and concluded that the ruins of the city should be sought under the coastal plain. From 1991 to 1995, we carried out geophysical surveys and drilled boreholes on land to recover sediment cores. We found ceramic fragments that defined at least two occu- pational horizons concentrated in an area of about 1 km2 between the modern villages of Eliki and Nikolaiika. In 1994 a magnetometry survey of a field (now called the Klonis site) in Eliki revealed structures buried about 2 m deep, which led us to begin excavation of the site in 1995 in cooperation with the local Ephoreia of Antiquities. We uncovered a large building of the Roman period with stand- ing walls 2 m high, as well as a very significant group of potsherds dated to Mycenaean, Protogeometric, and Clas- sical times. These are the first ancient buildings brought to light in the Helike plain, and the Classical potsherds suggest that remains of the lost city may lie below the Ro- man horizon in this area. THE GREEK HARBORS OF THE CORINTHIA: GEOPHYS- ICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Richard M. Rothaus, St. Cloud State University The western harbor of Corinth at Lechaion has never been excavated. Romano has proposed the possibility that the Greek harbor of Lechaion was to the west of the har- bor facilities now extant. Geophysical examinations and AMS radiocarbon dating of lithophagos shells (under the direction of Stathis Stiros) indicate repeated tectonic uplift in this area between 560 and 70 B.C. Several harbor struc- tures were affected by this uplift, and there can be no doubt that this was the location of the Greek harbor. Combined historical and archaeological considerations suggest mul- tiple construction dates with a major phase ca. 600 B.C. The Greek harbor of Kenchreai has never been iden- tified, although topographical considerations dictate that it is at the same location as the well-known Roman harbor. Just as Lechaion has been subject to repeated episodes of tectonic uplift, Kenchreai has suffered multiple inci- dents of subsidence. The tectonic motion seems to be re- lated, and the entire Isthmus is gradually tilting, with Lechaion (on the Corinthian Gulf) "coming out" of the water, and Kenchreai (on the Saronic Gulf) "slipping into"</page><page sequence="49">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 379 the water. Extensive excavation at Kenchreai failed to lo- cate any evidence for the Greek harbor. Scranton proposed that the harbor must have been farther inland and sug- gested a nearby ravine as a likely candidate. Geomorpho- logical considerations weigh against this suggestion. The Greek harbor at Kenchreai is by now submerged. It may now be offshore, or Roman filling operations in the area may have used it as a construction base for the Roman harbor facilities. SESSION VB: ROMAN SCULPTURE ROMAN REALISM: Ellen Perry, University of Evansville Modern scholars have relied upon a handful of passages in Pliny the Elder's Natural History to demonstrate that the Romans judged works of art largely for their "realism," their ability to fool the viewer's eye. There is, however, a more sophisticated strain of art criticism to be found in texts of the Late Republic and Early Empire. An essential ele- ment of that criticism was the concept of diligentia, first identified byJJ. Pollitt. One translation for diligentia might be "attention to detail," and the concept includes, for ex- ample, the minute representation of individual strands of hair and fingernails. On the whole, artists were expected to show an interest in such detail; however, according to many texts a work of art might alsofail because of exces- sive diligentia. The purpose of this paper is to investigate such failures. In Pliny and elsewhere, we read of painters and sculptors who ruined their work through an excessive concern for detail, or because they were more fond of real- ism (similitudo) than they were of beauty (pulchritudo). This attitude toward diligentia finds many parallels in rhetor- ical criticism: a public speech, like a work of art, could fail because of its creator's excessive attention to minutiae. The parallels between art criticism and rhetorical criticism suggest that a rhetorical education inculcated a particular aesthetic in wealthy patrons, and that ancient judgments of art often went far beyond the simple criterion of si- militude to the represented objects. PROBLEMS IN PROVENANCE AND PATRONAGE: A GROUP OF LATE HELLENISTIC STATUETTES FROM PAESTUM: John Griffiths Pedley, University of Michigan A group of damaged marble statuettes (a seated Hermes, an Artemis, three half-draped Aphrodites, two draped Aph- rodites, and a draped female figure) found in the Sanctu- ary of Santa Venera at Paestum in an Italian excavation in the 1950s presents a number of problems. The statuettes are said to have been found in a ruined fountain, the exact location of which is uncertain. Where were they made, who commissioned them, and why? Analysis of type, style, and marble (courtesy of Norman Herz and his team) suggests that they may be dated to the first century B.C., and are adaptations of important Greek types. Examination of comparanda suggests that they were made in Greece (Rhodes and Athens are the most likely places), and exported to Paestum in response to a com- mission similar to those executed by Atticus on Cicerds behalf. Inscriptions from the site reveal that two noblewomen, Sabina and Valeria, were instrumental in the repair and modernization of the sanctuary in the years following 50 B.C. The inscriptions tell us that Sabina rebuilt the temple, and allow the hypothesis that she was also the donor of the fountainhouse. Motivation for the refurbishment of an aging sanctu- ary of Aphrodite/Venus may be found in the social aspira- tions of these two women expressed in emulation of events in Rome: the dedication of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, religious revitalization, assimilation of the heritage of Greece, and visualization of the mythological past. FORGOTTEN WOMEN IN THE IMPERIAL PORTRAIT GROUP FROM BI~ZIERS: Susan Wood, Oakland University A group of marble portrait heads from the ruins of a building near the forum of Beziers includes five identifiable likenesses ofJulio-Claudians, and three that are problem- atic. The identities of the latter portraits may cast light both on Tiberian dynastic politics and on the roles of elite women, in the imperial family and in local aristocracies. This assemblage took shape over many years, as chang- ing political situations required local patrons to alter the group's contents. The recutting of the head of Augustus for a new format, and other technical details indicate an Augustan date for some heads, while others must be Ti- berian. The years following the death of Germanicus were crucial in dynastic propaganda: Drusus Minor had emerged as the clearest heir to power, while his twin sons offered hope for the continuation of the line of Tiberius. Two of the female portraits were probably added to the group at this time to celebrate the distinguished bloodlines of Dru- sus: that ofLivia, an identification generally accepted, and one of the more problematic female portraits, which I be- lieve represents his mother, Vipsania Agrippina, the first wife of Tiberius. This head resembles the portraits both of her son Drusus and of her father, Agrippa, that were part of the original B~ziers group. The other problematic female does not match any es- tablished Julio-Claudian type, despite efforts to identify it as Antonia Minor. It probably instead represents a local citizen, and thus provides early evidence of the public prom- inence of women in such local aristocracies.</page><page sequence="50">380 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 DIVERSITY IN HAIR AND PORTRAIT STYLES OF JULIO- CLAUDIAN WOMEN: Nancy L. Thompson, Metro- politan Museum of Art One of the ways in which scholars date the portraits of private Roman citizens is to compare the hairstyle and portrait style with the prevailing standards adopted by mem- bers of the imperial court. Portraits of women from the Flavian period, for example, can be identified as such be- cause their hairstyles are duplications of the distinctive curl-coiffure worn by Julia Titi. This system of dating pri- vate female portraits by reference is generally quite reli- able after the mid-first century A.D. In the earlier Augus- tan andJulio-Claudian periods, however, this faithfulness of private images to imperial models was not yet pro- nounced. The portraits of private women from this period show a much greater diversity of hairstyle, and of the han- dling of facial features, than is exhibited in the portraits of imperial women. For example, the empress Livia wore only a few circumscribed variants of her trademark nodus coiffure. In the realm of private portraiture, however, the range of variations on the nodus is much greater. What accounts for this variation? In this paper I argue that Julio-Claudian private women were depicted with wildly varying hairstyles as a continuation of the freedom of hairstyles that was common in the Late Republican period. It was only as the imperial portrait system consol- idated its hold by mid-century that the portraits of women began to reflect more uniformly the types of hairstyles worn by the women of the imperial court. A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE HERAKLES RELIEF AT DELPHI: Robert G.A. Weir, Princeton University In the Archaeological Museum at Delphi is a marble relief illustrating several of the Labors of Herakles in six fragmentary panels, which had a total length of about 8.25 m. The relief's poor preservation and mediocre workman- ship have failed to generate much scholarship beyond an inconclusive debate over its date between L6veque (BCH 75 [1951] 247-63) and Sturgeon (AJA 82 [1978] 226-35). I attempt to demonstrate that the relief is Neronian and probably dates to shortly before Nero's participation in the Pythian Games of A.D. 67 at Delphi. The provenance of the relief fragments and their inscribed setting marks leave no doubt that they adorned the front of a low pul- pitum constructed in the Delphi theater in Roman times. A Tiberian inscription reused in the orchestra paving and Domitianic inscriptions on certain ornamental columns furnish termini post quem and ante quem for this reno- vation. In addition, the hairstyle of the best-preserved Her- akles head is iconographically closest to portraits of Nero, not Classical prototypes nor other Imperial heads. Since a number of the events in which Nero participated were held in this theater, his advent is thus the most plausible occasion for the relief's creation. Furthermore, it is well known that Nero entertained a Heraklean conceit, as Sue- tonius, Cassius Dio, and contemporary coins of Patrai at- test. Nero's subsequent gift of 100,000 denarii to Delphi is indication that the shrewd flattery of its administrators paid off. THE CORINTH THEATER SCULPTURES: SELF- PRESENTATION OF THE ROMAN CITY: Mary C. Stur- geon, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill New investigation of the Roman sculptures from the early excavations of the Theater at Corinth makes possible their reconstruction on the theater's elaborate, colonnaded, three-story facade from the second century A.D. Architec- tural and freestanding sculptures form a sculptural com- plex directly related to the theater's political, religious, and cultural functions. Previously published reliefs with Gigantomachy, Ama- zonomachy, and Herakles scenes, restored on the socles across the three stories in M. Sturgeon, Corinth IX.2 (Prince- ton 1977), are supplemented by pairs of silenoi as archi- tectural support figures flanking the central, second-story niche. Large relief heads of Triton and Aphrodite or Thetis occupy podia over the side entrances, and busts of Helios and Demeter project from side pediments of the second story. A colossal image of the emperor, very likely a post- humous Trajan, stood in the central niche, possibly flanked by imperial portraits on the sides. Political figures on the facade have counterparts else- where in the theater, accompanied by statues represent- ing key Corinthian deities and symbols of culture, drama, and education. Altars, a gilt imago, a stele with prizes, and a victor statue's base give witness to the religious proces- sions, contests, and celebrations featured in this theater. The battle and Herakles scenes present exempla virtutis. The sculptures on the theater facade glorify Corinth's Greek heritage and her position in the Roman Imperial world as the prosperous capital of the province of Achaea, pro- viding an appropriate setting for the religious, political, and dramatic spectacles that inscriptions and literary sources indicate were featured on this stage. OBSERVATIONS ON THE BERLIN PORTRAIT OF THE HA- DRIANIC TONDI:Julia Lenaghan, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University A head in Berlin that was removed from a figure of the Hadrianic tondi represents a portrait type already known in two other full-scale reproductions, one in Naples and one in St. Petersburg, both originally from Rome. The small- scale portrait from the tondi and the two fine marble busts share enough distinguishing details of hair and face that they must be based on the same model. The portrait in the Farnese Collection in Naples and the portrait in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg have already been recognized as replicas of a common portrait type and dated by the technical handling of the eyes to the Early Antonine period. Furthermore, they are preserved with their original busts, which, though not identical, are large and cuirassed. The Farnese bust even wears the fringed paludamentum, which appears to have been first worn by Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. Because the portrait exists in two copies and because both sit on prestigious bust types, the man represented must have been a notable of high rank during the Early Antonine period. That the Berlin head of the Hadrianic tondi seems to</page><page sequence="51">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 381 be a version of the same portrait type as these two busts reintroduces discussion about the portraiture of the tondi. It is clear that some accepted views about the tondi and who is represented in them need to be modified. EARRINGS OR BREAD-RINGS? A GALLO-ROMAN FU- NERARY RELIEF FROM METZ: Alexis Young, McMaster University Depictions of a thriving small-scale economy in Roman Gaul during the second and third centuries A.D. are found on a series of funerary reliefs with vending scenes. The Gallo-Roman reliefs portray the merchants engaged in sell- ing a variety of commodities, such as garments, perfume, wine, fruits, vegetables, and cuts of meat. Like the mer- chants on the well-known shop reliefs from Ostia, the Gallo- Roman vendors had a predilection for proudly displaying themselves in their occupational roles on their funerary monuments. In this paper I examine the iconography of one vending relief, found in 1822, at Metz (Divodurum) in northeast- ern France. Prior interpretations of the enigmatic wares being displayed for sale include either breads and pastries, or jewelry. My research, aided by depictions of objects on wallpaintings and sculptured reliefs, supports the inter- pretation that the Metz relief portrays the sale of jewelry. I also argue that some of the objects portrayed on the re- lief represent ornaments made of glass. Thus, this scene on the Metz relief very likely depicts the only known ex- ample in Roman Gaul of a jewelry vendor in his shop. SCULPTURES FROM THE SANCTUARY OF PAN AT CAE- SAREA PHILIPPI (ISRAEL): THE IMPORT OF MARBLE STATUARY TO THE LEVANT: Elise A. Friedland, Uni- versity of Michigan This paper presents over 200 fragments of marble sculp- tures discovered in the recent excavations at the Sanctu- ary of Pan at Caesarea Philippi/Banias. The sanctuary, which centered around a natural grotto in Hellenistic times, de- veloped in the Roman period into a prominent and archi- tecturally elaborated cult site dedicated to multiple Graeco- Roman deities. The sculptures from Caesarea Philippi represent ideal subjects and range in date up to the fourth century A.D. They include an Athena, Dionysos, Capitoline Aphrodite, and nymph (all life-sized), a near-life-sized Artemis Ros- pigliosi, and a miniature Herakles Farnese and Borghese Faun. Although there is no native source of marble in the Levant, these sculptures and similar examples from Beth Shean and Caesarea Maritima suggest that marble stat- uary was commonly imported to this region. Isotopic anal- yses of the marble, technical features such as neck struts, and stylistic characteristics suggest that the Caesarea Phi- lippi sculptures originated in Caria in southwest Asia. They probably entered the Levant through the port city of Tyre, which is thought to have had marble yards and receiving agencies. The abundance of imported statuary found at Caesarea Philippi testifies to the sanctuary's status both locally and regionally. The group's chronological range indicates that the sanctuary continued to receive pagan dedications con- current with Christian activity in the city. Finally, the continued discovery of large and varied sculptural groups in a region where there is no native source of marble at- tests to Levantine participation in the broader Imperial marble trade. SESSION VC: AIA PRESIDENTIAL COLLO- QUIUM: HOUSE AND STATUS IN THE AN- CIENT CITY ON EQUALITY OF LOT DIVISION AT MEGARA HYBLAIA IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.: Henri Treziny, Uni- versite de Provence According to the publication of Megara Hyblaea 1. Le quar- tier de lAgora archaique, the insulae of Megara Hyblaea are divided into lots whose dimensions vary from 110 to 140 m2. A more detailed study of these divisions, which cer- tainly go back to the foundation of the city in the second half of the eighth century, shows that some blocks (to the west of the Agora) are regularly divided into lots of 120 m2, while others to the east of the Agora are divided into lots of ca. 135 m2- other dimensions being accidental vari- ations. It appears that these lot sizes can be expressed in modules (9 x 7 in the first case, 9 x 8 in the second). It may be that this difference is explainable by a con- struction error, and by a subsequent attempt (itself mis- taken) to correct the initial error. In this case, the system of lot division at Megara Hyblaia would have aimed at the creation of equal lots, and the inequalities noted above would be accidental. Yet this hypothesis entails certain difficulties when one attempts to envisage the method of actually laying out the city plan. It is true that the inverse hypothesis, according to which the lots were in effect intentionally unequal, poses quite different problems concerning the basic nature of the colonial movement. A seriously considered response to these questions can doubtlessly be made only in the context of the general reexamination of the urban plan of Megara that is now underway. HOUSES OF MODULAR PLAN AT SELINOUS IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C.: Dieter Mertens, Deutsches Archiologisches Institut, Rome In drawing up a new detailed plan of the "acropolis" at Selinous, particular attention has been drawn to nu- merous walls constructed of large ashlar blocks, in some cases preserved to a height of ca. 5 m where they are en- compassed in the Hermokratean fortifications (late fifth century). The ashlar walls are found within the insulae reoccupied in the period of Punic occupation at Selinous in the second half of the fourth century B.C. Datable to</page><page sequence="52">382 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 the first half of the fifth century according to all available evidence, these walls can be shown-despite their ambi- tious technique- to belong to houses. This is clear from the fact that the houses, whose sides are defined by cor- ners, are arranged in regular rows with consistent dimen- sions of ca. 14.5 x 14.5 m. It is important to note that these are uniformly common walls, constructed in a single row of blocks with a thickness of ca. 0.55 m, and that most of the insulae of the central area of the "acropolis," on both sides of the principal north-south street, seem to have been constructed in a single great building campaign according to a predetermined plan. UNEQUAL BLOCK DIVISION IN ORTHOGONAL PLAN- NING: Malcolm Bell, III, University of Virginia This paper examines the practice of unequal lot divi- sion, using evidence from Sicilian Naxos, Morgantina, and Carthage. Inequality of lot size is shown to reflect political and/or socioeconomic conditions. The second city plan of Naxos (fifth century B.C., replacing the eighth-century plan, either immediately post-476 or post-461) is charac- terized by the initial division of blocks into modular lots of widely varying size. It is argued that the plan is owed to the Dorian colonists settled at Naxos after 476 B.C. by Hieron of Syracuse, and that it reflects the political struc- ture of a city under tyrannical rule. The third-century houses of Morgantina respect the ear- lier city plan but differ widely in size and are not modular; they reflect instead the oligarchic/bourgeois society char- acteristic of a Hellenistic kingdom. The Hannibalic quarter at Carthage on the Byrsa hill was laid out early in the second century B.C.; block divi- sion closely recalls the unequal lots of Sicilian Naxos, but here the lots of varying size and use reflect the mercantile values and hierarchical structure of Carthaginian society.

THE BUILDINGS ON THE FORUM OF COSA: Elizabeth Fentress, American Academy in Rome The excavations of 1993 and 1995 have provided us with an almost complete plan of atrium building V and require us to rethink earlier hypotheses about its nature and use. The new plan strikingly resembles that of the late third- and second-century patrician houses we find at Pompeii and other sites. In light of this information, we must care- fully reexamine EE. Brown's suggestion that the buildings were public spaces, or atria publica. The relationship between the atrium houses on the fo- rum and the houses elsewhere in the city is examined. The street frontage of atrium building V measures 17.5 m,just over double the width of the house plots into which the insulae excavated by R.T. Scott and V. Bruno were divided. This can hardly be a coincidence, for it was not uncom- mon for the equites of a colony to receive a double allot- ment of land outside the walls. It is even more striking that the dimensions fit very closely to those prescribed in the first-century lex municipii Tarentini, where the town houses of the decurions had to be covered by 1,500 tegulae, evidently used in this context as a measurement of area. Calculations show that this would be almost identical to the size of the Cosan building. What we find at Cosa must be the standard type of the house of the equites of a col- ony. By induction, we must suggest that the smaller houses are those of the ordinary colonists with clear parallels at Pompeii and elsewhere. SESSION VD: COLLOQUIUM: "CULT" STAT- UES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD OH, STATUE, SPEAK! DIVINE AND ROYAL IMAGES IN ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA: Karen L. Wilson, Univer- sity of Chicago This paper explores the ways in which Mesopotamian cult was centered on the statue and took the form of pro- viding the services that statue required to animate and to maintain it and to enable it to function within com- munities that were both human and divine. In ancient Mesopotamia, sculptural images were the fo- cus of complex rituals that transformed them into living manifestations of the divinity or ruler they represented. The verb used for making statues was not that used for making other cult paraphernalia, but was one that desig- nated birth. The image, created in a special workshop, underwent an elaborate and highly secret ritual of con- secration that transformed it into a receptacle for the di- vine or royal presence. These rituals endowed it with "life" and "opened" its eyes and mouth so that it could see, speak, and eat. Once animated and ritually installed in the temple, both divine and royal statues lived in an elaborate ritual con- text of attendance to their every perceived need. They were nourished with regular meals, and carried in solemn pro- cession during festivals; they visited other sanctuaries on special occasions, and, in turn, received the visits of lesser gods and the prayers of supplicants. These images and the cults that centered around their care and feeding served</page><page sequence="53">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 383 as the heart of a system of religious and political beliefs and relationships that were central to the functioning of the entire Mesopotamian state. THE NATURE OF EGYPTIAN CULT IMAGES: Edna R. Russ- mann, The Brooklyn Museum At least as early as the beginning of the Old Kingdom, Egyptians made a distinction between two- and three- dimensional representations and the individuals they por- trayed. Thus cult images functioned as the objects of cult practices, for which purpose they were magically animated by the spirit or soul of the beneficiary (who might be a private person, as well as a king or deity). Throughout the pharaonic period, however, there is ample evidence to show that this rather sophisticated understanding of cult im- agery was not shared by the general populace, whose ten- dency to identify an image with its subject contributed to a New Kingdom phenomenon: images of kings or gods that were the subjects of their own cults. A STATUE FOR THE DEITY: CULT IMAGES IN HITTITE ANATOLIA: BillieJean Collins, Emory University In the state religion of the Hittites, the cult statue was the central focus of the temple building, and the main pre- occupation of its staff and personnel. Worship of the gods of the official pantheon of the Hittites focused on these divine images. This paper reviews the cultic activities that surrounded divine images in the city temples, and exam- ines the relationship of the worshiper to the divine image and that of the image to the divinity it represents. Hittite cult statues can be defined roughly as statues that received offerings. This definition, however, encom- passes not only the images of divinities housed in the temples, but also statues of the dead, specifically of de- ceased kings, who became gods after death and received offerings befitting a deity. The Hittites did not distinguish between images of kings and gods in their language. In- deed, all statues, regardless of form or function, were called esri (Sumerian = ALAM). Thus, this definition of the cult statue, although useful for the modern researcher, may not be a viable category in Hittite thought. Since the worship of gods in Hittite Anatolia was not restricted to the temple, and, in fact, open-air sanctuaries in sacred locations were common throughout Anatolia and undoubtedly predate the institution of the temple by many hundreds of years, this paper also explores possible moti- vations for the creation of cult statues in the first place. In other words, what did the cult statue in its temple offer that open-air sanctuaries did not? THE GREEK IMAGES OF THE GODS: A.A. Donohue, Bryn Mawr College Gods dominate the visual arts of ancient Greece at every level from the sanctuaries provided for their worship to the paintings, statues, and other arts that illustrate their stories. In modern scholarship, so-called cult images are distinguished from the ordinary run of representations of the gods. Cult images are thought to be a special class, unique in origin and development, in which artistic con- cerns intersect with demands of religion. Yet although the concept is virtually axiomatic in classical scholarship, it finds surprisingly little support in either the material or the literary evidence for Greek representations of divinities. In modern scholarship, three criteria define the cate- gory of cult image: 1) terminology; 2) purpose, placement, and practice; and 3) appearance. Information about cult images is eagerly sought among the literary and physical remains of Greek civilization, and any artistic material that can be tied to them is assigned special significance. The validity of the category, however, is open to doubt. The Greek evidence does not support the criteria by which the group is defined, but suggests instead that the idea is a construct that has served to limit appreciation of the nature and extent of Greek practice regarding images of the gods. The critique of cult images raises the questions of how so unsatisfactory a concept arose and what interpretation should take its place. The first can be answered through historiographic analysis; the second requires a broad re- evaluation of the evidence for Greek representations of the gods. STATUES WITH HEARTS: Sarolta A. Takacs, Harvard University Roman religion was an open system governed by rit- uals. The aftermath of the Second Punic War not only endowed Rome with hegemonial power over the Mediter- ranean but also induced a redefinition of Rome's under- standing of its cultural self in light of Greek achievements. In the process of cultural acquisition and redefinition for- eign statues found their way to Rome. Did these statues retain, lose, or perhaps gain religious importance once they left their original place? How did Roman religious ideology deal with shifts between the sacred and the pro- fane in such statues? Was there a ritual Romans could em- ploy when they replaced their own ancient terracotta or wooden statues with those of other materials? Did Ro- mans worship such statues as divine likenesses sharing space and time with mortals? Did they somehow believe, as a Lucilian fragment suggests, that bronze statues had hearts? The purpose of this paper is to explore these questions as well as the Roman understanding of "cult" statues be- yond the conjecture that they were revered in Greek fash- ion. Romans, as Varro noted, originally worshipped gods without images. Since the Latin language provides several words for statue (effigies, imago, signum, simulacrum, statua), an analysis of these synonyms is warranted. Their specific meanings and shadings need to be established, for refined semantic understanding will help reveal Roman percep- tion of "cult" statues, which, if Varro is to be believed, be- came a prominent feature of Roman religion.</page><page sequence="54">384 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 SESSION VE: COLLOQUIUM: CRITICAL IS- SUES FOR THE INTERNET: DISCUSSION LISTS AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB CRITICAL ISSUES FOR CLASSICS ON THE INTERNET:John G. Younger, Duke University While the Internet may be new to the humanities, it is clear that students of antiquity are among its most inno- vative users. Classicists have long coped with foreign scripts, illustrations of material culture, and new theories and tech- niques. The Internet seems to present a unique solution to all three problems: in discussion lists we can carry on lively and immediate discussions about the relevance of the past, and on the World Wide Web we can display text and image together as publications and as teaching materials. The democratic nature of the Internet also presents crit- ical problems. Anyone can use the Internet, participate in discussion lists, and publish Web sites. E-mail discus- sions resemble printed conversations: random thoughts, rumor, misinformation, and passion abound. The ease of writing messages and replying to them often leads to care- lessness and misunderstanding; correspondents need to exercise caution, restraint, and tolerance. Web sites and publications vary greatly in quality. Own- ers often do not maintain their Web sites or keep them up-to-date; reputable archives and site references are still haphazard. Readers of Web sites need to be wary of their use. Nevertheless, the users of the Internet are beginning to think collectively; list owners constantly discuss list pol- icy, ethics, and etiquette; site managers map out areas of responsibility and avoid overlap; and editors of journals and magazines devote much space to reviewing Web sites and discussion lists. A new form of communication is emerg- ing, and it needs all participants to act responsibly in its development. TOWARD A WIDER WORLD FOR SCHOLARLY ARCHAEOL- OGY: Pedar W Foss, University of Cincinnati The information revolution is not only changing the way scholars work, it has created a new medium for public outreach. Professionals should consider how to use this inexpensive technology to expand and inform our client base of laypersons, schoolteachers, and students. There are three types of Web home pages that scholars should consider establishing: Web sites that present basic academic or institutional information, teaching materials, and cur- rent research. An academic Web site can present mission statements, personnel contact information, course information such as schedules, public lectures, and educational outreach pro- grams. The Web site should make the user feel comfort- able with its accessibility, being sufficiently organized and detailed to guide the user to proper sources of information. Teaching materials, syllabi and bibliographies, and schedules of academic lectures can all be valuable instruc- tive resources. Their primary purpose should be to pre- sent a gateway for users searching for information. Links to other Internet resources need to be plentiful. Current research or fieldwork can be published in pre- liminary form, accompanied by supplements that update the work. Opportunities for volunteers may also be posted. Summaries of discussions among scholars and the public can enhance participation, through e-mail groups, Web sites, or even virtual conferences. The public appetite for information is tremendous, and by filling that need we can also build a more responsive audience for the classics. THE INTERNET'S BROAD BASE OF CLIENTS: Linda Wright and Mary Whitlock Blundell, University of Washington Electronic discussion lists are now indispensable for providing an efficient means of communication among researchers separated by great distances. Every day new subscribers who are unfamiliar with the technology or in- experienced in the discipline (or both)join these lists. How can lists best serve the needs of such a broad base of clients, as well as cope with continual technological changes? What role does a list owner perform and what expectations should the subscriber have? A list owner must recognize and overcome both tech- nological and sociological problems with on-line commu- nication even in academic communities. In order to make the most of electronic discussion groups, our responsibil- ity must be to oversee administrative matters and provide guidance, while subscribers need to follow rules of "net- iquette" and respect minimum guidelines for contributions. The list owner also needs to be courteous and efficient when assisting members, while ill-considered postings from subscribers may require gentle arbitration. Besides distributing information quickly and widely, e- mail lists provide new meeting places for scholars who can become known earlier in their careers and acquainted with far more colleagues than they would meet at most confer- ences. Classicists benefit from the strengthened mutual support, and camaraderie has burgeoned. Such goals require cooperation between members and list owners, which will provide scholars with the opportu- nity to direct the future of their profession and of elec- tronic academic communication. USING THE INTERNET FOR TEACHING:JOhn Muccigrosso, University of Michigan Computers have become standard academic tools in teaching, but there are difficulties in making effective use of them. Problems that all disciplines have encountered include getting courseware (course materials available over the Internet) to run on the many different types of oper- ating systems that are in common use, making courseware accessible to students wherever and whenever they need it, making it easy for instructors to update their materials, and providing as much interactivity as possible to enhance the pedagogical value of the software.</page><page sequence="55">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 385 For courses in the classics there are special difficulties. The need to use multiple fonts is the most obvious one. But integrating archaeological images along with text, and bi- lingual texts at that, uses much valuable file space and can slow down the accessibility of the course materials. The World Wide Web solves many of these problems, but also creates new ones. The enhanced power of the Web requires specialized knowledge and software. We have, there- fore, begun to rely more and more on university "Offices of Information Technology" and state-of-the-art comput- ers; all of this costs money. Software that is easy to use and that will take advantage of new Internet capabilities is slowly arriving, and when it does, it will simplify the task of setting up courseware so that instructors can continue to do what they are sup- posed to do- teach the most recent advances in our dis- cipline effectively. PUBLISHING ON THE INTERNET: Sebastian ES. Heath, University of Michigan Many academic papers are now available via FTP, Go- pher, and the World Wide Web. These range from com- plete syllabi, such asJeremy Rutter's course in the Aegean Bronze Age, to small studies, such as Greg Reeder's dis- cussion of gender issues in ancient Egypt. Most of these studies are offered by individuals on their own file space granted them by their universities or pur- chased from private servers. Search engines can find titles like "The History of the Domesticated Horse" and "Ancient Plumbing," but the modern researcher must approach all sites with caution, since they vary greatly in quality. A few papers are offered by institutions. The Bryn Mawr Classical and Medieval Reviews, for instance, provide crit- ical reviews of books to e-mail subscribers. Nestor's bibli- ographies are available via FTP for databases or spread- sheets, allowing for easy keyword searching. Mainly because it is new, Internet publishing seems tem- porary and uncertain. One of its major attractions, how- ever, is the capacity for upgrades and enhancement. A Web site is not like a book: its information can be modified at will. The ability to be updated continually is particu- larly appropriate for the publication of bibliographies, catalogues, and ongoing discussions. As more journals es- tablish WWW sites for evolving information, more schol- ars will be able to claim from their academic institutions the credit they deserve for such publishing. ISSUES OF STORAGE, RETRIEVAL, AND PERMANENCE OF INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET: Harrison Eiteljorg, II, Center for the Study of Architecture To be used by scholars, electronic data must be as ac- curate, as safe, as permanent, and as available as standard library sources. However, electronic data, generally speak- ing, are assumed to be subject to tampering, short-lived, and potentially impossible to locate. To remedy this situ- ation, all electronic data of significance must be archived safely-with redundant storage and appropriate safeguards for renewing data- to prevent loss and tampering. Since data files in a given computer format may not be useful in one, five, or 10 years and will almost certainly be useless in 25 years, they must be protected from obsolescence. They can be protected by pursuing an active archival strategy of migrating data files to new formats as required. Poten- tial users of files must know how to find them, and those users must have confidence that they will be able to find data at any time in the future - most securely in an archive. Impediments to archival storage are many. Scholars are reluctant to permit others to control their data; the data are often thought to change more or less continuously; money to prepare files for archival storage is scarce; re- wards for archival work are virtually nonexistent and may, in fact, be negative if one considers the time that might have been spent on other work. Removing the impedi- ments will require changes in approaches to scholarship and to colleagues. Those changes will take time, but our ability to use electronic data effectively depends on them. SESSION VIB: REVIVALS AND REWORKINGS: ANTIQUARIANS AND THE LATE ANTIQUE ANCIENT ANTIQUARIANS: REVIVALS IN BABYLONIA: Erica Ehrenberg, National Gallery of Art Despite the displacements that shaped Mesopotamian political destiny, a historical consciousness permeated its intellectual climate and allowed certain cultural concep- tions to find common expression over many millennia. Con- servatism manifests itself in physical remains that emulate or appropriate features of ancient prototypes. Babylonia in the first half of the sixth century B.C. pos- sessed an unabashedly antiquarian spirit, witnessed in ar- chaizing texts and in inscriptions recording royal unearth- ings of ancient temple foundations. The idiosyncratic ardor for such excavations revealed in the inscriptions of King Nabonidus has even earned him the modern label of ama- teur archaeologist. Whether archaeological zeal or cultic precedent motivated the search for antiquities, the attrac- tion to the past is unmistakable. As a result of the dearth of monumental representational works, investigations into revivalism in sixth-century Baby- lonia have not encompassed visual imagery. This paper fills the gap through the examination of stamp and cylinder seal impressions on tablets from the Ishtar temple archive at Uruk. Numerous impressions in nondistinctive contexts display iconography popular in the earlier first millennium, suggesting that they were created not by venerated ancient seals but by newly minted ones resuscitating ancient mo- tifs. Further, the percentage of such impressions within the corpus peaks in the time of Nabonidus, perhaps in accordance with that king's pronounced proclivity toward the archaic. The evidence of the seal impressions thus cor- roborates that of the texts and distinguishes the sixth- century Babylonians as avid commemorators of their an- cient heritage.</page><page sequence="56">386 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHODS OF PARE DELATTRE AT CARTHAGE: Joann Freed, Wilfred Laurier University In November 1875, Alfred-Louis Delattre, a member of the Order of White Fathers founded by Charles Lavigerie, then Archbishop of Algiers, came to Carthage as priest to the chapel of Saint-Louis, a bit of French Catholic soil in Tunisia. Delattre was 25, intelligent, and knew Greek and Latin. Lavigerie saw him as ideal for the intended post of priest, medical doctor, and archaeologist. Lavigerie had been reared in a rationalist home and his White Fathers combined religious devotion with learning. Delattre was therefore self-taught as an archaeologist. On the advice of Lavigerie, he soon began to publish his work in scholarly journals. He also published regularly in the French science journal Cosmos and in Missions catho- liques. He quickly formed a network of scholarly acquain- tances, among them Cagnat and Heron de Villefosse. For 50 years he dug at Carthage, filling his museum with Punic, Roman, and Early Christian finds. He supported the work through donations and by selling offprints of his publications. Delattre covered an unimaginable amount of ground and destroyed many of the city's sites. At the same time, he worked diligently to record his excavations and left thou- sands of objects in the present Musee national de Carthage to be studied by a later generation. In this paper, I present his excavations and methods, using the evidence of his ca. 325 articles and books. REASSESSING THE LATE ANTIQUE SHRINE OF LIBER PATER AT CosA:Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton, Cornell University Recent excavations in the forum at Cosa conducted by E. Fentress under the aegis of the American Academy in Rome have altered previous dating for the later Imperial phases of its building history (JRA 7 [1994] 208-22). This affects the circumstances surrounding the Late Antique shrine of Liber Pater, excavated in 1968. These excavations show that the space where the shrine was eventually in- stalled was constructed during the third century A.D. re- settlement of the town, later than previously thought. By 300 the inhabitants had left, and the Bacchic worshippers equipped that space to house their sacred furnishings and provide for their gatherings a place both private and se- cure at a time increasingly hostile to pagan worship. The late date, the wealth of Bacchic cult material found within, and the interior layout yield an archaeological doc- ument unique in the history of the Bacchic cult. A fresh analysis of the interior shows it as an ad hoc design pro- viding for the association's religious and social functions. It features an altar before an enshrined cult image for re- ligious ceremonies, a masonry dining couch and adjoin- ing alcove for dining and drinking, and a sacristy for stor- ing the ceramic drinking service and wine vessels. Such arrangements fulfilling dual purposes were common among private cults in Roman times and derive in part from the domestic ambience. THE LIVERPOOL IVORIES AND LATE ANTIQUE SCULP- TURES: KimJ. Hartswick, George Washington Uni- versity Two ivory plaques, known since the 18th century, are now in the Liverpool Museum. Presumably paired diptych leaves, one represents the healing deity Asklepios, and the other his daughter, Hygieia. Although the identifications are certain, iconographic peculiarities have led scholars to declare these ivories Renaissance in date, while others have explained the apparent discrepancies as early fifth- century misunderstandings. Autopsy of the ivories in Liver- pool has revealed hitherto unrecognized details that may be relevant to a better understanding of not only the possible sources of these figures, but of their broader sig- nificance with regard to Late Antique image making. Several of the most striking features include Asklepios leaning on a club that rests on a bucranium, and Hygieia appearing as Venus (with bared shoulder and her com- panion, Eros) beside an Apolline tripod. To be sure, such combinations of features do not conform with pagan images of these healing gods, but they are not so removed from ancient sources to disavow their antiquity. Both Asklepios and Hygieia appear to stand on bases, suggesting a sculptural prototype for each. G. Becatti (ArchC1 25 [1973] 18-53) believes the relief figures echo statues of Asklepios and Hygieia that were known to be in the Temple of Concord in the Roman Forum; yet these may not be the only possible sources. Indeed, Becatti must ac- count for the peculiar iconographic details as a result of the translation of three-dimensional bronze images into two-dimensional ivory ones, and as a deliberate manip- ulation and combination of motifs that the prototypes surely never possessed. The club and bull's head with Asklepios, a unique fea- ture of this ivory, appear to be the result of a Late Roman attitude revering Hercules as a healing deity, attested by inscriptions, particularly in the provinces, and popular- ized by the army. But there was not only a provincial as- sociation of these deities because a similar, and more di- rect, one is found in Rome. Pirro Ligorio recorded in the 16th century a semicircular nymphaeum (probably of Dio-, cletianic date) in the garden-stadium on the Palatine that housed images of Asklepios, Hygieia, and Hercules. And, because the ivories are thought to have been manufactured in Rome, this imperial grouping is enticing as a possible reason for the conflation of attributes during this transi- tional period between the pagan and Christian worlds. RENOVATIO ROMAE: SPOLIA AND IDEOLOGY IN NINTH- CENTURY ROME: Barbara McLauchlin, San Fran- cisco State University The physical reuse of classical antiquity throughout the Mediterranean often appears haphazard, even whimsical. At certain times, however, an apparently careful selection and display of antiquity's remains suggest a conscious pro- gram of historical appropriation. The early ninth-century church dedicated to St. Prassede by Pope Pascal I is justly famous for its mosaics; but all of the elements of the build-</page><page sequence="57">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 387 ing, including the plan, elevation, and building materials themselves reflect a process of decision making, leading to the way the building was intended to be "read" in re- lation to its purpose and to that of the pope who com- missioned its construction. This paper relegates the well- published mosaics to the background and concentrates on the ways in which the overall plan of the church and building materials, in particular the spolia from many ear- lier buildings, are connected to the image of Pascal I as a "restorer." Choice architectural spolia from at least 20 Late Republican to Late Imperial structures, including frag- ments of three monumental inscriptions, furnished ma- terials used in construction and decoration. Not only did Pascal I contribute to the physical renovatio Romae, he seems to have resurrected a Constantinian model, of which the spolia are an important but overlooked element. THE BYZANTINE SETTLEMENT IN THE ISTHMIAN FOR- TRESS: EVIDENCE OF CHANGE FROM A MILITARY TO AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY: Joan Marguerite Downs, University of Michigan In this paper I examine the settlement around the West Gate, the only gate into the Byzantine fortress at Isthmia from the 12th through 14th centuries. The features of the perimeter wall of the fortress were excavated in the 1960s but much of the context material was left unanalyzed. My study of these finds and their placement illustrates that this major Byzantine military settlement experienced growth associated with periods of both military threat and security. The position of the settlement within the fortress shifted over time. This movement is illustrated by the closing of the two original Late Antique monumental gates through the enceinte and the construction of a much smaller and more defensible portal on the fortress's west side. My re- search suggests that the gate's position was determined both by strategic concerns and by the still important topographic logic of the Roman remains of the Isthmian sanctuary. In addition, the community that formed around this gate and the chronology of its development illustrate in microcosm the kinds of changes the site experienced as it moved back and forth over time from a military facility to an agricul- tural community. The area around the West Gate is rich in architectural remains and small finds. The arrangement of these ma- terials shows how this strategic site's functions were manipu- lated by practical and historical influences. Isthmia's demo- graphic patterns illustrate the ongoing vitality of the site in its guise as a fortress or an agricultural community. RECONSTRUCTING POLYCHROMY ON MIDDLE BYZAN- TINE ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE: Eric A. Ivison, Amorium Excavation Project, and Elizabeth Hen- drix, New York University New techniques of photography under ultraviolet light, which can reveal painting invisible to the unaided eye, have greatly enhanced our understanding of polychromy on an- cient sculpture. Architectural sculpture of the Middle Byz- antine period (800-1204) was also painted, but few painted pieces survive in situ or in museums. Consequently, our knowledge of such polychromy in Byzantine church dec- oration is poor, despite the fact that painted stone fittings and furnishings occupied prominent locations. Excavations in a major church in Amorium- an important city of the Middle Byzantine period- have, however, unearthed a large corpus of architectural sculpture that still preserves in part its medieval polychromy. We present the results of a study of these sculptures made during the 1996 campaign at Amorium, combining close examination with new photographic techniques. Meth- ods include ultraviolet florescence and reflectance photog- raphy, as well as raking light photography and visual ex- amination under low magnification, to provide sets of data that together can be used to reconstruct the polychromy. We also examine the pigments and painting methods used on the stones. In evaluating the importance of these results, we con- sider the original setting and function of these painted sculptures to determine their contribution, if any, to an overall decorative program. Equipment and safety pre- cautions for these photographic techniques are also dis- cussed. Our paper therefore offers not only new insights on medieval art, but also new analytical methods for field archaeologists. ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE SULTANATE OF OMAN: THE SAMAD PROJECT 1981-1996: Paul Yule, University of Heidelberg The work of the German Archaeological Mission began in 1977 to shed light on the site of Magan. In 1980 in the interior of central Oman, Weisgerber discovered a grave containing an unknown kind of handmade pottery and iron weapons. This led to the excavation of 361 graves in cemeteries ranging in date from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 900. The emphasis of this project was on the Samad period/culture (300 B.C.-A.D. 900), named after the place where its finds were first recognized. One must remember that archae- ological exploration in the Sultanate began essentially about 1970, and until recently, few stratified finds were avail- able for study. The dating of the Samad culture now rests on some 23 classes of finds with dated foreign parallels and 18 radiocarbon dates. Oman in this period has been superficially characterized as having been under Parthian and Sasanian rule. Following 15 seasons of excavation, how- ever, it is clear that we can go beyond this characterization, and say something about the culture and economy of the Arab inhabitants. In 631 the population did not become Muslim, as the orthodox tradition would have it. Instead, they retained their own burial customs and religion until at least the late ninth century. Until 1992 work centered on grave inventories and cemetery analysis. But in February 1996 excavation resumed on settlements to refine the chro- nology and to study the copper industry during the Late Iron Age. A main goal has been to establish a clearer rel- ative chronology of Oman's Early and Late Iron Age.</page><page sequence="58">388 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 THE "RUBENS VASE" IN BALTIMORE: AN ORIENTAL Copy? Jerome M. Eisenberg, New York Society A large asymmetrical chalcedony vase carved in high relief, now in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, depicts grapevines with bunches of grapes emerging from acanthus leaves, above which are heads of Pan forming two knob- like handles. The rim is surrounded by a gold mount and the base is carved with a rosette of two overlapping sets of six petals. Dated by several scholars to the Graeco- Roman period, it is generally accepted to be the original "Rubens vase" purchased by Peter Paul Rubens in 1619. Ru- bens made a drawing of it, later to be made into an en- graving. Sold by him in 1626-1628, it was shipped to the East Indies, but the boat was captured and the vase ap- parently disappeared. The Walters vase, similar to the engraving in most de- tails, was acquired by William Beckford in England and was first published in 1823. Sold at auction in 1845, it passed through several hands, and was ultimately disposed of by Mrs. Henry Walters, II, at auction in 1941, when it was bought by the Walters Art Gallery. It has been suggested that the work is Renaissance and one scholar even believed it to be a neo-classical work of the late 18th or early 19th century. Having recently examined the vase, I attempt to demonstrate that it is stylistically a product of an Oriental workshop, most probably Chinese, based on the Rubens vase engraving and should indeed be dated to the late 18th or early 19th century. SESSION VIC: ROMAN FUNERARY IMAGERY AND PRACTICES ROMAN FUNERARY PORTRAITS AS VENUS AND MARS AND HARMONY IN MARRIAGE:Julie Ponessa Salathe, Johns Hopkins University The portraits of an empress as the half-nude Venus of Capua and of her husband as the nude Mars Borghese may seem startling to the modern-day viewer (Museo Nazion- ale Romano 108522). Nevertheless, these nude images bore important symbolism in Roman society. The Antonine em- perors juxtaposed the Venus of Capua and Mars Borghese in portraiture to proclaim that the traditional patron de- ities of the imperial house sustained their political legit- imacy. The emperors also associated the Venus-Mars pair with harmony in marriage, a virtue that would yield a stable government and heirs to the imperial throne. Nude types also suggested the beauty of the empress and the virility of the emperor. Private individuals then appropriated and modified this imagery for their own iconographic needs in funerary sculp- ture as D. Kleiner (Latomus 40 [1981] 512-44) has shown. As with the imperial portraits, the assimilation of the wife with Venus alluded to her virtue and beauty, although she did not always remain nude. In some reliefs, the matron wears the stola and palla while the husband wears a toga, indications of citizenship important to former slaves. Both, however, remain in nearly the same Mars-Venus poses. Sim- ilarly, the addition of the dextrarum iunctio, the Roman sym- bol of marriage, was significant for freedmen who, as slaves, had not been allowed legal marriages. In time the imagery evolved even further from the original Capua-Borghese pair. Later imagery on sarcophagi, however, continued to evoke the original iconography into the third century, em- phasizing concepts such as modesty, beauty, citizenship, and marriage. BEAUTY, VIRTUE, AND IMMORTALITY: THE RECLINING FEMALE FROM THE NEW VIA LATINA CATACOMB: Maria Papaioannou-Nasiopoulos, University of Brit- ish Columbia Among the numerous sepulchral monuments situated on the Via Latina outside Rome is a fourth-century cat- acomb discovered in 1955. Notable among the frescoes of this underground monument is an intriguing seminude reclining female depicted on the arcosolium of cubiculum E. A. Ferrua (Le pitture della nuova catacomba di via Latina, Rome 1960) originally interpreted the scene as a portrayal of Cleopatra on her deathbed. A number of other theories concerning the identity of this image have also been pro- posed, but the generally accepted opinion now appears to be that of Guarducci (RendPontAcc 37 [1964-1965] 259-81), who identifies the figure as Tellus. There are grounds, however, for believing that the reclining female portrays the deceased for whom the cubiculum was orig- inally intended, represented in the image of Venus. I be- lieve the pose of the recumbent image stems from the re- clining figures depicted on funerary klinae and relief sculptures. This case is supported by an examination of the seminude recumbent female in funerary art from the first to the fifth centuries, and by analogous epigraphic and literary evidence. EARLY CHRISTIAN TOMB CULT IN GREECE: AN EPIS- COPAL CONNECTION? Carolyn S. Snively, Gettysburg College In 1881 in an Early Christian basilica accidentally dis- covered on the southwest slope of Lykabettos in Athens, the grave of Bishop Klimatios was found, identified by an inscribed marble cover slab mortared to the tomb. Below the inscription a round hole, 0.12 m in diameter, had been cut through the marble slab. This feature is not unique. On Crete similar arrange- ments have been found in a basilica at Knossos on a tomb preserved in the northwest corner of the nave and in Ba- silica A at Chersonesos on a tomb in the narthex. At Cor- inth in the so-called Kodratos Basilica, a lead pipe ran from the inscribed upper cover slabs into the tomb of Bishop Eustathios. Although such apertures might appear to be connected with Roman "libation spouts" for profusiones, liquid offer- ings poured over or into tombs, libation spouts became very rare in the Early Christian period. At Knossos the</page><page sequence="59">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 389 hole had been made before the burial and no stains from libations were observed. Inscriptions identify the occupants of two of the tombs as bishops, and in three instances this was apparently the only tomb within the church; probably all four of these "privileged" tombs held bishops. The small number of examples and the paucity of information do not permit any firm conclusions, but the arrangements suggest cult practices specifically at the tombs of revered bishops or other clergy and the possibility that objects (bran- dea) were inserted into the tombs to touch the bones and thus to become relics. LIGHTING THE FUNERAL FIRE: A NEW TYPE OF Ro- MAN TOMB MONUMENT: Elizabeth Bartman, New York Society Of the hundreds of tomb monuments that once lined the roads leading into Roman cities, relatively few preserve their original appearance today. Missing their landscaping and often their decoration and inscriptions, most barely evoke the original visual impact of these once-impressive structures, the intended guarantors of their owner's mem- ory. By reconstructing several such "lost" monuments, I pre- sent evidence for a previously unrecognized type of Ro- man tomb monument popular during the late first and early second centuries A.D. A funerary altar, it combined a standard carved marble base with an elaborate bronze canopy that shielded the ritual fire (locus). In addition to surviving fragments of the altars themselves, contempo- rary sources such as the reliefs from the Tomb of the Haterii document the altar type. Context suggests that the "domed canopy" may have had a purpose beyond the merely cultic. With its enhanced height and material, the altar type was both costlier and more visually arresting than many contemporary monu- ments. Beyond expanding the repertory of Roman funer- ary monuments, then, this new altar type adds a further gradation to the nuanced commemorative system by which Romans expressed their social hierarchy. IMPERIAL TRIUMPH AND APOTHEOSIS ON THE ANTO- NINE COLUMN: Naomi J. Norman, University of Georgia The Antonine Column functioned as a commemorative, dynastic, and funerary monument. The public spectacle of an imperial funeral shares structural, ritual, and socio- logical ties with the imperial triumph. Together they form a circle, with the one completing the process begun by the other: the triumph made the emperor a god for one day; apotheosis made him a god forever. In this paper I explore the iconographic, ritual, and topographic connections be- tween the two spectacles as illustrated by the Antonine Column. For example, a number of elements on the col- umn base allude to the imperial triumph: the goddess Roma, the representation of Antoninus as a triumphator in his chariot (cf. his position with that of Marcus Aurelius in the triumphal panel from his arch), his paludamentum, and, in his right hand, the eagle-crowned scepter. Similarly, its location in the Campus Martius -the mustering point for triumphal processions and the final resting place for emperors- reinforces and enlarges this connection. Though aligned with Antoninus's consecration altar, the column stood ca. 25 m north of it, preventing worshippers at the altar from "reading" the apotheosis panel facing it. Rather, they would have noticed the statue of Antoninus, gleaming in the sunlight and hovering above the red granite column shaft emerging from the Campus Martius like the flame from the pyre. Surely what the worshipper was meant to experience at that moment was a perpetual reenactment of the apotheosis itself. SESSION VID: AIA/APAJOINT COLLOQUIUM: THE SOCIAL LIFE OF (ROMAN) THINGS THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE LECTUS: Pedar WT Foss, University of Cincinnati Lecti were privileged items in the Roman house; in their various formal and functional permutations, they marked both place and time. They denoted zones of private (beds) and public (dining couches) activity. In the arrangement of their occupants at dinner, they manifested the social order. Stepping up to special beds signified crossing thresh- olds such as marriage (lectus genialis) and death (lectus fu- nebris). No other type of furniture is given more attention by the literary sources in the context of social contest. Neither was the place of any other furniture so clearly in- dicated in the physical fabric of the Roman house, whether by the pattern or elevation of mosaic floors, or by the niches carved into the painted walls. The presence of lecti was clear even in their absence. This paper focuses on the social life of the lectus tricliniaris - how the construction and dec- oration of dining couches reflected and affected the lives of their owners. As the locus for participants in the social melee of the evening meal, dining couches represented a meiange of their positions and aspirations. To many writers, the materials and artistic quality of couches were variously evidence of philosophy, good taste, or corrupt excess. Dining couches gauged place over time; the sequence of locations at which an individual ate, from couch to couch and house to house, "barometrically" described that person's social life. DIALOGUE WITH THE DEAD: THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE ROMAN TOMB: Penelope J.E. Davies, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin For a Roman, remembrance by the living after death was an important means to immortality, and by construct- ing a tomb he might ensure such perpetuation. Yet mon- umental as that tomb might be, it had meaning only through those who looked at it. For this reason, the Romans often selected highly frequented locations for sepulchers to en- sure the dead companionship and remembrance. Funer-</page><page sequence="60">390 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 101 ary rites and tomb maintenance were crucial ways of per- petuating memory, and provisions were often made, independent of the tomb's design, to ensure that they were kept up. Rites took place at a tomb during the Parentalia, as well as on personal anniversaries; but how much better if the deceased could somehow be assured the casual passerby's attention. This issue, it seems, was one that tomb designers consciously tackled, as they labored to reach out to those who had not come specifically to visit, but were merely passing by. Inscriptions might be phrased to be read aloud, in quasi-magical fashion, to perpetuate the deceased through the spoken words of the living. More than that, though, as monuments commemorating freedman and aris- tocrat alike attest, the tomb's architectural or sculptural form might secure the visitor's attention by requiring his interaction with the monument on either a cognitive or a physical level, thus establishing a living dialogue with the dead. THUMBS IN ANCIENT ROME: POLLEX AS INDEX: Anthony Corbeill, University of Kansas The thumb (pollex) emerges across Roman culture in many contexts-to express good will, in the apotropaic "fig," and at gladiatorial contests. Reference works disagree in interpreting these gestures (e.g., Forcellini s.v., Hecken- bach RVV 9: 2.99, Otto 283, Courtney ad Iuv. 3.36). Using textual evidence, I assess the thumb's significance. I then introduce visual evidence to support my philological hy- potheses. In particular I conclude with a fresh analysis of the sign given for death in gladiatorial combat. Ateius Capito's derivation of pollex from pollere ("to have power") recurs in Lactantius (opif 10.24) and Isidorus (or. 11.1.70). The use of the thumb in medical/magical texts indicates that its perceived power reached outside the ety- mological tradition. Consideration of the thumb's magi- cal properties allows me to explicate a relief containing an "unintelligible gesture" (Ryberg). Similar associations elucidate a proverbial use of the thumb attested by Pliny, whereby "pressing the thumbs" conveys good will (pollices premere; HN 28.25). By examining rhetorical uses of the thumb (Quint. inst. 11.3.104, 119; Fulg. virg. cont. 86.21), I conclude that Pliny's expression indicates pressing the thumb down on the enclosed fist. Two material represen- tations, in which a gladiator appears to be given the sign of missio, represent variations on Pliny's gesture of good will (Munich; Nimes). Conversely, "thumbs up" advises the death-blow (cf. infesto pollice; Quint. inst. 11.3.119, Apul. met. 2.21). I conclude by reexamining the vague references to the gesture in our textual sources ([con]verso pollice). THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER: CULTURE AND THE VALUE OF ROMAN LAND: Andrew M. Riggsby, University of Texas at Austin Rawson (in Finley, Studies in Roman Property) argues that 1) Romans did not connect holding individual pieces of land to family honor, 2) they in fact had no "sentimental" attachment to land at all, and 3) their prescriptive claims on the subject are not merely conventional, but unmoti- vated. She depends on an oversimplified model in which cultural demands take the form of simple imperatives (e.g., "don't sell the family farm"); if such imperatives cannot be found, a purely "economic" explanation is assumed. It is more accurate to see culture, with Geertz, as providing codes and norms by which actions can be described and evaluated. This paper analyzes descriptions of land transfers in a number of genres (letters, invective, forensic oratory, agri- cultural and moralistic literature). The Roman elite had multiple investments (economic and otherwise) in landed property. One can account for both the pressures against selling land and the ability of Roman aristocrats to sell in practice by asking what kinds of gains and losses were at stake in these transactions. Land was an "enclaved" com- modity; normative expectations demanded that it be ex- changed only for other specialized commodities, primar- ily the daughters of other aristocrats. Other uses were viewed as deviant and involved a loss of status. CATULLUS'S MASCULINE NAPKINS: REIFICATION AND ROMAN IDENTITY:Jacqui Sadashige, University of Pennsylvania The texts of antiquity are littered with things. From Plautus's menus to Cicero's accounts of Verres's plunder to the curio shop that is Pliny's Natural History, Roman tex- tuality recalls and reinforces Roman materiality. The poetry of Catullus offers a key example and typically figures Ro- man culture's attitudes toward its own material abundance as vexed. In poems such as 12 and 13, sentimentality ac- tively supplants monetary value; in poems such as 28 and 29, sexual and imperialistic impulses are conflated. The former attitude recalls Neoteric urbanitas or lepor; the lat- ter resembles Republican conservatism. In this way, the poems establish a distinction between emotional and finan- cial investment. Not surprisingly, much of Catullan schol- arship has inadvertently duplicated this dynamic by work- ing within categories such as "campaign," "Lesbia," and "occasional" poems. A focus on material objects turns attention to the very thing underlying the financial/sentimental binary. I focus upon the napkins of Catullus 12 to explore the relation- ship(s) between materiality and subjectivity specifically be- cause the souvenir napkins embody a complex nexus of luxury, sentiment, experience, and matter. I draw upon the work of Georg Lukfics to argue ultimately that the poly- metric poems produce a model of the Roman subject that is physically and emotionally enabled by the circuits of commerce and power structuring the Late Republic. Such a treatment of Catallus moves toward reconciling a num- ber of disparate themes, contributes to a complex concep- tion of the ancient self, and emphasizes the materiality of poetic composition itself.</page><page sequence="61">1997] THE 98TH ANNUAL MEETING 391 INDEX OF AUTHORS Each author's name is followed by the page number(s) in this issue on which his or her abstract is printed.
