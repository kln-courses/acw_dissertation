<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES ments of these enduring problems-as are many other contributions to this book. A second major criterion by which volumes such as The History of Humanity can be usefully evaluated is theoretical perspective. One might expect a lack of the- oretical unity given the multicultural origins of the con- tributors, but in fact the theoretical perspective is quite consistent: these authors attempt to provide simple descriptive summaries, and all appear untroubled by epistemological debates currently dominating theory in, for example, Anglo-American and Scandinavian archae- ology. S. De Laet's introductory essay includes a dis- missal of the "New Archaeology," not on the basis of the "postprocessualist" critique, but on the grounds that most of it was implicit in earlier European archaeology, and that those elements that were not are, for the most part, extensions of theoretical ideas beyond their proper application. De Laet states that "[p]rehistory, as under- stood in the present work, is a historical discipline, and history-like many other human sciences-is not nomo- thetic, but idiographic . . ." (p. 9). Few, if any, of the con- tributors to this volume appear to disagree with him. Some of the theoretical debates in contemporary archaeology, such as the "postprocessual" critique of traditional archaeology, were in rather embryonic form when most of these chapters were written, and it is unfair to judge the theoretical perspective of these many authors based on these contributions, in which they were asked to provide descriptive summaries of specific segments of the archaeological record. Yet it is interesting that while many contemporary archaeolo- gists are calling for greater inclusiveness in world archaeological scholarship and suppression of its per- ceived Western "biases" and presumed imperialist agenda, this volume-one of the most multicultural, inclusive, and least ethnically "Western" in recent memory-almost entirely ignores such issues. Indeed, few, if any, of the chapters in this book are significant- ly different in method, theory, or in any other way from that of 1950s era European American archaeology. Postprocessualists might see this as proof of the need for a more critical tradition in archaeology, but if The History of Humanity is any indication, non-Western archaeologists don't all necessarily want to write their own, unique, non-Western archaeologies and claim their own pasts; many of them seem to be entirely com- fortable in, and with, the format and intellectual tradi- tions of traditional Western archaeological scholarship. Another criterion by which volumes such as The History of Humanity can be judged is comprehensive- ness, and in this regard this is an admirable book. Most of the classic problems of prehistory are presented here in impressive detailed and professional format. Y. Coppens and D. Geraads's overview for "The Period of Homo Habilis and Homo erectus," for example, includes a reasonable summary of such problems as the inferred speech capabilities of early hominids and the concepts of phyletic gradualism vs. punctuated equilibrium as metaphors for the rhythm of human evolution. Similarly, the several models for the origins of Homo sapiens sapi- ens, particularly with regard to the relationship of the Neanderthals to modem humans, is covered in extensive detail by numerous scholars, with 0. Bar-Yosef survey- ing western Asia, K. Valoch reviewing western Europe, F. Wendorf, A. Close, and R. Schild discussing Africa, and B. Vandermeersch providing an overview of this problem. The transition from Neolithic societies to the beginnings of state societies is well represented in chap- ters in this volume, such as L. Krzyzaniak's survey of late prehistoric Egypt. The evidence concerning human colonization of the New World is also discussed at length by A. Bryan, J. Lorenzo, and others. With regard to the general comprehensiveness of this volume, it is particularly useful to have authorita- tive summaries of less-well-known archaeological records, such as L. Lumbreas Salcedo's review of the equatorial and tropical Andes, W Solheim's discussion of southeast Asia and Korea, A. H. Masry's prehistory of the Arabian peninsula, and D. W. Phillipson's review of neolithic Africa outside of Egypt. This volume also benefits from having senior scholars report on areas where research results have not been widely dissemi- nated, in part because of publication in non-Western languages, such as R. V Joshi's chapters on southern Asia, V Alexeev's review of the territory of the former U.S.S.R. in the Upper Paleolithic, and A. Zhimin's summary of the Chinese neolithic. Concerning the likely distribution of this book, its 716 pages, complexity, and high cost are such that only the most optimistic professor would assign it as a text in a college-level class. Most chapters are quite detailed and presented at a professional level-that is, few if any of these chapters would be out of place, for exam- ple, in The Journal of World Prehistory or a similar periodical. Thus, the professional archaeologist is like- ly to find this book a useful reference book for some years to come. The History of Humanity is the first vol- ume in a seven-volume set, which together covers his- tory through the twentieth century, and the complete set of volumes merits wide distribution in the world's libraries-especially if this edition of the set is avail- able in six languages, as the first edition was.

Special sites deserve special attention. Franchthi cave is an extraordinary site in the context of European prehis- tory and now the subject of some of the most detailed, well-considered reporting in European archaeology. As is well known, Franchthi's importance derives from the fact that its deposits provide a continuous record from the late Upper Paleolithic to the end of the Neolithic. Franchthi thus spans the critical transition from forag- ing to farming. No other site in Europe offers a compa- rable sequence. Publication of the Franchthi material is now in the specialist phase, in which detailed analyses are present- ed as separate monographs. Karen D. Vitelli's Franchthi Neolithic Pottery I is the first of two volumes treating the site's ceramics. It is unquestionably the best pottery report yet to come out of Southeast European archaeol- ogy. Anyone who has ever had to deal with a very large ceramic assemblage will appreciate what Vitelli has done here: from more than a million pieces she has put together an extraordinarily thorough and clear account of the typological, technological, and social aspects of pottery at Franchthi. Here she treats the first two of Franchthi's five ceramic phases, ending this volume with the middle Neolithic. Volume II will present the last three phases. Vitelli begins with the question of classification. She cheerfully abandons the old, ad hoc typologies of Greek Neolithic pottery in favor of a new scheme that flows from completely reasonable first principles. Vitelli's Franchthi pottery is grouped into units based on potters' behaviors, the choices potters can be seen to have made in confronting a range of material, technical, and social constraints. These choices are preserved in the compo- sition of the fired clay body and the surface finishes of every sherd. Thus Vitelli partitions the Franchthi assem- blage into two classes (calcareous and noncalcareous), several wares, and a number of varieties. Vitelli's approach is relentlessly and refreshingly low-tech. She finds her most useful variables through a lOx hand lens. Now, although it is true that hand lens inspection cannot ever provide very detailed compositional information, it is equally the case that a million-sherd assemblage is too big to thin section, neutron activate, or micro-probe. Vitelli does use a small number of petrographic studies as a backup, but they contribute relatively little to the overall thrust of her analysis. Most of the volume is devoted to a painstaking description of the first two ceramic phases at Franchthi, and of every ware and variety of pottery therein. Appropriately, a great deal of attention is given to Urfimis ware, the most elegant pottery of the Greek Neolithic, which dominates Franchthi's second ceramic phase. Vitelli recognizes five varieties of Urfirnis ware, which she treats in terms of composition, vessel build- ing procedures, surface treatment, and firing practices. Vitelli suggests that the Urfimis pottery, much of it consisting of "high risk" forms, sharply angular or with frequent changes in contour, marks a distinct break, a new virtuosity, in the routines of hand building clay vessels compared to Franchthi's first ceramic phase. The Urfimis ware is also marked by frequent innova- tions in firing technique. The last part of the volume is a too-brief treatment of a set of linked socioeconomic questions: the location and scale of production, the utilitarian and symbolic functions of pottery at Franchthi, and the identity of the Franchthi potters. To my mind the most interesting con- clusions here concern the Urfirnis ware: "The pots con- vey an impression not of potters concerned with invest- ing the least amount of effort for the most efficient, useful kitchen containers, but of skilled potters show- ing off their skills" (p. 215). Vitelli's intriguing sugges- tion is that the Urfirnis ware was made for public con- texts, often by specialist potters, perhaps women of high status: special pots and specialist pottery, in other words. These are all stimulating questions, and in this volume Vitelli has set the standards for their future dis- cussion elsewhere in Southeast European archaeology. With Lauren E. Talalay's Deities, Dolls, and Devices: Neolithic Figurines from Franchthi Cave, Greece, we move to a detailed consideration of a vastly smaller data set. Only 24 figurines, most of them frag- ments, were recovered from Franchthi. Compared to Neolithic figurine assemblages from the north Balkans, this is a relatively tiny collection, but Talalay sets out to extract from it as much as she can. The result is a satis- fying blend of detailed description, careful regional comparison, and applied theory. Talalay begins with a close description of the data set. She then goes on to discuss how the various fig- urines were produced, what sort of labor effort they rep- resent, and who might have made them. In a sense, all of this is necessary prologue to broaching the kinds of questions that are more often discussed in connection 158 [Vol. 61, No. 1, 1996]</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES with Neolithic figurines. Drawing a careful distinction between use and meaning, Talalay surveys the ethno- graphic record to find a range of uses and meanings for small anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures. Applying this to the Franchthi collection leads her to some interesting suggestions. Some of the figurines may well have been toys or dolls. Others, in particular a group of zoomorphic figurines, may have been objects of sympathetic magic. Elsewhere in southern Greece animal figurines appear "suddenly" at the end of the Neolithic, at a time when herding appears to have become a more widespread practice; Talalay suggests that the two are linked, that the production of zoomor- phic figurines allayed the anxieties associated with the risks of expanded animal management strategies. Another group of figurine fragments is even more interesting. There are at Franchthi (and elsewhere in the neighborhood) split-leg figurines-that is, figurines deliberately designed so that the legs can be easily detached. Since, ethnographically, objects made to be split often serve as tokens of contract and/or identity, Talalay suggests that the split-leg figurines mark the participation of persons at Franchthi in a network of relations encompassing five other Peloponnesian Neolithic sites. All of these suggestions are refreshing alternatives to shopworn claims that Neolithic figurines in Southeast Europe represent the goddesses and gods of "Old Europe"; Talalay finds no convincing evidence for the existence of Neolithic religions or fertility cults. The volume finishes on a regional level, with lists and illustrations of the other Neolithic figurines known from southern Greece, which serve to compare Franchthi with the rest of the Peloponnesos. Like Renfrew, Talalay does not want figurine research to run before walking. Considering the metic- ulousness of her work, though, we are treated to a pret- ty brisk hike. Before Writing, Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform. DENISE SCHMANDT-BESSERAT, with foreword by WILLIAM W. HALLO. University of Texas Press, Austin, 1992. xv + 269 pp., illustrations, notes, index. $ 60.00 (cloth). Reviewed by J. P. Dessel, Bryn Mawr College. Can the primordial origins of literacy be traced to enig- matic ceramic objects, which begin to appear in the Near East during the Neolithic period? This is precise- ly the question that Denise Schmandt Besserat has pio- neered over the last 20 years. "Tokens" are small, hand- made objects ranging in size from 1 to 5 cm. By the late eighth millennium the use of tokens had spread throughout the Near East, where they continued to be used into the second millennium. Although they can be made from stone or other materials, the vast majority are produced from clay. This volume is the culmination of Schmandt- Besserat's research into clay tokens, which began in 1969. It serves to assemble much of her already pub- lished material into a single, comprehensive volume. Initially, Schmandt-Besserat was interested in the earli- est use of fired ceramics in the Near East. Tokens fre- quently turned up in her research on early ceramics, and her fascination with them increased. Her sugges- tion, building on an earlier proposal by Pierre Amiet that such tokens are part of a counting system, led her to consider further the role of tokens in the develop- ment of literacy. In the course of her research, Schmandt-Besserat has examined more 8,000 tokens from 108 sites in Anatolia, Iran, Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Syria. The volume is divided into sections presenting data, interpretation, and a series of typological charts of tokens. The first part is a thorough, well-organized description of the entire corpus of excavated tokens from the Near East. Tokens are divided into plain and complex types, a distinction that significantly figures into her understanding of the history of writing. Each of the basic types is presented separately and organized according to temporal and geographic considerations. The contexts and functional ascriptions of token assem- blages are then discussed in greater detail and arranged chronologically. The section concludes with a discus- sion of the emergence of the more highly evolved off- spring of tokens, such as token strings, envelopes, and impressed tablets. The manner in which this data is presented continu- ally reinforces a unilinear evolution of tokens. Schmandt-Besserat gives the impression that all tokens, regardless of date or location, belong to a unified, coherent, and widely recognizable cognitive frame- work. Part of this framework includes a Neolithic counting system that seamlessly evolved into an abstract writing system by the fourth millennium. The interpretive section is more readable. Here Schmandt-Besserat more fully considers the evolution- ary process represented by tokens and the implications of counting systems for social organization. In this the- oretical arena Schmandt-Besserat's overall approach and use of unsupported inferences becomes problemat- ic. Can a complex and multifaceted process such as the development of writing be understood within the con- fines of a single unilinear evolutionary trajectory? Schmandt-Besserat's first contention that the entire 159</page></plain_text>
