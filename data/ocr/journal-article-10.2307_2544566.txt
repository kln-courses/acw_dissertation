For the last twenty years readers of Terence Cave (The Cornucopian Text), Thomas M. Greene (The Light in Troy), David Quint (Origin and Originality in Renaissance Literature), and Timothy Hampton (Writingfrom History: The Rhetoric of Exemplarity in Renaissance Literature) have come to realize that Renaissance literature constitutes both a celebration of plenitude and a falling away from an ideal; that it affirms a rupture between an apparent fullness located in the past and the uncertainty of its own future inexhaustibility. Michel Jeanneret's new book further elaborates on the prodigal image of cornucopia to characterize the productive- ness of late Renaissance discourse in slightly different terms, shifting the emphasis to plastic- ity of content and mobility of form. His Perpetuum Mobile is a brilliant exercise in cultural Geistgeschichte by way of historically contextualized aesthetics. It explores a selection of six- teenth-century (mostly French) literary texts and (mostly Italian) drawings or paintings, bringing out their spectacular Protean thrust with superb vigor and subtlety. To be sure, the paradigmatic classical subtext for this remarkable study is Ovid's Metamor- phoses, whose very first line ("In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas") could characterize Jeanneret's own purpose: i.e. "to tell of things which have been transformed into shapes of a different kind." It could serve as an epigraph to the entire book, although Jeanneret chooses instead the last line of Ronsard's most famous elegy: "La matiere demeure, et la forme se perd" ("Matter endures, and Form vanishes")-a tribute to one of the greatest poets of artis- tic formlessness. As Jeanneret convincingly shows, sixteenth-century writers and painters were creatively obsessed by the constant flux and changing forms that Pythagoras had described in the famous Roman mythography which was to become a Renaissance best- seller. To some extentJeanneret's nonchronological approach and diverse sampling of artists and writers contribute to shaping the overall impression of energized chaos and disordered productivity. Moving from Guillaume Du Bartas's creational poetics to Leonardo's cataclys- mic gyrations, or from Arcimboldo's anthropomorphic riddles to Rabelais's disquieting monsters, the reader is confronted with clashing fragments and irresistibly sucked into the whirlwind of centrifugal images.Jeanneret's mimetic assemblage of metamorphotic analo- gies lends credibility to his thematic approach through the performative character of his own narrative. His vision of the sixteenth century is set against the traditional image of Aristote- lian rules and the Neoplatonic search for cosmic harmony. Imperfection, fragmentation and plurality of forms come to characterize the Cinquecento's aesthetic consciousness and, through some kind of paradoxical twist, eventually displace the humanist yearning for clas- sical self-control. Regardless of their claims to the contrary, artists are no longer primarily concerned with a domesticated natura naturata; they deliberately and lustfully engulf them- selves in a proliferating natura naturans. In other words, Cinquecento Mannerism begs to be rethought and redefined as a fundamentally "baroque" phenomenon. Not every Renaissance specialist will buy uncritically this new vision of the period. Although blurring and fading techniques-sfumato and non finito, esquisse and grisaille- become central to many late Mannerist representations, one may wonder if they can be interpreted as depicting an increasingly unstable worldview. At the same time, the principles of permanence and stability have not necessarily lost their positive values in aesthetic con- sciousness. Most artists and writers actually yearn for immortality and strive to build monu- ments against ephemerality for their own name and fame. It is revealing that the French words for order and symmetry do not figure in Jeanneret's Index rerum, whereas "chaos"</page><page sequence="2">582 Sixteenth Century Journal XXIX / 2 (1998) recurs from page 6 to 300. Hubris has perhaps too willingly displaced mediocritas. Yet, there are at least two major Northern European writers who do validate Jeanneret's Protean vision: Erasmus, who, in his Adages, declared himself to be "more versatile than the God ofVersatility himself" (see his Proteo mutabilior); and, above all, Montaigne, who refused to portray anything but change because, as he claimed, "the world is in constant motion" and "stability itself is nothing but a more languid form of movement" (book 3, chapter 2). Gone from the Essais is the "rich, polished picture, formed according to art": it is paradox- ically replaced with "grotesques and monstrous bodies, pieced together of diverse members, without definite shape, having no order, sequence, or proportion other than accidental" (book 1, chapter 28). Jeanneret's thesis is powerfully validated here, with the open-ended and constantly evolving form of the essay, which invites questions, objections or reserva- tions, and grafts reflexive operations onto the main logical thread of the discourse. Like Montaigne, Michel Jeanneret follows the exemplary model of Socrates, who always asked questions to stir up discussion, "never concluding, never satisfying" (book 2, chapter 12). In his dazzlingly beautiful analyses Jeanneret never hesitates to move beyond his postu- lates and address controversial issues. To each issue he brings articulate, rapid-fire commen- tary that can be brilliantly clarifying. One ends up admiring Professor Jeanneret for his scholarship, his intelligence, and his willingness to be vulnerable.The problems he has exam- ined in his Perpetuum Mobile are equally important to us. His book reveals, often movingly, the continuing problems and possibilities of post-modern criticism in the face of Renais- sance art and literature.
