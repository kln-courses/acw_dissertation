<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolutionary Terms for Parasitic Species Wolfdietrich Eichler's proposal (Syst. Zool., 15, 1966:216-218) of the evolutionary terms synhospitalic for two or more para- sitic species occurring on the same host species, and allohospitalic for two or more parasitic species occurring on different, but not on the same, host species, interested me as I had proposed two similar, but broader, terms in a manuscript submitted to the Smithsonian Institution some months ear- lier (but not yet published). I was dealing with avian brood parasites, particularly with the glossy cuckoos of the genus Chrysococ- cyx, and felt the need for terms by which to distinguish different types of host-para- site relationships. My proposed terms, which could be applied to direct ectopara- sites such as Eichler's mallophaga, as well as to less immediately contactual but yet ethologically comparable, brood parasites, are as follows. Alloxenia, with alloxenic as its adjective, describes the situation where two or more different species of parasites make use of different species of hosts. Homoxenia, with homoxenic as its adjec- tive, covers the situation where two or more different species of parasites make use of the same species of hosts. As a matter of fact, I had thought of the root that Eichler has used during my preoc- cupation with the problem of coining the new terms, and decided that xenia was shorter and also was less apt to be looked upon as anthropomorphic than a root that might give rise to such expressions as hos- pital or hospitality. Also I was strongly ad- vised by one of my U.C.L.A. colleagues in classics to use xenia. I still think it is to be preferred.
