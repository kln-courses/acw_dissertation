<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peirce's Speculative Rhetoric and thè Problem of Naturai Law John Michael Krois Peirce compared thè scope of his philosophy with the System of Aristotle and indicated that for a long time future thinkers would be engaged in filling out its détails (LI).1 Among the parts of his philosophy that Peirce left unfinished is the theory of law. In the following I want to investigate what could be considered a Peir- cean theory of naturai law. It is Peircean because it is drawn from Peirce's writings, in particular from his theory of signs. Yet its viability should not be judged only as an interprétation of Peirce, but in regard to whether it makes a contribution to overcoming the present-day crisis in natural-law theory. By this I am referring to the post-eighteenth Century rise of skepticism concerning the objectivity of naturai law and the doctrine of human rights. This doctrine, so typical of the Enlightenment, and the contract thé- ories upon which it was based suffered radical criticisms by Hegel and Marx in the nineteenth Century. Their views of the historical validity of law in terms of thè state or emerging social class were rejected by twentieth-century Neo-Positivists who reduced all law to positive law thereby granting it no further basis than utilitarian considérations. Contemporary German philosophers influenced by Peirce (Karl- Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas) hâve developed théories of norms that are intended to overcome this situation by showing that ethical standards are not arbitrary, but hâve a kind of objectivity which they explicate in terms of the theory of communication. It is not my intention to discuss the détails or acceptability of their views, but to make référence to them in an effort to bring out what I take to be a Peircean theory which is similar to theirs. A criticai comparison of thèse théories would be a subject for another paper. In the first part of what follows I présent Peirce's theory of "specu- lative rhetoric," i.e., the third and final division of his theory of signs or "semeiotic." The second part outlines the way this theory can contribute to the theory of naturai law. Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 14, No. 1, Winter 1981.

Introduction: The Third Branch of Semeiotic Peirce's theory of signs has three divisions. Stated in thè brief- est terms, thè first division, speculative grammar,2 élaborâtes thè generai triadic structure of signs and includes Peirce's famous divisions and classifications of sign types. The second division of Peirce's theory of signs, speculative critic, studies thè relationship of signs to their objects and so is interested in thè problems of truth and thè validity of arguments (2.229). Finally, speculative rhetoric deals with thè ends or aims of sign interprétation, i.e., with what Peirce calls signs' "interprétants." The term "specula- tive" here indicates that this is a theoretical study, not a doctrine of how to persuade, or rhetoric in thè ordinary sense of thè term.3 Peirce himself admitted in about 1904 that "Of thè three branches of semeiotics, thè two first, thè speculative grammar and critic have been greatly elaborated. The speculative rhetoric has been comparatively neglected."4 The quantitatively small amoünt of work that Peirce devoted to thè subject of specula- tive rhetoric qualifies it as an unfìnished task of Peircean schol- arship which must be completed if we are to understand his theory of signs as a whole.5 Moreover, Peirce himself evidently considered speculative rhetoric to be an important subject and at least as deserving of attention as thè other two divisions of semeiotic, but given thè architectonic structure of his semeiotic, work on thè third division could progress only after develop- ment of thè first two.6 He called speculative rhetoric thè "high- est and most living branch of logic" (2.333, ca. 1895) and said it was a study "destined to grow into a colossal doctrine" (3.454, 1896). I hope to show that part of this anticipated growth can be seen in speculative rhetoric's importance to thè field of naturai law theory. Before saying anything about this, however, it is necessary first to clarify further the nature of the third branch of semeiotic. 1.2. "Speculative Rhetoric" vs. "Methodeutic" Peirce's conception of the third branch of semeiotic appears to be broader than the field he termed "speculative rhetoric." About 1906 Peirce renamed what he formally called speculative rhetoric by terming it "methodeutic" (4.9), but I think that the question should be raised whether he subsumed all the problems</page><page sequence="3">18 SPECULATIVE RHETORIC AND NATURAL LAW dealt with in speculative rhetoric under methodeutic when he renamed thè third branch of semeiotic. In 1911 Peirce wrote that thè greater part of his life had been devoted to methodeutic and that his hardest and best work was in that field,7 but he admitted that his work on speculative rhetoric had been limited. I cannot offer a complete examination of possible différences between methodeutic and speculative rhetoric, nevertheless I want at least to point out what might be considered reasons for drawing a distinction between them. Peirce described methodeutic as a theoretical study of what is advantageous that "strongly resembles thè purely mathematical part of politicai economy, which is also a theoretical study of advantages" (NE:YV, 26). 8 Methodeutic is a theoretical science of thè instrumentai or, in Peirce's words, "a generai doctrine of methods of attaining purposes, in generai . . .M (2.108). For ex- ample, methodeutic studies thè process through which thè suit- ability of certain justifiable hypothèses for testing by experiment is determined and, hence, their probable benefit to the further- ance of knowledge. (NE: IV, 62; cf. 6.488). Moreover, method- eutic also studies principles of définition, of rendering ideas clear, and of classification (NE: IV, 62). It is therefore the field where Peirce's most famous work was conducted, embracing his theory of the fixation of belief, logic of scientific inquiry, and his prag- matic theory of meaning. AH this, as well as the study of the conditions a sign must meet in order to be pertinent to a purpose (NE.IV, 62), falls under "methodeutic." It is therefore easy to understand that Peirce could speak of it as the field of his hardest and best work. In addition to the studies already mentioned, Peirce's investiga- tion of what he termed the "Ethics of Terminology" may be classified under methodeutic. This doctrine is concerned with the use of symbols from the standpoint of the économies of research (2.220, cf. MS 776, p. 2), however, its set of rules (2.226) is ultimately motivated by thè desire to be honest and so is directed to a moral end (5.413) in addition to that of truth. This sketch of methodeutic can suffice to show, I believe, that it is a theoretical study of instrumental questions, i.e., the best way to certain ends. It is this economie or instrumental character that I find missing in Peirce's descriptions of speculative rhetoric, which leads me to believe that it cannot be subsumed under methodeutic without further qualifications about the nature of</page><page sequence="4">JOHN MICHAEL KROIS 19 that study. This will become evident when we consider specula- tive rhetoric direct ly. In his 1867 paper, "On a New List of Catégories," Peirce intro- duced what he called "a trivium of conceivable sciences" (1.559) which later became the three divisions of semeiotic discussed above. The third of thèse sciences, he said, would "treat of the formal conditions of the force of Symbols, or their power of ap- pealing to a mind, that is of their référence in generai to interpré- tants, and this might be called formal rhetoric" (1.559). Peirce referred back to this initial formulation of what he later termed "speculative rhetoric" many times (e.g., in 1893: 4.116 and 142; in 1896: 3.430; in 1897: 2.229; and in 1908: 8.342) and, with one important exception, it is quite compatible with his formulation of speculative rhetoric in his most systematic paper on the sub- ject, which was not written until about 1904. There Peirce defines speculative rhetoric as the science of the "essential conditions under which a sign may determine an interprétant sign of itself and of whatever it signifies, or may, as a sign bring about a physical result."9 Peirce's late work on the theory of interprétants included a distinction between emotional, energetic, and final or logicai interprétants; energetic interprétants can be muscular ef- forts and so lead to a physical result (5.475). l(l This notion can be understood as an explication of the 1867 locution "force of sym- bols." However, the real différence between thèse two défini- tions is that the one from 1904 makes no mention of a "mind." It uses a completely semeiotic vocabulary to describe semeiosis. I will discuss the significance of this change later. At the moment I want to cali attention to the fact that Peirce regards speculative rhetoric as a study of the "essential condi- tions" of semeiosis, not instrumental considérations. According to Peirce "Its most essential business is to ascertain by logicai analysis, greatly facilitated by the other branches of semeiotics, what are the indispensible conditions of a signes acting to deter- mine another sign nearly équivalent to itself."11 Peirce mentions two essential conditions in his paper: that the object represented also have the character of a sign and that an entirely new sign cannot be created in an act of communication. These ideas go all the way back to Peirce's 1868 articles (5.213-357) in which he criticized the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself as something incognizable, i.e., not having the character of a sign (something we cannot talk about, yet which is talked about in the act of</page><page sequence="5">20 SPECULATIVE RHETORIC AND NATURAL LAW saying it cannot be talked about) and thè Cartesian assumption that there is intuitive cognition, i.e., an entirely new beginning of semeiosis independent of previous semeiosis. This early semeiotic theory of knowledge set Peirce on a path towards Hegelianism.12 This emerged explicitly in later years when Peirce began referring to speculative rhetoric as "objective logic" (e. g., ca. 1896: 1.444; 1902: 2.111) and said that he did this because he wanted to indi- cate that it is "like Hegel's logic" (1.444). Again, I will come back to this later. Besides studying thè universal formal conditions of all forms of sign interprétation or semeiosis, Peirce also conceiyed speculative rhetoric to encompass a number of further specialized studies which would deal with spécifie types of semeiosis. He derived his classification of these special studies from thè triadic nature of semeiosis so that they concentrate on thè nature of what is to be conveyed (thè object), thè mode of communication (thè repre- sentamen), and thè signs into which they are to be interpreted (thè interprétant).13 Peirce's analysis of assertion falls under thè heading of a special study which spans ali of these. Jarre tt Brock has shown in his paper on "Peirce and Searle on Assertion"14 that Peirce included thè utterer's intention to induce thè intended interpréter to believe thè asserted proposition among thè "essen- tial conditions" of assertion. This is because for Peirce (but not for Searle) to assert something is to assume responsibility for what is said. Hence, to assert something and not care whether anybody believes thè assertion is to be irresponsible. The study of assertion belongs to speculative rhetoric for Peirce, therefore, because it is an example of those special studies which deal with signs that are intended to be translated into human thought.15 Here, too, this study is not directed to instrumentai concerns, but to thè "essential conditions" of such semeiosis. 1.3. Speculative Rhetoric and "Objective Logic" Peirce says that his science of speculative rhetoric can only "inaccurately" be termed "objective logic" (1.444). The reason for this inaccuracy is doubtless thè fact that thè logicai "laws of thè évolution of thought" (1.444) which speculative rhetoric would explicate are conceived in terms of signs, not ideas. Signs cannot be conceived of as prior to nature and mind thè way that Hegel conceived of logic.16 Peirce conceived speculative rhetoric</page><page sequence="6">JOHN MICHAEL KROIS 21 as a study of what "would be," rather than as a study of laws of what has to be. He understood thè question of whether there was a doctrine of signs corresponding to Hegel's objective logic in terms of "whether there be a life in Signs, so that - thè requisite vehicle being présent - they will go through a certain order of development ..." (2. 111).17 For this to be thè case there must, Peirce argues, be another mode of being involved than existential fact, namely thè reality of law in thè sense of a "would be," or what Peirce calls thirdness (2.115-118). Speculative rhetoric, at least insofar as it is like "objective logic," does not study how human beings use signs per se&gt; but thè laws by which signs would determine other signs. Its subject matter is interprétants, not Interpreters. Peirce never wrote a work on thèse laws thè way that Hegel wrote his Science of Logic, but such a work would differ radically from thè Hegelian opus, just as it would differ equally from a work on rhetoric in thè ordinary sense of thè term or a work on formal logic. Speculative rhetoric as objective logic is by définition not a study of uninterpreted calculi or of psychol- ogy. Its subject matter is thè development of interprétants. This brings us back to thè différence mentioned earlier be- tween Peirce's first, mentalistic, characterization of "formai rhe- toric" from 1867 and his later description of speculative rhetoric which only uses semeiotic terminology. It also brings us to thè most enigmatical part of Peirce's theory of signs, as he was him- self most aware. 1.4. The "Sop to Cerebus" The feature in question hère is thè generality of Peirce's con- ception of signs, or rather semeiosis. In a letter to Lady Welby, Peirce expressed himself on this problem as follows. "I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so détermines an effect upon a person, which effect I cali its Interprétant, that thè latter is thereby mediately determined by thè former. My insertion of 'upon a person' is a sop to Cerebus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood."18 As Max Fisch has pointed out in his commentary on this passage, Peirce is ref erring to thè fact that he lapses into talk about human beings or minds as a way of pacify- ing readers who cannot follow a discussion of semeiosis in purely semeiotic terms.19 Peirce explained his difficulty in another piace</page><page sequence="7">22 SPECULATIVE RHETORIC AND NATURAL LAW where he wrote: "A good many persons who teli themselves that they hold anthropomorphism in réprobation will nevertheless opine that I am not anthropomorphic enough in my account of logic as a science of signs and in describing signs without making any explicit référence to the human mind" (NE: IV, 313, ca. 1906). Actually, the problem Peirce refers to here also goes all the way back to the 1868 séries of papers where he argues that signs are the reality of the mind (5.213-317) or, rather, that "the mind is a sign developing according to the laws of inference" (5.313). Some of Peirce's Statements in his paper on "Some Con- séquences of Four Incapacities" seem outrageous, such as when he contends that according to his conception of signs, there is no important différence between a word and a human being (5.313). But rather than enter here into this difficulty, posed by the broadness of what Peirce calls a "sign," which lets him term man "a sign," I want to stress the corollary that semeiosis cannot be reduced to the acts of particular human Interpreters. It does not contradict the conventionality of signs, so often stressed in the French tradition of semeiology,20 to note, as Peirce does, that signs, once created, often have effects far beyond the intentions or control of the one who was first their author. To recognize this fact, moreover, does not entail falling into the illusion which Marxian theorists term "reification"21 or it would be necessary to deny the historical effects of written words that influence history long after the death of their author. Granting this much objectiv- ity to semeiosis, speculative rhetoric is a subject of interest to naturai law theory. In the rest of this paper I will try to show why I think this is so. ILI. Semeiotic and the Problem of Theory and Practice In a recently published manuscript from about 1904, Peirce discusses what he calls "the two great tasks of humanity, Theory and Practice" (NE: IV, 240). He conceived these tasks there in the light of his theory of signs, regarding the world in bot h cases in terms of its nature as a sign. Peirce désignâtes the semeiotic character of the universe with Aristotle's term "entelechy" (NE: IV, 239f ) in order to indicate that what he has in mind is the perfection of the real in the sense of intelligibility. Theory and Practice differ in their relationship to this entelechy, however. Peirce says:</page><page sequence="8">JOHN MICHAEL KROIS 23 Of thè two tasks of humanity, Theory and Practice, thè former sets out from a sign of a real object with which it is acquainted, passing from this, as its matter, to successive interprétants embodying more and more fully its form, wishing ultimately to reach a direct perception of thè entelechy; while thè latter, setting out from a sign signifying a character of which it has an idea, passes from this, as its form, to successive interprétants realizing more and more precisely its matter, hoping ultimately to be able to make a direct effort, producing thè entelechy (NE: IV, 240). I cannot enter here into a complete examination of this para- graph, which raises many questions, including how Peirce under- stands thè différence within Theory between thè naturai and hu- man sciences and how thè latter is related to "self-control" and, hence, to Practice. Instead, I want to take up Peirce's conception of Practice directly. In his work on speculative rhetoric as objective logic, Peirce claimed that thè very use of language - he emphasized in particu- lar thè asking of questions - necessarily aims at thè summum bo- numy thè establishment of "concrete reasonableness" (2.116). Asking questions is accessory to Theory. Is there already such a connection between semeiosis and thè summum bonum from thè Standpoint of Practice? Peirce defined thè object of both Theory and Practice as thè character of thè universe as a sign. From thè standpoint of Practice, however, this meant "setting out from a sign signifying a character of which it has an idea . . . hoping ultimately to be able to make a direct effort, producing thè en- telechy." This seems to lead to a view of Practice as arbitrary (not unlike thè notion in contract theory that thè state of nature is overcome on thè basis of a décision) since nothing is said about thè content of thè "idea" from which Practice is to begin, in order to make an effort that would produce thè entelechy. But this objection overlooks that Peirce understood Practice in terms of semeiosis. As he stated in "Some Conséquences of Four Inca- pacities," man confuses his will or brute force with his identity, thè consistency of what he does or thinks (5.315). Peirce traces this consistency of thought and action to man's ability to engage in semeiosis. Hence, unless thè "idea" that is to be realized in Practice is to be inconsistent with thè means of its realization, i.e., semeiosis, it must involve relegating brute force and arbi- trariness to thè perfection of semeiosis. The perfection of semeio- sis involves thè perfection of communication. Hence, thè idea to</page><page sequence="9">24 SPECULATIVE RHETORIC AND NATURAL LAW be realized in Practice would have to be one that thè members of a communication Community would decide upon through a pro- cess of communication. Peirce held that thè entelechy of being is to be a sign, thè "ideai sign." This, he said, "should be quite perfect, and so identical, - in such identity as a sign may have, - with thè very matter denoted united with thè very form signified by it" (NE: IV, 240). For Practice, this means that thè content of thè "idea" to be realized would be identical with thè form of its realization: a Community created by self-determination through communication by signs. II. 2. The Communication Community Contemporary German philosophers influencée] by Peirce have written detailed studies of thè problems I have been discussing, but they do not see their work explicitly in terms of Peirce's speculative rhetoric. Nevertheless, Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas have developed a "communicative ethics" which in many ways could be considered as a development of Peircean ideas in a field that Peirce himself left undeveloped: speculative rhetoric.22 I cannot offer an exposition of their positions hère, but by referring to some of their ideas I will show why and how semeiotic can contribute to thè theory of naturai law. Apel distinguishes between what he terms thè "actual" or "real" and thè "ideai" communication communities.23 The for- mer désignation refers to concrete existing communities com- posed of members who engage in argument in any form, meaning ali those who think, since thought is conceived hère as an internai dialogue. The latter désignation refers to an unlimited commu- nity which Apel says "would be in principle capable of ada- quately understanding the meaning of arguments and be able to definitely decide about their truth."24 "Argument" is a key term in Apel's conception of community. Argument is a way of mak- ing claims and, Apel stresses, it is only through communication that claims can be made. Making claims means assuming respon- sibility for them and at the same time making demands on others. AH of this requires explanation, but let it suffice to note that Apel agrées with Habermas that "Everyone who engages in com- munication at ail ... has to implicitly recognize that, since he cannot avoid making claims about truth or correetness, his ac- tions indicate to him that the only way to continue to act in terms</page><page sequence="10">JOHN MICHAEL KROIS 25 of a consensus, in thè event that these naively upheld and actu- ally accepted claims are called into question, is to engage in argumentation."25 Argument and ethics, therefore, are insépara- ble. In fact, thè grounds of thè validity of argument are thè grounds of thè validity of ethics. Habermas has sought to provide this foundation in his theory of "communicative compétence."26 Apel has criticized this approach, undertaken in analogy with Chomsky's linguistics, claiming that it is ultimately naturalistic since it rests upon an anthropological capacity.27 For Apel, argu- ment and ethics are based upon thè fcfcA priori of thè communica- tion Community," i.e., thè possible critique of thè ideal communi- cation Community or, to be more precise, thè ideal Community itself, not as a fact, but as thè anticipated ideai which makes our actions (arguments) rational and which, he argues, we therefore always assume in communication.28 Apel goes on to argue that thè différence between thè real and ideai communication commu- nities is important in founding an emancipatory interest in elimi- nating thè gap between these two.29 I cannot give a further account of ali this hère, but I do want to point out thè close affiliation between thè idea of thè communication community as an ideal and Peirce's conception of the object of Practice as the perfection of semeiosis. Beyond this, however, I believe that Peirce's speculative rhe- toric can make a special contribution to the discussion of the foundation of "communicative ethics." Communicative ethics is a social theory of ethics which can be understood in regard to the tradition of naturai law theory. It is immune, however, to some of thè severe criticisms which hâve been made over the years against naturai law theory. One basic criticism of naturai law theory was that the notion of the social contract, so prévalent in the eighteenth Century, reduced the validity of law to a mere instrument. Critics pointed out that law and society were thereby conceived to be wholly directed to the purpose of securing bene- fits to individuals, to the neglect of social purpose. This view was strongly upheld by Hegel, who proposed that philosophy must distinguish between such a "civil society" and thè idea of the state, which he took to be the true source of law's validity.311 Marx rejected Hegel's Idealist foundation for the philosophy of law, but upheld the criticism of contract theory, rejecting the eighteenth-century doctrine of human rights as a theory that is actually applicable to man only as an egoistic monad, on Marx s</page><page sequence="11">26 SPECULATIVE RHETORIC AND NATURAL LAW view. For him, such rights do not really stem from or apply to man as a species.31 Finally, Neo-positivists sought to reduce ali naturai law to positive law and argued by means of thè emotive theory of value that objective norms were mere fictions.32 Most recently, John Rawls has sought to revive contract theory, but even if we reject thè metaphysical basis of Hegel's Idealist cri- tique of contract theory it is evident that, as it stands, Rawls' position is clearly utilitarian.33 It is based, as he says, on thè theory of rational choice and Claims to show how human beings would form a society, if they could do so under ideai conditions.34 It is not normative, but instrumental in essence. Like all contract théories, Rawls' conception of thè "original position" présup- poses thè ability to reach an agreement, i.e., communication. Here is where Peirce's speculative rhetoric can contribute to thè discussion of thè foundation of thè norms propounded by naturai law théories, by showing thè final foundation of thè agreements envisioned by contract theory. Laws are proclaimed by those who have thè power to proclaim them in particular human societies. In such spécifie cases, law- giving has thè character of a speech act.35 Those to whom this law applies can be designated as thè audience in question. This model of law-giving might also be extended to thè sphère of naturai law if it were conceived in terms of Peirce's speculative rhetoric so that thè audience in question would be a universal audience. In line with Peirce's theory of thè catégories, it is possible to distin- guish among three sensés or forms of universal audience.36 1. The first form of universal audience is immediately given, at least in thè imagination. This is how Perelman, who made this term populär among rhetoricians, understands "universal audi- ence," as "thè whole of mankind, or at least, of ali normal aduli persons."37 It is actual and so it is thè rhetorical équivalent of Apel's concept of thè real communication Community, namely, its greatest extension. 2. The second form of universal audience is a corrolary of what Apel calls thè "ideai communication Community." It is thè possi- ble criticisms of this unlimited audience that we have in mind when we evaluate an argument and so it cannot be reduced to thè first universal audience because it, as something actual, cannot be conceived to represent thè true "court of appeal" in evaluating arguments. There are many embodiments throughout time of thè universal audience taken in thè first sensé, but there is only one</page><page sequence="12">JOHN MICHAEL KROIS 27 universal audience taken in thè second sensé, as an ideal. As an ideal it remains distinct, a "second," in comparison with the first form of universal audience. 3. The third form of universal audience médiates between the first and second and is a postulate of speculative rhetoric. In this sensé "universal audience" désignâtes the détermination of signs by other signs that would mediate between the real and ideal communication communities. Conceived in thèse terms, the uni- versal audience is a strictly semeiotic reality which is irreducible to the actual "universal" audience because it encompasses unlim- ited future semeiosis. This is the form of audience inhérent in Peirce's characterization in speculative rhetoric of semeiosis as objective logic. As I hâve already shown, this objective logic does not prescribe the actual course of the interprétation of signs in the sensé of necessitating that it hâve a particular content. But it does set limits beyond which this process can be regarded as only negating or contradicting itself. Hence, a categorical imperative of speculative rhetoric in the sensé of objective logic would be (to rephrase a guideline from Peirce's theory of inquiry) "Don't block the path of communication!" On the other hand, this form of universal audience is not an ideal in the sensé of something as yet unrealized because the unlimited process of semeiosis is not confined to the future. The détermination of signs by other signs as described by speculative rhetoric is, in fact, the final foundation and logicai basis for the ability to reach agreements that is presupposed by naturai law contract théories. Indeed, the communication com- munity that it founds is logically prior to any form of civil. society or state and so preempts the social contract as the basis of soci- ety. Speculative rhetoric establishes the "essential conditions" for the attainment of any consensus or the proclamation of any law. This is because semeiosis does not just mediate between the real and ideal communication communities; it is their origin and first principle. Semeiotic contributes to the theory of naturai law, therefore, by showing what the final foundation of naturai law is and providing a new theoretical approach to the theory of naturai law. In making this suggestion I realize that it is only a first step, and much of what I hâve presented needs still further clarifica- tion, including the nature of speculative rhetoric itself and its status as a science. Peirce describes it as a kind of formai science</page><page sequence="13">28 SPECULATIVE RHETORIC AND NATURAL LAW and appears to hâve conceived it as a kind of transcendental study.38 But if speculative rhetoric were to be further developed, then I believe that philosophy would have a theory of naturai law that would be immune to many of thè most serious criticisms that have been made against this doctrine since thè Enlightenment. Contract theory would then no longer be subject to thè Idealist crìticism that it is based upon no principle other than arbitrary will, because reaching a consensus is based upon thè nature of human society as a communication Community. Similarly, thè Marxian crìticism that thè naturai law doctrine of human rights is mistakenly based upon conceiving man as an individuai isolated from thè rest of thè species rather than on his social nature can be shown to be incorrect. On thè contrary, semeiotic shows that thè communication Community is prior to both thè state and civil society conceived as an association of individuai persons, and thè inherently social nature of communication is indisputable. Hu- man rights derived upon this basis apply to man as a species because, as Peirce put it "man is a sign" (5.314), meaning ali people, everywhere, at ali times.39 Finally, thè Neo-Positivistic réduction of thè origin of norms to individuai feelings must be recognized to be an illusion. Semeiosis is inherently intersubjec- tive and so cannot be reduced to émotions isolated in thè individ- uai as his feelings. By developing speculative rhetoric in thè way I have outlined, naturai law theory revitalizes thè Enlightenment ideai of society as a free self-determining community based upon public discus- sion and communication.

In a paper presented at the IASS congress in Vienna, July, 1979 Jarrett Brock refers to a passage where Peirce mentions assertions in conjunetion with speculative grammar (3.430). Taking this passage in its context, however, does not offer an argument for classifying the study of assertion there, rather than under speculative rhetoric, because Peirce is not referring to the act of assertion in that passage, but to the proposition contained therein. I6A complete analysis of this question would have to show how Peirce's and HegeFs conceptions of the relationships between "logic" and "signs" compare in their Systems, an extensive and key problem in understanding the so-called "lin- guistic turn" in contemporary philosophy. In this passage Peirce also asks whether this development is cyclic or if, in addition to this répétition, it is also historical. The idea that Peirce's semeiotic could contain a philosophy of history has yet to be explored. x*Semiotic and Signifies: The Correspondence between Charles S. Peirce and Victo- ria Lady Welby, ed.
