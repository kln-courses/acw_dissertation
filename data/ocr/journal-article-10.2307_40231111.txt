<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume IX, Number 3, September 1979 A Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions FREDERICK R. ADAMS, University of Wisconsin I The analysis of function-ascribing statements, such as "the function of x is y", is proving to be a difficult matter. It is difficult because we are only beginning to see the complexity which is involved in ascribing functions. The process of discovery has been slow and tedious, with each newly constructed analysis of the meaning of functional ascriptions yielding insights into the structure of functional analysis and functional explanation. However, as each analysis is, in turn, dismantled, we seem to see our insights slip away. In the wake of each exchange, a new member is added to the list of desiderata for an analysis of function-ascribing statements. Thus, the matter of finding a proper analysis of function attributions becomes more and more complex. Until now the traditional method of approach to an analysis of function attributions has been a higly intuitive one. A set of (intuitively) acceptable examples of function attributions are offered and an analysis is constructed to meet those examples. Counterexamples are then sought and found, and they force amended versions of the analysis. Since the amended analyses are modified in just those ways in which the counterexamples show deficiencies, they are left vulnerable to new counterexamples of a 493</page><page sequence="2">Frederick R. Adams different sort. The result of this approach has led to the complexity which we now find in functional analyses. Throughout the entire procedure, the putative counterexamples themselves must be accepted or rejected on purely intuitive grounds, with no clear agreement as to whether they should count as genuine cases of functional relations or not. This trial and error method may indeed be the best we can do. Nonetheless, it is appropriate to begin to search for a new approach. We may find help by reconsidering the foundation upon which function attributions rest, in hope of breaking new ground. It is this approach that shall guide the present investigation. II Let me begin by suggesting that the essential feature of a functional relationship is that of a means-ends relation.1 For a structure x to have a function y is, essentially, for x to do y in a system S and for y to lead to the fact that the system is able to output a value O.2 The output value O will either be a goal-state of S or causally contribute to S's attaining a goal-state. Let us schematically represent the means-ends relation of functional relations as follows: S X ► Y ►£ 1 My indebtedness to Nagel [9] and Cummins [5] will become apparent. 2 I should mention from the start that there is a certain transitivity in functional contexts. Given that the function of x is y and that y leads to z, we may be willing to accept the attribution that the function of x is z. If the function of the heart is to pump, and pumping leads to circulation, we would also accept the attribution of the function of circulating blood to the heart. There are numerous instances of this type. Just where the transitivity breaks down is unclear, although it may break down when we go from the extremes of function attributions at the macroscopic level of description to attributions of function at the microscopic level. 494</page><page sequence="3">Coal-State Theory of Function Attributions (Here, y either is O or is causally related to S's outputting O.) In S, x's doing y is the means by which S is able to do O. Hence x, y, and O stand in a means-ends nexus within the system S. If it is a function of chlorophyll in plants to aid in photosynthesis, then aiding in photosynthesis leads to the plant's manufacturing sugar (outputting O, if you will) which is an end-state or goal-state for the plant. Chlorophyll leads to the plant's being able to achieve one of its goal-states.3 While I am arguing for the position that functional relations are means-ends relations, I have added the condition that, in the means-ends relations which are functional relations, the end state reached is a goal-state for the system. The last condition must be included since not every means-ends relation is a functional relation. There are other means-ends relations in which structures and events stand to one other. Purely causal relations are sometimes thought of as means-ends relations. When a variable volume of gas is heated it expands. Its expanding is the means by which the gas maintains a constant temperature. So, for example, if one heats a ballon containing oxygen, it will expand. As it expands, its temperature will tend to remain constant. Maintainingconstanttemperaturewill bean end-state of the process of expansion ; yet, we do not want to say that it is a function (or the function, in the non-mathematical sense of "function") of the gas's expanding to keep the temperature of the gas constant. The reason that we do not is that it is simply not a goal-state of the volume of gas that it maintain a constant temperature. It is not directively organized toward that end, toward that goal.4 The expansion of the gas is not causally directed toward that end, it is merely terminated at that end-state. 3 Ordinarily we will say that it is the f u nction of x to do y (in S) if doing y actually leads to S's outputting O. However, O may be a goal-state for S even if it is never reached. Hitting the enemy ship in outer space may be a goal-state for the guided missile even if the missile misses the ship and zooms eternally through space. I should also point out that it has been argued by Achinstein [1] that it is confusing to say that if x does y and y contributes to S's ability to output O, that x's function is to contribute to the ability of S to output O. I think that we can avoid any confusion by casting the function attributions in the approp- riate conditional form. We will say that the function of x is y if, under appropriate conditions C, x would do y and y would lead to S's outputting O. 4 The expansion of the volume of gas contributes to its maintaining a constant temperature, but maintaining a constant temperature is not a goal-state of the gas. It is not a function of the volume of gas to expand, nor a function of its expansion to maintain constant temperature. 495</page><page sequence="4">Frederick R. Adams The goal-state theory of function attributions holds that the central feature of functional relations is not only that they are means-ends relations, but also that they are means-ends relations within or conjoined with goal-directed systems. In this way we can avoid attributing functions to non-functional causal relations. So, e.g., we can avoid attributing to the moon the function of making the tide come in and go out. Although this surely is an effect of the moon, it simply does not warrant an ascription of function. We must have a way to block such ascriptions, and wedding the ascription of functions to goal-directed systems provides the means to do so. The effect of the moon on the ebb and flow of the tides is not a functional relation since it is not part of a goal-directed system. Consider the contrast of the constricting action of the capillaries in the body. We say that it is a function of capillary constriction to limit the flow of blood to the outermost regions of the body, when the body is cold. The body is goal-directed toward homeostasis of temperature (roughly 98.6°F) and performs certain activities which are directed toward reaching its goal-state. Capillary constriction is one of these activities. The greatest potential for loss of body heat occurs when blood reaches the surface areas of the body, especially at the outermost regions, such as hands and feet. When our body temperature falls significantly below the optimum state (98.6°F) the capillaries constrict and prohibit the flow of blood to the surface areas. Thus, the opportunity for heat loss is reduced. When the goal-state of optimum temperature is reached, the constriction subsides. Here, we are clearly willing to attribute to the constricting action of the capillaries the function of limiting the flow of blood to the surface areas of the body. Limiting the flow of blood causally contributes to the body's achieving one of its goal-states, homeostasis of temperature. Contrast this with the tidal effects of the moon. Although they are regular effects of the moon's causal interaction with the oceans, the tides play no role in a goal-directed system. On the other hand, the constricting action of the capillaries plays a functional role in attaining a goal-state of the body. It is the added feature of contributing to the attainment of a goal-state that confers the status of a functional relation upon a means-end relation within a system. Since the goal-state theory of function attributions closely ties the concept of having a function to the concept of being goal-directed, it is imperative that we have at least a rough characterization of what it is to be a goal-directed system. While a complete and formal analysis of goal-directedness is well beyond the scope of this paper, (in section IV) I shall attempt to characterize the central features of what it is for a system to be goal-directed. In this way, we will have a firm foundation 4%</page><page sequence="5">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions for the goal-state theory of function attributions and enough information about the theory to assess its worth. Before I proceed, I would like to address the notion that to be goal-directed is essentially mentalistic. That is, it has been argued that the core concept of goal-directedness requires that, for a system to be goal-directed, it must have desires, beliefs and intentions.5 On this view, other systems may be said to be goal-directed, but only if they have internal states which are analogous to mental states, and then they are only said to be goal-directed by extension of the concept to non-mental systems. On such a view, whether non-mental systems (e.g., plants) are to count as goal-directed (e.g., in their tropic responses) will be a subjective matter - subject to our finding internal analogues to beliefs, desires, and intentions which we deem similar enough to mental states to warrant calling the systems goal-directed systems. Consequently, on this kind of goal-state theory of function attributions, whether a structure has a function will also be a purely subjective matter, if that structure occurs in a non-mental system. Structures in those systems will be attributed functions subject to our deciding to call the systems goal-directed. Perhaps artifacts which contributed to the desires of their artificers would be the only thing which could truly be said to have functions on such a view because the artificers would be the only systems which could truly be said to be goal directed. I believe, however, that this view should be adopted only as a last resort. I shall try to give an account of goal-directedness, and of something's having a function, such that whether something has a function or whether it occurs in a goal-directed system is an objective matter of fact. Anything less would make all talk of goal-directedness and of functions, at least with respect to non-mental systems, purely subjective. I shall claim that goal-directed systems can be either mental or non-mental systems. Beliefs, desires, and intentions are not required for a system to be goal-directed. Consequently, the difference between the two types of systems - when they are goal-directed - is that mental systems have beliefs, desires, and intentions as components in the causal network which produces their goal-directed behavior, while non-mental systems do not. In section IV, I shall explicate being goal-directed as being a kind of cybernetic system in which beliefs, desires, and intentions may play a causal role, but in which they are not necessary conditions. 5 Andrew Woodfield argues for this view in [13]. 497</page><page sequence="6">Frederick R. Adams Before I set out the version of the goal-state theory of function attributions which I am defending, it will help to examine some of the current theories of functional analysis. I will present them as possible candidates for the further specification of the precise conditions which govern the means-ends relationship of functional relations and suggest what I find acceptable and unacceptable about them. Then I will present an analysis of what it is for a system to be goal-directed and of what it is for something to have a function in a goal-directed system. Finally (section V), I will exhibit the manner in which this version of the view fends off putative counterexamples. Ill The view I am defending is to be distinguished from what has been called the ''good consequence view" of function attributions.6 The strongest version of that view is presented by Hempel7 and by Lehman.8 They require that there must be a benefit conferred upon a system before a function can be attributed to what produced the benefit. Further, the benefit must be one which is a necessary condition for the system's well-functioning.9 Let S = a containing system, X = a structure (or event) in S, Y = an effect of x, Y' = an effect of x, O = a necessary condition of S's well-functioning. According to this view, the function of x is y if and only if all three of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) x does y (in systems of kind S); (2) y is causally relevant to the satisfaction of O; (3) O is a necessary condition of S's well-functioning. Graphically, let us represent this as follows: 6 See Achinstein [1], where he characterizes the features of this view. 7 See [6]. 8 Cf. [7]. 9 See note 10. 498</page><page sequence="7">Coal-State Theory of Function Attributions S (The solid line indicates the causal and functional relation, while the broken line indicates a mere effect.) Hempel argues that we can identify functional relations by the fact that they lead to the satisfaction of necessary conditions of S's well-functioning. This allows us to exclude mere effects of x from the class of x's functions. His analysis is built around the following two statements: (1 ) The heartbeat in vertebrates has the function of circulating blood through the organism; (2) The heartbeat has the function of producing heart sounds (for the heartbeat has that effect). Hempel wants to be able to show why (1 ) is acceptable while (2) is not. (1) is acceptable because, in S (vertebrates), x(the heartbeat) doesy (circulates the blood) which contributes to S's doing some O (e.g., getting nutriment to the cells and carrying away waste) which is a necessary condition of S's well-functioning. Although Hemple's analysis is successful at distinguishing between (1 ) and (2), thereby blocking attributions of function to mere effects, it is still unsuccessful as an analysis. It falls prey to other difficulties. First, it is not clear that the conditions Hempel gives are sufficient conditions for function attributions. His analysis cannot handle what I shall call the problem of "fortuitous effects." Imagine that I am a soldier in a combat area and my chaplain has given me a small pocket version of the Bible. If I carry the Bible in my shirt pocket, while on patrol, there is a good chance that the Bible would stop a small caliber bullet from entering my chest. Given that this does happen one day, during a brief exchange of fire, I may take it as being of religious significance. That the Bible saved my life may be interpreted by me (and by the chaplain) as a sign of Cod's watching over me. Suppose I then give the Bible to a friend of mine, doubting seriously that it could ever save me more than once, but thinking that it could instill faith in my friend. Given that the enemy has expert marksmen, they will shoot for the chest (a point of vulnerability), with 499</page><page sequence="8">Frederick R. Adams a high degree of success. Since my friend is carrying the Bible (purely for spiritual reasons, not for physical protection) in his shirt pocket, it is not too unlikely that the chain of events which happened to me could occur again. If they do, my friend may also pass the Bible on and the chain may continue. Then Hempel's conditions are met: (1) the Bible stops the bullets from entering the bodies of soldiers, (2) stopping the bullets is causally relevant to keeping them from entering the bodies of the soldiers, (3) non-entry is a necessary condition for the well-functioning of the soldiers as soldiers - and for the well-functioning of their bodies as human beings. Although the conditions are met, it is not the or even a function of the Bible to stop bullets. In fact, the soldiers did not carry the Bible with that intent, but for religious reasons. The Bible produces fortuitous effects, but it does not get ascribed the function of a bullet deflector (shield). Therefore, Hempel's conditions may not be sufficient conditions for attributing functions. Second, it is doubtful that Hempel has given necessary conditions for attributing functions; his conditions are too strong. Hempel focuses his attention narrowly upon vital functions and the means-ends relationships which are vital to the existence or well-functioning of a system. In an effort to loosen the restriction that all functional relationships are vital ones, let us try to find functional relations which meet the following conditions: (1) x does y in systems of kind S; (2) y is causally relevant to the satisfaction of conditions for the output O; (3) O is a goal-state of S but is not a necessary condition of S's well-functioning. We are sometimes consciously goal-directed towards carrying pens by affixing them to our pockets. We have an internal representation of that goal-state (an idea, if you will) and we clip the pen into place. The clip holds the pen in place and being held in place contributes to our goal-state of transporting the pen in our pocket. However, it can hardly be said that carrying pens in our pockets, in this manner, is a necessary condition of our well-functioning. After all, some pens do not have such clips; we simply find other ways to transport them. Having the pens fixed securely in our pockets is a convenience and leads to a goal-state, but it is not a necessary condition of our well-functioning. Nonetheless, it is the function of the clips to affix the pens to our pockets. 500</page><page sequence="9">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions Since most examples of artifacts and their functions will meet the same conditions, Hempel's analysis is too strong to be taken as giving necessary conditions for ascribing functions. Notice that it will not do to try to salvage Hempel's analysis by stipulating conditions of well-functioning so that, say, one is not well-functioning as a salesperson unless he has an abundant supply of pens clipped into an easily accessible pocket. The analysis would then become true by ingenuity of example or by stipulation of conditions of well-functioning.10 If we agree that Hempel's requirement is too strong, we may weaken it and still hold a version of the good-consequence view. For instance, we may say that for x to have y as a function: (1) x must be able to do y (in S); (2) y must confer some benefit or advantage upon S. Various formulations of this weaker version exist. For example, y may contribute to the well-functioning of S - without contributing to a necessary condition of S's well-functioning. Or, x's doing y may contribute something useful to S.11 X may do y and y may contribute to an adaptive advantage of S.12 Each of these versions of the view fail. They all face the problem of fortuitous effects. But even if we modify the view to handle that difficulty by changing it to read as follows: (1) x must be able to do y (in S); (2) y must lead to S's outputting O (in a non-accidental way); (3) O must be a goal-state of S; 10 We must avoid circularity. In order for y to be the function of x, y must be causally relevant to the satisfaction of a necessary condition of S's well- functioning, according to Hempel. When is Swell-functioning? We cannot say that, e.g., the function of the clip is to enable the pen to be affixed to a pocket because being so affixed is a necessary condition of one's well- functioning. If we merely stipulate that one is only well-functioning when he has a pen clipped into his pocket, we are open to the charge of circularity. 11 See Canfield [3]. 12 This view is developed by Ruse [10]. 501</page><page sequence="10">Frederick R. Adams (4) O must confer a good on S; it is still not satisfactory. Once it is clear that functional relations are, at heart; means-ends relations in goal-directed systems, then it is not important that the goal-states be good for S. A functional relation is a means-ends relation for achieving the goal-state; and no more. Salmon swim upstream to spawn, after which they die. They are goal-directed towards spawning and swimming upstream has the function of returning the salmon to their spawning beds. Swimming upstream contributes to their eventual spawning. Hence, conditions (1)-(3) are met. Yet, spawning confers no benefit upon the particular fishes which spawn. Perhaps it contributes a benefit, at the level of species, upon the kind of fish salmon are. But, without making this move, it is still intuitively clear that the function of swimming upstream is to get them to their spawning beds (and eventually to spawning).13 Also, people very often employ devices which have destructive functions. Even if their conscious goal-state is one of destruction, the structures which enter into the appropriate means-ends relations contributing to that goal will be said to have functions in the system. The point is that the essential feature of functional relations is that structures or events contribute to the goal-states via the appropriate causal route (I will argue that it must go through the feedback loop of a cybernetic system). It is not important that the goal-states reached be good ones - although the majority of functional relations will confer benefits upon the systems in which they occur. (In fact, in order to explain how the goal-directed systems evolved we must assume that some adaptive advantages will occur.) So, both versions of the good-consequence view (strong and weak) fail. They fail because it is false that the goal-states reached by functional relations must be good ones. In addition to the good-consequence views of functional relations, we should look at Nagel's version of the relation - Nagel's was, perhaps, the first formulation of the goal-state view. Rather than look at the role x's effect plays in S -whether or not it leads to a good consequence - Nagel suggests that we pay specific attention to the conditions under which an event y can come about in S. (Remember that y may be identical with output O.) Nagel argues that the analysis of "the function of x is y" is the following reformulation: 13 It is a very interesting question whether activities like the spawning of salmon only have a function at the level of species or whether they also have at the level of individuals. For more on this see [12]. I shall not deal further with this question here. 502</page><page sequence="11">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions (1) x is necessary for y (in S); (2) y contributes to output O of S; (3) O is a goal-state of S. (Schematically, Nagel's view can be represented by the figure on p. 494 above.) The difference between Nagel's view and Hempel's is that Nagel tries to make it possible for the presence of x to be necessary for y (under the conditions which actually obtain). Also, he requires only that y contribute to a goal-state of S, not that it is a necessary condition of S's well-functioning. Nagel focuses special attention upon the kind of thing x is. This is partly because he is searching for a connection between structure and function, and partly because he wants to be able to explain the presence of x in S. Nagel believes that functional explanation, if it is to explain anything, must explain the presence of x in S. It is for this reason that he makes x a necessary condition fory in S (condition (1)). I shall not rehearse past arguments for why making x a necessary condition for y will not succeed. Hempel14 and Cummins15 have adequately detailed why the D-N model for functional explanation fails. Let it suffice to say that as long as there are functional equivalents, one cannot deduce the presence of one rather than another of those equivalents (in S). Nagel notices that, in a system S, a structure x may not be logically necessary for y; it may not even be physically necessary. He claims, however, that given an inventory of the components of S which are actually present, we will find that it is only x which can do y. Hence x is, as a matter of fact, necessary fory. He suggests, e.g., that although a substance other than chlorophyll may be able to aid in plant photosynthesis, given the present genetic constitution of plants, chlorophyll is a necessary condition for photosynthesis. I shall not dispute the empirical facts about chlorophyll; instead I shall argue that we could ascribe to x the function y even if x were not necessary for y. To make this clear, let us construct the following scheme for a goal-directed system S. 14 See Hempel's [6]. 15 Cummins presents this very nicely in [5]. 503</page><page sequence="12">Frederick R. Adams S ^^^X Y ^O. We will build S so that not only x but x' also does y. Whether x and x' do y alternately, as in the case of a fall-back mechanism, or whether they do y simultaneously is of little consequence. However, let us suppose that they bring about y simultaneously. I want to maintain that if we have constructed the system properly it is a function of x to do y. I also wish to maintain that it is a function of x' to do y. Since we will suppose that x and x' are different kinds of mechanisms, it is false that x is necessary for y. It is also false that x' is necessary for y. Yet we can ascribe to both a function to do y. If I am correct, then Nagel's condition (1 ) is too strong. Even if chlorophyll were not necessary for photosynthesis that could still be its function. It is not a necessary condition for attributing a function to x that x be uniquely necessary for y. There are many examples of fall-back mechanisms in biology which sharpen this point. For instance, it is my understanding that it may be a function of both the thyroid glands and of the adrenal glands to preserve internal body temperature by the secretion of hormones which regulate the heartbeat, constriction of the blood vessels, etc.16 I am sure there are other cases to be added. Both the kidneys and the process of sweating remove excess water from the body, and both can operate at the same time. If there are genuine cases which fit the scheme above - and I have suggested that there are - then whether the cases are from biology, or of artifacts, they force us to revise Nagel's conditions. If we do not withhold a functional attribution to a structure in a system simply because other structures contemporaneously have that function, then we must weaken Nagel's condition (1). One may attempt to block my counterexamples to Nagel's analysis by arguing that when a structure x does y and a fall-back mechanism x' does y, there are really two systems involved. That is, there is the system in which x is a part and the system in which x' is a part.17 In each of these systems, it would be argued, the structure is a necessary condition for 16 These examples can be found in Cannon's [4], chapter 12. 17 In fact, Nagel comes very close to arguing this in [8], pp. 292 ff. 504</page><page sequence="13">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions y, so condition (1) is salvaged. It seems that the mistake which belies this type of argument is that the system in which x and x' occur is the same. The fact that a fall-back system kicks in may change the relation between the parts of S, but it does not make S a different kind of system. In the next section I shall argue for the following formulation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for function attributions: (1) InS, xdoesy; (2) y causally contributes to output O of S (through the feedback loop in S); (3) O is a goal-state of S (where S is a goal-directed system). IV I shall contend that a goal-directed system - whether mental or non-mental - is a cybernetic system. It is a cybernetic system in the sense that its behavior is not mere random behavior which accidentally terminates in an end state. Rather, its behavior is controlled or directed towards an end state or goal-state. The system must also be able to process information about its present state (both internal and external state variables) and it must be able to compare that information with its goal-state. The system then performs a set of operations which minimize the difference between the present state and the goal-state. In order to be able to compare information about its present state with a goal-state, the system must have an internal representation of the goal-state. Hence to be truly directed by a goal, and not merely uncontrolledly approaching an end-state, a system must have both an internal representation of a goal-state and a feedback system which conveys information about its present state, and its output values, back into the system as inputs. That information is then causally efficacious in the system's performing successive operations which lead to its goal-state. That is, the successive outputs of the system causally depend upon the information about the output which is fed back as input information. The notion of feedback is not merely that the information is contained in the system, nor that there is a mere mathematical one-to-one correlation of what happens at the output of the system 505</page><page sequence="14">Frederick R. Adams with what happens at the input of the system. It is crucial that there is a causal dependence between the information about the system's outputs and the successive adaptations in the system's performance. Otherwise, any equilibrium system would count as a cybernetic system, e.g., a pendulum's coming to rest, a rock's rolling down a hill, water's reaching the lowest point, etc. An analysis of goal-directed ness which is based on a cybernetic account maintains that a system must have: (1) an internal representation of the goal-state; (2) a feedback system by which information about the system's state variables and its output values are fed back into the system as input values; (3) a causal dependence between the information which is fed back into the system and the system's performance of successive operations which minimize the difference bet- ween the present state of the system and its goal-state.18 If any of these conditions are missing the system may behave similarly to a goal-directed system but not be one, not be a cybernetic system and not be a goal-directed system, according to this view. Perhaps the simplest cybernetic system which is also a goal-directed system is a heating system which includes a thermostat that regulates the temperature in the home. \^J Heater ^- ► Feedback Loop 18 There must be restrictions placed upon what can count as a representation of a goal-state. Not just any one-to-one correlation will do. There must be an appropriate etiology for the internal state to come to represent the goal. I am assuming that there must be a causal theory of representation which will give the exact conditions under which an internal state will represent a goal-state. - See Stampers [11], for the beginnings of such a theory. 506</page><page sequence="15">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions The thermostat must be carefully calibrated so that the relation of its internal structure and position accurately represents various room temperatures. When we set the thermostat at 65°, the position of the dial becomes an internal representation of the goal-state of 65° room temperature. As the room temperature falls below 65°, the circuit to the heater is closed and the system outputs heat. So that the room temperature will not go far above 65° once the heater is activated nor fall very far below 65° after the circuit is re-opened, the system must be capable of monitoring the temperature in the room. If the room reaches its goal-state the circuit opens; if it does not it remains closed and the heater continues to output heat. In either case, the effect of the output values on the system is monitored and fed back into the system as input. The input information is compared with the goal-state, as represented in the position of the thermostat, and successive operations are performed to minimize the difference. As long as the system is in proper working order, whether the heater comes on, continues to run, or shuts off, depends upon the information about the temperature of the room that is fed back as input into the system. It is this closed feedback loop which is the central feature of a cybernetic system. And, it is the information feedback system plus an internal representation of a goal-state which are the central features of a goal-directed system. There are many goal-directed sub-systems which operate in living systems. In complex living systems it is no doubt the central nervous system which contains the internal representations of the goal-states and which processes information which is fed back into the system. For instance, the body is goal-directed toward homeostasis of temperature. Some feature of the autonomic nervous system contains an internal representation of the optimum body temperature; a goal-state for the system. When the state of the system falls below the optimum temperature, the mechanisms of capillary constriction, secretion of adrenalin, etc., begin to function. Their output values causally contribute to the reduction of the difference between the present state of the system and its goal-state. Once the goal-state is reached these mechanisms subside. Or, if the temperature of the system exceeds the goal-state, then cooling mechanisms begin to function, e.g., sweating etc. It is the informational dependency between output values and input values of the system which enable the goal-state to be reached and maintained. Without it, it would be a lucky accident when our bodies reached the optimum temperature for proper functioning. (Of course, we are also conscious cybernetic systems. We know that we must maintain a certain body temperature and we perform the appropriate successive operations of putting on and peeling off 507</page><page sequence="16">Frederick R. Adams layers of clothing. The same criteria for goal-directedness apply for these consciously goal-directed actions.) With this understanding of goal-directedness, let me now re-state the central tenet of the goal-state theory of function attributions. A structure x has a function yjust in case: (1) x does y in system S; (2) y causally contributes towards S's outputting O (through the causal feedback mechanism); (3) O is (or itself contributes toward) a goal-state of S. Since it is clear that x must be part of a cybernetic system S - and S must also be goal-directed - we can graphically represent the functional relation between structures and goal-states as follows. S aX ^Y ►(} Feedback Loop (The addition of the feedback loop will block attributions to effects of structures in S which are merely fortuitous, and not truly functions. The importance of this will become clear in what follows.) Only when a system S is a goal-directed system can the means-ends relation which is central to functional relations be instantiated. It is true that we appear to attribute functions to structures that occur in systems which are not goal-directed. To account for this fact I will adopt the view that it is only in conjunction with a goal-directed system that it is correct to ascribe functions to non-directed systems, e.g., to non-goal-directed artifacts. So, for instance, it would not be a function of the clips on pens to enable them to attach to pockets or lapels if there were no goal-directed systems for which this was a goal-state. It would not be their function because they would not stand in the means-ends relationship of the required sort. This is not to say that the clips would not give the pens 508</page><page sequence="17">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions the capacity to be affixed to pockets; they would. It is true that a function of the clips would be to affix pens to pockets, were they to occur in a means-ends relation to a goal-directed system. They would simply not actually have that function if they were not actually associated with a goal-directed system in the appropriate way.19 What I wish to capture is the intuition that, e.g., although a rock may come to hold papers in place on a desk, it is only in virtue of being conjoined with a goal-directed system - Smith - that the rock comes to acquire this function. It is not true of rocks, in general, that one can attribute to them the function of holding papers in place, even though they have that capacity. Further, even if the rock comes to be associated with Smith, it must instantiate the appropriate means-ends relation through the feedback loop to acquire a function. Smith must have an internal representation of a goal-state (say, an idea of holding papers in place on his desk). If this is a consciously held goal-state, it is simply an idea or desire of Smith's. He then performs successive operations which will tend to minimize the difference between the present state of his desk and the goal-state. He picks out a rock and places it on his desk. If it produces effects which achieve the goal-state, that information will be fed back into Smith's information processing system. That is, Smith will be able to tell whether or not the rock makes a good paperweight. If it does, that information will causally contribute to the rock's successive states. For instance, if it works, Smith will continue to use it. If it is too small, that information will be fed back and Smith will set out in search of a new one which is a bit larger. In any event, the system consisting of Smith plus the rock must be a goal-directed system - which Smith is. The rock becomes an artifactual extension of Smith. Also, the conditions for ascribing a function to the rock must be met - and they will be met if the rock makes an efficient paperweight. It is important to note that the conditions for a system's being goal-directed and for a structure's having a function must both be met. Otherwise, if a rock just happened to be thrown on Smith's desk and just happened to hold paper on his desk when a gust of wind blew in the office, we would still not ascribe to the rock the function of holding papers in place. The reason we would withhold the attribution is that the rock does not, as yet, instantiate a functional 19 When I say "in the appropriate way" I mean through the feedback loop. Also, I do not want to become embroiled in a controversy ofwhether, inS,xhasa function actually or only potentially. It seems that by recasting function attributions in the subjunctive, when necessary, we will resolve this prob- lem. See note 3. 509</page><page sequence="18">Frederick R. Adams relation. It may fortuitously cause one of Smith's goal-states to be reached (while he was out buying a paperweight). Yet, it did not enter into the appropriate means-ends relation in the appropriate way for it to have a function. It must enter into the causal relations in the feedback loop of a goal-directed system for it to attain a function. This it can do when, upon returning from an unsuccessful search for a paperweight, Smith finds that the rock will serve that role and he so employs it. Its continuing to hold papers in the future will be causally dependent upon its success at holding them in the past. This view is not to be thought anthropomorphic. If a group of cleverly constructed robots have, as goal-states, affixing pens with clips to their lapels, then the function of the clips can become to so affix the pens. The robots need not be like us in any other way than that they be goal-directed systems and that they employ the pens with the clips in the appropriate way. In fact, any structure which is conjoined with any kind of goal-directed system, through the feedback loop, can acquire a function. The goal-directed system need not be like us. For instance, in the household heat thermostat, the function of the mercury switch is to turn the furnace off and on with respect to the set temperature for the room. Yet, the goal-directed system is scarcely like us in any other respect than that it is a cybernetic system and that it is a goal-directed system. I have, roughly, assumed that it is possible to construct a global theory of function attributions; a theory which covers attributions to both natural systems and to artifacts. If I am wrong, then the goal-state theory of function attributions may be of only limited scope, i.e., apply to natural systems but not to artifacts - or vice versa. However, at the outset, it is a worthwhile attempt to con struct a global theory which applies to both. Let me summarize the reasons which move me towards the goal-state view. Since I am arguing that the primary feature of functional relations is their being means-ends relations, I want to guard against the objection that in a system (even if it is a goal-directed system) any means-ends relation establishes a function. This view, or a similar variant, has been held by Cummins.20 He claims that x has the function y when: (1) xdoesy(inS); (2) y contributes to some capacity of S (i.e., contributes to S's ability to output O, if you will). 20 Cf. [5]. 510</page><page sequence="19">uoa/orare / neory or runcuon /Miriounons I wish to block this formulation since it lets in too much. It makes it possible to argue than any effect of x that we select may be one of x's functions. One can claim that no matter which effect of x we choose, there must be some capacity of S to which that effect contributes - regardless of how trivial or uninteresting. Thus, it is a function of x to do any and all of its effects. This is surely unacceptable. Some of the outputs O of S will not be goal-states of S. Why should we wish to say there there is a functional relation, a means-ends relation, between x and O when O is not a goal-state of S? Having a liver may lead to the capacity of S to acquire cirrhosis, but surely that is not a goal-state of S. We would, I think, not admit that the relation in which the liver stands to cirrhosis is a functional relation.21 I think we should not agree that it is a function of x in S to do whatever x can do. By adopting the goal-state view, we have a way to block attributions to mere effects. We should also avoid attributing functions to structures which accidentally produce fortuitous effects. We saw how to block an attribution of function to the rock which accidentally fell on Smith's desk. I argued there that even if it is a good for a system S, that y occur, or if y accidentally leads to a goal-state of S, if x accidentally occurs, producing y, we should not automatically be willing to attribute the function y to x. X must enter into the appropriate means-ends relation in a goal-directed system - i.e., it must be part of the causal chain involved in the feedback loop of the goal-directed system. Even in a natural system like the body, if a brain tumor accidentally places pressure upon the pituitary gland (which had been malfunctioning), thereby causing it to secrete the proper amount of hormones in the proportions required for normal development, we will not want to attribute to the brain tumor the function of applying pressure to the pituitary gland. From the mere fact that, in S, x produces y and y leads to some intrinsic or extrinsic good, a benefit to S, it does not follow that it is the function of x to do y. The brain tumor simply does not instantiate the means-ends relation in the appropriate way in order to warrant the attribution of a 21 Lehman [7] adds a condition to his analysis to block this move, but it is unsuccessful. He says that if x's doing y is sufficient to cause S to malfunc- tion, then doing y cannot be a function of x. Although this blocks the attribution of a function of contributing to cirrhosis to the liver, there are still problems. Constructing buildings with metal structures contributes to the capacity of the buildings to give off radiation. This does not cause the building to malfunction, yet it is also not a function of the metal structures to give off radiation, at least not prima facie. 511</page><page sequence="20">Frederick R. Adams function. The tumor would continue to apply pressure to the pituitary gland independently of the fact that its doing so conferred a benefit upon the body. Even if a structure or event provides a fortuitous effect in a system, more than a good consequence is required for something to acquire a function in a system. There must be a causal dependency between a structure's minimizing the difference between its goal-state and its present state (whether or not the goal-state is agood one), and the structures continuing to perform its operations.22 V In this section I will present putative objections to the view I am defending and attempt to defend the view against them. In this way we will be able both to make the view more perspicuous and, at the same time, to examine how well it can fend off attempted counterexamples. If the goal-state view can handle all of the objections that other views can and not fall prey to new ones, I shall rest fairly content with the view. Objection #7. Is it not true that what confers a function upon something is that it was selected for one or more of its properties? In the case of biological organisms, it may be argued that what confers upon x the function y is that, in S, x has been selected for doing y (through the processes of natural selection). With respect to artifacts, it may be claimed that it is we who select a structure x for its ability to do y. In either case it is through the processes of selection that functions are determined.23 Let me begin by addressing this view with regard to artifacts. It seems that one's intentions (i.e., the fact that one selects x for y) are neither necessary nor sufficient for x's having the function y. If I build a system S and include x, intending for x to do y (selecting x for y), that is not sufficient for x's doing y. Unbeknownst to me x may not be able 22 This type of examples shows what is wrong with assigning an attribution of function solely on the basis of fortuitous effects. Cf. Achinstein's treatment of the problem in [1]. 23 This view can be found in several places. Wright displays the attitude on occasion ([14] pp. 146ff.), and Achinstein builds an argument for the notion of ''design functions" ([1] pp. 350ff.). Also cf. Ruse [10]. 512</page><page sequence="21">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions to do y. If I build windshield wipersout of cardboard, it is not suffi- cient that I selected them for their ability to clean windshields, that they have that function. If they cannot enter into the means-ends nexus in virtue of which my car outputs O (cleans the windshield in the driving rain), then that is not their function. They do not actually have that function since they cannot actually deliver. I would cer- tainly discontinue using them when they disintegrated in the first rain storm. We could distinguish between the actual functions a thing has and the intended functions it has (which it never can actually perform).24 We might think that intended functions are a category of functions and that a thing may have intended functions in addition to what actual functions it has. However, my own inclination is to think that intended functions are in the class oi intentions, not in the class of functions. If something is to have a function it must be able to stand in a means-ends relationship of the required sort. It must be able to perform that function. Merely intending that it perform the function is not sufficient. As for whether intentions are necessary conditions: it is a bit harder to show that they are not. It is undeniably true that for most, if not all, human artifacts the intention of a designer or, at least, of the user of the artifact, is an element in the causal chain which leads to their acquiring functions. This is due to the fact that we are the kinds of goal-directed systems which have desires and intentions as inter- nal representations of goal-states. (We are mental systems.) It is not clear, however, that all goal-directed systems must be like us. Con- sider various animal species which employ artifacts as tools. For instance, otters use rocks to crack the shells of clams. The fact that we can freely attribute to their use of the rocks the function of cracking shells, without speculating as to whether or not they have intentions, is an indication that consciously intending that x do y may not be a necessary condition of x's acquiring the function y. Goal-directed systems may, at some stage in the biological chain, not be complex enough to have intentions. If they still employ artifacts, then clearly intentions would not be necessary conditions for the artifacts to acquire functions. I think that the same objections hold, mutatis mutandis, for biological functions. The fact that a structure was selected for doing y does not determine that doing y is its sole function. A structure x may have been selected for doing y and acquire a new function y'. Con- 24 SeeAchinstein[1]. 513</page><page sequence="22">Frederick R. Adams sider the behavioral pattern of pearlfishes. They adapted the be- havior of living in the respiratory system of the sea cucumber. They emerge at night and feed, and return to their hosts in the day. This pattern of behavior seems to have been selected for a defense against predators. However, it has led to the degeneration of the fishes' mechanisms to defend against light radiation. Their eyes have re- duced and their integumentary pigments, as well as other defenses, have been lost.25 It has now become a function of the behavior pattern of the pearlfish to inhabit their hosts to avoid light radiation. Although the behavior pattern was originally selected for defense from predators, it has now acquired another function. Hence, selec- tion processes are not necessary conditions of function acquisition. As long as the appropriate means-ends relation to a goal-state is instantiated an attribution of function is warranted. (Of course, the dependency upon the feedback information must also be satisfied.) To see that selection processes are not sufficient for attribution of function, think of the vestigal organs which have lost their functions - such as the appendix. A theory of function attributions based upon selection processes is very close to the goal-state view. It is close since the feedback mechanism of the goal-state theory will include both intentions and desires in the description of the conscious design of artifacts (where appropriate). It will also include selection processes in the descrip- tion of the causal feedback loop which leads to the acquisition of biological functions. However, a theory of function attributions based purely on selection processes would be too restrictive and it is this feature which I have tried to capture in the reasons which I have cited for rejecting the theory.26 Objection #Z Someone will no doubt object to the goal-state view in the following way: "Surely there must be cases where x does y, in S, and y leads to S's outputting O, but O is not a goal-state for S and we still attribute to x the function y." For instance, it seems perfectly all right to attribute to the ozone layer the function of filtering radiation. In order to handle such attributions, one must either show that there is a goal-directed system, e.g., the biosphere, for which this is a goal-state, or claim that properly tutored intuitions would reject such attributions. I shall take the latter route. Why does it not sound odd to attribute to the ozone layer the function of filtering radiation? It may 25 Cf. Williams [12] pp. 266-67. 26 See Nagel's arguments against selection theory as determining the functions of biological features [8]. 514</page><page sequence="23">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions be that we find the attribution of functions to items like the ozone layer plausible because we are influenced by its effects on goal- directed systems like ourselves. After all, the ozone layer's filtering radiation certainly contributes to the goal-states of survival and re- production in biological systems. It may be this conjunction with goal-directed systems which makes function attributions of this sort appealing. Would we, e.g., find the ascription plausible if there were an ozone layer around Pluto and we knew that there were no goal- directed biological systems on Pluto? If not, I suggest it is only due to the connection between the ozone layer's filtering radiation, and our reaching certain goal-states, which lends plausibility to such attribu- tions. Since there is no causal dependency - in a goal-directed System - between the filtering and our reaching certain goal-states, we may (when intuitions are tutored) come to withhold attributions of this kind. Objection #3. In some systems there will be parts, structures, to which we ascribe functions which do not depend on a feedback circuit for their continuing to perform their operations. Does that not show that to ascribe a function to a structure does not require that the structure would not be performing its operation if it were not part of a causal feedback loop? In a heating system the sensor which monitors the room temperature would continue to perform its function even if it were not in a goal-directed system, not in the feedback loop of the heating system. That is, if its function is to monitor room tempera- ture, it would have this function independently of occurring in a feedback system. In one sense, I would deny that a bimetallic strip or a container of mercury would have the function, independently of any goal- directed system, of monitoring the room temperature. Any ther- mometric device only acquires its function as a thermometer by being conjoined with a goal-directed system which employs the device. It is true that the expansion and contraction of a container of mercury is not dependent upon its being conjoined with a goal- directed system. It is false, however, that the expansion and contrac- tion of the mercury can play a functional role without being con- joined with a goal-directed system. So, initially, the sensor in the heating system only acquires its type of function by going through the feedback loop of the heating engineer. After the sensor is installed in the system, the fact that it can continue to perform its function (registering temperature) indepen- dently of a feedback circuit (that the thermometer continues to pro- cess information independently of the output of the heater) requires us to modify our analysis. Once a system acquires a function, it may be necessary to ascribe functions to structures within that system as 515</page><page sequence="24">Frederick R. Adams acquired functions. First the syst em acquires its function by having at least some of the components of the system meet the conditions of the analysis, then other parts of the system may acquire functions derivatively by virtue of the role they play. The mercury switch ac- quires the function of a sensor, derivatively, by the role it plays in the heating system. But the crucial first step in the heating system's acquisition of a function is that the system would not output heat if it were not for the feedback loop in the control system. Objection #4. There is a certain amount of intensionality involved when we make function attributions. The goal-state view of functions cannot capture this intensionality since if the function of x is to do y and y leads to output O, then when y = y', y' will lead to output O, but it may be false that the function of x is to do y'. If we build a pattern recognition computer and we want the computer to detect letters of the alphabet (output O) and we install a particular feature detector for each letter (where x is a feature detector), then the function of the detector x may be to detect the letter Q (which activity is y). Yet, we know that the letter Q is the seventeenth letter of our alphabet and it is false that the function of the feature detector is to detect the seventeenth letter of our alphabet.27 The goal-state theory must be able to explain why (1) (1) The function of the feature detector is to detect Qs is true, while (2) (2) The function of the feature detector is to detect the seventeenth letter of the alphabet is a false attribution. Let us assume that we build this device so that it detects Qs by analyzing their physical configurations. When this is so, we will say that (2) is false because, although it is undeniably true that if the device detects a Q it detects the seventeenth letter of the alphabet, it is notinvirtueofaQ's being the seventeenth letter of the alphabet that the device detects it. Rather, it is in virtue of a Q's having the physical configuration which it does that the device de- tects it. That is, we have set up the mechanism so that it is the event of an item's having the physical configuration of a Q (its being a Q) that triggers the mechanism and not the item's being the seventeenth member of a series. It is the event of the Q's having the physical 27 This example was suggested to me by Fred Dretske. 516</page><page sequence="25">Goal-State Theory of Function Attributions configuration it does which causes the mechanism (given its internal configuration) to detect and output a "Q" when shown a Q. We can show how to explicate the intensional nature of functional contexts in this way without making explicit use of the fact that function attributions are only applied to goal-directed systems. This is clear in the above case, but let us also examine a case where we need to appeal to the goal of a system. If (3) (3) The function of the heart is to circulate the blood is true and it is also true that circulation of blood is Harvey's favorite bodily function, it does not follow that (4) (4) The function of the heart is to perform Harvey's favorite bodily function is true. (And (4) seems false even though when the heart circulates the blood it does perform Harvey's favorite function.) We can handle the latter case by maintaining that if the heart has the function of circulating the blood, then circulation causally contri- butes to an output O for which the system is directively organized. Let us suppose that output O is identical to the process of carrying nutriment to the cells and removing wastes. Then, it is in virtue of some property P, of circulation, that this process is able to be carried out. However, that property is not the property of being Harvey's favorite bodily function, F. For F is not of the sort which could enter into the appropriate means-ends (causal)relation with respect to out- put O. Being Harvey's favorite bodily function is notcausally relevant to the circulation of the blood's being able to carry nutriment to the cells and remove wastes. Thus, we cannot accept (4) as a true function attribution. This example shows that we can account for the inten- sionality of functional contexts where we have substitution of codesignating terms for y in statement of the form "the function of x is y." We can do it simply by detailing the intensionality of the causal relations involved. In this way we explicate how the intensionality of functional contexts can readily be assimilated to the intensionality of causal contexts. Understood in this way, intensionality poses no special problem for the goal-state theory of function attributions.28 August 1978 28 I wish to thank Berent Enc, Fred Dretske, and Elliott Sober for many helpful discussions and suggestions which influenced my treatment of function attributions. 517</page><page sequence="26">Frederick R.
