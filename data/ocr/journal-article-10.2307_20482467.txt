ISBN: 978-0-415-30503-7. doi: 1.10 1I7/S0009840X07003034 This book is an addition to Routledge's series on gods and heroes of the ancient world. Each volume focusses on one particular god or hero and seeks to gather together different kinds of evidence concerning its subject. Owing to the abundance of material, Zeus is a more difficult undertaking than most. On the whole D. executes this task admirably: there is a wealth of information in this slim volume, which is an excellent resource for the study of Zeus and a good starting point for research into questions of Greek religion from a wide range of angles. Cult is prioritised (p. 17), but much detail from the worlds of myth and art is incorporated. Of course, in selecting what to include and what to exclude when the subject matter is so vast is always likely to leave some readers unsatisfied, but the coverage manages to be comprehensive without altogether sacrificing the level of detail necessary to make the book valuable to the more serious student. The book is divided into the three main sections which are common to all titles in the series: an introduction addresses the question of what it is about the god that warrants attention and incorporates a critical overview of previous scholarship; a central section - by far the largest part of the book - elaborates key themes and ideas; and finally there is a discussion of the reception of Zeus since antiquity. D. observes a predominantly chronological sweep but succeeds in grouping common themes so far as is possible.

There are, however, one or two puzzling choices; for example, I could see no point in including two representations of Phidias' statue of Zeus, the only difference being the size of the Nike figure (fig. 4, p. 25). There are perhaps some problems - in the introductory section particularly - with regard to the stated aim to cater for the general reader in addition to students (p. xi). Ease of understanding is sometimes sacrificed for the sake of brevity. For example, in summarising the early events in Zeus's mythology, D. moves from the care received by the infant Zeus straight to Kronos being bound and confined (p. 5). Only someone already familiar with the mythology would realise that in that lacuna Zeus has grown up and rebelled against his father's rule. The story is, however, explained more fully later (pp. 35-6), so a simple reference forward would have sufficed. No explanation is offered of the asterisks which are used to prefix reconstructed Indo-European names (e.g. pp. 9-11). Then, perhaps erring in another direction, an account of the origin of metopes is not strictly relevant to the understanding of Zeus (p. 8). A little more care over the choice of what basic details to include and how to organise that information could have made the book more easily comprehensible to a wider range of people. There are of necessity many questions not addressed. For example, in the light of the many anthropomorphic depictions appearing throughout the book, D.'s claim that Zeus has no human shape (p. 5) needs justifying. But if readers are provoked or inspired to seek further information elsewhere, then that is no bad thing. University of Leeds SUE HAMSTEAD s.d.hamstead@leeds.ac.uk</page></plain_text>
