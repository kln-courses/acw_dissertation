<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imagination and Its Gender in Maimonides ' Guide 1 3 Imagination and Its Gender in Maimonides' Guide Ruth Birnbaum Dr. Ruth Birnbaum retired from the faculty of the Department of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the summer of 1996. Her publications on Jewish philosophy, history, and religion have appeared in various scholarly journals - Judaism, Hibbert Journal, The Personalist , and several others. She has also lectured and participated as a panel member at various academic conferences and religious institutions, and has currently been commissioned by a quarterly journal to do a réévaluation of Martin Buber. Maimonides explicates the Bible with a philosophic plumb line to probe its rational depths. The truth of the Bible for Maimonides is in fact a philosophical truth, but since the unsophisticated masses of people could not grasp this truth in its abstract nakedness, the Bible used veiled language to transmit its message. For those with a strong rational bent, however, the dictates of reason made it difficult to accept biblical passages literally. For them the truths of Scripture had to be reconciled with the logical truths of reason. Towards this end, Maimonides wrote The Guide of the Perplexed , explaining biblical terms and parables to enable his kinsmen to hold fast to their integrity in both domains. Maimonides anchors his synthesis in the Aristotelian system in which all things in nature are specified by form and matter. To fathom this understanding in the Bible, Maimonides follows a chain of traditional usage in ascribing gender to concepts of form and matter. The gender of imagination as a faculty of the body was clearly established by the ancient philosophers and scholars. "Plato and his predecessors designated Matter as the female and Form as the male."1 Form, as distinct from the weaknesses and corruptions of matter, is the intellectual faculty of the soul which humans share with the Divine. Whereas intellect is able to distinguish the universal from the particular and the essential from the accidental, imagination cannot obtain a purely immaterial image of an object. "Imagination is in no way able to hold itself aloof from matter."2 This accounts for the anthropomorphisms and the physical presence of angels in the Bible. Being unable to form an idea of a spiritual being, the masses endow forces and energies 'Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed , tr. Shlomo Pines (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), 1.17, p. 43.

"All this follows imagination, which is also in true reality the evil impulse ."3 Matter, moreover, is in a constant state of privation, continually divesting one form for another. As scriptural proof for the pervasive evidence of philosophic ideas, Maimonides demonstrates this ongoing process of privation in matter as follows: How extraordinary is what Solomon said in his wisdom when likening matter to a married harlot , for matter is in no way found without form and is consequently always like a married woman who is never separated from a man and is never free. However, notwithstanding her being a married woman , she never ceases to seek for another man to substitute for her husband, and she deceives and draws him on in every way until he obtains from her what her husband used to obtain. This is the state of matter.4 Philo of Alexandria, the progenitor of the allegorical method of interpretation of the Bible, similarly equated mind with man and the bodily senses with woman in his exposition On the Creation , portraying the corrosive control of matter over mind through the womanly wiles of the senses: Pleasure, being a courtesan and a wanton, eagerly desires to meet with a lover, and searches for panders, by whose means she shall get one. ... It is the senses that act as panders for her and procure the lover. When she has ensnared these she easily brings the Mind under her control.5 Regarding Solomon's proverbial wisdom, "A woman of virtue who can find?" (Prov. 31:10), Maimonides explains that the virtuous woman is philosophically and figuratively understood as matter in man in its most stable condition. It neither dominates nor overpowers him, but facilitates the control of mind over matter. This stratification of intellect over matter determines and distinguishes between an individual as a human being created in the image and likeness of God, or, failing to attain this predominance of the rational faculty, coming under the classification of an animal having the shape and configuration of a human being6 From Maimonides' assessment of these abstractions as male and female components, it is possible to categorize them into three different relationships. The first is an antithetical relationship, as seen in the Garden of Eden. Here the female faculty of imagination acts in opposition to the male form of intellect, resulting in a diminishment of man's intellectual essence. The second is a hierarchical relationship in which values of superior and inferior 3 Guide 11.12, p. 280. Italics in all quotations are as they are found in the text. 4Guide III. 8, p. 431. Cf.

Maimonides exhorts the rule of the masculine form of intellect over the female constituent of matter. He introduces the passages "And women rule over them" (Isaiah 3: 12) as being contrary to what man was told at the beginning of Creation: "And for thy husband shall thy desire be and he shall rule over thee." (Gen. 3:16)7 The third is a relationship of instrumentality in which the masculine form of intellect uses the feminine form of imagination to invest abstract ideas with sensual images to disseminate the teachings of the prophets to the multitude. As abstractions, form and matter in their designated genders of male and female do not belong exclusively to woman qua woman or to man qua man, but they are neutrally dispersed in both sexes alike. The very term wisdom ( hokhmah ), in its ultimate sense as the intellectual faculty leading to the apprehension of God, is personified in Scripture in the feminine mode. Citing Proverbs and Jeremiah , Maimonides reveals the philosophical underpinnings of Scripture where wisdom is raised to the highest pinnacle of the true speculative science. "And all things desirable are not to be compared to her."8 As evidence that the faculties of intellect and imagination inhere in both genders, Maimonides directs our attention to the prophet Aaron and the prophetess Miriam. With the exception of Moses, who is the unique and unparalleled prophet, both Aaron and Miriam attained the highest degree of prophecy, requiring the perfection of the intellect and the perfection of the imagination. The sages, Maimonides informs us, acclaimed this acme of divine blessing in describing the deaths of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "that the three of them died by a kiss" of the Lord because of the intensity of their love for Him. The figurative expression, "by the mouth of the Lord" (Deut. 34:5; Num. 33:38), was applied to Moses and Aaron, but the rabbis declared that the sensual anthropomorphism was inappropriate to apply to Miriam, as she was a woman.9 As a woman, Miriam represented matter, and this imagery persisted at her death. The Two Foci of Imagination Imagination, in Maimonides' rational world, occupies both an exalted and an inferior position among the faculties of humans. At its apex, this special internal sense, in conjunction with intellect, produces the most perfect individual - the prophet. At its 1 Guide III.8, p. 433. %Guide III.54, pp. 636-37. Prov. 3:15, 8:11.

For the most part - and except for this solitary peak of prophetic perfection - where intellect reigns, imagination is a drain. If we would assume a ladder with its base on the ground and leading by upward degrees to the knowledge of God, intellect would occupy the uppermost rung, while imagination would not only be relegated to the bottom rungs of the ladder but would be considered an obstacle to such knowledge. Imagination, moreover, as the antithesis of reason, is a deficiency which is never employed as a figure in speaking of God.11 Citing David's exhortation to his son Solomon to "know thou the God of thy father," Maimonides states that to know God always refers to intellectual comprehension, not to imagination, for the latter "is not called knowledge , but that which cometh into your mind"]2 In further disdain of the imagination, Maimonides admonishes those who describe the Creator in terms of human perfections. Every human attribute ascribed to God is necessarily an omission. "With every additional positive assertion you follow your imagination and recede from the true knowledge of God."13 It is the imagination, in effect, abounding in human hyperbole, that not only circumscribes God's essence, but ascribes a plurality to Him which is impossible. From the foregoing, it is justifiable to assume that the faculty of imagination, being wholly steeped in matter, is responsible for the unredeemed condition of humans, preventing them, as it does, from attaining a true knowledge of God and from actualizing the essence they share with the Divine. l0Guide 1.2, p. 25.

Maimonides' emphasis on intellectual speculation as a means to arrive at a true knowledge of God may account for his disdain of poetry as a genre which is nourished by the figurative expressions of the imagination. A further corollary to this emphasis on the intellect may be Maimonides' position that midrash was a product of halakhah, as opposed to that of Nahmanides, who maintained that midrash was the source of halakhah.

Commenting on the prohibition in Leviticus 22:28 against killing an animal with its young on the same day, Maimonides states that there is "no difference regarding this pain between man and the other animals. For the love and tenderness of a mother for her child is not consequent upon reason, but upon the activity of the imaginative faculty, which is found in most animals just as it is found in man."14 Imagination functions here as an instinctual sense for the care and preservation of the species. Although he speaks disparagingly of imagination, Maimonides, curiously enough, has recourse to this internal sense when he presents arguments to refute Aristotle's theory of the eternity of the universe in favor of the possibility of Creation. Maimonides argues that one cannot infer from the nature of a thing as it appears in its present perfect state, to the condition of the thing when it began its process of development. Using the example of the foetus in the womb, Maimonides demonstrates that it would be very difficult to explain the stages of growth to an isolated man on a lonely island who had never seen a woman or any female being: Man begins his existence in the womb ... of a female, which has a certain form. While in the womb he is very small; yet he has life, moves, receives nourishment, and gradually grows, till he arrives at a certain stage of development. He then leaves the womb and continues to grow till he is in the condition in which you see him. The orphan will naturally ask: "Did this person, when he lived, moved, and grew in the womb, eat and drink, and breathe with his mouth and his nostrils? Did he excrete any substance?" The answer will be, "No." Undoubtedly, he will then attempt to refute the statements of that person ... in the following manner: "When any one of us is deprived of breath for a short time he dies, and cannot move any longer: how then can we imagine that any one of us has been inclosed in a bag in the midst of a body for several months and remained alive, able to move?"15 In the above analogy a proper measure of imagination is indeed needed to overcome the inconsistencies of strict reasoning. Maimonides' intent is to illustrate from the foregoing example that the universe as it exists in its present perfect state is no indication of the state of its being prior to its present perfect state. Since Aristotle himself was aware that he did not prove the eternity of the universe, Maimonides uses this model to allow for the possibility of Creation and consequently of miracles and ÌA Guide III.48, p. 599. 15 Guide 11.17, pp. 295ff.

An isolated man on a lonely island brings to mind Ibn Tufayl's historical-philosophical romance of Hayy ibn Yokzn who, as a child, was cast ashore on an uninhabited island. As he grows up he spends his days in solitary contemplation. Although no direct parallel can be drawn with the purposes of Maimonides' analogy herein, the association is inescapable. In another context a relation can be drawn herein to the perfect individual who chooses solitude to avoid the pitfalls of societal temptations. See Guide 11.36, p. 372.</page><page sequence="6">18 SHOFAR Fall 1997 Vol. 16, No. 1 prophecy.16 Maimonides is similarly aware that his analogy raises difficulties as to whether the necessary, the possible, and the impossible are founded on reason or on imagination or on some other faculty which distinguishes between them. This problem is confounded by the fact that what is logically unimaginable exists in reality, and what is imaginable is logically untenable. Maimonides illustrates this with the example of two persons standing on two extremes of a diameter passing through the earth's center, with their feet facing on a straight line with the diameter. If the diameter is parallel with the horizon, they would both fall. If not, the lower one would fall. On the other hand, that which the imagination accepts as necessary is disputed by the intellect. Maimonides illustrates this with the example that two spaced parallel lines will be perceived as converging in the distance, although they would never meet even if extended to eternity. The imagination being rooted in matter cannot logically contain within itself the disagreement of two contrary properties in one object. It is unable to abstract and thereby cannot conceive of existents except as bodies or as they inhere in bodies.17 The tension between the intellect and the imagination reflects to some extent the tension existing between the philosopher and the religious thinker. According to the latter, creatio ex nihilo is possible; according to the philosopher, it is impossible. Whereas the philosopher asserts that what exists is necessary, the religious thinker claims that what exists is not necessary but is produced by the will of God.18 Maimonides' position is a blend of both with a strong philosophic bias. The systems of both Maimonides and that of the Muslim Kalam , for example, agree on the temporal creation of the world, the specific difference between them being that the Kalam is imaginative, whereas that of Maimonides is based on rational considerations. Kalam starts from presuppositions, not because they are true, but because they make it easy to prove the beliefs taught by the law; Maimonides starts from evident presuppositions which are in accordance with the nature of things.19 Imagination in Rabbinic Literature Maimonides' philosophic treatment of the faculty of imagination relies substantially on rabbinic literature for his interpretation of the parables and prophecies in Scripture. What may have been understood as figurative language by those who studied l6Guide 11.15, pp. 289-293; 11.25, pp. 328-330. 11 Guide 1.73, pp. 210-1 1. xzGuide III. 15, pp. 459-61. 19Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing (Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1952), pp. 40-41 . See Guide 11.36, p. 369 on the primacy of intellect to imagination.</page><page sequence="7">Imagination and Its Gender in Maimonides ' Guide 1 9 philosophy was not so perceived in the minds of many of the faithful. For the rabbis and the mass of believers, the truths of Scripture hovered over the plain meanings of the word. Their understanding of the divine message was fleshed out in the biblical narratives which they probed for their understanding of the word of God. A remarkable illustration of the two perspectives regarding Form and Matter, i.e., the philosophic-abstract approach as against its gender embodiment of male and female, unwittingly turns up in rabbinic texts. Responding to the rhetorical question, "A woman of virtue who can find?" (Prov. 31:10), the Talmud relates that in Palestine they used to ask a married man about his wife, "maza' " or " moze ' "? Maza ' refers to the scriptural verse, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a great good" (Prov. 18:22). Moze ' refers to the passage, "And I find the woman more bitter than death" (Eccles. 7:26; Berakhot 8a). In the succinctness of this expression, the response of the husband indicates that he has either found a flawless gem or he is the subject of a flawed condition. Translated into its philosophic mode, these are statements regarding Form and Matter and the quality of existence. Thus, the customary paean of praise recited by the husband on Friday night lauding his wife as the woman of virtue (Prov. 3 1 : 10-3 1) confirms traditionally its philosophic-allegorical reference, i.e., that the husband, the rational soul, is grateful to his wife, composite matter, for helping him maintain his excessive passions in check so that he may actualize his intellectual form.20 A parallel illustration is likewise reflected in the Creation story. Maimonides informs us that Adam was endowed with perfect intellect in his prelapsarian condition, distinguishing between the true and the false. "However, when he disobeyed and inclined toward his desires of the imagination and the pleasures of his corporeal senses ... he was punished by being deprived of that intellectual apprehension."21 The science of necessary truths of true and false which he previously possessed was replaced by the knowledge of apparent truths of good and evil. Rabbinic literature on this narrative describes Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden in concrete human terms. Untutored in abstractions, the rabbis saw the lures of imagination embodied in the feminine component with the assertion that Satan was created with Eve.22 In the midrashic idiom Satan has many faces and is variously synonymous with a number of attributes, including the serpent-seducer. Adam, confronted with his disobedience, directs the responsibility of his lapsed condition to Eve, who, in turn, lays it on the beguiling counsel of the serpent. The midrashic mode of expression is: "The serpent 20See B. T. Berakhot 24a : "His wife is like his body ( kegufo )." 21 Guide 1.2, p. 25. 22Genesis Rabbah XVII.6.</page><page sequence="8">20 SHOFAR Fall 1997 Vol. 16, No. 1 was thy [Eve's] serpent [i.e., seducer], and thou art Adam's serpent."23 Satan is also the Tempter, the Persuader, and the evil impulse , which Maimonides equates with the imagination.24 In spite of the overwhelming evidence on the pitfalls of the appetitive mainsprings of imagination, far from being a stumbling block to right apprehension, this potent faculty has a virtuous role in the denouement of the Creation story. Its predestined mission was embraced by the authors of midrash based on the biblical passage, "And God saw everything He had made, and Behold, it was very good" (Gen. 1:31). They said it was good in terms of the good impulse, but it was very good in terms of the evil impulse . Were it not for the evil impulse , no man would build a house, take a wife and beget children, or transact business.25 The evil inclination was necessary to fulfill the commandment to be fruitful and multiply (Gen. 1 :28). Imagination serves here as a blessing where goad engenders good. The fall-out in the Garden of Eden narrative similarly leaves an ambiguous rabbinic trail of both baneful and beneficial consequences for women. Because Eve is regarded as the embodiment of the Temptress causing Adam's disobedience, authors of midrash assess women with the gravity of their infraction. She covers her head because "she is like one who has done wrong and is ashamed of people." She is given the precept of menstruation "because she shed the blood of Adam," causing death in the world. She is given the precept of dough "because she corrupted Adam, who was the dough [hallah] of the world." She was given the precept of lighting the Sabbath lights "because she extinguished the soul of Adam." The editors, in the spirit of judging all women favorably, mitigate the yoke of these reprimands, adding that these were meted out not as punishments but as privileges "to emphasize the inviolate character of women, to sanctify the bread one eats and spread the cheer of the Sabbath as symbolized by light."26 Their comments reverberate the talmudic view that "a life without a wife is devoid of joy, blessing and well being" ( Yebamoth 62b). In the open forum of traditional discourse, the gates of interpretation are never closed. The bodily sense of imagination in rabbinic writings was regarded not as an abstract faculty, but as a palpable potency capable of dire and destructive consequences. An idea in itself does not necessitate motion until desire is conjoined with the idea and 23 Genesis Rabbah XX. 1 1; XXII.2. 24 Genesis Rabbah XX. 1 1; XXII.2, Vayera LIV.l; Guide , 11.12, p. 280. 25 Genesis Rabbah IX.7.

Rabbis were generally explicit regarding the many temptations which titillate the senses and which required extreme precautions to keep the fertile imagination in check. They were aware that each of the bodily senses, if directed in any slight measure beyond the innermost chamber of the marriage threshold, was fraught with the torments of Gehenna. The Talmud frequently forewarns its readers regarding the potent dangers to the imagination which could impede concentration in reciting the Shema , the supreme affirmation of the existence and unity of God (Deut. 6:4). "Whoever looks upon a woman's little finger is as though he gazed upon the pudenda." A woman's leg, a woman's voice, a woman's hair is a sexual excitement ( Berakhot 24a ; Shabbat 64b). The associative flow of imagery arising from the least exposure to these bodily senses required that it be thwarted at its source. Walking behind a woman, even one's wife, could forfeit the blessings of the World to Come ( Berakhoth 61a ; Kiddushin 80b). An opaque space of visual imperturbability was required as a buffer to arrest the onset of the imagination. The suggestiveness of the sense of touch which Eve added to the first injunction not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was a sufficient cause to entail the descent of Adam and the human race (Gen.3:3). This sense of touch is especially aspersed by Maimonides as "a disgrace to us."28 Maimonides points out that the anthropomorphic senses attributed to God in the Bible are sight (Gen.6:5), smell (Gen. 8:21), and hearing (Num.1 1:1), but not touch and taste.29 It is beyond the scope of this study to encompass in detail the many citations in rabbinic literature to avoid sensual entrapments, but from the inordinate propensity towards these enticements that arouse the imagination, it would appear that ten kabs of this faculty descended to the world, and that nine were taken by men.30 The rare instance of a reverse seduction is noted in midrash. When the evil impulse sees a person ogling with his eyes, fixing his hair and walking with a pompous strut to attract the attention of women, the Tempter exclaims: "This man belongs to me."31 Mention should also be made of Rabbi Gidal, who sat at the gates of the ritual bath to instruct the 27Cf.

Asked how he kept his passions in check, he responded: "They look to me like a gaggle of white geese" ( Berakhot 20a). In this respect, imagination develops its own accommodations for the sake of heaven. In rabbinic parlance: "An arrow in Satan's eyes" (. Kiddushin 81a, 30a). With few exceptions,32 and on balance, the pervading presence in rabbinic writings of the seductive influence of women which ensnares the imagination is generally proportionate to descriptions of women as reductive in intelligence.33 Beyond the rare exception of Beruriah, who is cited in the Talmud for her extraordinary knowledge of Jewish law and Scripture ( Pesahim 62b; Sukkah 52b; Berakhoth 10a; Erubin 53b), references to women's rational capacity usually refer to their intellectual deprivation. When wisdom is attributed to women, it is most often relegated to the domestic arts or to "an aptitude for stratagems and ruses."34 Encomiums for women generally relate to their distaff preoccupations as reflected in Proverbs 3 1 : 10-3 1 . But even this endowment is somewhat tempered by the talmudic comment: "There is no wisdom in woman except with the distaff' ( Yoma 66b). It is beyond the scope of this study, as well, to encompass herein the many references to women in rabbinic literature as to their intellectual insufficiencies. What does emerge from the foregoing overview is that the sages and scholars of classical sources of tradition were not disposed towards regarding the imagination and the intellect as disembodied faculties, although they were disposed towards ascribing these faculties to women and men. Their core of concern, to be sure, was to live as a holy people and to avoid the quotidian quicksands which could in any manner reverse this design. Exegesis by Gender Acts of God in the Bible are described by Maimonides as being performed through the intermediation of angels. Because the majority of people have difficulty in forming a notion of a spiritual being, the prophetic books, speaking the language of the populace, depict angels in human form who fulfill divine commandments in creaturely ways. They are, in essence, intelligences independent of matter, created by God to execute the will of God. Man's "imaginative faculty is likewise called an angel and ... the intellect is called a cherub?5 In order to explicate the meanings of the prophetic vision, Maimoni- 32Under Hezekiah's reign women were educated.

By applying a feminine designation to the abstract faculty of imagination, Maimonides is able to establish a convenient exegetical code for interpreting parables in the Bible. He demonstrates this in two examples wherein angels are depicted as women, one deriving from midrash and the other from the prophecy of Zechariah.36 Maimonides' emphasis on the presence of women in both these sources is significant for the method of his exposition. In this endeavor, he borrows freely from rabbinic sources, but restricts his citations to quotations which serve as "hints" and innuendos "sufficient to awaken the attention." While it may appear that Maimonides is following a time-honored rabbinic tradition of quoting a part of a biblical passage and omitting the essential proof-text part, such is not his resolve. He is engaged in a revelatus-absconditus disclosure, frequently alerting his readers with such comments as: "You can draw inferences from what I have mentioned as to what remains of the things I have not mentioned."37 In the first example, Maimonides expounds on the midrash to Genesis 3:24. After the expulsion of Adam, God placed at the entrance to the Garden of Eden "the flaming sword which turns every way." The midrash comments that the expression "which turns every way" alludes to the changeable forms of angels. Sometimes they turn into men, sometimes into women, sometimes into spirits, and sometimes into angels. Maimonides points out that "through this dictum [the Sages] have made it clear that the angels are not endowed with matter and that outside the mind they have no fixed corporeal shape, but . . . are only to be perceived in the vision of prophecy in consequence of the action of the imaginative capacity. . . ,"38 Angels which assume the shape of a woman signal a defect in perception grounded in imagination. It is thus sufficient to inform one of the appearances of angels with a female visage to indicate an imperfection in the mode of apprehension. The nature of this deficiency is further developed by Maimonides to be predicated on directives in the Bible concerning sacrifices in the Temple. These offerings were distinguished by "the species and the sex." The greater the sin that had been committed, the more defective was the species to be offered, and "a female is in all species more defective than the male."39 Although the authors of midrash were untutored in the speculative sciences, they were able to garner evidence from Scripture for their midrashic expositions. Among the inferences to be drawn that Maimonides does not mention are those 36 Guide 1.49, pp. 109-10. 37 Guide 11.42, p. 390. 38 Genesis Rabbah XXI.9; Guide 1.49, pp. 108-109. l9Guide III.46, pp. 587-88; see Num. 15:27.</page><page sequence="12">24 SHOFAR Fall 1997 Vol. 16, No. 1 derived from the exponent parts of this midrash. According to the rabbis, "the flaming sword which turns every way" refers to Gehenna "because it revolves about man and burns him up from head to foot."40 Gehenna in this context represents the passions of the imagination unleashed and sexual desire run rampant, with the result that one consigned to Gehenna forever forfeits the peace, ease, and tranquility of the Garden of Eden. They apply a similar explanation elsewhere, stating that Joseph resisted Potiphar's wife so as not to inherit Gehenna.41 Being aware of the non-redemptive element of the "flaming sword," the authors of midrash follow up with a hopeful palliative as to its explicit meaning. The sword, they propose, which turns every way, is a "double-edged" deterrent to disaster (Ps. 149:6). In its Hebrew derivation, the sword, herev , is the biblical instrument used in circumci- sion (Josh. 5:2) and refers to the Torah. By these means, i.e., the study of Torah and the performance of its commandments, a person can stem the tides of temptation engendered by the imagination.42 Maimonides comments that in a subsequent midrash involving the angel of desire, the rabbis interpret the encounter of Judah and Tamar on a quite different plane. Judah, they explain, wanted to pass by Tamar thinking her a harlot, but God Himself dispatched the angel of lust to appear to Judah in order to execute His will that kings and redeemers might arise from their union. Thereupon, "And he turned into her" (Gen. 38: 15).43 In this midrash, the male identity of the angel subsumes an intellectually conceived design. In the second example, Maimonides focuses on the aspect of angels appearing in the form of women in the prophetic vision of Zechariah. "And behold, there came forth two women and the wind was in their wings" (Zech. 5:9). Maimonides significantly juxtaposes the appearance of women both in the midrash and in the prophetic vision suggesting a correspondence of cognate features.44 Here, too, the citation requires elucidation beyond the immediate quotation. Zechariah' s vision of the two women is preceded by the sighting of a woman as the embodiment of sin. "And behold there was lifted up a round piece of lead - and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the measure, and [the angel that spoke to me] said: 'This is Wickedness.' And he cast her down into the midst of the measure, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof' (Zech. 5:7,8). In this context the weight of lead serves as a restraining cap on the woman who 40 Genesis Rabbah XXI.9. Gehenna is the place where the wicked are punished for their sins in the hereafter.

Thus the weight of restraint herein has a bond with the yoke of the commandments which keeps the evil inclination bridled. In talmudic terms: " Gehenna is situated deep down in the earth and is immeasurably large. Hence the whole world is like a lid for Gehenna " ( Pesahim 94a). Maimonides continues to explicate the vision of Zechariah, stating that since God too is described in anthropomorphic terms, it is likely that the multitude of people might be led to believe that the essence of God is the same as the essence of angels. Therefore to indicate that the existence of God is more perfect than the existence of angels, certain forms of lower animals were introduced to describe angels. "An angel shape is attributed to them by attribution of wings only and in no other way." By these means, the existence of the Creator is shown to be more perfect than that of the angels, "just as man is more perfect than the irrational animals."45 Maimonides' illusive "hints" lead to the implicit conclusion that female angels with wings have an affinity with lower animals. In explaining this parable, Maimonides is counterposing the hierarchy of beings in the celestial sphere to the hierarchy of beings in the terrestrial world. Angels are inferior to God in the same degree that the feminine species, lacking in rationality, are inferior to male species. Imagination in Prophecy In the qualitative leap to the intellectual contemplation of the Divine, the imaginative forms are raised to a perfection and emerge as a sublime faculty in humans. The contemplation of the Divine heals and purifies the imagination, liberating it from the dross and defilement of its material origins. "[The] greatest and noblest action [of the imagination] takes place only when the senses rest and do not perform their actions."46 In this state it receives an overflow of divine inspiration. This overflow is the cause of prophecy. Thus when imagination, inadequate by itself, is conjoined with intellect, it emerges as the prophetic ideal resulting in knowledge which transcends the boundaries of rational comprehension. For the gift of this influx, Maimonides posits three perfections - the perfection of the rational faculty, the perfection of the imaginative faculty, and that of the moral virtues. Of these, the rational and moral virtues may be attained through a regimen of training. The internal sense of imagination, however, depends on a natural predisposition which varies in its capacity and cannot be cultivated. With Moses, however, the prophet non pareil, the opposite was true. "While all other prophets received the influx [of prophecy] from the agent intellect via the 45 Guide 1.49, pp. 109-10.

His senses remained intact, and as Alexander Altmann comments, "God had to cover Moses with His hand in order to prevent him from being distracted" by his senses. Moses is a prophet sui generis , the term "prophet" being applied to Moses and other others homonymously.47 Since the stratification of two necessary perfections for prophecy, namely, the intellect and the imagination, consists of the overflow of the Active Intellect from God first towards the rational faculty and then towards the imagination, it is a given that the perfection of the imagination depends upon the perfection of the rational faculty. Therefore, cautions Maimonides, those who have not attained intellectual perfection must not take notice of their dreams - dreams being merely the dust of prophecy. An underdeveloped rational faculty combined with a highly developed imagination produces the statesmen, the lawgivers, diviners, and charmers. Those who legislate political laws which do not deal with rational matters belong to this class of people who have perfected only their imaginative faculty; they are not prophets. As for those who have developed a strong rational faculty but possess a weak imagination, they are to be counted among the wise men or philosophers. Here again the singularity of Moses must be invoked as the unparalleled lawgiver and prophet.48 The condition that a natural predisposition for prophecy is one which cannot be cultivated indicates that there are degrees of perfection and receptivity of the imaginative faculty. Maimonides declares that the measure of this endowment during sleep is inferior to that operative in the prophetic vision. Moreover, the imaginative power is further diminished by states of sadness and dejection. Citing the rabbinic dictum that divine inspiration does not descend on the prophet during these moods, Maimonides points to Jacob as one who received no prophetic revelation while his imaginative faculty was preoccupied with the loss of Joseph. For the same reason, prophecy ceased during the period of the Exile because of the dejection of the Jewish people under captivity. Although the imaginative faculty was not operative in Moses' prophecy, divine revelation similarly ceased during his state of depression following the report of the spies, until the generation of the wilderness died out. Divine communica- tion with Moses continued, but it was not of the direct genre as described in Number 12:8, "With him do I speak mouth to mouth."49 47"Moses Narboni's 'Epistle on Shi 'ur Qomď by Alexander Altmann in Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies , Alexander Altmann, ed.

Having first been purged from its impure moorings, it is now the function of the imaginative faculty to reinvest the divine message with material images, acquiring "so great a perfection of action that it sees the thing as if it were outside . . . and appears to have come ... by way of external sensation."50 Operating on the prophetic level, imagination is what Julius Guttmann calls "the creative power of conceptualization."51 Although this method is necessary for the instruction of the common people, it does not lead to a true sense of the words. To understand the essence of the divine word, it is necessary for the intellect to distinguish what is said allegorically, figuratively, or hyperbolically, and what is to be understood literally, according to the original meaning of the words. There is thus in the interplay between these two perfections of intellect and imagination a continuous process of mutual refinement until the form is distilled from its material content.52 Conclusion In the process of reconciling reason with revelation, Maimonides uncovers not only the recondite meanings important for philosophy, but as a corollary, he reveals the mainsprings of the feminine constituent in relation to the masculine component. Confronted with the figurative language and the anthropomorphisms in the Bible, Maimonides is constrained to defer to this bodily sense of imagination as an indispens- able resource for his rational exposition of Scripture. The feminine faculty of imagination, which he rejects for its fanciful constructions, has become withal the chief cornerstone for Maimonides' exegesis. In fact, it may be said to be the sine qua non of the Jewish religious consciousness. 50Guide 11.36, p. 370. 51 Julius Guttmann, Philosophies of Judaism (New York: Anchor Books, 1964), pp. 496-97, n. 46 to chapter on "Aristotelianism and Its Opponents." 52Guide 1.68, p. 166; 11.47, pp. 407^09.</page></plain_text>
