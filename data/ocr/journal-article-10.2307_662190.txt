<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN URN FROM THE RIO AGUARICO, EASTERN ECUADOR By JOHN GILLIN T HE urn pictured herewith was collected by the writer in the course of an ethnological reconnaissance on the Rio Aguarico in eastern Ecuador in March, 1935, on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. The specimen was presented to me by two Aguarico Indians who happened to share our camping place on a playa one night. These men informed me that they had found the urn during the preceding day while hunting for turtle eggs. It was protruding from the bank of a right tributary of the Aguarico, apparently having been exposed by erosion of the creek bank dur- ing recent high water. Inasmuch as none of the Indians living in the vicinity make or use such articles at the present time, I went next morning to the spot where the specimen was alleged to have been found. A hole was found in the side of a mud bank with evidences of considerable digging by sticks and cutlasses. The writer is convinced that the urn was found by the In- dians in situ, four feet six inches deep in alluvial, gray clay. The surface of the ground was covered to a depth of about nine inches with vegetable mould and a matting of roots from the forest growing there. Two trees more than fifty feet high were found growing within a radius of fifteen feet inland of the spot where the urn was lying. We had no tools for digging, but a day spent in working with cutlasses revealed several sherds of gray, undecorated pottery and a hearth of charcoal at a depth of five feet nine inches from the surface. The creek in question, which is nameless, is a right tributary of the Aguarico which joins the latter an estimated forty-five miles above its mouth. The site is located on the left bank of the creek about one and a half miles above its mouth. The country is at present uninhabited by Indians for a distance of forty miles upstream, although about six miles downstream from its mouth Sefior Abraham Duque's small plantation is situated, the most upstream outpost of white settlement. Measurements: diameter at lip, 141 inches; diameter at bulge, 19 inches; di- ameter at bottom, 6 inches; total height, 151 inches; width of decorative band, 10 inches; circumference at lip, 46A inches; circumference at bulge, 57- inches; cir- cumference at bottom, 19 inches. The color of the exterior background surface is brownish red and the design has been applied with white paint. Over the whole a gum glaze seems to have been applied. The surface of the interior is grayish, with a few pink- ish marks of firing barely discernible. Since there are no marks of smoke or indications that the urn was used over a fire after manufacture, the conclu- sion that it was a ceremonial container seems valid. 469</page><page sequence="2">470 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 38, 1936 The design is interesting, although the writer has been unable to identify it positively either in detail or in style with any previously published ar- chaeological or ethnological material from the Amazon basin. Apparently two conventionalized faces are represented, the eyes of which can be dis- tinguished by two oblongs placed side by side, a motive which occurs twice. Suggestive analogies are found in pictures of funeral urns from the Island of Maraj6, published by Netto.' The design may be said to have a "gener- ally Amazonian feeling" without corresponding in many details to designs so far published from other sites in the area. The general treatment of broad lines contrasted with very light ones, of straight lines, sharp curves, and sharp angles is also suggested by an urn of anthropomorphic shape re- ported by Uhle from the Rio Napo, found at a point twenty leagues above the mouth of the Aguarico.2 Faint analogies may also be seen in some of the decorative art of certain present-day Indians of the upper Marafion and lower Ucayali, reported by Tessmann.3 UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 1 L.
