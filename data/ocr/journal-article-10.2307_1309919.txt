<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS Judging by their letters concerning experi- mental animals (March 1985 BioScience 35: 138), Paul Harwood, James Hickman, and Judith Weis seem to be confused as to the meaning and moral implications of the articles (November 1984 BioScience 34) to which they refer. These articles are a discussion of ethical problems of animal experimentation. Paul Harwood's letter has to do with funda- mentalism and antiscience, not with the prob- lem of the ethics of animal experimentation. James Hickman apparently does not under- stand that there is a problem. He says: "To me the moral stance is that of respect and compassion for all life forms that shuns all wantonness and ill use. Eating a cow is no better or worse than eating wheat." The sec- ond sentence is a startling non sequitor, in- deed, a flat contradiction of tfie first. From an ecological and societal standpoint, the state- ment is questionable. From a humane stand- point, it is shocking. Although Hickman is a botanist, it is hard to believe that he does not know that cows, unlike wheat, have a nervous system closely similar to our own, and can suffer pain and fear. From his viewpoint, aside from the questions of legality and flavor, he might just as well substitute the word "human" for '"cow." Judith Weis asks a valid question from the viewpoint of regulating animal experimenta- tion, but she does not seem to understand that the problem is not simply a taxonomic one. She says that in the debate over laboratory animals, the definition of "animal" was not addressed, and that while biologists know what an animal is, different animal rights and humane groups are concerned with protection of different phyla and classes of animals. It seems evident to me, that once we accept that life is a continuum, we must also accept that it is difficult to draw sharp dividing lines. When, for practical purposes, such a line must arbi- trarily be drawn, the decision on where to draw it must be relevant to the purpose for which it is drawn. If the purpose is to avoid suffering of experimental animals, it is clear that the position of the line must be related to the ability of the animals to feel pain, and to suffer. It is also clear that there may be degrees of ability to feel pain and to suffer. There is thus a valid problem as to where we wish to specify protection-not because we are willing to have some animals suffer and not others, but because the taxonomic line where pain and suffering begin is not a sharp one. Where there is a question, the animal should be given the benefit of the doubt. Where we know the animal can suffer, the problem becomes one of justifying the use of such an animal in experiments for human benefit. If we decide it is justified, then it is a moral responsibility to reduce pain, fear, and suffering to the minimum possible. Where the experiment is inherently objectionable be- cause of the degree of suffering involved, it should not be done, regardless of scientific or direct practical value. Judith Weis remarks that the veterinarian must "sign off" each time she experiments on fish, that she is treating them properly, and that the veterinarian says he really knows nothing about fish, "which is to be expect- ed." Part of the veterinarian's responsibility is to see to the welfare of the experimental animal. If fish are the experimental subjects, he should make it his business to know some- thing about them. The failure of many scien- tists to recognize their responsibility to the experimental animal is part of the problem. MARJORIE ANCHEL Scientists Group for Reform of Animal Experimentation 147-01 Third Avenue Whitestone, NY 11357 FAN MAIL This is just to say that I was very pleased with the February 1985 issue of BioScience, so much so that I have enclosed a check for AIBS membership in order to get personal copies of future editions! In my work over the past three years on the staff of the Office of International Affairs of the National Research Council, I have found BioScience to be one of the most useful journals I receive. I am a "generalist" in science for development with a Ph.D. in chemistry, but I often work on agricultural, health, and environmental topics. Fortunate- ly, my training in bioorganic reaction mecha- nisms provides the broad base needed for understanding technical detail at the level of articles in your journal. While I profit from reading your technical articles, I also appreci- ate the quality of the space you devote to policy issues such as the piece, "Research Malpractice," by Daryl Chubin. Thanks again for enlightening me and oth- ers who have left the laboratory for the policy world but need to understand what the bench scientists are doing to begin to think about the global implications of today's science.

They do not speak or write a different language but have more careful, precise, and systematic meanings for the words they use. If their concepts differ sufficiently from those of ordinary language, they must have different words for those concepts. When it became obvious that the older English words kind and sort were too broad and imprecise, the words species, genus, and the whole range of words for nomenclatural categories were brought in, usually borrowed from Latin or Greek be- cause such words did not interfere with the meanings of words already in the English (or other) languages. When Kramer (July/August 1984 BioSci- ence 34: 405) speaks of anthropomorphic and teleological implications in the word strategy, I know precisely what he means, but when ecologists use strategy for "long-term proc- ess" (January 1985 BioScience 35: 66), they are not being more careful, precise, or sys- tematic but rather introducing into the con- cept represented by that word an unwarranted foreign concept-that of planning, a thought- out means to an end. Thus they are also introducing a sharp distinction, both in kind and in time, into a continuous process that differs as it proceeds only in amount and variety of effects on the organisms affected and their reactions to them.
