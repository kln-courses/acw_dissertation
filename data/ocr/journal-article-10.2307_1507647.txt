<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRAZER'S "FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT" HENRY PRESERVED SMITH UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY, NEW YORK SIR JAMES GEORGE FRAZER is a well known authority on the subject he has made his own, and his voluminous works are familiar to every student of anthropology and the history of religions. The fact that he has put his extensive knowledge at the disposition of the Old Testament student is to be welcomed. This he has done in the works mentioned below,' the larger one in three volumes, the smaller one by condensation and omission giving the main points of interest. That the larger work meets a felt want is indicated by the fact that a second printing was called for the year after the first publication, a symptom of the present interest in the comparative study of religions. The present reviewer makes no claim to be an authority on folk-lore, and has no criticism to offer on that part of the work. In the larger edition abundant references are given to the sources from which the information is drawn, and we have no reason to question the accuracy of the citations. The inter- est of the biblical student naturally turns to the Old Testament passages treated, with the desire to learn how far the alleged parallels help us to an understanding of the religion of Israel. The author's position is that the Hebrews, like other races, passed through a period of barbarism, and that this is attested by many references in their literature which can hardly be ex- plained except as survivals from a far lower level of culture than the nation had attained in the period in which its literature took shape. With this statement we have no quarrel. The time is past when we could draw a sharp line of division between the "sacred" history of the little nation of Israel and the "profane" 1 Folk-lore in the Old Testament: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend, and Law, by Sir James George Frazer, Hon.

Mankind is one, and all its mem- bers have travelled substantially the same road, so far as they have advanced towards what we call civilization. Each stage of the advance had its links with the preceding one, and brought over a part of its ideas and customs. Survivals are therefore a constant phenomenon in the history of religion as in all other history. Even the most radical reformer must speak a language understood by his fellow men, and that language embodies earlier ideas and testifies to earlier custom. It would be un- necessary to state what seems so self-evident, were it not for the fact that many religiously minded people hesitate to apply to our Scriptures the method of comparative study which has been so fruitful in other fields of inquiry. The superficial observer, taking up these three large volumes (seventeen hundred pages of matter), may be tempted to think that the result is to reduce the whole Old Testament to folk- lore, and thus deprive it of all originality. In fact, however, the passages of the Bible brought into the discussion are compara- tively few in number. It is the number and variety of the alleged parallels which make up the bulk of the volumes. The biblical material in many cases consists of bare allusions, as we shall see. Perhaps it will conduce to clearness if we distinguish the kinds of material which go under the name of folk-lore. We can select folk-stories, which circulate among the people and are then taken up into the literature, and put them in a class by themselves. There remain the folk-customs, survivals of rites or actions the reason for which we are left to conjecture. Examples of both classes may be found in the story of Jacob, as it was re- corded by the earliest pentateuchal narrators. The authors evi- dently collected folk-stories from the lips of the people and made them into a collected whole for the delight, and perhaps the edification, of their people. Jacob was a hero, not of strength and warlike deeds, but of shrewdness and cunning. From the narrative we can separate at least one folk-tale almost un- touched by the editor. This is the anecdote of the patriarch's wrestling with a mysterious stranger at the ford of the Jabbok (Gen. 32, 24-32). All the marks of a local saga are here - the night season, the uncanny being attacking the intruder on his</page><page sequence="3">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 65 domain, his desire to be released before the dawn should rise, his refusal to give his name. That all these can be paralleled in other religions is abundantly shown in the work before us. Yet it may be worth while to notice that the Hebrew writer had more than a purely literary interest. Coming across the story in his inquiries, he found that it would explain the change of name from Jacob to Israel. The name, too, of the place - Penuel,' Face-of-God'-seemed significant. It is noticeable that the narrator did not in so many words identify the mysterious being with Yahweh, though possibly he meant his readers to assume that it was the God of Israel who thus revealed himself. The parallels adduced by Frazer 2 make it probable that in the original story it was the spirit of the river who resented the intrusion of the stranger. Such parallels are found in Greece, Africa, India, and even among the American Indians. In this connection we are reminded of the discovery of a spring in the South Country by Hagar (Gen 16 and 21). In this case it was a friendly divinity who appeared and revealed the fountain, and probably the original saga thought of him as the spirit who dwelt in the spring. In one form of the story the nar- rator calls him Elohim; in the other we learn at the conclusion of the account that it was Yahweh, for Hagar "called the Yah- weh who appeared to her" by the new name El-Roi. To be sure, the present text speaks of the angel of Yahweh in one case and the angel of Elohim in the other, but this is due to later scrupulosity. Like Homer and Kipling, therefore, the Hebrew writers took their material wherever they found it, and like them they adapted it to their purpose, which was to show how the ances- tral God revealed himself to the fathers. Among the tales which early attached themselves to the sanctuaries of the land we must place the account of Jacob at Bethel. The patriarch comes to the place not knowing that it is sacred. But a dream is the means of revelation, and it tells him that the divinity dwells there. He' therefore erects a pillar which he consecrates by anointing it. So it becomes a bethel, a house of God, and the spot is a centre of worship throughout the history of Israel. 2 Volume II, pp. 412--424. My citations are from the three-volume edition.</page><page sequence="4">66 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Such stones, as is well known, were adjuncts of the altar at many Israelite shrines, and parallels are adduced from many regions. In fact at the present day a saint may reveal himself in a dream as inhabiting a certain rock and command that the people pay him honor there. Examples are cited from Palestine, and Frazer has no difficulty in finding others. That dreams are the means of revelation is an almost universal belief, and the ladder reaching up to heaven also has its parallels. Citations of dreams, ladders, and sacred stones are given here.3 Another sacred stone is mentioned in connection with Jacob's covenant with Laban (Gen. 31, 44-54). Two accounts have ap- parently been combined, as is so often the case in Genesis. One speaks of a heap of stones, a cairn; the other of a single stone, a pillar like the one at Bethel. Each account assumes that the sacred object, whether cairn or pillar, is inhabited by a divinity, for both are called upon to witness the covenant. The covenant is ratified by the parties eating on the cairn - doubtless in order that the spirit may take part in the feast. Frazer is inclined to think that eating on the stone is similar to some other stone- ceremonies where the parties tread on a stone to indicate the firmness with which they give their pledge.4 This does not come out in the biblical account, though covenants at the altar (an- other sacred stone) were doubtless common in Israel. Stories such as this are significant in that they show the multitude of local sanctuaries in the pre-deuteronomic period. At each of these shrines the divinity was more or less distinctly identified with Yahweh, and the result in the mind of the common man was practical polytheism, something against which the proph- ets and finally the author or compiler of Deuteronomy pro- tested. The story of Jacob thus gives us genuine folk-lore, modified in certain particulars in order to teach the lesson which the nar- rators had at heart. In the cases of Penuel, Bethel, and now of Mizpah we have sagas connected with place-names. Somewhat different is the story of Jacob's securing the birthright. Or, if we take it as folk-lore, suggested by local and geographical con- siderations, we cannot altogether adopt the explanation sug- 3 Volume II, part II, chapter IV. 4 Volume II, part II, chapter VIII.</page><page sequence="5">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 67 gested by Sir James Frazer. What he does is to take up a sug- gestion of Joseph Jacobs 5 to the effect that in early Israel the first-born son had no superior claim, but that by preference the inheritance went to the younger, by what he calls ultimogeni- ture. According to the theory, Jacob's sharp practice was designed to secure that which was his by right, but which he feared to lose. In various regions of the earth the custom of ultimogeniture has undoubtedly been established, What Sir James shows by his citations is that among pastoral peoples not infrequently the older sons, as soon as they reach maturity, take their flocks and go in search of new pastures. The youngest son is thus left in the paternal tent and inherits it on the death of the father. But the only indication of such a custom in Israel is the case of Jacob. Everywhere in the Old Testament it is assumed that the oldest son has the preference. Isaac, it is true, was younger than Ishmael, but Ishmael as son of a slave would naturally be regarded as inferior. How the matter lay in the mind of the Hebrew writer is clear. In his genealogical scheme Ishmael and Isaac were brothers; that is, Ishmaelites and Isra- elites were of the same stock. But Ishmael, living in the south- ern desert, had affinities with the clans who lived on the borders of Egypt. Therefore he was not of pure blood, and not fully en- titled to the inheritance promised to Abraham. This leaves us with the case of Esau and Jacob, twin brothers of pure blood on their mother's as well as their father's side. The puzzling fact (to the man who adopted the current view of the preference of the first-born) was that Esau the elder had the comparatively poor country of Edom, while Jacob the younger had the Prom- ised Land. Doubtless popular opinion had solved the problem before our Hebrew writer approached it. In popular opinion, as we have seen, Jacob was a hero of finesse, and in his dealings with his brother as well as those with Laban his shrewdness stood him in good stead. He first drove a hard bargain for the birthright, and then deceived his father and defrauded his brother, aided and abetted by his mother, thus securing the blessing which gave him title to the land. If any custom of ul- timogeniture existed in Israel, this author betrays no conscious- , Studies in Biblical Archaeology, 1894, pp. 47-63.</page><page sequence="6">68 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ness of it, and the popular opinion which had anticipated him was equally ignorant. Instead of remaining at home and thus securing himself in possession of the family property, like the younger sons in pastoral society, Jacob was the one who went away to seek his fortune. The patriarchal stories reflect tribal conditions, and the nar- rators are bound by geographical considerations, in the case both of Esau and of Ishmael. Still it remains true that in describing the family life of the patriarchs the authors would picture social conditions as they were familiar with them. Had there been any custom of ultimogeniture in Hebrew society, they would have given it a place in their narratives. But except for the instances alleged, which we have discussed, we seek in vain for any hint of such a custom. Interesting as it is therefore to read the accounts of the custom as it has existed in various quarters of the globe 6 we cannot feel that the data really bear on the subject of folk-lore in the Old Testament. And what the elaborate discussion of the jus primae noctis which is appended has to do with the Old Testament is difficult to understand. The single allusion to the so-called Tobias-nights which is ad- duced from the Latin version of Tobit certainly does not belong to the Old Testament. The story of Jacob gives us still other material for discus- sion. When his father-in-law gave him Leah instead of Rachel, he pleaded the custom of the country, which did not allow a younger sister to be married before the older. In all probability the custom was as Laban stated it, for in this case we have parallels in plenty.' In some tribes it is not even allowable for the younger son to marry before the older, or if it is done it is looked upon as a grave breach of morality. In some tribes also the husband of an older sister has a prescriptive right to the younger ones. Jacob's marrying the two sisters was therefore in accord with ancient custom, although later legislation for- bade such unions, One survival, however, shows that in Israel the custom at one time prevailed. This is the levirate, accord- ing to which if a man dies without issue it becomes the duty of his brother to marry the widow and thus raise up seed for the 6 Volume I, part II, chapter II, pp. 429-565. 7 Volume II, pp. 263-341.</page><page sequence="7">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 69 deceased. Whether this is a survival from a system of group- marriage, as Sir James supposes, we need not decide. For the Hebrew legislation, or the preservation of ancient custom, as the case may be, the motive is plain. It was the desire for off- spring, that every man should have a son to perpetuate his name. In the last resort the aim probably was that due honor should be paid to the spirits of the parents after their death. At the evidence for animism we shall look in another con- nection. A tempting subject for comparative study, as the commen- taries have found out, is the great flood. Sir James here treats it at length, basing his discussion correctly on the older (J) of the two documents from which the text is made up. The record bears all the marks of folk-lore, and we must suppose that it circulated orally for some time before it found a literary man to put it into written form. The fact that it is based on a Babylon- ian original is now too well established to be ignored. Whether it reached the Canaanites before the Hebrew occupation of the country, or whether it came when increased commercial activity in the reign of Solomon promoted the interchange of ideas, we can no longer make out. What interests us as students of the Old Testament is the way in which the author has treated his material. He takes over the main features of the story; the warning by the divinity, the building of the ark, the wide- spread destruction, the sending out of the birds, and the sacri- fice at the end are all here. But it is all purged of its polytheism. In the Babylonian original the gods sit in council, then one of them without the knowledge of the rest surreptitiously warns his favorite. Ishtar weeps as she sees the death of her worship- pers, Bel is angry that a man has escaped. The gods themselves cower like dogs before the storm, then elbow each other to get a share of the sacrificial aroma. In the Hebrew account Yahweh alone is the actor, rewards Noah for his righteousness, remem- bers him when the flood is at its height, takes occasion by the sacrifice to resolve never to send another deluge. For comparative study, then, the Babylonian material would seem to be sufficient. But Sir James gives us the embarrass- ment of riches. To about five pages taken from the Bible he</page><page sequence="8">70 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW gives over two hundred and fifty of other flood-stories.8 He not only surveys mankind from China to Peru, but he traverses the great ocean to China again. While the information is no doubt valuable, we might raise the question whether most of it belongs in a discussion of folk-lore in the Old Testament. The conclu- sion that we draw from examining it is that stories of this kind arise in various ways. In Babylonia, for example, some great inundation of the Euphrates valley was magnified in the imagi- nation of later generations, and finally became a part of the received mythology. Similarly, it is easy to suppose that the Ganges in flood was the germ of the Hindoo story. In other regions some other cause must be sought. In the island-world the sight of lands rising precipitously from the ocean would lead men to speculate on the possibility of the ocean having once covered the highest peaks. The phenomenon of tidal waves would encourage such speculations, and it is well known that the observation of fossil shells found far from the ocean was ex- plained as the result of a cataclysm such as tradition connected with Noah or Deucalion. Such remains were thought to attest the accuracy of the biblical account almost down to our own time. We are in presence therefore of something which is not peculiar to the Bible, but is part of the intellectual development of the race, mythological in so far as it attributes natural phenomena to the action of the gods, scientific in so far as it attempts to explain the working of natural forces. In his treatment of the creation-story in Genesis Sir James again rightly leaves the priestly document out of the discus- sion. The inevitable anthropomorphism of the early thinker is plainly in evidence, and we have no hesitation in calling the substance of the account folk-lore. What was the form of the original oral tradition, if such existed, we have no means of knowing. What is plain is that to the desert-dweller an oasis is the home of a divinity. The hand of man has not made it fruit- ful; some supernatural agency must have planted its fruit-trees and watered them. Just as man rejoices when by irrigation he has redeemed the barren soil of the desert, so Yahweh rejoiced in the garden he had planted, and he refreshed himself by walk- 8 Volume I, part I, chapter IV.</page><page sequence="9">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 71 ing there in the cool of the evening. The fashioning of man out of the soil seemed the proper way of creation to people accus- tomed to watch the work of the potter; and "dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return" suggested itself when men observed the dust to which the human frame is reduced by the process of dissolution. So far there is nothing in the story that should surprise us. The mystery comes in with the appearance of the serpent, and the taste of the forbidden fruit. Sir James is in- clined to think that in the source from which the Hebrew writer drew, the two trees in the garden were a tree of life and a tree of death. He therefore cites as parallel a number of legends 9 which describe how the divinity sent a messenger to men telling them to eat of the tree of life, but that the messenger, either of malig- nant design or through mere stupidity, changed the message. So men ate of the wrong tree, and in that way death came into the world. With the best will in the world we cannot find any trace of such a legend in our Hebrew story. So far from the divinity wishing man to be immortal he takes pains to prevent such a consummation, and expels him from the garden lest he should eat of the tree of life. What is plain is that the Hebrew writer thought it a matter of course that the master of the garden should impose such restrictions as he chose. Moreover to test the obedience of the newly created Adam seemed not a bad thing. Does not righteousness consist in obedience to the divine command? The motive of the serpent remains enigmatical, to be sure. We at once dismiss the traditional theory that he was the evil spirit, the tempter. As the wisest of the animals it seems more likely that he valued knowledge, and thought it a pity that Adam and Eve should be deprived of what would pro- mote them to the state of gods. The author of the account had no interest in the story as folk-lore. In all seriousness he was at- tempting to solve social problems. Why should the peasant be compelled to gain his bread by hard toil? Why should woman have so difficult a parturition and yet crave motherhood? An answer to these questions seemed given by the narrative of Eden. 9 Volume I, pp. 52-76.</page><page sequence="10">72 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Whether Sir James Frazer is quite fair to the author in saying that he had deep contempt for woman, shown by the lateness of her creation and the irregular and undignified method of it, is a question that suggests itself. It would be more just to say that taking her from man's side (nearest the heart, shall we say?) and making her bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh was designed to show her fitness to be a companion meet for her husband, one for whom he would leave father and mother. It seems again to be reading something into the text when Sir James declares that Yahweh flew into a towering passion. In the parallels alleged to the creation-story the two con- trasted trees are assigned to man and the serpent in such a way that while man partakes of the fruit of death, the serpent eats of the tree of life and so attains immortality. Observation of the fact that the serpent sheds its skin and so renews its youth gives occasion for this theory. If this feature appeared in the original from which the Hebrew writer drew, he has drastically changed his text. We have already said that we have no wish to deny that the original was a folk-story - the part played by the serpent is sufficient to classify it as such. But we fail to find a tree of death in the tree of knowledge. Perhaps it may be pleaded that a tree of death is indicated by the threat: "In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die"; but the threat stands quite by itself and has no influence on the sequel. In fact the serpent was quite right when he assured Eve that she should not die from eating the fruit, but that she and her husband should become like God in knowing good and evil. This was the actual result, as is confessed by Yahweh himself. All things considered, therefore, we do not find that the stories which tell of the perverted message are actually parallel to the biblical account. In immediate sequence to the story of Eden we have a dis- cussion of the mark of Cain.10 The subject is confessedly one of great obscurity, and light thrown on it from any quarter would be welcome. The fear of the murderer that whoever should find him would slay him seems uncalled for, if there were no men on the earth, as the narrative shows, except Cain's own par- 10 Volume I, part I, chapter III.</page><page sequence="11">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 73 ents. It is suggested by Frazer that what he feared was the ghost of his victim. What we learn from the biblical text is that the blood of the murdered man cries from the ground, and when there is no next of kin to avenge the death Yahweh himself is appealed to. Banishment from the cultivated country and from the presence of the divinity is the penalty, in accordance with later usage. What surprises us is that Yahweh, instead of acting as the avenger, gives Cain a mark to protect him from every enemy. The blood of the exile is of course free to the first comer, and it is this which arouses Cain's fear. Possibly his imagination peopled the wilderness with hostile demons. Was the mark an amulet to protect him from the ghost? This is Frazer's hypothesis, and perhaps as good as any. Certain rites intended to propitiate the ghost in case of manslaughter are adduced as parallels. On the other hand it is possible that the Hebrew author has taken up a tradition of the tribe which re- garded Cain as their ancestor, according to which their tribal mark, on which they relied as a protection from all enemies, was originally given them by the grace of God. After the flood came the tower of Babel, and the story is un- doubtedly to be classed as folk-lore. Attached originally to one of the great temple-towers in the Euphrates valley, something which aroused the wonder of the Bedawin, it was welcomed by the Hebrew author because it seemed to explain the puzzling varieties of human speech. Frazer takes occasion in connection with it to relate various myths concerning attempts of men to reach the sky, and also various theories which have been held about the original language of men u1 and the reason for the dif- ferences which now prevail. Except where biblical influence is to be suspected, these stories are not closely parallel to our text. That the Hebrew author drew on an early myth is not unlikely. If so, he discarded the polytheism, as he did in other cases. The anthropomorphism is not unlike what we have already met in other passages. The Samson story has given rise to a large amount of discus- sion. The sun-myth hypothesis has some attractive features, but the alleged mythological details have mostly disappeared 11 Volume I, part I, chapter V.</page><page sequence="12">74 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW from the tale as it has come down to us. The hero is no longer the sun taking his course through the constellations. He is a knight-errant seeking and finding occasion to fight the enemies of his people. The only primitive feature is the belief that his strength lay in his hair, and this is similar to what we find among other peoples, as is abundantly illustrated in the work under review.'2 In its grotesque form it asserts that the life of a magi- cian or of a giant is so connected with a certain hair that when this is pulled out the man dies. More remote, but well attested, is the belief that a man's soul or his life is kept safe in some place remote from his body, in an egg, for example, or a bird. Of this belief in Israel we have no very conclusive evidence, though Sir James Frazer finds an allusion to it in Abigail's prayer that David's life may be bound in the bundle of the living and that the lives of his enemies may be slung out of a sling.13 Analogies are found in the churingas of the Australian natives. More precarious is the hypothesis that the houses of the soul (nephesh) mentioned among the ornaments worn by the women of Jerusalem in Isaiah's day are amulets in which the wearer keeps her soul from harm. Scent-boxes or bottles of smelling- salts might receive the name because of their power to revive the fainting soul. In the case of Samson the Hebrew text ac- counts for his strength residing in his hair by making him a Nazir, the sign of his consecration being his unshorn locks. When these were gone, Yahweh departed from him and he be- came like any other man. To this extent the Hebrew writer at- tempts to give a religious coloring to the narrative. The note that Samson judged Israel twenty years, which is made the occasion of a sarcastic remark by Sir James, does not belong to the original story, but is part of the attempt to give the period some sort of chronology. The term 'judge' in any case gives us a false impression, if we read into it the modern meaning. Although we have not yet met a clear indication of the idea that the soul can be detached from the body, there is one passage which shows the existence of such a belief. This is Ezekiel's denunciation of women who practice uncanny arts (Ezek. 13, 17-213). We learn from that passage that women 12 Volume II, part III, chapter VI. 1~ Volume III, part III, chapter VII.</page><page sequence="13">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 75 claiming to be prophetesses made and sold amulets, and that they pretended to be able to entrap people's souls in nets, thus slaying or keeping alive whom they would. The melancholy history of witchcraft in all ages gives the commentary on the passage. Like other witches these practitioners plied their trade for pay - a handful of barley or a morsel of bread. Sir James illustrates this particular art of catching souls from Africa and East India.'4 The attitude of the prophet is thoroughly hostile, yet he seems to concede that the method of the witches is sometimes effective, for instead of saying that their efforts are vain and nought, he declares that Yahweh will interfere and counteract their activities by tearing their nets and letting the souls go free. Doubtless the men of light and leading in Israel were constantly in conflict with the lower ideas held by the common people and revealed to us by this little sermon. The popular religion is shown to us by the opposition of the prophets, and in like manner the prohibitions of the Law are significant. Among these a prominent place must be given to the legislation against certain rites of mourning. These include shaving the head, trimming the beard, and making cuttings in various parts of the body. Such actions when a death occurs in the family or neighborhood have been observed in all parts of the world. Readers of the Thousand and One Nights will re- member the havoc which the slave Kafur wrought by a false report that his master was dead. Not only did his mistress throw off her veil, rend her clothes, and tear her face with her nails, but she called the slave to help in destroying the furniture of the house. Similar expressions of grief, as we interpret them, are observed at the present day, including the shaving of the head, or the shearing of the long locks of the women. While we naturally attribute these actions to grief at the bereavement, there are indications that something more is involved. The fact that the hair is deposited at the tomb, or wound around the tombstone, is significant, for it reminds us that hair-offerings are brought also to the gods. Cuttings of the flesh are acts of wor- ship, as is attested by the priests of Baal in their contest with Elijah. It seems quite clear, therefore, that we have to do with 14 Volume II, pp. 511 f.</page><page sequence="14">76 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW survivals of a primitive animism, worship of the departed. In fact the dominant emotion at the sight of death is fear, and where there is belief in the activity, often malevolent, of the ghost, the natural effort is either to conciliate it or to ward it off. Whether the mutilation or painting of the body was not origi- nally intended to disguise the person and so escape the notice of the spirit we cannot determine. There seems no clear evi- dence of such an intention in Israel. What is significant is that the actions prohibited are said to defile the Israelite, that is, make him unfit to approach the sanctuary. Worship of any other divinity than Israel's own God does thus defile. We are reminded that in Greek religion he who had been in the sanctu- ary of a hero must undergo purification before approaching the higher gods. Bearing this in mind we understand Ezekiel's energetic protest against the custom of burying the kings of Judah in the palace, in close proximity to the temple. The prophet in fact stigmatizes the reverence paid to these dead as idolatry ("whoredom"). The tenacity of such animism is shown by the denunciation of a later prophet, aimed at those who provoked Yahweh by lodging among the graves, and showed their consecration to the abhorred objects of worship by warning men against coming near them lest they too partake of the infection. All these prohibitions and denunciations show the strength of folk-custom, in proportion as they testify to the reaction of the prophets and lawgivers against it. The crowning evidence of animism is the account of the visit of Saul to the witch of Endor. To understand its place in the literature we must remember that the life of Saul was written by a man who, looking back upon it, was obsessed by the idea that the misfortunes of the king were due to his rejection by Yahweh. The older document, which is preserved in part, shows that the people were moved to demand a king not by "dissatisfaction with the rule of pontiffs who professed to govern them in the name of the Deity," 15 but by the Philistine oppression against which the tribal sheikhs could make no headway. And the same sources show that Saul was measur- ably successful. That his nerves gave way under the heavy ~5 Volume II, p. 517.</page><page sequence="15">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 77 strain is hardly to be wondered at. As all that happens is by the will of the god, the neurasthenia was attributed to an evil spirit sent by Yahweh. The consequent rejection by the prophet is pictured for us not only by the account of the Amalekite war but by the interview with the spirit of Samuel with which we are now concerned. Whether popular tradition had already taken hold of the subject we have no means of knowing. The popular belief is plain. According to the Law, necromancers are among the practitioners of forbidden arts, but the desire to consult the spirits of the dead is almost uni- versal. That it involved some sort of worship seems clear from the fact that the woman in this case called the spirit which she saw a god. Sir James Frazer has no difficulty in presenting parallels to this evocation of spirits, not only among what we call savage tribes but from classic authors as well."6 Its preval- ence in Israel is made known not only by this chapter but by the denunciations of the prophets. From this point of view it is not hard to understand the emphasis laid by the early narratives on the burial-places of the ancestors. Space forbids extended discussion of all the examples urged by our author. That Joseph could divine by means of a magic cup was doubtless in accord with popular belief. The man- drakes found by Reuben were regarded as having magic power in Israel, as they were in Christian countries down to the middle age. The fable of Jotham, which makes the trees talk, belongs to a well-known class of literature. The ideas concern- ing a census of the people which came to the front in the life of David are easily paralleled outside of Palestine. Sacred trees are apparently indicated by some Scripture passages and are in accordance with what we find in other regions. The visit of the queen of Sheba is told in a straightforward manner by the biblical writer, and is quite different from the rabbinical and Muslim exaggerations which are here rehearsed; and the story of the judgment of Solomon seems to have no parallel except in literature which we must suspect to have borrowed from the Hebrew. The story of Moses' infancy, however, stands on a somewhat 16 Volume II, part III, chapter VIII.</page><page sequence="16">78 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW different footing. Sargon, an early king of Babylon, relates that his mother placed him in a basket of reeds and committed him to the river. The resemblance to the story in Exodus is so close that we are warranted in suspecting some connection. Popular imagination, as we know, loves to adorn the infancy of great men with marvels, and probably this story, borrowed from Babylon, circulated among the people for some time before it was put on record. Sir James takes occasion from it to quote a number of anecdotes of the exposure of infants who afterwards became great," but it is not likely that they have any place in folk-lore in the Old Testament. So with the crossing of the Red Sea; ancient faith in the direct working of the divinity natu- rally saw in the event the intervention of Israel's god, much as Josephus saw a providence in Alexander's march along the flooded beach at the base of the Taurus mountains. This and some other alleged parallels are cited, but of course there is here no question of influence on the biblical text. In Israel, as elsewhere, codified law embodies social custom and we must expect to find in it traces of folk-lore. An example is the curious prohibition: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk." Sir James gives a sketch of the historical de- velopment in accordance with the now accepted results of criti- cism,'s and points out that this regulation is not only found in the earliest document but is repeated in two other places, the repetition being evidence of the importance with which it was regarded. The explanation which he suggests is based on the observation that in certain pastoral tribes the boiling of milk is prohibited because of the belief that this treatment of it would affect the cow that gave it, make her lose her milk or even bring sickness upon her, an example of sympathetic magic. It must be clear, however, that if the Hebrew author had had any notion of this kind, he would have made his prohibition sweeping enough to prevent all boiling of milk. What he does forbid is the specific action of boiling a kid in its own mother's milk. In the so-called decalogue of J we find commandments dealing with the agricultural life. When Israel should come into Canaan they would observe the feasts in honor of Yahweh, who by 17 Volume II, part III, chapter I. 18 Volume III, part IV, chapter II.</page><page sequence="17">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 79 bringing them into the land became lord of the soil. But in learning the art of cultivation they were in danger of taking over various idolatrous rites on which the Canaanites supposed the fertility of the soil to depend. The complaint of the biblical authors is in fact that the people worshipped the Baals and Ashtarts. Now the kid seems to have been associated with the worship of Ashtart. It is not difficult to suppose that what is here prohibited had some reference to her as the goddess of animal fertility. There is something to be said therefore for the statement of a mediaeval writer to the effect that there was a magic rite intended to increase the fruitfulness of the fields in which a kid was boiled in its mother's milk, and the flesh then cut in pieces and scattered over the ground. In the two older codes the prohibition follows the command to bring the first- fruits to the altar, and just before this is the prohibition of offering leavened bread with the sacrifice, and of leaving any fat until the morning. It looks as though the things prohibited were of Canaanitish observance; and if the bringing of the first- fruits suggested that steps should be taken to secure a contin- uance of the fertility to which they testified, we can understand the place in which we find the command; as though the lawgiver were saying: Bring your firstfruits, but do not attempt to follow the tradition which recommends the boiling of a kid in its mother's milk. This is conjectural, but without conjecture we do not get very far. Let us look at one instance in which the Law has actually taken up a piece of folk-custom. This is the ordeal of jealousy."9 The primitive religious ideas underlying the rite are obvious. A woman suspected of adultery is brought to the sanctuary for the decision of God. She is led to the altar and an offering of barley meal is put into her hand. She is solemnly adjured con- cerning her possible guilt. She is then made to drink of the ordeal cup, the contents of which are sacred water (a phrase no- where else used in the Old Testament, possibly from a sacred well) in which dust from the floor of the sanctuary has been mixed. The priest, having written out on a piece of parchment the curses which he has already pronounced, washes them off 19 Volume III, part IV, chapter V.</page><page sequence="18">80 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW into the cup which the accused person must drink. Evidently the sacredness of the water and of the dust, reinforced by the curses now contained in the cup, are believed to have the power in themselves of distinguishing the guilty from the innocent. We are told in so many words that if she is guilty the result of the ordeal will be to inflict serious disease upon her (perhaps produce abortion), whereas if she is innocent she will be fruitful. Parallels are alleged in great number by Frazer, most of them from Africa. The difference between these and the Hebrew cus- tom is that in Africa the drink administered is an active poison. If the stomach of the accused person rejects it, he is assumed to be innocent; otherwise death follows, often hastened by violence on the part of the spectators. The crime brought to this test is usually witchcraft, though instances are recorded of women clearing themselves of the charge of adultery by taking the poison. So firm is the faith of the natives in the accuracy of the test that when they believe themselves to be suspected they will ask for the trial. The comparative humanity of the Hebrew rite, in which no poison is used, needs no emphasis. What effect sug- gestion may have had on the victim is not revealed, since no cases of application of the test have been recorded. It is not difficult to suppose that faith in the power of the curse might induce confession of guilt, or in a person of nervous tempera- ment might cause serious derangement. In any case it seems to be something like a work of supererogation to collect the large number of examples of the poison-ordeal which are here massed together. I have passed over a number of places in which the analogy between Hebrew beliefs and customs and those of other nations does not seem established. Thus in connection with Jacob's de- ception of his father we read that the skin of a kid was placed on his hands and neck as part of his disguise. Frazer makes the detail a text for a long discussion of ceremonies of a new birth in which skins of sacrificial animals are used. To the Hebrew narrator, however, the detail would naturally suggest itself without any symbolical reference. With regard to the cove- nant between Yahweh and Abraham it does not seem necessary to suppose the author conscious of the original meaning of the</page><page sequence="19">FOLK-LORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 81 parties passing between the pieces of the slain victims. It was enough for him that the form was already an established thing to which Yahweh graciously conformed. Whether the ox that gored was regularly brought to trial before being condemned, after the method used in the middle age with animals guilty of manslaughter, is not told us in our text. The silence of widows which is inferred from the etymology of the word seems nowhere to have been observed in Israel. While there may be differences of opinion concerning these points, we may give a little further attention to the hypothesis of the activity of evil spirits. From the phrase "keepers of the threshold," applied to a certain class of officers in the temple, our author deduces the existence of certain beliefs in Israel, similar to those which are attested in other nations. There seems to be in fact a wide-spread custom of treating the thresh- old with respect, and we naturally think that the explanation is the fear of spirits which lurk there. The only question is whether such a fear could be entertained with reference to the temple. One would suppose that the presence of Yahweh would forbid any trespass on his territory by the demons. In this con- nection we read the denunciation of Zephaniah: "I will punish those who leap upon the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and deceit." The connection seems to make it clear that what the prophet has in mind is some foreign custom, and it is difficult to find in it evidence of more than that. From a story in Samuel we learn that the Philistines were careful to avoid stepping on the threshold of their temple. But this again gives no certain evidence as to Hebrew belief or custom. Something of the same kind may be said about the discussion of the bells on the robe of the highpriest.20 We concede at once that bells and gongs, as well as the firing of guns and crackers, are supposed to ward off the evil spirits. But in the case of the highpriest we remember that he is a consecrated person, that his raiment is sacred in the highest degree, and that he wears it on the most solemn festival of the year. Is it likely that in the temple and in these circumstances the demons would show their activity? On the other hand we remember that to come un- 20 Volume III, part IV, chapter VII.</page><page sequence="20">82 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW announced into the Most Sacred Room might be fatal to the intruder. The case of Uzzah would be in point. What we con- clude is that the bells were to indicate to the divinity that his servant was coming for the solemn act of purifying the place of his dwelling. That the divinity was in fact present in the temple in the most literal sense was of course the firm belief of the com- pilers of the Law. This paper has touched upon the more important points raised by Frazer in his elaborate discussion,21 and the reader can form a judgment as to how far the material helps to an under- standing of the Old Testament. That it in fact throws light on some passages which have been a puzzle to the commentators, and that it brings the religion of Israel out of the isolation in which earlier study kept it, is clear. But it is also clear that the religion of Israel on which folk-lore throws light is not the reli- gion which most nearly concerns us. The popular religion of Israel, like the popular religion of other nations, had its sacred trees, its sacred stones, its sacred wells. It adored local divin- ities even when it called them by the name of Yahweh. It sought communion with the dead, and paid some sort of rever- ence to the spirits of the departed. All this we recognize, and it is brought into clearer light by such a study as we have now examined. But even the writers who have preserved these evi- dences of early belief and custom show that they did not alto- gether adopt the popular view; and it is noticeable that the passages to which parallels are found in other religions are not taken from the works of prophets or psalmists or sages. These men, to whom we owe what is of most value to us, rose above the religion of the mass and set themselves in direct opposition to it. Our study makes us realize the obstacles which they must have encountered and the courage with which they surmounted them. 21 These topics are discussed also in the abridged edition. The main differences be- tween this and the larger work are the omission of the long footnotes and the excision of some of the less important chapters. The two most extended of these are the discus- sion of cross-cousins and ortho-cousins suggested by Jacob's marriage, and one on boring the servant's ear. In both cases the result for the Old Testament is very slight.</page></plain_text>
