<plain_text><page sequence="1">actual objects, of which 55 are in color. The reader is offered a comprehensive view of the subject with the assistance of several charts of geologic and archaeological periods, maps of the geographical distribution of the caves, and plans of the configuration of the individual caverns. A particular feature of this volume is that the author has made a special effort to represent the objects by actual photographs, substituting drawings or supplementing them with drawings only when photographs could not adequately present the object. Other draw- ings (most of them by Breuil) were employed to represent elements not visible in a photo- graph, such as the engraved contours beneath a painting. Now that photography-especially color photography-is capable of accurately recording the details and the nuances of paint- ings under the difficult conditions prevailing in the caverns, our documentation is vastly su- perior to that when we had available only Breuil's pastel drawings and sketches as a per- manent record. The usefulness of the illustra- tions in this book is increased by a thorough and precise documentation which includes the sizes of the objects and even references to spe- cialized studies made of them. The extensive bibliography is probably the most complete of any yet published in a book on the subject of paleolithic art. The approximately 200 pages of text in- cludes general remarks on paleolithic man and his environment, and is divided into two major sections on mobilary and cave art. The objects themselves are segregated according to tech- nique or media-such as bas-relief, statue, en- graving, painting, etc.-and are arranged within these categories according to their rela- tive simplicity or complexity. Although this organization assures ease in finding a desired object, it has the disadvantage of making dif- ficult any attempts to study the broad evolution of style by a comparison of objects in different media but with stylistic similarities. This method of comparison, effectively applied by Breuil, has the potentiality for unusual results because of the fact that many of the mobilary objects can be dated by the archaeological level in which they were found. By a compari- son of stylistic features with cave art, a rela- tive chronology for the paintings and wall en- gravings can be suggested. The author's stated intention of "present- ing the reader with a panoramic view" of paleolithic art has resulted in a work of en- cyclopedic scope. Since this breadth of view is enriched by a well-selected group of excel- lent photographs accompanied by a thorough documentation, a most valuable general refer- ence work is achieved. But two important as- pects of this art have been only summarily dis- cussed-the stylistic evolution of the painting and sculpture, and the meanings of the various types of figures. Comte Begouen's influential article on the magic origin of paleolithic art, for example, is only mentioned and does not appear in the otherwise excellent bibliography. And of the other scholars who have studied the meanings or the stylistic development of the art, with the exception of the psychologi- cally oriented and presently somewhat discred- ited views of Luquet, only a few-such as Breuil, Balfour, Haddon, and Marconi-are dis- cussed.

It is regrettable that the ART JOURNAL XXII 1 56</page><page sequence="2">publisher did not undertake more careful editing. This might have eliminated such minor but irritating errors as labelling the illustra- tion of the wellknown Le Corbusier Pavilion at the Exposition des Art Decoratifs, 1925, as the Lipchitz house at Boulogne-sur-Seine; nu- merous awkwardnesses of translation; and the confused statement about the sculpture at New Harmony, Indiana (where the only cast in the U.S.A. of the Notre Dame de Liesse is mag- nificently set beneath an open air dome de- signed by Philip Johnson). In a monograph of this scope it is surprising that we are given almost no information on the number and loca- tion of various casts (for example, the Prome- theus, in the Philadelphia Museum of Art is illustrated) but there is no indication of the splendid cast on the facade of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and there are dozens of other such omissions among the smaller bronzes. The book was obviously not intended to be a catalogue raisonne. Nonetheless the reader ought to be informed as far as reason- ably possible of the location of every impor- tant work. The editorial lapses in the illustra- tions are even more irritating. Thumbing through the plates, one assumes that the con- vention of a chronological sequence has been observed. As indeed it has, except for a num- ber of unnecessary and misleading interrup- tions: such as two works of 1917 inserted among those of 1914-1915, and the only warn- ing for the uninformed reader is in the list of illustrations at the back of the book. Since a major evolution was taking place in Lipchitz' sculpture of these years, this deviation is inex- cusable. In addition to the full page plates, there are three gatherings of illustrations in the text. The group entitled "Documentation" is incomplete and unbalanced (for a good ex- ample of photographic documentation see Ro- land Penrose, Portrait of Picasso, N.Y. Mu- seum of Modern Art, 1957). The photos grouped for subject matter and for stylistic development are small in scale, and largely unrelated to comments in the text; thus they add little. This expense might better have been applied to adding a few more large plates or for checking some of the more obvious mis- takes. Miss Patai's book is not an art-historical study although it will probably be judged in this context. Actually, it is a slightly romanti- cized biography in the manner of Irving Stone's Van Gogh and Pierre La Mure's Toulouse-Lautrec, but let me hasten to add that it is far superior in every way to these de- servingly maligned fictions. There are several reasons for its superiority. Miss Patai, a tal- ented young novelist who lives in New York, has obtained almost all of her information from Lipchitz himself. In collecting informa- tion on a living artist it is essential that one consult him on every possible point. And with Lipchitz this is eminently profitable for he is voluble, articulate and possessed of an ex- cellent memory. Yet there is an obvious risk in this process, especially with a person as impas- sioned in his beliefs and as sensitive in his responses to events as we know. Lipchitz to be. His faith in his own greatness and his sense of destiny are stated with such warmth and conviction that objectivity becomes a mere il- lusion. This same conviction sometimes makes him less than generous in his opinions of other sculpture. On the other hand, since the motiva- tion for much of his work derives from the hidden inner world of the subconscious, be- yond the limits of awareness and rational con- trol, this autobiographical source can be of very great importance in advancing the understand- ing of his sculpture. Miss Patai has tried to visualize her protagonist as others have seen him in the past, like Berthe Kitrosser, his first wife, Max Jacob, and Juan Gris. She has tried to divine his outlook on Cubism, and to piece together the various environments in which he has lived, and their influence upon him. (Curiously, neither of the authors has dealt to any great extent with the question of influences derived from other artists, although the biography carries an interesting comment on Boccioni. One attributes this omission to the reticence of Lipchitz to admit it except for Rodin. Yet Picasso, Gris, and probably other sculptors played an important role in his for- mation.) Miss Patai has made a scrupulous effort to broaden and substantiate the Lipchitz remi- niscences by extensive research on Druskie- niki, on the School of Paris, even on Mallorca and Madrid. I was surprised to learn that she had never visited any of those places. One gets a vivid impression of the village life in a small Jewish community of Lithuania, and of the inner forces, familial, spiritual, almost magical which impressed themselves on the child's memory, later to emerge as great themes in his sculpture: the mother and child, the bird woman, the embrace. In the same scrupulously documented way his career is traced through Montparnasse to Boulogne-sur-Seine, to his exodus from Paris and resettlement in the United States. One learns of his emotional strains over sickness and deaths in the family, of the spectre of Hit- ler and anti-semitism, the shock of the studio fire, the recovery at Hastings-on-Hudson, and his public life in the nineteen fifties. Miss Pa- tai has no difficulty in presenting this succes- sion of events with dramatic emphasis, but in spite of the abundance of autobiographical material, one is still faced with the problem of juxtaposing the ups and downs of a troubled life with the downright tedium of day-to-day artistic creation. This does not easily fit into a flowing narrative. To fill in the voids the bi- ographer-novelist must give play to imagination and imaginative writing. All too often this leads to flights of fancy, to passages of purple prose which do not sit well with the art his- torian. Yet it is probable that the book will find its largest audience among people interested in Lipchitz as a great sculptor, in short, other artists, art critics, art historians and their pub- lic. Similarly, this kind of writing tends to over-emphasize the tragic aspects of Lipchitz' life. He has had more than his share of sor- rows and no one would wish to belittle them, but as Lipchitz himself has frequently ob- served, he is basically an idealist and an op- timist. In face of adversity, he deliberately seeks happiness and joy in his life and in his sculpture. Miss Patai, in her effort to maintain the emotional pitch of her story, sometimes gives us a contrary impression. Since this biography deals with a living person who has a wife, daughter, neighbors, relatives, friends, and clients, both author and protagonist have deemed it desirable to gloss over some of the events of his romantic life. Ac- tually, little of consequence has been omitted, but there might have been more detailed ref- erence to his life with Berthe Kitrosser. (It is regrettable, also, that the portrait of Berthe, one of his best, was not included in the Ham- macher illustrations.) Also, in view of the close relationship between Lipchitz' inner life and his art, one is tempted to speculate about the intent and meaning of the remarkable lost- wax bronzes made in the early 'forties. Indeed, these "transparents" are among the finest love lyrics in the history of sculpture. One can only hope that later editions will fill in these lapses. In general Miss Patai has been modest in her criticism or evaluation of Lipchitz' sculp- ture. The book includes 46 illustrations and in the text there are numerous references to his work, but they are sparse and for the most part noncommital, as is no doubt proper for a writer who has not had special training or ex- perience in this field. For that reason, one is almost grateful for the author's reticence, but unfortunately, one also feels the vacuum. Lip- chitz is a great human being, but his greatness derives primarily from his sculpture. This is what brought him recognition, and it is for this he will be remembered. Fortunately, other publications provide at least a part of this missing element, not the least of them, the Ham- macher book. Thus, if read together, in spite of shortcomings noted above, the two books give us a richer and more detailed knowledge of the life and sculpture of Jacques Lipchitz than has been available before, and for this all serious students of modern art will be grateful.

Here a new pattern of our civilization has emerged: the book whale. It is the twentieth century counter- part to the illustrated Dore Bible, a status giver on the kidney shaped cocktail table. The 540 illustrations consist of excellent full page reproductions in black and white or color and in the slide-sized reference pictures of the oeuvre catalogue. This useful pattern emerged for the first time, if I am not mis- taken, in Will Grohmann's Klee book. The illustrations were printed in West Germany which means lower prices on a higher level of execution. Yet there is also an intellectual pattern to such books: factual information, mostly of a biographical nature, chronology, list of exhi- bitions, bibliography, oeuvre catalogue-this is excellent but it is not enough. Selectivity, or- ganization of the material, evaluation, are largely left to the reader. This apparent fear of the dangers of subjectivity demands less in- tellectual labor from the author and from the reader. It creates a historicism to which every- thing is equally important. It seems that it was Wilenski who introduced this trend into art history. Yet the excellent John Rewald too ART JOURNAL XXII 1 58</page></plain_text>
