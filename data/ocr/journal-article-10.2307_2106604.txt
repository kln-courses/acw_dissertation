<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION THE DURATION OF THE PRESENT As Richard M. Gale has amply shown in The Language of Time,' much of the contemporary philosophical discussion about time con- cerns the reducibility or irreducibility of McTaggart's A-series to the B-series and vice versa. Physics, mathematics, and natural science generally operate quite satisfactorily within the compass of the B- series, in which events are ordered by the relation earlier than (or later than). Ordinary language, however, reflecting our everyday ex- perience with time, recognizes another ordering, the A-series, order- ing events in terms of what is now future or present or past. This es- sential reference in A-series ordering to the token-reflexive term now, Gale contends, prevents it from being understod without remainder in terms of the B-series. On the other hand, in a more recent article' he rejects what is the most significant feature of the A-series for many thinkers: the dura- tion of the present. He argues that the durational present can be in- terpreted in terms of the punctal present which (save for its irre- ducible reference to now) has the same properties as the correspond- ing instant in the B-series: "The concept of the durational present . . . presupposes that of the punctal present, which serves as the end of the past and the beginning of the future, in that every durational use of 'the present' at the same time involves a punctal use which refers to this punctal divider. That S is Oing at present means that S has been Oing from some past time up until the present, in which the present is the punctal present."' This argument is unexceptional as long as we restrict our con- cern to the being or occurring of events. For the punctal present di- vides those events which now have being from those that do not. Since only those events have being which occur before and up to the punctal present, the durational present must be defined in terms of them. But not all concepts of the durational present accept this re- striction. If, in addition to having being or occurring, events also 1 New York Humanities Press, 1968.

For the class of events which do not now have being includes both those which are in the process of coming into being as well as those which are not yet in process of becoming. Here it is useful to make a threefold distinction between those events which already have being (the past), those com- ing into being (present), and those which neither have being nor are coming into being (future). It is this present, we contend, that is ne- cessarily durational. Unlike Gale's durational present which occurs before and up to his punctal present, this durational present has its beginning in that punctal present. In the course of his argument Gale introduces this apparent anti- nomy: 4 Thesis Whatever occurs requires a finite time in which to occur. If the present were punctal, it would not contain a finite time; and, thus, nothing could occur in the present. Since something occurs only when it is present, nothing could occur, which is absurd. Antithesis To be co-present is to be simultaneous. If the present were of finite duration, it would include successive elements. Thus, there would be successive elements that are co-present and therefore simultanous, which is contradictory. We can agree that this antinomy is merely apparent, but for different reasons. Gale attacks the thesis: Nothing can occur in the punctal present, but it can occur in a durational present as 'that which is hap- pening from some past time up until the punctal present.' Since, however, the durational present can be explained in terms of past occurring and the punctal present, it can be dispensed with. Only the punctal present is essential, and it has no duration. For us, how- ever, the necessity of a durational present concerns the coming into being of events, not their occurring. The thesis only becomes interest- ing if we amend the first sentence to read: "Whatever occurs re- quires a finite time in which to come into being." (The next two in- stances of the word 'occur' in the thesis should also be amended to 'come into being.') In that case, however, the durational present comes into being after the punctal present, and the punctal present can only divide the past from the present, not the present from the future. If these two divisions do not coincide, then the present is necessarily durational. We accept the thesis, as amended, but attack the antithesis, spe- cifically, its initial claim. Whatever is simultaneous is copresent, but 4 Ibid., p. 39.</page><page sequence="3">102 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the converse holds only if the present is reduced to the punctal pres- ent. The durational present has successive elements which cannot therefore be simultaneous. Some are earlier, some are later, but all are copresent as inhering in the same act of coming into being. While there may thus be successive phases to the coming into be- ing of an event, the atomic or epochal theory of becoming we are de- fending holds that the event (or, more properly, the occasion) occurs or acquires its being all at once. Only thus can it be a single, unified, determinate, unchanging occasion, for change is defined as the dif- ference between successive determinate occasions. There may be suc- cessive phases to the process of determination for an occasion, but not to its determinate being. Gale finds difficulties with this theory:5 According to the atomic theory of becoming an event of finite duration becomes present all at once, not successively. But the 'becoming present' of an event supposedly consists in its occurring or happening. But then an event which encompasses successive phases would occur or become present successively, and not all at once. The usual reply to this objection takes the path of obscuran- tism in which it is denied that the becoming present of an event is the same thing as its occurring, which leave us with no clear idea of what is now meant by the interrelated notions of an event and becoming. This charge of obscurantism can be sustained if, but only if, no intel- ligible distinction between 'becoming present' and 'occurring' can be entertained. The problem is that 'becoming present' is ambiguous, for it can either mean (a) becoming present, i.e., that something which once was future and will soon be past is now taking place in the present, or (b) becoming present, i.e., that something is now com- ing into being. In the first instance our attention is directed to a par- ticular temporal region whose turn has now come to appear on the stage of the present. In the second, the emphasis is placed on the on- tological emergence involved, which is found in the present simply be- cause the present is the sole locus for all becoming. Since, insofar as 'becoming present' is understood in the first sense, it is identical in meaning with 'occurring,' we must concentrate on this second sense to see if any intelligible distinction can be made. The issue can perhaps be clarified by contrasting events and sub- stances. Substances have being insofar as they endure, i.e., insofar as they constitute enduring events exhibiting in each successive mo- ment the same essential characteristics. A substance changes insofar as there are differences among the accidental characteristics of suc- cessive subevents in the same enduring event. A substance comes in- s Ibid., pp. 44 f.</page><page sequence="4">THE DURATION OF THE PRESENT 103 to being by means of that event whereby its essential characteristics are formed. That event may belong to another substance (as in the case of creation, procreation, or manufacture) or it may inhere in the initial subevent(s) of this substance itself (as in the case of gestation, growth, development, or maturation). The important point for our purposes is that the becoming of a substance lies in the occurring or the being of an event. While substances have being insofar as they endure, events have being insofar as they occur. Their occurring occupies a certain tem- poral region which is constantly shifting its reference with respect to what is now for us: sometimes future, sometimes present, sometimes past. In terms of the B-series, however, each temporal region is un- ambiguously located as earlier than, simultaneous with, or later than, every other event. Moreover, the being of an event is extensive, divi- sible into earlier and later subevents which also have being. The question raised by the atomic theory of becoming is whether events have becoming as well as being. Ordinary usage, insofar as it is wedded to traditional patterns of substance-thinking, supposes that "becoming" can only mean the "occurring" of an event, for the only actualities which come into being on that view are substances. This would be true if events were not also actualities whose coming into being must also be explained. If events are also actualities re- quiring explanation, then there must be a shift in meaning between the interrelated notions of an event and becoming. The coming into being of a substance may lie in the occurring or being of an event, but the occurring of an event is distinct from the act of becoming whereby that event acquires being. Let us assume that the act of becoming of a given event is an- other event. This would correspond to the act of becoming whereby a substance acquires being, since that is an event inhering either in some other substance or in the beginning subevent(s) of the endur- ing event which is that substance conceived temporally. Now events lying outside a given event cannot causally affect it: they are either future or contemporaneous with it (and therefore have no being rela- tive to it given relativity physics), or they lie in its past, and can therefore no longer cause it to come into being. Thus if its act of be- coming is another event, that event must lie in its beginning sub- event(s). This seems a plausible assumption, that an event comes in- to being in the moment of its origination. This, however, poses the problem for which James and White- head invoke Zeno's paradoxes. If the act of becoming for event A is</page><page sequence="5">104 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH some subevent B occurring in the beginning subevent(s) of A, then we may ask for the act of becoming for event B. Presumably this is some subevent C occurring in the beginning subevent(s) of B. This generates an infinite regress, each event presupposing some portion of itself as that which brings it into being. Whitehead takes for his example an act of becoming taking one second, whose own initiating event is its earlier half, ad infinitum. Then "if we consider the pro- cess of becoming up to the beginning of the second in question, and ask what then becomes, no answer can be given. For, whatever crea- ture we indicate presupposes an earlier creature which became after the beginning of the second and antecedently to the indicated crea- ture. Therefore there is nothing which becomes, so as to effect a transition into the second in question."' In this argument "presupposes" has the strongest possible mean- ing: that without which it could not be. Each event presupposes some earlier event as that which brings it into being. If each event requires as the cause of its own being that event which is its earlier half, and that earlier half cannot be without its own earlier half be- ing, which in turn requires its earlier half, ad infinitum, then nothing can come into being. None of these events can be because there is no first event which can be apart from some subevent which is its act of becoming. It is possible to misinterpret this argument by assuming that each event "presupposes" its earlier half only in the weak sense that the first half must first occur before the event as a whole can occur. So stated, the argument is merely a regressive version of the progressive argument given in 'Achilles and the Tortoise' and can be resolved by the same arithmetic summation procedure Whitehead proposes for that paradox.! This misreading is all the more likely because we are apt to assume that events only occur and do not become, on the grounds that becoming when associated with events refers to the be- coming of substances and this, we have seen, is achieved by the being (i.e., the occurring) of certain events. Whitehead concludes: "The argument, so far as it is valid, elicits a contradiction from the two premises: (i) that in a becoming some- thing (res vera) becomes, and (ii) that every act of becoming is divi- 6 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: Macmillan, 1929), p. 106, as emended in the "Corrigenda for Process and Reality" in Alfred North Whitehead: Essays on His Philosophy, edited by George L. Kline (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1%3), p. 204, substituting "indicated" for "earlier" in the middle sentence. 7 Process and Reality, p. 107.</page><page sequence="6">THE DURATION OF THE PRESENT 105 sible into earlier and later sections which are themselves acts of be- coming."8 Thus the coming into being of an event cannot be account- ed for in terms of one of its own earlier subevents. Whitehead further argues that each occasion is then its own act of becoming. But we could equally well conclude -that events merely occur and do not also become. There is a contradiction if what becomes is an event, but none if we restrict what can possibly come into being to substances. Then the "act of becoming" in premise (ii) can only refer to the being or occurring of events which bring substances into being, and the being of any event is infinitely subdivisible. Gale apparently construes the Racecourse argument in just this fashion, and finds no serious paradox posed by the argument without the additional unwarranted assumption that every happening can be represented as an action.' He argues that this "assumption is basic to all systems of anthropomorphic metaphysics, i.e., systems that try to explain all happenings in terms of concepts borrowed from the con- text of human experience and agency."10 Now Whitehead does general- ize from the character of human experience and agency in order to describe -the generic features of all acts of becoming, since on his the- ory of epochal becoming the only acts of becoming we could possibly experience are our own. But it would be clearly circular for him to in- voke any identification of occasions or happenings with actions in order to establish the theory of epochal becoming. I see no grounds for supposing that in fact he ever does. While the Racecourse argu- ment poses no difficulties for the infinite divisibility of the being of an event, it does introduce contradictions once we realize that the coming into being of an event must also be accounted for, insofar as we attempt to do this in -terms of other events. It is these contradic- tions Whitehead is pointing to, and these are present whether or not every happening can be represented as an action. Thus we are faced with two alternatives: (1) Events merely oc- cur, and are infinitely subdivisible into earlier and later subevents. (2) Events occur, and are so divisible, but they also come into being, and these acts of becoming are not themselves divisible into earlier and later acts of becoming. Rather the event comes into being as a whole. I interpret this to mean that while there are successive genetic phases in the process of actualization occupying the durational pres- ent of the occasion, the occasion itself first acquires being the in- 8 Ibid., p. 106. 9 "Has the Present Any Duration?", pp. 4547. 10 Ibid., p. 47.</page><page sequence="7">106 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH stant that process of becoming is completed. Thus while this dura- tional present can be genetically subdivided into earlier and later phases, these phases cannot be construed as individual acts of be- coming, since only the last one terminates in being. This is a succes- sion of more and more determinate phases culminating in that which is completely determinate, but this process of determination cannot be construed as if it were the succession of already determinate events. Once an occasion acquires being the instant its process of be- coming is completed, its being occupies the entire temporal region delimited by that process of becoming, for it is as occupying that en- tire region that the being of this (now past) event affects those events which supersede it. Once an event has being, it is a determi- nately extensive actuality, and is therefore (coordinately) divisible into equally determinate earlier and later subevents. But these earlier and later subdivisions of the event's being differ from the earlier and later phases of its becoming which are not equally determinate. It is these earlier and later phases of becoming which, though successive and hence not simultaneous, are nevertheless copresent as belonging to the same atomic act of becoming." Admittedly, this second alternative lacks the neat simplicity of the first. But it may have the advantage of doing justice to our expe- rience of temporal actualization whereby an indeterminate, open fu- ture becomes a determinate past. On the supposition that events merely occur, the past, the present, and the future are all equally de- terminate, and actualization in the present merely signifies which de- terminate events occupy the stage of the present relative to our ex- perience now. The theory is neater, but it requires us to sacrifice our direct experience of the passage of time and the openness of the fu- ture. I prefer a more complicated theory to this Procrustean bed.
