<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 4. Reformation Endings:   A Temporary Vanishing Act What Makes a Story Popular? Mind the gap. —Warning phrase on the London  Underground (1969–) Our Lady’s Tumbler has been described in ways that make its narrative seem anything  but time-bound. Yet the timelessness has hardly been unqualified and unobstructed.  As it turns out, the narrative has not been immune to the repercussions of cultural  change. For as much as one half millennium, it apparently went unrepeated in any  form—untold, unsung, unpainted, and unwritten. In all candor, the tale underwent a  death and long interment, before the investigators of literary history exhumed it and  reactivated it inside the Frankensteinian operating theater of philology. From there,  artists, especially an author, a composer, and a diva, wheeled it out on its gurney  for recuperation and rehabilitation so that it could reenter the world triumphantly  once again, as a kind of medieval revenant. Never count this story out: each time the  jongleur has pulled a vanishing act, he has popped up again—a humanized bolt from  the blue, a loose cannon in the literary canon. What makes a tale gain or lose popularity? Many storytellers, whether oral poets,  dramatists, or screenplay writers, have wrestled with this question, and laid bets on  the answer. Some have elected, or at least professed, not to care. In the case of Our  Lady’s Tumbler, we must wonder why a narrative would enjoy modest success for a  couple of centuries from around 1200 before vanishing from sight for roughly five  hundred years. Despite being anything but a hollow man, the gymnast went out not  with a bang but with a whimper. In the late Middle Ages, he performed a centuries- long disappearing act. © 2018 Jan M.

Algorithms enable nearly instantaneous  trawls through corpora of digitized texts that encompass a restricted but still  meaningful fraction of all writings published in English over the past two centuries.  The quantity suffices for generating line graphs that track the relative frequency of both  titles across time (see Figs. 4.1 and 4.2). The results show visually the diachronically  rising and falling cultural impact of individual translations, literary and musical  compositions, performers, and more. With the help of such graphic aids, we can  correlate upward and downward spikes. We can map the increasing and decreasing  effects of translations into modern languages and other artistic developments, such as  Anatole France’s adaptation, Jules Massenet’s opera, and Mary Garden’s arrogation of  the leading role in the opera to herself. When comparable tools become available for  data mining in earlier bodies of literary resources, what patterns will the ripple effects  reveal to us? So far as is now known, only two versions of our story survive from the  Middle Ages. The French one bears a different title in each of the five manuscripts.  Our textual repository could swell slightly with the discovery of a new version or  two, and I would not be surprised if someday a hitherto-unknown exemplum came  to light. In the much-quoted words of Alexander Pope, hope springs eternal. Yet even  in the most felicitous circumstances, we will never possess enough medieval evidence  of Our Lady’s Tumbler to permit credible statistical analysis. The margin of error is too  high. Literature from long ago does not always even allow the geometric certainty  that two points determine a line. Words may be made into big data, but in the end,  poetry and story—like all art—defy datification.

The thin dribble of the narrative into written culture before the Reformation indicates  much in its own right. Even before the first millennium, Marian miracles were  established in Byzantium. These tales became archetypes on which subsequent  adaptations were based in the West. The more different the versions in circulation,  the less likely a story was to ebb away altogether, either permanently or temporarily,  without being retrieved and reanimated. In contrast to the French poem, we have only  two versions of our Latin narrative, the one in a very cursory exemplum. The exiguity  of transmission made the survival of the story insecure. Rather than seek vainly for information that pertains specifically to Our Lady’s  Tumbler, we would do better to probe by comparison and analogy what we can learn  from the sizable medieval literature of Marian miracles. The distribution of this  trove across regions, languages, and literary traditions may procure at least some  enlightenment. We discover speedily that the impetus toward collecting miracles ran  particularly strong in England in the twelfth century. Yet it did not evidence itself  commensurately in the mother tongues. In fact, the meager residue of miracles of  Our Lady in medieval English and Anglo-Norman pales alongside the multitude in  Anglo-Latin versions and even alongside ones in other Western European vernaculars. The outpouring of literature, at its most intense from the late twelfth through the  thirteenth century, matched a devotion to Mary that cut across geographical, linguistic,  and social boundaries. Around the time Our Lady’s Tumbler was set down in writing,  Louis IX ruled as king of France. His piety was legendary, and he was canonized in  1297. With good reason, he is commonly designated merely as Saint Louis. Every  day he heard the offices of Our Lady. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, the Mass was  dedicated to her. On the vigils of the four principal feasts of the Virgin, the king would  </page> <page sequence="4"> 174 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 mortify his flesh. Two of the six times a year on which he took communion were  feasts of Mary. Finally, he made pilgrimages to Marian shrines such as Chartres and  Rocamadour. The Middle Ages and early modernity overlap in multiple ways. The periodization  that differentiates between them deserves to be tested and refined. In fact, it has been  so sharply faulted that some would favor scrapping any hope of a meaningful division.  All the same, the two periods still constitute distinct time zones in the evolution of  European culture. Many systems rest on gradations that can be at variance, but even  so we rely upon them. In this case, the separateness of the medieval and early modern  worlds appears strongly in religion, not only in those regions where Protestantism  threw down the gauntlet to Catholicism. During the Reformation, the whole world of faith implied in Our Lady’s Tumbler  was desecrated and deserted, deteriorated passively from dereliction, endured active  destruction, or underwent some composite of such sea changes. In England, one  important aspect of the dismantling has become known formally as the dissolution  of the monasteries. In the late 1530s, close to one thousand Catholic religious  houses were disbanded at the instigation of King Henry VIII. Among the manifold  consequences, much of medieval material and textual culture hung by a thread or  was even lost. In many places, the iconoclasm of the switch in religions obliterated  imagery that had accumulated for centuries. In architecture, the outcome was  what Ralph Adams Cram, an early twentieth-century American apologist for the  preceding medieval culture (and pre-Reformation Catholic religion), could describe  as “the eviscerated, barren, and protestantized cathedrals.” Thus, a reality wrought  by Reformation and civil war prompted William Shakespeare to allude to “bare  ruin’d choirs where late the sweet birds sang.” Throughout England, the churches of  monasteries and abbeys were dispossessed and devastated in rapid-fire succession,  with the disappearance of both the physical trappings of Catholic Christianity and  the human presence of chanting monks. True, the changes took hold to varying degrees in different locales. The baring  and the ruining were not ubiquitous. In fact, the spectrum could be large within a  country such as Germany where a geographical division emerged between Catholics  and Protestants. For all that, in general Protestantism of the time acquired an anti- Marian accent. Concomitantly, the Reformation had the effect of diminishing the  prominence of the Virgin in Christianity. Even in what remained a mainly Catholic  region such as France, medieval culture came under a cloud. More than buildings  were affected. In confronting the cult of the saints, the reformers felt bound to  reshape or eradicate shrines, relics, images, and miracle tales. Protestants were  anti-pilgrimage. A logical extension of the same compulsion was to obliterate the  narratives underpinning them. Those who disavowed Catholicism had to confront  and calumniate all these interrelated phenomena without granting a special  dispensation for the worship of Mary. The Mother of God was not given a free pass  in the sectarian violence—on the contrary. </page> <page sequence="5"> 4. Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  175 Protestant zones, and Catholic hot spots located close to the battle lines between  the factions, came to the boil. It became increasingly dangerous there to claim to have  witnessed a Marian apparition. The wrath of the Inquisition could be threatened, and  supposed visionaries were executed. At the same time, the cultures that came to be  bracketed within the catchall designation of the Middle Ages became suspect too.  Afterward, it took a long time to overcome the lingering reserve and even disdain  for the period. By the seventeenth century, French highbrows could be found who  expressed admiration for medieval times and affinity for its literature. But their  attraction skewed toward knights and the major protagonists of heroic poetry, not  toward monks and monasteries. The most intemperate reformers in England, Germany, and elsewhere, such  as Calvinists, were intent on extirpating from popular culture and discourse all  saints, but foremost among them the Virgin. They challenged the extremely slender  scriptural, and in fact primarily apocryphal, evidence undergirding some of the  beliefs and worship that had burgeoned around Mary. They paid the mother of Jesus  her due as the Mother of God, and recognized that she conceived as a virgin, but they  emphasized more vehemently than the Catholics the preeminence of Christ, and they  denied that the Virgin had escaped from original sin. To accord Mary more attention  was Romanism, papism, and idolatry. The Mother of God had been associated especially with lilies, but now the  flower show was over. After being in full bloom in the late Middle Ages, the plants  were fading fast. The second of the Ten Commandments enjoins the faithful from  worshiping graven images. Out of antipathy to idols, the reformers systematically  uprooted, tore asunder, and even incinerated the traditional cult and images of Mary  like so many overgrown weeds.  This recrudescence of iconoclasm within Christianity deprived the faithful of  the direct engagement that Madonnas facilitated with the characters and events of  the New Testament. At the same time, it ruled out the danger of ignorant believers  becoming confounded and regarding the objects themselves as inherently divine,  rather than as stepping-stones toward the divine. Along with the Virgin, the rabble- rousing reformers got rid of monastic orders, many of which had cherished a special  devotion to her. Where monasticism was outlawed, monasteries fell into abeyance  and monks disappeared. Additionally, the reform movement contributed to the  demise of jongleurs, not because of Mary but because the leaders of the Reformation  harbored general reservations about entertainment and art of all sorts. The reformers  were antitheatrical and therefore perforce antijongleur. English Protestants, whose religion acquired the backing of the state, achieved  success in their full-force and head-on assaults on the cult of the Virgin. England had  bestowed upon the Mother of God a favor second only to that for Christ himself; in  fact, the entire country had earned recognition as “Mary’s dowry” in acknowledgment  of its especial devotion to her. Two and a half centuries earlier, a bishop of Exeter  had mandated that every church in his diocese should contain an image of the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 176 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 Virgin, but now Madonnas incurred acute risk. Depictions of her and of other saints  caused consternation because of their anthropomorphism. The importation of the  Italian madonna, or “my lady,” to designate a picture or statue of Mary is attested  in England first in 1644, well after Protestantism had asserted a firm grasp there. By  then such images were alien and foreign. They were talismanic, objects possessing  extraordinary powers, whose veneration was dissonant with the anti-idolatrous and  antisuperstitious tenets of Christianity. In the fundamentalist process of editing the Virgin back to the rather faint contours  she had in scripture, the iconoclast reformers felt obliged to wipe out the images of  Mary around which para- and postbiblical traditions had ramified into a primordial  jungle. Wooden figures of the Mother and Child, enclosed often in tabernacles,  were a fixture of most English parish churches, as medieval inventories confirm.  Of all these numberless Madonnas, only one from the early thirteenth century has  survived. A particularly painful episode to contemplate is the iconophobic (or miso- iconic) vandalization of the Lady Chapel attached to Ely Cathedral (Fig. 4.3). Today  the space is strikingly austere, its niches bald of statuary. The sole representation  only accentuates both the neat-as-a-pin beauty and the unrelieved bareness. In 1541,  reformers beheaded nearly all the dozens of brightly colored statues and smashed  almost every single stained glass window that illustrated the biblical typology of the  Mother of God and her life story. In 1643, William Dowsing, as commissioner with the  charge of destroying “monuments of idolatry and superstition,” carried out a further  round of iconoclasm, with close attention to image of the Virgin Mary.

Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  177 Another notorious episode took place in England in 1538, when zealots effectively  imprisoned cult statues of the Virgin in a large storage closet known as Thomas  Cromwell’s wardrobe of beds. Eventually, they put these images on trial. The  reformers were not swayed by the defense mounted on behalf of the admittedly tight- lipped sculptures. Instead, they publicly executed them by burning. The punishment  approached state-sanctioned murder. The objects of wood and stone themselves were  almost living heretics. By having their statuesque feet put to the fire, they were treated  with no more and perhaps even less respect than what was due to common criminals.  The point was iconoclastic, to demolish the worship of idols. In that context, the  effigies were lightning rods that took a hit for the whole Catholic Church. Yet inadvertently this treatment of the images by the firebug fanatics perpetuated  the very assumptions that it sought to end. In the process, it conceded to them the status  of living beings: they were old flames in more than one sense. To the executioners, the  broiling of the representations was retributive justice. To their impassioned devotees,  the mass cremation must have seemed tantamount to martyrdom. Cult statues of the  Virgin were hauled in from such sites as Cardigan, Caversham, Coventry, Doncaster,  Ipswich, Lynn, Penrhys, Southwark, Willesden, and Worcester. Then this rogues’  gallery was raked over the coals so that Mary could go out in a blaze. To take one out  of alphabetical order, a final Madonna hailed from the most hallowed late medieval  English shrine of Our Lady, Walsingham in north Norfolk. Along with her sanctuary,  she deserves further discussion. Walsingham, England’s Nazareth The demolition of the shrine and the dispersal of its contents at Walsingham was a  singularly earth-shattering act of ruination. The Holy House and church surrounding  it have been reconstructed from their image as transmitted in the wax seals of the  medieval abbey. Despite all the care, in the replication the originals have been  reduced to the merest façade of what they once were (see Fig. 4.4). Reappearances can  be deceiving. The chapel had an elaborate foundation legend. In the account as recorded much  later, a Saxon noblewoman and widow experienced three times in 1061 a vision in  which the Virgin first transported her mystically in a true flight of fancy to the Holy  House of the Annunciation in Nazareth. Then, the Mother of God bade her to honor  the announcement of the Incarnation by erecting in Walsingham an exact replica of  the home. It would not be easy for her to determine the building site and achieve the  construction. For her pains, the visionary was assured that when built, the shrine  would enable all those who sought succor there from Mary to receive it. The prediction  came true. Between the mid-twelfth century and 1538, Walsingham became one of the  most heavily frequented sanctuaries to the Blessed Virgin in England and even in the  Christian world. The connection with the unveiling of the birth of Jesus meant that  </page> <page sequence="8"> 178 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 the Latin prayer known as the Hail Mary was held in special reverence at the chapel  and later at the priory on the spot. Among many relics, the holy place was particularly  renowned for a phial that allegedly contained milk from the Mother of God. Fig. 4.4  The remains of Walsingham Priory, Norfolk.

Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  179 Most germane to the story of Our Lady’s Tumbler is that the Holy House in Walsingham  contained a wooden majesty, with Mary on a throne with the infant Jesus seated  on her lap. The effigy may have been a Black Virgin or Black Madonna, so called  because of its dark hue, an artistic application to the Mother of God of the “I am  black but comely” image of the Bride in the biblical Song of Solomon—the closest  that the Middle Ages came to the late twentieth-century trope of “black is beautiful.”  In any event, the carving was annihilated close to a half millennium ago. Yet despite  its disappearance hundreds of years before now, we can still form a picture of the  Walsingham statue thanks to a representation of it on a seal from the late twelfth or  early thirteenth century (see Fig. 4.5). Other portrayals are found on the badges of  lead or pewter that were retailed as souvenirs to pilgrims. Such tokens could prove  that a person had completed a pilgrimage to a given destination. In addition, they  could convey the grace of the Virgin to those who encountered them. Other similar  keepsakes included pewter flasks. These vessels contained water from the holy wells  that were located not far from the shrine. In many regards, these objects functioned  as amulets. The foot traffic of pilgrims to what became the Augustinian priory grew extremely  heavy in the late Middle Ages. Walsingham developed into the principal Marian  destination in England. The growth in movement gave rise to a rat-a-tat drumbeat of  criticism even before the Reformation. In 1356, the Archbishop of Armagh delivered a  sermon in which he denounced worship by those who failed to distinguish between  a Madonna and the Virgin Mary in heaven herself. By his lights, images of this sort  included the representations of Saint Mary at Lincoln, Newarke in Leicester, and  Walsingham. Further, he charged the custodians of such holy places with fomenting  miracles so as to pad their own coffers. A chronicler described how the Lollard  iconomachs slurred the Virgin of Walsingham by calling her in vernacular English  “the Witch of Walsingham.” These followers of John Wycliffe protested against the  custom of referring to the cult image as “our dear Lady of Walsingham” rather than as  “our dear lady of heaven.” Likewise, they condemned it as “vain waste and idle to trot  to Walsingham rather than to each other place where an image of Mary is.” To such  dissenters, an image is an image is an image: local images and relic cults have no point. The Renaissance humanist Erasmus gives a detailed picture of Walsingham and  his observations when he made a pilgrimage to the site in the summer of 1512, in  appreciation of the success that the Church scored against the schismatic King Louis  XII of France. The Dutchman’s portrayal of his experience is far from altogether  positive. He characterizes the community as depending wholly on revenue from  pilgrims. His account of their moneymaking machine is acerbic and sharp-tongued,  with flashes of hilarious comedy. His hard-edged description of the shrine gives vent  to his distaste for the popular devotion of the late Middle Ages. In his finickiness,  he shrank back from the physicality of the practices that the canaille pursued. Thus  he conjures up vividly, and mostly not flatteringly, the lighting, smells, and even  </page> <page sequence="10"> 180 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 tactile qualities of the objects and spaces involved in the expression of lay piety. In  other words, he executes the mental process of sensory integration, by which he  makes meaning from information collected by his senses. This is what common sense  is all about. He describes the windowless chamber where the image was domiciled,  probably with curtains or a canopy billowing around it. This separate space was the  original Holy House, which by Erasmus’s time had been encased in a far larger chapel.  In it, the light of shimmery candles reflected from scores of gold and jewel objects,  alongside masses of humbler oblations. Erasmus gives us to believe that despite all  the blazing tapers, the inner sanctum offered to the spirit more heat than light. As a pilgrimage site, Walsingham may be usefully compared with Loreto. The  Italian town is by many accounts home to the Holy House. This structure purports to be  the home in Nazareth in which Mary was born and raised, received the Annunciation,  and lived during the childhood and after the ascension of Jesus. The little building  has drawn pilgrims since at the latest the fourteenth century. It was transported, so  the story goes, from the Virgin’s hometown on the wings of angels to rescue it from  infidels. The timing may not be purposeless. The movement began only three years  after 1291. That date saw the toppling of Acre, the tail end of the crusader kingdoms  in the Holy Land. The retreating campaigners could have transported with them from  Nazareth stones from the edifice where the angel Gabriel broke the news to Mary that  she would conceive and become the Mother of God. Alternatively, they could have  brought back the trauma of having abandoned the house and other important sites  to the Muslims. They could have assuaged at least partially the hurt of loss through  wish-fulfillment, in the fantasy of the angelic levitation. Whatever the historical realities of the building and its move, the Holy House  offered within the bounds of the European landmass a destination for Christian  pilgrims who could no longer venture safely into the Holy Land after the collapse  of the crusader states. It became notable in the late fifteenth century. After the  destruction of Walsingham, it had every basis on which to surge in popularity. At first,  the Holy House was a simple edifice. The chief adornments were a statue of the Virgin  beside an altar and a blue-painted ceiling spangled with golden stars. Eventually,  the domicile was enclosed within a larger building, and the image of Mary shifted  to a plush, jewel-lined niche. This Madonna is held to have been a Black Virgin. A  holy card from 1899 illustrates the scene in tacky pastel colors, with a German legend,  “Miraculous Transportation of the Holy House to Loreto” (see Fig. 4.6). Despite undeniable parallels between Walsingham and Loreto, the two shrines  diverged in major ways. For one, the scale of the Holy House of Nazareth in the Italian  hilltown differed substantially from the one in England. In contrast, the dimensions of  the Santa Casa (to use the Italian name for the stone building in Loreto) corresponded  reasonably closely to those of the fourteenth-century Slipper Chapel in Walsingham  (see Fig. 4.7). This other church, so called because it marked the point at which  pilgrims removed their shoes to trudge in their stocking feet to the Holy House itself,  was located about a mile south of Walsingham proper. </page> <page sequence="11"> 4.

As  elsewhere, candle devotion was central to the cult of the Virgin at Walsingham. By  no mere coincidence, the statue of Our Lady there was taken away to be consumed  by fire in the aftermath of a royal injunction in 1538, “Forbidding the Placing of  Candles before Images and Other Superstitious Practices.” Tapers figured largely in  the monarchs’ generosity to the shrine. King Henry III, the first royal to come, paid  at least thirteen visits, with the initial one in 1226. In 1240, for the feast of the Virgin’s  Conception, he ordered two thousand votives to be burned there and at Bury St.  Edmunds. In 1246, he commissioned a golden crown to be placed upon the head  of the Madonna at Walsingham. In 1251, he spent the feast of the Annunciation on  pilgrimage there, and made the gift of both two silver candlesticks and a valuable  chasuble of red samite. King Edward I betook himself to the shrine twice, the second  time on Candlemas Day in 1296. The candlelight can be pictured easily that would  have coruscated when the feast of this holiday was celebrated. King Henry VII came  no fewer than four times. King Henry VIII of England, who was responsible for the  demise of the statue and much else in the community, paced barefoot two miles to  reach the site in 1511, made lavish donations there, and kindled a candle before the  Madonna in March 1538. The character Avarice in William Langland’s late fourteenth-century personification  allegory Piers Plowman takes a pledge that reflects the author’s reprobation of the  motivations that propelled pilgrims to make the trek to Walsingham. The mention  of a peregrination there had a special cachet. Of course, worshipers also journeyed  to other sites relating to the Virgin in England as well as on the continent. For  example, rich documentation survives on Marian pilgrimage in late medieval and  early modern Germany. Such voyages eventuated in an unalterable syllogism:  pilgrimages led to shrines, and such holy places (above all, ones connected with  Mary) centered upon images. For the reformers, the counter-syllogism was patent: to  end such veneration, desacralize its objectives. The corollary was equally unmissable:  to desecrate sanctuaries, destroy Madonnas. In the Reformation, modernizing meant  de-Madonna-izing. Toward the end of 1538, the reformist bishop of Worcester Hugh Latimer (see  Fig. 4.8) notoriously decreed that the image of the Virgin in his diocese—and others,  including the one at Walsingham—should be charred. Latimer addressed the letter in  question to none other than to Thomas Cromwell, chief minister of King Henry VIII.  The bishop’s aspiration was soon fulfilled. The incineration of the carvings, and the  shutting down of all shrines in England, were concomitants to the suppression and  dissolution of the monasteries. Henry VIII ordered these draconian acts in 1536 and  1539, and Cromwell oversaw them as agitator-in-chief. The aftereffects included the  abandonment and devastation of many abbeys. The figure of Our Lady of Walsingham  was abducted to be put to the torch; the swank sanctuary was first despoiled of its  </page> <page sequence="13"> 4. Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  183 gold and silver ornaments and then dismantled; and the priory and its dependencies  were largely razed and abandoned. The sites and image of Our Lady that can be seen  today are anything but original. Rather, they have resulted from a Marian revival in  Britain that has been supported by the papacy since the late nineteenth century. Fig. 4.8  Unknown artist, Hugh Latimer, late sixteenth century.

The Madonnas that have been enumerated were neither the first nor the only ones to  suffer the fate of destruction. When the impetus to remake the fabric of the Church  was taken very literally, many others were denuded of their garments, irreparably  mangled, or even summarily destroyed in expressions of iconoclasm by the riffraff. In  England, a hard-edged campaign was waged against what was regarded as Mariolatry,  the according to Mary of worship due to God and God alone. The first bout of statue-tory abuse extended to the removal in 1535 of an Our Lady’s  girdle, worn by expectant mothers to help them in their pregnancies and especially  in childbirth. Often effigies suffered radical mastectomies in which their breasts  were stabbed or hacked off. Their arms were severed and their faces defaced. The  representations of the infant Jesus that they held were cut away. In 1581, for instance,  the Virgin and Child along with other figures were subjected to what might be called  holy (or unholy) vandalism wrought upon the Cheapside Cross in London. In a  renovation, the Madonna was replaced by a semi-nude image of the Roman goddess  Diana. Later, the Mary was reinstalled but after twelve nights she was de-crowned,  beheaded, and shorn of her offspring. Another relatively late manifestation of the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 184 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 iconoclasm came in 1578, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, nearly two decades  after she succeeded her Catholic half sister Mary to the throne in 1559. While touring  Norfolk near Thetford, the ruler made what was presented as being a chance discovery.  In a hay house, she happened upon an image of Our Lady that she considered an idol,  and she had it carbonized. The sixteenth century lacked most of the devices that are for the taking today to  record and document such barbarism visually. Yet around 1570, an unknown artist  captured a scene of iconoclasm within a picture painted with oil paints. The panel  depicts the young King Edward VI receiving the blessing of a bedridden Henry VIII  and the Pope, who along with the monks to his right is being crushed by the Bible  (see Fig. 4.9). Through a window, reformers are visible outside. The two nearest tug  on ropes to tip and overthrow a statue of the Virgin and Child. Not only in England  did what could be called Mariaphobia express itself in anti-Marian iconoclasm. In  Germany, one excruciating act of such Madonna mayhem put in the crosshairs not a  statue but a painting. An artwork of the Virgin and Child by the artist Hans Holbein  the Elder suffered destruction in the cathedral in Augsburg in 1537. In some locations,  images of Mary became the objects of literal tugs-of-war between opposing factions of  Protestant reformers and Roman Catholics. What have been nicknamed “cults of battered Marys” arose. All over Europe,  Protestant hooligans would subject to misuse and mutilation Madonnas that would  be rescued and sometimes repaired by Catholic handymen of holiness. Thus, specific  representations of Our Lady endured abuse in Paris repeatedly, in Geneva, and in the  English College Chapter of Valladolid (see Fig. 4.10). Mistreatment of a similar sort was  supposedly meted out to depictions of the Virgin during conflicts between Catholics  and Protestants in the nineteenth century in England. By the mid-seventeenth century,  a census of images would have found their number and distribution pared back  sharply because of iconoclastic reformers. In the 1650s, a Jesuit tallied over one thousand Marian shrines, providing for each a  brief history and an engraving of its Madonna (see Figs. 4.11 and 4.12). The four-digit  headcount is remarkable. As a sequel, the author drew up a discrete index containing  a subsection listing wounded Virgins, as well as taxonomies of weapons wielded  against them, portions of the likenesses that suffered thuggery, types of damage, and  kinds of action taken by Mary in response to the contusions. A roll call taken in the  early nineteenth century in France would have tabulated another sharp drop, since  the French Revolution brought about the destruction of the effigies and relics that  had outlasted the Reformation. Across the ages, Madonnas that have demonstrated  a special capacity to withstand persecution have become the objects of popular  devotion, legends, and superstitions. We will see medieval images that demonstrated  impressive skills as proto-survivalists, but for the present let us focus on the twentieth  and twenty-first centuries. </page> <page sequence="15"> 4.

Madonnas of the World Wars A man is ready to leap to his death from a tall building.  An Irish policeman barrels up and yells, “Don’t do it!  Think of your mother!” The man answers, “My mother’s  dead; I am going to do it.” The cop says, “What about  your father?” “He left when I was a baby.” The cop goes  down the list with no success until finally he shouts,  “Don’t jump! Remember the Blessed Virgin!” The would-be  suicide asks, “Who is that?” The officer answers, “Jump,  Protestant! You’re blocking traffic!” Mary is an obvious dividing line between Protestants and Catholics. After the  Reformation, the disparity between the two branches of Christianity sharpened.  Among other changes, different regions became distinguished by the absence or  presence of the Virgin on street corners, in statues or paintings. To Protestants, the  sight of such images grew to be unfamiliar in every respect, whereas to Catholics in  many places, these representations were unexceptional and even humdrum in daily  life. In 1859, Henry Adams commented upon the “old road-side saints, crucifixes and  </page> <page sequence="17"> 4. Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  187 Madonnas” that he encountered in the German region of Franconia, which he would  never have seen in New England. During World War I, such sculptures and pictures  belonged to the religious paraphernalia of Catholicism that took doughboys from the  United States and their equivalents from other predominantly Protestant countries by  surprise. Those soldiers who had been born and bred Catholic were more accustomed  to the trappings of Marianism. On both the front lines and the home front in France, Catholic Germany, and  elsewhere, people were likelier in wartime to turn for comfort to the Mother of God  than at any time since the years surrounding the Franco-Prussian war. Military  conflict, political tension, and economic desperation have often furnished a powerful  recipe for sightings of the Virgin and for miracles associated with her and with her  representation in Madonnas. Our Lady of Fátima in Portugal was the foremost case  in point. A cult arose there from appearances of Mary to three shepherd children that  took place once a month over one half year in 1917. This manifestation of the Virgin  was later made the basis for what became effectively a Marian Cold Warrior, since for  the first few decades in the second half of the twentieth century the message of Fátima  was construed as a denunciation of Communism and the Soviet Union. Particularly awesome in the apocalyptic land- and cityscapes of World War I were  postbellum representations of images that appeared to have been spared divinely  from mangling or burning after bombardment. For instance, a statue miraculously  unaffected by the fracas of warfare was the Mary of Igny, a thirteenth-century jewel  in the crown, which came through without a scratch despite all the harm inflicted  upon Reims cathedral by bombs and fire in September 1914 (see Fig. 4.13). Another  such representation was a carving of Notre Dame of Lourdes that stood on the altar  of the Holy Virgin in the church of Bouchoir in Picardy, which was shelled in the  Battle of the Somme (see Fig. 4.14). On a postcard the caption explains: “The shrapnel  exploded in the war and destroyed everything in front of the statue. The Virgin was  touched by neither the shrapnel nor the stones that came loose all around her head.” A third survivor was a gilded Madonna, sometimes called the “Divine Shepherdess,”  that crowned the basilica of Notre-Dame de Brebières. This sizable house of God was  built in the modest town of Albert in Picardy at the end of the nineteenth century to  replace the parish church that had grown too cramped to accommodate pilgrims. The  worshipers who descended upon the basilica were caught up in the Marian fervor  connected with the sites of apparitions of the Mother of God at La Salette and Lourdes.  This sanctuary became an objective because it housed the Black Virgin after which  it was named. The Madonna in question is so called after the small community of  Brebières. The noun, meaning “pastures,” derives from the French brebis, or “sheep.”  The onomastic lore is not beside the point. After all, legend held that this representation  of Notre Dame was unearthed in a field near the town by a shepherd whose flock kept  returning to the same patch of tufts of verdant grass. When the herdsman clawed at  the sod with a hoe, the tool banged upon a statue of the Virgin and Child that had  been buried there. </page> <page sequence="18"> 188 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 Fig. 4.13  Postcard depicting a damaged thirteenth- Fig. 4.14  Postcard depicting a ruined chapel of  century statue of the Virgin after the bombardment the church of Bouchoir, with the miraculously  of Reims (Paris: H.

The dome supporting it was struck in howitzer  and mortar shelling by German artillery in 1914, during the Battle of the Somme (see  Fig. 4.15). Despite being hit, the artwork was not destroyed. Nor did it plummet to the  earth, but dropped more than ninety degrees to dangle slightly below parallel to the  ground. From its posture it become world-famous as the Leaning or Golden Virgin  of Albert (see Fig. 4.16). To many members of the military, the representation was  part and parcel of their first exposure to Catholicism, whose beliefs, practices, and  expressions seemed exotic and alien. The combatants developed many interpretations  of the Madonna’s circumstance. Apparently her stance could mean almost anything,  except nothing. To one, she looked to be leaning down to snag the Child, like a fallen  infantryman. To others, she was presenting him as a sacrifice or as a peace offering  to expedite the close of the war. To saltier wits, the destabilized statue looked like  a flunking phallus as it flopped flaccidly at less than half mast. Not accepting that  sometimes a statue lolling below the horizontal is just a statue lolling below the  horizontal, she was dubbed the “Lady of the Limp.” </page> <page sequence="19"> 4.

One was that the battle royale would end  when the statue finally fell. The other held that the side to bring her down would lose  in the conflict. Neither superstition was borne out. What was the upshot, so to speak?  To begin with ballistics, the Virgin remained attached to the dome until annihilated  by British heavy guns in 1918. The war stretched out for a little while, and the Allies  carried the day. In the meantime, the mangled Madonna had not fifteen minutes of  fame but four years of it. During that stretch, it became known worldwide through  postcards dispatched from the battlefront to the home front. Many belligerents saw  the statue in its partly unglued condition and shared the experience with far-off  friends and family in their own countries by mailing images. Eventually a replica, no  longer drooping, was put back in place when the basilica was reconstructed from 1927  to 1931. World War I did not mark the end of miraculously preserved Marian images.

Nearly seventy years later, in October 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the  spit of land in Queens, New York, known as Breezy Point. Its gusting wind and storm  surge left tremendous havoc in their wake. Torrential rains gave way to even worse.  The windblown and waterborne disrepair was compounded by the conflagration that  burned uncontrolled afterward. One house at the corner of Oceanside Avenue and  Gotham Walk was among the more than one hundred homes fried to ashes. Even so,  the site became a cause for hope. Amid all the rubbish from the destruction, a statue  of the Virgin that had been placed in a niche in the garden was somehow left upright  and intact (see Fig. 4.18). Whether by fluke or by miracle, the future will no doubt also  have its share of Marys uninjured after catastrophes, and those images too will be  made rallying points for survivors.

Sometimes the clampdown probably took place through the handling or mishandling  of manuscripts by the reformers. A 1535 letter to Thomas Cromwell from a royal  commissioner lists among items seized from a monastic library during a visitation “a  book of Our Lady’s miracles, well able to match the Canterbury Tales; such a book  of dreams as you never saw, which I found in the library.” The only record of a  Marian miracle text to be so confiscated, this missive to the Vicar General—despite its  reference to Chaucer—leaves unclarified whether the volume is long or short, Latin  or vernacular, prose or verse; nor do we come to know what fate it endured. The  invocation of the Canterbury Tales, along with the categorization of the miracles as  a dreambook, signal the letter writer’s belief that legends of Mary are nothing more  than vaporous fiction.  The disappearance of the tales may not be described as bonfires of virginities or  even just of images. Unwritten or seldom written narratives are erased not by torches  or sledgehammers, but through suppression and silence. All the same, tales that center  on devotion to images will fare poorly in times of image-breaking. Theologians may  draw fine distinctions between veneration rendered to images, known technically  as iconodulia, and outright worship of images, or iconolatry, but others would not  necessarily find much relevance in such casuistry. To them, the two practices look very  similar, if not even synonymous. Furthermore, the goal of iconoclasm was not merely  to rid churches of physical representations, but to rewire the devotional system within  which they functioned. Nor did the assault on iconodulia and iconolatry stop there.  The likenesses might be turned to cold cinders and smoldering embers; the liturgies  associated with them might be discarded and outlawed—for all that, it took much  longer and more sustained efforts to sear recollection and to scour mental images of  them from minds. An Elizabethan ballad concluded with two lugubrious stanzas of valediction to the  Walsingham Madonna. The lines decried the satanic sin that moved in to occupy the  spiritual space vacated by the destruction of the image. Still greater impact came from  a ballad that recorded the story of the disappearance. The song places special emphasis  on miracles of healing and revivification that the carving enabled. One of Cromwell’s  agents, Sir Roger Townsend, wrote to him about a woman whose chattiness about the  sculpture brought unpleasant consequences down on her. She gossiped about what  he regarded as a “false tale of a miracle done by the Image after it had been carried  away.” For this jabbering, she received the penalty of being placed in the stocks and  then drawn around the marketplace in a cart with a paper hat on her head to identify  her as a “reporter of false tales.” Even so, the Lord Protector’s henchman remained  of two minds. Had he extirpated the memory of the Walsingham Madonna or not? “I  cannot help but perceive that the aforesaid image is not yet out of some of their heads.”  One of the crania at issue belonged to another local lady who also was convinced,  </page> <page sequence="23"> 4. Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  193 even after the statue had been taken down and transported to London, that it had  wrought a miracle. Like the above-mentioned teller of falsities, this poor Mariophile  got more than a mere rap on the knuckles: she was put in the pillory on market day at  Walsingham and then carted around to be pelted with snowballs. Language was affected as well by the ruthless about-face. Obviously, the learned  language of Latin would have been laundered of many features associated with the  Catholic Church, but the vernacular did not escape untouched either. Any major  alteration of a society requires modifications of speech and writing, both high and  low. Reformers wished to scotch the invocation of saints, including the Mother of  God, so as to train the sights of the faithful upon God and Christ. The commoners of  the late Middle Ages prayed most often to the Virgin. To exemplify how improper and  unbecoming such invocations could be, Erasmus derided the prayers of a mercenary  who had impudently called upon Mary, “Blessed Virgin, give me rich spoils.” In fact,  the Dutch scholar went so far as to quote putative direct appeals from the Mother of  God herself in a letter against the shameless and unprincipled entreaties lodged with  her. Folks who invoked Mary aloud in prayer were reproved, and subtle changes were  wrought in the psalter to constrict the powers ascribed to the Virgin. The eradication  of saints from language would find its most telling confirmation in an exception to  the rule. According to a widely accepted etymology, the slang expletive bloody is a  minced oath that originated in the phrase “by Our Lady.” From the measureless sea  of saints’ invocations, only this one dysphemism survived. It remained in existence  only because its very meaning and provenance became unrecognizable, its vestiges of  religiosity trumped by its coincidental blot of vulgarism. On a narrative level, a similar bowdlerization may have played out in some  stories by replacing Mary and other saints either with nothing at all or with figures  sanitized to be presentable within a Protestant context. Mainly what happened was  the expunction that results from censorship, both self-imposed and otherwise. The  sorts of narratives that would once have commanded respect and awe came to be  derided. The atmosphere would have brought Marian miracle tales at full tilt to  oblivion. For example, the Protestant bishop John Bale heaps mockery upon a vision  that was reputedly experienced in 1470 by the Dominican theologian Alanus de Rupe.  Female virgin saints are often supposed to undergo mystical marriages, in which  Christ appears to them and places a ring upon their fingers as a sign that he is taking  them as mystical brides. That is all very well, but in this case Blessed Alanus claimed  in writing to have received a house call from the Virgin, who placed a ring on his  finger, encircled his neck with a necklace braided of her hair, and presented him with  a rosary (see Fig. 4.19). Bale’s restatement of the events puts a different, salacious,  even tawdry spin on the symbiosis between the Roman Catholic theologian and a  touchy-feely Mary. In the English churchman’s interpretation of Alanus’s account of  the episode, the Mother of God came to the friar’s cell and made her gifts to him so  that they might plight their troth. Then the proceedings take a decidedly deviant turn.  Alanus first fondles his visitor’s breasts, then engages in sexualized breast-feeding,  and finally progresses to actual coitus, all somehow without de-virginating the Virgin. </page> <page sequence="24"> 194 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 Fig. 4.19  Guido Reni, Madonna col Bambino in gloria e i santi Petronio, Francesco, Ignazio,  Francesco Saverio, Procolo e Floriano, 1631–1632.

Image from Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/ wiki/File:Guido_Reni_057.jpg In Protestant theology, saints, among whom Mary was foremost, lost their stature  as mediators between God and people. Since Christ alone fulfilled that function, the  Mother of God was decentered as the object of special devotion. In the Middle Ages,  the Virgin stood supreme as mediator above all others. By the thirteenth century, her  ascendancy made her almost a fourth person of the Trinity. For centuries afterward,  she retained this lofty status, to the abiding scandal of non-Catholics. Even in the mid- nineteenth century, a Protestant magazine in England reported on an Irish immigrant  who allegedly considered Mary to be a member of the Trinity. This same elevated status was reflected in the reverence the Mother of God received  throughout the later Middle Ages in her images, Madonnas. Protestant reformers  condemned the cult of the Blessed Virgin as a form of respect gone too far—as  adoration that verged on adulation and idolatry. In Catholic theology, the Ecumenical  Council of Trent, which extended from 1545 to 1563, brought reform. Most relevantly,  it reaffirmed the importance of the veneration of saints, particularly the cult of Mary.  At the same time, the Council laid great emphasis on the legitimate use of images,  including those of the Virgin. It emphasized that honor shown to the representations is  referred to the prototypes represented by them. The faithful do not worship, petition,  or trust the Madonna itself, but rather the Mother of God represented by it. Even in  northern Europe Mary was never altogether ousted among Catholics as happened to  a great degree in Protestantism. Yet despite the Trentine reform, she was nonetheless  sometimes shunted aside in favor of a Christocentric viewpoint. </page> <page sequence="25"> 4. Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  195 Some jongleurs would have suffered the same diminishment, if not demise, as  befell the Virgin, Madonnas, and texts about her. The reason is not far to see. The  performers would have been linked with the pilgrims and preachers who teamed up  to spread her cult. In effect, the entertainers belonged to the whole, vast pilgrimage  industry that reformers were keen to exterminate. This is why around 1546, the English  clerk William Thomas fawns upon King Henry VIII for having investigated the many  malfeasances of the friars, whom Thomas calls jugglers. The tumbler and his like had  been popular at certain times because the Virgin and he had been believed in tandem.  Now the equal and opposite came true. He became unpopular as Marian miracles fell  into disbelief and as Mary herself faded from the ubiquity she had achieved between  the twelfth century and the late Middle Ages. Among Protestants, Mary held an ambiguous position. Her cult was roundly  castigated. As an object of study and devotion, English writers strikingly avoided her  for hundreds of years after the Reformation. The publication in 1827 of John Keble’s  Christian Year marks the commencement of the Marian revival in nineteenth-century  England. To look at the situation somewhat differently, in many places the Virgin was  largely excluded from the transition that led from manuscript to print culture. Miracle  tales dropped out of vogue just as the presses began to bring forth torrents of books.  Yet even within Protestantism, the Mother of God was not universally thrust aside as  almost all other saints were cast away. A cleavage is perceptible between Lutheranism,  in its defense of Mary, and Calvinism, in its assaults on her. Martin Luther, who  himself owned an image of the Virgin and Child, argued that iconoclasts should spare  Madonnas, since they could serve as devotional aids. At the same time, the German  reformer commented with disapproval on images that depicted the lactation of  Bernard of Clairvaux, in which the so-called Marian Doctor is represented receiving  a spurt of milk from the Virgin’s breast. Thanks to Luther’s generally supportive  outlook, Marian images continued to be fabricated and displayed in some places. Even  so, they came with the caveat, explicit in inscriptions or implicit in doctrine, that the  Mother of God was to be honored but not worshiped. The emphasis on reverencing  her was codified in Luther’s writing. In a commentary he opined at length about the  type of veneration and lauds to be given to the Virgin. She is cherished most truly by  honoring the Almighty. If esteem and praise are accorded to her, the objective is to  attain God through it. For all the support that the reformer offered, Lutherans have retained their  discomfort with freestanding statues of Mary as potentially idolatrous. The lingering  worry about the verisimilitude of this three-dimensional form of Madonna may help  to explain why in the one recent retelling of our tumbler’s story for children by a  Swedish artist and author, the carving is replaced by a painting. For that matter, in  its title the book makes no mention of the Mother of God, the Virgin, or a Madonna,  and the illustrations on its dust jacket avoid representing any of them as well. These  omissions need not be driven explicitly by religion, but by general cultural context.  Sweden has been predominantly Lutheran since the sixteenth century. Outside a  </page> <page sequence="26"> 196 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 denominational context, the self-serving inconsistency of Christian views on idolatry  has long attracted remark within the framework of world religions: “We sneer when  we read of some Indian spinning tops before his child god Krishna, but we weep over  the story of the jongleur de Notre Dame and await with sympathy the Madonna’s  approval of his pathetic juggling.” Marian Apparitions The tale of Our Lady’s Tumbler belongs to a vast complex of medieval narratives and  images connected with the intervention of heaven upon earth through appearances of  Mary. In fact, it falls within the far larger category of Marian apparitions. At the latest  tally, counted down to the present day, more than 2,500 have been reported. Visions,  shrines, relics, and images of the Virgin interact with each other in constantly varying  but often intersecting ways. If Mary and Madonnas have been shrouded in clouds of  misgivings within a large part of Christianity since the Reformation, so too have been  attitudes toward phantasms of the Virgin. Direct physical experiences of her, such as  seeing her, hearing her, and being touched by her, were everywhere in the medieval  period, as for example at Loreto and Walsingham, but they have been primarily a  Catholic phenomenon since then. The basics of an official policy emerged only long  after the Middle Ages in the writings of the future Pope Benedict XIV (see Fig. 4.20). Fig. 4.20  Pierre Subleyras, Benedictus XIV, eighteenth century. Oil on canvas.  Palace of Versailles. Image from Wikimedia Commons, https://commons. wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Benoit_XIV.jpg Marian apparitions remain objects of fascination and perplexity, as much within  the Catholic Church as without. What passes muster as an apparition? A definition,  probably unhelpfully short, would be that it is a private revelation. A longer version  would hold it to be a type of vision in which someone claims to see a person, being, or  object that would not normally be apprehensible to the visionary. The degree to which  </page> <page sequence="27"> 4. Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  197 such sightings are corporeal or incorporeal can be hard to gauge. When manifestations  of this kind are not documentably physical and leave no material traces, they may be  differentiated from statues that move or crybaby paintings that shed a monsoon of  tears or blood. Many iterations of the story of the jongleur are unusually elliptical about the  relationship between the Madonna, which is an image, and the Virgin herself. The  ambiguity only increases because we are left in limbo as to whether the performer  himself or just the onlooking monks witnesses the apparition, whether either the  animation of the image or the appearance of Mary has happened before, or whether  the miracle (or is it two?) has been performed to teach a lesson to the monk-voyeurs. The overwhelming majority of Marian apparitions have become unwanted  stepchildren of the Church. Even so, the most successful ones resulted in the foundation  of sanctuaries that are magnets for pilgrimage. An early instance would be the showing  of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico (see Figs. 4.21 and 4.22). (The location in the  New World has significance, since it places the miracles far from the friction between  Catholics and Protestants in Europe. The natives who were converted because of it  knew nothing of iconoclasm within Christianity, only of Christian militancy against the  idols of pre-Christian religions—heathenism.) According to official accounts, a maiden  appeared on the morning of December 9, 1531 to Juan Diego. The Virgin directed this  native American convert to Christianity to collect blossoms from the top of the nearby  eminence. Despite the wintry season, he found Castilian roses flowering there. At least  since the Middle Ages these beauties have been associated with Mary, as have lilies.  Both blooms have insinuated themselves, sometimes with sub rosa stealth, into many  versions of the narrative about the juggler of Our Lady.

The Mother of God arranged the colorful harvest in Juan Diego’s tilma, or “cloak.”  When he opened the mantle before the archbishop, the petals fell out. What is more,  the fabric of the garment was discovered to bear the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.  The miraculous pictorial representation on the cloth has been revered ever since in  the Chapel of the Virgin Mary in Tepeyac, which was constructed for mounting and  displaying it. The depiction relates intriguingly to the so-called Black Virgins of earlier  centuries, since the complexion of this Madonna is dark, often brought home in mass- produced images through the addition of black eyelashes. The Virgin of Guadalupe is  sometimes designated affectionately among Spanish speakers as La Morenita, literally  “the Little Moor,” to suggest by extension “the Little Dark One.” After the Virgin of Guadalupe, a gap of a few centuries ensues in high-profile Marian  apparitions. A later example is Our Lady of Lourdes in France, connected especially  with the showing of Mary on February 11, 1858 to Bernadette Soubirous. A third case  is that of Our Lady of Fátima in Portugal, as noted above, based on appearances of the  Mother of God to three shepherd children, with the central visionary being a ten-year- old shepherdess. Their sightings took place on the thirteenth day of six sequential  months, beginning on May 13 and ending on October 13, 1917 (see Figs. 4.23, 4.24  and 4.25). This vision exhorted the young ones who saw her to be conscientious in  reciting their rosaries, and even called herself Our Lady of the Rosary.

If it is painless to see why Our Lady’s Tumbler could not survive in Protestant regions,  the explanation for why the story dropped out of vogue in Catholic regions may seem  harder to fathom. Then again, consider a paradox that makes the tale profoundly  unsettling. Our Lady’s Tumbler could not be more deeply imbued with organized  religion. After all, the events take place within a monastery and all its chief characters  save one are monks. At the same time, that one exceptional individual, not just a  mere layman but even the humblest sort of one, attains direct contact with the sacred.  Furthermore, his interaction is unmediated by a priest or any other representative  of the Church—apart, of course, from the mediation of the mediator par excellence,  the Virgin Mary herself. If we make the improbable leap of drawing an analogy  based on present-day corporations, we could put the dilemma into the tracery of an  organizational chart. By the vow of obedience, a monk, even a lay brother, in a matrix  structure would report formally to the abbot as manager, but also to God and through  God to others such as Mary. The tumbler’s relationship with Mary would be a solid  line, that with the man who heads his abbey dotted. The ecclesiastical hierarchy  stipulated the reverse. Our Lady’s Tumbler is about prayer, devotion, and worship. Simultaneously, it  illustrates how those acts do not require learning, Latin, or priests. In contradistinction,  it implies that praying has the objective of transcending mere linguistic signification  and verbal pronouncement so as to achieve silent communion. In rallying words to  conjure up the movements of an acrobatic dancer, the poem has enormous graphic  power. Yet in its content and outcome, it subverts its own potential as a text by flatly  denying or at least depreciating the very importance of writing and even language  more broadly. Ultimately, the narrative’s message is that to be saved, the only  necessity is to curry favor with the Mother of God, whose intercession can accomplish  anything. As a rule, the Virgin never forsakes a votary. Obeisance done to her is done  at the same time to the Child, through whom grace and salvation come, since Mary’s  prayers to her son carry a special weight. The infant Jesus is not mentioned in the  medieval French poem, nor even Mary’s status as mother. All the same, they are both  singularly important. They are left unsaid only because they are givens. The tumbler does not know his catechism, or at least not his monastery’s Latin  one. What is more, he has the insouciance to reach out directly in worship to the  Virgin, by performing a trifling act, the only form of devotion feasible for him. Yet  his personalized trivial pursuit turns out to succeed far better than all the elaborate  liturgy of his fellow monks. He undergoes a deeply personal conversion, and he  expresses his reverence through a faith based on experience. His sincerity is deemed  meet and proper by Mary, who bestows her renowned clemency on him. The lesson  is a typically Protestant one: when everything is taken into account, what matters is  inner spirit rather than outer formalism.

Reformation Endings: A Temporary Vanishing Act  201 studied life in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, “the story implies that the interior  spiritual disposition of the believer, more even than his external behavior, defined  the character of true holiness.” Thus, Our Lady’s Tumbler anticipates later pietist  movements within Christianity that focus on the efforts of lay people to achieve  individual sanctity by leading a consistent Christian life. So far, so good, except for  two provisos. The first is that we are accorded almost no insight into the tumbler’s  innermost thoughts and feelings; the second is that the validation of this ground rule  comes after a supremely un-Protestant miracle involving an image. For these reasons  and others, the story may have been superficially too Catholic for a Reformation era  but too latently Protestant, or at a minimum too popular in its underlying religious  presuppositions, for a Counter-Reformation. It ran the risk of serving neither the  reformers nor the counter-reformers. To round off the problems that the narrative  posed, both groups would have clucked their tongues over the salience within it of  such a questionable activity as dance.  Such inferences would clarify not only why this of all tales wilted away but also  why, in general, apparitions of the Virgin would have failed to win backing from the  Church in the centuries immediately following the Reformation. The showings that  have become entrenched in Catholicism came much later, such as those at Lourdes  in 1858, Fátima in 1917. By the same token, sites that had been suppressed were  revived during the same period: Walsingham has been rebuilt only since the Catholic  revival of the nineteenth century. To remain in Britain, it has been observed that in the  nineteenth century, just a few Catholic churches there possessed a Madonna before  Victoria became queen. Representations of Mary returned only under the influence  of the Gothic revival, spearheaded by the English architect and tastemaker Augustus  Welby Northmore Pugin (often confused or conflated with his similarly named  pro-Pugin-ators). One other point merits mention. Our Lady’s Tumbler is deeply preoccupied with  the nature of offering. In other words, the tale is concerned with the type of gift that  can win acceptance. It transmits at least two messages about giving. First, an offer is a  private matter between individual Christians and their God. Second, it has nothing to  do with physical property or financial instruments. The story makes sense for use by  churchmen to incentivize prayer, to encourage conversion to lay monasticism, and to  achieve various other ends. If, on the other hand, eliciting donations is a priority, this  exemplum is not necessarily the logical first choice. In the short run (although we are discussing a centuries-long stretch) Mary,  Madonnas, and exempla about apparitions of her were displaced or suppressed. No  facile invocation of the aphorism “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence” can  explain away the few hundred years that present neither a text nor even a citation,  reference, or allusion to fan hope that Our Lady’s Tumbler was known to anyone at  all. In literature, unpopularity in its most hard-baked form can lead to ostracism so  complete that the exclusion is tantamount to extinction. But a door remained open at  </page> <page sequence="32"> 202 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 1 least a crack for the prospective later return of Mary, Marian images, and masterpieces  about her apparitions and miracles. Gothic as an architectural style and tales from the  original Gothic era (not that they were yet “Gothic tales”) did not die out altogether  in the early sixteenth century. Rather, they hid in open view, awaiting archaeological  rediscovery and excavation. The story may have all but died. Then again, no text  preserved in manuscripts ever is eliminated entirely. Works of literature seldom  vanish into thin air.  In 1873, the tumbler was discovered in the cryogenic vat of a manuscript, a one- man iceblock but still capable of being brought back to life. Since that time the big  names on the medical team that took charge of his case have been, with surprising  frequency, unbelievers, Catholics lapsed into libertinism, Protestants without a solid  background in Marianism, and even Jews. Yet at the same time, many others who  helped to keep the tumbler in good trim and the juggler on his way were practicing  adherents of Roman Catholicism, who sometimes had the special zeal that comes  from recent conversion. Thus, the tumbler was revitalized in the late nineteenth  century and later benefited in equal measure from the faithful and the faithless. To  understand, we will need to observe microscopically those who raised him from the  dead (or unliving, to be more precise) and how they accomplished it. </page> </plain_text>
