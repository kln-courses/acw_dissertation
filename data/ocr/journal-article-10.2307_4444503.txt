<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CHIPMUNK S INSIDE-OUTSIDE WORLD, by Kay Cooper. 1973. Julian Messner, New York. 63 p. $4.79. Kay Cooper has, with few exceptions, avoided the trap of anthropomorphism, which plagues so many natural-history books for children. Yet, despite the absence of emotionalism and gimmicks, the narrative is rich in images and is highly entertaining. The story follows a male chipmunk from birth to maturity, describing vividly the animal's first days after birth, emergence from the burrow, feeding habits, burrow construction, natural enemies, hibernation, and- during the spring of a new year-mating and the birth of another generation of chipmunks. The organization is logical; the information, both factual and inter- esting. The style not only suits the read- ing abilities of most upper-elementary youngsters but also has the imagination, depth, and beauty that are characteris- tic of good writing for readers of all ages. Alvin Staffan's photographs en- hance the book's inherent charm. Faith Hickman Biological Sciences Curriculum Study Boulder, Colo.</page></plain_text>
