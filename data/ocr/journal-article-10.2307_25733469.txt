STETZ Darwin at Yale MARGARET HOMANS IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES: A VISIT TO DICKENS WORLD By Marty Gould and Rebecca Mitchell From Broadway's Oliver! to collectible miniature Dickens Village Christmas figurines, Charles Dickens's works have permeated our cultural imagination. Dickens World, a U.K. theme park, adds yet another reworking to the body of Dickens adaptations. Finding ourselves in London three weeks after the attraction's opening in May 2007, we took the opportunity to visit. A train whisked us from London's Victoria Station to Chatham, Dickens's boyhood home, and a short bus ride took us from the station to Dickens World (Figure 9). We entered Dickens World as believers, ready to commit fully to whatever suspensions of disbelief were required. And the opening was promising. A sign on the exterior of what looked to be a large-scale metal warehouse in the recently modernized Chatham dockyards promised eager visitors "THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES." Beyond the ultra-modern, blandly generic entrance hall and staircase, the air became dank, the walls became timber and plaster, and the light dimmed. A creaky suspension bridge led to an open town square hemmed by false fronts of houses and shops emblazoned with names drawn from Dickens's novels. This 287</page><page sequence="2">288 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE Figure 9. (Color online) "Dickens Parking Lot." Dickens World, Chatham, England.

Beneath the bridge we spied an endless parade of empty boats on the Great Expectations Boat Ride. Downstairs on the main street level, performers wandered about in Victorian costume: chimney sweepers in dirty rags, ladies in lace shawls, and urban bankers in top-hatted finery. A Cockney flower girl in a musty calico dress urged us to purchase an obviously fake rose, and a pale man in a black coat slithered silently by. Nearby, a small group of visiting schoolchildren played with a rustic hoop and a stick. Suddenly, a jaunty street urchin sidled up, stuck his hand into Rebecca's purse, and stealthily stole our Dickens World brochure. Apparently, in Dickens World's version of Victoriana, street crime is all part of the fun. Our next stop was The Haunted House of 1859, which despite its name was neither haunted nor a house. Nor did it bear any discernable relationship to 1859. Designated as "Scrooge's Haunted House" in the original promotional materials, it was renamed just prior to opening, perhaps to reflect the title of Dickens's 1859 short story, "The Haunted House." Joining a small group of visitors just inside the door, we followed a woman in a long, shroud-like dress down a series of narrow wainscoted corridors, adorned only with dirty floors and peeling paint. No chain-rattling ghosts or thick layers of cobwebs blocked the pseudo-Victorian passageway. No spooky portraits followed us with their eyes, and no eerie</page><page sequence="3">Victorians Live 289 music marked our journey. More perplexed than scared, our group of six arrived at our destination: a window cut into the blank wall. "Wait here." our guide said. "It'll start in a minute." And so we stood in front of the window and waited. Through the window we could see a low wooden bedstead. Next to the bed appeared a holographic Ebenezer Scrooge, bah-humbugging his way across the room. A Marley holograph next appeared, and explained to Scrooge that he would be visited by three other ghosts during the night. In this severely condensed retelling of the familiar story, the ghosts came and went, but Scrooge never left his own bedside, the action occurring entirely within his bedroom walls. The hallway was dotted with three other brief, holographic vignettes, each less scary than the next: Ralph Nickleby's suicide, a parade of miscellaneous characters from Dickens's novels, and an anthropomorphic chair from The Uncommercial Traveler. In the Haunted House, all the ghosts were safely contained behind walls and windows, and they took no notice of the visitors at all. Outside the Haunted House, a more immersive experience awaited. Judging from the Great Expectations Boat Ride's prominent position in the park's promotional materials, the owners of Dickens World seemed quite proud of this attraction, billed as the longest "dark boat ride" in Europe. With one of Dickens's best known and most engaging plots as its basis, the ride's possibilities seemed endless: scary encounters with Magwitch in the cemetery, an eerily spider-webbed Satis House with a massive rotting wedding cake, tense final moments with the convicts on the Thames - yet not one of these major scenes was represented. The Great Expectations Boat Ride is the only attraction at Dickens World that takes for its name the title of a novel. Despite this initial framing of the ride within a well-known story, the boat ride is most remarkable for its thorough lack of a narrative. Even in its conception, the ride muddles Great Expectations', story, as is evident in the description offered in a press release: As visitors board the boats they will have passed through the Newgate Prison area of the attraction and will have heard whispers about the escape of the convict Magwitch, from Dickens' Great Expectations novel. These whispers start the beginning of a story that visitors will follow as they journey around the attraction passing through the Tudor building in Quilps [sic] Creek, through a dark and smelly sewer pipe and across the rooftops of London. As the boats tumble down the 'Fall of Death' visitors will rejoin the story hearing how Magwitch is escaping across the Kent marshes as they pass through the foundry and cemetery areas of the boat ride, with Dickensian coppers in hot pursuit. (Dickens World 1) In Dickens World, Quilps Creek overflows the banks of The Old Curiosity Shop to wind up in Great Expectations, and Oliver Twisfs rooftop adventure intersects with Magwitch's escape down the river. Appropriate references to Pip's story are limited to Magwitch's voice calling to Pip, a mannequin of a young boy, and Magwitch's face in a window. In between are scenes that have little relationship to the plot of Great Expectations. Granted, a hard-and-fast plot is not necessary for a successful ride. Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean, a dark boat ride similar in concept, also lacks a narrative, but its series of scenes is brimming with activity, movement, and atmosphere. While Pirates of the Caribbean succeeds on the level of spectacle and the physical pleasure of the ride, the Great Expectations Boat Ride fails to deliver either spectacle or pleasure. We could forgive its failed fidelity to the plot of the novel for which it is named had the ride been otherwise enjoyable. The boat's movement through the ride is laboriously slow, however, and despite its title, the "Fall of Death" is one small flume which doesn't generate enough splash to warrant the ponchos sold</page><page sequence="4">290 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE in vending machines along the waiting line. A waterwheel also threatens to crush riders, but its pace is so slow as to be almost comical. After meandering through a cemetery - a scene which would have made more sense at the beginning of the ride instead of the end, per the novel - the boats make their way to a gallery of villains housed in what appear to be jail cells (Newgate Prison, perhaps?). Despite the commanding individuality and idiosyncratic markers that Dickens gave each of these villains, they are not here identifiable by appearance. The first figure, a poorly attired female mannequin with long, brown hair is identified as Madame Defarge by a voice-over narration, without which one might easily confuse her for any number of Dickens's female characters. Defarge stands opposite Daniel Quilp, identified by the voice-over as "an evil, dirty dwarf" and next to Bill Sikes, murderer. The criminal lineup ends with Uriah Heep, whom we are told is "ever so 'umble, but a real nasty piece of work." Since all are wearing similar suits and top hats, there is little to distinguish one man from another. As the boats lurched into their docking place and we exited the ride, our expectations, like Pip's, were effectively dashed. We were now primed for a more formal education in Dotheboy's Schoolhouse. In this single room, Dickens World managed to create an experience that echoed the Victorian - if only by exaggerating our stereotyped vision of the Victorian educational experience as cold and unforgiving - while being fun. The sparse, one-room schoolhouse was grim, as rusty, exposed pipes lined the ceiling and oppressively dark wainscoting skirted antiqued walls adorned only with words of wisdom stenciled in large letters: "Speak When Spoken To." It was quaint in its austerity, and hosted the most successful of the Dickensish actors, playing a sadistic schoolmaster who took glee in embarrassing the "students." Dressed head-to-toe in black, he hurled vituperation at the unwitting guests as they wandered in and out of the classroom. Upon entering, for example, we were admonished for being late. The more the schoolmaster berated the guests, the more we seemed to enjoy it. His interaction was spontaneous and funny, and reflected a basic self-awareness that was absent from most of the other attractions: only in a theme park would you willingly adopt the masochistic behavior required to enter a schoolroom to be humiliated and to take a test. An exam and a draconian taskmaster seem apropos since, one may imagine, most non-academics encounter Dickens as part of a school-mandated reading list. Dotheboy's Schoolhouse recreated a modern day idea of a Victorian experience, hyperbolizing those elements that we fetishize - disciplinary authorities, uncomfortable furniture, rote learning - in light of the more generous educational models operating today. Touch-sensitive video screens lined rows of hard wooden desks, cleverly updating the slates of old with modern technology. In a Chutes-and-Ladders style game, guests-as-students were quizzed on their knowledge of Dickens trivia, much of it biographical (for example, "In what kind of factory did Dickens work as a child?"). Dickens World surely was not produced with the fastidious academic in mind, but it seems at least one designer realized that a number of those interested in visiting Dickens World would be readers, teachers, or scholars. At the end of the quiz game in the Dotheboy's School our scores were reported with more humor-tinged harshness, high achievers earning the following praise: "Well Done! You have worked hard at school. There may be a teaching career for you here, but it won't pay very well" (Figure 10). True indeed! Up the stairs and across from the school, we found Peggoty's Boathouse tucked away in a dark corner. Once again, the attraction's title was more confusing than enlightening or</page><page sequence="5">Victorians Live 291 Figure 10. (Color online) "Trivial Premonitions." Dickens World, Chatham, England. Personal photograph by Rebecca Mitchell. 18 June 2007. textually accurate. Instead of Yarmouth Flats or the image of Little Em'ly by the fire, there was a 3-D animated film of Dickens's life. The film managed to balance entertainment with information in a fairly effective way. And the 3-D effects added to the amusement, allowing the spectators to be showered, for example, by the pages of Dickens's manuscripts. The film interwove details from Dickens's domestic life - his marriage, family, and adulterous relationship with Ellen Ternan - with his career, with a surprising focus on Dickens's trips to America. We heard a lot about Martin Chuzzlewit and American Notes as the narrator described the rise and fall of Dickens's star in the United States. Although Dickens World promised to reconnect its visitors with Victorian England, the film's topical focus suggested that it was designed with an audience of American tourists in mind. The film's suitability for children was reinforced by its use of animation, as well as its proximity to Fagin's Den, a McDonald's-style playground with little connection to anything Victorian at all. In this modern, plastic play area, the only structure in the park specifically intended for children, no effort was made to approximate an authentic Victorian experience. Furthermore, the attraction's wildly inappropriate title, Fagin's Den, conjures up images of depravity and criminality, hardly suggestive of a wholesome family experience. Dickens</page><page sequence="6">292 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE World deploys the brightly colored padded structures of the modern indoor ball-pit to sanitize the seedier side of Dickens and render it appropriate for a family audience. If certain attractions catered to specific audiences, the gift shop sought to satisfy universal consumerist desires. Dickens's oeuvre provided the proprietors of Dickens World the perfect title for a souvenir shop, and it seems they could not resist, as the souvenir stand is called The Olde Curiosity Shoppe (with extra e's added to make it seem more authentically Victorian, if less true to Dickens's original). Yet it appears they actively refuse to exploit any of the elements of that term: the store is neither old nor filled with curiosities. To reach the store one must leave the dark, dank interior of the theme park and walk down a staircase into a modern, brightly lit retail space. From here one can gaze - through the wall of windows - across the parking lot to an outlet mall and Cineplex. For many of us raised in the post-Disney-Land society, vulgar profiteering rarely gets in the way of a good time, at theme parks anyway; the prospect of the gift shoppe at Dickens World was especially tantalizing: T-shirts emblazoned with the pock-marked face of Esther Summerson, Madame Defarge dolls complete with knitting needles and guillotine necklace, a Marley door-knocker. Alas, Dickens World didn't offer such wares. What it did offer was a line of theme park memorabilia (oversized novelty pencils, ball caps, and brightly colored T-shirts), a selection of English heritage items (teas, bath salts, and so forth), and a complete collection of Dickens's novels. Where Dickens is not the literal author of the item, his signature is used to validate the theme park-branded goods. On most of these items the sole graphic representation of the park is the phrase "Dickens World" printed in a font which mimics Dickens's handwriting. "Dickens" alone is enough to confer authenticity on the merchandise: Dickens is the brand. And when Dickens is not the brand, England is. Though the gift shop set out to satisfy the consumerist desires of all Dickens World visitors, it's not at all clear what sort of audience the theme park as a whole imagines for itself. Is it marketing itself to the Dickens enthusiast who has read most (if not all) the novels and has an insatiable hunger for all things Dickens? With an eye to the finicky demands of Dickens enthusiasts, Dickens World's designers consulted with Thelma Grove, former secretary of the Dickens Fellowship, who "insisted at every stage on absolute authenticity" (Addley). Given this effort, the number of slippages between signifier and signified is puzzling: Peggoty's Boathouse doesn't have anything to do with David Copperfield, and Pip is largely missing from the Great Expectations Boat Ride. Readily recognizable titles, character names, and icons are invoked to render the attractions "Dickensian" despite the fact that few, if any, are textually accurate. Dickens World enacts Dickens as a shorthand for modern popular notions of "the Victorian," vividly demonstrating the extent to which Dickens has become a contemporary brand, his name authorizing any and all iterations of Victorian figures, experiences, and products. Though the park will attract some hard-core Dickens enthusiasts, it is safe to assume most visitors to Dickens World have not read the majority of Dickens's novels and so will not be locking for a precise enactment of the texts, but will expect instead an experience that confirms a set of more diffuse cultural assumptions about Victoriana.
