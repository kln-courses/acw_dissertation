<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER FLURY. Liebe und Liebessprache bei Menander, Plautus und Terenz. ("Bibliothek der klassischen Altertumswissenschaften," Neue Folge, 2. Reihe, Band 25.) Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitiits- verlag, 1968. Pp. 104. DM 18 (paper); DM 22 (cloth). The title of this revised dissertation is misleading since it discusses neither love nor sermo amatorius. A more accurate title would be Die Rolle der Liebenden und ihre Empfindungen in der griechisch-romischen Kom6die, since Flury's aims are twofold: (1) to show how the characters in Menander, Plautus and Terence speak of their love, and (2) to show in what ways they express their feelings and communicate them to the spectator or reader. His conclusions, briefly stated, are as follows. Part I: To Menander's lover and his slave "love" is a powerful god. The lover has no control over himself and his actions. In Terence Amor is not personified. It is an impulse, a feeling without divine influence, often coupled with other feelings. Plautus personifies Love - not as a god, but as a being with anthropomorphic traits. Part II: In Menander the lover can view his love impersonally and ironically. He seldom reveals his feelings directly and spontaneously except when the treatment is lightly ironical. Terence's lovers reveal an intensity and directness in the expression of their feelings that Menander's lack. For them love is an expression of menschlicher animus. Plautus' lovers present their feelings dramatically with abundance of details and often through the use of pictures and metaphorical language. Plautus sacrifices verisi- militude for the sake of caricature and witty word- play. Part III gives a few characteristic examples of metaphorical language in the aforementioned authors. Despite an interesting thesis and the fact that there is undoubtedly some truth in F.'s findings, this dis- sertation is basically disappointing in both method and result. The best that one can say is that it will soon become another bibliographical reference among the Ueberfluss of studies dealing with Greco-Roman comedy. GEORGE F.
