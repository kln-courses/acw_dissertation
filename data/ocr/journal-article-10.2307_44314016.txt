<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 58, No. 2 (Winter 2009) The American "Lives" of Jesus: The Malleable Figure of Christ as a Man of the People Lisa Moody The religious culture of late nineteenth-century America involves a curious combination of theological debate and popular social reform rhetoric. A battle for cultural authority emerges in print culture between church leaders and social reform writers, particularly domestic novelists. This discourse is exhibited in the proliferation of religious biographies, which were profoundly influenced in American popular culture by Congregationalist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, who published The Life of Jesus, the Christ in 1871. This genre was quickly appropriated by popular novelists, and read in tandem, these biographies allow us to view a discourse that represents a shifting of power in the mediation of social reform rhetoric that ultimately materializes in the social gospel movement, a reform platform that marries Christian ethics with modern cultural concerns that are largely related to the Industrial Age. While American Protestantism in the nineteenth century, particularly in the Northeast, seemed to be moving away from its Calvinist roots and arguably toward an ecumenical Christianity, or at a least nondenominational Protestantism, Calvinist clergy nevertheless played a key role in the negotiation of both religious and social liberal reform. Because of increased access to the written word, the impact of such reform efforts affected national audiences with far- reaching results. Popular preachers coming out of various Calvinist creeds, such as Presbyterian Thomas De Witt Talmage and Congregationalists Henry Ward Beecher and Charles Sheldon, relied on the printed word to reach audiences of thousands although each was equally skilled in oratory, drawing in huge crowds to their affiliated churches. These three prominent figures, along with several other popular literary figures, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, and Mary Austin, experimented with a variety of literary forms including sermons, religious tracts, fiction, and even religious biography in their reconsideration of biblical authority in relation to contemporary moral ethics. 157</page><page sequence="2">158 Lisa Moody It is in the religious biographies especially, which are known as the lives- of-Jesus biographies, that one finds an interesting rhetorical intersection of hermeneutics, theology, and sociology. Beecher's work is central to an examination of this genre because he bridges the gap between church leaders and social reform writers as he strives to find a literary form that allows him to construct a highly personalized theology that seeks to reach a public well beyond the confines of the traditional church congregation. Beecher's preference for interpretive hermeneutics shows his awareness of earlier biblical criticism undercutting scriptural authority, and we must view his work as an expression of his desire to show the ongoing relevance of the Bible to the modern age rather than a dismissal of scriptural authority. Richard Fox writes, "In the late nineteenth century, liberal Protestantism was the established religion of a nation without an officially established religion. Beecher's force derived from his command of a religious tradition that was rapidly secularizing thanks in no small part to his own work" ( Trials of Intimacy 21). These lives-of- Jesus biographies reveal the struggle to contribute to a liberal Protestantism that in turn responds to the declining Calvinist ethos in American culture. A close examination of some of these texts will show that this particular form of religious tract was appropriated in an attempt to achieve something more comprehensive than merely religious reform or biblical criticism; indeed, these biographies extended the role of the church well beyond the level of individual spiritual salvation. They came to represent a key philosophical turning point in the integration of religious and social reform ideology, one that moves away from eschatological concerns to a stronger material consideration of how to establish God's Kingdom here on earth.1 The lives-of-Jesus biographies emerge as a form of discourse, with each responding in a certain manner to those preceding it. By the late nineteenth century each work must also be considered as a rewriting of theology and social ethics, as each writer builds on the ethical implications of what it means to question the literal authority of biblical text. Patrick Allitt points out the utility that Christian biography offers to the reformer: "It is a powerful advantage in a predominantly Christian nation to believe that Jesus approves of one's way of life. By identifying oneself with Jesus, one stands a good chance of seizing the American moral high ground" (128). These biographies offer many variations of Jesus in American culture alternately imagined as a divine visionary, a figure of human perfection, a historical sage or prophet, and even as a holy spirit who operates from within</page><page sequence="3">The American "Lives" of Jesus 159 rather than from above. The biographies also reflect the increasing cultural importance placed on the figure of Jesus, a significant move away from the Calvinist emphasis on the sovereignty of the Father rather than the Son (Fox, Jesus in America 184). One might argue that the process of reconfiguring Jesus began with Thomas Jefferson when he wrote "The Life and Morals of Jesus" in 1820, a virtual splicing of the New Testament gospels designed to separate the historical figure of Jesus from his supernatural affiliation with or as God. But if Jefferson set the stage for the freedom to intuit the figure of Jesus using Common Sense reasoning, the American biographers of Jesus continued beyond biblical or even historical interpretation as each reconstructed not only the character of Jesus, liberated from the gospels and various church creeds, but the application of this figure to the social problems of the modern world.2 While Beecher represents a significant "passing of the baton" from clergyman to novelist in American religious discourse, the advent of the lives-of-Jesus biographies did not originate in the United States. Rather, this convention was adopted by several writers in the nineteenth century, following the publication of two influential biographies of Jesus published in Europe. In fact, such accounts were popular reading in several countries during this time: Germany, France, England, and America. Each biography bears the unique stamp of its author, subtly shaping the genre in new and unique ways with each addition. In order to place these biographies into a clearer perspective relative to late nineteenth-century religious culture, it is first necessary to understand the context of their origins as a convention of biblical criticism and then to trace the ways in which late nineteenth- century American writers appropriated this literary form in order to negotiate religious and social change. One of the earliest lives-of-Jesus accounts is David Strausss Das Leban Jesu from 1835, a work that subsequently became emblematic of German high criticism. This work did not initially attract a great deal of attention until George Eliot completed a translation in 1846 (Pals 26). Once the work appeared in English, it produced a tremendous stir, although mainly in theological circles as the general population may not have fully understood some of the implications of Strausss unorthodox approach.3 Strauss examined the life of Jesus in terms of myth, and he rejected traditional "proofs" of Christs divinity such as the gospel accounts of the miracles.4 Another significant aspect of Strausss biographical account was his preference for the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) and</page><page sequence="4">160 Lisa Moody his disregard for the Gospel of John, "a view that has largely prevailed to the present time" (Kissinger 23). James Turner describes the underlying controversy of Strausss Das Leban Jesu : "Strauss did not simply deny the literal accuracy of the New Testament; he came close to denying that Jesus had ever lived ... [and he argued that the Gospels] created a myth of a God- man" (147). Studies in comparative religion in the nineteenth century have similarly contributed to the questioning of the divinity of Jesus, pointing to similar manifestations of God in man in other religious traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. The biographical form allowed Strauss and subsequent writers to historicize Jesus by removing elements associated with myth, miracles, or supernaturalism. By doing so, these biographers can tout either the divine or the secular authority of Jesus or both, depending on their audience, since Christian theology embracing a divine Jesus doesn't preclude viewing him simultaneously as a secular figure. Highly influenced by Strauss, Ernest Renan wrote his own biography, bringing the German high criticism not only to a predominantly French Catholic readership but to international audiences as well. In fact, Renans 1863 La Vie de JÃ©su proved to be more accessible and more widely imitated than Strausss earlier biography. Renan made at least one important theological shift in his source documents that allows his text to be read responsively, and thus he began the discourse that would be taken up by future biographers of Jesus, each written with an eye to the biographies preceding it. Renans approach was slightly different than Strausss in that he preferred the Gospel of John to the synoptic gospels (Kissinger 25) but, like Strauss, he believed that the miracles (the main evidence of Christs divinity) were spurious (Pals 33). From a theological perspective, Renans work was fairly shocking; he presented Jesus as a historical figure, one who might be the son of God, but who was not necessarily equated with God. He writes: "Jesus never once gave utterance to the sacrilegious idea that he was God" (61). He presents a Jesus who became increasingly fanatic as he "yielded to the ideas that were current in his own time" (161). By presenting Jesus as a figure of moral idealism rather than a divine incarnation, Renan sets up a form of rhetoric that views Jesus as an image of perfectionism but simultaneously insists on his humanity. He also included what has come to be known as the "fifth gospel" (Pals 38), which is a first-hand account of Renans visit to the historical locations written about in the gospels, thus combining a kind of travel writing with biography in an attempt to instill eyewitness authenticity to the genre. His work gained attention in both</page><page sequence="5">The American "Lives" of Jesus 161 theological circles and popular society. Daniel Pals writes: "Its sentimental charm and imaginative effects captivated the reading public, if not the scholarly community, of Europe" (32). The popularity of Renan's biography opened up the literary space for the lives-of-Jesus biographies, both in England with Frederic William Farrar's The Life of Christ (1874) and in America with Beecher, Stowe, Phelps, and Austin among others.5 Religious biography, combining biblical scholarship and sociology, is a curious form of pious writing because it purports to tout scriptural authority, generally professing a reliance on the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, while at the same time offering a rewritten scripture, presumably combining the gospels into one continuous narrative line. What emerges, however, is a negotiation of social ethics citing the authority of Jesus's teachings, but one which ironically undercuts the very credibility of the gospels as "true" accounts of the life of Jesus by offering a modern replacement. Richard Fox writes: "The malleable figure of Jesus helped American Protestants of all stripes move into the modern era together" (JiA 156). One is tempted to try and locate a common reform strategy across these works, exhortations against industrial capitalism, for example, or temperance treatises, but a close examination of several of the Gilded Age lives-of-Jesus biographies reveals how much this type of life- writing really reflects the life of the author's individual reform ideology rather than that of either the scriptural Jesus or the nineteenth century at large. Beecher, for example, deals mainly with temperance reform, while Stowe focuses on emerging feminist concerns. What these biographies share is a common language, a type of stock justification for rewriting an image of Jesus in a manner that will be relevant to the modern age, and we will see below how it is Beecher who provides that formula. Each writer appropriates the authority of Jesus to sanction his or her individually derived moral concerns allowing these new ethics to be labeled as Christian principles. Ferenc Szasz describes such an approach as introducing Americans to historicism, which is "the idea that events can be understood by knowing the circumstances that surrounded their origin" (34). By historicizing scriptural references and moral lessons to the specific culture surrounding the historical life of Jesus, these biographers were then able to extract the "essence" of Jesus and appropriate biblical authority to endorse the moral lessons each deemed suitable for modern life. In a way, these biographies came to serve as tangible expressions of each author's claim to have a personal relationship with Jesus, a precept still frequently heard in churches today. This is a decided move</page><page sequence="6">162 Lisa Moody away from the notion of sola scriptum, in which the scriptures alone serve as the way to know God. Intuiting Jesus becomes a way to interpret scripture and to apply scriptural ethics to contemporary culture by historicizing the lessons of the Bible.6 An important consideration of the dominant religious climate of the late nineteenth century was that no one could safely assume to understand what a particular creed stood for or represented, and thus it is difficult to read these biographies as representative of a specific creeds attempt to renegotiate its theology. There was no clear delineation of the boundaries between Presbyterianism and Congregationalism by the late nineteenth century, if there ever was on American soil. Hatch writes: "The flexibility and innovation of religious organizations made it possible for an American to find an amenable group no matter what his or her preference in belief, practice, or institutional structure" (65). Henry Ward Beecher, in fact, began as a Presbyterian minister when he was ordained in 1838 (Applegate 156), switched over to Congregationalism in 1847 upon his relocation to the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn (Applegate 210), and finally renounced even his Congregationalism in 1882 (462) although he remained as the minister of Plymouth Church until his 1888 death. Because of his changing allegiances, it would be faulty to assume that he was speaking on behalf of or even to a specific denomination of the institutional church. Beecher, like all of these biographers, was continually rewriting his own personal theology, letting go of concepts and doctrine to which he could not subscribe.7 Beecher's The Life of Jesus, the Christ (1871) clearly responds to the earlier work of Strauss and Renan, but he purposefully avoids controversial topics such as the demythologization of the historical Jesus or the relative value of the gospels. It is this antidogmatic approach that suggests Beecher's aim is not, in fact, biblical criticism but rather a more general concern with how to derive the fundamental Christian ethics that he believes can be located in Christ's philosophy rather than in specific historical circumstances or actions. In his introduction, he makes it clear that he is establishing all four gospels as equally authentic sources of historical authority (iii). In fact, Beecher states his intent to offer a cohesive account: "The object of this compilation has been to consolidate the matter of the four Gospels so as to form it into one continuous narrative" (329). Further, he is direct about his aim to challenge Renan's depiction of Christ as a fanatic caught up in the ambitious web of his followers:</page><page sequence="7">The American "Lives" of Jesus 163 Renan, to save the character of his poetic hero, is obliged to depict him as the subject of an enthusiasm which grew upon him until it became a self-deceiving fanaticism. It seems, then, that the whole world has been under the influence of one who was not an impostor, only because he was mildly insane. (10) From a doctrinal and theological standpoint, Beecher s work appears to be fairly conservative and mediating. He purports to bow to the authority of the four Gospels, rejects Renans humanizing depiction, and refuses to address any inconsistencies in doctrinal evidence. Beecher frequently mentions these historical problems, such as the confusion over the location of Jesuss birth, but he merely identifies challenges to Christs authority without any attempt to resolve them.8 What aligns Beechers work with liberal Protestantism is his open acknowledgement that the Gospels need to be interpreted rather than read literally. Such a stance is merely a rhetorical pose; in American culture liberal sects have tended to take up this pose while more conservative sects claim to rely on literal interpretations of scripture. In fact, in Christ &amp; Culture , H. Richard Niebuhr offers a fivefold descriptive typology for discussing Jesus in relation to culture. He believes that liberal Protestants, whom he calls "cultural Protestants" (109), present Christ as being "of culture' (109), meaning that there is a universal meaning in the Gospels that can be applied to civic life in any age (105). Niebuhr writes: " [They] find it strangely desirable to write apocryphal gospels and new lives of Jesus. They take some fragment of the complex New Testament ... call this the one essential characteristic of Jesus, elaborate it, and ... [it] is always something that seems to agree with the interests and needs of their time" (109). 9 Beecher illustrates Niebuhr s typology very well when he states his belief that early Christians needed the Gospels, and specifically that they needed the miracles, for testimony, but that modern Christians benefit from understanding the value of the Gospels to a certain historic period: "The very reason which would lead us to suspect a miracle in our day gave it credibility in other days. It is simply a question of adaptation" (Beecher 14). 10 One can see his deft sidestepping here; he does not specify whether he believes the actions of Jesus to be divine (that is, that Jesus performed miracles because, at the time, miracles were needed) or simply that only the written testimony needed to suggest divinity as tangible proof for the primitive mind. Ultimately, Beecher simply concludes that the life of Christ and his teachings need to be interpreted and applied to the modern world in order to account for the progress of the</page><page sequence="8">164 Lisa Moody centuries intervening between the historical life of Jesus and the nineteenth century (Allitt 132). In fact, what Beecher does is to rewrite those moral lessons he locates in the Bible that are contrary to what he considers to be appropriate ethical guidelines for nineteenth-century society. While his work appears to conform to a fairly traditional interpretation of scripture, placing heavy weight on the reliability of gospel history, Beecher, in fact, avoids controversy about scriptural interpretation altogether by claiming that such literature belonged to a different age and was geared to a more primitive intellect. He writes: "The early ages needed testimony; our age needs teaching. Four witnesses are better for testimony. But for biography one complete narrative, combining in it the materials of the four, would have given a picture of our Lord more in accordance with the habits and wants of men in our day" (2). Beecher's claim implies that even writing genres correspond to different ages of civilization. An important aspect of Beecher's theology was his belief that humanity had evolved socially and that modern society was superior to the social world and culture of Jesus's historical life. He writes: "The knowledge of the human heart, of its yearnings, its failures, its sins and sorrows, has immensely increased in the progress of centuries" (5). Beecher was strongly influenced by his reading of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species (1859) and, like Herbert Spencer, he interpreted Darwin's evolutionary theory to mean something more than adaptation but rather a move toward perfectionism.11 * Beecher found in Darwin's theory the exact logic required in order to combine Christian moral ethics with concerns about the evils he saw in the modern age. Specifically, he was concerned with the dangers of alcohol, and he wished to align temperance with Christian values. A literal reading of the Bible is problematic because of the Gospel account of Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding of Cana. If Jesus endorsed the consumption of alcohol, how could Beecher advance his temperance agenda? Beecher deduces certain aspects of the "spirit" of Jesus, shows him to be a lawgiver in the period in which he lived, and then abstracts what he needs in order to postulate about the kinds of laws Jesus would bring to a more advanced civilization, nearly two thousand years later. He writes: "Had Jesus, living in our time, beheld the wide waste and wretchedness arising from inordinate appetites, can anyone doubt on which side he would be found?" ( 144). Allitt locates a new element of interpretation in Beecher's work, one which was widely imitated in the lives of Jesus that subsequently appeared in American culture:</page><page sequence="9">The American "Lives" of Jesus 165 Beecher established one of the techniques that have persisted in the Jesus literature ever since. If Jesus did something of which the author approves, he is cited as an authority for doing likewise. But if Jesus did the opposite of what the author requires, an argument about changed social context can always explain away the difficulty: Jesus would have acted this way had he been alive now. (134) In short, Beecher created the method for appropriating " 'essential" aspects of Christian authority and provided a model for citing that authority as an endorsement of ones reform initiatives. Beecher was not alone in his concern over drunkenness, by any means. Although Beechers Life of Jesus is the only one that deals specifically with the dangers of alcohol, temperance was a major social issue in the nineteenth century. In The Dangerous Classes of New York , Charles Loring Brace discusses several reform possibilities to control "the Sunday orgies [of drinking] and crimes" (72). Brace discusses the temperance laws forbidding the sale of alcohol on Sundays, which were established "to keep one day free from riotous or public drinking" (70). He also discusses the possibility of producing "light wines" (69), which might satisfy the passion for alcohol without danger of public misrule. In America, uncontrolled drinking was considered to be directly related to the influx of immigrants of "certain nationalities" (Brace 71) and was an "especial temptation to the working- classes" (70). 12 What Beecher accomplished was to apply the ethics of Christian morality to social reform in order to address concerns unique to the modern era, problems for which answers could not be found directly in the Bible. He negotiated a compromise between religion and "the disciplining of the crowd" (Fox, "The Culture of Liberal Protestant Progressivism" 660) that paved the way for social gospel reform philosophy.13 While considering how these religious biographers conducted their discourse about various ways to apply scripture to contemporary ethics, it is important also to remember that, during this era, the textual authority of the Bible was severely challenged. In particular, many denominations protested when the King James Bible was revised in 1881 (Szasz 19-21). Szasz writes: "Higher criticism received its first sustained publicity with the furor surrounding the revision of the Bible in the early 1880s" (19). Even small changes to what was once a standard edition, often handed down within the family, is a problematic notion to a culture whose founding Puritans were dedicated to the literal interpretation of scripture.14 To make any change was to acknowledge that the Bible could be edited at will, raising</page><page sequence="10">166 Lisa Moody a question about the reliability of source documents. Szasz writes: "Because no one possessed the original documents, the question was raised of the accuracy of the over 2,600 Hebrew manuscripts containing parts of the Old Testament and the over 3,000 manuscripts containing parts of the New Greek Testament" (20). Updated translations between 1881 and 1905, which changed the wording of certain biblical passages, caused further dissension among Protestant sects as to the legitimacy of both the new translations and the formerly accepted ones. The controversy was not so much a matter of dispute over specific wording but rather a problem with the possibility that there was no single sacred authoritative text, an assumption that most of the descendents of the Puritans had apparently taken for granted.15 The origins of skepticism regarding Biblical authority predate the 1881 revisions, as these religious biographies reveal, but this event did serve as a sharp dividing point between later fundamentalists and liberal Protestant sects who had to reconcile theology with a changing approach to biblical interpretation because of the variety of editions that had become available with changes to the prose itself. At this point, the edition selected by each sect or even denomination became invested with its own kind of sacred authority. Following upon the heels of Beecher's Life of Jesus, his sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe published her own biographical account of Jesus, titled Footsteps of the Master in 1877. Stowe's account is a curious combination of scriptural history and a compilation of her favorite religious doctrines, arranged by topic, in a manner suggestive of a commonplace book. She includes poems, essays, hymns, and famous sayings by a wide variety of sources, including Tennyson, Cowper, Holmes, and Wesley. Her history is divided into five major sections, focusing mainly on the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus, omitting the controversial miracles altogether. John Gatta suggests that the liturgical structure of this work emphasizes Stowe's growing reverence for and conversion to the Episcopal Church (422). He also suggests that Stowe's "mounting resistance to Calvinist Christianity can be traced through novels such as The Minister's Wooing (1859) and Agnes of Sorrento ( 1 862)" (412) and argues that Stowe's biography is both a theological declaration as well a hermeneutical one. In Stowe's religious aesthetic, Gatta locates a decided emphasis on material experience and sacramental practices as outward signs of devotion, which he finds in Stowe's admiration for festive traditions and "primitive customs" (421). In short, Gatta makes the argument that Stowe attempts to unify scriptural history with modern culture through performance of sacramental and devotional behavior. He</page><page sequence="11">The American "Lives" of Jesus 167 suggests that viewing the figure of Mary as an allegory for unconditional love allows Stowe to create a similar material allegory in contemporary culture by drawing on the domestic female figure. Similarly, Eileen Elrod suggests that Stowe's hermeneutics include specific feminist "revisionary strategies" (709) for dealing with scriptural history. She also points out Stowe's willingness to look to sources other than scripture, not only modern religious writings but also "extra-biblical legends" (708) re-tracing the tales of undervalued Old Testament and New Testament women, such as Miriam and the Virgin Mary (71 1).16 Both Gatta and Elrod offer significant evidence of Stowe's shifting theology in her fiction and her nonfiction, and we must examine some of Stowe's specific strategies in Footsteps of the Master in order to see how her theology reflects the corresponding social and cultural concerns of late nineteenth-century America. Stowe contributes two major interpretations to liberal Protestantism; she seeks to reconcile Old Testament and New Testament teachings, and she feminizes Jesus by arguing that his lineage from the House of David is meant to be traced maternally rather than paternally. By doing so, Stowe seeks to elevate the importance of a domestic model of social ethics, reflecting an early feminist argument that women are central to the development of moral behavior. What Stowe suggests is that if Genesis begins a relationship subordinating woman to man, then the Gospels complete the analogy by reversing the relationship, showing Jesus to be the offspring of Mary. Elrod explains Stowe's reasoning in making this link; "While the creation account emphasizes Adam's primacy ... in her account of the incarnation, Stowe emphasizes Jesus' likeness to Mary" (715). Although she is labeled a sentimentalist by modern literary critic Thomas Jenkins, a label also attached to Renan, Stowe created a product that attempted to embody both a theological reform platform as well as a social one, a pragmatic model that could be enacted in modern life. Jenkins writes: "These gospel-based biographies of Christ served as a kind of accessible, sentimental biblical criticism" (63). What Jenkins hones in on is the reliance on "feeling" that emerges during this era, a shift that combines modern moral ethics with intuitive religious authority. As with the other American lives of Jesus, Stowe's theology provides the logical framework needed to advance her social reform ideology promoting the role of women as agents of moral authority. Stowe's emphasis on Old Testament references to Jehovah provide the basis for her reading of Jesus as having fulfilled all the conditions needed</page><page sequence="12">168 Lisa Moody for one to accept Jesus as the Messiah. In addition, she structures a kind of compromise for liberal Protestantism as older Calvinist interpretations of the angry God of the Old Testament are shed: Stowe declared that all appearances of Jehovah in the Old Testament were really "preappearances" of Christ. This was a remarkable strategy. It allowed her to assimilate her incarnationalism with Old Testament anthropomorphism, creating a mixture of extraordinary dramatic power. This was a power that most incarnationalists, like theists, denied themselves by distancing their characterizations of God from the Old Testament. (Jenkins 72) Stowe herself did not claim to be the first to argue that the coming of Christ was foretold in the Old Testament. In fact she writes: "It has been the approved sentiment of sound theologians that in the Old Testament every visible appearance of an Angel or a divine Man to whom the name Jehovah is given is a pre-appearance of the redeemer, Christ" (23). 17 In addition, Stowe s assertion that Mary is the source of lineage from the Old Testament David to the New Testament Messiah might also be read as a negotiation of a modernized form of Christianity. She writes: "The view adopted in the Roman Church with respect to this one Woman of women have tended to deprive the rest of the world of a great source of comfort and edification by reason of the opposite extreme to which Protestant reaction has naturally gone" (64). By shifting divine authority to a matriarchal model, Stowe elevates the importance of the female figure in the modern world. She wants to renegotiate Christianity by showing Jesus to be a blended specimen of both male and female perfection with both aspects weighing equally in his role as redeemer. Both Beecher and Stowe emphasize the importance of Old Testament scripture to modern Christianity. There are two advantages to making a connection between Old Testament and New Testament teachings. The first is that by arguing the Old Testament contains prophesies foretelling the coming of the Messiah, the New Testament can then be admitted as testimony that Jesus fulfilled the conditions laid out in the Old Testament. This is simply an extension of an evidentiary argument begun in the gospels. The second advantage is that by reiterating the Jewish heritage of Jesus, his role as lawgiver becomes a prominent aspect of his moral authority. Both Stowe and Beecher focus on the importance of Jesus as lawgiver in order to structure an argument that Jesus, were he alive in the</page><page sequence="13">The American "Lives" of Jesus 169 modern age, would continue to provide guidance for the ills of society. For Beecher, this guidance meant temperance. For Stowe, Jesuss Old Testament lineage through Mary provides for a reading of Jesus as a God at home in the domestic sphere. She writes: "Many little incidents in Christ's life show the man of careful domestic habits. He was in all things methodical and frugal. ... His illustrations show the habits of a frugal home" (Stowe 68). In contemporary twenty-first-century culture, it is difficult to read Stowe's domestic Christianity as feminist, but it should be clear in the context of the nineteenth century that Stowe's emphasis on Jesuss female inheritance was an attempt to assert the domestic female figure as a legitimate source of moral and cultural authority. In evaluating these works of Christian literature, it is important to remember that they were aimed primarily at a popular audience with the purpose of influencing specific cultural practices. The literary space for our genre was created by the work of earlier writers such as Strauss and Renan, and these late nineteenth-century reformers were quick to seize on it to shape both religious and social reform. Writers such as Beecher and Stowe as well as Phelps and Austin had already experimented with a variety of genres and styles as a means of negotiating liberal reforms; Beecher wrote sermons and even one work of fiction, Norwood (1868), while Stowe wrote her most famous social reform work, Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), as well as regional fiction, including The Minister's Wooing (1859) and The Pearl at Orr's Island (1862). As Shirley Case points out: "[E]very shade of modern activity which has behind it the inspiration of a religious impulse depicts Jesus in accordance with its own immediate interests and ideals. He is made the authoritative teacher for a modern social order" (566). What Case suggests is that the appropriation of biblical authority in the mode of religious biography marks a shift of power from a church-based mediation of sacred texts to a popular rhetorical model. This appropriation was available not only to the clergy but to any writer who chose to utilize this convention. The public did not differentiate because the genre's religious affiliation carried with it a certain amount of inherent authority that guaranteed an audience. The importance of religious biography as a negotiation of religious and social reform continued to thrive long after Beecher and Stowe embraced this genre. Phelps, who Elbert described as "one of the most prolific writers of the nineteenth century" (438), was known primarily as a writer of fiction, yet she adopted the biographical form enabling her to disseminate</page><page sequence="14">170 Lisa Moody her reform rhetoric in an array of literary formats.18 When Phelps wrote her late-century The Story of Jesus, the Christ: An Interpretation (1897), she similarly drew on the familiar premise that her work should present a single line of narrative, offering a teaching and consolidation of the four Gospels. Phelps, however, signals her social reform goal with a reference to Jesus as "the greatest force in civilization" (ix). Like Beecher and Stowe, she had already established a huge following. Her earlier revisionist fictional "tract," The Gates Ajar (1868), offered a reformist alternative to Calvinist theology by locating a form of spiritual materialism in death, based on the creed of the reincarnationalist (O'Connor 156).19 She wrote this work in a mode of visionary fiction, and it was so popular that she wrote three sequels, Beyond the Gates (1883), The Gates Between (1887), and Within the Gates (1901). David Reynolds writes, "In her three post- 1880 visionary novels, hell is reduced to separation from loved ones and salvation to a reunion with them, usually after a genial talk with The Master" (202). Phelps conjured up a domestic, comforting image of the afterlife that provided more solace in the Gilded Age than the Calvinist vision of facing a wrathful and judgmental God. The Gates Ajar offers the most comprehensive view of Phelps's theology, and a brief overview will help explain Phelps's approach to the religious subject in The Story of Jesus. Her view of heaven is an extension of the happy household where families reunite without the complicated concerns of humanity. In a discussion about heaven, the novel's wise Aunt Winifred advises the grieving Mary Cabot that when she is reunited in heaven with her beloved brother Roy they will be able to talk and laugh "because there will be no troubles nor sins, no anxieties nor cares, no ugly shades of cross words" ( The Gates Ajar 56). In fact, Winifred's argument is that spirituality can be accepted as anything that the imagination allows as long as "neither reason, nor the Bible, nor common sense, forbids it. Instead of starting it down as an hypothesis to be proved if we can, I lay it down as one Ã³f those probabilities for which Butler would say, 'the presumption amounts to nearly a certainty'" (60).20 Phelps emphasized the material basis of using tangible evidence and logic as a source of Christian morality. Helen Smith writes: "Humanity afforded, through analogy, the best clue to the nature of God" (xxiv). Phelps's complicated hermeneutics engages with liberal Protestantism as well as Calvinism, ultimately relying on analogy, allegory, and common sense reasoning to show that redemption is possible without the Calvinist experience of conversion (Smith xxv). Phelps wants to reconsider scripture</page><page sequence="15">The American "Lives" of Jesus 171 imaginatively and separate it from erroneous interpretations of historical creeds and doctrine. Because her theological reform ideology was outlined so extensively in her works of fiction, Phelps's Ufe of Jesus doesn't really offer anything new to the American negotiation of liberal Protestantism. What is most valuable about her book is her dialectical commentary. Phelps offers an extensive list of what her interpretation does not intend and by doing so, she provides a fairly encompassing overview of the many ways nineteenth-century culture made use of these biographies: This book is not theology or criticism, nor is it biography. It is neither history, controversy, nor a sermon. It makes none of the claims, it assumes none of the pretensions, of any one of these. It is not a study of Jewish life or Oriental customs. It is not a handbook of Palestinian travel, nor a map of Galilean and Judean geography. It is not a creed; it speaks for no sect, it pleads for no doctrine. ( So} vii) By telling the reader all that the book is not, she provides the very categorization needed for an analysis of the dozens of lives-of-Jesus biographies published during the second half of the nineteenth century, a classification that includes hermeneutics, comparative religion, and anthropology. Unfortunately, Phelps never states exactly what the aim of her work is, but her introduction might be taken as a preemptive defense intended to propose that her work is "genre-less." Such a claim stakes its own kind of authority, distancing her from accusations of advancing a theological agenda by promising a neutral text perhaps intended to capture a broader readership. The only major scriptural analysis she offers that sets her work apart is her emphasis on the importance of Lazarus's death and resurrection to the spread of Christianity.21 She suggests that without the Lazarus miracle, there would be no Christianity, which might then be read as her singling out this one account of the miracles as being the only one that bears testimony. Like Beecher, Phelps does not specify whether she believes it is the miracle itself or merely the testimony that is important to the spread of early Christianity: "The future of the Christian faith rested at the crisis, to an extent impossible to measure, upon the necessity that Lazarus should remain a live man for a sufficient time. It has been said that he lived on for thirty years" ( Sof 291). Phelps certainly offers a contribution to liberal Protestantism in her works of fiction - Reynolds labels her as "the most famous describer of Heaven" (202)- but her social reform ideology isn't</page><page sequence="16">172 Lisa Moody as readily apparent in her biographical account of Jesus, nor is her ultimate purpose clear in selecting this mode for her writing, other than such an account by an author of her stature was almost guaranteed to be a best- seller in the late nineteenth century, and it may have conceivably reached a different audience than her fiction did. There is one last biography that bears examining in the context of religious and social reform literature, and that is Mary Austin's A Small Town Man (1915).22 Austin, like Stowe and Phelps, is identified primarily as a writer of fiction, and she is associated with regionalism, yet she is also touted for her willingness to experiment with literary forms (Fetterley 202).23 Although Austin's biographical account of Jesus was not published until well after the turn of the century, it encapsulates many of the social concerns resulting from industrialization. Additionally, her text exemplifies the degree of ambivalence that has come to be associated with the religious subject by the turn of the century as she offers a paradoxical model that simultaneously rejects and insists on external authority. Like the other biographers, Austin focuses on two agendas, theological and social, promoting her own Christology as a means of introducing her vision of reform. She clearly intends to offer a hermeneutical model that rejects sectarian bonds, relying instead on an individualized theology when she writes: "Puritanism and Catholicism are alike, so many turns of the screw that turns out to lead somewhere else" (222). In order to extricate Jesus from the confines of church creed, she presents Jesus as a mystic, in the context of the Holy Spirit, which allows her to apply his "message" to any age: "it was certainly that the ills of society should be healed by the God-powers within us" (Austin 222). 24 Her social-reform agenda is built on her presentation of Jesus as one whose crucifixion was a result of big-city corruption. Allitt writes: "She believed Jesus was crucified because he was in danger of breaking up the corrupt city and temple oligarchy, which was as brazen in its administration as the Tweed Ring of New York" (138). As she presents her argument, Austin's privileging of a pastoral idealism becomes more and more apparent as she invokes a primitive model rejecting the so-called progress of the Industrial Age and, in fact, nearly two thousand years of church history. She describes Jesus as the quintessential country boy: "He was a small-town man and no world-builder" (Austin 89). Austin's view suggests that a focus on small towns and rural America is the source of locating, maintaining, or restoring a system of Christian ethics needed to combat the evils of the Industrial Age. The paradox of Austin's primitivism is that she invokes a premodern</page><page sequence="17">The American "Lives" of Jesus 173 gospel-based model of social reform while she simultaneously rejects the external authority of The Word, relying instead on internal mysticism, a highly intuitive model that responds specifically to contemporary culture. Austin's glorification of the rural ideal is a prevalent theme in late nineteenth-century culture, and it is inextricably entangled with popular social reform theories of this time. In his sociological treatise, The Dangerous Classes of New York , Brace views the restorative powers of country living as a panacea for the ills of inner-city strife. He writes: "If a lad would walk forth to the nearest country village, he would find plenty of healthy and remunerative employment in the ground, as gardener or farmer. And to the country-lad, the farm offers a better chance than a trade" (Brace 37-38). lhe view that city life corrupted society and that industrial capitalism diminished the physical condition of man was ubiquitous. Although Darwinian evolution was widely accepted, industry was faulted for interfering with the process of natural selection. Earlier, in 1867, Karl Marx had written: "But in its blind unrestrainable passion, its were-wolf hunger for surplus-labour, capital oversteps not only the moral, but even the merely physical maximum bounds of the working-day. It usurps the time for growth, development, and healthy maintenance of the body" ( Capital 163). And the idealization of rural life is easy to locate in fiction similarly aimed at developing humankind to its highest potential. Works such as Louisa May Alcott's Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1876) and L. M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables (1908) all offer parallel fictional models of Braces proposal to develop a fostering system among rural farmers in order to "cure" the tarnished lives of the city's abandoned youth. As these religious biographies began to appear in print, religious leaders were also discovering various means of reaching larger audiences via the printed word, and the church leader and the novelist began to usurp each other's audiences. Literary forms were no longer closely associated with occupation as each began to experiment widely with genre. Consequently, the lines became blurred in the designation of authority in the administration of social ethics. Representing the later fundamentalists, for example, is popular Presbyterian preacher Talmage who, although he continued to emphasize a literal reading of scripture, was nevertheless a prominent arbiter of religious reform, making him, even if only controversially, an important figure in the late nineteenth-century liberal Protestant reform culture. He relied heavily on newspaper publishing for dispersing his ideas to a larger audience than could be reached within the confines of even</page><page sequence="18">174 Lisa Moody his enormous New York Tabernacle.25 While Talmage relied primarily on sermonic discourse, Beecher, whom Reynolds calls "the most visible American clergyman in the late nineteenth century" (211), utilized several forms of religious writing, including novels, stories, sermon collections, religious tracts, and poetry - and, of course, one of the many biographies of Jesus, a form of writing that proved popular with the reading public in the nineteenth century, both in America and in Europe. In fact, the religious subject in any form, and particularly religious fiction, was almost certain to find a niche in popular culture. For example, "The two most popular novels in nineteenth-century America were Lew Wallaces Ben Hur (1880) and Charles Sheldon's In His Steps (1896)" (Allitt 128). Reynolds concludes that the predominance of the press over the pulpit suggests that "popular religious writing ... had more than entered the religious mainstream. It had virtually become the mainstream" (211). Popular religious writing has remained in the mainstream ever since.26 With established readerships already in place and a market clearly receptive to religious literature, several major American writers turned to religious biography as a means of dispersing religious and reform ideology into popular culture, and by doing so, these writers shifted power away from the clergy in the administration of social ethics. Social-gospel ideology emerges in tandem with these biographical accounts of the life of Jesus, demonstrating the ways in which Christian moral ethics and social-reform movements functioned as intertwined ideologies in the United States during the late nineteenth century. Reynolds argues that one reason for the theological shift was a changing view toward sin and salvation. He writes: "Sin came to be seen less as the inescapable basis of human nature than as a troublesome but avoidable aspect of the secular environment" (86). Fox concurs in his assertion that it was a changing social world that required a new theology. He writes: "a group of Social Gospel ministers emerged out of the liberal Protestant churches in a humanitarian response to industrialism"' ("Culture" 644). While Reynolds examines the role of fiction rather than biography, he elaborates on a parallel movement in the manner in which popular literature served to disperse social-gospel ideology to a wide audience: "Some authors of the period became so daring as to summon Jesus into modern life" (203). Reynolds specifically mentions the work of William Stead, a British citizen, who wrote "a full-scale statistical analysis of urban ills" (203) titled If Christ Came to Chicago (1893). Steads work was the inspiration for Sheldon's In His Steps . Sheldon's work is "a fascinating guide to the social reform theories of American Protestants in</page><page sequence="19">The American "Lives" of Jesus 175 the depression decade of the 1890s" (Allitt 136), while Lew Wallaces Ben- Hur (1880) offers a comforting compromise between Christian values and enormous wealth, an ideology that came to be known as The Gospel of Wealth, a phrase coined by Andrew Carnegie in 1889 and one that clearly shows the same mediating impulse as social gospel ideology. These two popular works of fiction, In His Steps and Ben-Hur , reflect the ongoing negotiation between Christianity and the new values demanded by industrial capitalism, and therefore, each contributes to the discourse of the religious biographies. Fiction allows a writer to depict a Western image of perfectionism that traditional biography can't quite approach. A preoccupation with the physical features of Jesus demonstrates the fine line between what biography will not allow but what fiction will. While Beecher asserts: "There is absolutely nothing to determine the personal appearance of Jesus" (104), Lew Wallace feels no such compunction to adhere to scriptural authority. In Ben-Hur s gaze, Jesus was draped with hair long and slightly waved, and parted in the middle, and auburn in tint, with a tendency to reddish golden where most strongly touched by the sun. ... As to the other features, it would have been difficult to decide whether they were Greek or Jewish. The delicacy of the nostrils and mouth were unusual to the latter type. . . . (Wallace 413) In Wallace's book, Jesus was born to the blue-eyed Mary and exhibits all the Western features of Hellenic perfectionism. The Occidentalized Jesus stands at an intersection between Orientalist visionary literature and Western imperialist values. Reynolds writes: "The Oriental tale permitted writers to make their ideas palatable and to subvert opposing doctrines while avoiding rigorous debate" (9). It is also worthy of note that such creative descriptions of a Middle Eastern Semitic man are being imagined during the height of American realist literature, reflecting perhaps a negotiation between romantic idealism and realist materialism as well. The fact that so many of the writers of religious biography also wrote homiletic novels emphasizes the relationship between theology, hermeneutics, and realism. Gregory Jackson asserts that scholars have largely overlooked this relationship. He writes: "What critics of literary realism have missed is the extent to which its narrative strategies have emerged from the much older - yet still dynamic - tradition of homiletic realism" (645). Jackson attributes the narrative strategies of both secular</page><page sequence="20">176 Lisa Moody realism and religious realism to "older [Protestant] sermonic and religious pedagogical traditions" (643). He argues that all of these literary forms led to the formation of the social-gospel movement by demanding an active response. He links this reform call to "the hermeneutic of religious allegory [because] homiletic readers ... learned to collaborate with characters through acts of identification, to find in types lifelong role models" (657). The religious biographies worked in the same manner; individuals were to see themselves as "historically grounded subject[s] with transhistorical agency" (654). In this sense, the reader could channel Christian agency simply by imagining himself or herself as the modern day enactment of Jesus. Consider Charles Sheldon's challenge issued by the fictional Reverend Maxwell to his congregation: I want volunteers from the First Church who will pledge themselves, earnestly and honestly for an entire year, not to do anything without first asking the question, 'What would Jesus do?' And after asking that question, each one will follow Jesus exactly as he knows how, no matter what the result may be. (15) Reverend Maxwell's model relies purely on intuitive spirituality. Nowhere in this speech does he suggest a reading of scripture as a guide or source of divine knowledge, and he makes each individual the agent of interpretation and application. Realist fiction operates with the same participatory investment by asking each reader to assume a collective identity with society as a whole. It is always important to remember the relationship between various literary styles in order to examine the discourse that occurred not only between writers of religious biography but within larger literary culture as well. By doing so, we can discover the ongoing reciprocity between social thought, literature, and cultural response. Our understanding of theological and hermeneutical shifts in light of the various literary alternatives nineteenth-century writers deployed allows us to locate various examples of the life of Jesus as a discursive site for thinking about the role of Jesus in contemporary culture. The tendency to draw on scriptural accounts in order to create a biographical chronology of the life of Jesus captures an interesting weave of religious, philosophical, and sociological impulses. Such accounts were not immune from social criticism due to the very authority they claimed to assert, particularly when viewed as an expression of theological reform. Talmage noted early on that religious philosophy had the tendency to appropriate words, phrases,</page><page sequence="21">The American "Lives" of Jesus 177 and details from scripture with the view of advancing specific ideologies: "They cut the Bible to suit their creed instead of cutting their creed to suit the Bible" (12). Talmage himself acquired a huge following by advocating a "literal" interpretation of the Bible and a concept of a united Christian church. Evangelical religion, both the Calvinist Baptists and the Episcopal Methodists, presented the strongest opposition to liberal Protestantism: "By being so adaptable, so full of good will, ... liberal Protestantism failed to distinguish itself forcefully from various secular currents that it flirted with, incorporated, and baptized. It therefore prepared the way for a religious reaction" (Fox, "Culture" 640). The lives-of- Jesus biographies provide a fairly broad and representative history of the religious reforms occurring within traditional Calvinism at the same time that Methodism was growing at a tremendous rate and fundamentalism was also flourishing.27 These biographies also illustrate the diversity of American religious beliefs both in the nineteenth century, in the way Protestantism splintered following the decline of Puritanism, and today, in the way Protestant Christianity continues to be practiced in a democratic United States. In its complex practice, Christianity in America is both ecumenical and highly individuated at the same time. Protestantism can be labeled ecumenical in the sense that church creeds vary widely even within specific denominations, creating inconsistent and artificial boundaries by creed, and yet it is individuated in the way beliefs and practices rest on subjective determinism to a far greater extent than sectarianism. When individual will refuses to yield authority to a larger denomination, even one that assumes the label of "nondenominational" Protestantism, then the idea of a united ecumenical practice remains paradoxical because the possibility of further splintering remains, with subjectivity threatening collectivity. Ironically, the metaphysical authority inherent in these religious manifestos, that is the implicit divine sanctioning of social reform, highlights one of the inevitable outcomes of what Nathan Hatch calls the democratization of American Christianity. By offering a highly individualized personal theology, each of these writers reveals that the figure of Jesus in America is so highly subjective that there can never be a consensus on how to form an ecumenical Christianity that is not threatened with dissension from its very onset. While the term ecumenical seems to invite a diverse and tolerant form of Christianity in American culture, an underlying problem inevitably emerges; the hierarchy of conditions that define Christianity bifurcates. Now, new oppositions relating to knowledge about God, such as</page><page sequence="22">178 Lisa Moody scripture versus intuition and biblical law versus common sense reasoning, create seemingly irreconcilable differences within Protestantism. In short, there needs to be a consensus even in nondenominational Protestantism about whether the central question is what Jesus did or what Jesus would do. Any change to this authoritative order is a cause for dissent, which is not surprising in a culture that was built on dissent. Inevitably, fundamentalism emerges along with the formation of new religious creeds and sects. It is not until the twentieth century that a shift back from the secular to the eschatological allows for a reunification of many individual sects within larger denominations. Turner attributes this later shift away from secular perfection to the publication of William James's Varieties of Religious Experience in 1902. Turner writes: "Somewhat more slowly, even liberal church leaders gave up their facile identification of human betterment with the Kingdom of God - though it took Karl Barth and Reinhold Niebuhr really to shake them loose" (267).28 We can see this central problem in its incipient stages as we follow the discourse of religious biography, and we can see that such shifts logically parallel both the rise and the decline of literary realism. From a literary standpoint, these lives-of- Jesus texts might be viewed as a reflection of the way in which the publishing world privileged materialism during the late nineteenth century. Within these biographies, the materializing or re-imagining of Jesus emphasizes the need for corporeal realism so prevalent in fiction-writing as realist literature found a stronghold in the marketplace. Because so many of these biographies were produced by writers of fiction, writers who already had a huge public following, these biographies also offer an alternative method for examining the use of popular literature as a mode of presenting reform ideologies and for considering the variety of literary options these same writers adopted in order to reach larger audiences. A similar aim continues today in both film and literature, as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Anne Rice's narratives of the life of Christ demonstrate. lhe need to retell an age-old story so that the modern eye can see it performed privileges the ocular orientation of realist writing with its implicit concern for materialism particularly in relation to the religious subject. Of religious fiction, Reynolds asserts: "To secularize sin and salvation was to make them more manageable, to retrieve them from the doubtful realm of metaphysics, and to anchor them in perceivable reality" (211). Reynolds's words reflect a comment that Beecher family biographer Marie Caskey makes about his charismatic theology: "[It was]</page><page sequence="23">The American "Lives" of Jesus 179 Beecher s ability to recreate the personality and experience of Christ and to make his congregations feel as if they were drawn irresistibly to that figure that made Henrys Christology so much more powerful than [his brothers] Edwards or Charles's" (374). As each of these biographers presents the figure of Jesus as a model of human rather than divine perfectionism, each offers a presumably attainable model of moral and ethical behavior that might be realized in the modern world. It is this idea of attainability that places these works into a dialogue with the aesthetics of literary realism. By offering a model of behavior that presumes to reflect the anterior world outside of the text, these writers combine a metaphysical concept of authority, the implicit endorsement of Jesus, with their social-reform visions for dealing with the conditions and concerns of late nineteenth-century industrial culture. Lousiana State University NOTES !See Charles Howard Hopkins, "God's Kingdom and 'Our Country,"' 98-117. 2 Roger Lundin writes: "In the decades after [the Civil War], the primacy of experience became the premise and the promise of pragmatism, the one genuinely indigenous philosophical movement America has ever produced" (3). 3 Warren Kissinger writes: "Without a doubt, it aroused more excitement and controversy than any work about Jesus before or since" (21). 4 These include, for example, Jesuss healing of lepers (Matthew 8, Mark 1, Luke 5, Luke 17), and his turning water into wine at the wedding of Cana (John 2). 5 Within the sentimental religious novel, another popular American literary genre, any mention of Strauss or Renan works mimetically to suggest higher criticism, which in turn undercuts biblical authority (Suderman 62). 6 Roger Lundin points out that even the notion of sola scriptura has both a conventional and a radical interpretation; he asserts that "many evangelical Protestants made instrumental theories central to their views on biblical interpretation ... [by construing] a reading of the Bible as a private encounter ensconced in heaven and a reader removed from history" (26). 7 Applegate writes that two particular concepts, the existence of hell and the possibility of original sin, eventually forced Beecher to renounce his Calvinist beliefs altogether (462). Thomas Jenkins provides compelling evidence that even the idea of the crucifixion was troublesome for Beecher (66). 8 For example, Beecher discusses Renans argument that Jesus was born in Nazareth and not Bethlehem; according to other historical records, the census for which Joseph was traveling to register, under the governance of Quirinius, wasn't</page><page sequence="24">180 Lisa Moody assessed until ten years after the purported birth of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels. Beecher mentions the problem in a footnote, but adds no further comment (21). 9 Niebuhrs five typologies are: "Christ Against Culture," "Christ of Culture," "Christ Above Culture," "Christ and Culture in Paradox," and "Christ the Transformer of Culture" (40-43). Niebuhr readily admits "a type is always something of a construct [and] ... it is evident at once that no person or group ever conforms completely to a type, [but that this method] has the advantage of calling attention to the continuity and significance of the great motifs that appear and reappear in the long wrestling of Christians with their enduring problem" (44). 10 Beecher discusses the miracles and the primitive mind in several sections of The Life of Jesus, the Christ For example, he writes: "To us the narratives of the Gospel ought to mean far more than to the primitive disciple, or they have been germs without development, seed without harvest" (6). See also The Life of Jesus 147, 164, 277, and 311. 11 Allitt elaborates on the manner in which Beecher applied evolutionary theory to civilization as a whole, substituting progression for adaptation: "Some ministers regarded Darwin's evolutionary theory as a threat to their faith, but Beecher welcomed it. He came to believe that religious thought was subject to the same evolutionary processes as were human beings themselves and that, accordingly, the Gospels needed to be rewritten to take advantage of recent progress" (132). 12 Brace is referring particularly to the Germans and the Irish (70) although he finds the German beer gardens to be less harmful than Irish and American bars. 13 As Allitt points out, we can trace the rhetorical influence of Beecher s liberal Protestant hermeneutics through an examination of the lives-of- Jesus discourse. At the same time, it is difficult to assess the popular reaction to Beechers Life of Jesus because it was published just before the details of the "Beecher-Tilton scandal" appeared in print in October of 1872 (Applegate 422), and the adultery charges dominated the press. In his extensive history of this event, Fox writes: "The amount of printed material devoted to the Beecher-Tilton scandal is stupefying" ( Trials of Intimacy 296). Suffragist and purported spiritualist Victoria Woodhull publicly charged the married Beecher with conducting an adulterous affair with Elizabeth Tilton, the wife of Beechers good friend and publisher Theodore Tilton. Nearly every account of Beechers experience writing the first volume of his originally planned two-part life-of-Jesus biography is overshadowed with accounts of the scandal. Fox writes: "The Beecher-Tilton scandal was a cultural crisis, page one news everywhere for a solid year" ("Culture" 642). Similarly, the adultery charges and subsequent civil lawsuit filed by Tilton in 1875 absorbed the public for years and prevented Beecher from completing the commissioned second volume: "A fatality seemed to have hung over that book" (William Beecher 673). Beechers literary work and the Tilton scandal have been irrevocably linked ever since due to Libby Tilton s involvement in the writing of the book. When Beecher biographer Paxton Hibben dryly comments that the earlier chapters of "'The Life of ChrisÅ¥ ... had been conceived in the little house on Livingston street" (297), he is referring to</page><page sequence="25">The American "Lives" of Jesus 181 the many hours Beecher spent discussing his work in the private company of Libby Tilton at her home. Whatever reception the Life of Jesus might have generated- in fact, Jackson describes it as "enormously popular" (646)- its literary presence was clearly overshadowed by competing newspaper accounts of the life of Beecher. 14 There is a larger hermeneutic issue at stake than the just literal-minded versus interpretive approaches to scripture; the underlying issue is the relative importance of the Bible and not just how the Bible is read. Many Protestant sects divided over the question of sola scripturay which is the belief that the Bible is the only source of religious authority as opposed to one of several sources of religious knowledge. Mark Noll believes there was a major shift in American Christianity in 1861, a date he identifies through his reading of the many religious tracts that demonstrate the new "Bible alone" approach to certain sects of Protestant theology (370-71). Another significant divide can be traced to Quaker theology, in which intuition is given greater weight than the written word: "The most impressive development of the doctrine of the inner light was provided by a Scottish Quaker theologian named Robert Barclay. His Apology , published in English in 1678, makes the case for the inner light against any external authority, including the Bible" (Wentz 80). In these lives-of- Jesus biographies, we can see a connection to Quaker mysticism, particularly in the work of Mary Austin. 15 Paul Gutjahr explains some of the misconceptions about Bible editions. He writes: "By 1880, nearly two thousand different editions of the Bible were available to Americans" (3). The difference in these editions was mainly pictorial or illustrative (inclusions of maps, for example) rather than textual (66). He confirms the dominance of the King James translation: "For nearly two centuries, the King James Version would reign supreme in the United States. Only in the early years of the nineteenth century would this hegemony begin to show signs of erosion. Oddly enough, the reasons for this deterioration were similar to those that allowed for the creation of the King James Version. Once again, there was a concern that the people needed the Bible presented to them in their own common idiom along with scholarly attention paid to original' sources" (92). 16 For a discussion of Stowe's feminist hermeneutics in both Women in Sacred History (1873) and Footsteps of the Master , see Elrod 695-719. 17 Thomas Jenkins points out that Stowe listed "Jonathan Edwards in his History of the Work of Redemption , Isaac Watts in his True Glory of Christy and John Milton in Paradise Lost- a motley group to call 'sound theologians'" (72). 18 Monika Elbert writes: "Phelps wrote fifty-seven books (including five collections of short stories), as well as hundreds of essays and short stories, two collections of verse, and even two plays" (441). 19 O'Connor elaborates on Phelps's success with her readership: "For a reading audience with modest religious allegiances, her fiction provided immediate gratification for the gnawing questions of mortality and immortality without insisting upon any doctrinal pre-conditions" (162).</page><page sequence="26">182 Lisa Moody 20 The reference is to Butler's Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed , to the Constitution and the Course of Nature (1736) (Smith xxiv). 21 This account is told in John 11. 22 The original 1915 title was The Man Jesus. The earlier edition omitted the final chapter concerning mysticism for fear that Austin's use of this term (and the term genius) "were so little understood by American readers that the point of [the] real conclusions would be entirely missed" (Austin v). She continues on to elaborate on her "real conclusions" which involve her analysis and estimate of Jesus as a mystic (vi). 23 In their discussion of Austins innovative prose, Fetterley and Pryse cite Elizabeth Ammons, Conflicting Stories: American Women Writers at the Turn of the Twentieth Century (New York: Oxford UP, 1991): 201-02. 24 The appropriation of the authority of the Holy Spirit is not an argument unique to Austin. Ironically, a similar argument had been made earlier by conservative Protestant sects when they refused to yield the authority of the King James Bible at the advent of the 1881 revisions. Talmage and other evangelists asserted that earlier translators of the King James edition were moved by the Holy Spirit, so that while modern translators might dispute these English translations of the Greek language, their divine sanction could not be undermined (Szasz 20). 25 David Reynolds writes: "In 1885 Talmage initiated a worldwide sermon syndicate whereby his piquant sermons reached an estimated twenty million readers by being reprinted in three thousand newspapers, prompting the London Times to comment that 'the whole human race was his congregation'" (210). 26 Richard Fox writes: "The Library of Congress owns 17,239 books about Jesus and 7,719 more about God" (JiA 20). 27 Ferenc Szasz asserts that fundamentalism was a response to "the spread of liberalism" (71), but that the term fundamentalism was not coined until 1920 (72). 28 See also Lundin 9 1 -94 and Reinhold Niebuhr, The Nature and Destiny of Man: A Christian Interpretation , vol. 1 (New York: Scribner's, 1943).
