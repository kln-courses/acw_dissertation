<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES OF AL-MAcARRI Until modern times, the only forms of dramatic representation known fairly widely and continuously among Arabs were the shadow play and the Qarah-Goz puppet show.' And-although the texts of some shadow plays by Ibn Daniyal (d. 1311) have been preserved- neither of these forms of entertainment produced a dramatic literature of recognized worth. This lack has attracted the attention of some Orientalists, and of many Arab Modernists.2 The discussion has not always been free of the polemical spirit, for any observation that implies or seems to imply the cultural or racial inferiority of the Arabs naturally calls for spirited rebuttal-even so outdated a writer as Renan can still draw fire. Fortunately, the very success of modern writers in fields previously untilled, by demonstrating that variations in achievement need indicate no innate or permanent differences of creative ability, has taken the heat out of the debate. Indeed one modern Arab critic has pronounced himself willing to consider the possibility that Taine's views on the influence of racial as well as environmental factors may not be altogether irrelevant to this question,3 for it is not inconceivable that even racial peculiarities might come to be recognized and usefully compared without implying superiority and inferiority. This is not, however, a field of speculation that has found favour In addition to articles listed in Index Islamicus, see Jacob Landau; Studies in the Arab Theater and Cinema; Philadelphia, 1958; pp. 1-47.

Most commonly, the Greeks are taken to be creators of all drama, and the absence of an Arab dramatic literature is ascribed to inadequate contact with the Greek heritage at the relevant point: Aristotle's Rhetoric and especially his Poetics were so grossly mis- understood that Tragedy was identified with panegyric, and Comedy with satire; and in the Greek plays themselves the Arabs never took any interest. This lack of interest is in turn ascribed to a number of environmental and cultural influences. Tawfiq al-Hakim's contention is that the physical presence of a theatre is essential to the birth of drama, whereas the Arab literary tradition was formed in nomadic times, when such a building was an impossibility. More commonly, the inhibiting factor named is religion-not merely in the sense that Islam discouraged the appearance of women on the stage or the study of a literature concerned with pagan gods, but rather in the subtler and more pervasive sense that the religious tradition of the Arabs- even pre-Islamic-was averse to such anthropomorphic and even half-human gods as those of the Greeks, round whom beautiful legends and stirring incidents could be woven. The argument is not entirely satisfying. Of several objections that may be levelled against it, the most germane is that a religious feeling so decisive as is implied here might also have been expected to inhibit miniature painting and Shi'ah passion plays - or are they better called "pageants" ?-on the martyrdom of al-Hasan and al-Husayn. But my purpose here is not to debate so broad a question, though one general observation may be offered that has some bearing on what is to follow. It is that the absence of great drama in classical Arabic literature ought not to be studied on its own, but as part of the wider fact that this literature developed no genre that calls for sustained and integrated invention. Its characteristic productions are either short or made up of short independent pieces-perhaps because it was for long the literature of a society entirely at one about its supreme values, look- ing to its artists not for the revelation of some great new truths but for the satisfaction of its well-formed tastes. A subsidiary line of enquiry has been to look for a dramatic quality in the literature actually produced. Some have seen it in the very stance of the poet apostrophizing the ruined encampment or declaiming his resounding ode in the presence of the mighty.' Others have sought it wherever a poet-such as Waddkih al-Yaman or Imru' al-Qays- 1 Idwar Hunayn; op. cit.</page><page sequence="3">'T'HE DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES OF AL-MA 'ARRI 131 reported the words exchanged between themselves and the women they courted.' Yet others point to the dialogue and theatrical situations found in the maqdmdt, to which in fact some shadow-plays are said to bear a certain resemblance.2 A subtler observation is that Ibn ar-Riumi has a trick of personifying abstract qualities and of making them interact like characters on a stage.3 Here again Tawfiq al-Hakim's contribution to the argument is distinctive. He accepts as universally applicable Hugo's contention that the main stages of mankind's development are the primitive, the ancient, and the modern; and that the corresponding poetic moods are lyrical, then epic, and finally dramatic.4 He takes it that lyricism is essentially an expression of the individual's spontaneous reactions to the universe around him, whereas the epic reflects social purposes and endeavours, and drama is the result of intellectual development of thought. He then goes on to assert that classical Arabic literature has indeed fulfilled these gradations of expression in "aim" though not in form. The flourish with which this last antithesis is made is somewhat surprising since Hugo was not discussing form; yet it is maintained in the illustration chosen by al-Hakim to support his contention: 5 In the cAbbasid period alone, we find that al-Buhturi comes before al-Mutanabbi and al-Mutanabbi before Abui l-'Ala'. Had these poets been planted in Greek soil, then al-Buhturl (the singer of the Arabs) would have been Pindar; al-Mutanabbi, who down the centuries reproduces in our ears the clanking of swords, would have been Homer; and Abfi l-cAla', who to us represents consideration of Man and his destiny and of the exalted Realm, would have been Aeschylus. Of course these observations in their varying degrees of validity point at best to the existence of disparate dramatic "features" in the Arab classics. They do not amount to a dramatic literature, or even to the germ of an Arab theatre. The more reputable Arab critics to-day take this for granted; they are quick to deride the naivete of those who call out "Drama!" at every instance of direct speech, and A view derided by Taha Husayn in Haditb al-Arbicd', I; Cairo, 1937, pp. 293-303. 2 Mahmuid Rizq Salim; "Risalat ad-Dar "an Muhawarat al-Far;" Ris/ala, XVI, 804 (29 Nov. 1948); pp. 1349-51. 3 Taha Husayn; Min Hadiih ash-Shi'r wia n-Alathr; Cairo, 1936, pp. 141-5. 4 La Preface de Cromwell, esp.-in Maurice Souriau's 7th ed., Paris, n.d.- pp. 175-215. 3 al-Malik Cd7b, intro., pp. 27-8.</page><page sequence="4">132 THE DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES OF AL-MA'ARRI give short shrift to lesser brethren who would argue that the modern Arab theatre has its roots anywhere but in European models. There is nevertheless one classical Arabic work in which an appar- ently deliberate attempt-not unsuccessful, yet so far unnoticed-was made at dramatic expression. By what can hardly be claimed to be more than a coincidence, this is by the very man whom al-Hakim- arguing on an altogether different plane-named as the most dramatic of Abbasid literary figures: al-Ma'arri. The work is ad- Dir'iyydt, a collection of thirty poems all concerned with descriptions of armour, sometimes considered a separate book though more usually treated as an appendage of SiqI aZ-Zand. It is not altogether surprising that this little collection, concerned as it is with a subject of no intrinsic interest to moderns, has often been dismissed-perhaps unread-as a blind poet's exercise in deriv- ative description, a proof of virtuosity but scarcely of originality. There are so many provocative sides to al-Ma'arri's life and writings that attention has-naturally and rightly-been focussed on the more massive manifestations of his genius: the novelty and the ambiguities of his Risdlat al-Ghufran, his unorthodoxy coupled with his apparent overindulgence in the rhetorical tricks dear to his contemporaries in the LuZfimiyydt, his proud and wilful rejection of the world, his haunt- ing concern with death. It is curious to note nevertheless that even a critic as sympathetic to al-Ma'arri as Taha Husayn did, in his younger days, examine the Dir'iyydt I with the specific purpose of finding out why Ma'arri took such a strange interest in armour that he had never worn; he could only fall back on the conjecture that, having memorized a great deal on the subject, the blind poet wished to display his artistic skill. And although he thought al-Macarri deserved credit as the first poet to compose an entire diwdn on a single theme, his judgment on the poems was: The Dircyyjt do not deserve toilsome research or prolonged discussion. They ought rather to be appended to the descriptive pieces in Siql at-Zand, for they do not go beyond elaborating on comparisons of suits of armour now with pools of water now with locusts' eyes, or celebrating how effective they are in denting swords and smashing lances, and [therefore] in protecting their wearers. The pre-Islamic idiom is prevalent in them, their style is clearly beduin, and they abound in rare words. Imagination does play a part in blending these descriptions inherited from the Jahills. Thus the poet has composed I Tajdid Dbikra Abi 1-cA/i' (3rd. ed), Cairo, 1937, pp. 193, 215-6, 228.</page><page sequence="5">THE DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES OF AL-MA 'ARRM 133 a dialogue between armour and sword, another between a lad and a woman who has sold his father's armour; yet another is in the words of a man driven by necessity to sell his armour. In all this he does no more than create various ways of incorporating in [his] verse what he has learnt from other poets' descriptions of armour. The passage-inaccurate at least in its reference to dialogues- comes close to pointing out the main claim of the Dir'iyydt to original- ity, but throws it away as a mere device. It is true that descriptions of armour loom large in every one of the thirty poems, that these descriptions are derivative (though pre-Islamic models are scarcely the ones that come most readily to one's mind), that they abound in tropes and in far-fetched "cerebral" comparisons which bring together images from totally unrelated realms of experience. But what is significant is that only eight of these poems are descriptive pieces pure and simple: of these five are on armour, one on an armed encounter, one on a spear that has got bent in a vain attack on armour, and one on women who have worn armour. All the others purport to be in the words of a certain person or of a suit of armour personified. They thus attempt to adopt the standpoint of an imaginary character in a given situation. The dramatic element in these impersonations is sometimes very slight. Four are merely in the words of a man describing his armour. One in which the armour addresses a sword and another in which it taunts a spear may be said to come under the heading of mufdkharah. Yet another, in which a man boasts of his prowess in war, and two more cast in the words of men who have grown too old to wear armour, come close to oft-recurring motifs in Arabic poetry. But in not a few, the poet projects himself into a situation of some complexity: he speaks for a man who has pledged his armour, and is not allowed to retrieve it; for another offering his armour for sale; for another whose wife wishes that he should sell his armour; for the guest of a woman who has offered her jewelry in exchange for his armour; for one who has exchanged his armour for camels; for someone advising another to remove the rust from his armour; for a man addressing someone to whom he has lent his armour; for one who has offered his armour as dowry for a woman; for another who recalls a woman for whom, had he sold his armour, he would have been able to give a rich dowry; for a man addressing a woman whose father has cheated him of a suit of armour; for a woman advising her son not to marry but to seek honour wearing his armour; and</page><page sequence="6">134 THE DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES OF AL-MA'ARRI for a lad asking his mother what has happened to his father's armour. This last one is the most markedly dramatic. Below is a full trans- lation of it, with a few additions-marked out by square brackets- intended to make plain to the English reader associations and assump- tions that would be implicit in an Arab's mind. It speaks well for it that the situation out of which it arises, though not explicitly described in the preamble, can be clearly visualized: A young lad, probably orphaned early in life, has come to the age when he imagines himself capable of deeds of valour comparable to those he believes his father to have accomplished. Eagerly he looks for his father's armour, but it is nowhere to be found. The budding "man of the family" is incensed, and calls his mother to account. With heavy irony he offers various surmises as to what might have happened to the armour, before losing himself in exalted imaginings of what it must have been like. It runs: 1. What has happened to my father's armour? Did it flow [out] with a river? Did it march [away] on foot? 2. Is it that it was borrowed from the Serpents,' and that the children of affliction have since reclaimed their own? 3. Did you in answer to necessity sell it, one barren year of skies unclouded, 4. When neither was earth softened by the boon of Pleiades nor was the strap of leather bucket moistened [in the well], 5. [A year] when Pisces floundered thirsty, in scant waters undisturbed by dashing waves- 6. A frowning year when on the young gazelle Leo bestowed only faint drizzles? 7. Or did you make of it his shroud-though such is not among the appurtenances of the grave- 8. That he might appear in armour on the day when to corpses souls return ? 9. Did you consign it to one you trusted yet proved false-and ugliest of all traits is treachery? 10. Or have [my father's] virtuous daughters converted it into more pendants and more anklets? 11. Broad in build, and bright, enfolding no dark patch [of rust], 12. It is-as shafts belabour it-like a pool in rugged ground replenished by persistent rains, 1 The reference is either to actual serpents, whose markings resemble mail, or to a tribe so named. Similar "double entendre" of the kind known as ibdm is intended in 11.4-6 where the play is on animal species after which constellations are named. The entire poem is, of course, full of tropes.

Or [since the arrows are feathered] like a water-point round which doves circle, their down alighting upon it, but without breaking the surface. 14. Niggardly is its master in respect of it, for it is niggardly of him- and often does such niggardliness spring from a generous nature! 15. Well may you think it made up of the mouth-watering of a morning cloud, or of its copious tears. 16. It laughs at the arrows, it mocks the lances, it ridicules the swords. 17.

Hoary is it, but it has been white from birth; Its hoariness is not due to age. 21. Its whiteness we therefore do not reckon as decrepitude Though whiteness is usually so regarded. 22. [And even as pious men, following the Prophet's example, have their white beards dyed,] It has been dyed by swords and lances, but only with the blood that these have spattered; 23. So marvel at the sight: one who is no ascetic is yet stained with [the like of] reddish or black dye. 24.

They are like the thorns of tragacanth or mimosa, And it is like the mouth of an old and hardened camel, capable of reducing them. The first ten lines at least are not unworthy of being called a dramatic monologue. Though the characterization is somewhat marred by over-subtle word-plays on the names of constellations, the heavy sarcasm is what may be expected of a self-important adolescent. Even the elaborate, extravagant, somewhat unreal comparisons that follow would not be out of place in the mouth of a lad whose knowledge of war derives from golden fantasy rather than experience. It would be almost certainly too much to claim that such effects were intended and deliberately worked out by al-Ma'arri; for one thing, the exuberant imagery that may be noted here is encountered in the other poems as well, different though the contexts are. Yet the fact that so many of the Dir'iyydt are presented as monologues suggests that the poet must have been experimenting with the form with some continuity and to some purpose. P. J. E.
