One cylinder from Gonur Depe (Margiana) de picts such composite beings (flg. 14)24 and an other from eastern Iran (fig. 15), published by Porada and Amiet, represents almost the same bird/human composition as on the Hasanlu bowl. In the Oxus Civilization and Eastern Iranian compositions, the bird-human composite being is associated/opposed to snakes (i.e. dragon) by iconographic construction; shall we consider here that the graphic contact via the lion's tail indicates such association/opposition? In this case we may introduce, after the "graphic con tact," "association by duplication" or thematic contact.25 Then can we exclude the possiblity that the woman with a long dress "riding" the eagle might be the same as the woman seated on the lion? Whatever the answer, again, it is strik ing to see that this composition is in the middle register while on the earlier Oxus Civilization and related images they appeared above the fig ures of other entities in iconographic hierarchy. v. Libation in front of a throne: the bearded man seated in front of an empty throne (seat, table) and holding a vase also has been widely commented on. Here again we can cite an Oxus Civilization parallel. On the remarkable Gonur cylinder men tioned above (fig. 14), we can see two individuals holding cups or offerings (?) seated in front of a square motif that could be a temple, an altar or a throne (or a combination).26 But when we look at an Eastern Iranian cylinder we see that tem ple, altar and throne are associated (figs. 16, 17). Therefore the libation before an empty seat may give another link with the Oxus Civilization, and a sort of vase on an offering table on the Gonur Depe cylinder of our fig. 14, and other artifacts 176</page><page sequence="7">f rancfort: A Note on the Hasanlu Bowl Fig. 11.

Another clue is given by the graphic contact of the wheel of the first chariot and a leg of a horse of the second chariot of the upper register with the throne. Thus, we may consider that instead of the generally female enthroned deities of the Oxus Civilization and Eastern Iran, we have here a libation linked to one or two of the deities of the upper register of the Hasanlu bowl.27 Moreover, if we turn now to the thematic contact ("associa tion by duplication") we may look at the priest of the upper register who stands holding a cup or a beaker (see below). vi.

The presence of groups of Aryas or (proto)-Indo-Aryas in Iran before the Iranians, proposed by Burrow71 is accepted by Fussman,72 but is questioned in her study of Al akakh texts by von Dassow, who minimizes the Aryas as early incomers, as an ethnic group and as a ruling group in a Hurrian Mitanni.73 The pres ent analysis of the Hasanlu bowl might give more substance to the hypothesis of the religious in fluence of Arya groups in Western Iran at some point. However, we do not pretend that the Hur rian "reading" that proposes to identify images as Kumarbi, Tesub, Ullikummi, Istar, Sausga, a "reading" favored by Winter in her comprehen sive study of 1989, has been invalidated. Simply, our "reading" gives more consistency to the up per register deities (not simply as Tesub, sun and moon facing sacrificers), the key element being the identification of the Asvin. One hopes that future discoveries will bring new evidence for the validation, or not, of this hypothesis.
