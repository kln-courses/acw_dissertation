The Truth Won by Means of Film Everyone who cares for his art seeks the essence of his own technique. – Dziga Vertov, 1922 Signals Many of Bekhterev’s students were artists, including the writer Isaac Babel,  the directors Grigori Boltanski and Abram Room and, one of the most  famous, Dziga Vertov.1 This has been pointed out by Herbert Marshall,  who had worked as Joris Ivens’s assistant in the Soviet Union and who  had been personally acquainted with Vertov since his visit to Germany in  1929. Marshall was in fact surprised that many artists had studied at the  Psychoneurological Institute with no intention of becoming physicians,  but then maintains Viktor Shklovsky’s claim that the institute was the only  place that had not restricted access to Jews through quotas, thus providing  an opportunity to assimilate into Russian society by means of an academic  degree.2 This explanation established the connection for f ilm history be- tween Vertov’s theory of the kino-eye and the experiments that Bekhterev  was conducting in his laboratories. In Vertov’s journals and workbooks,  however, there are a handful of revealing comments about how much his  f ilms and his theories are indebted to the methods of objective psychology.  When he began working at the Moscow Film Ministry immediately after the  October Revolution, Vertov noted in the third person – observing himself: He went there after having a few experiences in the areas of language  and sound. From the artistic recording ‘The Sawmill,’ to montages of  stenograms and audio recordings and the creative workshop ‘Laboratory  of Hearing’; from the recordings of various ‘chastushki’3 to stenographed  confessions; from primitive interceptions of truth to attempts at mind read- ing; from self-experiments at the Leningrad Psychoneurological Institute  (recordings of thoughts, reactions, forms of behavior) to reflections about  surprise recordings for attaining truth; from observing the Pathé newsreels  at the cinema to thinking about visually recording the visible world, about  the visual shape of the world, about the truth to be won by means of f ilm.4 This list is Vertov’s biography as a series of recording experiments and  consequently a very brief media history of a Kinopravda. As a student he  </page> <page sequence="4"> 250 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  had experimented with using letters to write down the sound of a sawmill  and sounds of nature. The outcome of these attempts to depict reality in  a symbolic order had above all clarif ied for him the limits of writing as a  recording technology, which could only manage more or less successful  reductions in the realm of acoustic events with its possible combinations  of 32 Cyrillic, preordained individual elements. Vertov then bought an  old phonograph, with which he could record, store, and manipulate the  vibrations of the noises of the world on cylinders, still without a microphone,  according to frequency and amplitude.5 In this continuous analogue record- ing Vertov made his own cuts and edited the noises and voices into audio  plays. Initially he recorded human language in traditional literary form  and then as free speaking. Liberated by phonographic recording from the  compulsion of rhyme or rhythm, the old mnemomics, language could then  become voices, breathing, faltering, or hoarsely croaking like a sawmill in  the distance. The experiments at the Psychoneurological Institute ultimately led  to Vertov’s theory of documentary f ilm. Just as the reflexologists turned  thoughts – which, according to Sechenov and Bekhterev, are inhibited  reflexes – reactions, and behaviors into objects of objective psychological  examination as processes that can be observed, measured and stored by  means of apparatuses, Vertov replaced the old recording technology of  writing, which had implemented its transformative rule as a spirit in things  and people, with technical media that could work without introspective  additions, without the poetry of self-perception, because they stored  acoustic and optical reality in their physical qualities. Using experimental  and applied psychology, the human being – just like things and animals  – was transformed into the events and dimensions of data, which were  transformed according to the corresponding new rules. A new image of  people could only be realized through this transformation, and Vertov was  one of the most careful of its engineers. Vertov’s study of psychic reactions and reflexes in his self-experiments,  that is, his attempts at self-portrayal with the camera, make it possible to  calculate the “ego” on f ilm and to “relate it to the machine.” Thus arose  an ego-kino-eye or a kino-eye-ego, which could move through the world  beyond the limits of the old consciousness. A kino-eye that speaks from the  manifestos in the first person, like in the text entitled “Kinoks-A Revolution”: Now I, a camera, f ling myself along their resultant, maneuvering in the  chaos of movement, recording movement, starting with movements  composed of the most complex combinations. Freed from the rule of  </page> <page sequence="5"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 251 sixteen-seventeen frames per second, free of the limits of time and space,  I put together any given points in the universe, no matter where I’ve  recorded them. My path leads to the creation of a fresh perception of the  world. I decipher in a new way a world unknown to you.6 Human being and machine form a new optics, which dismantles the staged  presentation of the world into the individual parts of its movement, thus dis- covering and displaying how the historical treatment of reality-data at the  basis of human perception works. Vertov transfers the signal character from  his experiments with acoustic recordings to f ilm. The “zhizn’ vrasplokh”,  the life caught unawares, or, to go back to Walter Benjamin’s anti-bourgeois  methodology of observing history, life viewed as “non-intentional”, shows  the historical reality by technical means. Sophie Küppers, the wife of El Lis- sitzky, translated the texts for Vertov’s trip to Europe in 1929 and introduced  once and for all the term “überrumpeltes Leben” [“life caught unawares”]  into German literature for Vertov’s technique of documentary f ilm.7 From the beginning Vertov’s technique was not only seen as an attack  on bourgeois conventions and tragedies [Trauerspiele], but on the bourgeois  subject of seeing. The truth exposed by the “life caught unawares” are the  multiple, universal reactions and relations that remain unconscious – al- though still visible and measureable – when staging the everyday. The truth  of this “zhizn’ vrasplokh”, of the life unconsciously caught unawares, means  that all seeing and measuring of social relationships is based on historical  technologies. The truth of depiction cannot be other than an analysis of the  character of the technology through which it is produced. That this is no  tautology in the practical work with apparatuses, but becomes epistemol- ogy, was repeated by Godard when he calls f ilm truth 24 times per second  in Le Petit Soldat. Vertov experienced this with own body. Vertov described his f irst foray into f ilm history as a self-experiment in  the terms of objective psychology. In 1918 he jumped from a height of one  and a half stories behind the f ilm committee’s palace, while a cameraman  f ilmed the jump in slow motion. Vertov’s different emotional states on the  way down could then be analyzed using this f ilm. While in real time all that  could be seen was him bowing, smiling, and jumping, the slow motion of the  f ilm established the physical sequence of fear and indecisiveness, embar- rassment, growing conviction, and so on. These were basic organic-reflex  types that the associative-reflex physicality of the heroic could be traced  back to, according to the experiments at Bekhterev’s institute. Manipulat- ing the time axis allowed for about 18 truths per second in 1918. The time  became relative, so that even the terms “time lapse” and “slow motion” were  </page> <page sequence="6"> 252 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  exchangeable depending on the standpoint taken. Vertov analyzed his fall,  which can be considered the origin of a Kinopravda, in 1935: From the viewpoint of the ordinary eye you see untruth. From the  viewpoint of the cinematic eye (aided by special cinematic means, in  this case, accelerated shooting) you see the truth. If it’s a questions of  reading someone’s thoughts at a distance (and often what matters to us  is not to hear a person’s words but to read his thoughts), then you have  that opportunity right here. It has been revealed by the kino-eye. It is  possible, by means of the kino-eye to remove a man’s mask...8 When Vertov jumped, the truth of observation was still invoked against  the culture of writing from the old bureaucracy, which sought to grasp  and censor the spirit of artworks and artists. Storing human data on f ilm  was established precisely in opposition to the bureaucratic version. In 1935,  when Vertov wrote down his memories of the jump, and when his f ilm Three  Songs about Lenin was not explicitly censored, but was put aside by the  distribution off ices, it had thus already become a bureaucratic technique  to censor without words and writing. There was plenty of opportunity “not  to hear a person’s words but to read his thoughts.”9 What is essential about  Vertov’s discovery, however, is that the truth of f ilm does not lie on its visual  surface, but in the processing of discrete individual images, through which  new qualities of reality appear that are invisible without f ilm. Vertov’s  experiments situate f ilm exactly between its signal character, which allows  for manipulating the time axis, and the visual character, which causes all  kinds of shapes to appear on the surface. In the tradition of the experiments at the Psychoneurological Institute, in  which Vertov placed his f ilm experiments, the self-experiment corresponds  to an experiment from the series of “physical reflexes”, with which move- ments and reactions could be tested “that characterize the inner state under  certain conditions.”10 It strictly adheres to the psycho-ref lex method of  rejecting introspection, but giving free reign to subjective processes in order  to compare them with the results of simultaneous objective observation.  Bekhterev had written: It is thus clear that the method of reflexology maintains the possibility  not only of studying the processes of human association-reflex from the  objective side, but also to explain the relationship of subjective processes  to them. Such a research method is very valuable when conducted on one’s  own person, particularly with regard to the mimic-somatic processes...11 </page> <page sequence="7"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 253 The ideal of psycho-reflexology research is to combine subjective and objec- tive protocols of experimentation: such as a written working journal and a  simultaneous f ilm recording, or even better, the “journal of a cameraman”,  which itself is f ilmed at the same time, a journal with “impressions on  celluloid in six rolls” attached, as is stated precisely in the intertitle of the  famous Chelovek s kinoapparatom from 1929. In early f ilm theory, not only in  Vertov, the cinematic apparatus was advanced to an epistemological device.  The special consequence that Vertov draws from this is that the cinematic  apparatus is thus no longer any kind of representational apparatus, but,  as a visual medium of storage and transfer, is an instrument for analyzing  and synthesizing, producing a new reality of perception. The enduring  debate about whether Vertov’s f ilms are documentary or f iction films comes  unraveled if we understand them as universalizing labor conditions. Film- ing becomes an experimental construction for directors, camera operators,  editors, and – as Rouch and Morin would later claim for French cinema as  well, in Vertov’s name – it changes them as well. Despite the critique of the f ilm bureaucracy, Vertov holds fast to the  scientif ic character of the kinoglaz research. In his notes for a conversation  from July 28, 1935, presumably with the photo correspondent from the  newspaper “Prozhektor”, he writes: “I work like Pavlov’s laboratory and not  like a department at the f ilm chronicle... ”12 At the main building of Pavlov’s  Biological Station in Koltushi near Leningrad, one can read, chiseled in  stone: “Observation and observation.” This was only the half-truth of the  laboratories, the other half was produced previously by the experimental  set-up and the apparatuses. Bekhterev had also called his own ability to  observe into question, more methodically than Pavlov had, in his Objective  Psychology, and then again in relation to the observation instruments.  Vertov, who also did not want to rely on his own eyes, thus is methodologi- cally closer to him than to Pavlov. But in 1935 it was still permitted to name  the Nobel Prize winner to describe his own working method as methods  from reflexology. Bekhterev, on the other hand, who preferred to leave what  the essence of the human being is and could be up to the essence of the  apparatus and to the essence of relationship produced by them, had been  deemed unutterable since 1927. Agitations Although the whole arsenal of optical illusions, animations, and manipula- tions were played out in the f ilms of the Kinoki, although Vertov considered  </page> <page sequence="8"> 254 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  animation filming one of the “chief positions”13 in the Kinoki’s work, he views  his method as a way to explain reality. He harshly criticizes practices that  obfuscate the consciousness of the population. He thus vilif ies, moralizingly  and unexpectedly misogynistically, the hypnosis so valued by Bekhterev  in therapy by calling it an infamous trick from the arsenal of the feature  f ilm and all other art forms that constrict consciousness. In the manifesto  Kinoglaz he writes of the f ilm drama: Stupefaction and suggestion – the art-drama’s basic means of influence  – relate to that of a religion and enable it for a time to maintain a man in  an excited unconscious state. We are familiar with examples of direct sug- gestion (hypnosis), with examples of sexual suggestion, when a woman in  exciting her husband or lover can suggest any thoughts or acts to him.14 Just as Bekhterev had drawn the public’s attention to the inf irmity of their  consciousness under neuro-physiological points of view in his Petersburg  lectures, Vertov also showed the audience how consciousness can be de- ceived in the cinema, and self-awareness can also be disappointed. Vertov’s  f ilms, above all Man with a Movie Camera, present cinematography as a  technology in all its manipulative possibilities in order then to raise aware- ness of the “magic” of everyday life. Only consciousness can f ight the sway of magic in all its forms. Only consciousness can form a man of f irm opinion, f irm conviction. We need conscious men, not an unconscious mass submissive to any  passing suggestion. Long live the class consciousness of the healthy with eyes and ears to  see and hear with! Away with the fragrant veil of kisses, murders, doves, and slight-of-hand! Long live the class vision! Long live kino-eye!15 Both f igures, Bekhterev and Vertov, battle with the paradox of recognizing  media technologies as not enabling conscious choices, but as having to  use it nonetheless to fulf ill their mission to enlighten. What is common to  both is the attempt to make consciousness itself to appear as foreign and  different by means of the outside of the apparatus, and thus to be able to  judge oneself as different. This is also why the title Celovek s kinoapparatom  should be translated quite literally not as Cameraman nor as Man with a  Movie Camera, but more exactly as Person through the Cinematic Apparatus,  </page> <page sequence="9"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 255 who then turns up as a kind of causa formalis. What is shown is the person  produced according to objective psychology through the cinematic ap- paratus in his or her objective truth. The paradox of wanting to produce a self-awareness from unconscious, that  is, by means of film tricks or hypnosis not accessible due to the technical bases  of conscious perception, from which a “man of firm opinion, firm conviction”  can be formed, persists at any rate as an ambiguity of technical suggestion and  enchantment. Over and over again, the montage sequences of the Kinoki films  intoxicatingly circle around the topic of ecstasy, of shamanistic practices, of  stirring rhythm, of madness, and of the dance, like around the blind spot  of their own theory. An example is the beginning of the f irst Kinoglaz f ilm:  One sequence is called “Kino-Eye, At the Church Holiday, “or”, The Effect of  Homemade Vodka on the Village Women”, and all the opium of the masses  is vilif ied in images of women dancing madly. Until it becomes clear that,  for the spectator, the village women’s frenzy is solely due to the frenzy of the  editing and thus to the cinema as a Platonic opium den. The succession of the  f irst 58 short shots shows that they are enhanced by a pattern of constantly  accelerating repetitions into a rhythmic crescendo of their own.16 What the art drama is meant to display as religious madness, “stupefac- tion and suggestion”, is here conducted by the anti-drug agitation itself  by means of the technology of cinema. The women’s stupefaction, which  is announced in the caption as an example of misdirected ecstasy, has  too much momentum for an anti-alcohol campaign – or, as it is called in  more technical terms in the Kinoki manifestos, “rhythm of movement,  slowed and accelerated” – indeed, precisely that momentum that, from  so-called gypsy music to the music of Kusturica’s mad Balkanites, has time  and again been considered corrupting by orderly states and has thus been  banned. Just as the limbs of marionettes sway logorhythmically to the  mental lines of dancers, bottles sway in the hands of intoxicated female  dancers, and their bodies in turn sway logarhythmically to the gazes that  go into the camera-eye, constant and unflinchingly direct, like a steadfast  axis. The vilif ication of the dancing women turns into a sermon straight  from the mouth of a preacher that is itself intoxicated and intoxicating: the  cinematic apparatus. The question is whether, with so much movement and  excitement, for agitation is nothing other than that, it is ultimately only  rhythmic interference patterns that arise in the spectator’s perception in  place of a healthy class consciousness, and whether it is even possible to  speak of objectively analyzing reality anymore. In fact, the goal of analyzing  reality seems to have yielded once and for all to synthesis. In the Provisional  Instructions to Kino-Eye Groups from 1926 we read: </page> <page sequence="10"> 256 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  I can point to the dancing of the drunken peasant women in the f irst  section of Kinoglaz as an example of a montage moment not limited by  time and space. They were f ilmed at different times, in different villages,  and edited together into a single whole. The beer house and the market,  actually all the rest[...] were also done through montage.17 The truth of reality can therefore be experienced less by consciously re- producing events than by exposing the recording and editing techniques,  that is, the conditio humana in the age of its f ilm reproducibility.18 And  here it is not only about presenting the bare functionality of the device,  but about the effects of its functioning, the way that it conceals connec- tions or brings them to the light of sense. The condition of this awareness,  however, is that the agitating attraction, the “Verblüffen” [“mystif ications”],  as Sophie Küppers described it, is followed by an external view of one’s  own perception. The class morale of the sequence is meant to disappear  behind the question of “seeing class”, which means that the circumstances  that relativize all perception are brought to the screen in their interfer- ences. That these functionalities produce new technical intoxications is  something that Dziga Vertov the enlightener would not wish to deny, Dziga  Vertov the director would be delighted, and Dziga Vertov the cultural  revolutionary would have known it already anyway. It was presumably not  a transcendental human being that Vertov wanted to bring to life, but one  that could enter into a new relationship to itself and the world by means  of the new technologies. At the Psychoneurological Institute Vertov had  been interested in “apparatus medicine” as a contemporary technology of  neurologists. For him the essence of reality cannot be separated from the  essence of the technology that places it into a constellation, thus creating  it in the f irst place. Vertov did not assume, just as Bekhterev had not, that there was such a  thing as a stable, identical self-consciousness from which knowledge could  be set. The truth is that human beings are in constant exchange with the  molecular movements of their surroundings, which carry them along in  the form of symphonies or drinking women. Spectators are supposed to  learn not with their own eyes, but with kino-eyes, and thus also learn to see  themselves. They themselves can therefore be physiologically intoxicated  before they learn how the circumstances are constructed from the relations  of montage. For Vertov this is no support for conventional objectivity, but  is a violent split from an imagined subjectivity. In “Kinoki – A Revolution”  from 1923 the kino-eye, speaking in the f irst person again, explains how  the spectator’s attention is guided through space and time. </page> <page sequence="11"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 257 I make the viewer see in the manner best suited to my presentation of  this or that visual phenomenon. The eye submits to the will of the camera  and is directed by it to those successive points of the action that, most  succinctly and vividly, bring the f ilm phrase to the height or depth of  resolution. Example; shooting a boxing match, not from the point of view of a specta- tor present, but shooting the successive movements (the blows) of the  contenders. Example: the f ilming of a group of dancers, not from the point of view of a  spectator sitting in the auditorium with a ballet on the stage before him. After all, the spectator at a ballet follows, in confusion, now the combined  group of dancers, now random individual f igures, now someone’s legs – a  series of scattered perceptions, different for each spectator. One can’t present this to the f ilm viewer. A system of successive move- ments requires the f ilming of dancers or boxers in the order of their  actions, one after another... by forceful transfer of the viewer’s eye to the  successive details that must be seen. The camera ‘carries’ the f ilm viewer’s eyes from arms to legs, from legs  to eyes and so on, in the most advantageous sequence, and organizes the  details into an orderly montage study.19 This montage study is not so much for editors as it is for spectator brains,  which themselves are brought to dance. “For the f irst time, we feel that the  obvious drawback of such a film screening can be found not on-screen but in  the theater”, was Rudolf Arnheim’s attempt in 1929 to explain this odd state  in Vertov’s cinema.20 The regularity of this exercise is one in which percep- tion is imposed as something from outside, as a rule of movement-intervals,  a synthetic manipulation of the brain. The kinoks manifesto continues:  “The result of this concerted action of the liberated and perfected camera  and the strategic brain of man directing, observing, and gauging – the  presentation of even the most ordinary things will take on an exceptionally  fresh and interesting aspect.”21 The attempt to wire up apparatus and brain  and therefore to use f ilm tricks to get around consciousness, since it is  moving on the familiar pathways of experience, was still an experiment  for the kinoks themselves in 1923, and its outcome could only vaguely be  prognosticated as “fresh and interesting.” Many years later Rudolf Arnheim, who himself had done his doctorate  in Gestalt psychology on physiognomy and the problem of expression  and its interpretation, could not make rhyme or reason out of the lack  of any meaning on screen.22 Vertov’s f irst sound f ilm, which bears the  </page> <page sequence="12"> 258 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  title Enthusiasm, which is signif icant for the ecstasy complex, was heav- ily criticized by Arnheim in the “Weltbühne” on September 29, 1931. It is  not by chance that Kleist’s formulation of marionette movements, “fairly  artif icial”, is brought into the mix, and he is annoyed by the “flickering”,  which Münsterberg would have been particularly pleased about: “Montage  alone is supposed to provide the f ilm’s structure, and this quite artif icial,  theoretically thought-out restriction results in an editing overload – a  flickering of images, held only loosely together, which strongly taxes the  viewer’s nerves.”23 Using the puzzling formulation that the f ilm Enthusiasm  remains an “unmodified structure”, perhaps Arnheim wished to aid Vertov’s  intention to assert its rights of not making reality available randomly, but  to construct an optics in which reality becomes viewable in its various  patterns. For Arnheim, however, all this was glowing splinters that showed  the nerves all that remained as movement: an attitude toward life, the  good “vibrations” of the Soviets, which Arnheim was justif iably calling  into question in 1931. But in doing so the documentary quality of the kinoks  operation was obscured. Vectors and power relations, movements and the  method of results seemed only to be empty claims before a party hierarchy  that had solidif ied into a block of matter. This caused what was new in  Vertov’s discovery, that the nerves could be moved without implying any  statement or contents, to disappear behind the critical mistrust that he was  trying to arouse enthusiasm for a corrupt system. In 1931 Soviet art was no  longer the great hope it had once been. At the same time, Vertov’s aesthetic theory and practice, which he had  essentially formulated at the beginning of the twenties, was still, or rather  once again, far ahead of his contemporaries. The camera-eye shows a truth  that also holds outside the cinema, namely that the human eye is disengaged  from the position of power and control that the Renaissance was able to  promise the bourgeois individual with its optical tricks. What is deceived in  this case is a psychology that, despite all experimental research, holds onto  the biographical concept of a coherent individual with a soul, and draws its  conclusions from the introspective method. It is this subjective psychology  from which Vertov also distances himself, as a result of his years of study- ing and experimenting at Bekhterev’s Psychoneurological Institute. In the  text “We: Variant of a Manifesto” from 1922 he writes: “The ‘psychological’  prevents man from being as precise as a stopwatch; it interferes with his  desire for kinship with the machine.”24 In 1931 Arnheim was not the only one  who refused to dignify the sensory-motor movements that Vertov’s f ilms  spin and cast as collective, intersubjective, and metasubjective as a positive  and productive step. “Vertov does away very radically with everything that  </page> <page sequence="13"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 259 is individual – even with the human individual.”25 He sees Vertov’s demand  for kinship with the machine as above all a kind of technology fetishism, as  the critic Lenoble had attested fairly paradigmatically as Vertov’s psycho- ideology already in 1929: “Vertov’s work comes very close to the perception  of the world and the outlook on the world of the technical intelligentsia,  who are characterized by precisely the anti-psychological and technical  approach.”26 An “anarcho-indiviualist”27 who seeks to merge, not with power but in the  new circumstances of time, space, matter, and movement, however, cannot  balk at harmonizing the human mind with matter and its physical laws. It is  the prerequisite for f ilm epistemology, the “documentary cinematic decod- ing of both the visible world and that which is invisible to the naked eye”,28  as he put it in the article “Kino-Eye to Radio-Eye”. Vertov follows Bekhterev’s  principle that science “does not consist in exploring the essence of things  themselves, but is aimed at pursuing the reciprocal relationships between  appearances.”29 In Bekhterev’s tradition, he had laid the foundations for a  new understanding of the medial unconscious, which, at least in western  f ilm criticism, had not been pursued further. The relationship between the  “conscious” and the “unconscious” in f ilm operations is not only contested  in Vertov, it is one of the most common causes for bewilderment in f ilm  theory. Vertov and his kinoks practice is only one fundamental example  of f ilm as a technology and f ilm as a describable complex of signif ication  coming into contradiction and conflict. But the debates in f ilm studies  about intoxication and enlightenment in what is called “Russian cinema”,  which will repeat more or less similarly for the American f ilm avant-garde  of the forties, show that the most developed critics went mad due to the  distinction between the medial consciousness and the media unconscious  precisely because cinema works beyond conscious perception. The open questions begin with what depiction means in the f irst place.  Siegfried Kracauer, for instance, after he had seen Man with a Movie Camera,  clearly before its German premiere, wrote in the Frankfurter Zeitung on  May 19, 1929: All is movement, a single powerful movement that encompasses the  heretofore fragmented aspects, and all the elements [...] flow together  and fuse so completely with each other that they enter into the rhythm  of the whole.[...] There are, therefore, two principal actors in the f ilm: the  ensemble of things and people in the city, and the “man with a movie  camera” who takes control of them all. The material world on the one  hand, and on the other, the “cinema-eye.” The relationships between them  </page> <page sequence="14"> 260 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  determine the content of the f ilm. The results are utterly remarkable; in  any case, the cameraman presents anything but mere copies of objects.30 By describing Man with a Movie Camera as a f ilm made up of movements  and relationships, Kracauer very precisely described Vertov’s procedure. In  this f irst review Kracauer shows himself to be enthused, elevating Vertov’s  procedure above even that of Walter Ruttman in Berlin: Symphony of a Great  City: “While Ruttman’s associative linkages, however, are purely formal  throughout[...] Vertov uses montage to extract a meaning from the connec- tions between the fragments of reality.”31 Once again, credit is given to sense.  Kracauer, who would afterwards write his “psychological history of German  f ilm” in the tradition of a sociology founded in ideology critique, did not  wish to have the psychological, social, and thus also political implications  of the sense-less kinoks method overlooked, perceived, or disavowed. Over  the course of time Kracauer’s initial enthusiasm waned. By the time of his  book From Caligari to Hitler, which he wrote in New York, Vertov is merely  mentioned as a propagandist: Vertov, infatuated with every expression of real life, produced weekly  newsreels of a special kind from the close of the Civil War on, and in  about 1926 began to make feature-length f ilms which still preserved a  def inite newsreel character.[...] Like Ruttmann, he is interested not in  divulging news items, but in composing ‘optical music.’32 Looking back, Kracauer is very reserved in his evaluation of Vertov. What  he once considered enlightening now seemed to him as purely formal  questions. In 1929 Vertov’s discovery of circumstances by cinematographic  means had still been illuminating: “Vertov interprets (the juxtaposition)  through his presentation.”33 In the course of his writings in exile, in the  course of the political developments of the forties, Kracauer’s sympathetic  understanding disappears. Kracauer’s own critical theory posed the ques- tion of technology as only secondary. What he sought to explain in his  analyses, namely “those deep layers of collective mentality which extend  more or less below the dimension of consciousness,34” has nothing to do  with what Vertov, in the tradition of the ref lexologists, was presenting  in the cinema as the unconscious mechanisms of human perception and  making visible by reflecting on technology. Kracauer’s examination of the  unconscious in the cinema also does not require any technical precision in  the apparatuses that was demanded by the objective psychologists in their  experiments on the nervous system, and that the kinoks realized in their  </page> <page sequence="15"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 261 experiments in cinema. In the US, Kracauer only mentions Vertov and the  montage of the kinoks at all in a comparison with Ruttmann, as if his initial  enthusiasm now only seemed to him to be an error and an infatuation at  the urging of the communists: “Vertov’s continued survey of everyday life  rests upon his unqualif ied acceptance of Soviet actuality.”35 In 1947, however, in the middle of the discussion in New York about  surrealism, avant-garde f ilm, and the techniques of political propaganda,  a critical examination by Siegfried Kracauer would surely have resulted in  Vertov, who at the time was once again working under miserable conditions  in Moscow for the weekly newsreels, being discovered as a precursor to a  f ilm practice that critically put the effect of the media itself to the test. Of  course, immediately following the war propaganda that had precisely been  so much about media in its planning, this topic would have been highly risky  and awkward for an asylum seeker. Kracauer, however, never examined  f ilm technologies in relation to – and possibly as in contradistinction to –  political topics, neither then nor later. Ideology critique was not supposed  to be concerned with neuronal manipulations and flicker analysis, but with  the part of the cinematic that was capable of making conscious choices.  Nonetheless, as early as 1948 Kracauer displayed a fascination similar to the  one he had once shown for Vertov when discussing the f ilms of Maya Deren,  who was interested in just those aspects of the cinema that could manipu- late psychology and perception. Here as well, he qualif ies his enthusiasm  with the words “the problem is only what the meaning itself amounts to.”36  Deren’s idea of the unconscious and here critique of psychoanalysis might  also have helped him – or seduced him – to f ind a new way to approach  the unconscious in and through cinema. But he remained steadfast. As he  had already done with Vertov, he refused to view the media process itself  as social or even political practice. For this reason, Kracauer has always  been considered a steadfast antipode to all media theory, and not only in  American f ilm theory.37 Explosions Walter Benjamin, who was a Russia traveler for love, tried to make the  phenomenon of the cinema understandable to the bookish set. In the f irst  version of his work of art essay in 1935, Benjamin attempted, albeit without  mentioning Vertov, the Kinoglaz f ilms, or Chelovek s kinoapparatom, to  negotiate between human and apparatus, between subjective and objective  psychology, and between the the function of media and that of aesthetics.38  </page> <page sequence="16"> 262 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  Like Kracauer, he also takes issue with the distinction between conscious  and unconscious, but whereas Kracauer restricts himself to a “more or less  below”, Benjamin let the space of conscious and unconscious structures  get permeated, almost in a kind of cubistic manner. The human being  is – according to Benjamin in his preliminary work on a media theory,  which he would only work out in its various successor texts – not called  into question by the apparatus, but can extend his or her knowledge of the  ego, of the self, by means of the new technological apparatus. The example  that he uses for the optical unconscious is directly comparable to Vertov’s  f ilm jump. (And the reflexive “self” used by the later Frankfurt School social  researchers is seen to be something more than the storing and collecting  rear guard of the ego-function.): The most important social function of film is to establish equilibrium be- tween human beings and the apparatus. Film achieves this goal not only in  terms of man’s presentation of himself to the camera but also in terms of  his representation of his environment by means of this apparatus.[...]With  the close-up, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended.[...]  Clearly it is another nature which speaks to the camera as compared to  the eye. “Other” above all in the sense that a space informed by human  consciousness gives way to a space informed by the unconscious. Whereas  it is a commonplace that, for example, we have some idea what is involved  in the act of walking (if only in general terms), we have no idea at all  what happens during the split second when a person actually takes a  step.[...] This is where the camera comes into play, with all its resources for  swooping and rising, disrupting and isolating, stretching or compressing  a sequence, enlarging or reducing an object. It is through the camera  that we f irst discover the optical unconscious, just as we discover the  instinctual unconscious through psychoanalysis.39 It should be noted that in the second version of the essay, which Benja- min only f inished after the start of the war in December 1939, there is a  harsher syntax used to subject the human being as a subject to f ilm. The  corresponding section XIII about f ilm and apparatus now begins with the  formulation: Film can be characterized not only in terms of man’s presentation of  himself to the camera but also in terms of his representation of his envi- ronment by means of this apparatus. A glance at occupational psychology  illustrates the testing capacity of the equipment.[...] A similar deepening  </page> <page sequence="17"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 263 of apperception throughout the entire spectrum of optical – and now  auditory – impressions has been accomplished by f ilm.40 The bookish soul cannot get back to the world of its own bookish sensation.  The apparatuses have yanked apperception into depths from which it can  only come back to its senses with the help of science and psychoanalysis. The  following passage from the second version of the Work of Art essay justif ies,  quite differently from the first, above all the objectivity of f ilm as a scientific  instrument and, in parallel, the scientif ic quality of psychoanalysis as an  objective system of storing traces. On the one hand this lends more weight  to technology. “Demonstrating that the artistic uses of photography are  identical to its scientific uses – these two dimensions having usually been  separated until now – will be one of the revolutionary functions of film.”41 On  the other hand, in this second version the possibilities of f ilm is pointedly  placed in light of a disillusionment with the emancipatory power of art.  The enthusiastic experiences that Benjamin had described with the Rus- sian, Nordic, and American cinema as avant-garde in anti-fascist art must  have softened the insight that fascist artists knew how to use f ilm just as  well. Although he himself never wrote any further f ilm criticism, and in  particular despite never taking account of Vertov’s intentions, Benjamin  had nonetheless laid the foundations of a media critique that had taken up  a different “unconscious” than the individual-psychological one had been.  The “unconsciously affected space” that is screened in the cinema with  slow motion, time lapse, close-ups, fades, and cuts initially transcends the  known and conscious human in this technological sense. Benjamin’s most famous formulation, however, is found in both the 1935  and the 1939 versions: “Hopeless” is how Benjamin describes the familiar and  common spaces, the bars, railroad stations, streets, off ices, and factories  that enclose human beings. “Then came film and exploded this prison-world  with the dynamite of the split second, so that now we can set off calmly  on journeys of adventure among its far-flung debris.”42 In this sentence he  formulates the simultaneity of liberation and horror that affects anyone  who allows the intervention of f ilm into the basic structure of perception  to become a conscious experience. In Benjamin’s formulation of calmly  move through the wreckage of the world we might already see one source  of McLuhan’s thesis that media might have anaesthetizing effects. At any  rate, Benjamin’s analogy is about an exploding out of habit and certainty  by the ego-feeling and its sensations, which had been raised by the new  technology in its origins. This is why cinema is also always a confrontation  with the fragments and the fragmentary in the world, even if involuntary  </page> <page sequence="18"> 264 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  brain functions and imaginary energy force the split seconds into artif icial  contexts. Writing about the explosive force of f ilm, Benjamin provides a significant  objection to that theory that sees cinema as a form of the Platonic cave, in  which spectators feel suspended due to the structural “sous-motricité” and  “sur-perception” in the movie seat, because in this mimicry of those bound  in Plato’s cave the reminiscence of the blissful imaginary experience of the  small child is actualized, the experiences of corporal unity are granted  in the optical-visual realm, while every real experience and especially  the violent breakthrough to reality is displaced by imaginary baggage.43  For Benjamin, on the other hand, precise perception under cinematic  circumstances signif ies the expulsion from the familiar as a chance to  discover the relations between consciousness and technology, between  the unconscious and the technical basis for how it works. In contrast to  later f ilm theorists, Benjamin saw this attack on identity and the process  of identif ication in the cinema spectator not only as disturbance, but also  as a necessary, fragmenting analysis, which releases from the familiar  and common educational processes of the subject.44 Frighteningly, we  can assert in the cinema that every identif ication has a technological and  perception-psychological prelude, and that not only works of art, but also  identities fundamentally change with forms of media depiction in the  passage of time. But Benjamin cannot maintain the confidence of this statement in the  second version of his text. Under the impositions of history he had lost hope  that f ilm might establish “equilibrium between human beings and the  apparatus”, this “equilibrium” that became the shibboleth of the anarchs  among the cyberneticists, who still dreamed of a scientif ic and artistic  extension and connection of human organisms with the world. Intervals Vertov’s montage theory of intervals is the production of relations between  the smallest common units of the appearances of matter by the cinematic  medium. While the debate about the alternative between music and math- ematics has so far concerned Vertov’s interval theory,45 here a physical  option will be brought to play as well. Vertov’s intervals have a strong aff in- ity to the Lebesque integral, which revolutionized pre-war mathematics as  much as Einstein’s theories of physics had – and which, in 1919 (when Vertov  wrote the f irst version of his interval theory), led a young mathematician  </page> <page sequence="19"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 265 daydreaming at the window at MIT to want to calculate the surface of  the River Charles in its movements. The theory of the Lesbesque integral  allows for calculating irregularly moving points on surfaces and bodies by  combing the sequence of intervals.46 One signif icant requirement among  others for cybernetically determined prognoses: technology offered a view  to the future that could be seen, computed from the relations, interferences,  and sequencing of events in the past, in a surprisingly new quality: “shins  vrasploch.” It is only in this context that intervals not only describe and signify  circumstances, but can become operators of a changeable world. The mov- ing art of the cinema in meant to take apart the world into intervals, not  in physiological movements, but in substructures of units of physical  movement and their transitions. Vertov describes the transition from  cinematography to edited f ilm as a relation of intervals: “Intervals (the  transitions from one movement to another) are the material, the elements  of the art of movement, and by no means the movements themselves. It is  they (the intervals) which draw the movement to a kinetic resolution.”47 Unlike Eisenstein’s later interval montage, Vertov wanted to edit the  elements of the world as the camera records them as unmoved elements of  motion, and as the projector again turns them into moved images. Vertov  proposed a montage of illustrations as derivations in the mathematical  sense of movement. The relations of movements on the screen is meant  to replace the systematic gap between the cinematic image and the f ilm  signal. Vertov’s procedure is a non-hierarchical montage, which initiates  equal and reciprocal relations between the most heterogeneous elements. It  does without any “dominant”, like the one Sergei Eisenstein wants and must  maintain for his overtonal montage in f ilm. So, as Vertov breaks, but does  not interrupt the intoxication of perception by reflecting on manipulating  this perception through technology, he takes up the law of movements  and follows it without letting it interrupt its path through the borders of  anthropomorphic shapes. This movement of movement is an exact continuation of the principle of  transferal, which Bekhterev had examined for world energy. It was taken up  again, much later, by Gilles Deleuze in his f irst cinema book The Movement  Image, in which he initially gives an account of Henri Bergson’s reflections  on movement from Matière et mémoire: “Our error lies in believing that it is  any-element-whatevers, external to qualities that moves. But the qualities  themselves are pure vibrations which change at the same time as the alleged  elements move.”48 Already in Bergson’s book from 1896 there is the idea  of a movement that is realized through bodies and identities. In light of  </page> <page sequence="20"> 266 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  this tradition Deleuze examines the structures of perception in Vertov’s  f ilms, the relations of movement as interrelations and intervals of material  perception itself: In Vertov the interval of movement is perception, the glance, the eye. But  the eye is not the too-immobile human eye; it is the eye of the camera, as  it extends from a point where an action begins to the limit of the reaction,  as it f ills the interval between the two, crossing the universe and beating  in time to its intervals.49 The eye of matter thus functions like human vision in the cinema. It syn- thesizes impulses and connects action and reaction to a material reflex  arc, albeit one that transcends the boundaries of the individual. If Deleuze  distinguishes between camera-eye and human-eye in his description, then  he only does so to mark the break at which human perception can become  material, just as it had been imagined in reflexology. It is not the human  eye, but the human gaze that can f ind itself cinematically interrelating to  the world. At any rate, it gets lost, itself tossed about back and forth by the  reciprocally affecting light and reflection punctures of the matter, so that  there is no center any longer in which the old human being could maintain  his position. It is only the multiple ways and movements of actions and  reactions that become a recognizable model of a world in which everything  possible can be conveyed. This would also be a correct description of the  social circumstances in the relational logic of Bekhterevian collective  reflexology.50 Deleuze therefore points precisely to the sticks of Benjaminian dynamite  in cinema, showing which f ilms consciously dismiss an old view of the  human being and which scientists and artists from the beginning of the  twentieth century had already distanced themselves from the anthropology  of the nineteenth century – which was often simply science in the service of  colonial and imperial power. The new structure and communication of mat- ter, which had made visible a “truth by means of f ilm”, realized movements  and connection beyond the shapes and boundaries of individual bodies: We have seen that the gap, the interval between two movements sketches  out an empty place which pref igures the human subject in so far as he  appropriates perception to himself. But, for Vertov, the most important  thing was to restore the intervals to matter. This is the meaning of mon- tage, and of the ‘theory of intervals,’ which is more profound than that  of movement. The interval is no longer that which separates a reaction  </page> <page sequence="21"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 267 from the action experienced, but, on the contrary, that which – an action  being given in a point of the universe – will f ind the appropriate reaction  in some other point [point quelconque], however distant it is.51 This explains why Vertov, with his concept of universal and reciprocal  matter-connections, of universal reflex-arcs, should be treated as a political  outsider in the new Soviet state, which was then in the process of making  the heterogeneous homogenous and hierarchical. But the interval theory  is even more radical than what the f ilm agencies understood by it. In the  context of interval theory, Vertov’s temporary exclusion of “man as a subject  for f ilm” because of “his inability to control his movements”52 is no mere  anti-humanism.53 It once again refers to an unconscious that has noth- ing to do with suppressed fantasies, but with the unconscious movement  of perception and of desire – in the technology of the cinema and in the  structure of the gaze, permeated with desire. This is why Vertov embraces  the non-human as liberating from an oppressive, desireless human reality.  This is also a lesson from Bekhterev’s arsenal, which butted up against all  acceptable conventions with its view of being good citizens with Collective  Reflexology.54 Vertov wanted to liberate the cinema from its anthropomor- phism, constituted from the symbolic remains of the culture of writing, in  order f inally to let the dancer merge with the dance. If even he speaks of a  “new man” who “will have the light, precise movements of machines, and ...  will be the gratifying subject of our films.”55 Vertovs concept makes a distinc- tion from the new man demanded by socialism. The model of this new man  is Dziga Vertov, as artif icial as the name referring to the man jumping from  the heights. Instead of a hero, cinema shows someone hesitating, balking,  wavering.56 According to this model, the analysis-apparatus ‘cinema’ was an  anti-heroic model, proposed as a universal transformation machine, just as  the personality had also been conceived by Bekhterev as a transformation  machine for global energy. From this perspective Deleuze defended the  Vertovian truth of matter against the reproach of anti-humanism: ...each – even the most charming peasant woman or the most touching  child – was presented as a material system in perpetual interaction. They  were catalysts, converters, transformers, which received and re-emitted  movements, whose speed, direction, order, they changed, making matter  evolve towards less ‘probable’ states, bringing about changes out of all  proportion to their own dimensions. It is not that Vertov considered  beings to be machines, but rather machines which had a ‘heart’ and which  ‘revolved, trembled, jolted about and threw out f lashes of lightning,’ as  </page> <page sequence="22"> 268 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  man could also do, using other movements and other conditions, but  always in interaction with each other.57 What the “life caught unawares” – the declared goal of the cinematic organi- zation of the world in the Provisional Instructions to Kino-Eye Groups from  1926 – conveys in the facial expression and gestures of the physiological  analysis to the cinema-lab worker corresponds to the truth of objective  psychology. This is why Vertov so disdained the cinema under the direction  of bourgeois psychology: “We consider the psychological Russo-German  film-drama – weighed down with apparitions and childhood memories – an  absurdity.”58 It does not observe with analytical apparatuses, kino-eyes, but  f ilms what had been written, dramatized according to the logic of literary  souls. It remains the cinematic illustration of a Bildungsroman. Vertov’s rage  at f iction f ilms can also be explained by the fact that in 1935 writing and  text were still an unavoidable reference medium for f ilm artists, and served  as the basis for distributing production funds or imposing censorship. Only  previously written-down observations were permitted, after approval, to  be f ilmed. Any direct recording with the camera, however, was forbidden,  since the bureaucracy of the time had no censorship laws for celluloid. The  journal writer Vertov writes about the director Vertov: “To observe – all of  Pavlov’s students are allowed to do it, even all scholars and writers, but  he is not allowed. To him they say he has to write everything down in the  script, the script is the primary thing.”59 Experiences Chelovek s kinoapparatom, proclaimed a “f ilm without intertitles”, does  not, however, manage to get by completely without some sort of written  notice to the audience. But it is also possible that it was not permitted  to appear without titles. The spectator’s attention is discretely drawn to  her position as a test subject, as is always the case in the cinema. Later  this is experienced with the spectator’s own body. In the opening credits  The Man with a Movie Camera is called a “f ilm experiment”, Dziga Vertov  is introduced as the “author-supervisor of the experiment”, the goal of  the experiment is “the cinematic transmission of visual phenomena” and  indeed exclusively by means of cinema. The announcement continues its  offensive not only against the competing arts, but against f ilms that this  one is indebted to. </page> <page sequence="23"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 269 This f ilm is an experiment in cinematic communication of real events Without the help of intertitles (a f ilm with no intertitles) Without the help of a story (a f ilm with no story) Without the help of theater (a f ilm with neither actors nor sets) This experimental work aims at creating a truly international language  of cinema based on its absolute separation from the language of theater  and literature.60 After the other f ilm technicians have been introduced, there are in fact  no more intertitles for the next 92 minutes. The reciprocal relationship  between the images and the flickering, which now begin, are less anarchic  than Deleuze’s description would have them be. In one of the first sequences  the projector is introduced in the f ilm, and the sequence is edited with  other shots into a motif of beginning. The f ilm seeks to f ind the moment  between motionlessness and the introduction of a movement, between  rest and restlessness in the gears and the masses of people. Finally, there is  a shot showing two carbon pencils concurring in the image, and the light  of the arc lamp starts to shine, starting up the projection. This montage  blends into moments of awakening, of rising, of the visual movement of  opening and of the optical opening of perspectives and gazes. The motifs  metaphorically repeat what the technology is realizing. Just as the principle of the interval is introduced into the montage, one  sequence shows – to put it into words after all – “traff ic, movement, and  seeing movement.” The cameraman presented in the f ilm throws himself  into the capital’s traff ic, and the “invisible”, f ilming camera follows him.  Already at the beginning of the sequence unconscious perceptions and  effects of cinema have appeared, effects which work beneath conscious  perception in correspondence to one another, so that human vision itself,  in a parallel to all the images, becomes the object of observation. A relativ- ity of seeing movement is gradually built up in the cinema. While at f irst  we only see simple movements in the image, these are then also taken  up by a moving vehicle so that two movements become relativized on  screen. Finally, the whole constellation itself is taken up in traveling, that  is, jolting, so that what is actually invisible, namely the camera that is  f ilming, becomes visible through its own movements. The brief cutaway  to the locomotive wheels introduces a new kind of movement: the tracks  that, in contrast to the carriage do not jolt, and thus also make it possible  </page> <page sequence="24"> 270 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  for the camera to travel without drawing attention to itself. To this day,  tracks allow for cameras to move unnoticed in the cinema as effects of the  spectator’s perception, as Münsterberg had described for artif icial atten- tion. In the last long wide shot the viewing of images gets entangled with  the past impressions of the different movements produced by f ilm. Every  movement that is seen becomes relative to all others and is at the same time  entangled with the new knowledge about how movements are produced. In  part this is a conscious reflection, in part it remains an unremarked shift  in perspective, which allows the spectator barely any conscious inferences  about his or her own seeing. Any f ixed spectatorial standpoint is dissolved  in what optically comes from the screen. The spectator’s gaze gets lost in  the chaotic movements of the traff ic. –  Close-up: Wheels of a locomotive slowing starting up (4”) –  Wide shot of the f ilming camera in motion, from behind the staged  cameraman, who turns the crank and records another carriage with  people in it riding in parallel (or simulates this for the footage) (5”) –  Close: the wheels of the locomotive in motion (6”) –  Wide shot from the f ilming camera to the staged cameraman, who is  f ilming the people in the carriage (4”) –  Medium shot: Train from below, that accelerates and drives away (3”) –  Medium shot: people in the carriage from the perspective of the staged  cameraman (3”) –  People from the perspective of a (second?) cameraman (5”) –  Medium shot of the staged cameraman on the carriage (6”) –  Medium shot to other people in carriages (6”) –  Close-up: the staged cameraman as he is shooting (2”) –  Close-up of two women in the carriage, one of them imitates the  cranking motion of the staged cameraman (2”) Already the thematizing of traff ic feeds back into the cinematic analysis  of movement and the synthetic, illusionary perception of movement. “The  essence of the cinematic movement-image lies in extracting from vehicles  or moving bodies the movement which is their common substance, or  extracting from movements the mobility which is their essence”,61 noted  Deleuze in a different context, but it shows how well armed the gaze is in  the cinema and how it can recognize itself as so armed. Over the course of the sequence the confusion of moving gazes is pushed  even further. If at f irst the two perspectives of the cameramen were built up  and differentiated, now they are intertwined, and the spectator’s gaze can  </page> <page sequence="25"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 271 no longer distinguish which camera-eye she is looking with or through. She  can only know that she is seeing cinema. This is the aim of montage: The  camera can assume any standpoint and simulate any gaze. It can take on  any gaze and anyone can apprehend the standpoint of the camera from the  screen. From the gesture of a passenger in the coach, however, who imitates  a cranking motion with his own head, the gaze of the – or of a – cameraman  becomes present on screen. In the movements of seeing the logic of the  gaze is now also interlaced as that of the other. Always and still “caught  unawares”, we are those who are being looked at in the traff ic of the world.  The f ilm plays out in the intervals of the movements and gazes. –  Medium shot of the staged cameraman on the carriage, the f ilming  camera lets him get closer. In the background the carriage with the  people –  Close-up of the people in the carriage, children, in the wind of the  ride (2”) –  Medium shot: the galloping carriage horse (3”) –  The staged cameraman on the carriage, cranking, driving in relation to  the the f ilming camera through the image, forward and backwards (2”) –  Medium shot: The galloping horse as above... after 3 seconds “frozen”  into a still picture (4”) In the unconscious navigation of gazes in the cinema, and in the un- conscious relation and reversal of human gazes in the street traff ic, the  unconscious deception of the senses then gets mixed in as a trick of the  cinema itself, namely the artif icial animation of spectator brains, which  see movement in still images. In the image of the galloping horse, which is  frozen on screen by a trick, the f ilm leads back to the primal scene of f ilm  in the experiment at Palo Alto. Once again, everything is maintained in the  staging of the cinema-eyes: illusion and disillusion. Frustrating the illusion  of movement in the cinema by showing a still image, from which motion  is created in the f irst place, is at the same time a double deception, for a  still image on the screen can only be generated by showing a succession of  identical images in the intermittent course of the projector. Any conscious- ness that tries to keep up with its own imaginative effects here will be lost.  Only someone who allows herself to be deceived can be enlightened by the  cinema-eye – about the fact that she herself is continually transformed  in every inevitable identif ication and – consciously – cannot see herself  seeing. The truth lies somewhere in between, around 20 times a second. </page> <page sequence="26"> 272 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  More still images follow, introducing us to the technology of the editing  room: –  Still: Medium shot of the people in the carriage (4”) –  Still: Wide shot of the avenue with passersby (3”) –  Still: Medium shot of two women in the carriage (4”) –  Still: Wide shot from above to a broad street, a market, or a large square  full of people and traff ic (4”) –  Still: Portrait of a woman with a pitiful expression –  Still of frames from a f ilmstrip, on which is depicted the portrait of a  young girl (5”) –  Still: tight close-up of a young woman looking sternly into the distance  (5”) –  Still of frames from a f ilmstrip, on which is depicted the portrait of a  different young girl (5”) –  Medium shot: strips in front of a light box, 17 f ilmstrips are sorted and  form patterns (5”) –  Shelves with sorted f ilm material (writing in Ukrainian) (21⁄2”) –  Close-up: the spool on an editing table, still (21⁄2”) –  Filmstrips, images of a girl, sideways, as they would be placed on the  editing table (21⁄2”) –  Close-up: the spool on the editing table, now turning and winding a  roll of f ilm onto it (21⁄2”) –  Medium shot, from the side, of an editor at the editing table, she is  cranking the machine (21⁄2”) –  Close-up: on the editing table above the light box runs a f ilmstrip  without intermittent equipment, that is, no picture can be seen, only  patterns that change with the speed.

Single images,  strips, the nearly invisible difference between the pictures in succession, the  various speeds on the editing table, the order of the f ilm strips, the editing  and the splicing make clear how much every depiction abstracts and has to  be made open to montage in the individual frames before it can be turned  into a moving form of reality in the cinema. What is demonstrated is that  no image can be seen if the f ilm runs continuously. The invisible intervals  are necessary for an image to emerge. What is also demonstrated is that  quite different images – as in the case of a cut – can be put together by the  </page> <page sequence="27"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 273 brain, like the almost identical images of a still photo: only the movement  pattern and the intervals have to be right. –  Medium shot, from the side the editor, Svilova, at the editing table,  tapes two f ilmstrips together (3”) –  Still: Portrait of a young girl (3”) –  Medium shot of the editor from below, in the background are the strips  in front of the light box, the editor is looking for a strip (3”) –  Sequence of the young girl, who we have just seen as a still, in full  motion: the girl starts to laugh (3”) –  Medium close-up, the editor at the editing table cranks and looks at  the strips (2”) –  Still: f ilm strip showing two boys in portrait (4”) –  Sequence of the two boys running in full motion (4”) –  Medium close-up, the editor at the editing table cranks and looks at  the strips (2”) –  Still of two other children as f ilmstrip (4”) –  Sequence of them in full motion (4”) –  Still of the portrait of the old woman who was already seen earlier (1”) –  Still: Wide shot of the large square that was seen earlier (1”) –  The two children just seen as a still, now in motion.

In this last part of the sequence the analysis of watching cinema becomes  an analysis of interpersonal perception, a psycho-analysis in the sense of  objective psychology. It goes back to Vertov’s origin, his jump. The still  images, like that of the old woman, the young woman, or the various chil- dren with their particular facial expressions, with their “somatic-mimic  reflexes”, are shown f irst so as to communicate these reflexes as emotion  and perception. As they get treated by f ilm technology this impression is  </page> <page sequence="28"> 274 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  frustrated, but also extended. If Bekhterev and Vertov had technologically  held and disassembled the complex reflexes and emotional movements of  expression in the early experiments, here they are presented as synthesis.  Once again the technical intervention is a treatment of what the naked  eye cannot see. The pitiable facial expressions of the old woman become,  in motion, those of a haggling market woman, but the other way around,  in the image of the unpleasant old woman there still exists what once had  aroused pity. Likewise, after being re-animated by movement, the young  woman, who seems dismissive in the still photo portrait, starts to speak and  to flirt with the camera, while all the earlier and contradictory components  of her expression are still maintained in this new movement. The children  continue changing their facial expressions, but the in the still photos one  could see that their exuberance also contained fear, surprise, amazement,  or timidity. The f ilm in the cinema is always simultaneously an analyzing and syn- thesizing movement of a reality. It is never about how something would  be, but about how it can be brought into a reflexive and reversible motion  so that new relations are produced and the unknown in the world can be  recognized. The kinoki had realized what Bekhterev had promised from  reflexology: “The ultimate goal of psychoreflexology is thus to study the  relation of the organism to the outside world in connection with existing  experience, quite independently of subjective experiences that one might  presume in the organism with external effects according to the analogy  with oneself.”62 Centers or centrifuges Somewhat puzzlingly, it is Vertov, with his montage theory, who is seen  as an agitator in western, and in particular German f ilm criticism.63  In a constant confusion of messenger and message, the demonstration  how power structures the gaze is taken for a power ploy itself. This is  exactly why Vertov explicitly replaced the subjective human eye, whose  logic cannot be seen objectively, with the mechanical kino-eye, whose  movements in the cinema can be traced and whose traces can be ensured.  This operation will be denounced as dogmatism in his successors, for  instance Godard, who invoked Vertov in his own work.64 The corrosive  and calculating Vertov is constantly opposed to the dialectical, musical  Sergei Eisenstein, whose work focuses on the human being as a hero f igure  corrected by historical materialism. </page> <page sequence="29"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 275 Eisenstein, on his search for a scientif ically grounded effect aesthetics  of f ilm, had also thoroughly studied the works of the reflexologists and  in particular of Bekhterev, as well as the writings of the most important  psychological schools.65 In 1924 Eisenstein defended his theater theses on  the Montage of Attractions, which had appeared in 1923 in the same publica- tion of the LEF – “Levy Front Iskusstv” – as Vertov’s manifesto Kino-Eye, and  adapted it for the cinema. At the time Eisenstein held reflexology in high  esteem: “The method of agitation through spectacle consists in the creation  of a new chain of conditioned reflexes by associating selected phenomena  with the unconditional ref lexes they produce.”66 While Bekhterev had  sought to show how observing and analyzing using technology leads to  different results in psychology than the subjective conclusions of analogy  do, and thus had used, among other things, snapshots in order to correct  subjective, pseudo-analogous, introspective psychology, Eisenstein orients  himself to Theodor Lipps’s thesis that emotional experiences can be had and  conveyed directly by the psyche, for instance “the emotional understand- ing of the alter ego through the imitation of the other.”67 Furthermore,  Eisenstein invokes Hermann Nothnagel’s physiological examinations of the  brain, which had showed that different nerve tracts are used for imitation  depending on whether the stimulus is voluntary or involuntary.68 Only  stimulation by affects reaches the thalamus in the brain directly, main- tained Eisenstein, and this direct path to the brain of his spectators was the  only thing that interested him. Later he turned, unlike Vertov, to classical  psychology and psychoanalysis in order f inally to orient himself to Piaget’s  theory, which he knew from Lev Vigotsky.69 For Eisenstein montage was  not about psychological traditions, but simply about eff icient dramaturgy.  “Reforging someone else’s psyche is no less diff icult and considerable a task  than forging iron.”70 Although Eisenstein’s experiments were no less inventive than Vertov’s,  their f ilm methods are completely different. Eisenstein was interested in  techniques that might change people, and he must have presumed that the  desired ideal, the goal of all education, which served as the basis for all artis- tic modelings, was already well established, for it is not what emerges in the  course of the f ilm process. The demand for the “model actor”, as he called  actors, was “the healthy organic rhythm of normal physical functions”,71 so  that the conveyance of feelings can run smoothly. It is hard to imagine two  goals of processing human feelings on f ilm being more different. Whereas  Vertov begins to disassemble the great and heroic feelings cinematically  and to cause the boundaries between normal and pathological to collapse  </page> <page sequence="30"> 276 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  in the multiplicity of elements and movements that establish a bodily state,  Eisenstein struggles with f ilm to create a healthy social body. For Eisenstein, f ilm serves to convey affects through facial expression  and gesture, not unlike in theater. The special technical aspects of the  cinema that store and synthesize reality in images is not of particular  concern to him. Movements interest him as the movement processes  of human bodies and not – here he is following Meyerhold and biome- chanics – as perceptual problems in the cinema. The cinematic method  corresponds to biomechanics because human movements, which by this  time had come under the inf luence of Taylorism, can be absorbed in  cinema as ergonomic – ref ined and systematized by analyzing working  processes historically and dialectically. Eisenstein relates all movements,  even the eccentric movements of a jazz musician, to a virtual center and  precisely to the “healthy organic rhythm of normal physical reactions.”  Film is not, as Vertov had proposed in his manifestos, an opportunity to  discover something new in the f ield of vision and to displace an “ego” and  its identity within familiar spatio-temporal conventions, but only one  among a variety of insuff icient methods to depict, to regulate, and f inally  to sort out the human historically. In 1929 Eisenstein ref ined his theory of montage according to the model  of the kabuki theater, which does not simply stimulate the various sense  organs with various impulses, but aims for “the f inal sum of stimulants  to the brain.”72 Correspondingly, in his article “The Fourth Dimension in  Cinema”, Eisenstein organizes his forms of montage into classes of impulses.  He names the more complex of them after musical structures: tonic and  dominant, major and minor, dissonance and consonance, without ever  explaining the transfer of these acoustic relations into f ilm technologies,  for instance into focal lengths, f ield sizes, or editing rhythms. He sticks  with illustrations using atmospheric images: so “major” is harvesting in  the sunshine, “minor” harvesting in rain or the port in fog, etc. Like in  acoustics, Eisenstein f inds overtones and undertones in f ilm as well, that  is, visual “aberrations, distortions, and other defects”73 that accompany a  f ilm sequence.74 He then understands the optical impulses illustrated in  musical metaphors as complex and reflex: That distinctive montage complex within the shot that arises from the  collisions and combinations of the individual stimulants inherent within  it, of stimulants that vary according to the ‘external nature’ but are bound  together in an iron unity through their reflex physiological essence.75 </page> <page sequence="31"> The TruTh won by means oF Film 277 This interpretation of reflexology assumes that nerves function in an analo- gous way to the physical qualities of the sense surroundings, meaning that,  to stick with Eisenstein’s examples, “a grey-haired old man, a grey-haired  old woman, a white horse, and a snow-covered roof”76 also exhibit constant  similarities in nerve physiology. But the particular possibilities of f ilm trans- mission, as Vertov had developed them from neurological research, precisely  do not consist in banging out parallel visual qualities in the sense organs – to  speak euphemistically, to use visual metaphors – but in activating brain func- tions through optical deception and in switching them on against viewing  habits. Another possibility might be to directly introduce an impulse to the  nerves through effects of movement and light in order to produce emotional  values. This would be the flickering, shimmering, and jittering in the cinema,  which transmits emotions that are neither coded nor decoded metaphorically,  and that expose the visual value, the motif, or the symbol in their various  possibilities of association or relation. Here it once again becomes clear why  Vertov insists that the cinema must f irst abandon producing images based  on the model of the human eye in order to experience its own traits and the  particular effects of the medium and its technology. When Eisenstein enumerates his four fundamental techniques of mon- tage as the metric, the rhythmic, the tonal, and the overtonal, he gets lost  in analogies. Poetry, music, and painting provide the terms for naming  f ilm techniques, but once again the parallels are only vague at best. The  precision of the meter “joins the ‘pulse-beat’ of the f ilm and the ‘pulse- beat’ of the audience ‘in unison.’ Without this there can be no ‘contact’  between the two.”77 But Eisenstein does not introduce f ilm montage as  electro-technologically as it is formulated here. For all his seemingly psycho- physiological ref inements, he always calculates the immediate effect on  the spectator, not the mediated one. Eisenstein’s example for overtonal montage is the “Gods” sequence in  his f ilm October. At the latest with this example, which is “assembled on a  descending intellectual scale” and shows “the notion of god back to a block  of wood”, it can be seen that the efforts to bring reflexology and psycho- physics into the f ield are completely unnecessary to explain Eisenstein’s  forms of montage, since it is precisely the “reaction of tissues” that require  impulses that are encoded as streams. Eisenstein sticks to divine metaphors.  His famous montage of the gods rhythmically places still photo depictions  of religious artworks in succession. The accelerating editing of the series is  conceived as a descending line, from the architectural example of a Russian  Orthodox church to sculptures from the Far East and ritual African masks.78  The theory of intellectual overtone montage, which is supposed to be carried  </page> <page sequence="32"> 278 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  out as “attack into the very heart of objects and phenomena”,79 merely il- lustrates a literal and highly museum-like arrangement of sacred objects. The differences between Vertov’s and Eisenstein’s theories of montage  lies above all in differing concepts of how human perception relates to  its technological conditions. The “sorts of vibrations”80 that Eisenstein’s  cameraman Tissé put into the work as the true virtuosity of the medium by  means of camera movements, f luctuations of light, various focal lengths,  gradations, and motivic tensions must, under Eisenstein’s direction,  always remain connected to fundamental dominants in terminology.  Vibrating itself can no longer be a f ilm effect, it must remain hidden, like  the famous dwarf in his chess machine, and the truth of the cinema has  to resign itself to the law of dialectical materialism. Eisenstein counters  the skeptics of his montage theory with a striking argument from Lenin’s  Conspectus of Hegel’s Book “The Science of Logic”.81 The new man need not  be able to recognize the technical conditions of his own existence if only  he understands the dialectic. Eisenstein does not explain f ilm starting  from f ilm technology, but proposes it in networks of signif ication for  persons of the Gutenberg galaxy. His f ilms reenact this position. The well- known example of the three marble lions that rise up after one another  in Battleship Potemkin is a “movement” that only stands metaphorically  for cinematic perception. Unlike Vertov’s demonstration of watching  movement in f ilm, Eisenstein leaves his spectators with an indication  of what has happened psycho-physically. Psychoanalysis and literature  will lead Eisenstein ever closer to ecstasy than to a “certain f lickering” in  the image.82 But they also do not get him any closer to the conditions of  his own perception. While Eisenstein wanted to reforge the essence of the Soviet man,  Vertov experimented with technology itself to experience the essence of  the new man. But he had to run the risk that he, if he wanted to experi- ence the essence of technology, would no longer be the one to have this  experience. Anyone who goes so far into relativity can no longer ask what  he has lost: We fall, we rise... together with the rhythm of movements – slowed and  accelerated, running from us, past us, toward us, in a circle, or straight line, or ellipse, to the right and left, with plus and minus signs; movements bend, straighten, divide, break apart, multiply, shooting noiselessly through space.83 </page> </plain_text>
