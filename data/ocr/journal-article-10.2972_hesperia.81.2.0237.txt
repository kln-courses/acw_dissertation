The Calendar Frieze on the  Church of Ayios Eleutherios (Little Metropolis) in Athens presumably depicts  the 12 Athenian months, with the Panathenaic ship representing the month of  Hekatombaion. Although badly damaged, the frieze preserves details of the  vessel, its rig, and land transport system. This representation demonstrates  clearly that the Panathenaic ship is patterned after an Archaic galley. A ship  model/lamp from the Erechtheion may represent the Panathenaic ship.  Finally, the author evaluates two additional ship representations—one from  the Kerameikos and one from the City Eleusinion—identified previously as  representations of the Panathenaic ship. INTRODUCTION In this article I collect and evaluate the iconographic evidence that survives  for the Panathenaic ship.1 The Panathenaia was the most important festival  in the Athenian religious calendar and celebrated the traditional birthday of  Athens’ patron goddess, Athena; ancient sources also associate the festival  with the victory of the Olympian gods over the Giants.2 This celebration,  perhaps the best known of all the Athenian festivals, took place toward  1.

Compelling arguments have been presented against this inter- pretation, however.18 Scholars debate the date of the introduction of a ship-on-wheels into  the Panathenaia.19 Some consider the Panathenaic ship-on-wheels to have  existed from the inception of the festival.20 J. M. Mansfield believes that  the Panathenaic ship memorialized the Athenian contribution to the Battle  of Salamis in 480 b.c. and that one of the Greek or enemy triremes that  fought there had been absorbed into the festival.21 Naomi Norman prefers to link the introduction of the Panathenaic  ship to the procession with the phenomenon of rulers dedicating ships  during the Hellenistic period.22 She emphasizes that literary references  and iconographic representations of the vessel are few in number and late  in date.23 Norman suggests that Demetrios Poliorketes presented the first  Panathenaic ship to the people of Athens and their patron goddess for the  Great Panathenaia of 302 b.c.24 ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ANCIENT SHIP  ICONOGRAPHY Before we turn to the iconographic evidence for the Panathenaic ship, it  is important to be cognizant of some basic considerations regarding the  interpretation of ancient ship imagery. René Magritte, the Belgian Surrealist  painter, in a famous series of paintings entitled La trahison des images, Les  deux mystères, L’air et le chanson, and so on, painted a smoker’s pipe beneath  which he wrote, “Ceci n’est pas une pipe.”25 In doing so, Magritte points  out the obvious: we are not seeing a smoker’s pipe, but rather a representa- tion of one, and a representation is not the object itself.

Thus, in iconography we see ancient ships as images refracted through  the eyes, minds, and hands of their creators, as well as through their culture,  schooling, mental attitudes, and skill sets. Other major influences are the  various types of medium and art styles employed (stone, metal, paint, graffito,  etc.). Constraints placed on the artist of horizontal and vertical space can  also lead to dramatic differences between the prototype and its reproduction. SHIP REPRESENTATIONS Ship on the Calendar Frieze In contrast to the textual evidence for the Panathenaic ship and its inte- gral role in the Great Panathenaia, depictions of the vessel are limited.26  The Calendar Frieze, which contains the best-known representation of  the Panathenaic ship, now graces the Small Metropolitan Church of  Ayios Eleutherios, also known as the Little Metropolis, in central Athens  (Fig. 1).27 The frieze has been variously dated by scholars from the Late  Hellenistic period to the 2nd century a.d.28  The frieze originally displayed the 12 Athenian months, with repre-  sentative symbols of the main festivals that took place during each month.29  The relief is composed of two long and narrow blocks that had been re- moved from an older building. Unfortunately, their total combined length  proved to be greater than the church’s facade, so to fit the available space,  each block had a section removed.30 The left block lost the month of  Anthesteria, which may have contained a representation of the Dionysian  ship cart. The right block had its right extremity removed, with the loss  of the month of Gamelion. This is all the more lamentable, as the persons  who removed these decorations could have instead shortened the inner  sides of the two blocks, which had been left undecorated.31 The image of the Panathenaic ship, located on the block representing  the month of Hekatombaion, has suffered severe degradation. Over the left  side of the frieze, Byzantine artisans carved three crosses inside roundels,  one of them directly over the vessel (Fig. 2). The encircled cross very nearly  obliterated the ship. The spaces inside the roundel between the cross’s  arms, as well as along the outer edge of the roundel (A), were chiseled out,  and here all detail is lost. The cross and most of the roundel (B) appear to  have been smoothed, destroying any plastic relief, but leaving visible some  deeply carved details of the vessel and its conveyance. On the lower left  side of the raised part of the roundel—from 5 to 9 o’clock—plastic relief  survives. A horizontal crack (C) begins to the right of the cross above the  26.

S. Pittakis proposed already  in 1862, has more recently been put forward again by H. G. Martin.48 Carl Boetticher, the model’s excavator, originally determined that the  ship-shaped lamp had been an ex voto to Poseidon, and concluded from this  that the Erechtheion housed a cult for that deity.49 Unfortunately for this  theory, conservation revealed a dedicatory inscription to Athena in stippling  on the hull’s port side: IEPON THΣ AΘHNΑΣ (“sacred to Athena”).

T. Williams note that the circumstances of the model’s  discovery inside the Erechtheion in 1862, as described by Paton, suggest  that it had been contributed to the ErFeicgh. t1h3eion and was not an accidental  artifact from an earlier era at the site.52 If this is true, the model’s interment  must postdate the completion of Fthige.  E13rechtheion in 406 b.c.  This is curious for, as noted by Basch and discussed above, the Erech-  theion model clearly replicates an Archaic-period galley.53 Morrison and  Williams note that the model could have existed for an extended period  of time and then been inscribed much later, at the time of its dedica- tion.54 A simpler explanation of this seeming enigma, however, is that the  model represents a 4th-century b.c. votive model of the contemporaneous  Panathenaic ship, which had been deliberately patterned after an Archaic  galley. In that case, the creation of the model and the inscribing of its  dedication could have occurred more or less simultaneously.55 Is the Erechtheion ship model a representation of the Panathenaic  ship? The answer to this question must be based first and foremost on a  comparison between the model and the Calendar Frieze’s Panathenaic ship.  The Erechtheion model’s keel rises in the stern. The bow bears a chisel- shaped waterline ram (Figs. 12:a, 13:a). The lamp nozzle sits above and  50.

In an actual  ship the forecastle would have been situated forward, directly in the bow,  but given the location of the nozzle, the model-maker was forced to move  it astern. The shape of the forecastle, however, is similar to forecastles  appearing commonly in the bows of representations of Archaic galleys.56  There is no evidence of ophthalmoi. Parallel engraved lines run the length of either side of the hull (Figs. 12,  13:a). Morrison and Williams are probably correct in interpreting these  as wales. A series of circles positioned between these lines and the cap- rail indicate oarports. The model’s caprails are topped by a rope motif  (Figs. 12, 13:a), which Morrison and Williams identify as a hypozoma, a  type of cable believed to control torsion in the hulls of Classical galleys.57  Basch, however, correctly notes that ropes placed in the manner seen here  could not have served a functional role and, therefore, he proposes that  such ropes played a purely decorative purpose.58 Alternately, this motif may  represent a wooden caprail decorated in a rope motif. A horizontal guard- rail protecting the stern deck is supported forward on two stanchions. It  loops behind the sternpost. This feature also appears frequently on Archaic  galleys (Fig. 14).59 The ship has three beams and a single throughbeam at the stern for  attaching the quarter rudders (Fig. 13:a).60 Only the protruding ends of the  throughbeam jutting out from the hull are depicted: the beam is missing  inside the hull but must have existed in the prototype vessel.

After Göttlicher 1978,   Panathenaic ship is “horizontally challenged.”62 The ship’s length has been pl. 27:362  curtailed disproportionately and the depiction is far more squat than the  original vessel it represents. It is as if the vessel’s midsection has been removed  and the stem and stern attached to each other (see Fig. 11). This becomes  immediately clear when the Panathenaic ship on the Calendar Frieze is com- pared to the majority of other known representations of Archaic galleys.63 Thus, to correctly overlay the profile of the Erechtheion model on the  Calendar Frieze vessel, the former must be similarly shortened longitu- dinally amidships (Fig. 16). Also, license must be given for the displace- ment of the forecastle screen (Fig. 16:3a, 3b) due to the addition of the  lamp nozzle (2) over the model’s bow. When these two considerations are  taken into account and the profile outline of the model’s bow is overlaid  on the Calendar Frieze Panathenaic ship, we see an almost perfect fit. At 62.

When this is done, the two bird beaks at the sternpost align with  the sinuous line on the lower left extremity of the cross’s left arm on the  Calendar Frieze (Figs. 5:A, 16:6). This bird-head form of an Archaic ship  sternpost finial often ended in a sinuous curve that represented, if only in the  abstract, a waterbird’s head and beak (Fig. 14).64 This is perhaps the most  notable of the correspondences between the two representations. While  the comparison between the two images is not exact, it is truly remark- able given the divergent mediums of the two representations and the time  period separating them. As noted, both vessels have a chisel-shaped ram  (Fig. 16:1), but on neither of these do we see the typical boar-head-shaped  ram so typical of Archaic galleys, nor the quintessential three-level ram of  war galleys of the 5th century b.c. and later.65  There are, however, two important differences between the representa- tions that require clarification. The first is that the Calendar Frieze galley  has a prominent proembolion, which is lacking on the Erechtheion model.  There are two possible explanations for this seeming disparity. Perhaps the  model’s lamp nozzle was meant to do double duty, also standing in for the  proembolion for, when seen in profile, they have a somewhat similar shape  (Fig. 16:2). A second, more likely, possibility is that the Panathenaic ship  would have been repaired or replaced repeatedly during the centuries in  which it was in use, as for example under Herodes Atticus and in the re- furbishing of the timbers of the sacred ship of Theseus (Plut. Thes. 23.1): The ship on which Theseus sailed with the youths and returned in  safety, the thirty-oared galley, was preserved by the Athenians down  to the time of Demetrius Phalereus. They took away the old timbers  from time to time, and put new and sound ones in their places, so  that the vessel became a standing illustration for the philosophers in  the mooted question of growth, some declaring that it remained the  same, others that it was not the same vessel.66 Egypt supplies an interesting documented ancient parallel to the re-  peated replacement of a cult ship over time. The vessel of Amun, the Amun-  userhet, which transported the Egyptian deity’s cult statue on the Nile,  was built anew at great expense whenever it was deemed necessary.67 The  best known of these iterations is one for which Wenamun journeyed to  Byblos under the commission of Herihor, High Priest of Amun, to acquire  Lebanese cedar for its construction.68 Thus, the Erechtheion model and the  64.

The second apparent difference between the two representations is that,  unlike the Calendar Frieze image, early depictions of the model indicate  that when first discovered, it had a stump amidships, which survived to  about the height of the caprail (Fig. 17).69 Subsequently, this element has  been lost, with only a slight indication of it remaining (Fig. 13:a).

First, the model comes from the Erechtheion and is dedicated to Athena.  What vessel could be more appropriate to dedicate to Athena than the  Panathenaic ship? Second, while the model clearly replicates an Archaic  galley, the dedicatory inscription dates to the 4th century b.c. The simplest  explanation of this paradox is that the donor commissioned a lamp in the  form of the existing Panathenaic ship, had the model engraved with an  appropriate dedicatory inscription, and then gave it to the Erechtheion,  all during the 4th century b.c. Finally, the Erechtheion model agrees  remarkably well in shape with the Panathenaic ship portrayed on the  Calendar Frieze. The Kerameikos Ship Model  Scholars have proposed that two other ship representations depict the  Panathenaic ship. The first, suggested by Martin, is a stray find in the  Kerameikos of a ship model made primarily of Pentelic marble.72 The find  location is of interest for, as noted above, the Panathenaic procession began  at the Dipylon Gate, located in the Kerameikos. Unfortunately, the two  most diagnostic parts of any ship model—the bow and the stern—have  been lost. For convenience, then, in the following discussion, I term the  model’s two ends “extremity X” and “extremity Y” (Fig. 18). The model is now broken into three parts and, although the bow and  stern are missing, the model clearly represents a galley on the basis of both  the oarports along the sides of the hull and its long and narrow proportions.  The vessel has two rows of oarports in which every third hole is larger than  its neighbor and has bronze fragments still embedded in it, presumably all  that remains of the original metal oars. The lower row of oarports exists  only on extremity X, while the upper row appears at both extremities, but  not amidships (Fig. 18:a, b).73 Martin concludes that this area of the hull  71.

After inscription—MINOKIA—that appears on either side of it (Fig. 18:a, b).75  Martin 1999, pp. 138–139, 141, figs. 1–8  He reasonably suggests that this was the name of the prototype ship. The  inscription’s paleography dates to the 4th century b.c. or later.76 The name  MINOKIA seems a strange one for a Panathenaic ship, but Martin notes  that none of the names for this series of vessels have come down to us and  he speculates that each Panathenaic ship may have received an individual  name to differentiate one from the other.77 Jeffrey Hurwit and Hector  Williams suggested independently to me that the vessel’s name may hint  that the Kerameikos ship model replicates the sacred ship of Theseus.78 While admitting that the Kerameikos model might have been a grave  gift or a dedication, Martin concludes that it probably represents a Pan-  athenaic ship, primarily due to two considerations: the evidence for it having  been mounted on a carriage; and a hole in the center of the upper surface  of extremity X (Fig. 18:c, see arrows). Martin argues that this hole served  to step the model’s mast.79 But the direction of the hole’s bore would cause  any mast placed in it to slant toward extremity Y.80 In other words, accord- ing to Martin’s reconstruction, the mast was stepped in the bow and raked  toward the stern—the exact opposite of the manner in which it appears  to be depicted in the Calendar Frieze (Fig. 11).81 There are at least four  possible explanations for this seeming discrepancy: 1. My proposed reconstruction of the mast on the Calendar Frieze  Panathenaic ship is incorrect. 2. The Kerameikos model does not represent a Panathenaic ship. 3. The various iterations of the Panathenaic ship handled the  mast in divergent fashions and the Calendar Frieze and the  Kerameikos models represent two different Panathenaic ships. 4. Martin has reversed the bow and stern, and extremity Y is actu- ally the bow, not the stern. If the bow and stern were reversed  in this manner, then the Kerameikos model would parallel  the depiction in the Calendar Frieze and the broadest part of  the model (Fig. 18:c, d) would be near the stern, as is the case  with the Erechtheion model (Fig. 13:b).82 The appearance of  the inscriptions on extremity X might seem at first to support  the interpretation that this extremity is the model’s bow, but in  antiquity, as today, naming devices could be placed at the bow  or the stern, and the latter was the location of the stylis, a ship  identification device that appears in the Classical period.83  For the reasons just stated, I prefer the final explanation. While the  Kerameikos ship model may represent the Panathenaic ship, the evidence  is somewhat more equivocal than in the case of the Erechtheion ship  model/lamp.84 74.

Spetsieri-Choremi  2000, p. 2, fig. 1  Ship on a  Marble Relief Fragment from the City  Eleusinion  Alkestis Spetsieri-Choremi has identified part of a ship’s stern appearing  on a Pentelic marble relief fragment from the area of the City Eleusinion  as a representation of a Panathenaic ship, and proposed a reconstruction  (Figs. 19, 20).85 Two registers are visible on the fragment. The upper reg- ister depicts part of the midsection and stern of a galley. The lower register  contains the effaced heads of several figures carrying objects in a procession. The whole scene is badly abraded, making any interpretation dif- ficult. The most prominent detail on the ship is a broad horizontal band  running its surviving length, which I take to be a wale. As on the other  representations proposed for the Panathenaic ship, no outrigger is visible.  The upper-right portion of the hull has been chipped off. Beneath the  ship is a narrow rectangular carved depression, which presumably rep- resents the space beneath the hull between two badly worn features that  Spetsieri-Choremi interprets conditionally as wheels (Fig. 19, see arrows).86  However, these objects are too small—especially when compared to the  wheels on the Calendar Frieze ship—to represent wheels. I take them for  chocks or, more probably, the ends of logs on which the hull rests.87 To  the left of these are two long and narrow objects, which slant upward from  the register’s baseline at a 60° angle from the horizontal and terminate at 85.

For example, an Aegean-style ship graffito,  ca. 13th–12th centuries b.c., from Dakhla Oasis depicts figures holding up  ship models in a cult scene that is taking place on board the vessel (Fig. 22,  arrows).91 At the other end of the chronological spectrum, I witnessed a  similar occurrence in 1998 in Luxor while recording the moulid (birthday  90.

During the moulid, celebrants draw boats mounted on wagons around a  processional route (dura). During the 1998 celebrations, several men in a  processional boat belonging to the felucca-men held up models of their  namesake vessels (Figs. 23 [see arrows], 24).  FINAL THOUGHTS I leave it to scholars of Greek religion to determine whether the clues to  the appearance of the Panathenaic ship presented here contribute to a bet- ter understanding of the cultic aspects of the ship used in this important  Athenian festival. I offer here only a few thoughts regarding pertinent  nautical considerations. Beyond reasonable doubt the Erechtheion ship model/lamp joins the  Calendar Frieze ship relief as a bona fide representation of a Panathenaic  ship. The attributes of the Kerameikos ship model are also consistent  with information available on the Panathenaic ship from the Calendar  Frieze. Given the name MINOKIA engraved on the Kerameikos model,  however, one cannot rule out the suggestion by Hurwit and Williams  that the name could indicate that the model instead represents the sacred  ship of Theseus.

As opposed, however, to the ship  cart of Dionysos, which appears in artwork from that century, we have no  specific references that early for the Panathenaic ship in art or in text. In  theory, the ship could have been introduced later, but was deliberately built  to represent an older form of the ship to add gravitas at its introduction.  Consider, for example, the ship sent to Delos by Athens each year, said  to be the original one used by Theseus.93 Note, however, that this ship  remained a triakonter, a 30-oared ship, which was apparently the nearest  that the Athenians of the Classical period could come to an “ancient” ship  from the time of Theseus. Deborah Carlson, in her recent detailed study of marble ophthalmoi,  has proposed alternative explanations as to why three fragmentary ships’  eyes were found at the Athenian Agora.94 One possibility, which Carlson  considers remote, is that these objects may have been attached to Panathenaic  ships. As discussed above, ophthalmoi do not appear on the Calendar Frieze  ship or on the Erechtheion model.95 While it is possible that an ophthalmos  was painted on the former, the absence of the feature on the model argues  against this conclusion, suggesting that the Panathenaic ship did not bear 93.
