<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREFACE This volume contains most of the lectures delivered in the First Interna tional Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism, which was convened in Jerusalem in February 1984, in memory of the late Prof. Gershom Scholem. Some of the papers included here were written by scholars who could not participate in the conference itself, and mailed their articles. The conference was organized by the Gershom Scholem Center for the Study of Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah, which was established at the Hebrew University by the Faculty of Humanities and its Institute of Jewish Studies, and the Jewish National and University Library. The conference was convened two years after Prof. Scholem's death, and was the first in a series of such conferences which will be held every other year in memory of the great scholar who founded the modern scholarly study of Jewish mysticism. The Gershom Scholem Center was established at the Hebrew Univer sity through the joint efforts of the Faculty of Humanities and the Institute of Jewish Studies and the Jewish National and University Library. Its tasks include the organization of the Gershom Scholem Library, in which the 25,000-volume library of the great scholar is made available to the scholars in the field of Jewish mysticism. A catalogue of the unique collection of works relating to Jewish mysticism in this library is presently being prepared for publication. The Center also supports the publication of Scholem's books in an updated form. The bi-annual conferences in memory of Gershom Scholem are organized by the Center, with the generous assistance of the Robert Bosch Stiftung GMBH in Stuttgart. The first conference was dedicated to Early Jewish Mysticism; the second, in 1984, dealt with the beginnings of Jewish mysticism in medieval Europe, and the third, which will be held in 1988, will study the Zohar and its period. Ancient Jewish Mysticism, to which this volume is dedicated has become the subject of intensive scholarly study, following the publica tion of Gershom Scholem's "Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism</page><page sequence="2">and Talmudic Tradition" in 1960. Today there are groups of scholars working on the subject in Germany, Holland, France, England and Israel, and some of the results of their work is presented in the following pages. The opening lecture of the conference was delivered by Prof. Peter Schäfer, of the Free University, Berlin, and his paper, "The Problem of the Redactionist Identity of'Hekhalot Rabbati,'" opens this volume as well. Prof. Schäfer presents in detail the problems arising from the analysis of the position of the text "Hekhalot Rabbati" in the manus cripts of Hekhalot mysticism. The manuscripts do not present a definite literary unit called "Hekhalot Rabbati", rather, according to various definitions it is possible to present this work as including different materials, and ending in different ways. There is no clear connection between the accepted titles and contents of Hekhalot tractates and the situation present in the manuscripts. Prof. Schäfer suggests, therefore, that scholars should not treat these accepted tractates as historical literary facts. Dr. Rachel Elior, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, dedicates her study, "The Concept of God in Hekhalot Mysticism" to a detailed attempt to describe the main characteristic of the divine world as presented in Hekhalot literature as a whole. The concept of God as an integral part of a comprehensive mystical encounter between the "des cender to the chariot" and the divine realm, are described in detail. The five main elements in this mystical phenomenon are, according to Elior: The mystical name of God and its hidden and revealed aspects; the infinite structure of the divine "body" — the "Shiur Komah;" the infinite beauty of God and the celestial realm; the "raz", the supreme secret, which is understood by the author as the dynamic element in the concept of God; and the divine glory, the "kavod", the essence of the chariot and the divine palaces. These together create the unique world of Hekhalot mysticism. Prof. Ithamar Gruenwald of Tel Aviv University dedicates his com prehensive study, "The Impact of Priestly Traditions on the Creation of Merkabah Mysticism and the 'Shiur Komah'" to a detailed analysis of the various mystical traditions in Judaism between the biblical period and the emergence of Hekhalot mysticism. He explains his conclusion that there was a direct line of development which leads from biblical and VI</page><page sequence="3">second-commonwealth struggles between the priestly circles around the temple and anti-priestly attitudes to the creation of Jewish mysticism in the talmudic period. Evidence collected from many sources, especially apocalyptic literature, lead Gruenwald to his description of Hekhalot mysticism as a continuation of mystical phenomena connected with earlier conflicts among Jewish spiritualists. Prof. Lawrence H. Schiffman of New York University, who is an expert in Qumran studies, outlines in his paper "Hekhalot Mysticism and the Qumran Literature" the various levels of contact betwen the literature found in the Judea desert and the various Hekhalot texts. Schiffman finds close parallels between the descriptions of the celestial chariot in these two groups of religious texts, as well as in details concerning the throne of glory, the archangels, magical and mystical elements and even in literary style. He concludes, however, that there is not enough evidence to prove that there was a direct contact between the Hekhalot mystics and the Qumran sect, and the parallels could be the result of using common sources. The relationship between midrashic literature and Hekhalot mysti cism is the subject of Dr. Jacob Elbaum's study, "Tana Devey Eliyahu and Ancient Esoteric Literature". The author studies in detail the various elements in this central midrashic work which are related to Hekhalot mysticism — the attitude towards the Song of Songs, the descent to the chariot, the descriptions of the angelic world and the divine chariot, comparing them to Hekhalot texts. His conclusion is that though there are points in which the midrash is close to the mystical texts, the main purpose of Tana Devey Eliyahu is to describe the relationship between God and Israel, and not those between the mystic and the divine realm. Prof. Moshe Idel, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, dedicates his article, Enoch is Metatron to one oi the most dimcult and mtrigu ing myths in Hekhalot mysticism — the transformation of Enoch son of Jared into the archangel Metatron, who is described in Hekhalot litera ture as second only to God himself in the celestial hierarchy. Idel analyzes midrashic and mystical traditions concerning the primordial exalted state of Adam and compares them to those related to the myth of the ascension of Enoch, and finds close parallels between them. It is possible, according to this material, that Enoch achieved what Adam VII</page><page sequence="4">should have achieved, and that the analysis reveals the existence of a stratum of mystical traditions in Judaism from which midrashic scho lars, as well as early and later Jewish mystics drew many of their ideas. Dr. Yehuda Liebes, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, analyzes in his paper, "The Angels of the Shofar and Yeshua Sar Ha-Panim" a phrase included in the Rosh ha-Shanah prayer service, which mentions three archangels in charge of the sound of the shofar — Eliyahu, Metatron and "Yeshua Sar Ha-Panim". The author traces the origins of this phrase to the mystical circles in medieval Germany and the Hekha lot mystical traditions, and proves that "Yeshua" is none other than Jesus. The phrase, so it seems, mentions the three archangels who have human origin, and it constitutes one of the few Jewish-Christian tradi tions which remained within Jewish rituals. The problem of the various strata of mystical visions which together constitute Hekhalot texts is the subject of the study by Prof. Joseph Dan of the Hebrew University. "The Entrance to the Sixth Gate". The texts of Hekhalot Zutartey and Hekhalot Rabbati contain several conflicting descriptions of a hazardous test that the mystics have to face when they enter the sixth celestial palace. Analysis of the different versions of these tests seems to prove that the authors of the Hekhalot texts had before them an ancient myth, probably created by early mystics, which they tried in different ways to integrate into their later systems of Hekhalot mysticism. Dr. Meir Bar-Ilan,of Bar Ilan University, describes in his paper, "The Idea of Crowning God in Hekhalot Mysticism and the Karaitic Polemic" the development of a central theme in Jewish prayer: Putting a crown on God's head. A detailed analysis of the development of this theme in Talmudic literature and in early versions of the Jewish prayer seem to denote a connection to the extensive descriptions of the process found in Hekhalot mysticism. This subject, connected also with the description of God wearing philacteries, was the subject of attack by the Karaites, who used these elements to prove the anthropomorphic con ception of God in rabbinic Judaism. Prof. Rivkah Shatz, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, deals in her article, "Gnostic Literature as a Source of Shlomo Molcho's 'Sefer ha-Mefoar'" with several central themes in Molcho's mysticism, which seem to be based on sections from Hekhalot mysticism. The martyrio VIII</page><page sequence="5">logical legend of the "ten martyrs", as well as various elements in the gnostic story of the creation of Man, indicate the deep impact that this ancient mystic tradition had on the mysticism of Molcho. The author compares central subjects like the revelation of the divine glory, the story of paradise, the revelation of secrets to Adam and others, and proves how they were integrated into the visions of "Sefer ha-Mefoar". Prof. Ira Chemus, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, dedicates his article, "The Pilgrimage to the Merkavah: An Interpretation of Early Jewish Mysticism" to an attempt to identify the deep sociological and spiritual causes of the emergence of Hekhalot mysticism. Chernus ana lyzes the concept of "pilgrimage" in Israel, and puts forward the thesis that the ascension to the divine chariot in early Jewish mysticism can be understood as a mystical substitution to the practice of pilgrimage which had stopped after the destruction of the Second Temple. He sees in Merkavah literature a mystical attempt to overcome the trauma of the destruction, like other elements in second-century Jewish culture which were designed to replace early religious practices. Prof. Arnold Goldberg of the University of Frankfurt, in his study, "Quotations from Scripture in Hekhalot Literature" analyzes in detail the typology of the use of scriptural verses in Hekhalot literature. He compares Hekhalot mystical texts to midrashic use of verses in a meta linguistic way and to apocalyptic literature's use of them in a linguistic objective way. These two basic attitudes to biblical verses are found in Hekhalot literature, for both of them contain a mystical element — either in the visions of apocalyptic literature or in the meeting with God through the text in midrashic literature. The Hekhalot mystics used both ways in their texts to express their own novel mystical attitudes. Prof. Karl Erich Grözinger the University of Frankfurt of dedicates his study: "The Names of God and the Celestial Powers: Their Function and Meaning in the Hekhalot Literature" to an attempt to understand one of the most perplexing elements in Hekhalot texts — the meaning of the countless names of divine and celestial powers in these texts. The author does not accept the thesis that these names are nothing but "nomina barbara", without any systematic meaning. He proves, by analyzing several examples, that the ancient mystics believed that these names contain a hidden mystical message. Prof. Grözinger shows that these names reflect an ancient mystical tradition which was incorpo IX</page><page sequence="6">rated into Hekhalot literature, a tradition that had an impact not only on Hekhalot mysticism but on later kabbalah as well. Dr. A.P. Hayman of the University of Edinburgh, who published several studies dealing with the ancient cosmological work, Sefer Yesira, dedicates his article , "Sefer Yesira and the Hekhalot Literature" to a comparison between that book and Hekhalot mysticism. The author analyzes in detail the various terms and expressions in Sefer Yesira which seem to indicate that there was some connection between Hekha lot mysticism and the cosmology and cosmogony of Sefer Yesira. His conclusion, however, is that though some similarity can be found between them, there is no proof that there was a direct connection between them. Common sources could explain the similarity, and it is possible that these elements were introduced by later editors of the Sefer Yesira. One of the most interesting sayings in Tannaitic literature which could be viewed as relating to Hekhalot mysticism is the one found in Tosefta Megillah 3:28, stating that many had studied the divine chariot without ever seeing it. Analysis of this section is the subject of the paper by Prof. N. A. Van Uchelen, of the University of Amsterdam. The author reviews the many interpretations offered to this statement, and after analyzing the various possibilities he concludes that it should be under stood as continuing the immediate context in the Tosefta, as a parallel to a blind man's ability to bless the sun and moon without ever seeing them. Dr. Margarete Schlüter of the Free University of Berlin, is preparing a detailed study of the various blessings and eulogies included in Hekhalot literature. Within this framework she dedicates her article "The Eulogy Haham ha Razim ve'Adon HaStarim in Hekhalot Literature" to Hek halot mystics' use of a blessing to God's knowledge of mysteries. This eulogy is usually incorporated in Hekhalot hymnology, and the author analyzes the various contexts of its appearance, trying to show its integration in the literary and ideological elements surrounding it. Her conclusion is that in many cases the eulogy is not directly related to the context, and that its use is different from the practice common to blessings in the prayers. Prof. David J. Halperin, of the University of North Carolina, dedi cates his article, "A Sexual Image in Hekhalot Rabbati and Its Implica</page><page sequence="7">tions" to a section in Hekhalot Rabbati describing the terror inflicted by the celestial beasts on the mystic, when their eyes are described as 'kevara'. The author analyzes the meaning of this term in talmudic literature, and reaches the conclusion that in Hekhalot Rabbati it has a definite sexual meaning. Halperin explains the psychological back ground of such erotic expressions and their place in Hekhalot mysticism. It seems that this is the first time that a collection of seventeen articles, all dedicated to one specific subject in the history of Je wish msyticism, is presented to the scholarly community. This is a demonstration of the continuing interest in ancient Jewish mysticism and the development of scholarship in this field, following Gershom Scholem's enormous con tribution to the modern understanding of this complex historical and ideological problem. It is hoped that this collection will assist scholars in their continuing effort to study this and other subjects. This volume is a presentation of the proceedings of a scholarly conference, and therefore the papers are printed in the way they were written by the participants. No attempt was made to present all these articles in common format. It did not seem advisable to try to unify the various ways that key terms are used or even spelled, for it seems that we are still quite far from a universally accepted norm in this field. The publication of this volume was made possible by a grant from the Robert Bosch Stiftung GMBH in Stuttgart, which also supported the Conference itself. Thanks are also due to Prof. Malachi Beit-Arie, the chairman of the Gershom Scholem Center for the Study of Jewish Mysticism, to the Jewish National and University Library which is the publisher of the Center's books, and to the editors of Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought who agreed to incorporate this volume in the JSJT series.
