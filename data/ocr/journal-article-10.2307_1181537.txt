Finally, the book tries to do too many things. The author fails to connect the portable radio as object, the portable radio as concept, the portable radio as stolen tech- nology, and the large amount of contextual history that is included. Neither the book's organization nor the analytical framework Schiffer develops (the ideas of cultural imperatives and cryptohis- tory) help to bring his material, or his different goals, together. SUSAN SMULYAN Brown University Karen Lucic. Charles Sheeler and the Cult of the Machine. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991; London: Reaktion Books, 1991. 167 pp.; 70 black and white and color illustrations, chronol- ogy, bibliography, index. $34.95 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). Just as there is something vaguely disturbing about the paintings of Charles Sheeler, so too is there an unsettling quality to Karen Lucic's extended essay on his work, Charles Sheeler and the Cult of the Ma- chine. The clear, hard, precise lines of Sheeler's art are echoed in the clarity of Lucic's prose. Both are in a sense crystalline; that is, they suggest revela- tion rendered inaccessible by a deceptively smooth surface. For all the apparent placidity of Sheeler's most characteristic paintings, such as Classic Land- scape or Upper Deck, upon examining them we are aware that something has just happened or, more ominously, that something is about to happen. The anxiety of his art, so like that of de Chirico's, appears most obviously in a painting like Ameri- cana-a domestic interior scene with warm hues that invite us and an interrupted backgammon game that prompts us to speculate on the possible cause of the players' apparently precipitous ab- sence. Sheeler's more typical paintings of urban and industrial landscapes render scenes such as in- tricate factory piping or powerful machinery in moments of repose, in between those frequent but also miraculous explosions of energy that propel the social transformations of the twentieth century. Whether we view his machine-age landscapes as emblematic of the fullness of progress or of the emptiness of loss depends on the interpretive frame we bring to them. In a similar manner, Lucic also proceeds by way of absence. Her relatively short text is spare and succinct. It encompasses the following: a historical overview of the interwar "machine age" and of what artists and commentators intended when they talked about it; a brief biographical sketch of Sheeler's early career; and three sections describ- ing and analyzing the artist's urban views, his in- dustrial scenes, and what Lucic refers to as his ma- chine-age interiors (a category that oddly includes some later exterior scenes as well). Throughout her interpretation of Sheeler's work there is a sense of absence suggested most vividly by her reli- ance on questions to further her presentation. The essay contains at least twenty-seven questions, of- ten grouped by twos or threes, sometimes rhetori- cal but sometimes left disturbingly unanswered. Her presentation often proceeds by means of op- position, with "but" or "yet" as frequent con- nectives; such adjectives as "odd," "puzzling," or "enigmatic" are typical. These strategies, by contin- ually postponing judgment, maintain in the text itself a feeling of ambiguity and ambivalence simi- lar to that found by Lucic in the misleading clarity and precision of Sheeler's characteristic style. In the introduction Lucic insists on the neces- sity of going beyond interpretations by critics and earlier art historians and even beyond Sheeler's own comments about his work. Although attentive to such evidence, as well as to the cultural and social contexts of the artist's time, she also notes her "fundamental" reliance on an "empathetic reading" of Sheeler's paintings and photographs (p. 15). This approach accepts the contemporary truism that no observer can avoid becoming part of and interfering with a system under observa- tion. Lucic's insistence that Sheeler's art reflects an ambivalence about modernity in fact depends on her awareness of the recent decline of American manufacturing and the ongoing collapse of Ameri- can cities as habitable places. "Today," she writes in the essay's concluding sentences, "as the infra- structure of American industry crumbles into de- cay, this aspect of Sheeler's machine-age iconog- raphy presses upon us more urgently. Viewing Sheeler's factories in the present moment compels us to feel the full impact of their abandonment" (p. 141). In effect, then, an empathetic approach risks the danger of reading the present into the past, but it also revivifies Sheeler's work. To con- ceive of him as a "high priest" of the cult of the machine holds no more than historical interest for us in these final years of the twentieth century. By contrast, to conceive of him as a "heretic" to that cult-the other pole of the opposition that Lucic 200</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews creates (p. 14)-is to imbue his work with contem- porary significance. Her reinterpretation works most convincingly when she focuses attention on the painting Ameri- can Landscape (1930), a view of the Ford manufac- turing complex seen from across the River Rouge and reflected in its calm water. Questioning Leo Marx's interpretation of the painting in his influ- ential The Machine in the Garden (1964) as "the in- dustrial landscape pastoralized" by a superimposi- tion of "order, peace, and harmony," she points to the tiny figure of a man running along a railway track in the distance-one of the few representa- tions of humanity in Sheeler's paintings and the only instance in which Lucic chooses to use a detail illustration (p. 104). Dwarfed by the factory com- plex, trapped within the lines of its railway tracks, this figure suggests not the ambiguity but the abso- lute horror of a wholly artificial world. Lucic point- edly ends her discussion of industrial landscapes with the ironically named Water (1945), with its vaguely anthropomorphic pumping stations, de- void of human operators, looming grimly over a massive pipeline in a sterile desert. Her reinterpre- tation of Sheeler successfully reveals just how far out of step he was with the celebrants of the ma- chine age even in his earliest work, a fact observed by his friend William Carlos Williams but until now not fully understood. JEFFREY L. MEIKLE University of Texas at Austin Robert Jay. The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey: Hawaii and California. Honolulu: Uni- versity of Hawaii Press, 1992. x + 206 pp.; 14 color plates, black and white illustrations, bibliog- raphy, index. $45.00. Charles W. Dickey was a prolific architect working in Hawaii and California from 1896 to 1941, and he is considered by regional architecture histori- ans, architects, and builders to have been one of Hawaii's leading designers in the pre-World War II period. Dickey's professional achievements in- clude large-scale commissions for educational and medical institutions, religious groups, commer- cial clients, and the government, and designs for private residences. His surviving California work includes the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley and Kahn's Department Store in Oakland, and in Ho- nolulu the Stangenwald Building, Alexander and Baldwin Building, Kamehameha Schools, and the U.S. Immigration Station. A number of houses built by Dickey for wealthy clients in Hawaii also exist. They are typically characterized by steep- pitch, double-hipped roofs, extended eaves, and deep and airy lanais (verandas) appropriate in Hawaii's environment. At least a dozen of his dis- tinctive landmarks have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places, a fact that might have interested Dickey, one of the first preservation ar- chitects in the Islands. With the exception of an interpretive essay and a separate research catalogue of Dickey's buildings by J. Meredith Neil, which appeared in the Papers of the American Association of Architectural Bibli- ographers, and The Hawaiian Journal of History, there has been no reliable, liberally illustrated study of Dickey's architecture until the publication of Robert Jay's The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey: Hawaii and California.' Jay has taken a conventional approach to the subject, one committed to building aesthetics, style, and the visual effects of proportion, shape, and ornament as the major components of architec- tural history. His study is complemented through- out, however, by other historical considerations, most notably a discussion of the role of the pri- vate and public support that generally decided when, what, and how Dickey built. The introduc- tory chapter interprets the historical context of nineteenth-century Honolulu building traditions, drawing upon the research by Neil, Charles E. Peterson, and several Australian architecture historians.2 The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey is organized around three phases of Dickey's career: his early work and partnerships in Hawaii after architec- tural training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; twenty years of architectural accom- plishments in Oakland, California; and his profes- sional work in Hawaii from 1925 until his death soon after Pearl Harbor. Jay notes that Dickey was the first person raised in Hawaii to receive a formal architectural education in the United States. His schooling at M.I.T., where he graduated in 1894, 1 J.
