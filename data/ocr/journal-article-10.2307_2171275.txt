Like historical happening itself, the haunted mansion of German historicism has many rooms, and they are arranged more like confounded Chinese boxes or nested catacombs than adjoining chambers. The pas- sageways seem to bring as much labyrinthine involu- tion into perplexity as evolution toward perspicacity. In recent years, a brave "new historicism" has been enlisted into many academic disciplines, even though there is hardly any agreement about what constituted AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 1997</page><page sequence="2">General 91 the old historicism. Charles R. Bambach's suggestive study of German "high historicism" illuminates this still-spiraling process throughout its vertiginous rup- tures as well as its subtle spectral shifts; it also engages a whole array of issues agitating contemporary thought. The reader accustomed to today's "culture wars" about values, tradition, and dominant supposi- tions will find many of the main philosophical fronts carefully elaborated in this work. Bambach contends that there is a deep affinity between historicism as an intellectual outlook and modernity as a way of life: both call notions of foundation, presupposition, and essence constantly into question. We emerge with the compound paradox of "fundamental anti-foundationalism" linked to "cri- sis" as the routine matter-of-course for modern life and thought. Bambach furnishes a lucid guide to the way German thought arrived at the predicament of holding to a larger framework to make sense of historical happening while at the same time disallow- ing any fixed foundations under it or ultimate ends beyond it. The book's arrangement effectively deploys its argu- ment: after setting forth the larger cultural context of German thought "between scientism and historicism," it provides cumulative, interwoven chapters on Wil- helm Windelband's taxonomy of the sciences, Heinrich Rickert's epistemology of the historical knowledge, Wilhelm Dilthey's critique of historical reason, and Martin Heidegger's deconstructive critique of histori- cism itself. Bambach strikes a happy balance between general insight and analytical detail. There are real jewels of insight and thoughtful exposition in this book. Bambach offers terse, probing judgments concerning difficult theoretical issues-no- tably Dilthey's differences with neo-Kantian thought, the tension between relativity and validity after this crucial confrontation, the different forms of value- philosophy, and the "return to metaphysics." Bambach effectively expounds the wrenching antinomies of his- toricism, showing how they carried over into the dark nimbus of post-World War I thought, wafting between nihilism and eschatology. The origins of Heidegger's radical "Destruktion" of Western tradition are com- prehensively examined. Bambach makes judicious use of recent scholarship, including the best interpretive studies and recent primary source material published in the ongoing collected works of Dilthey and Heideg- ger. There are also some problems with this stimulating book- more concerning tone than real substance. But when foundations are being called into question at so many turns of page and event, atmospheric "tone" tends to take on a sort of substance of its own. Awash in the torrent of spiritual crises and radical shifts, the reader undergoes "crisis fatigue," reinforced by Bam- bach's admission that crisis "sold well" and had be- come something of a tired cliche even before World War I. If modernity-or at least German moderni- ty-is (was?) a condition of constant crisis, then a sober, crisis-schooled historicism might be led to ask, "So what else is new?" What can qualify as new, even as a genuinely new crisis, in an ever-shifting framework bereft of normative, "normal," or otherwise traditional notions? Bambach does not press the linkage of actual historical "crisis" and "critical" historical thinking to a convincing conclusion: admittedly, by his reading of the trajectory of historicism, such a conclusion must necessarily remain beyond reach, just as do any fixed foundations. What were the real temporary/temporal compass points defining this engrained and oddly "routine" German tradition of crisis thinking, other than its very fixation on crisis? Was the old historicism simply the absurd exercise of "trying to hold onto the waves amidst a shipwreck," as Heidegger's student, Karl Lowith, once defined it? In his own version of the teleology of German historicism, Bambach tends to slant the presentation toward Heidegger's darkening and harkening utter- ances. In his quest for the ultimate and most radical historical "revisionism" of re-thinking Being (includ- ing being human)-thereby converting human history into temporalized ontology-Heidegger set up many straw concepts, notably the caricature of historicism itself as purblind "scientism" and smug "all-too-hu- manism" conspiring in the blindly anthropomorphic project of the empty "will to will." Historicism was "deconstructed" and execrated for furthering not thoughtful reflection and awareness of "otherness" but rather narcissistic self-indulgence. Bambach rightly insists that German historicism bore little resemblance to Karl Popper's rendition, but in his own zeal to harken to Heidegger's even quirkier version, the author too often rehashes something quite Popperesque in its linear teleology and oddly credu- lous "progressism." The sort of history (and histori- cism) that Friedrich Nietzsche and Heidegger attacked was not the historicism that Dilthey, Ernst Troeltsch, and Max Weber defended. The anchorage of histori- cism in an open-eyed, "critical" humanism awake to the limits of knowledge, will power, science, and technology as well as keenly alert to the inhumane dimensions of history gets somewhat side-lined in Bambach's otherwise probing, fair-minded, and com- prehensive work.
