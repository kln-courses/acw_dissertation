<plain_text><page sequence="1">MITOCHONDRIAL EVE Critical Reflections on an African Basis to Science and Religion LORENZO FORBES Community Hospital of Chester Religious fundamentalists, or creationists as they are sometimes called, are strongly opposed to the current scientific theory of evolution, which holds that modem man arose through the slow process of development from a line of archaic hominids. On the other hand, modem scientists dismiss the arguments of the crea- tionists, who believe in a very young Earth rather than the current geological model, and who believe that the Genesis story is the unerring word of God (Fry, 1983). Many individuals do not have a strong conviction as to which version to believe, but nevertheless they feel threatened by the scientific version because it does not posit a God in the creative process. Most Americans who claim to be born-again Christians believe in the Bible's account of creation (Newell, 1982). The result of this dilemma is that most individuals pay homage to the technological aspect of science as it affects their daily lives, but on certain days they also pay homage to an anthropomorphic God they may not understand but nevertheless fear. It is my con- tention that recent discoveries point to a resolution of this seemingly intractable conflict. The solution to reconciling the views of the creationist and the evolutionist lies in the interpretation of two historic occurrences, one of recent origin and the other from remote antiquity. An examination of modem discoveries, both archeological and biolog- ical, along with a new interpretation of certain ancient mythologies, JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES, Vol. 22 No. 4, June 1992 593-616 ? 1992 Sage Publications, Inc. 593</page><page sequence="2">594 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 will demonstrate with high probability that modem man arose from the deliberate manipulation of genetic material by scientists in antiq- uity, that an identifiable African female immortalized in sculpted works of art served as the egg donor, and that an Egyptian deity served as the first surrogate mother; that out of this fantastic occurrence the basic religious concept of baptism as purification was born, along with the concepts of virgin birth and immaculate conception, and that this unique occasion is represented in the symbol we all have come to accept as the symbol of medicine, the Caduceus (Figure 1). First, let us examine the biological evidence. Scientists theorize that multicellular organisms arose eons ago through the inter- dependency of different organisms, a process called symbiosis. One such symbiont resulted in the modem organelle called the mito- chondrion. The organelle is the power generator of the cell, pro- ducing energy in the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In plants, the chloroplast is believed to have originated in a similar manner as the mitochondrion (Stanier, Doudoroff, &amp; Adelberg, 1963). The mitochondrion acts semiautonomously within the cell: It has its own genetic material (DNA), which replicates independently of the nuclear DNA (Baskin &amp; Yang, 1981). In sexual reproduction it is the female egg that transmits the mitochondrion from parent to offspring. The interrelatedness of DNA among a population of organisms from bacteria to man has been used as a proof of genetic identity. Consequently, a comparison of mitochondrial DNA among women of different racial groups can be an indicator of their genetic relatedness. This technique has been used to classify a variety of animal life and is an accepted scientific tool. Imagine, then, the implications of the announcement from a group of scientists, based on the study of mitochondrial DNA, that all of humanity arose from a single African female about 200,000 years ago (Cann, Stoneking, &amp; Wilson, 1987). This controversial idea will seem preposterous to those scientists who hold the view that modern man evolved from the archaic hominid, homo erectus, in different locales, rather than in a specific location in Africa.</page><page sequence="3">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 595 Figure 1: The Caduceus (Staff of Thoth/Hermes/Mercury) Yet if we accept the "Eve" theory proposed by modem scientists, we have a basis for reconciling the protracted feud between science and religion. But in order to do this we have to look at certain ancient mythologies in a new light. The mythological has often become synonymous with the imaginary tales of a culture formulated to explain natural forces beyond its comprehension, or as Campbell (1988) observes, that myths not only offer life's models but "are metaphors of spiritual potentiality in the human being" (p. 22). Mythical tales are often outside the realm of contemporary experi- ence, and this fact helps to reinforce or confirm their imaginary nature. For example, the longevity of certain biblical patriarchs</page><page sequence="4">596 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 such as Noah or Methuselah is considered legendary or mytholog- ical, because this life span is outside our contemporary experience. According to Newell (1982), "The poetic story of Noah and his Ark is now regarded by thoughtful people as allegory." However, Homer's Troy was considered mythological, until this city was discovered in 1870 by Heinrich Schlieman. Myths, then, are generally a collection of stories so classified to fit into our experiences, but that classification may be revised as more data emerge to verify the myths as factual. I share Churchward's (1924) observation: Primitive man has been portrayed in modem times as if he were a philosophical theorist. He has been charged with imagining all sorts of things which never existed; as if that were the origin of his Spirit and his Gods; whereas the beginning was with the elemental pow- ers. These were external to himself. There was no need to imagine them. They were, and with this cognition his Theology began. (p. 7) Actuality was earlier than Tpology, and the elements of life them- selves, as the objects of recognition were earlier than the Zootypes, as for instance, Earth, Air, Wind, Rain, Vegetables, etc. which became Totems without being, as it were, first in types of Mythol- ogy. (p. 18) In other words, reality precedes mythology, or stated differently, physical reality precedes philosophical constructs. Bearing this in mind, let us look again at some Mesopotamian and Egyptian myths that support the Eve theory. Why limit our- selves only to these versions of creation? The fact is that there are hundreds of creation stories from different cultures around the world, but these two ancient cultures produced remarkable civili- zations that are somehow precursors of our own. In Book of Beginnings, first published in 1881, years before Leakey made his groundbreaking discoveries in the Olduvai Gorge of central Africa, Gerald Massey stated that the Egyptians of antiquity held that mankind arose in three stages covering a period of 36,525 years: "The first series of princes was that of the Auritae, the second was that of the Mestraeans, the third of the Egyptians." Massey examined the etymology of Auritae and Mestraeans, dem-</page><page sequence="5">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 597 onstrating the "polyphony of meaning" common to the Egyptian language (Frankfort, 1948). He concluded: Ruti = the Egyptian race of men par excellence Au = was Au-rut = the race that was Au = Af = Kaf = black, dog-headed, almost human monkey Therefore Kaf-ruti is to Ruti, as apes and pre-man are to man. Mest = birthplace, the lying in chamber, to be born Ru = gate or gorge of outlet Ruen = gorge of a valley The Mestraeans, therefore, were the "people of the gorge" or "people whose birthplace was in the gorge of a valley." One does not have to use much imagination to see here an astounding parallel to current archeological evidence: Were the Mestraeans the homo erectus of the Olduvai gorge, while the Auritae were the apeman homo habilis? Although at this time the Egyptian time span of 36,000 years, as interpreted by Massey, is inadequate to account for the progression of homo habilis to homo sapiens sapiens, the etymology of their terms would indicate that the Egyptians were aware of the principle of evolution, and furthermore insisted that they were created from the Mestraeans. The Egyptians called their land Kemet or KMT, meaning "the Black Lands" or "Land of the Blacks." In Book of Beginnings, Massey (1881) provides further examples of the "polyphony of meaning": K4M = Black land, create, chemistry Khemt = the Southern Land, inner land, the feminine abode, the birthplace, the lake country One may conclude, then, that Kemet is a metaphor for "Land of the Blacks created through chemistry in the lake country." As the Egyptians themselves recorded: "We came from the beginning of</page><page sequence="6">598 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 the Nile, where God Hapi dwells, at the foothills of the Mountain of the Moon" (Papyrus of Hunefer). Throughout different cultures, the same mythological themes recur, themes such as creation, death, resurrection, and virgin birth, with differences due only to cultural inflections (Campbell, 1988). For example, the Egyptian goddess, Hathor, is often depicted as a cow or as a cow-headed deity (Figure 2). Along the Nile are several temples dedicated to Hathor to celebrate virgin birth and immacu- late conception (ben-Jochannan, 1990). Associated with these tem- ples are houses of birth: These houses of birth are interesting from the architectural standpoint.... At Edfu the capitals [molded decorations at the top of the columns] are in the shape of bunches of plants, and above them the special elements are like dice, on which are shown the figures of Bes, the protector god of women during confinement [childbirth] . . . in other houses of birth in place of the figure of Bes there are sometimes heads of Hathor. (Lange &amp; Hirmer, 1968, p. 526) The Mesopotamian equivalent to these houses of birth was proba- bly none other than the House of Shimti, a term Sitchin (1976) has shown in The Twelfth Planet to mean literally "the house where the wind of life is breathed in." Hathor was associated with surrogate motherhood by the ancient Egyptians (ben-Jochannan, 1990). The temple at Dendera, dedi- cated to her, was to celebrate virgin birth and immaculate concep- tion. The temple at Philae, dedicated to Hathor, was also to celebrate virgin birth and immaculate conception. At this temple was also practiced the purification of the pharaoh, a ceremony considered to be a prototype of baptism. The temple of Dendur, which is also associated with Hathor, can be seen in its entirety at the Metropol- itan Museum of Art in New York City. The medical symbol is displayed on either side of the entry doors. At Kom Ombo, also on the Nile, is a double temple dedicated to Suchos and Horus. Here can be seen the best example of baptism. The medical symbol is also displayed there, and the temple once contained ancient medical instruments very similar to those used today.</page><page sequence="7">1, Figure 2: A Depiction of the Egyptian Goddess Hathor</page><page sequence="8">600 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 Why was Hathor associated with surrogate motherhood, a fan- tastic concept in such remote times? Why were temples dedicated to her to celebrate the unique concepts of virgin birth and immac- ulate conception? Why is baptism associated with these concepts? Consider this: Massey (1881) states that Khartoum, a country below the first cataract of the Nile, may be interpreted as follows: Kart = child um = to perceive Khartoum, he concluded, was "the place where the birth of the child was first perceived." The Mesopotamian creation stories not only closely parallel the Egyptian, but they add to them. The Mesopotamian Atra-Hasis epic, When the Gods, Like Men, Bore the Work (Lambert &amp; Millard, 1969), elaborates on the events that led up to the creation of man. Zecharia Sitchin (1976) presents a revolutionary translation and interpretation of some of these epics. The following is a summary as presented by Sitchin in The Twelfth Planet, the first volume of The Earth Chronicles. The Nefilim (mentioned in Genesis 6:4 in the Jerusalem Bible and in other modem translations) were on Earth in the distant past to obtain gold to save the depleting atmosphere of their home planet, Marduk, a distant member of our solar system. The workers, called Annunaki, rebelled at the hard labor involved. To find a substitute for the rebellious workers, Enki (Sumerian for the Egyptian god, Ptah), the god of science and knowledge, and his chief medical officer Ninhursag (Sumerian for the Egyptian goddess Hathor) realized after several experiments and failures that a primitive being existed in the country south of Egypt which could be modified biologically to do the work for the Annunaki (Sitchin, 1976): The creature whose name you uttered.... It exists!.......... Bind upon it the image of the gods.... (p. 341) This is very similar to Genesis 1:26: "And Elohim said, Let us make Man in our image after our likeness." Selecting a young Nefilim to be donor of blood, Enki proclaimed (Sitchin, 1976):</page><page sequence="9">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 601 I will prepare a purifying bath, Let one god be bled..... From his flesh and blood Let Ninti mix the clay.. (p. 351) Out of his blood they fashioned Mankind; Imposed on it the service, let free the gods... It was a work beyond comprehension. (p. 350) Ninti is an appellation for Ninhursag (Hathor), while clay, with a double meaning of dirt or earthling, was a metaphor for "the earthling," our ancestral Eve (Sitchin, 1976). These prebiblical creation myths are the sophisticated stories of a highly developed group of beings, describing technology unique to man until only a few years ago. These stories do not describe supernatural or mys- tical events, as some scholars would have us believe based on the Genesis version. Indeed, Sitchin (1976) observes that Genesis is but a synopsis of these lengthier stories. In fact, Alter (1981) contends that "historicized prose fiction" is the basic way to de- scribe the style of biblical narrative. The author of Genesis, Sitchin (1976) believes, sought to abbreviate and to attribute to one god events that occurred over many years and that required cooperative efforts of several key individuals called gods in the creation of man. Notice that the enigmatic Elohim as used in Genesis is plural. In the third volume of his Earth Chronicles, The Wars of Gods and Men, Sitchin (1985) shows the causes of events on Earth that led up to the historical moment when one god was proclaimed supreme on Earth. Abraham, a key human actor in this ancient drama, bestowed on the Hebrews the historical legacy of the Sumerians after their demise, but now presumably, under the aus- pices of the newly installed supreme deity. The historical nature of this event is also documented in Egyptian history: The Pharaoh Amenophis IV about 1370 B.C. sought to impose this new concept of one god on the Egyptian people (Lichtheim, 1976). Amenophis IV was the chief patron of the paramount Egyptian god, Amen-Ra, as the name Amen-ophis implies. Amen-Ra, whose Babylonian appellation was Marduk, was the god who aspired to the supreme deity (Sitchin, 1985). It was either to commemorate or to signify this ascension that Amenophis IV changed his name accordingly</page><page sequence="10">602 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 to Akenaton. In fact, it can be shown in documents from the royal archives found in the ruins of El Armana that the pharaohs Amenophis III and IV communicated in Akkadian with Asiatic rulers. Lichtheim (1976) observes that this was a time when the scribes who ran the administration prided themselves on their knowledge of foreign places and peoples. The epics that describe the war for supremacy tell of the destruc- tion in Mesopotamia of "seven cities of the plain," cities whose populations were followers of Marduk. These cities included the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah. The aftermath of the destruction of the cities led to the formation of a unique deadly "evil wind," which devastated Sumer (Sitchin, 1985): On the Land fell a calamity, One unknown to man: One that had never been seen before, One which could not be withstood. . . (p. 336) The cities in Mesopotamia were wiped out by the evil wind, "bear- ing gloom from city to city, carrying dense clouds that bring gloom from the sky" (Sitchin, 1985, p. 337). It would be interesting to determine if one of the seven cities included the lost Mesopotamian city of Mashkan-Shapir. This city was recently discovered in present-day Iraq by archeologist Elizabeth Stone of the State University of New York. She notes in a recent newspaper article (Philadelphia Inquirer, March 26, 1989, p. A6) written by Charles Rodin of the Boston Globe that there was a single moment when everyone in this city ran away, leaving all their possessions behind them. She observes that they didn't leave in an orderly manner, so one can expect that a lot of their posses- sions are still there. Compare Stone's views with those of the ancient author of the Uruk Lamentation text: "loyal citizens of Uruk were seized with terror ... Rise up! run away, hide in the steppes . . . the deities ran off ... they took unfamiliar paths" (cited in Sitchin, 1985). The text describes terror and confusion among the citizens of Uruk. They were instructed to vacate the city forthwith and to leave their possessions behind (Sitchin, 1985, p. 339).</page><page sequence="11">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 603 These circumstances closely parallel the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, in that Lot and his family were instructed to leave the city immediately because it was about to be destroyed by fire and brimstone: "Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be con- sumed" (Genesis 19:17). Lot's wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt. Sitchin (1985), however, shows that in Sumerian the words for vapor and salt are identical, so that the translation could just as well be "pillar of vapor" as in the Erra (Nergal, "The Scorcher") epic where the god proclaimed: The people I will make vanish, Their souls shall turn to vapor. (p. 314) The conflict, according to the Sumerian version, was waged with "seven awesome weapons." It is interesting to note that the city of Mashkan-Shapir was officially dedicated to the god Nergal ("The Scorcher"), a bitter enemy of Marduk. Marduk's increasing popu- larity in Mesopotamia was the basis for its destruction. For an extensive examination of these events see Sitchin's (1985) The Wars of Gods and Men. Further support for the Eve hypothesis is seen in Egyptian art. The ancient Egyptians often depicted their men with a dark red color and their females with a yellow color. Some scholars believe that the red color symbolically represented man as "the blood of life." According to Wallis Budge (1973), the blood represents life. He notes that the earliest Egyptians painted their bodies with a red pigment, a practice he also noted among central Africans. As the Sumerian epics describe the creation of man from the mixing of a god's blood with the clay of the Abzu (somewhere south of Egypt), so did the ancient Egyptians use the red clay on their bodies to symbolize this belief. It has been observed that the belief in survival after death can be demonstrated from the earliest times by the universal use of red ochre as a ritual substitute for blood, a symbol of life (Eliade, 1978). As Sitchin (1976) points out in The Twelfth Planet, the Hebrew term adama (after which the name Adam was coined) originally meant dark-red soil, and that the word for the</page><page sequence="12">604 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 color red, adom (Hebrew) and adama stem from the words for blood: adamu, dam. He concluded that "the Adam" could mean "the one of the Earth" (earthling), "the one made of the dark-red soil," and "the one made of blood." The yellow color is generally regarded as symbolic of fertility. The fertility of the earth, according to Eliade (1978), is bound up with feminine fecundity. He notes that woman becomes responsible for the abundance of harvests, for she knows the "mystery" of creation. Because of the association of the yellow color with agriculture, one may assume that it was intended to be a metaphor for sunlight. However, I suggest that perhaps it is derived from a more subtle biological source. If the first Adamu was a sterile genetic hybrid, then this fact should also be alluded to in the ancient myths. Indeed the Mesopo- tamian text "When Gods, Like Men" includes an account of the mass production of these new creatures in the House of Shimti, where the breath of life is "blown" in (Sitchin, 1976): The god who purifies the Napishtu, Ea, spoke up. Seated before her, he was prompting her. After she had recited her incantation, She put her hand out to the clay. Ninti nipped off fourteen pieces of clay; Seven she deposited on the right, Seven she deposited on the left. Between them she placed the mould. ... the hair she.... ... the cutter of the umbilical cord. (p. 354) Ninhursag (Ninti, Hathor), using the services of 14 surrogate moth- ers, proceeded to mass-produce man: The birth goddesses were kept together. Ninti sat counting the months. The fateful 10th month was approaching; The 10th month arrived; The period of opening the womb had elapsed. Her face radiated understanding: She covered her head, performed the midwifery.</page><page sequence="13">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 605 Her waist she girdled, pronounced the blessing. She drew a shape; in the mould was life. (pp. 354-355) The demand for the new creature outpaced the production tech- nique, and Ea (Enki) had to devise a solution to the infertility problem. It is at this juncture that the allegorical "Tree of Knowl- edge" comes into play. In many of the ancient depictions of cre- ation, an enigmatic Tree of Life is a prominent part of the scene. That the eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge bore a sexual connotation has been advocated by various authors through the ages, and that "the knowing," therefore, was one of "sexual know- ing." I contend that this Tree of Life or Tree of Knowledge is the prototype for the fertility metaphor, yellow; and that this yellow is probably derived from none other than what Eigsti and Dustin (1955) believed to be "one of the saffron plants of the [Ebers] Papyrus": Colchicum. Colchicum belongs to the Lillium family and obtained its name from Colchis on the Eastern tip of the Black Sea, where it was found in abundance (Eigsti &amp; Dustin, 1955). Colchis was where Herodotus surmised that Egypt had established a colony in antiquity because the Colchicians, like the Egyptians, had Black skin and wooly hair. Colchis was also where the mythical Greek heroes Jason and the Argonauts secured the Golden Fleece (Bulfinch, 1942). From Colchicum is derived the mitogenic poison, colchicine, which has the interesting property of inducing metaphasic arrest during nuclear mitosis. This results in a multiplication of the chromosome number (polyploidy) in the treated cells. In other words, colchicine is poisonous to growing cells by interfering with the normal completion of the cell cycle, thereby causing it to cease in metaphase. This important property of colchicine is used by modern botanists to create fertile crosses between different species of plants that have uneven chromosome numbers and so overcome the problem of infertile hybrids (Eigsti &amp; Dustin, 1955). Wheat, one of the world's most important cash crops, supposedly devel- oped naturally through interspecies hybridization followed by chro-</page><page sequence="14">606 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 mosome doubling (Eigsti &amp; Dustin, 1955). Cataclysmic evolution is the term used to describe this type of sudden development. Because colchicine crystals are yellow, and because saffron is also obtained from the Colchicum plant, I suggest that this may be the original source for the use of yellow as a fertility symbol: whereas most hybrids are sterile, colchicine makes hybrids fertile. The biblical connections are seen in the allegorical story of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden: enticed by the snake (Ea/Enki), Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and became aware of their nakedness (sexuality). An amazing coincidence is the fact that a common name for Colchicum is "naked ladies" (Eigsti &amp; Dustin, 1955, p. 7). Connections are also seen in the enigmatic verse "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were compatible and took them as wives" (Genesis 6:1-2). I believe that Colchicum was the prototype plant of the Tree of Life/Knowledge and that the connection of plant and fertility was later modified by cultural inflections so that the date palm and the papyrus became substitutes in their particular cultures. Frankfort (1948) notes that Hathor was worshipped in trees in remote times and is often depicted as a cow in a cluster of papyrus (Figure 2b), and that this connection between Hathor and trees, although very old, has always been a puzzle to scholars. Although the use of colchicine in horticulture has been quite successful, its use in zoology or on vertebrate cells creates unpre- dictable results. Modem zoological experiments have resulted in the production of deformities in some animal species (Eigsti &amp; Dustin, 1955). Not surprisingly, a parallel observation is noted in Mesopotamian myths, where in their efforts to create the perfect Adamu, Enki and Ninhursag (Hathor) produced a variety of beings that suffered from a catalogue of deformities and malformations (Sitchin, 1976). If man's predecessors, the Mestraeans (according to the ancient Egyptians), originated in the lake country, an area of the Great Rift Valley in Africa, then local legends and cultures may provide some historical memory of such a claim. A cursory glance shows that this</page><page sequence="15">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 607 is indeed so. The Masai of East Africa are one of the ethnic groups which have incorporated in their everyday culture at least some of the symbolisms associated with the creation of man. They use red ochre for adorning their bodies, they are caretakers of cattle (sym- bolic of the cow goddess Hathor), and they hold that their creator was Enkai (Masai). Even as Enki's (Sumerian) symbol was the snake or serpent, the Masai hold the snake in reverence. The Masai legend states that their first laibon or seer was given a magical box called the Enkidong. The main purpose of the Enkidong was to direct and guide the Masai warriors during times of war and peace (Huntingford, 1973; Sankan, n.d.). This instrument is the direct equivalent of the Hebrew Ark of the Covenant, a device with which Jahweh was to communicate with the high priest: "And I will communicate with thee from above the mercy seat" situated be- tween two golden archangels facing each other with outstretched wings (Exodus 25:22). Were the Masai chosen to give testimony to the origin of man? Enki was called the "Massil" of the gods, but scholars are unable to render its meaning. However, the verb masu means "to forget," as it appears in lines 214-217 of the Atra-Hasis text (Lambert &amp; Millard, 1969): So that we may hear the drum for the rest of time Let there be a spirit from the god's flesh. Let it proclaim a living (man) as its sign, So that this be not forgotten let there be a spirit. (p. 59) I believe that it is in this sense that Massii probably should be interpreted, so that the Masai were to be living memories of Enki's handiwork. The ancient Egyptians chose animals to represent certain char- acteristics or functions of certain gods, a practice that is called totemism. I believe the following interpretations can be applied to some of these Egyptian totems: Anubis, god of the dead, is symbol- ically protrayed as a jackal because this animal is a scavenger of dead animals. Horus was portrayed as a falcon after he defeated Seth in an aerial battle for the kingship of a unified Egypt, because -as a falcon hunts from the sky, so did Horus hunt Seth in his flying machine, the Nar (Fiery Pillar). In fact, the name of the founding</page><page sequence="16">608 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 father of unified Egypt, Narmer, is comprised of the two objects the Nar and the Mer as seen on the Narmer palette, Figure 3a (David- son, 1962, pp. 40-41). Figure 3b shows a detailed sketch of this cylindrical Nar with its two eyes, which could change color from blue to red and back to blue (Sitchin, 1985). Seth, having lost the battle, left Egypt, depicted as an Asiatic ass. Thoth (Hermes, Mercury), the god of medicine and also "the scribe of the gods," was depicted as an ibis, a bird whose long beak is suggestive of a writing instrument. Hathor was depicted as a cow (Figure 2), because she was considered a surrogate mother or "wet nurse" for mankind: as a cow provides milk for nourishment, so did Hathor nurture the newly created man called the Adamu, meaning literally the earthling. Enki's symbol was the serpent entwined on a staff, not because he was a devil, but because of the manner in which he created mankind: by genetic engineering. The shape of the serpent, one of nature's best examples of the alpha helix structure, was chosen to sym- bolize the DNA double helix (Figure 4). Compare this structure to the Caduceus and see the similarity! Therefore, it is of major significance that the temples dedicated to Hathor all display the Caduceus (Figure 1), the double serpent entwined on a staff topped with a winged globe. Later, this symbol was appropriately assigned to Thoth as the god of medicine, because, as it was implied then in antiquity, most if not all diseases can be traced back to the level of the gene; this observation is now confirmed by modem science. The Caduceus is a symbolic representation of the DNA double helix, designed on the same principles as other Egyptian totems. As Sitchin (1985) points out in The Wars of Gods and Men,Nahash (original Hebrew) = Serpent, or literally "He who solves secretes" or "He who knows metals" (p. 108). In Sumerian: *-. (Enki's appellation) where * = god, and -. = BUR, BURU, BUZUR = god who solves secrets; god of the deep mines (Sitchin, ,a985, p. 107). As further evidence for the great antiquity of this symbol, Churchward (1912) has shown the existence of a variant (T) that extends as far back as to the Twa people (the so-called pygmies) of Africa. The Twa, who he believes to be the oldest form of homo sapiens originating in the lake country of the Great Rift Valley, held</page><page sequence="17">Forbes / MITOCHONDRLAL EVE 609 V V a b Figure 3: A Depiction of the Nar or Fiery Pillar as It Appears on the Narmer Palette (a) and in Detail (b)</page><page sequence="18">610 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1992 Figure 4: The DNA Double Helix this symbol as their most sacred; it meant "the one great spirit." In contemporary times, the secret of heredity was solved with the elucidation, by Watson and Crick (1 953), of the DNA double helix. Incidently, the serpent symbol originating with Ea (Enki, Ptah) became the primary symbol of the subsequent human rulers of</page><page sequence="19">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 611 Egypt. The deified serpent symbol and its variants, therefore, may serve as a cultural marker to determine the influence of Africa on world cultures in antiquity, as one need only to follow the trail of the serpent: from Quatzecoatl, the feathered serpent of pre-Columbian America, to the Druids of Ireland and England, to the dragons of China and the rest of Asia. In the Americas, a pre-Columbian depiction of the creation story shows the biological basis of this act (Figure 5b). Here a female, giving birth to mankind, is represented in a stylized form as a laboratory flask. The ingredients being added to the flask by two gods, a male and a female, are astonishing. With very little imagi- nation, one can see, in this very stylized artist's depiction, spermlike symbols represented as arrows being added by the male god to round beadlike objects suggestive of the female egg added by the goddess, while man, the finished product, emerges from the flask, but actually from between her legs (Sitchin, 1990). Could it be that this is also one of the earliest depictions of male and female symbols: ox and9, where -. represents the sperm and o represents the female egg? That actual laboratory flasks may have been used in the creation of man is suggested from a Sumerian cylinder seal (Figure 5a). Here we see a goddess holding the newly created man in the presence of two assistants. Notice the laboratory-like flasks and the Tree of Life prominently displayed in the background (Sitchin, 1976). Clues to the physical identity of Eve and the young Nefilim who served as the male donor of genetic material, probably spermatozoa, can be deduced from the nature of the fertility symbols of antiquity. The young Nefilim is probably none other than the Egyptian god Min, who was depicted as an individual with an obviously erect penis and who was revered as a symbol of fertility; in antiquity, phallic symbols have always been associated with fertility. Was Min the young Nefilim We-ila of the Atra-Hasis text (Lambert &amp; Millard, 1969), who was "bled" to provide the essence to create man? The clay or earthling is represented by one of the so-called Venus figures, such as the "Venus of Willendorf" (Figure 6). As with phallic cults, these Venus figurines, found throughout the world, are recognized today as fertility symbols of antiquity.

On the Nile at Phylae is one of the best examples of baptism. Here also was where the purification of the pharaoh occurred. I sug- gest that baptism as purification is a symbolic act to commemorate the purifying and aseptic conditions that are essential for the act of in vitro fertilization, which produced the first test-tube baby, Man; that is why Enki proclaimed, "I will prepare a purifying bath, let one god be bled." The implantation of the fertilized egg into the womb of Enki's spouse, Ninki, made her the first surrogate mother, and because this conception was without the direct involvement of sexual intercourse, we have the prototype of immaculate concep- tion and virgin birth. The concept of virgin birth may also be derived from the fact that the Adamu did not emerge from the vagina as in a normal birth, but instead the ancient epic describes what today would be considered a Cesarean section: The Lady Whose Hand Opens came, With the.... she opened the womb... That which was in the womb came forth. (Sitchin, 1976, p. 355) It was to commemorate this "work beyond comprehension" that the original temples were constructed, from Khartoum, "where the child was first perceived," to the Temple of Luxor, where we can see even today the annunciation, birth, and adoration of the child: Homo sapiens sapiens! The misreading of mythology on which theology was founded, has created confusion everywhere; it has obscured the past, perplexed the present, beclouded the future, converted all scientific truth into religious falsehood, and made chaos in the moral domain look like the only permanent institution in creation. (Massey, 1881, p. 185) The misreading of mythology to which Massey alludes is due to the fact that theology has substituted metaphor for reality: Adam = the earthling Clay = the egg from primitive earth female homo erectus</page><page sequence="23">Forbes / MITOCHONDRIAL EVE 615 The "fruit of the tree" = sexual reproduction facilitated by a plant extract The snake or serpent = genetic material, the DNA double helix Virgin birth = birth directly removed from the womb Immaculate conception = in vitro fertilization followed by implanta- tion into the womb Baptism = the purifying bath of asepsis needed for in vitro fertilization If these observations are correct, then there really is no conflict between science and religion, because it is the habit of scientists to speak of nature methaphorically, whereas it is the nature of theolo- gians to see metaphor as reality.
