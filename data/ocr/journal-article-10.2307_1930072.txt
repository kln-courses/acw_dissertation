<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELATION OF GENERAL ECOLOGY TO HUMAN ECOLOGY1 CHARLES C. ADAMS New York State Museum, Albany, N. Y. THE GENERAL BACKGROUND "Our coordinated knowledge which in the general sense of the term is Science, is formed by the meeting of two orders of experience. One order is constituted by the direct, immediate discriminations of particular observa- tions. The other order is constituted by our general way of conceiving the Universe. They will be called, the Observational Order, and the Concep- tual Order. The first point to remember is that the observational order is invariably interpreted in terms of the concepts supplied by the conceptual order. . . . We inherit an observational order, namely types of things which we do in fact discriminate; and we inherit a conceptual order, namely a rough system of ideas in terms of which we do in fact, interpret." (Alfred N. Whitehead. "Adventures of Ideas," p. 198. 1933.) It is generally difficult to estimate relative values, and yet the effort must be made if science is to advance. The progress made in ecology, both plant and animal, during the past third of a century appears to be of epoch-making importance. This may not be evident at a glance, but there is considerable evidence which supports this opinion. The present paper is devoted primarily to discussion of the general methods of studying ecology. Progress may be measured either by the acquisition of new observational facts, or by new ideas and generalizations, as Whitehead has indicated. In this connection let us recall the work of Darwin and Wallace. In spite of the vast number of facts discovered by these great naturalists, their greatest contribution was their method of interpreting thefactsfrom a genetic or process viewpoint. By means of their critical and analytical studies, supplemented by their constructive imagination, they were able to make such important and original hypotheses that their generalizations have dominated the minds of the scientific world for 75 years. It is thus seen that scientific advances depend upon the discovery of objective facts and subjective concepts, and that both kinds of discoveries are of the utmost importance; and finally we should bear in mind the fact that nothing is gained by belittling or minimizing the influence of either. Taxonomic, floral and faunal methods of study have developed somewhat in advance of the ecological, and just as the older non-genetic taxonomy paved the way for the species problem and modern taxonomy based on 1 The author wishes to express his appreciation for valuable criticisms made during the preparation of this paper to the following: Dr. William S. Cooper, Dr. Wallace Craig, and to Dr. Robert D. Glasgow. 31i6</page><page sequence="2">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 3I7 descent, so the older floral and faunal studies were transformed under the influence of the evolutionary concepts and thus they became increasingly genetic. There also always remains in ecological studies a hereditary or genetic factor. We should also recall that ecologic field study and genetic faunal studies were a vital influence in the greatest discoveries made by both Darwin and Wallace. There has developed during this recent period very great progress in the physical and chemical means of analyzing biological problems. This was no doubt closely related to the refinements of our scientific and technical industrial advances. This has been the period during which microscopic technique dominated our laboratories to such a degree that the conception of the life of the plant and animal as a whole was almost, if not completely lost sight of, and direct contact with these organisms in their field relations was sadly neglected. During this period the laboratory training of the urban universities and colleges tended generally to ignore the relation of living plants and animals to natural conditions. Most of the students at the sea-side laboratories retained this indoor attitude. Students with such a background were generally not interested in outdoor studies, live organisms, or ecological research, and often they found it impossible to adapt themselves either to the theoretical aspects or to ecological field study. Many of the leading colleges and universities even today remain in this stage of develop- ment, almost harking back to the days when Latin and Greek were the universal college entrance requirements, and illustrating what the sociologists call "cultural lag," and the ecologists call "relic" conditions. Another dominating influence during this period has been the rediscovery of Mendel's study of heredity. Following this came the work of Bateson, De Vries, Morgan and others, initiating one of the most rapid advances in the history of biology. The results of this brilliant period have so over- shadowed many other lines of study as to obscure the perspective, and even now it is difficult to evaluate thoroughly its contribution to general biology and to ecology. However, some students like Jennings ('24, '25, '30), express certain opinions that are quite significant from an ecological point of view. Thus this author states ('24, p. 225) :" Organisms are like other objects in this respect; what they do or become depends both on what they are made of, and on the conditions surrounding them. The dependence on what they are originally made of we call heredity. But no single thing that the organism does depends alone on heredity or alone on environment; always both have to be taken into account. . . . (Page 233.) But the fruit flies in the laboratory usually live in moist air; this inheritance appears under those conditions. If they are hatched and live under dry conditions the abnormality doesn't appear even in those daughters which indubitably inherit it. Clearly, it is not necessary to have a characteristic merely be- cause one inherits it. Or more properly, characteristics are not inherited at all; what one inherits is certain material that under certain conditions</page><page sequence="3">3i8 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 will produce a particular characteristic; if those conditions are not supplied some other characteristic is produced." Such statements as the above indicate that the discoveries and the literature of ecological significance are by no means limited to the journals or serials devoted to ecology, and show that the ecologist must forage over the whole field of biology and the allied sciences for his significant facts and inferences, and much of value will be found in rather unexpected places. It is of interest to observe that some students of heredity apparently do not see the ecological and environmental significance of their own results. Our knowledge of the general physiology of plants and animals, including their behavior and habits, has progressed as never before. The refinements of physics and chemistry have revolutionized the general conceptions of physiology, and as a result both plant and animal physiology and behavior have been largely rewritten. Our understanding of the functions of plants and animals as individual entities or unit systems has advanced to a higher recognized standing, and is coming to be more clearly accepted as subjects worthy of serious study. Individuality is coming to be considered as both a condition and a product of creative ability. The community behavior of plants and animals will probably next receive a clearer recognition, and appropriate study, and this advance will pave the way for a better under- standing of human social relations. Our knowledge of the gross physical environment has also advanced by great strides. The progress in dynamic climatology, physiography, regional geography and exploration, geological history, human geography, as well as in the dynamic study of economics and sociology, have all con- tributed generalizations and facts that are of great value for ecological advance. Modern geography has a very distinctly ecological slant, and it is no longer a rare event to find the word ecology in geographic, economic and sociological literature. We thus see that the recent important advances in ecology have been along descriptive, dynamic, functional, experimental and genetic lines, and that not only has there been an extensive accumulation of new facts, but also as well, a considerable increase in new generalizations, and that much definite integration has taken place between the allied sciences. The newer studies of heredity have made important contributions to the relative influence and meaning of heredity and the environment; the advances in physiology and behavior, as well as anatomical progress, have also contributed to this general movement. The advances in taxonomy have promoted both floral and faunal studies and have given them a richer genetic interpretation, and upon such a broad foundation modern plant and animal ecology has ex- panded, bringing out the deeper significance of biotic communities, which suggests that such studies will periodically contribute much toward a better foundation for an understanding of human economics, and social and govern- mental problems.</page><page sequence="4">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 319 DYNAMIC AND PROCESS VIEWPOINT "Constructive and destructive agencies can be recognized only when the phenomena are made the basis of the scheme. Processes are merely opera- tive. If coupled with the products at all, in classification, all must be regarded as formative or constructive. The product's destruction, its loss of identity, is wholly immaterial. The action of agencies is merely to produce constant change. A truly genetic scheme for the classification of natural phenomena thus always has prominently presented its underlying principle of cause and effect. All products must find accurate expression in terms of the agencies." (Keyes. 1898, p. 812.) "But in the development of modern physics and chemistry, the same thing is now happening to the physicists. Regarded from this standpoint, it is no longer merely living beings, but the whole of nature which has become an architectonic structure, the richer and the more complex the more it is investigated by science. It is science which has created our conception of this architecture, and its extension from the living into the inorganic world makes the whole structure not less, but still more wonderful. From this point of view, the word organization is a biological expression for the same thing as is known to physics and chemistry as a system." (Johan Hjort, "The Unity of Science," pp. 164-165.) The ramifications of ecological relations are so varied that a considerable number of general ideas adapted from the allied sciences are constantly being developed and should be utilized. To mention them would be to summarize the status of the useful generalizations in the related sciences. However, when we consider the present status of ecology some of these generalizations are apparently of more immediate interest and value than others, and there- fore only a few will be selected for brief mention. The dynamic and process point of view is a generalization that has been of relatively slow growth. It has been spreading gradually in the biological sciences and has made rather rapid progress in some aspects of ecology. I have discussed various phases of this subject in relation to the dynamics of habitats and migrations, and to biotic or climax centers rather frequently (Adams '01, '02, '02a, '04, '05, '06, '08, '09; '13, '15, '15a, '15b, '18-'19), and important revisions and qualifications are now much needed because of recent advances (cf. Lotka '25). Cooper ('26) has discussed certain dynamic aspects of plant ecology more fully than other authors, and special attention is called to his important paper. Of course a large number of students have emphasized various phases of this subject, but in general the clearest ex- pression of these general ideas have come from the students of the physical and earth sciences (Keyes, '98; Van Hise, '04), and more recently from the ecologists, physiologists, and others. Some physiologists have accepted the ecological ideas and terminology of dominance, zonation and gradients. Fundamentally this means that we are dealing with the causes and laws of change in the environment and in organisms, distinguishing the energies involved, the activity of the agents or the systems, their dynamic status, their relative optima, limiting factors, and the orderly sequence or succession of their internal and external changes (Adams, '13, '15, '18-'19).</page><page sequence="5">320 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No.3 It should be evident that field work as well as experimental studies may be made more fruitful by the use of such ideas. These ideas should be considered in the same light as other tools, both those of the field and of the laboratory, for they are in reality mental tools. Like other tools they may become dulled, useless or outgrown, and should then be discarded. Skill in the use of ideas varies also as does skill with other tools; some have dexterity, some mechanical skill, others have theoretical skill, but rarely is one person gifted with the use of all. These tools, like the student himself, have their limitations, and the practical problem is to make the best use of all facilities that are available under the circumstances. In cases where the causes are obscure, attention should be concentrated on the activity of the agent or the system, its processes and cycles of activity should be determined, as well as its dynamic status (Adams, '18-'19, pp. 470-477, and "Reports of the Conferences on Cycles," Carnegie Inst. of Washington, 1929). As I have said elsewhere (Adams, '18-'19, p. 471), "The dynamic status means the condition of a unit or system with regard to its degree of relative equilibrium. The cycle of change may be considered to begin at any point. I have taken as the initial stage of the cycle the condition of stress and pressure and have indicated how this condition tends to change in response to pressure, bringing about the process of adjustment to strain, and leading to the condition of adjustment to strain, or that of relative equilibrium. The activity of the agent produces the condition of stress, the process of adjustment to the strain follows, and this leads to the product-the establishment of the condition of adjustment or of relative equilibrium." These ideas apply to the life cycle, and to development and possibly to the race. In the light of recent interpretation of Jennings ('24, '25, '30) it seems that Vernon's law (Vernon, '03, p. 199) with regard to the progressively diminishing influence of the environment after the impregnation of the egg, will have to be modified. The activities of plants and animals as agents or systems, because of their active lives, are continually colliding with the environment or are bom- barded by the environment. This is the basis for the friction and interaction between the organism and the environment. Fortunately, in recent years a comprehensive study has been made of several of these physical conceptions by Lotka ('25) as well as by others, and special attention is called to his volume, because it contains valuable discussions and criticisms of the earlier work, including equilibria, the principle of Le Chatelier, Bancroft's law (Bancroft, '11), and related ideas. His discussion of the applications and limitations of physical changes, in relation to biological problems, is quite illuminating. (See also Pike, '23; Wardlaw, '32.) Today there is urgent need for a similar evaluation of the so-called "optimum," and "limiting factors," including Liebig's law of the minimum and its various modifica- tions, and the law of diminishing returns (Spillman and Lang, '24; Black, pp. 635-644, in Rice, '31; and Willcox, '30). See also Blackman,</page><page sequence="6">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 32I '05, '08; Blackman and Smith, '11; Adams, '04, '15, '18-'19; Nichols, '17; Hooker '17, '19; Chapman, '31; and Allen, '34. Many of the problems of the ecologist have not yet reached the stage that permits precise physical and mathematical formulation, and therefore useful generalizations are welcome which are less precise, but no less service- able. It is desirable that whenever possible these formulations should be given the process and dynamic form of expression and sequence because of its emphasis on causal relations. In dealing with the gross physical environment greater dependence is placed upon physical laws, because they operate without the complexity that is involved when organisms are included. The dynamic status of organic systems, their cycles of action, and their trends in relation to other organisms are of the greatest interest and importance. Thus climate, topography and geological influences all contribute environmental suc- cessions. Some of the main dynamic generalizations of the physical world apparently apply also to plant and animal communities in varying degrees, and are very suggestive as well in connection with human economic and social problems. That the organic world does not expand wholly at random, suggests that there are both internal and external factors that limit it under existing conditions. Some of the internal factors are clearly those imposed by the hereditary history; and these are possibly restricted by both physical and chemical limitations and affinities. The external limiting factors are like- wise varied and complex, and many efforts have been made to formulate the relations of these two major systems and their laws of change or orderly sequence. The dynamic and process viewpoint has therefore already made available a considerable variety of guiding ideas and working hypotheses for ecological work, but one must not assume that these are of equal value. There are also great differences of opinion among scientists regarding both their basal assumptions and their method of application, so that it is very desirable for each one to know definitely on what hypothesis his own work is based and to recognize that used by others. PLANT AND ANIMAL ECOLOGY "To study life we must consider three things: first, the orderly sequence of external nature; second, the living organism and the changes which take place in it; and, third, that continuous adjustment between the two sets of phenomena which constitutes life." "The physical sciences deal with the external world, and in the laboratory we study the structure and activities of organisms by very similar methods; but if we stop there, neglecting the relation of the living being to its environ- ment, our study is not biology or the science of life." William K. Brooks, "The Foundations of Zoology," 1915, p. 54.</page><page sequence="7">322 CHARLEIS C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 "We are apt to contrast the extreme of instinct and intelligence to emphasize the blindness and inflexibility of the one and the consciousness and freedom of the other. It is like contrasting the extremes of light and dark and forgetting all the transitional degrees of twilight. . . . Instinct is blind; so is the highest human wisdom blind. The distinction is one of degree. There is no absolute blindness on the one side, and no absolute wisdom on the other." C. 0. Whitman, 1899. " It is essentially a recognition of the fundamental identity of the animal and human souls, the differences between which are regarded merely as differences of degree of development. This implies that intelligence is not exclusively human and that the animal mind is to be interpreted in the light of human psychology, a procedure which is, of course, open to the charge of anthropomorphism. But owing to the fact that all our science is necessarily anthropomorphic and that man himself is merely a highly developed animal and therefore could not if he would interpret other animals except in terms of himself, the charge can only mean that he continually runs the risk of attributing to animals a greater development of intelligence than they possess." William M. Wheeler, "On Instincts," Jour. Abnormal Psy- chology, Dec. 1920-March, 1921, p. 302. The above quotation from Brooks shows a grasp of the process point of view that is not prevalent even today. We should not, read into this more than it meant to him, but that does not weaken its validity. To consider the orderly sequence of external nature means that the dynamic status of a system must be determined, its cycles of activity must be known, and its trends, succession or orderly sequence must be determined, and finally its relative dynamic equilibrium must also be established or anticipated. Until some progress has been made along these lines not much of scientific interpretation is to be expected. Fortunately, as has been indicated, much has already been done in the determination of physical dynamics. This is seen in the daily, seasonal and other cycles, which furnish an extensive background for dealing with climatic influences and other physical processes. The crustal movements of the earth and the erosion of the lands provide other series of orderly sequences, and furnish a background for the broad world relations that are of the utmost importance to the ecologist. Turning to the orderly sequences within the plant and animal, first of all is the individual life cycle, which experience has shown to be of universal utility. And among the internal sequences are both those that are rela- tively stable and those that are relatively changeable. Among the conservative influences are heredity, certain forms of behavior and structure; and of the flexible kinds are many physiological responses, and also certain forms of behavior. Among plants and animals there are a large number of small cyclical, physiological and other rhythms that are available for study by this method. A culmination or extension of the life cycle system may be seen in certain groups of "social" insects, such as bees and ants, which are the outgrowth of a parental relation. In addition to the individual life cycle there are those organisms that</page><page sequence="8">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 323 are bound together by common racial descent, and thus form a taxonomic unit, and have a cycle of much longer duration than that of the individual. This produces the racial sequence or cycle; and thus with the individual and the race the strictly hereditary organic series is complete. The only remaining major series is the grouping of organisms into living communities and associations, including both the hereditary groups and those that live together in the same area or unit of environment. This therefore involves their relation to the "land" surface of the earth. Thus the individual, the racial aggregations and the community include all of the major series of the orderly sequences with which organisms are concerned, from the lowest to the highest in the scale of organic complexity. With these series viewed dynamically, as well as those of the physical environment, the study of the process of interaction between the organism and its environ- ment follows naturally and thus completes this picture. This series includes all the conditions stated by Brooks, and in addition it provides a genetic explanation of the relation of organisms to their complete environment, as the culmination of ecological relations. As has been said, in dealing with internal and external successions, it is desirable that we should constantly do our habitual thinking in dynamic terms, bearing clearly in mind the dynamic status of the system, its condition of stress, its process of adjustment, and its relative equilibrium developed by this process. This is an orderly sequence. Finally, it should be re- peated that by applying as many of the appropriate dynamic principles as possible-including such generalizations as the principle of Le Chatelier, the modified Bancroft's, Vernon's and Liebig's laws, the idea of a relative optimum, limiting factors, law of diminishing returns, the modifiability of behavior, and all that is implied in ecological successions (dominance, climaxes, etc.)-it is seen that a considerable variety of generalizations are now available for use. There are, of course, other principles and ideas that should receive adequate attention, and be brought into this field for dis- cussion, evaluation and constant revision. An important factor in ecological succession is the changing rate or flow of the population elements in the successive communities. As a rule, in a new unoccupied habitat the pioneers are few in number, but in time other organisms arrive, and as the population grows the relative proportions of the organisms are under constant changes in both numbers and kinds, as the competitive process advances toward the relative dynamic equilibrium of the climax association. This is the result of the balancing of all the biotic influences in relation to the environment. It appears to be a self- limiting series or system, and the relative stability of the climax is probably only apparent. In some conditions the climax association tends to include or retain numerous individuals of a few kinds; but in others a relatively large number of kinds of individuals persist. The fluctuations of these popula- tions during succession is a very complex problem. Efforts have been</page><page sequence="9">324 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 made to apply the early quantitative methods developed in the study of plankton to other plant and animal community populations; notably by Clements and others, and we may expect an extension of such methods. Others have attempted to apply the general biological results of population studies to the competition among populations, as has been done by Lotka ('25), Chapman ('31), Volterra (See Chapman, '31, pp. 409-448) and Gause ('34, see particularly p. 10). This involves also a study of the influence of limiting factors. The world-wide applications of these numerous generalizations should give proper consideration to the diversities of plants and animals in the varied habitats and biotic regions of the world, and relate them not only to their environmental history but, also to their ancestral history, which has resulted in that taxonomic diversity which is seen in the biota, and their mosaic distribution over the face of the earth both in floral and faunal areas as well as in social communities or centers. What we see today is a complex mosaic pattern, due to both of these biological influences and to the varied physical history of the different parts of the world. This complexity is the result of the conservative effects of racial history due to heredity, and the constant battle of adjustment and transformation that has gone on between the biota and the environmental history through the ages. Within the field of plant ecology the works of Warming ('09), Cowles ('99, '11), Clements ('01, '05, '16, '28), and Tansley ('20) are outstanding, and there has been no equally extensive or comprehensive work in the more complex field of modern animal ecology. The valuable earlier work by Semper and de Varigny antedated the modern movement, and was not in line with much of the later major developments, with the possible exception of the valuable work of Child ('24) and Allee ('31) on the physiology and "hygiene" of aggregations. The later and most comprehensive works on the communities of animals was by Ruthven and others ('06), Adams and others ('09), Adams ('08, '09, '09a, '09b, '13, '15, '15a, '15b), Shelford ('13) and Chapman ('31), their students and others. Of work in the Old World mention should be made of that by Kashkarov ('33) and Elton ('27). The ecology of the American fresh water biota, particularly that of lakes, has been given extensive study. Considerable attention has been given to their physical and chemical conditions and to the quantitative study of their plankton. Streams have been much neglected, with the notable exception of the Illinois River. Plankton studies, both fresh water and marine, early became quantitative, but did not adopt the ecological ideas of the period, and have remained relatively static; later they became more physiological, but did not become thoroughly dynamic, and recently have not made great progress from the community standpoint. The Danish fresh water studies have often had a more modern stand- point, no doubt due to the relatively advanced position of ecology in Den- mark. The most illuminating work on marine animal ecology has been that</page><page sequence="10">July, 1935 GENEIRAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 325 in Danish waters, and the best general statement of shore conditions is by Flattely and Walton ('22). We have no corresponding marine work in America, in spite of the early example by Verrill, and the many years of active work by several marine biological institutions. The development of the emotions and of greater intelligence in the higher animals and man introduces certain qualitative differences in re- sponses that influence all ecological relations. There is much in common between the sessile animals of the sea and plants (Shelford, '14), so much so that for a long time there was much confusion as to their affinities and reactions. Even among free-living animals and plants there are innumerable degrees of freedom. Many animals are relatively sedentary and their lives are confined to a small area of land or water, and even animals of considerable intelligence are often similarly limited, while still others wander extensively or make prolonged migrations, as the birds, bats and whales. The relative freedom of motion in animals has possibly led to an overestimate of their freedom and to the neglect of those limitations of the environment and of behavior that together restrain them. Much has been made of physical and geographic barriers, and there is no doubt as to their influence, but the physiological and mental limitations have not been as fully studied (cf. Rabaud, '28; Heape, '31). It is only in recent years that the regional spacing of breeding birds has received independent recognition and study (cf. Adams, '08, pp. 140-42; Howard, '20, '29; Mousley', 19, and Saunders, '29), not only for its influence upon breeding habits but also on account of its influence upon succession. That birds which nest in large colonies on the shores space themselves has long been observed, but that a similar but larger unit of spacing applied to the majority of birds during their breeding season was much slower in gaining adequate recognition. Many mammals are similarly limited, such as rabbits, deer and those which are closely tied to a burrow or a den. The behavior of animals is thus seen to limit their freedom of action and as a result it orients them in space; and combined with the physical barriers it indicates that these influences are important con- trolling factors in their successional relations. Many kinds of invertebrates show similar local limitations. These influences determine the choice or selection of a habitat when an animal has a chance to exercise a preference. The behavior of animals, as limited by their physiology, emotions, instincts and intelligence, is thus seen to be of the greatest importance in orienting them and the role which they play in any given animal and plant community, or as well in understanding their successional relations. Considerable advances have been made in recent years in the study of animal behavior, and the summaries and discussions by Jennings, Holmes ('11), Thorndike ('11), Washburn ('26), Watson ('19), Wheeler ('10, '23, '28), Holt ('15, '31), Tolman ('32) and many others indicate the status of this field. Certain authors, as Wheeler ('10, '23, '28), Alverdes ('27) and others</page><page sequence="11">326 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 have given much attention to the relation of animals to one another from what has been called a " social " point of view, as in the case of ants and other "social" insects, but this is not the "social community" of the plant and animal ecologists. As previously mentioned Allee ('31) and Child ('24) have extended and elaborated physiological and ecological ideas of animal aggregates, and have indicated some of their applications to human social relations. I am inclined to the view that animal and human sociology includes all intimate physiological and "sanitary" interrelations between the individual members of ant and other " social " insects, and that these relations are to be included in the larger synthesis of the ecological community to which they belong; and that it is primarily to the responses of this more comprehensive unit that we must look for the greatest illumination bearing on the broad human social relations. In other words, human social communities are not solely the outgrowth or blossoming of the physiological, aggregational or parental relations of animals, but involve as well an added factor or in- fluence provided by the ecological social community. In looking forward to the transition from the ecology of the lower animal to human social ecology it is very important to recall Wheeler's ('21, p. 318) remark that "the subconscious is the animal mind." It seems rather strange that during the modern revival of active interest in animal behavior, intelligence seems to have attracted the most attention, while it would seem that the most revealing behavior would come from a study of animal emo- tions (cf. several papers by Craig, '09); and it is probable that the study of emotions will in the near future throw the most light upon human behavior and social conditions. It appears that the work of the psychoanalyests has helped to bridge this gap in part. The results of their studies, as interpreted by Holt ('15, '31), and by the leading English plant ecologist Tansley ('20a), will prove particularly valuable in studying the transition from animal to human social behavior. As we advance from the individual to the social community we have an ascending series of systems which become increasingly complex, and whose interaction and integration are of paramount importance (cf. Adams, '18-'19). Integration extends through all of these series of systems, and its processes include all the activities in response to the environment. In concluding the sketch of this phase, mention is made of certain gen- eralizations that have been developed as the outgrowth of the study of the succession of plant and animal communities, because they involve ultimately the summation of all ecological relations, individual, aggregate and community. Warming ('09, p. 356) summarized his views on plant successions, indicating initial, transitional and final communities. He showed that the pioneers that came from the vicinity were those with the best means of dispersal, and that there was the precedence of the light requiring trees over the shade enduring kinds. Cowles ('11) indicated the</page><page sequence="12">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 327 next important step in his recognition of the climax as a stage of relative equilibrium. Clements ('04, pp. 133-136; '05, pp. 264-267) early sum- marized his views on the "laws of succession," and certain phases of animal succession were summarized by me (Adams '08, pp. 125-128). The next step is the application and extension of these general ideas to the distinctly human aspects of the general problem. SOME PHASES OF HUMAN ECOLOGY "An important distinction needs to be made if there are to be social sciences differentiated from psychology. In this volume, the distinction is based upon functional groups, as distinguished from genetic groups. All behavior has social implications; the behavior with which this volume is concerned is explicit. The functional group (cooperative association) ex- hibits explicit social behavior; the genetic group (family) exhibits implicit social behavior. Within the family, behavior is social, whereas within the functional group, behavior becomes social by virtue of interests and pur- poses. The older sociology regarded the social process as a relation between individuals and hence social theory revolved about this relation. The present thesis is that a pragmatic sociology must regard the social process as a relation between groups." (Lindeman, '24, p. 354.) "Economics, therefore, is merely Human Ecology, it is the narrow and special study of the ecology of the very extraordinary community in which we live. It might have been a better and brighter science if it had begun biologically. . . . And all we shall say will be based on general ecology. Man is so peculiar a creature that a really satisfactory treatment of the science of work and wealth demands a companion work upon the scale of this Science of Life. But here we hope to show that ecology lays the foundations for a modern, a biological and an entertaining treatment of what was once very properly known as the "dismal science" of economics." (Wells, Huxley, and Wells, '34, p. 962.) "From the biological point of view my Professors would be human ecologists; indeed Human Ecology would be a good alternative name for this new history as I conceive it. . . . They would be related to the older school of historians much as vegetable physiologists, ecologists and mor- phologists are related to the old plant-flattening, specimen-hunting, stamen- counting botanists. The end of all intelligent analysis is to clear the way for synthesis. The clearer their new history became the nearer they would be to efficient world-planning. . . . Sooner or later Human Ecology under some name or other, will win its way to academic recognition and to its proper place in general education-in America sooner than in Europe, I guess-but the old history made up of time-worn gossip and stale and falsified politics, is deeply embedded in literature and usage. The invasion of the field of history by the scientific spirit is belated and slow. . . . Just as the Outline of History was an experiment in analytical history, so this [Science of Lifel was to be an experiment in synthetic, descriptive economics and politics. The exactest name for such a synthesis would be the 'Outline of Human Ecology.' But I did not call it that because the word Ecology was not yet widely understood." (H. G. Wells, "Experiment in Auto- biography," 1934, pp. 552-553; 617.) In the preceding section I have called attention to certain ideas and generalizations of general ecology. Several of these are known to be</page><page sequence="13">328 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 broadly applicable to man because he is an animal, and as well because he is dependent upon the physical, plant and animal world as definitely as any other animal, although to a different degree. In dealing primarily with the plant and animal world, we have seen that there are many generalizations and various points of view. Some of these are, in varying degrees, conflicting, antagonistic, and some are possibly contradictory. But if these ideas are critically and intelligently used even an erroneous conception may be so revised as to be a useful tool. In general, however, emphasis is placed upon the continuity of the processes and sequence of changes which are revealed in the sub-human biological world, rather than to emphasize their distinctness from the conditions found in human communities. The complexity involved in human affairs only emphasizes the need of keeping the problems in as simple terms as is possible. The old relation of heredity and environment now becomes, in human affairs "nature" and "nurture," but there is nothing new about it. (Cf. Schwesinger, '33; Febvre, '25; Thomas, '25.) The hereditary diversity, and the blending of the races have given the racial variety which is bait for the politician, and the bane of the statesman, because between race and "culture" arise a vast number of world problems and conflicts. The recognition of human ecology and the utilization of the definitely developed ecological ideas are of very recent development. The older authors recognized the general field but did not elaborate it. Several geographers, notably Huntington, in a series of books ('15, '27 and other volumes), have stressed the physical influence of the environment, particu- larly the climate, upon races and culture. Thomas ('25) has summarized the geographic influences on social relations. The racial aspects of Europe have been ably developed by Ripley ('15), while Taylor ('27), and Dixon ('23) have elaborated the origin and migration of the races of men, and finally an important critical study of the results of the mingling of races has been made by Hankins ('26). To the American the ecology of the Indian is of special importance, because of his role in the primeval environ- ment, and this phase has been particularly well developed by Wissler ('26). He has shown very clearly the intimate relation of the natural resources, particularly the biological resources, to the culture of the Indians, and incidentally this also shows how much the Indian contributed to his domi- nant white successor, who has incorporated Indian corn, tobacco, cotton, potatoes, tomatoes and other plants, into his cultural system. In recent years two outstanding treatises on biology have appeared by British authors, who have given unusual recognition to the relation of general ecology to human ecology; the first being by Wells, Huxley and Wells ('34) to which reference has been made in the quotation at the begin- ning of this section. The second is by Thomson and Geddes ('31) where the human social aspects are even more emphasized, but whose ecological standpoint is not so recent. In each work there was apparently a distinctly</page><page sequence="14">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 329 social-minded author involved (H. G. Wells, and Geddes). The results of these discussions deserve widespread attention, as they are indicative of the newer outlook which is likely to become increasingly prevalent (cf. Tansley, '20). It is significant to observe that as the application of the scientific methods to human social problems progresses, the methods of the natural history sciences and business technique are increasingly being applied to them. For this purpose the methods of the regional and ecological surveys are particularly appropriate and illuminating. These methods have been more prevalent in economic studies than in the social ones; no doubt because of the more frequent technical and scientific training of the students of economics. As examples of these recent social surveys, reference is made to the Lynds ('29) "Middletown," and Marshall's ('33) "Arctic Village." It could not be expected that the older social surveys would escape all the errors that were made by the older natural history surveys. They did not; but both have been greatly improved during the last 20 years in their technique and standardization, with the result that many significant comparisons are now possible. There is possibly too strong a tendency toward static business methods of study, rather than toward accumulating and interpretating the facts ecologically or functionally. Cross sections have their value, but the past and the future must receive attention in dealing with life relations, and provision should be made for this phase in the surveys or it will be lacking in the results. This means that specific efforts should be made to determine just what processes, pressures and trends are at work in any given condition or community. (Cf. Burgess, '16, on social surveys; Elmer, '17; Taylor, '19; and especially Allen and Harrison, '30). Another relation that is often neglected or slighted in social and economic surveys is the physical and biological foundation of the problem. Furthermore, if surveys are conducted from too narrow an angle they will defeat their own purpose. Many years ago Geddes and Thomson at Edinburgh, Scotland, com- bined in their summer schools field courses and surveys of the biological and the social sciences (cf. Thomson and Geddes, '31, pp. 1384-1401), and they maintained a lifelong interest in such problems. This kind of combination has received relatively slight attention in this country. (Cf. Silloway, '20, and Brown, '20.) Of the various techniques applicable to social problems, the methods of the physical sciences will prove the most valuable for the study of the physi- cal aspects of the economic and social environment; those of biology and of ecology for the primarily infra-human aspects, and to an important degree for the more primitive and backward human conditions, and possibly even for their emotions, habits and instincts. And finally, psychological and ecological methods must dominate the distinctly inter-human phases of the problem. To fuse the best features of all these general ideas and techniques</page><page sequence="15">330 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 into a practical research program, and to apply them appropriately to any given problem, is one of the most important practical undertakings in human ecology. The sociologists have already made a "self survey" or intensive study of their own current methods, as actually employed by representative students in making important sociological contributions (Rice, '31), and ecologists might well follow their example. Sound pro- cedures only will give dependable results, and as well develop an adequate perspective for their interpretation. At the same time the attempt to solve human ecological, economic and sociological problems solely on the psy- chological plane, without adequate recognition of the other ecological, biological and physical foundations, can give only incomplete and misleading results. We must never overlook the fact that human communities are never composed solely of one kind or species of animal. They are not "pure cultures," but are composed of the vegetation upon which they are directly or indirectly dependent, the human parasites, the commensals, and those animals exploited by man, as well as the human associates. The processes by which human communities are integrated have been the object of much serious study. Thus Bagehot ('73) many years ago pointed out the value of discussion and competition, and many have dis- cussed phases of this problem. In recent years outstanding insight in group activities and functions, group competition, adjustment and leader- ship, and particularly that of "participant" leadership, have been made by Lindeman ('24, '33) and Follett ('24). The technique that has been de- veloped by these students will prove of value in other fields (cf. Hader and Lindeman, '33). The extension of these methods to the problems of government has been developed and emphasized by both Follett and Lindeman. Other sociologists who have stressed the ecological approach to human sociology are McKenzie ('25, '27), Park and Burgess ('25) and Burgess ('27); Anderson and Lindeman ('28). Charles ('34) has stressed the ecological population problem. I am refraining from listing several promi- nent books on "social" psychology because these authors have apparently not yet appreciated that in addition to the individual and the aggregate aspects of ecology it is the social community aspect that is of supreme importance, in the study of human sociology, ecology and government. I am in hearty accord with Lindeman ('24, pp. 161-168) in this respect, as is indicated throughout this discussion. As long as biology is taught and developed primarily from the indi- vidualistic, or solely aggregate standpoint, with slight or inadequate recognition of the social community aspect, the students of the allied sciences will continue to utilize and accept only the older concepts, and thus retard the integration of the biological and social sciences. Once more it seems necessary to state what has been stressed throughout this paper, that if emphasis is placed upon the process, dynamic and functional point of view.</page><page sequence="16">July, 1935 GENERAL ECOLOGY AND HUMAN ECOLOGY 33I some of this confusion, which is so clearly evident in dealing with human ecology, may be reduced or avoided. Advance in general ecology is now a limiting factor retarding the advance of human ecology. This entire dis- cussion of human ecology has a direct application to ecologists themselves and to the advancement of ecology. Let us now turn to the specific application of the process standpoint to general human ecology. From what source come the stresses or pressures in human relations? The answer is a simple one. Instead of universal uni- formity in the physical features and the distribution of the natural resources of the earth, there is very great diversity and inequality. The complicated regional history, and the similar complexity among the plants and animal communities, all reflect this same variety, to which man himself is no ex- ception. The results of this multiple diversity are far-reaching indeed, as these differences tend to produce relatively independent units or systems of action, and permit and reinforce the development of a certain amount of individuality and distinctness of both race and culture. Between these centers of individuality there develop pressure, competition, or friction of some degree (cf. Bancroft's law). Thus with physical, plant, animal and human diversity the stage is set for all degrees of pressure and stresses. Part of the pressure exerted upon man is a reflex, due to his own influence upon his environment. The broad features of this have seldom been studied in a thoroughly comprehensive manner. A classic in this field, which has never been superseded, is Marsh's "The Earth as Modified by Human Action" (1874), and the best allied recent work is by Ritchie, "The In- fluence of Man on the Animal Life of Scotland" (1920). In this early study Marsh (l.c. p. 297) pointed out that a fundamental contrast in land use is between the woodland and ploughland, a distinction of similar importance to the recognition of rural and urban lands. These distinctions furnish the bases for ecological units or entities. Land use also implies the mineral and biological resources in relation to man, which was developed by Van Hise (1910) in his "Conservation of Natural Resources in the United States." (See also for ecological aspects of this problem Clements, '16, '28, and Adams, '25, '25a, and '26). The interrelations that result from these basal relations are not only of primary ecological importance but are a practical problem of the first magnitude because of the need of maintaining a proper balance and adjustment between them. The processes of adjustment to pressure from these centers of stress give an unending series of changes. Not only do these processes operate in any given locality, but the physical conditions themselves change and even migrate, as do those of the biological and ecological environment. The rate of change varies greatly, some sectors moving more rapidly than others, among plants and animals as well as with man. And while all stages in the process of human social succession are not preserved, the broad outlines of social successions are even more completely known than are those of plants and animals to the ecologists.</page><page sequence="17">332 CHARLES C. ADAMS Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 The sociological succession of social relations thus opens up a large field of study. The records of archeology and history contain a vast amount of data bearing on this subject, but the modern conceptions of ecological succession have not been extensively utilized in their interpretation, and very naturally, because of their imperfect organization of the subject by the ecologists themselves. A fertile field awaits the attention of the student who will prepare himself for this next advance, and cultivate the neglected borderland between general ecology and human ecology. Human ecology is not restricted solely to the past or to the present, it is also vitally concerned with the future. It is the tradition of ecologists to endeavor to understand the present in terms of the past, and to regularly anticipate future successions and developments. Likewise in the case of human ecology there is every reason to continue the same attitude. There are many relatively persistent trends at the physical and biological levels, and even in the human successions as well, in spite of the frequent tendency to over-emphasize the uncertainties involved in anticipating the future. The present gap between the relatively advanced stage of several of the physical and biological sciences, and of the distinctly social sciences calls for special research before the next great advance can be made, and human ecology, broadly conceived, occupies a large part of that field. General ecology has to contribute to this program confidence in the scientific method, a considerable number of working ideas and generalizations, and now we need students who will cultivate intensively this neglected field.
