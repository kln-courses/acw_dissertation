<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evidence and inference. Edited by Daniel Lerner. Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1959. 164 pp. The essays of this collection originated in the Hayden Colloquium on Scientific Method and Concept of MIT and were first published in Daedalus. They do not deal with the traditional philosophical problems which the titles of the book and the colloquium may suggest. The contributors have tried to say something of general interest about the way conclusions are drawn in their special disciplines. This is not easily done. Detailed accounts of techniques of reasoning whose significance and probative force can be appreciated only by the specialist are not apropos, and generality may easily slip over into banality. R. Aron ("Evidence and Inference in History") sets aside as a specialist's affair the logic of the reconstruction of past events from present evidence, and writes on some other difficulties involved in attempts to answer four basic questions of history (sample: why and how did it happen ?). H. M. Hart, Jr., and J. T. McNaughton ("Some Aspects of Evidence and Inference in the Law") find reasons that the judicial process is only partly scientific: e.g., decisions must be made under the constraint of special conditions (now, on just this evidence selected by these interested parties) not ordinarily imposed on the researcher. The fact-value question is so treated that legislation cannot be said to be a scientific process. E. H. Erikson ("The Nature of Clinical Evidence") argues that the psychoanalyst must use certain subjective evidence produced in the clinical en- counter: his reactions, emotions included, to the patient. This evidence may be supported and checked by objective tests and analytic theory, but Erikson's account makes it seem also irreducible and irreplaceable. This is an expectedly touchy and perhaps question-begging point in a paper of good quality. M. Deutsch ("Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research") believes that all experimental physicists reason with the indis- pensable aid of "potential or imagined sense impressions"; it is added that frequently the image is anthropomorphic. The wider significance, if any, of these remarks about the psychology of physical investigation is not made clear. P. F. Lazarsfeld ("Evidence and Inference in Social Research") weaves a garland of problems and distinctions arising in attitude measurement, makes large claims for the importance of mathematical models of human behavior, but regrets that the value of models so far proposed is limited by their reference in an essential way to gambling situations. The collection is advertised as presenting "a unified view of research in progress in a wide range of fields of intellectual interest today." For the sake of research in progress, it is to be hoped that this is not the case. None of the papers is without some interest, but the performance, if it can be fairly regarded as a whole, seems perfunctory. (The inclusion of an J. Fine's "In Search of a Poison", a report of experimental work, unfortunately strengthens the impression that it was hard to scrape together several solid theoretical pieces about evidence and inference.) With a view to unifying the volume, the editor labors after comparisons and contrasts. Some of his observations seem forced (e.g., none of the contributors is really concerned with the problem of the probability of the single case), and they are all embedded in a simplified and emotive version of intellectual historythat will strike the audience to which the volume is addressed as being not what is wanted nowadays.
