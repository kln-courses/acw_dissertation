<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Attributes of God. Gifford Lectures, 1924-25. By LEWIS RICHARD FARNELL. Oxford University Press, 1925.-pp. 283. Since the rise of Comparative Religion, with its irritating habit of tracing august ideas to humble beginnings and confronting cheri hed beliefs with deadly parallels, liberal theologians have been accustomed to take refuge in the comforting dictum that "origin does not affect validity." Farnell, in his recent Gifford Lectures, sweeps away this bulwark against critical reflection, and frankly states that it is impossible and undesirable to shield theology completely against objections and queries raised by Comparative Religion. "We can imagine," he remarks (p. 8) "how difficult it might be to maintain a fervid Mariolatry among sincere Christians, if the worshipper was vividly conscious that he was worshipping, not the historic personage, but another form of the great Pagan Goddess of the Mediterranean." The student of theology or of philosophy must therefore expect to</page><page sequence="2">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 83 find much grist for his mill in Farnell's careful study of the changing attributes ascribed to deity at different stages in the evolution of religion. The uniformities in man's thought of God, thinks Farnell, are largely due to the constancy of human needs. Man attributes to the deity, in the act of prayer, precisely those qualities which fit the existing practical emergency; and the use of the fitting appellative is felt to have a constraining magical effect. "Hence arises a large liturgical vocabulary of such appellatives, and their influence in building up . . . the complete conception of the Godhead is obvious" (p. 14). Side by side with this pragmatic process of "projection, or sky-reflection" is to be set another, more mystic source of uniformity: man's "intuitive soul-perception" of a "power other and stronger than himself which possesses him, 'ecstasizes' or carries him out of himself, exalting him or subduing him, and which he cannot but personify as superhuman and divine" (p. 17). Anthropomorphism, says Farnell, is universally present wherever vital religion exists; an impersonal deity (pace Professor Leuba) is religiously valueless; but, one asks, is this inevitable anthropomorphism rooted in our incorrigible tendency to project our human values upon the cosmic screen, or in a trustworthy intuition of something personal in the cosmos? The greater part of the book, however, deals not with the uni- formities but with the diversities in man's thought of God-the endless incongruities introduced into the concept by the different strands of experience and reflection which have gone into its making. In the Christian conception of God, attributes derived from Nature jostle against attributes derived from the tribal and national functions of deity; moral attributes clash with the attribute of omnipotence; Greek conceptions of divine Beauty, Wisdom and Truth enrich the turbid stream of Oriental theism, but obstinately remain unfused with other conceptions. Farnell reviews the various expedients de- vised by metaphysical reflection for reconciling these incongruous elements: each expedient, he points out, has its own peculiar difficulties; and all philosophical concepts of deity run the risk of becoming too subtle and desiccated for religious consumption. The author seems to suggest, more than once, that the frankly anthropo- morphic concept of a finite God offers relief from a multitude of incongruities, while sacrificing fewer religious values than most of its rivals (pp. 26, 277). The theologian cannot possibly afford to ignore this volume. The</page><page sequence="3">84 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VoL.
