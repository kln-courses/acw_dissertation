<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nationalism and Social Communication: An In- quiry into the Foundations of Nationality. By KARL W. DEUTSCH. Boston: Technology Press of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons; London: Chapman &amp; Hall, Ltd., 1953. Pp. x+292. $5.00. In a number of earlier publications (especial- ly Philosophy of Science, Vol. XVIII [1951]; Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. XII [1951]; and Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. XVI [1952]) Karl Deutsch, professor of history and political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recommended as a model for the social sciences the conceptual scheme popular- ized by his colleague, Norbert Wiener, under the name "cybernetics" (cf. Wiener's Cybernetics [1948] and The Human Use of Human .Beings [1950]). Cybernetics is a theory of control and "communication" processes in such electronic systems as computing machines and servo- mechanisms (such self-steering machines as "homing" torpedoes). These machines have the characteristic, among others, of adjusting their performance progressively, in response to sig- nals from their own past activity-the now well- known "feedback" principle. Such systems are held to furnish a dynamic equilibrium model much superior to classical models in their ap- proximation of processes of "self-direction," "development," "learning," etc. Although they are analogous to organisms and societies in com- plexity and dynamics, they can be fully de- scribed by mathematical techniques. In this we have the promise of a social science able to deal mathematically with "irreversible changes in structure, . . . growth... self-transforming processes, in short, history" (Deutsch, Nation- alism, p. 2). Deutsch now for the first time applies the concepts of cybernetics to an empirical problem in the field of the social sciences-description of the characteristic features of nationalism, its sources, "configurations of symptoms," typical sequences of development. The work is primari- ly programmatic; it formulates theory and prob- lems and suggests lines of research. The crucial concept in cybernetics is infor- mation. Electronic "communication" systems transmit not events but a patterned relation- ship between events (e.g., the telephonic trans- mission of speech patterns), and it is the pattern that constitutes "information." Methods have been developed for measuring this "informa- tion'' and so obtaining measures of losses and distortions in transmission. These yield meas- ures of the efficiency of a channel and of the relative efficiency or complementarity of any stage or part of the system in relation to others. "Communication," then, is a mechanical proc- ess, and the term implies nothing with respect to the meaning of the transmitted patterns or the social-psychological processes of interpretation. It is a truism that the meaning of symbols in communication is a function not of their fixed patterns alone but of fixed pattern and variable social context. Symbols are interpreted in action which varies with the situation of the actors who use them. Measures of visual or auditory pat- tern may be one possible class of interpretants (to use Peirce's term) that is more appropriate to the situation of engineers than to that of stu- dents of social life. How can the author believe that in the mere fact of such measurement we have a new key to our problems? "This develop- ment,'' he exclaims, "is significant for wide fields of natural and social science. Information is indeed the 'stuff... dreams are made of.' Yet it can be transmitted, recorded, analyzed, and measured" (p. 69). A bridge is made from cybernetics to social science by joining the concept of information with the concept of culture, for culture also con- sists of "patterns." Culture may be divided, for this purpose, into "cultural channels" (relative- ly fixed communication facilities and perhaps also "habits, preferences, and institutions" [p. 64]; the term is not clearly defined) and cul- tural "information," consisting of those ele- ments of culture considered to involve commu- nication (e.g., "knowledge, values, traditions, news, gossip and commands" [p. 64]). Informa- tion, in this sense, is the central concept for the study of nationalism. "Cultural complemen- tarity,'' the efficiency with which individuals or groups transmit cultural information, is the basis of community and of nationality and in- creases or decreases with various changes in so- cial, economic, and political conditions. Cul-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 485 tural information is measurable, and measures of cultural complementarity can be derived from it. This is said to be one of our major tasks, and a number of possible procedures are suggested, such as measuring the relative complementarity of individuals or groups from different cultures by observing differences in their performance on word-association tests (p. 84) or their ability to join together in task groups (p. 82). Another use of the concept of complementarity is demon- strated in a study (chap. vi) of national assimi- lation in countries of heterogeneous culture. Subcultural groups are assimilated to the cul- ture of the dominant group as their cultural complementarity increases, for complementari- ty means availability for communication. The author divides the population into segments in different degrees of complementarity, or readi- ness for assimilation to the culture of the domi- nant group, on the basis of degree of familiarity with the dominant language. Rates of change in the size and distribution of these population segments, calculated from census data, show assimilation trends and permit predictions about the future course of assimilation. It is evident that the cybernetics model, when applied to society, produces confusion of theory and oversimplification of problems. It might also be noted that no new method of "measuring" cultural "information" is actually described-nor could we have expected any. The original error of equating mechanical "in- formation" transmission with meaningful com- munication has been compounded by further pairing with the exceedingly abstract notion of culture. After these transformations it can serve at best as a vague analogy, not as a basis for measurement. In fact, the author is able to use his model, in much of his discussion, only by in- troducing many social, political, and economic relationships and processes which are not placed in the cybernetics scheme (e.g., division of labor, migration, social mobility, intermarriage, racial antagonisms, class alliances, political coercion, etc.). And one is not surprised to find the ex- pression "social communication" creeping into the text with its old-fashioned connotations of "sharing" of ideas (p. 65) and "mutual under- standing" (p. 72). Oversimplification by analogy probably has its value in science, and sociologists may find sections of this book suggestive, especially the final chapter on national "will" and "conscious- ness." But after reading it one feels that, if the engineers stopped misrepresenting their field as a science of "communication," we would be spared a great deal of unnecessary confusion. Some less anthropomorphic name like "code networks" or "signal systems" is recommended. DONALD HORTON University of Chicago</page></plain_text>
