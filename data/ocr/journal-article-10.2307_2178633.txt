<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beauty and Ugliness, and Other Studies in Psychological Esthetics. By VERNON LEE and C. ANSTRUTHER-THOMSON. London, John Lane, The Bodley Head, I9I2.-pp. xvi+376. The chief author of this volume is the well-known essayist-in private life, Violet Paget. Readers of her numerous volumes on art and appreciation may be in some measure prepared for this collection of more serious studies in aesthetic theory. But although the author brings to her task a wide experience and a keen aesthetic sensibility, she appears to possess few of the qualifications for scientific exposition. It was in i897 that the essay which furnishes the title to the present volume first appeared in The Contemporary Review. At that time Miss Paget was but slightly familiar with modern literature on aes- thetics. This she tells us in reiterated passages and footnotes. Indeed, the book is scarcely more than a commentary which aims to correct and enlarge upon the central thesis which the original article sought to maintain. The thesis in question was based largely upon the introspective observations of Miss Anstruther-Thomson, who collaborated only in the original work. This lady appears to be a person of pronounced motor type, and the analyses of her acts of appreciation in the presence of works of art reveal a wealth of mimetic elements, chiefly of breathing and equilibrium. The conclusion first reached was that the active experience of these movements furnishes the basis for the feelings of pleasure and displeasure which characterize the sense of beauty and ugliness,-the Lange-James theory of emotion being found to supply the needed psychological substantiation for such a conclusion. The article came to the attention of Theodore Lipps, who reviewed it with sharp criticism. This served to introduce Miss Paget to the doctrine of empathy, as expounded in Lipps's familiar writings. She also made the acquaintance, then, of Karl Groos and other German estheticians, including some experi- mental work, especially that of Kfilpe and his pupils. As a result of this enlightenment, the chief author of the work on Beauty and Ugliness has modified her views, and here sets them forth with becoming modesty in five supplementary essays. The first of the group, entitled "Anthropomorphic F-sthetics," emphasizes the " discovery of the projection of our inner experience into the forms which we</page><page sequence="2">No. 3.] NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 365 see and realize as being the central discovery of modern esthetics" (p. I7). The second essay, on " AFsthetic Empathy and its Organic Accompaniments," is a translation from the original French published in the Revue Philosophique (1907). In this paper Lipps's theory of aesthetic empathy is subjected to a rather extended critique, the point being made that while he is justified in his contention that empathy does not involve a sense of adequate bodily adjust- ment, he is misled in supposing that the aesthetische Miterleben of Gross is with- out sensory foundation. " The Central Problem of jEsthetics," a more closely written exposition of the author's modified views, appeared first in translation in the Zeitschriftffir Aesthetik und Kunstwissenschaft (i910). The conclusions, which are in part based upon responses obtained from a questionnaire, sub- stantiate Lipps's view that empathy as a purely 'mental' phenomenon requires no bodily sensations, nor any definitely or vaguely localized 'feelings of ac- tivity'for its existence. In general, it is noted that all such imitative movements correspond to peculiarities of the shapes as such, and "are absolutely inde- pendent of what objects or movements the lines and shapes are intended to suggest to our minds" (p. I39). Next in order comes the original essay, " Beauty and Ugliness." The fifth essay is entitled "AEsthetic Responsive- ness: Its Variations and Accompaniments. Extracts from Vernon Lee's Gal- lery Diaries, I90I-4." In these scrambled entries, comments and aperwus, are to be found some of the most valuable contributions of the volume. As the author intimates, the points of chief interest to be gleaned from these notes may be classified roughly as the objective and subjective sides of aesthetic perception. She sums them up for us in two sentences:-(I) "The work of art is, so to speak, its own showman," and (2) "The total impression of a work of art is, I think, the sum of a series of acts of attention." To these two points we may devote a few words of comment and quotation. I. It is emphasized that the true work of art is entirely self-contained. "One reason for not marking the eyeballs (of a statue) is that doing so directs the glance outwards; the statue focuses. Now a statue ought, so to speak, to focus inwards . . ." (p. 260). There is no need that the perception of form should be connected with our own gesture, and too great a reality is inimical to aes- thetic perception. "It is the being busy, the doing something which makes bad statues unrestful, and prevents our looking at them" (p. 258). In this same connection, the author expresses doubt as to whether the Doryphoros and Apoxyomenos are standing still or walking. "In fact," she continues, "they are not doing either any more than a mountain. They will never be otherwise than they are. The 'movement' we talk of is a pure movement of lines, either of lines rising, expanding, carrying, etc., when we stand fixed before them, or of lines changing when we walk round (or in the 'frontal' ones across) them" (p. 258). Again, "reality, real movement, are in fact equations between our powers of recognition and a symbol, and they are therefore shifting, for the symbol alters. But the equation between our aesthetic faculty and 'form' does not alter, because there is no symbol" (p. 328). 2. The subjective side of Vernon Lee's aesthetics is incomplete. As a recent</page><page sequence="3">366 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. reviewer of this volume has noted, we miss any extended consideration of aes- thetic attitude. It is the process of apprehending and perceiving, rather than the process of assimilating which has chiefly occupied the author's attention. Regarding aesthetic experience, we read the following: "There exist in experi- ence no such abstractions as esthetic attention or esthetic enjoyment, but merely very various states of our whole being which express themselves, among other results, in various degrees and qualities of responsiveness to works of art" (p. 243). "The action of art is not hypnotic, not monoideistic, but by making a little walled garden of the soul of all manner of cognate things, a maze, in which the attention runs to and fro, goes round and round, something extremely complex and complete, taking all our faculties " (p. 344). All culminates in the perception of form, and again we verge upon the notion expressed in Beauty and Ugliness that form is a peculiar category of experience:-" May not the perception of form be, normally, a sub-conscious process accompanying the conscious process of recognition of the subject of the work of art, the utility or name of the thing represented? And would not this explain our inability to say why we like a form, as opposed to our manifest facility in saying what that form symbolizes or suggests? In other words, are we not pursuing a necessarily unclutchable phenomenon in our pursuit of perceptions of beauty and ugliness?" (p. 270). The "Conclusion" affords some further indications of the reconciliation which the author has sought to establish between her earlier views on mimetic activities as the essential basis of aesthetic appreciation, and the position of Lipps, which denies sensory adjuncts in esthetic empathy. The dynamic- empathic interpretation which she now holds is regarded as due to "extremely abstract ideas of movement and its modes residual from countless individual and possibly racial experiences" (p. 353). The mimetic-organic sensations are accordingly taken into account as a possible clue to the origin of these abstractions. The actually existing and suggestive movements which may still be found in the act of appreciation are probably chiefly those of the eyes and related parts. These, she holds, may explain the starting and keeping up of dynamic empathy. Her present belief is that aesthetic pleasure is not ex- plicable in terms of the feelings which attach to these sensations, but can be explained "on the ground prepared by such economy and replenishment of attention as is necessary for any kind of pleasant intellectual activity " (p. 358). Although the net result of this enquiry, extending over some fifteen years, is still incomplete in its survey of the elements involved in esthetic apprecia- tion, we must acknowledge the earnest and unprejudiced spirit of the enquirer, It is a hopeful sign when a writer of popular esthetic criticism of such recog- nized literary ability enters the field of exact knowledge for the purpose of clarifying her ideas and principles.
