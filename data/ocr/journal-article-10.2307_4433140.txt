<plain_text><page sequence="1">SENECA'S CHORUSES BY D.E. HILL Seneca's tragedies have not generaUy won acceptance as success- ful dramas. Critics have felt that they are so rhetorical and so iU- constructed that they could not have been written for the stage. PubUc recitation or private reading have been the fate most commen- tators have assigned them to.1) Wii?e the hostile judgements have ranged freely over many aspects of the plays, it has been Seneca's use of the chorus that has attracted particular condemnation.2) A 1) Modem scholarship normally traces this attitude back to W.A. Schlegel; a choice paragraph of his is translated in E.F. Watling's introduction to his Penguin translation of Seneca, Four Tragedies with Octavia (Harmondsworth 1966), 9, and Watling himself goes on to say (17): "It is generally agreed that the tragedies of Seneca were intended for reading or recital at private gatherings and could never have appeared in what we should call public performance". M. Coffey and R. Mayer, in Seneca, Phaedra (Cambridge 1990), 10-15, give a full account of mod- ern views on the history of Roman tragedy and rightly conclude that the evidence is not decisive against stage performance even as late as Nero (15-8); nevertheless, their attitude is well encapsulated in the words, "It must be conceded that Seneca's attempts in Phaedra to present the illusion of a stage drama are intermittent". And they are not alone; for example, RJ. Tarrant in a well balanced account of the evidence concludes: "On the whole, though, I think it probable that Seneca con- ceived his plays without regard for the restraints of theatrical production". (Thyestes Edited with Introduction and Commentary [Atlanta, Georgia 1985], 15.) 2) One other charge levelled against these plays is that they include inconsis- tent implicit stage directions; thus Fantham writes in Seneca's Troades A Hterary Introduction with text, translation and commentary (Princeton, New Jersey 1982), 35-6: "... at Phaedra 1154, Phaedra is reported as on the palace roof, but two lines later she is apparently at stage level"; but it is perverse here to interpret the chorus's question at 1154 quae uox ab altis flebitis tectis sonai? to mean anything other than 'What voice is sounding from the high palace?'. There is certainly no need to assume that it requires Phaedra to be on the roof. Fantham continues: "As for the corpse, it is treated as on stage in 1158 and 1168, but has to be brought in at Theseus' command in 1247". But this is another misunderstanding, as I show below. Fantham's third and last example of alleged unstageability occurs in the Medea: "She has killed one child with the sword at 970 and will climb up to the roof, urging the living child to follow her while she drags the other son's body.. . By 982 she must be on the roof, where she kills the second son at 1019; when the serpent chariot arrives at roof level, she tosses down the bodies... to Jason below". But the problem is wholly illusory. At 977, Medea leaves the stage drag- ging one child playing dead and urging on the other. We are then to imagine the ?

Davis3) has assembled much evidence for fuU tragic performances during the early empire and, to put it no more strongly, he is convinced that there is no reason to dismiss the idea of proper productions of Seneca's plays. Sadly, his approach to the choruses is less radical. He accepts the traditional view that the cho- ruses must, more or less, have foUowed the conventions of Greek tragedy and concludes that the difficulties of their unexplained but implausible lapses into ignorance of things they have apparendy wit- nessed can be explained by recourse to a series of departures from and returns to the scene, departures and returns which the audience is expected to have noticed, but which are never aUuded to in the text. The other main objection to Seneca's choruses, that they have no consistent identity, is vigorously, but not, as I hope to show, altogether persuasively, denied by Davis (11-38). In this piece, I hope to show how Seneca uses his choruses to achieve dramatic effect, and thus to understand what Seneca's prac- tices are, taking as my evidence what he does, not what Greek tragedians did five centuries earUer. The most reUable evidence for estabUshing Seneca's conventions must be the text of his plays, not necessarily the practice of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. If it can be shown that the choruses are consistent with Uve theatrical performance and have distinctive functions in enhancing an audience's appreciation of the dramas, a major stumbUng block to the appre- ciation of these plays as works for the theatre w?l have been removed. If works are written as drama, the onus of proof is on those who beUeve that they are not intended for the stage. Since choruses can have a dramatic effect only if they relate closely to the main body of their play, it w?l be necessary to consider whole plays in some detail. I have chosen to concentrate on Phaedra, Thyestes and Troades because aU three have been edited fairly recendy by scholars who climb up to the roof while Jason enters and for four lines (978-81) exhorts his men. At the end of this, Medea reappears on the roof to which she and the sur- viving child have climbed out of sight of the audience. At 1019 she kills the sec- ond child, subsequently throwing down at 1024 two dummies to represent the dead sons, dummies which have been secreted on the roof long before. There would be no problem in secreting the 'dead' second son after 1017. 3) Shifting Song: the Chorus in Seneca's Tragedies (Hildesheim, Z?rich, New York 1993).</page><page sequence="3">SENECA'S CHORUSES 563 have given particularly eloquent presentations of the standard criticisms.4) Phaedra The Phaedra opens with a prologue in anapaests spoken by Hippo- lytus. It attracts a savage denunciation from Coffey and Mayer. Their objections can be summed up as foUows: the passage teUs us noth- ing about Hippolytus; in particular it makes no reference to his chastity: "AU S. set out to do was to describe a hunt, not to reahze the character of an Hippolytus" (89). It is, of course, true that the prologue makes no reference to Hippolytus' famously perverse chastity and concentrates solely on the joys of the hunt. Would it not make more sense to ask why, rather than to assume that a Euripidean tour de force on neurotic chastity is the only appropriate beginning? As aU commentators observe, the story was weU known, and no doubt Seneca's audience would have had expectations similar to those of Coffey and Mayer. But the calculated frustration of expec- tation is an important tool in the armoury of any artist. In Euripides' play, Hippolytus' exclusive devotion to Artemis had provoked Aphro- dite's anger and led her to destroy him by making Phaedra faU in love with him. No further explanation was required or offered for her infatuation. In Seneca, however, the role of anthropomorphic gods is never significant,5) so that it becomes necessary to find a different explanation for why Phaedra fell in love with her step- son.6) And so we are given a picture of an immature youth besotted with hunting; his devotion to Diana takes the form entirely of a positive enthusiasm for the chase and the kiU; he makes no refer- ence to chastity; indeed he is, if anything, asexual rather than hos- tile to sex. It would not be difficult to imagine a somewhat older woman finding him attractive, especiaUy if she thinks she has been 4) Those of Coffey and Mayer (Phaedra), Tarrant (Thyestes) and Fantham (Troades), all referred to above. 5) Seneca's gods are litde more than personifications of the forces of nature as found, for instance, at Phaedra 274-357. 6) This question had already been characteristically explored by Ovid in Heroxdes 4.</page><page sequence="4">564 D.E. HILL abandoned by a rather coarse middle-aged husband.7) The effect of the prologue is to make Phaedra's love for Hippolytus credible and also therefore her confession of it to the Nurse in the next scene; but it does set up one tension. In her enthusiasm to dissuade Phaedra from the obviously unwise course of pursuing a love affair with Hippolytus, the Nurse deploys a range of arguments including the suggestion that Hippolytus is a misogynist (229-40). It is obviously in the Nurse's interests to report, exaggerate or invent any such tendency in Hippolytus. The audience w?l need to resolve the appar- ent discrepancy between the Hippolytus encountered in the pro- logue and the Hippolytus described by the Nurse. Was his misogyny ignored in the prologue, or did the Nurse invent it to help her case? At the end of the scene, the Nurse, faced by Phaedra's threats of suicide, reluctandy agrees to approach Hippolytus on her mistress's behalf, though she stresses her beUef in his misogyny again (271-3) to discourage optimism. The first chorus follows; of it, Coffey and Mayer say: "Now a chorus, of undefined gender, appear for no given reason and sing of Love's power. . . They do not say why they have chosen this theme . . .". But a reflection on the power of Love wiU give the audience the clearest possible indication that this is what the play is about. As the audience ponders how to resolve the apparent con- tradiction between the Nurse's portrait of a violendy misogynist youth and the innocent asexual Hippolytus they have seen, they are confronted by this passionate account of the power of Love. The effect is pardy to underUne the tota?ty and sincerity of Phaedra's love and to provide some excuse (or, at least, explanation) for her conduct, and partly to set the scene for a conflict between the power of Love and the obstacle of Hippolytus' asexuahty or misogyny, whichever it turns out to be. That the ideas of the chorus are to be apphed to the problems of this drama becomes obvious with the last words of their song: uincit saeuas cura nouercas (357), if love can conquer cruel stepmothers then a fortiori stepmothers Uke Phaedra wiU indeed be helpless against its power.8) As for the complaint that 7) The antecedents for this kind of argument are to be found at Ovid Her. 4.67- 84. 8) Some readers may feel that this is to over-interpret the text and that saeuas is merely a conventional epithet. While that may be so, it is hard to be convinced</page><page sequence="5">SENECA'S CHORUSES 565 the chorus is of "undefined gender", and "appear for no given rea- son", I want to argue that that is the way Seneca uses most of his choruses. By divorcing them from a specific identity, Seneca Uber- ates them to draw out whatever mood or argument is especiaUy relevant at particular moments in the drama. Any smaU cost to credib?ity (how credible is any chorus?) is more than made up for by the much wider opportunities created to explore appropriate emo- tional responses. The chorus then brings us fuUy back to the drama by reverting to iambic trimeters to ask the Nurse whether there is any improve- ment in Phaedra's condition (358-9): altrix, profare quid feras; quonam in loco est regina? saeuis ecquis est flammis modus?9) Of which Coffey and Mayer go on to say: "... nor do they reveal how they have come to know about Phaedra's erotic misery. In Attic tragedy, which aimed at some degree of plausible action, such explanations are usual: an audience wants to know how strangers become privy to a secret, or how news reaches someone who has not been present on stage". We shaU have much occasion to con- sider the apparent mystery of Senecan choruses' knowledge of what they have not been told and ignorance of what they have witnessed; suffice it to say here that, in Seneca, the problem, ff problem it be, is so common that it looks far more Uke setded po?cy than care- less oversight. There then foUows a most powerful scene (360-735) on which the whole play turns. Once again, Coffey and Mayer draw our attention to structural defects, as they see it: "The chorus now speak in iambic trimeters and indicate the return of the Nurse ... No reason is given for her return. Once again, it is his technique of by Davis's attempt (53) to argue that saeuas shows that the choral ode is not, after all, an apology for Phaedra (along the lines that the power of Love is so great that no one could be expected to resist it, not even 'cruel stepmothers') but rather an indictment: The chorus disapproves of her passion and she will indeed prove to be a 'cruel stepmother'. 9) Davis (52-3) attempts to establish that the chorus in Phaedra is a chorus of Cretan serving women presumably brought to Athens by Phaedra, but consistently unsympathetic to her. This involves not only ignoring the clear indications of the ode on Love (274-357) as discussed above, but omitting altogether these clearly sympathetic questions.</page><page sequence="6">566 D.E. HILL imitation that lets S. down. Euripides' chorus knew only that Phaedra is unweU and they can but guess at the cause. The Nurse then appears accompanying her mistress who longs for fresh air. This is aU coherent and plausible, since Phaedra has not been seen before that moment. S., however, has already produced Phaedra on stage and his chorus are well aware of her passion; since Phaedra and the Nurse had no cause to leave the stage they have no cause to return to it. S. for his part could not bring himself to dispense with the delirium of his heroine as Euripides had described it, even though he had cut away aU ground for such a scene. There is no gain, dramatic or psychological" (123). When the audience last saw Phaedra and the Nurse, Phaedra was threatening suicide and the Nurse was undertaking to prose- cute what she thought of as a desperate mission to soften Hippolytus' heart and make him receptive to Phaedra's subsequent declaration of love. After the chorus's reminder of Love's power, any audience would surely be anxious to know how the story has developed. Has Phaedra seen sense and abandoned her love? Has the Nurse been ob?ged to make the apparendy vain approach to Hippolytus? No audience, seeing the Nurse on stage, would stop to wonder how she got there.10) The Nurse's account of her mistress's continued distress (360-86) is confirmed by a brief speech from Phaedra herself who is revealed within, as the Nurse's words make plain (384-6): sed en, patescunt regiae fastigia: reclinis ipsa sedis auratae toro solitos amictus mente non sana abnuit. At the end of Phaedra's anguished speech two Unes foUow (404-5): sepone questus: non leuat miseros dolor; agreste placa uirginis numen deae. There are two schools of thought; Coffey and Mayer, "in spite of misgivings" (127), follow those who attribute these two Unes to the Nurse; on that view, the prayer to Diana must be spoken by Phaedra. IO) Davis (41), in a different context, aptly quotes Taplin's remarks on Aeschylus from The Stagecraft of Aeschylus (Oxford 1977), 66: "any hack can, if he gives the matter priority, supply a plausible motive for each exit and entry: a good play- wright particularly in conventional and unrealistic theatre, might well feel he has better things on which to employ his skill".</page><page sequence="7">SENECA'S CHORUSES 567 Boyle11) foUows those who attribute the two Unes to the chorus, interpreting them as an instruction to the Nurse who then deUvers the prayer. The chief reason for attributing the two Unes to the Nurse is that the imperative sepone is addressed most naturaUy to the immediately preceding speaker, in this case Phaedra; the prob- lem with that interpretation is that the prayer is not the prayer of a distraught woman but of a troubled one seeking divine support before a difficult confrontation. The best solution is to suppose that at the end of her speech the doors close on Phaedra, and that the chorus and the Nurse are then, once again, alone.12) It has become apparent, both from the Nurse's account and from Phaedra's brief appearance, that the Nurse has no choice but to approach Hippolytus; the chorus, understanding this, advise her to pray to Diana, the goddess most likely to be able to sway Hippolytus. The Nurse accepts the suggestion and, just as her prayer comes to an end, Hippolytus arrives on stage (423) and the Nurse decides to seize her opportu- nity (424-6): ipsum intueor soUemne uenerantem sacrum nuUo latus comitante?quid dubitas? dedit tempus locumque casus: utendum artibus. At first Hippolytus beUes his misogynistic reputation by enquiring most poUtely and soUcitously about the Nurse's apparent distress and whether it is caused by any trouble for his father, for Phaedra or for their children. The Nurse reassures him and then launches into a long speech advocating a Ufe devoted more to Venus than to Diana (437-82). One might expect the aUegedly sanctimonious Hippolytus to react with immediate hostility to this appeal. Instead, he starts with a long celebration of the joys of country Uving, espe- ciaUy hunting, very reminiscent of his opening prologue (482-524); from this he proceeds to a standard praise of a lost golden age of innocence (524-39); next he attacks war, attributing it to greed and pointing out how it can set brother against brother, father against son (540-56) and even wife against husband, mother against ch?d 11) AJ. Boyle, Seneca's Phaedra, Introduction, Text, Translation and Notes (Liverpool and Wolfeboro, N.H. 1987). 12) On any view, Phaedra must be absent by the time Hippolytus arrives at 423.</page><page sequence="8">568 D.E. HILL (556-7); after a passing condemnation of stepmothers (558), he sud- denly launches into a full scale assault on aU women, culminating in Medea (563-4): sileantur aliae: sola coniunx Aegei, Medea, reddet feminas dirum genus. Why Medea? Commentators point out that Medea had nearly k?led Theseus, Hippolytus' father, many years before.13) Since then, the boy must have known that his mother had been k?led by Theseus and that he had also abandoned Ariadne for Phaedra, and gone on an insane expedition to ravish Proserpina, the wife of Dis, King of the Underworld. If Hippolytus has disturbed notions about men and women it would not be surprising. WTiat emerges here is not some deep seated and principled misogyny but a turbulent and immature state of mind which has adopted the escapism of a sim- ple hunting Ufe but which can, when provoked, erupt into sudden wild attacks on womankind. These make the Nurse despair (580-2) but, just at that moment, Phaedra enters (has she heard the out- burst from offstage?) and starts to coUapse into a faint. Hippolytus catches her, as the Nurse points out, tuus en, alumna, temet Hippolytus tenet, and behaves most solicitously towards her. Suddenly his dis- like of women vanishes as suddenly as it had appeared. That these were the posturings of na?ve adolescence becomes even clearer as the scene develops. No true misogynist with a special hatred of step- mothers would have responded to Phaedra's commodes paulum, precor, secretas aures. si quis est abeat comes (599-600) with the words en locus ab omni liber arbitrio uacat (601).14) StiU less would such a person fail so utterly to comprehend Phaedra's obvious advances (609-45); but Hippolytus' reaction is exacdy what one would expect of the na?ve adolescent he so obviously is. The turning point in this exchange occurs at 645. As it becomes harder and harder even for Hippolytus to misunderstand the thrust of Phaedra's remarks, in desperation, he cUngs to what he hopes she means: 13) For the story, see Ovid Met. 7.402-24. 14) Davis (21) relies on these words to assume that the chorus is here tem- porarily absent; such a conclusion is surely illegitimate in a world as artificial as ancient tragedy. It is much easier to suppose that the chorus can simply share and not share the audience's perspective from time to time than that they are contin- uously making otherwise unmotivated exits and entrances.</page><page sequence="9">SENECA'S CHORUSES 569 amore nempe Thesei casto furis? a Une strangely misunderstood by Coffey and Mayer: "The dramatic weakness of this remark is that Phaedra has not described a chaste love in operation". The flood gates open: Phaedra declares her love openly describ- ing it (partly, perhaps, in a desperate attempt at justification) as her love for the young Theseus now restored to her in the person of Hippolytus. Hippolytus' reaction is, not surprisingly, one of extreme horror. An amorous approach by an older stepmother to her imma- ture adolescent stepson could have no other outcome; it is certainly not, in itself, evidence of misogyny, though it might prove to be the cause of it. Interestingly, during their violent exchange of words, Hippolytus reverts to Medea (696-7): genitor, inuideo tibi: Colchide nouerca maius hoc, maius malum est. He makes to k?l Phaedra with his sword; when she seems to wel- come this release from her pain, he flees in horror, leaving his sword behind because it is poUuted from having touched her. At this point, the Nurse takes control of the situation and begins to develop a strategy to accuse Hippolytus of rape, using the aban- doned sword and Phaedra's disheveUed state as evidence.15) Phaedra (733) has, meanwh?e, swooned away. There foUows a chorus celebrating the appeal of the beauty of young men iUustrated by numerous mythological examples. Its rel- evance here is obvious. Phaedra hats embarked on a hopeless course; the chorus serves to remind us of the power of Love that has brought this madness on. Once again, the chorus is not identified; but it is their message, not their identity that matters. As the choral song ends, the chorus reverts to iambic trimeters, first to reflect on the ev? plot hatched by the Nurse and now, it seems, endorsed by Phaedra, and then to announce the arrival of 15) Coffey and Mayer find the Nurse's reaction to be "without express motive" (155); I cannot, however, see why the audience cannot be allowed to infer from the situation that Phaedra's situation is very perilous and that attack might not really be the best method of defence. Euripides did indeed have an "express motive", but that is no reason to insist that Seneca should. Coffey and Mayer, with evident disapproval, conclude that "prudence motivates the Nurse to charge Hippolytus before he charges the women"; is that so difficult an idea for the audience?</page><page sequence="10">570 D.E. HILL Theseus (824-34). Once again, Coffey and Mayer are dissatisfied (155): "But, most surprisingly, the chorus who . . . ought not to have heard the Nurse's reflections, do not beUeve in Phaedra's charade (S. moreover does not account for her persisting in the charade once it has made its impact on the witnesses). They denounce it as a trick in plain terms (828)". Once again, the complaint assumes that the chorus should be integrated plausibly into the play. Is it that assumption or Seneca's technique that we should blame? Suffice it to say here that, at the conclusion of the passionate song on the appeal of youthful beauty, it seems natural for there to be a device to lead the audience back to the story proper; a subder point is that at 719-35 the plot was entirely the Nurse's; by now, as we learn from the chorus, Phaedra herself is fuUy impUcated. Astonishingly, Davis (21-2) reUes on the chorus's assertion that Phaedra is plotting against Hippolytus as proof that the chorus was absent when the Nurse devised the plot: "The chorus here reports the plot devised and put into effect by the nurse at the end of Act 3 (719-35). Phaedra cannot in any sense be held responsible for the plan since she is unconscious (733). The chorus members, however, attribute the plan to Phaedra. The chorus members' ignorance of the truth is itself evidence of their absence at the end of Act 3. Consequendy the chorus must have been withdrawn at some point during the act". But, for the plot to work, Phaedra must be involved. How else can she accuse Hippolytus of rape at 895-7? The shock- ing fact that Phaedra is herself falsely to accuse Hippolytus is the important issue here. The chorus is quite reasonably uninterested here on who thought of the idea first. Suddenly, we are confronted by an exhausted Theseus back from Hades and giving an account of his expedition there; he breaks off into puzzlement over the lamentations he can hear (835-53). The Nurse then appears and teUs him that Phaedra is threatening sui- cide (854-5). This section provokes an elaborate critique from Coffey and Mayer (155-6): "A third defect is Phaedra's suicide attempt, spoken of by the Nurse at 854-5. Once again no motive for this has been estabUshed. The Phaedra of Euripides resolved to die early on . . . and as soon as she heard the commotion in the house her resolution returned...; no appeals dislodge her decision. S'.s Phaedra leaves the stage in great agitation (734) but the unconvincing cha-</page><page sequence="11">SENECA'S CHORUSES 571 rade witnessed by the chorus (824-8) does not suggest a person bent on self-destruction; rather she appears to be getting ready to deceive someone, who opportunely turns up, her husband Theseus. (Of course she cannot have known he would return at this moment; once again Euripides had thought this point over, and so designed it that Theseus should be away only briefly on a sacred embassy. ..). The plain inference must be that the suicide attempt is also part of the trick. . . But the trick as a whole lacks motive just because the immediate return of Theseus could not have been predicted". There then foUows a general denunciation of Seneca's aUeged in- difference to dramatic technique. It is hard to know where to start in treating this jumble of error and false inference. First, in Rome, at least, suicide (or at least the threat of suicide) is a respectable woman's only acceptable response to rape. Livy's Lucretia is the best known example of this common- place. Thus, the threat of suicide is not something new that requires separate explanation, but an inescapable element in any feigned rape; also, a woman who has good reason to fear that her stepson is about to denounce her as a scheming would-be seductress wiU mount her counterattack immediately; she has no reason to await her husband's return, especiaUy if she does not know when it wiU occur; furthermore, Phaedra's enthusiastic embracing of the idea of being k?led by Hippolytus (710-2) must aUow us to wonder whether the threat of suicide is necessarily insincere. FinaUy, Euripides' drama is based upon a very different Theseus from the Senecan one. Euri- pides' Theseus is a brief absentee on a sacred embassy, not long gone on a disgusting expedition to ravish Persephone, an expedi- tion from which, plausibly, he would never return. Euripides' silence on any of the less savoury stories about him16) maintains the inter- est in Aphrodite's wish to punish Hippolytus; in Seneca, however, Theseus' misconduct is part of the cause of Phaedra's infatuation with her stepson; these considerations outweigh the points raised by Coffey and Mayer. After the Nurse has announced Phaedra's suicidal intentions, there is a passionate exchange between Theseus and Phaedra at the end 16) Theseus' prominent place in Athenian mythology may also contribute to Euripides' portrait of him.</page><page sequence="12">572 D.E. HILL of which he wrings out of her (as he thinks) the confession that her suicidal desires are prompted by Hippolytus' rape (863-902). Theseus' response (903-44) is a violent denunciation of his son, a torrent of abuse concentrating on what he perceives as Hippolytus' sanctimo- nious hypocrisy. It becomes more and more obvious that their rela- tionship had never been good. Theseus, the violent womaniser, was clearly repellent to a young son who retreated into innocent rural pastimes. When unprovoked, and in the absence of his father, he was the happy and innocent youth we encountered at the begin- ning of the play, not so very different from Phaedra's ideaUsed pic- ture of the young Theseus. His father, however, had clearly seen him as a prig and had resented his son's imp?cit (perhaps also expUcit) disapproval. At this moment, it becomes clear why Hippolytus can present either as the innocent adolescent or as the neurotic celi- bate; there is an element of truth in both characterizations. The curse (945-58) foUows the tirade, and Hippolytus' fate is sealed. There foUows a short choral ode (959-89) on the contrast between the orderly way in which the physical universe is governed and the whoUy disordered way in which man is governed, with the innocent suffering and the evil prospering:17) o magna parens, Natura, deum tuque igniferi rector Olympi, qui sparsa cito sidera mundo cursusque uagos rapis astrorum celerique polos cardine uersas, cur tanta tibi cura perennes agitare uias aetheris alti. . . res humanas ordine nuUo Fortuna r?git sparsitque manu mu?era caeca, peiora fauens. . . This is a reflection that might weU be in the audience's mind at this critical point. But, Uke so many of Seneca's choruses, it lacks the intensity of personal involvement. This gives the audience time and a philosophical framework within which to come to terms with their own reactions to the passionate scene just ended. 17) It is not, as Coffey and Mayer assert: "about the changeableness of fortune, one of the commonest themes in the tragedies".</page><page sequence="13">SENECA'S CHORUSES 573 There foUows the messenger speech recounting Hippolytus' horrific death (1000-17); it is framed by two exchanges between the messen- ger and Theseus. Two features resonate with what we have heard before, the messenger's appreciation of Hippolytus' beauty (1096 and 1110-4), and Theseus' emotional pain caught between disgust for what he thought his son had done and the love that only par- ents know (1122): quod interemi, non quod amisi, fleo. A choral song (1123-53) on the vicissitudes of Ufe and the particu- lar risks of ruin that face the rich and powerful then ensues. These are hardly novel sentiments, but they are crueUy apt here and must, again, articulate what the audience is feeUng, especiaUy an audience that must know that, for aU Theseus' pain now, there is far worse awaiting him. Once again, the chorus, in iambic trimeters (1154-5), introduces the next character to appear, a distraught Phaedra, clutching Hippo- lytus' sword and apparendy threatening suicide. At this point, Hippo- lytus' corpse is clearly on the stage. Once again, Coffey and Mayer are puzzled (17): "There is a major problem of consistency between Phaedra's final distraught lamentation and the scene that foUows. Theseus' initial question to Phaedra, asking why she laments over the hated corpse (1156-8) and her uncontroUable grief and remorse on seeing the mangled body (1198) presupposes that a recognizable part of the remains of Hippolytus had been brought in. The latter part of the messenger speech describes the gathering for funeral rites of the scattered pieces, but the formal funeral preparations over them do not occur until the final scene (1244-74)". The solu- tion, though gruesome, is clear. The messenger's speech reveals that the task of coUecting the whole body was unfinished (1109-10): necdum dolentum sedulus potuit labor explere corpus. It is this incomplete corpse over which Phaedra laments. Later, as the funeral approaches, parts of Hippolytus are stiU being brought in (1247-8): hue, hue, reUquias uehite cari corporis pondusque et artus temere congestos date.</page><page sequence="14">574 D.E. HILL It is reliquias that is the clue; this is not a general word for Hippolytus' remains, but a specific reference to the last remaining parts brought in in no particular order; at first (1256-60), attempts are made to restore each piece to its rightful place,18) but as the pieces, natu- raUy, become smaUer the task of finding their proper place becomes impossible (1265-8): hoc quid est forma carens et turpe, multo uulnere abruptum undique? quae pars tui sit dubito; sed pars est tui: hic, hic repone, non suo at uacuo loco. Thyestes The story of the Thyestes must have been famUiar to Seneca's audience. Tarrant (40-3) ?sts a considerable number of Greek and Latin tragedies on the subject that preceded Seneca's, ranging from those of Ennius and Accius (both known to Cicero) to that of Varius, a play of the Augustan era stiU admired by QuintiUan (10.1.98) and Tacitus (Dial. 12.6). A Senecan audience would, accordingly, be expecting horror, but nothing in the antecedents of this play would prepare them for an opening exchange in 121 Unes of iambic trime- ters between the ghost of Tantalus and a Fury.19) Tantalus, the wicked grandfather of Atreus and Thyestes, is forced against his w?l temporarily to leave his punishments in Hades to incite conflict be- tween his grandsons. There then foUows a chorus in first Asclepiads expressing the hope that Argos' troubles are over, and rehearsing the savage recent history of the Pelopid family. Tarrant comments (106): ". . . as the citizens of Argos brood over the grim history of their royal house ..." and Wading translates the opening Une of the chorus (122): 'If any 18) There is a long-standing dispute as to whether some of these lines should be assigned to the chorus; however, for what I wish to argue, nothing depends on how that dispute is resolved. 19) "The scene has no obvious model in extant Greek or Roman tragedy", Tarrant (86); he goes on to give a full and detailed account of the scene's impact. Once again, the instinct of the commentator is to note Seneca's departures from inherited norms, not as evidence of an exciting innovator, but as an, at best, neu- tral fact in need of explanation.</page><page sequence="15">SENECA'S CHORUSES 575 god loves our Achaian Argos . . .'. But there is nothing in the text to justify 'our' and, as Tarrant himself admits:20) "Nothing in the chorus's language marks it as old or young, male or female. Seneca is often less clear about the identity of his choruses than Greek dramatists . . . but here the lack of a specific persona may help the chorus's statements bear a wider relevance". But, whoever the cho- rus is,21) it is obviously appropriate at this point in the play for there to be expressions of hope, however desperate, and reflections on the history that has made those hopes so necessary and so des- perate. But, is the identity of the chorus of the shghtest significance? The assumption that the chorus are citizens of Argos would do no harm here; but their assumed continuity of identity causes trouble later. Why then make an assumption that is either unnecessary or embarrassing? There foUows a scene between Atreus and his servant in which Atreus stresses his passionate hatred for his brother, Thyestes, his determination to do him the greatest possible hurt, and his confidence that Thyestes feels exacdy the same way in return. The servant introduces aU the conventional counter arguments against injustice and cruelty, but he is whoUy rebuffed; his intervention serves only to inflame his master's passion. At first, Atreus' complaints are non- specific, but at 220 ff. he rehearses in detail his view of Thyestes' crimes, essentiaUy that he raped Atreus' wife and snatched his throne. The servant wants Atreus to be content with kil?ng Thyestes (245), but in the foUowing exchange it becomes only too clear that Atreus w?l be satisfied with nothing less than some extreme and barbarous punishment. At first, he cannot imagine what it is to be, but grad- uaUy an idea takes form. First, he remembers how Tereus was made to eat his own son (272-4), then it occurs to him that he can do even better by arranging for Thyestes to eat his chUdren with enthu- siasm: auidus.. .gaudensque (277-8). After the briefest moment of doubt (281-4), Atreus recovers his determination with the very spurious moral argument that it w?l be Thyestes, not he, who w?l perform the wicked act (284-7): 20) 106, ?. 1. Happily, a more sympathetic analysis of Seneca's practice. 21) Davis (58-63) argues that they are citizens of Argos ignorant about the pol- itics of their realm.</page><page sequence="16">576 D.E. HILL audendum est, age: quod est iam in isto scelere praecipuum nefas hoc ipse faciet. From now on, the servant concentrates only on how the crime is to be committed, not whether. By 335, the plot to entice Thyestes into the palace on the pretext of a feigned reconciliation is fuUy developed. The only issue on which Atreus wavers is whether or not to make his sons privy to the plot; after much hesitation, he decides not to. The servant is sworn to secrecy. There then foUows a chorus in glyconics (336-403) which has given much trouble to commentators. Their opening Unes reveal a knowledge of the alleged reconcUiation, but no knowledge of the plot that Ues behind it, in spite of their assumed 'presence' during the previous scene (336-8): tandem regia nobilis, antiqui genus Inachi, fratrum composuit minas. Richter22) deleted the Unes on the grounds that they violate plausi- b?ity and anticipate Unes 546-59. Others tread more warily; Wading,23) for instance, writes (60, n. 1): "That the chorus, here and again at 546, appear to be ignorant of Atreus' treacherous intentions, is a considerable strain on the dramatic convention. Some suppose that the chorus is absent from the stage between the acts. But no such reaUstic solution need be looked for; the chorus may participate as much, or as Utde, in the action as is convenient; here they are assumed to be aware only of the 'overt' situation?the apparent reconcUiation of the brothers". And Tarrant (138) similarly writes: "The chorus shows no awareness of the plot that the audience has just heard Atreus devise; it reacts only to the 'pubUc' report that Atreus has invited Thyestes to return from ex?e and be reconciled with him. [Seneca often treats his chorus as 'absent' between odes, an aspect of dramatic technique on which he differs markedly from the practice of fifth-century Greek tragedy...]". But how can Wading speak of a "dramatic convention" when we have only the plays of 22) L. Annaei Senecae Tragoediae recensuerunt Rudolfus Peiper et Gustavus Richter (Leipzig 1923). 23) See on n. 1.</page><page sequence="17">SENECA'S CHORUSES 577 Seneca to estab?sh the Roman 'convention' and when Seneca seems so frequendy to violate what Wading and others presume him to be foUowing? Tarrant at least acknowledges that he is basing his judgement on a comparison with Greek tragedy, but he too seems to regard the phenomenon as an awkward fact in need of smooth- ing over. Davis rehes once again on supposed choral absence (18): "But if we accept that a Senecan chorus may or may not be pre- sent during an Act the problem is more apparent than real. It is not difficult for us, especiaUy if we are an audience in a theatre, to grasp what has taken place. We can deduce that, being citizens of Argos, the members of the chorus have heard reports of the rec- oncUiation which is to take place between the two brothers. We know, however, from their visible absence from the stage in Act 2 that they are not privy to Atreus' true plans. The optimistic opening to the succeeding ode wiU cause an attentive audience no surprise at aU". But let us suppose instead that according to the Senecan con- vention choruses are often overtly anonymous and without coher- ent identity; and the chorus's task is to enunciate ideas that Seneca either assumes are in the audience's mind or wishes to put there. In this case, an audience fam?iar with the plot might weU enjoy the rich dramatic irony arising from ruminations on the joy the cit- izens would feel on accepting at face value the false reconcUiation. As we shaU see, dramatic irony is very important in this play. This chorus cannot understand how the brothers were driven to such hatred in the first place and goes on, very elaborately, to contrast the false kingship of the rulers of the world with the true Stoic king- ship enjoyed by the sapiens. In the persons of Atreus and Thyestes, this play presents the most extreme examples imaginable of non- Stoic kingship. The false optimism and deUberately gross incongruity of this ode could not fail to send a frisson throughout the audience. The next scene opens with a pathetic Thyestes and his three sons approaching the city. Thyestes knows of the offer of reconcUiation but deeply mistrusts it and is on the point of turning back. His eldest son, Tantalus, takes the reconcUiation at face value and urges his father on. Nothing in this scene can justify Atreus' portrait of his brother; on the other hand, Thyestes' pusiUanimous indecision is no closer to the Stoic sapiens than was Atreus' barbarous longing for revenge.</page><page sequence="18">578 D.E. HILL At 491, Atreus enters and de?vers a long aside to the audience (491-507) exulting in the imminence of his revenge. Tarrant's com- ment (161) is interesting: "The speech is a briUiandy original cross- ing of two dramatic conventions, the entrance-monologue of late Euripides and New Comedy. . . and the 'eavesdropping aside' of New Comedy, in which a character makes unnoticed remarks about his own intended actions or about the behavior of other characters on stage before a dialogue begins . . . Seneca reverses the usual pat- tern of having a character already on stage comment aside on a new arrival and extends the aside to a length unparalleled even in Plautus. The result may be 'untheatrical' by certain standards, but it is undeniably effective, displaying both Atreus' absolute control of the situation and his keen enjoyment of his power over Thyestes". Once again, however, assumptions are made about the "conventions" on no evidence at aU. If there were developments from Greek tragedy to New Comedy, why do we have to suppose that the conventions then froze waiting only for Seneca to flout them? Is it plausible that poets such as Ennius, Accius, Varius and Ovid, aU of whom wrote tragedies now lost except for fragments, introduced no innovations, and chaUenged none of the conventions of fifth century Attic tragedy? Tarrant righdy sees that the arrival of Atreus on stage immediately deUvering a long aside is "undeniably effective" and must suggest an immensely strong character?imagine the demands it would make on the actor. But why does he feel at the same time that he must concede that it is "'untheatrical', by certain standards"? Would it not make more sense to suggest that Seneca is a brilUant exploiter of the conventions of his age? And why do commentators strain at the gnat of the unnoticing chorus while swaUowing the camel of the unnoticed aside? Only, I suspect, because the latter is appar- endy canonized by Classical usage while the former is found only in Seneca. Atreus turns to Thyestes and graduaUy cajoles him into accept- ing his offers of forgiveness, friendship and a share in the kingdom (507-45). At this point, the chorus launches into a joyous ode in Sapphic hendecasyUables celebrating the new-found and unexpected peace between the brothers (546-9): credat hoc quisquam? ferus ?le et acer nec potens mentis truculentus Atreus</page><page sequence="19">SENECA'S CHORUSES 579 fratris aspectu stupefactus haesit. nuUa uis maior pietate uera est... The dramatic irony of this chorus is magnificent; the audience, knowing what is in store, are confronted by a chorus expressing the natural view of those who have not been taken into Atreus' confidence. Again, nothing is gained by giving the chorus an identity; in a mod- ern film, the director would cut to a street scene of deluded citi- zens rejoicing in the expectation of 'peace in our time'; the Senecan flexible use of the chorus enables him to achieve the same effect though, in the later stages of this chorus (596-622), with the joy tinged, as Tarrant observes (169), with "anxiety. . . suppressed rather than aUayed". The Messenger scene (623-788) is magnificent, but hardly con- troversial. It is foUowed by a chorus (789-884) in anapaestic tetram- eters (and occasional dimeters) wondering why the sun has fled and left the world in darkness. The true explanation is, of course, as the Messenger has just explained (776-8), the Sun's horror at the events described. Once again, Tarrant is interesting (204): "The ode is closely bound to the dramatic situation, but in one respect it remains oddly detached from its surroundings. At no time does the chorus seem aware of the actual cause of the phenomena that alarm it, even though the Messenger has just expUcidy connected the dark- ness with the sun's horror at Thyestes' banquet... It is almost as if the chorus that took part in the previous scene is a different entity from the lyric voice of the ode . . .". Once again, the assumption that the chorus should have a coherent identity produces difficulties that have to be awkwardly explained away. How much better to assume that there is no such coherent identity and that the ode, Uke the others, dweUs on thoughts that must be imagined to have been felt by remoter onlookers, not privileged, Uke the audience, with fuU information. At the end of the chorus, the audience is confronted by a demonic Atreus who de?vers a speech in iambic trimeters of the most appalling cruelty and gloating triumphaUsm (885-919). As the speech ends, Atreus draws our attention to Thyestes (perhaps behind a door now opening) drunk, happy and replete, singing in anapaestic dimeters (920-69), first about his joy, then about nameless fears he cannot understand; the dramatic irony is overwhelming; as for the tone of</page><page sequence="20">580 D.E. HILL the song, I cannot better Tarrant's comment (221): "The scene is a harrowing portrayal of psychological disintegration, unique in ancient Uterature and, for aU its grotesque exaggeration, uncomfortably real". The final scene between Atreus and Thyestes needs no particu- lar comment here; the eventual d?nouement is further delayed (more dramatic irony) by a teasing exchange in iambic trimeters between the brothers (970-1021) during which Thyestes becomes more and more distressed by his fears. EventuaUy, at 1021-3, Atreus reveals the truth of what he has done, and the play ends with bitter recrim- inations between the brothers (1024-1112), a scene in which we rea?ze that the only difference between the world at the beginning of the play and the world now is the death of Thyestes' sons. Troades The first 66 lines of the Troades are devoted to a monologue by Hecuba in iambic trimeters in which she laments her state after the faU of Troy and reveals to the audience that we are at the point, after Priam's murder, when the Greeks were deciding which of the Trojan women should be assigned as booty to which of the Greek heroes. There then follows a choral interlude described by Fantham thus (220): "Seneca's sequence of invocation and response between Hecuba and the chorus is unhke any Greek choral interlude in form or content". Once again, the reader might be forgiven for won- dering whether these comparisons are reaUy helpful. The exchange between Hecuba and the other captive Trojan women (for there can be no doubt that the chorus in this exchange reaUy does have that identity) is extremely moving as it catalogues the disasters that have overwhelmed them. Suddenly, however, at the end we are uphfted by 22 Unes (142-63) of defiant hope in which first Hecuba, then the chorus, rejoice in the happy after Ufe now enjoyed by Hector, Priam and the other dead Trojan heroes. Next, Talthybius appears and, in a narrative that refers to the other Greeks in the third person (165), teUs the chorus (they speak at 166-7) of terrible portents culminating in the appearance of Achules bursting from the underworld and demanding that Polyxena be sacrificed over his grave. AU commentators acknowledge the obvi- ous fact that in this scene Talthybius is alone with the chorus. Fantham argues that "it is his purpose to convey this news to them",</page><page sequence="21">SENECA'S CHORUSES 581 but goes on to admit, correctly, that nothing is made of that fact. Surely, the real purpose of Talthybius' speech is to convey horror and information to the audience; the presence of the chorus aUows Talthybius to speak naturally with the audience overhearing as bystanders. If Talthybius addressed the audience direcdy, it would tend to break the suspended disbeUef. Talthybius' scene is immediately foUowed by an entirely separate scene (203-370) involving only Pyrrhus, Agamemnon and, eventu- ally, Calchas. Before they enter, Talthybius must depart. Fantham sees a problem (240): "It would be simple ... for Talthybius to turn on his heel and exit on one side of the stage, while the indignant Pyrrhus entered expostulating to Agamemnon from the other wings; but this would present an impossible sequence for the chorus. They had no caU to leave during Talthybius' answer to their questioning. Are they to turn taU and foUow him offstage?" Once again, the assumption that Senecan choruses provide continuity leads to prob- lems; once again, it seems prudent to question that assumption.24) Quite simply, Senecan practice seems to assume an ever-present, or usuaUy present, chorus which does not necessarily represent any continuity either of identification or of knowledge gleaned from their witnessing of the play. In a magnificent rhetorical display, Pyrrhus bludgeons Agamemnon into reluctandy agreeing to ask Calchas if it is right for Pyrrhus to obey the order of his dead father and sacrifice Polyxena at AchiUes' tomb. Chillingly, Calchas not only endorses Pyrrhus' request but adds an unexpected rider, that Hector's son, Astyanax, must be hurled to his death from the remaining tower of Troy.25) The chorus that immediately foUows (371-408) has worried com- mentators deeply: whereas the earUer chorus had proclaimed confident faith in a blessed afterUfe for the innocent (142-63), this chorus, 24) Davis (25-6) also believes that the chorus is absent during the Pyrrhus, Agamemnon, Calchas scene partly because he thinks that their absence would facil- itate what he assumes to be necessary, a change of scene from the Trojan camp to the Greek one, and partly because he believes that the chorus immediately fol- lowing the scene makes more sense as a reaction to Polyxena's imminent death (announced by Talthybius) than to that of Astyanax (not revealed till the later scene, at 368-70). 25) Agamemnon's condemnation of Calchas at Iliad 1.106-8 will speak for almost anyone who has to do business with him.</page><page sequence="22">582 D.E. HILL with equal confidence, proclaims that there is no Ufe after death. The attempts to reconcile these two choruses have given rise to some extraordinary mental gymnastics. Davis, for instance, argues (25-6): ". . . the chorus's radical shift in view on the nature of the soul's destiny is best understood as a reaction to Talthybius' announce- ment of Achilles' demand that Polyxena be sacrificed: whereas the beUef in an after Ufe helped to make Priam's death tolerable, that same beUef can only make the prospect of Polyxena's death and marriage to AchiUes intolerable". Fantham takes a quite different approach (263): "Nothing has happened to motivate this change of heart by the chorus, and neither the Troades nor any Trojan hero- ine wiU abandon in the later acts the assumptions of Ufe after death that this contradicts . . . Thus we must conclude that this ode is not spoken by the Trojan women but from outside the dramatic action, to convey a philosophical antidote to ancient superstition". She goes on to suggest that, because Andromache's subsequent report of Hector's appearance to her (438-56) turned out to be unavaiUng, the immediate context is more consistent with disbeUef in the after- life; this, surely, is to clutch at straws. As Fantham herself goes on to point out, Seneca himself hved in a time when beUef and disbeUef in an afterUfe coexisted. It would be entirely natural for him to explore both points of view in discussing these extremes of suffering. If his audience knew that continuity was not to be part of their expectations for the chorus, none of these worries would afflict them and there would be no need to posit something "from outside the dramatic action". It should also be pointed out that the first chorus is deeply em- bedded in the action and uses first person verbs no less than seven times, and nostris once, in ways that guarantee their identity with the Trojan captives (67-70): non rude uulgus lacrimisque nouum lugere iubes: hoc continuis egimus annis, ex quo tetigit Phrygius Graias hospes Amyclas. and (73-4): decies niuibus canuit Ide, decies nostris nudata rogis.</page><page sequence="23">SENECA'S CHORUSES 583 and (80-2): uulgus dominam u?e sequemur: non indociles lugere sumus. and (99-100): soluimus omnes lacerum multo funere crinem. and (114-5): non sum soUto contenta sono: Hectora flemus. and (157): 'felix Priamus' dicimus omnes. The second chorus has the form of a whoUy non-specific consolatio appUcable to any tragic situation and ending with a strong Epicurean flavour (407-8): quaeris quo iaceas post obitum loco? quo non nata iacent. Furthermore, its use of the first person is quite different, serving to identify the chorus not with any particular group but with the whole human race, as at (376-9): non prodest animam tradere funeri, sed rest?t miseris uiuere longius? an tori morimur nuUaque pars manet nostri . . .? and (388-90): quo properat modo obliquis Hecate currere flexibus: hoc omnes petimus fata. and (394-6): ut nubes, grauidas quas modo uidimus, arctoi Boreae dissicit impetus: sic hie, quo regimur, spiritus effluet.</page><page sequence="24">584 D.E. HILL and (400): tempus nos auidum deuorat et chaos. Wfhat is the likely effect of these two choruses upon the audience? I suggest that the first chorus leaves us upUfted by man's abUity to look forward with hope in even the most bleak circumstances; a knowledgeable audience wiU, however, view this hope with real fore- boding reminiscent of other Senecan choruses, e.g. Thyestes 546-95. The second chorus invites us to relate the plot to our general view of the world; it is a vehicle for ph?osophical speculation, not for the expression of grief endured by characters in the play. As the chorus ends, Andromache and Astyanax enter. Andromache speaks (409 ff): quid, maest? Phrygiae turba, laceratis comas miserumque tunsae pectus effuso genas fletu rigatis? leuia perpessae sumus, si flenda patimur. As a speech to captive Trojan women, these words seem whoUy appropriate. But the words are a whoUy inappropriate response either to the first chorus which ended, as we have seen, in defiant triumphaUsm or to the second chorus, a rather ph?osophical reflection on the release from fear brought about by disbeUef in the afterUfe. Tearing of hair, breast beating and weeping are very hard to asso- ciate with either of these choruses. Once again, the assumption of continuity in Senecan choruses produces an embarrassing result. In the next section of the play (409-813), the chorus is sUent. Andromache makes plausible attempts to save Astyanax from his fate; UUxes deploys his usual guUe and cunning to outwit her. By the end of the section, Astyanax is being led away from a distraught Andromache. It would be a cold audience indeed that was not emo- tionally wrung dry by that scene. What is to foUow, Helen's prepa- ration of Polyxena for her 'wedding' to AchiUes' ghost together with the reactions of Andromache and Hecuba (861-1008), w?l be equaUy harrowing. The need to interpose a brief respite is overwhelming, which is precisely the function of the next chorus (814-60). AU three of the translations immediately available to me26) refer to the women 26) The Loeb of Frank Justus Miller (London and New York 1917), and the Penguin of E.F. Wading, and Fantham's.</page><page sequence="25">SENECA'S CHORUSES 585 in the first person; there is, however, nothing in the Latin that requires this27) and everything in its style and matter to forbid it.28) The chorus speculates in very formal language, fuU of geographi- cal doctrina, on where the various women wiU be sent. Sparta, Argos, Mycenae and Ithaca (853-7) are identified as especiaUy undesirable. The manner of this chorus is the manner of a concerned but s?ghdy aloof friend, it is not the manner of women desperately worried about their fate. If it were, the sustained passion would be hard for the audience to cope with. As it is, the chorus reminds them that there is the fate of the less important women to consider, but it allows for passions to subside a litde before the next overwhelming scene. Once again, the presumption of choral continuity produces a most implausible outcome. The next chorus (1009-55), just Uke the last one, is a Sapphic ode; it is, as Fantham observes,29) almost unique among Seneca's tragic choruses in foUowing another chorus in the same metre. This fact alone might encourage us to think that this chorus does have continuity with the last. Their contextual simUarities are clear; both odes immediately foUow harrowing scenes each of which is clearly to be the prelude to a dreadful outcome, the sacrifice of Polyxena and the kil?ng of Astyanax. Neither chorus makes any reference to the specific issues that must immediately be engaging the audience, the fates of Polyxena and Astyanax, but, instead, reflect in a rela- tively detached manner on related but peripheral issues, the first on the ultimate destination of the women, and the second on the propo- sition that misery loves company so that their imminent separation from Troy and from one another is seen as especiaUy painful. Both odes certainly provide respite from the harrowing scenes that pre- cede, separate and foUow them; both odes seem, in style and con- tent, to be most implausible as expressions of the feeUngs of captive women. The first of these two odes was analysed above; the first section of the second (1009-41) is devoted to ?lustrating the propo- sition that misery loves company with reference to the evidence of 27) At 844, Fantham introduces a first person singular but only by accepting Madvig's pergam for the traditional ueram. 28) It should, perhaps, be noted that the two Euripidean models for this cho- rus (Hec. 443 ff. and Tro. 188 ff.) are cast unequivocally in the first person. 29) 357; she attributes this point to W. Marx, Funktion und Form der Chorlieder in den Trag?dien S?necas (Cologne 1932), 16.</page><page sequence="26">586 D.E. HILL both myth and common experience. Finally, at 1042-55, the ode addresses itself to the circumstances of the drama; once again, there is no first person verb; the very cUmax of the ode detaches the cho- rus from the women (1055): Troes hoc signo patriam uidebunt. There is, however, one serious problem with this analysis; just at the point where the chorus turns from the general proposition that misery loves company to its appUcation to the faU of Troy their words are (1042): soluet hunc coetum lacrimasque nostras sparget hue ?luc agitata classis. The manuscripts divide between supporting coetum and questum. Fantham prefers coetum partly because there has been hitherto no complaint but chiefly because, without it, there is no proper pro- gression of thought. The argument must be that whereas the Trojans' suffering had been relatively tolerable because they were together, now that they are to be separated the agony w?l increase. The prob- lem, of course, is nostras. Without that one word we would have two consecutive odes in the Sapphic metre both commenting, as outsiders, on the pUght of the Trojan captives and never once identifying with them. It is not just that nostras spoils the analysis proffered here; nostras fits Ul with the tone and content of both odes. I am, accordingly, tempted to suggest that we read not nostras but uestras; the error would have arisen from haplography (-que uestras) giving questras then 'corrected' to -que nostras perhaps assisted by an early assumption that the members of this chorus were indeed the women of Troy. The final scene belongs to the messenger who recounts most mov- ingly the two disasters we have been awaiting from almost the begin- ning of the play. The courage and dignity of Astyanax and Polyxena in the face of death Unger in the mind. Both act fuUy in the spirit of the ph?osophical musings of the chorus, but they utterly tran- scend their trite homiUes. Epilogue It would be tempting, if repetitious, to pursue this analysis through- out the Senecan tragic corpus. However, readers should have Utde</page><page sequence="27">SENECA'S CHORUSES 587 difficulty in applying these simple principles for themselves. Instead, I should Uke to sum up, first by quoting Davis again (39): "When the members of a tragic chorus entered a Greek or Roman stage the first questions, we may surmise, Ukely to occur to an audience were, 'WTio are these people?' and 'Why are they here?'". However, as I hope to have shown, at least in the case of Seneca, such ques- tions produce absurd results. The proper way to estabUsh the con- ventions of any art form is to estabUsh which assumptions are helpful and which are not. It would not be helpful, at the cinema, to ask of the musicians as we hear them on the soundtrack "WTio are these people?" and "Why are they here?". And if the musicians suddenly move from the major key to the minor we know that the bUssful characters on the screen are about to encounter disaster. We do not, however, say to ourselves, "Can't they hear the music?" nor do we say, "How do the musicians know what is about to hap- pen?" It seems to me that Senecan choruses perform a sim?ar func- tion. They can be involved as characters in the play, just as a film can exploit the music direcdy as, for instance, in West Side Story. Alternatively, the chorus can evoke an emotion or a train of thought relevant to the action but deUvered in a whoUy unreaUstic way; and the same is true of film music. Sometimes the intervention presents a very na?ve view and produces a form of dramatic irony, some- times the intervention w?l be more detached and philosophical. The scope for Seneca's chorus or for film music is boundless. In this piece, I have tried to show something of the range of Seneca's cho- ruses and something of the way in which, properly interpreted, they can enhance an audience's appreciation. It should never be for- gotten that the modern art form most closely modeUed on ancient tragedy is neither the theatre nor the cinema, but the opera. It would not be helpful, at the end of La Boheme, to enquire, "If she is so unweU, why is she wasting her breath in song?"30) Newcastle University 30) Earlier versions of this paper were read to meetings of the North-East Classical Research Seminar, and of the Glasgow branch of the Classical Association. It was also read to an invited audience in Bologna through the good offices of Professor G. Calboli. I should like to express my thanks for the many improve- ments suggested by members of those audiences. In particular, I should like to acknowledge the very helpful observations and encouragement of my colleagues, Professor PJ. van der Eijk and Dr S. Phillippo.</page></plain_text>
