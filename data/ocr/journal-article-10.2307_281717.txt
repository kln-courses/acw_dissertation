SIBERIA As in the past, the primary emphasis in this periodic review of Siberian research will be accorded to the Paleolithic period because of its importance to the early prehistory of the entire New World. However, research on the post-Paleolithic era, which is pertinent to both the early and late prehistory of the North American Arctic/Subarctic, will continue to receive some cov- erage. In recent years, Soviet archaeologists have made sig- nificant progress in the development of Siberian Pa- leolithic cultural chronology. There is increasing evi- dence of earlier Upper Paleolithic and Mousterian industries in the south-central regions; traces of pre- Mousterian settlement remain confined to previously reported finds from Ulalinka and several other local- ities. A Mousterian assemblage has been described by Z. A. Abramova from the important rockshelter site of Dvuglazka in the Upper Yenisei area, while other Mousterian occupations have been reported from the Altai region (e.g., Strashnaya and Denisova caves). Al- though no absolute dates currently are available for these sites, the faunal remains from Dvuglazka reflect relatively warm and dry climates and may antedate the Last Glaciation. Overall, the Mousterian of Siberia ap- pears comparable to the Mousterian industries of west- ern Eurasia, exhibiting widespread use of Levallois technology and assemblages rich in side scrapers, points, denticulates, and other typical tool forms. Occupation horizons that may be assigned to the earlier Upper Paleolithic have been excavated at sev- eral localities including Ust'-Kova (Angara River), Tolbaga (Khilok River, Trans-Baikal), Varvarina Gora (Bryanka River, Trans-Baikal), and others. Upper Pa- leolithic layers at these sites have produced radiocar- bon dates in the 35,000-25,000 B.P. interval. (The dating of previously reported Upper Paleolithic sites in this time range from the Aldan Valley is viewed with skepticism by many Soviet researchers.) In contrast to the later Upper Paleolithic of Siberia, microblade tech- nology is rare; tools on large blades and Mousterian tool types are common. Some assemblages also contain bone and antler tools (e.g., points and needles) and evidence of art. Most Siberian Paleolithic sites may be dated to the Last Glacial Maximum (25,000-14,000 B.P.) and Late Glacial (14,000-10,000 B.P.); occupations dating to the latter period particularly are common. The later Upper Paleolithic industries reflect a heavy emphasis on microblade technology, although, unlike the late Upper Paleolithic of Europe (including the European 417</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY USSR), Mousterian tool types continue to play a sig- nificant role in the Upper Paleolithic assemblages of Siberia. Sites in western Beringia (i.e., east of the Ver- khoyansk Range) are of special interest to American archaeologists. Although occupations in this region re- main confined to the Late Glacial period, it is impor- tant to note that N. N. Dikov has defined two separate complexes here: an older complex lacking microblade technology, but containing bifacial projectile points, and a younger microblade industry, similar to both the Dyuktai Culture of the Siberian interior and the Denali Complex of Alaska. The following review covers the 1984 and 1985 field seasons, and is based on the Arkheologicheskie otkry- tiya volumes for those years. WESTERN SIBERIA (INCLUDING THE ALTAI). N. F. Lisitsyn (Institute of Archaeology, Leningrad Branch, USSR Academy of Sciences) continued work at the Novoselovo site group, located on the first terrace (left bank) along the upper Yenisei River (Krasnoyarsk kraj), during 1984-1985. In 1984, 50 m2 were exposed at Novoselovo XIIa, revealing two occupation hori- zons separated by a sterile unit. The upper horizon is deposited at a depth of .95-1.75 m in light gray sandy loam and contains well-preserved longbone and cranial fragments of reindeer and bison. The artifact assem- blage is composed of single and double platform cores, point fragments, burins, large end scrapers, and small side scrapers. Lisitsyn tentatively dates this component to the second half of the Last Glacial Maximum, and assigns it to the Kokorevo culture. The lower horizon (only 17 m2 of which was exposed) is deposited .85- .90 m below the upper occupation level in a bed of gray bedded sandy loam containing reddish bands. A former hearth pit, filled with wood charcoal, was un- covered in this horizon; small fragments of bone and artifacts (small single platform cores, flakes, and a bu- rin) were found concentrated near this feature. During 1985, the focus shifted to Novoselovo XIII, where 80 m2 were exposed (bringing the total area ex- cavated at this site to 1,200 m2). Three occupation horizons have been identified, the uppermost of which is deposited at a depth of .92-1.05 m in light gray sandy loam and contains remains of reindeer and bison. The artifact assemblage includes pebble and "butt-end" cores, points, burins, end scrapers, and retouched blades, and it is reportedly typical of the final stage of the Kokorevo culture. The second horizon occurs in a red- dish marker band at a depth of 1.48-1.55 m; faunal remains are limited to small bone fragments. The ar- tifact assemblage comprises pebble and "butt-end" cores, small retouched blades with backed edges, and tools of reindeer antler, and it also is assigned to the Kokorevo culture. The lowermost horizon is deposited at a depth of 1.92-2.0 m in bedded sandy loam and contains a former hearth pit filled with wood charcoal. Small bone fragments, pebbles, and artifacts (flakes and fragments) were found concentrated around the former hearth. Lisitsyn dates this level to the first half of the Last Glacial Maximum and compares the inventory with the nearby site of Tarachikha. S. A. Vasil'ev (Institute of Archaeology, Leningrad Branch, USSR Academy of Sciences) continued ex- cavation of sites in areas that will be inundated by construction of the Majninskaya hydroelectric project in the upper Yenisei Valley. During 1984, attention was focused on the Majninskaya site, which is located on the second (15 m) terrace near the mouth of the Uj River; 10 excavation units, covering an area of 36 m2, were exposed. A Neolithic assemblage containing pris- matic cores, bifacial points, and end scrapers is de- posited in the moder soil layer, which extends to a depth of .4 m. Paleolithic Layer A, comprising 3 sep- arate horizons at depths of .9, 1.0, and 1.1 m below the surface, lies below the modern soil in a sand unit. Two former hearths were discovered in the lowermost horizon. Paleolithic Layer B lies at a depth of 1.7 m, and contains three former hearths. Layers C and D occur in a bed of alluvial sands at depths of 1.9 and 2.2 m respectively; they contain only isolated remains. The artifact inventory from the Paleolithic levels is relatively homogeneous, and includes single and dou- ble platform, discoidal and wedge-shaped cores, a va- riety of side scrapers, and end scrapers on flakes; non- stone artifacts include a bone point, antler "hammer," and canine tooth (fox?) pendant. Vasil'ev dates the Paleolithic levels to the terminal Pleistocene, and as- signs the remains to the Afontova culture. During 1985, the 1981 excavation area at Uj I (also located on the second terrace) was expanded. The up- permost horizon at this site, which contains only sparse remains, rests at a depth of 1.0 m. The second occu- pation horizon (54 m2 exposed) is deposited in bedded alluvial sands and loams at a depth of 2.7-2.8 m; it is composed of three subhorizons, the lower two con- taining substantial quantities offaunal debris, artifacts, charcoal, and ocher. The artifacts include single and double platform cores, blades, side scrapers, and end scrapers on flakes. Vasil'ev observes that the artifact inventory is similar to that of sites of the Afontova culture. V. K. Vistingauzen conducted a joint exploration (Altai University and Altai Branch, Geographic Soci- ety of the USSR) of five caves in the Krasnoshchekovo rajon in the Altai. Pleistocene faunal remains were orig- inally collected from these caves in 1831-1834. Two of the caves (Zagonnaya and Bol'shaya Khankharin- skaya) contain Paleolithic artifacts. The former has produced 19 items, including an end scraper on a blade fragment (tentatively assigned to the Upper Paleolith- ic), and the latter has yielded a single worked stone. CENTRAL SIBERIA. S. G. Vasil'ev (Chita Ped- ological Institute [CPI]) undertook new excavations in 1985 at the important Upper Paleolithic site of Tol- baga, located on the second terrace along the middle course of the Khilok River (southeast of Lake Baikal). A new area (5.0 x 4.0 m), situated approximately 20 m southeast of the old excavations, was exposed. The site occupies a relatively steep slope (10-12?), and the remains, which are contained in colluvial sediment, appear to have been subject to some redeposition. Al- though the modern soil, and to some extent the un- derlying chestnut-colored sandy loam, have been dis- turbed by plowing, the lowest unit (light brownish sandy loam) remains relatively undisturbed. These 3 units average .3-.4 m in thickness, and have produced 13, 418 [Vol. 54, No. 2, 1989]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH 19, and 29 artifacts respectively. The inventory in- cludes cores and tools on large blades or blade frag- ments (5-10 cm long); among the latter are splintered pieces, retouched blades, a backed knife, and a burin on the corner of a snapped blade. A. V. Konstantinov (CPI) conducted excavations at Ust'-Menza II, located on the second terrace at the confluence of the Chikoj and Menza rivers, during 1984- 1985. A total area of 224 m2 has been exposed (max- imum depth of 7.0 m), and 17 occupation horizons have been discovered to date. Horizons 1 and 2, which are deposited in the moder soil and underlying chest- nut-colored sandy loam, contain ceramics and other items related to the Bronze Age. Horizon 3 is deposited in colluvial (?) sand, and has produced a burial and artifact assemblage assigned to the Mesolithic-Neo- lithic transition. Horizons 4-17 are contained in thin silty bands (.01-.02 m thick), separated by sterile bands (.05-.50 m thick), representing flood-plain alluvium. Faunal remains from these levels include deer, horse, and wolf. The artifact assemblages are composed of wedge-shaped cores, microblades, small end scrapers, burins, perforators, choppers, bifaces, and splintered pieces on flakes. The remains of possible former struc- tures have been reported from horizons 4 and 7. Kon- stantinov assigns horizons 4-17 to the Upper Paleo- lithic, and suggests that they probably date to the second half of the Last Glacial Maximum. M. V. Konstantinov (CPI) reports the 1985 discov- ery of Mousterian artifacts from the fourth terrace of the Menza River. The stratigraphy at this locality (Ust'- Menza V) was exposed to a depth of 7.0 m and studied by S. M. Tsejtlin, I. N. Rezanov, and L. D. Bazarova. Most of the exposed section is composed of bedded alluvial sands (5.8 m thick), the upper portions of which exhibit signs of ice-wedge formation. The alluvium is capped with colluvial sands and the modem soil ho- rizon. Five silt bands containing faunal remains were observed in the middle of the alluvial facies; according to N. P. Kalmykov, the fauna includes rhinoceros and horse. The silt bands also yielded several possible stone artifacts, including a hammerstone (?) and side scraper (?). This material may date to 70,000-50,000 B.P. Items of undoubted human manufacture were recovered from a band of rubble at the contact between the alluvium and colluvium. The artifacts, which appear to be re- deposited, comprise crude subprismatic cores (2), worked nodules (2), a blade-like piece, flakes (11), and side scrapers (2). Konstantinov suggests that they may represent a late Mousterian industry. The overlying colluvium contains isolated artifacts believed to be of Holocene age. N. M. Cherosov (Yakutsk University) investigated several sites on the Middle Lena River (Olekminskij rajon) during 1985. Among these was Patomskaya Cave, which contains six occupation horizons. Horizons 1- 4 have been assigned to the Neolithic and post-Neo- lithic, and horizons 5 and 6 have been assigned to the Upper Paleolithic. Artifacts from the Paleolithic levels include a conical core, a multi-faceted burin, and a knife-biface fragment from Horizon 5 and a wedge- shaped core blank, a subprismatic core, pebble tools, and numerous flakes (quartzite and diabase) from Ho- rizon 6. At the site of Ust'-Olekmo, a wind-abraded end scraper (quartzite) was found in slope deposits on the 100 m terrace; Cherosov tentatively has assigned this artifact to a pre-Upper Paleolithic industry. EASTERN SIBERIA (INCLUDING THE SOVIET FAR EAST). R. S. Vasilevskij and S. A. Gladyshev (Institute of History, Philology, and Philosophy, Si- berian Department, USSR Academy of Sciences) con- tinued excavations at Ustinovka I (located at the mouth of a tributary stream along the Zerkal'naya River in the Primor'e kraj) during 1984. A total of 30 m2 was exposed, and three horizons were distinguished. The first horizon (contained in yellow clay with occasional fragments of argillite and volcanic tuff) yielded cores (2), flakes (292), blades (38), debitage (82), and tools (4). The second horizon (contained in a band of dark brownish clay with numerous fragments of tuff) pro- duced cores (21), flakes (1,573), blades (181), debitage (1,770), and tools (9). The third horizon (very compact, chocolate-colored clay), which was found to be absent in the northern portion of the excavation, yielded an assemblage of cores (9), flakes (378), blades (38), and debitage (825), but no tools. The cores are prismatic (single and double platform) with parallel blade facets; two wedge-shaped core blanks are reported. The tools from the first two horizons include diagonal burins, side scrapers (on large flakes), points, and unifacial tools; with the exception of the side scrapers, they were prepared on blades (siliceous tuff). The site remains undated, although it generally is believed to be assign- able to the Late Pleistocene. N. N. Dikov (Far East Scientific Center, USSR Acad- emy of Sciences) conducted survey and limited exca- vation in Chukotka during 1984-1985. In 1984, survey work was concentrated along the Kus'yuveem and Kym'ynanonvyvaam rivers. Material collected from the surface of the left-bank terrace at Kus'yuveem IV and VI included crudely worked side-scraper-like and hand-axe-like implements thought to be relatively old (i.e., Paleolithic) on typological grounds. Wedge-shaped cores and bifaces were recovered from Kym'ynanonvy- vaam VII and XIV (on the left-bank terrace); these assemblages are similar to the industry at Ushki I, Layer 6 (on Kamchatka) of terminal Pleistocene age. Surface collections from the sites of Kus'yuveem XI- XIII (right-bank terrace) include crude flint flakes and blanks, technologically comparable to the Paleolithic material from Ul'khum. The remaining sites discov- ered during the 1984 survey are assigned to the Neo- lithic. In 1985, Dikov conducted excavations at several sites in the region between Cape Chaplin and Provi- deniya. At Puturak, located on the watershed between the Tkachen and Itkhat rivers, both surface finds and subsurface remains were recovered. The surface ma- terial included a substantial quantity of debitage, typ- ically in the form of blade-like flakes, and various tools on blade-like flakes and large "knife-like" blades. A 4.0 x 2.0 m excavation revealed a buried occupation horizon at a depth of .4-.6 m containing traces of a former dwelling in the form of a dark circular stain. Inside this feature, many artifacts are concentrated around a former hearth pit. The assemblage comprises large subprismatic and conical cores (10), burins, end 419</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY scrapers, knives, and other items, and is compared by Dikov to the early Holocene industry at Anangula in the Aleutians. M. A. Kir'yak (Far East Scientific Center, USSR Academy of Sciences) conducted investigations in 1984 at Bol'shoj Nuteneut I-III. These sites occupy moraine crests near Bol'shoj Nuteneut Lake (Anadyr rajon, Ma- gadan oblast'). Bol'shoj Nuteneut II produced a Neo- lithic assemblage containing prismatic and conical cores, points, knife-like blades, circular end scrapers, adzes, and ceramic fragments. Excavations at Bol'shoj Nu- teneut III uncovered two former hearths associated with pottery fragments and splinters of reindeer long- bone. Artifacts were also collected from Bol'shoj Nu- teneut I (conical cores, knife-like blades, and multi- faceted burins); Kir'yak assigns this assemblage to the early Neolithic. A. M. Kuznetsov (Ussuri Pedological Institute) con- tinued excavation at the Gorbatka III site in the south- western Primor'e kraj during 1985. A total area of 300 m2 has been exposed over the course of three field seasons, and both Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic as- semblages are thought to be present. Artifacts re- covered from sandy loam underlying the modern soil have been assigned to the Bronze Age and earlier. Be- neath the sandy loam lies a bed of compact loam con- taining numerous large fragments of basalt; this unit has yielded an assemblage comprising prismatic and wedge-shaped cores, boat-shaped blanks, ski spalls, flakes, blades, many end scrapers, and burins. Kuz- netsov has dated the lower component to the terminal Pleistocene. John F. Hoffecker FAR NORTH Exceptionally interesting research was undertaken in the Far North in 1987. Attention particularly is di- rected to work by Alan Boraas, William Workman, Peter Zollars, and Richard Jordan in the Kachemak Bay/Kodiak Island area. Here the richness of archae- ological sites, and their sheer size, seem almost incred- ible to those of us working in bleaker, less-blessed areas. The traditional paradigm of Eskimo prehistory has seen the Bering Sea coast as the focus of Eskimo cultural development, with the Pacific area relegated to a si- deshow. But now the evidence of much denser popu- lations in the Pacific Eskimo area seems to be com- pelling, and it suggests that the importance of this area has been much underrated. SOUTH COASTAL ALASKA. Jean Aigner and Lydia Black (University of Alaska, Fairbanks [UAF]), Douglas Veltre (University of Alaska, Anchorage [UAA]), and Allen McCartney (University of Arkan- sas) continued protohistoric and ethnohistoric research in the Aleutian Islands, analyzing data collected in 1985 and 1986 on Unalaska and nearby islets. Fieldwork resumed in 1988. Of particular interest are the new data on settlement size and house diversity, as well as the differential frequency of Russian voyages and con- tacts in the Aleutian Islands between 1743 and 1799. In 1987, Alan Boraas (Kenai Peninsula College) car- ried out excavations at 049-SEL-010, on the southern coast of Kachemak Bay, on the Kenai Peninsula. The two-component site was tested originally by Frederica de Laguna in 1931, who interpreted the lower com- ponent as Kachemak III tradition (Eskimo) and the upper as a late prehistoric Indian house pit. Boraas's excavations confirm this interpretation. In addition, two carbon samples from the upper component, which is interpreted as Tanaina (Dena'ina) Indian, date to A.D. 1440 ? 60 and A.D. 1175 ? 60, respectively. A single '4C date from the base of the lower Kachemak III component dates to A.D. 10 + 70. William Workman and Peter Zollars (UAA) directed a crew of between seven and ten in five weeks of ex- cavation at the Yukon Island Fox Farm site (SEL 041), also on the Kenai Peninsula of Kachemak Bay. Kris- tine Crossen and David Yesner (UAA) joined the proj- ect for the last two weeks of the season, and will analyze the recovered geological and faunal data respectively. Thirty-six 1-m2 units, many of which had been opened in previous years, were excavated to depths of up to 3 m below ground surface. The base of the occupation, which should date to the mid- to early first millennium B.C., currently is subjected to salt-water immersion during the higher tide cycles, indicating considerable local subsidence in the area. After three seasons of testing, work in 1987 focused on reaching unambigu- ous bottom in several units at the center of the 60-m2 excavation area and on completing the definition of a burned house feature encountered in 1986. About 1,450 artifacts, abundant faunal remains, and scattered hu- man bones were recovered. Column samples spanning the occupation of the site also were taken. Although remains of a rich nineteenth-century historic Tanaina Athapaskan village were found in the surficial sedi- ments at the site, attention in 1987 focused on the underlying Kachemak tradition occupation (Pacific Es- kimo), which should date between ca. 1,500 and 3,000 years B.P. The 1987 work provided additional evi- dence (bone fishhook shanks, clay-lined storage basins, and other materials) for the presence on this site of an individual or group from the closely related, but re- gionally distinct Kachemak tradition of the nearby Ko- diak archipelago. Animal bones suggest a more pelagic character for the fauna than has been exhibited in other Kachemak Bay sites, with porpoise, seal, sea otter, hal- ibut, salmon, and shellfish as major dietary constitu- ents. Significant numbers of caribou bone suggest mainland foraging expeditions as well. The Kodiak Archaeological Project, directed by Richard Jordan (Bryn Mawr) and supported by the National Science Foundation and the Kodiak Area Na- tive Association, completed its fifth consecutive year of research in 1987. Excavations at Larsen Bay con- centrated on the removal of five single-roomed Ka- chemak houses estimated to date within the latter part of the first millennium A.D. The long-term goal of this part of the project is to gain an understanding of Late Kachemak village life and, if possible, make sense out of the enormous collections by Ales Hrdlicka at this site in the 1930s, now housed at the Smithsonian In- stitution. Jordan's surveys around Karluk Lake and the upper 420 [Vol. 54, No. 2, 1989]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH portions of the Karluk River documented several large prehistoric Koniag villages. The largest contains 63 multiple-room houses and stretches for a mile down the Karluk River from its outlet. There was also an exceptionally large Kachemak village at this site that contained 47 visible Kachemak houses. Still larger sites are located at the opposite end of the river; for example, one site contains 171 visible Koniag houses and stretches for a mile. To date, surveys along the Karluk system and the adjacent areas of Sturgeon Lagoon and Uyak Bay have documented 79 definite Koniag sites, with 483 visible sod house structures, and 51 Kachemak sites with 270 visible structures. The majority of the research efforts, however, fo- cused on continued excavations at KAR- 1, located along the southern shore of the Karluk Lagoon. KAR- 1 is a 4-m-deep Koniag "wet site" dating between A.D. 1200 and European contact. One research goal is to inves- tigate the nature and development of ranked society. Seven superimposed sod houses of varying sizes were excavated in 1987, bringing the total number of ex- cavated houses to 16. Work in 1988 confirmed earlier observations that a dramatic increase in religious par- aphernalia begins about A.D. 1400, with the inception of the multiple-room-house form. Masks, maskettes, mask bangles, anthropomorphic figurines, drum parts, and so forth are reasonably common artifacts. The most intriguing find of the summer, however, was a wooden figurine with human hair that apparently de- picts a woman in the act of giving birth. An archaeological survey of 19 timber-harvest units on northern Prince of Wales Island, southeastern Alas- ka, was carried out by Bruce Ream and Becky Saleeby of the University of Alaska Museum. No archaeolog- ical sites were discovered within the units, but inves- tigations in adjacent areas resulted in the location of three archaeological sites and three fossil shell locali- ties. One of the sites was an extensive fishweir com- prised of sharpened wooden stakes embedded in over a mile of tidal flats along a cove on the northeastern part of the island. One stake collected from the site was 14C dated to 3220 ? 60 B.P.-the oldest date from a fishweir in southeastern Alaska. INTERIOR ALASKA. Jean Aigner and Roger Powers (UAF) assessed a protohistoric Athapaskan site on Bull Island, near Tanana. The deeply stratified site contains four major occupation zones. Bone and bark are well preserved throughout the 2-m-deep sequence. In 1987 Jean Aigner and Ralph Lively (UAF) com- pleted a final season of work at the Chugwater site, near Moose Creek Bluff. The materials have proved to span the Holocene and terminal Pleistocene. Stratigraphy is compressed with artifact distributions and radiocarbon dates confirming occupation in the terminal Pleisto- cene, middle Holocene, and late Holocene. ARCTIC CANADA. Jeff Hunston (Yukon Heri- tage Branch) completed the third season of the North Coast Heritage Research and Protection Project on Herschel Island and the Yukon North Slope. The re- search is funded by the Northern Oil and Gas Action Plan (NOGAP) and included field staff from the native communities of Pelly Crossing and Old Crow, who excavated an early twentieth-century sod and drift- wood house in the historic whaling settlement at Pauline Cove (NjVi-3). A faunal collection of over 20,000 spec- imens is being analyzed by Zooarchaeological Identi- fication, National Museum of Natural Sciences. The artifact collection of over 2,000 specimens represents a frontier mixture of Euroamerican and Canadian im- ports as well as traditional native artifacts. Consider- able recycling of raw materials salvaged from the Triton (1895) wreck is evident. The field data will supplement archival information in providing a substantive basis for future interpretive programming in the new Her- schel Island Territorial Park. Hunston also tested the Avadlek Spit site (NjVj-1), where he identified two late prehistoric/protohistoric sod and driftwood houses with abundant faunal re- mains, artifacts, and intact floor structures. Further work on these houses is planned in 1989. Inventory and assessment on the mainland coastal plain and North Slope continued, with a focus on the area east of Kay Point. A large number of historical- period driftwood burials were identified and recorded on the coast between Sabine and Shingle points. The graveyard at Shingle Point was recorded. It provided evidence of "cultural mimicking" of Euroamerican/ Canadian grave-headboard construction. A number of historical-period and prehistoric sites were identified in the Running and Caribou river drainages on the North Slope. Further evidence of Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt) penetration of the Barn Mountains to the rim of Old Crow Flats is provided by the recovery of a stemmed ASTt endblade from the mouth of Wood Creek. Four other archaeological projects in Arctic and Subarctic Canada were funded by NOGAP. During the 1987 field season, Raymond LeBlanc (then of the Archaeological Survey of Canada [ASC], cur- rently of the University of Alberta [UA]) continued NOGAP archaeological inventory and test excavations in the Mackenzie Delta area. The main areas of re- search were the Tuktoyaktuk and Cape Bathurst pen- insulas. Work on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula included the testing of two sites and a limited survey in which 21 sites were found. Test excavations at a prehistoric Mackenzie Inuit site (NkTm-1) located at the bottom of Hutchinson Bay were supervised by Murielle Nagy (UA), with other work at NjTj- 1 on a Pleistocene chan- nel south of McKinley Bay. The latter site yielded an assemblage of microblades, burins, and core tablets that suggests the presence of the Northwest Microblade tradition. Survey by LeBlanc on the Cape Bathurst Peninsula resulted in the discovery of 47 sites, most of them along the old Horton channel. One (OaRw-2) had a large caribou bone midden of unknown cultural affiliation, as well as two muskox skulls and an unexpected wood bison cranium (Bison athapascae [C. R. Harington, personal communication 1987]), with cut marks be- tween the horn cores. Test excavations also were un- dertaken at a Pre-Dorset site (ObRw- 11), where burins, microblades, microcores, and fragments of serrated endblades indicate the Arctic Small Tool tradition. Another site (ObRv- 1) produced a variety of bone and antler tools including bilaterally barbed, open-socket harpoon heads, which virtually are identical to speci- 421</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mens from the formerly unique, late ASTt variant rep- resented by the Lagoon site (OjRl-3) on Banks Island. More intensive investigation of these sites is planned. David Morrison (ASC, Canadian Museum of Civi- lization [CMC]) worked at the Iglulualuit site (NlRu- 1), located near the mouth of the Horton River, on the eastern coast of the Cape Bathurst Peninsula. This work was again supported by NOGAP, with supplementary funding by the CMC. Iglulualuit is one of the largest sites known from the western Canadian Arctic, with the remains of at least 30 winter houses. Two houses were excavated, yielding artifacts that suggest a late prehistoric Mackenzie Inuit cultural affiliation. Al- though the area was unoccupied historically, Stefans- son recorded traditions about the site from the neigh- boring Avaaqmiut of Cape Bathurst. Taken in conjunction with the archaeological data, they suggest a previously unknown Mackenzie Inuit "society" in the Franklin Bay area during the late prehistoric period. The demise of this group during the early nineteenth century served to increase the geographic isolation be- tween the Mackenzie Inuit and Copper Inuit to the east, and hence between the Western and Central Es- kimo cultural patterns. Hansjurgen Miiller-Beck (University of Tubingen, West Germany) returned to the Umingmak site on Shoran Lake, northern Banks Island, after an absence of about 15 years. Umingmak is a large Pre-Dorset muskox-hunting site; 1987 fieldwork was aimed at gathering more information relating to the dating and seasonality of the site. James Helmer (University of Calgary) visited the Jones Sound area of northern Devon and southern Ellesmere islands. Two Dorset sites were briefly in- vestigated at Cape Skogn, Devon Island, and an ex- tensive Thule occupation was recorded from Smith Island, off the southeastern coast of Ellesmere. Susan Rowley (Smithsonian Institution) excavated at Ungaluyat, a large, nineteenth-century Inuit site on the southern coast of Igloolik Island. Fifteen large stone circles, an inuksuit line, and many caches were spread over an area of about 800 x 60 m. Fourteen of the 15 stone circles functioned as dwellings, while the fifteenth was identified by elders as a summer qigiq, or meeting and dancing place. One of the dwellings was excavated. Pat Sutherland (Northland's Research) undertook helicopter survey and test excavations along the south- eastern coast of Devon Island, under contract to CMC's NOGAP project. Reconnaissance between Stratton In- let and Cape Sherard on Lancaster Sound resulted in the discovery of 90 new sites. Six were surface col- lected, and test excavations were conducted at two Thule sites at Lemieux Point. New techniques in the taking and interpretation of air photos, designed for location of archaeological sites, also were tested. In 1987, Douglas Stenton (UA) conducted archae- ological surveys and test excavations in the southeast- ern corer of Amadjuak Lake, Baffin Island. The work was undertaken as part of a multidisciplinary project investigating the geology, climate, and vegetation of the interior of south-central Baffin Island. It provided additional information about the human ecology of the interior of Baffin Island and a comparative data base for the three summers of research on Nettilling Lake further north. Thirteen archaeological sites were re- corded, including one which may be the important summer camp of the Nugumiut (Frobisher Bay) Inuit that Boas mentions in The Central Eskimo (1889). Test excavations conducted at four sites produced small but significant faunal and artifact assemblages. Although no diagnostic artifacts from the Paleoeskimo period were recovered, chert flakes were found in several fea- tures, suggesting a long history of seasonal use of the area. Semisubterranean houses as well as ground slate indicate Thule occupations, and several sites yielded evidence of protohistoric and historic occupations. Features include heavy tent rings, stone fox traps, boul- der caches, semisubterranean houses, and large stone kayak frames. Most of the sites were located where caribou, fish, and waterfowl could be taken during the summer and fall. Stenton has now recorded 100 ar- chaeological sites in interior Baffin Island, convincingly demonstrating the importance of inland areas, and es- pecially caribou, to the subsistence and settlement practices of both prehistoric and historic Arctic people. Anne Keenlyside (UA) continued investigation of Inuit burials at Kekerten, a whaling station in Cum- berland Sound, Baffin Island dated to ca. 1840-1915. As well as osteological research, the project involved the cleaning and restoration of the graves, many of which were badly disturbed. The sex and age of each individual were determined, as well as any pathological indications. It was determined that the Kekerten Inuit suffered from ailments such as arthritis, bone fractures, and tooth abcesses. However, the historically docu- mented diptheria epidemics, which probably resulted in the death of many, left no observable osteological evidence. Father Guy Mary-Rousseliere (OMI, Pond Inlet) continued his more than 20 years of archaeological work on northern Baffin Island this summer. Work at the major Dorset-Thule site of Nunguvik concentrated on a large middle Dorset component. At nearby Ar- nakadlak, organic ASTt artifacts were recovered, in- cluding harpoon heads and needles. The site has been radiocarbon dated to ca. 3,555 years B.P. With the support of the Social Sciences and Hu- manities Research Council, the Polar Continental Shelf Project, and the Arctic Institute of North America, members of the Ellesmere Island Research Project re- turned to the eastern coast of Ellesmere Island after a five-year absence. 1987 fieldwork was codirected by Karen McCullough (Calgary) and Peter Schledermann (University of Victoria), with the assistance of visiting scholars Charles Arnold (Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre [PWNHC]) and Eric Damkjar (UA). In the Bache Peninsula region, field research was car- ried out on Knud Peninsula, Skraeling Island, and the northern coast of Johan Peninsula. Helicopter, boat, and foot surveys resulted in the discovery of new fea- tures and sites, including a 10.8 m Late Dorset com- munal or ceremonial dwelling on the northern shore of the Flager Bay polynya- an area of open water which attracts migratory waterfowl, seals, and walrus during the summer and fall months. Five Late Dorset com- munal features have been discovered in the vicinity of this polynya. The primary research objectives in the Bache Peninsula region were the investigation of pos- 422 [Vol. 54, No. 2, 1989]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH sible occupational contemporaneity of Arctic Small Tool tradition dwellings located on different beach terraces within the same site area, and the gaining of more information about seasonality of occupations. Evi- dence of early ASTt dwellings from six sites revealed the existence of a variety of dwelling styles and hearth configurations. The great danger in relying too strongly on local beach-ridge chronology was demonstrated by the discovery of roughly contemporaneous features, particularly from the early ASTt period, at various elevations above sea level. In addition, they found im- pressive continuity of the axial-construction principle regardless of the presence of "true" slab-lined, parallel- axial walls. One tentative conclusion regarding ASTt dwelling structures, whether vaguely defined camp fea- tures or more substantial slab-lined axial features, is that most of the winter period was spent in snow houses and that the more sheltered axial dwellings were used principally during the late fall and early winter. A one-day survey in the Goding Bay area, about 110 km south of Alexandra Fiord, produced evidence of abundant archaeological resources relating to a great number of prehistoric occupations and migrations along the east coast of Ellesmere Island between Makinson Inlet and Smith Sound. Several recent-looking sod, stone, and whalebone winter-house ruins may have been built and occupied by a group of Baffinlanders who, under the leadership of the great shaman Qit- dlarssuaq, immigrated to the Thule District of north- western Greenland in the 1860s and attempted an un- successful return to Baffin Island several years later. Further research in the Goding Bay area on this well- documented migration and earlier settlements will pro- vide important information on the nature of prehis- toric population movements in the eastern High Arctic and Greenland. SUBARCTIC CANADA. N. A. Easton and R. M. Gotthardt conducted a brief survey of the Fort Selkirk town site (KeVd-2), Yukon Territory, on behalf of the Yukon Government Heritage Branch. The principal objective was the location and mapping of historic fea- tures in the town site area; testing for evidence of tra- ditional and prehistoric occupations was preliminary in nature and was undertaken to mitigate planned sta- bilization and reconstruction of historical-period struc- tures. The historic Hudson's Bay Company post of Fort Selkirk, established by Robert Campbell in 1851 and pillaged the following year by Chilkat traders, was relocated in the town site and briefly tested. Significant structural features include the base of three chimneys and burned planks (flooring?), some in a well-preserved state. A few artifacts were found, including trade goods and cobble spall scrapers. Elsewhere, results do not add significantly to MacNeish's (An Introduction to the Archaeology of Southeast Manitoba, 1958) earlier observations on the Fort Selkirk site. Artifacts representing contact or pro- tohistoric occupations were recovered principally at the base of the humus zone; prehistoric lithics occurred at the base of the humus and throughout the B horizon. Processing implements dominated the artifact collec- tions, including cobble spall and unifacial scrapers. A hearth feature found at the base of the humus horizon has been '4C dated to 100 ? 80 B.P. Sheila Greer (Edmonton) was involved in a study of native sites for the Yukon Heritage Inventory, a mul- tiyear site-recording program sponsored again by the Yukon Heritage Branch. Working with local infor- mants, site-recording work was undertaken along the Nisultin River corridor in the Teslin area, and at Ethel Lake near Mayo. These two pilot studies collected in- formation on camp histories and locations, place names, and land-use data, as well as on native perspectives on heritage site recording. Jean-Luc Pilon (ASC, CMC) returned for a third season of archaeology sponsored by NOGAP in the lower Mackenzie Valley area. A greater emphasis was placed this season on the excavation and testing of sites than in previous years, when the focus was more on reconnaissance. These excavations were designed to provide some basic information that will enable plan- ners to assess carefully the potential impact on heritage resources by future oil and gas development in the Mackenzie Valley. Results have been encouraging. Be- fore the 1987 field season only a single Athapaskan semisubterranean house was known from the entire Mackenzie Valley; 35 features have now been docu- mented that share characteristics suggesting they too were pit houses. Radiocarbon dating places these struc- tures within the last millennium, with some apparently constructed following the introduction of steel axes (af- ter the late eighteenth century). Evidence attesting to older occupations dating back as far as 3,000 years also have been documented at a number of localities. Chris Hanks (PWNHC) worked further up the Mac- kenzie Valley, conducting rescue operations on the of- ficers' quarters of Fort Franklin. The fort was built and used by the Second Franklin Expedition as winter quar- ters on Great Bear Lake during the years 1825-1827. He confirmed the identification of the structure and indicates that the fort was placed at a major fishery that had a long history of native use. Hanks also worked on a Clovis site on the T'logotsho Plateau in the Mackenzie Mountains, near Nahanni National Park. The site is one of a series discovered along a high valley where game was hunted at salt licks. In addition, quarry sites were found where cobbles of chert were being mined and bipolarly reduced. Heinz Psyzczyk (Archaeological Survey of Alberta [ASA]) conducted surveys and text excavations adja- cent to the Peace River, near Fort Vermilion, Alberta. Approximately 30 prehistoric and five historical-pe- riod sites were located, including Boyer's Post, the first trading post in the area (1788?). Many prehistoric sites were found on former channels of the Peace River, on oxbow lakes some distance from the current river, along which the bulk of historical-period sites occur. Prehis- toric sites mostly appear to date to the last 4,000 years, though some Paleoindian sites probably remain to be discovered. Near High Level, Alberta, Milt Wright (ASA) reports the perfectly preserved bones of an extinct form of bison, recovered from a 4-m-deep backhoe trench, and dated to 10,000 years B.P. Further work will be un- dertaken to recover additional bone specimens and to verify the context of the find. No cultural associations 423</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY have been discovered for the paleontological site, but the presence of bison during the early Holocene sug- gests the potential for early human presence. Survey within the "ice free corridor" of northwestern Alberta was also initiated by Wright as part of ASA's five-year First Albertans research project. Artifacts from over 70 private collections in the Grande Prairie and Peace River region illustrate 11,000 years of human occupation. Paleoindian occupation is represented by several small fluted and basally thinned points, plus extensive collections of Hell Gap and Cody Complex artifacts. The middle and late prehistoric periods are well represented, dominated by the Plains artifact va- rieties also seen in southerly regions of the province. Further survey and test excavation should determine site distributions and locate buried deposits with dat- able contexts. Michael Forsman (ASA) continued excavations at the site of Fort Chipewyan III (ca. 1803-1964), an important fur-trade site that served as headquarters of the Athabasca District and as a depot supplying the more distant Peace and Mackenzie river posts. Exca- vations were completed on the factor's house, on which construction began in 1872. This building was found to overlie parts of the 1803 fort. This complex and long-term site has ruins demonstrating architectural evolution and a range of cultural materials not re- covered previously from other fur-trade sites. Moira McCaffrey (McGill University) continued work in the Schefferville region of northern Quebec and west- ern Labrador within the chert-rich Labrador Trough. The goal has been to locate and characterize lithic source localities, in order to investigate lithic procurement and exchange patterns in the interior eastern subarctic. Over the past four seasons, 17 prehistoric workshop and habitation sites have been located near outcrops of high-quality green, gray, and tan-colored cherts. The largest site, GaDp-2, is at the junction of Menihek Lake and the McPhadyen River in western Labrador. During the summer of 1987, limited excavations were carried out in five zones of this site. Most were chert work- shops, but one area produced a sand and cobble hearth covered with a thick deposit of red ochre. Tools col- lected from the beach fronting the site suggest affilia- tions with late Archaic, Intermediate, and Recent pre- historic period Indian groups. Preliminary analyses of both cultural and geological material suggest the need to reexamine past assumptions about the lack of high quality, knappable stone in the interior of Labrador. Economic and technological reasons alone cannot ac- count for the appearance on interior sites of stone im- ported from very distant sources. Jean-Yves Pintal (Quebec, P.Q.) continued research in the Blanc-Sablon area, on the mainland shore of the Strait of Belle Isle. The ancient shore of the Blanc- Sablon Valley (9000-5000 B.P.) was surveyed to in- vestigate the nature of initial settlement in the area. Twenty-five sites containing numerous artifacts were discovered. Most appear to date to the period 7000 to 5500 B.P., with dates of 7050 ? 250 (on site EiBg-5 1), 6180 ? 90 (site EiBg-53), and 6210 + 100 (EiBg-53). The first site contained a hearth with calcined bones of small mammals (Muridae), birds (Phasianidae), and fish (Gadidae). Pintal also investigated the late Mari- time Archaic period (3000-2500 B.P.). Activity fo- cused on site EiBg-43, the association with this period being confirmed by four radiocarbon dates. This site contained three spatially and temporally separated components. Large, low fireplaces, containing much rock and charcoal, are striking, along with numerous flakes (ca. 25,000) and tools (230). The only associated faunal material is baleen. David A. Morrison NORTHWEST BRITISH COLUMBIA. Millennia Research (Sid- ney, B.C.) conducted a study of culturally modified trees in the Newcastle Block, northern Vancouver Is- land, on behalf of the B.C. Resource Management Branch and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. High densities of bark-stripped western red cedar, plank-stripped stand- ing trees, and "detritus" from aboriginal logging were found. Spatial distribution of bark-stripped trees and logged trees differs. The bark-stripped trees cluster near the shore and logged trees are all located 200 m or more inland. Two outstanding features of the more than 100 tree- ring dates are the absence of dates after 1847 and a large "spike" in 1798. The apparent cessation of ab- original forest utilization in the 1840s is attributed to large-scale population movements known to have oc- curred during this period. An earlier hiatus between 1740 and 1780 might represent the initial displacement of Salish speakers by the Kwakiutl people. Hypothet- ically, the large number of 1798 dates represents an unusual harvest, perhaps associated with a potlatch. The continuation of a chisel technology and rejection of Euroamerican logging tools and techniques at least until the 1840s are consistent with the long-standing conservative approach of Northwest Coast cultures to technological change. A report on this research is on file at the Resource Management Branch, Victoria, B.C. Kathryn Bernick (University of British Columbia) directed a volunteer crew in a successful rescue oper- ation that salvaged over 400 waterlogged wood and bark artifacts from a previously unknown wet site (DgRs 30) in Tsawwassen, B.C. The objects, including bas- ketry, cordage, netting, wood wedges, bentwood fish- hooks and other items, were hydraulically "excavated" from a 120-m3 pile dredged from a pond on the Beach Grove golf course. Lack of context limits interpretation, but radiocar- bon dates and the analysis now in progress should help relate the assemblage to the regional prehistoric se- quence. Preliminary evaluation indicates similarity to 3,000-year-old specimens from the Musqueam North- east site in the Fraser delta and to artifacts more than 2,000 years old from the Biederbost site near Seattle. OREGON. Mike Southard (BLM, Eugene District) conducted limited test excavations at four small sites (150 m2 to 2,500+ m2) in the western Cascades of Oregon. Three sites are located in the middle or lower Mckenzie River drainage. The fourth is located in the lower Middle Fork Willamette River drainage. 424 [Vol. 54, No. 2, 1989]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH The sites are characterized by shallow cultural de- posits, low artifact densities, and assemblages with a limited number of tool types. The assemblages from three sites are consistent with flaked-stone-tool man- ufacture and maintenance. The assemblage from the fourth site contains a few cobble tools (choppers and a cleaver) in addition to the hunting implements. Temporally sensitive projectile points from the Mill King site warrant assignment to the Late Archaic pe- riod (A.D. 200-1750). Point fragments from the other sites were too incomplete to serve as temporal markers. J. Jeffrey Flenniken and Terry L. Ozbun (Lithic An- alysts, Pullman, WA) conducted research on lithic scat- ters in central and western Oregon (Ochoco, Deschutes, and Willamette National Forests). Results indicate that Archaic and Late Prehistoric inhabitants of these re- gions utilized technological systems involving staged manufacture and systematic rejuvenation of projectile points at many different locations on the landscape. Lithic manufacturing stages generally include reduc- tion of bifacial or cobble cores to produce flake blanks for further reduction to projectile points or other tools. Differences among lithic assemblages at particular sites reflect the shape, size, and quality of the raw materials utilized, the distance to the source, the nature of ac- tivities performed, and cultural traditions of flintknap- ping. Excavations by Lithic Analysts in the Newberry Cra- ter Quarry Complex revealed differential use of Ho- locene obsidian flows of several ages. A paleosol within the crater produced an Early Archaic lithic assemblage associated with a radiocarbon date of 8210 ? 60 B.P. Thomas J. Connolly (University of Oregon) supervised several different projects under contractual agreement with the Oregon Department of Transportation. Con- nolly and Brian O'Neill directed excavations at the Long Tom and Chalker sites in the Long Tom River basin west of Eugene. There are three distinct occu- pation periods. Period I was represented at the Long Tom Site by a rock and charcoal feature and a single obsidian scraper. The feature dated to 8890 ? 120 B.P., the oldest 14C date from western Oregon. Period II dates between 4,500 and 3,500 years ago. This period is best represented at the Long Tom Site by many roasting ovens that contained charred camas bulbs, hazelnuts, and acorns. The assemblage includes broad- necked stemmed and foliate projectile points, cobble hammerstones, pestles, and stone bowl fragments. On the magnetometer map of 6,800 m2, 40 percent of the 173 anomalies recorded were strong dipolar anomalies representing historical-period metal debris; 58 percent were monopolar anomalies of low to moderate inten- sity. Sixteen (70 percent) of 23 monopolar anomalies tested corresponded to buried oven features. Based on this sampling, an estimated 101 such oven features existed within the magnetically mapped area. Period III, best represented at the Chalker Site, dates from 2,000 to 300 years ago. In contrast with Period II, the Period III occupation is characterized by a relatively high frequency of chipped-stone tools, especially pro- jectile points. There is infrequent evidence of buried plant-processing ovens or ground-stone tools. The Indian Grade Spring Site is located on the west- ern slopes of the Stinkingwater Mountains, which form the northern boundary of the Great Basin. The site, excavated in the summer of 1987 by Connolly and Dennis Jenkins, is in a partially deflated loess dune. Three components were distinguished. The lowest components, 2 and 3, were contained within well-con- solidated deposits and have reasonably good integrity. Component 1, within the unconsolidated surface silts, consists of remains of late occupations mixed with ear- ly material from deflated deposits. Radiocarbon dates from Component 3 range from 2,000 to 1,400 years ago. Component 2 is dated to about 1,150 years ago by a pooled charcoal sample and Component 1 dates to about 530 years ago. Rose Spring, Elko, and large side-notched points are present in all three compo- nents. Connolly and Robert Musil excavated three sites near the Quartz Mountain divide, between the Klam- ath Basin and the northern Great Basin in south-central Oregon, during the fall of 1987. The sites, all situated at the valley edge just inside the treeline, are located near the Drews Creek/Butcher Flat obsidian source. All were extensive scatters containing a high propor- tion of chipping debris and relatively few formed tools, primarily projectile points, quarry-reduction bifaces, and expedient flake tools. Preliminary analysis indi- cates a relatively low proportion of cortex, suggesting that primary reduction was done at quarrying points and secondary reduction was done at valley-edge hunt- ing camps. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the sites were used primarily during the past 1,000 years, though there is a date of 4730 B.P. from a lower level of one site. Projectile points include both broad-necked and narrow-necked forms, including Elko and Rose Springs types as well as contemporaneous forms more familiar within the Klamath Basin. Connolly and Richard Cheatham excavated at the Williamson River Bridge site in the spring of 1988. The site is on the north bank of the Williamson River near Chiloquin, Oregon. Preliminary analyses suggest that the inhabitants' subsistence efforts were directed largely toward riverine resources, primarily suckers and freshwater mussels. Small bipointed bone tools, thought to be the remains of composite fishhooks, and large, grooved net sinkers provide further evidence of fishing. The camp probably was occupied in the spring during the seasonal runs of suckers. Presently available radio- carbon dates suggest episodic use, about 7,000 years ago, again at 2,200 years ago, and, finally, within the past 100 years. Excavations at Mitchell Cave, a small rockshelter in the upper John Day River drainage, were conducted during the summer of 1988 by Connolly and Dennis Jenkins. As the interior had been vandalized, exca- vations were concentrated on the landing in front of the shelter. Undisturbed strata contained at least two discernible components. The upper stratum dates to about 200 years ago and the lower dates between 1,000 and 1,400 years ago. Faunal and tool assemblages in- dicate a temporary hunting camp. The artifact types exhibit closest formal similarities to Columbia River types. Two sites on the upper Rogue River east of Trail were excavated during the summer of 1988 by Con- nolly, Richard Cheatham, and Brian O'Neill. Chipped 425</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY stone tools and debitage dominated the assemblage from site 35JA190. Recovered projectile points include both early and late prehistoric styles. Three compo- nents were distinguished at site 35JA189. The earliest contains broad-stemmed points and is associated with the basal deposits in the site. The middle component is associated with a cobble-littered living surface. Pro- jectile points include Gunther series types and both small and midsized side-notched types. The uppermost component contained Gunther series projectile points, pottery (bowl and figurine fragments), and fragments of a decorated steatite pipe. IDAHO. Robert Lee Sappington and Priscilla We- gars (University of Idaho) conducted a preliminary test at Canoe Camp (10CW25) for the National Park Ser- vice. Members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition built five canoes for the final segment of their westbound trip to the Pacific Ocean while camped on the Clear- water River. Sappington and Wegars tried to determine whether evidence of the expedition could be found archaeologically, whether there was evidence for the interaction between expedition members and the Nez Perce, and whether a prehistoric site existed at the location. No evidence for any occupation dating to the early nineteenth century was found, but an extensive late prehistoric component was discovered. Sappington directed excavations at two sites along the Lochsa River in north central Idaho for the Idaho Transportation Department. The Pete King Creek site was an extensive camp occupied intermittently for the past 2,500 years. Most lithic tools relate to mainte- nance of hunting kits. Faunal remains indicate that deer and elk were the major animals exploited. Exca- vations at the Beaver Flat site produced projectile points and other lithic tools referable to the Cascade and Win- dust phases (ca. 10,000 to 4,500 years ago). Artifacts were found both within and below a deposit ofMazama ash that dates ca. 6,700 years B.P. Radiocarbon dates will provide better control over the dating. Larry Kingsbury, Jeff Fee, and Mona Wright (Payette National Forest) excavated and made surface collec- tions at the Chinese Terraced Garden Complex in the Warren, Idaho, mining district. A small Ah Toy hab- itation ruin was completely excavated and they re- covered thousands of artifacts from historical-period and prehistoric deposits beneath a 1913 Forest Service guard station. The research provides a basis for inter- pretative displays. Survey provided additional infor- mation about the Chinese in northern Idaho. The Pay- ette National Forest is offering a challenge grant to encourage public-sector involvement in archaeological investigation of these Chinese cultural properties. In- terested persons should contact Larry Kingsbury, the forest archaeologist, at (208) 634-8151. The brevity of this section does not reflect the extent of fieldwork in the Northwest. The deadline for this section came at an awkward time, when many aca- demic archaeologists still were in the field or between fieldwork and classes. In September 1988, many Forest Service archaeologists were working on fire lines. Another important event for archaeology in the North- west this past year was the discovery of an assemblage of fluted points (Clovis or Clovis like) near Wenatchee, Washington. The geologic context of the material was documented and there are other cultural remains still in situ. The chapter on Paleoindians in the Northwest probably will be rewritten in the near future. Frank Leonhardy CALIFORNIA AND THE GREAT BASIN OREGON. William J. Cannon (BLM, Lakeview District) and Mary Ricks (Portland State U.) have iden- tified over 250 rock-art localities for the Lake County Rock Art Inventory. Sites are mapped and recorded, petroglyphs photographed and sketched, and associ- ated archaeological materials described. Site infor- mation is entered into a computer data base for inter- site comparisons. One site contains a substantial, complex panel of deeply carved abstract petroglyphs buried by a deposit ofMt. Mazama ash (ca. 6900 B.P.). Further excavation will be necessary to confirm site stratigraphy, but it appears that rock art has been an important part of aboriginal culture for more than 7,000 years. While rock art often is found in sites associated with big-game hunting, it is becoming apparent that rock art in Lake County primarily occurs in association with occupation sites, both in lowland lake basins and in upland regions. Ricks and Cannon also are compiling a computer- ized petroglyph bibliography for the western United States. To date, over 2,000 articles and books have been entered into the data base by author, title, and key word. NEVADA. P. J. Wilke (University of California, Riverside [UCR]) completed fieldwork at a historical- period pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) wingtrap at Whisky Flat, Mineral County. The trap, observed in the last century by Edward Kern, consisted of two cor- rals and converging wings. It was strategically placed to take advantage of topographic features. The trap utilized juniper posts, and it is thought that a net was used to close the trap after the animals entered. Blinds or shooting stations are within the main corral. Screen- ing of backdirt from nearby vandalized aboriginal houses produced a late prehistoric/historic assemblage that included pronghorn bones and numerous small arrowpoints. A generally similar structure, built high in the Ex- celsior Mountains about 2 km from the first trap, is believed to have been a deer trap. This interpretation is based on likely prey species in that environment. A late prehistoric or historic context is indicated by por- tions of the corral utilizing living juniper trees. Wilke also investigated numerous living juniper trees. These trees retain scars from removal of bow staves having a median length of 113 cm. Up to 16 staves were removed from a single tree. These sites may reveal application of resource management for bow produc- tion by the historic Northern Paiute. Robert E. Parr (UCR) is studying a pronghorn trap complex at an altitude of 2,073 m in a remote area of 426 [Vol. 54, No. 2, 1989]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH the Huntoon Mountains, Toiyabe National Forest, in southern Mineral County. The trap and 10 nearby sites were surveyed, mapped, systematically collected, and excavated. A late prehistoric trap consists of a 6.8-ha corral and a drive wing over 2.4 km in length. The feature is constructed of juniper posts and basalt boulders. A second, less-well-defined, and presumably older, corral of fire-spalled basalt is contained within the late corral. Single-component sites in the immediate vicinity of the trap contain walled rock rings, hunting blinds, cairns, and lithic scatters. Surface collections, plus excavations at eight of the sites, produced over 400 diagnostic pro- jectile points. Point types are of the desert series, Rose Spring, Eastgate, Elko, and Humboldt types. Other ar- tifacts include drills, perforators, burins, scrapers, bi- faces, pumice abraders, Olivella beads, ground-stone tools, and brownware pottery. The faunal assemblage principally contains pronghorn (A. americana). The trap and associated sites apparently were used for large- game procurement over a long time span. Betsy L. Tipps (P-III Associates) tested a large Ar- chaic to Protohistoric site and excavated a small Nu- mic camp in the Humboldt River drainage north of Carlin, in Eureka County, for Barrick-Goldstrike Mines, Inc. Research focused on chronology, economy, land- use patterns, technology, and resource procurement. Emphasis was placed on the study of site structure and refuse-disposal patterns and size sorting-as under- stood from the ethnoarchaeological record-to recon- struct past behavior. Projectile points from the multicomponent Archaic site (26Eu1320) indicate occupation between 3000 B.C. and A.D. 1700; a cobble feature was dated to 1320 + 80 B.P. (Beta 23901). The site served as a temporary camp and residential base close to the water and ri- parian resources of nearby Rodeo Creek. The Numic site (26Eul 319) yielded Desert Side-notched and Cot- tonwood Triangular points; a small unlined hearth gave a radiocarbon date of 590 ? 50 B.P. (Beta 23900). This 5- x-6-m Protohistoric site apparently functioned as a short-term, temporary camp where a small hunting party maintained itself while away from the residential base. Biface manufacture and repair were emphasized, and processing activities also were undertaken. There was no evidence of secondary refuse disposal from this short-term site, although refuse-producing activities may have been directed away from the hearth. With few exceptions, chert was obtained from the Tosawihi Quarry, located about 25 km northwest of the site, demonstrating mobility during the early Protohistoric era, the existence of a trade network, or both. CALIFORNIA. Brian D. Dillion (University of California, Los Angeles) has been conducting CRM work on the Malibu Coast and in the Santa Monica Mountains, Los Angeles County. He recently investi- gated two coastal shell middens dated to the Late Pre- historic period on the basis of projectile point and bead types recovered, and two Early Millingstone Horizon sites in Topanga Canyon, with numerous manos and metates, large, early projectile point types, a fish ver- tebra cogstone fragment, and abundant crude core-cob- ble tools. This research supports interpretations of a large and semisedentary population on the Malibu coast during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods, pri- marily subsisting on marine resources. This population "boom" is thought to be a comparatively late devel- opment, as earlier cultures, reliant on less-abundant terrestrial resources, are presumed to have engaged in seasonal rounds of plant collecting and hunting. These investigations expand the corpus of Topanga culture sites and raise the issue that certain locations during the Early Millingstone Horizon could have experienced population expansion many thousands of years earlier than currently believed. Robert M. Yohe II (UCR) is reinvestigating the Rose Spring site (CA-Iny-372) in central Inyo County. This site played an important role in constructing a cultural chronology for the western Great Basin. The Rose Spring site is a deep, artifact rich, culturally stratified deposit that was studied during the 1950s and early 1960s. The current project was initiated to address problems in Great Basin prehistory including the cultural chronol- ogy, obsidian hydration, site function and seasonality, lithic technology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and Coso obsidian trade. Initial fieldwork began in the winter of 1987 and included three backhoe trenches and several excavation units. Radiocarbon samples and a large number of artifacts were contained in 2.5 m of deposits. Excavations will continue through the fall of 1988 and the analysis of materials will continue over the next two years. Brooke S. Arkush (UCR) completed archaeological investigations of an extensive Northern Paiute fall/ winter encampment (CA-Mno-2122) east of Mono Lake. Research was supported by the BLM and the Regents of the University of California. Based on data from 31 activity areas, 28 isolated artifacts, three pre- historic pronghorn (A. americana) drive traps, and one historic mustang corral, four distinct periods of ab- original utilization were determined. These are as fol- lows: Early and/or Middle Archaic (ca. 5000 B.C.-A.D. 500), Late Archaic (ca. A.D. 500-1800), Protohistoric (ca. A.D. 1800-1852), and Historic (A.D. 1852-1920). The major span of occupation at the site postdates A.D. 1300, and it is attributed to the Mono Basin Paiute, a Numic-speaking group that historically ranged throughout the greater Mono Basin of the eastern Sierra Nevada region. The east side of Mono Lake was a popular area for semipermanent fall/winter camps. This primarily was due to relatively mild winter conditions, extensive pinyon groves in the nearby Cowtrack Moun- tains, and, as this study has shown, the presence of pronghorn herds that could be exploited via communal hunts. Major objectives of the study are to assess the archaeological resources at the site and to document the ways in which the Mono Basin Paiute economy was transformed from a self-sufficient, aboriginally based system to one heavily reliant on Euroamerican material goods, foods, and employment. The Indian Hill Rockshelter (CA-SDi-2537) is the focus of research being conducted in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, San Diego County, by Meg Mc- Donald (UCR). This site was first excavated by W. J. and E. Wallace in the late 1950s. They noted that the shelter contained evidence of two distinct occupational 427</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY periods separated by a hiatus. The lower deposits are characterized by Elko series dart points and a lack of ceramics, while ceramics and small arrowpoints are abundant in the upper levels. More recent excavations by Wilke (1984-1985) and McDonald (1986-1987) support Wallace's conclusions and provide additional information regarding prehistoric lifeways. Shell beads from the shelter are made from both Pacific Coast and Gulf of California species. Obsidian arrowpoints and debitage almost exclusively came from the Obsidian Buttes source, which was inundated dur- ing high stands of Lake Cahuilla. Dart points were made from tough tool stones such as basalt and quartz. The most notable discovery was the presence of sub- surface features interpreted as stone-lined storage cists. These were found below the ceramic-bearing levels, included manos and metates among the construction materials, and often were chinked with smaller rocks. None of these cists contained cached items. Agave quids (Agave deserti) and acorn hulls and caps (Quercus spp.) were among the perishables recovered from dry deposits in the rear of the shelter, and fresh- water fish remains, presumably from Lake Cahuilla, were among the faunal materials. Pollen analysis and flotation analysis of soil samples from the last exca- vation are in progress. They may provide more con- clusive evidence of prehistoric subsistence patterns. Eugene M. Hattori PLOUGH, SWORD, AND BOOK The Structure of Human History Ernest Gellner Eminent historian and anthropologist Gellner advances a com- prehensive philosophy of history from the Neolithic age to the present. "Gellner has produced a sharp challenge to his colleagues and a thrilling book for the nonspecialist. Deductive history on this scale cannot be proved right or wrong, but this is Gellner writing, incisive, iconoclastic, witty. and expert."-Adam Kuper, New' Statesman :1Ci Cloth $24.95 288 pages CURRENT PALEOETHNOBOTANY Analytical Methods and Cultural Interpretations of Archaeological Plant Remains Edited by Christine A.
