W. 3 INTRODUCTION Until recently the carbonyl chromophore has been of prime importance in the appli- cation of optical rotatory dispersion (o.r.d.) and circular dichroism (c.d.) to organic structural problems (Djerassi I960; Crabbe I965). The reasons were, first, the accessibility of the n -&gt; n* band of the carbonyl group at 290 nm to the first com- mercial spectropolarimeters; secondly, the availability of many carbonyl com- pounds of known stereochemistry, on which Djerassi and subsequently others worked so intensively; and, thirdly, a few years later the development of the octant rule as a theoretical background to the extensive collection of experimental data which had then been made by Djerassi (Moffitt et al. I96I). In this treatment we might say that one looks at the asymmetry of the molecule through the 'eyes' of the relevant chromophore; in less anthropomorphic terms, one considers the symmetry planes of the orbitals involved in the 290nm transition as a frame of reference. CH3 CH3 H 0= o H (and conformer) (I) (II) CH3 CH3 C=O /IICH3 - I 0 H H (and conformers) (II) (IV) It is appropriate to consider the logical order in which the octant rule was applied to carbonyl compounds of increasing flexibility. Djerassi had very wisely startedwith ketones of rigid conformation, trans-decalones (e.g. I) and their polycyclic ana- logues; the work then passed to more flexible compounds such as the cis-decalones (II), the monocyclic ketones (III) and then finally to open-chain ketones, including steroid side-chain ketones (e.g. IV); with these latter flexible compounds, the o.r.d. method is a valuable probe for conformational studies (Crabbe I965, PP. 134- 43). The c.d. treatment was applied initially by the Roussel-Uclaf group in Paris to similar series of ketones (Velluz, Legrand &amp; Grosjean I965). The study of the two chromophores (carboxyl and aromatic) discussed in this paper has been made possible by new developments in instrumentation. Our work [ 66 ]</page><page sequence="2">Carbox yl and aromatic chromophores 67 has been carried out with the Bellingham &amp; Stanley-Bendix instrument (Polar- matic '62) which is based on a design from the National Physical Laboratory (Gil- ham &amp; King I96I). This has permitted penetration to approximately 200nm in o.r.d. measurements; very recently c.d. measurements have also been made using a prototype commercial attachment with a Fresnel rhomb, based on a design by Dr R. J. King (National Physical Laboratory) and applied by Mr J. P. Jennings in our laboratory (N.R.D.C. Patent). Our work has included no studies on temperature effects and few on solvent differences, desirable as these are (cf. recent ketone work by Djerassi) (Wellman, Bunnenberg &amp; Djerassi I963; Moscowitz, Wellman &amp; Djerassi I963a,b). Unless indicated otherwise, all measurements are for methanol solution at about 20 0C. CARBOXYL AND RELATED GROUPS The carboxyl and related groups (such as ester, lactone, amide and peptide groups) show their first absorption maximum at about 215 nm (Closson &amp; Haug I964); we are able therefore to measure at least one extremum of the Cotton effect in our o.r.d. measurements, sometimes both. In recent measurements of circular dichroism, we can just reach the maximum corresponding to this absorption band. The Cary and Jasco o.r.d. instruments go somewhat farther into the ultra- violet. When this work on the carboxyl group was started, we soon realized that unless we could find structures of known conformation, the interpretation of results would be difficult, because the carboxyl group is subject to free rotation at the bond joining it to the rest of the molecule. Fortunately, although rigid carboxyl groups are difficult to find, rigid or 'frozen' ester groups are ready to hand in the form of lac- tones. We therefore quite simply followed Djerassi's pattern of action for the ketones, as shown in formulae V to IX. CH3 H CH3 -~~0=&lt; O H (v) (vI) CH3 1 ,CH3 0 o CH3 i R / OH (vii) (vi) (Ix) We studied first an extensive range of steroid and terpene lactones of known stereochemistry, and found that there were simple empirical rules relating the stereochemistry of a lactone and the sign of the Cotton effect (or of its first extremum at about 225 nm). For the interpretation of the results, Professor Moscowitz came to our aid with an adaptation of the ketone octant rule. The treatment discussed here arises from several conversations with him, and although some reservations 5-2</page><page sequence="3">68 W. Klyne (Discussion Meeting) may be necessary, no one has yet published any other way of treating lactones; we are therefore using as our hypothesis this sector rule derived from Professor Moscowitz's ideas (Jennings, Klyne &amp; Scopes I 964, I 965 b). SECTOR RULE We consider each of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the lactone group as having some double-bond character (X, XI). As no data seem to be available regarding the proportions of the two canonical forms in the resonance hybrid, we assume as a 0 0 ~~~~+ (X) (XI) very crude approximation that the two C-0 bonds are equivalent, and that the plane bisecting the carboxyl angle is to be regarded as a symmetry plane. Further refinements will probably show that the nodal surfaces are non-planar and that the vertical surface does not in fact bisect the carboxyl angle. However, as a first approximation this treatment enables us to rationalize the signs of the contributions made by alkyl groups and cycloalkane rings attached in various positions to the lactone group. 0 I o0 (XII) ,__ (XI) positive rotation negative rotation CD v(XtV) Each carbon-oxygen bond of the lactone group is considered in turn as a double bond, and the signs of the contributions made by substituents are allocated accord- ing to the ketone octant rule. If we look down on the lactone group from above, we</page><page sequence="4">Carboxyl and aromatic chromophores 69 then get for the upper octants the two patterns shown in formulae XII and XIII. (Since the plane of the lactone group is a true symmetry plane, the signs of the lower sectors are necessarily opposite to those of the upper sectors.) These two diagrams (XII, XIII) are then superimposed, and produce the pattern shown in formula (XIV). Here the signs of the contributions in some sectors cancel in varying degrees, while in other sectors the contributions reinforce one another, giving on balance a strong positive contribution in the back upper right sector (E), and a negative con- tribution in the back upper left sector (B). In view of the uncertainties regarding the orbital treatment of the lactone group the boundaries are provisional. Further- more, even without this proviso, atoms near a sector boundary will have a small but significant contribution. 13 7 H ! R (w) \ ~~~~~~// \/ 9/ .-~~~~~~R / 1 ~~ 11 I I (xvi) In order to apply this sector rule to a lactone two different views of the molecule must be considered. The first is the view along the bisectrix of the O-C 0 angle (XV). This is rather similar to the ordinary ketone octant projection. The seconid view of the molecule is that from above, projected on to the lactone plane. This is the new sector projection (XVI). (We cannot yet say anything about the front sectors, though presumably on the same arguments as were used in the octant rule, these are of opposite signs to the rear sectors.) It must constantly be borne in mind that to treat both carbon-oxygen bonds has having an equal degree of double- bond character is a crude approximation. Dr G. Cooper, in Professor Cookson's Department in Southampton, has suggested that it might be appropriate to swing the sectors round by about 20? in the direction of the formal C-0, since this un- doubtedly has more double bond character (Cooper I965).</page><page sequence="5">70 W.

Our method of classification which is indicated by formulae XVII to XX is based on the size of the lactone ring, the size of the ring fused to it, the position of the lactone group and the nature of the ring-junction (cis or trans). (Regarding conformation of lactones, see Mathieson I963; Cheung, Overton &amp; Sim I965). 04Z~~~1 ~ ~ 0= (XVII) (xviii) 0 _ o=&lt; b0 (XIX) (XX) Magnitude of effects Polycyclic ketones have been considered elsewhere as extended decalones (Klyne i962) and it has been shown that the magnitude of the Cotton effect is determined essentially by the stereochemistry and substitution of the carbonyl-carrying ring and the adjacent ring. We believe that the Cotton effects of lactones are similarly determined largely by the stereochemistry and substitution of the lactone ring itself and of the adjacent ring (Jennings et al. I965 b). The series of lactones is nothing like as extensive as the ketone series, but formula XXI and table 1 show the way in which the fusion</page><page sequence="6">Carboxyl and aromatic chromophores 71 of additional rings to one of the standard types (1-oxa-hexahydroindan-2-one) affects the magnitude of the Cotton effect. The basic structure consists of rings A and B. An additional third ring (C3) has a greater effect than either (Cl) or (02), presumably because (C3) is more completely in a positive sector; a fourth ring (either D1 or D2) is so remote from the chromophore that it has little effect. \~ ~~~ II/ B \ / D E Ic3 ,c 0 00 (xxi) TABLE 1.

I965a; Kjaer, Klyne, Scopes &amp; Sparrow I 964). This series has also been studied by Dirkx (Amsterdam) and by others (Dirkx &amp; Sixma I964; Gaffield I964; Craig &amp; Roy I965a). We have also measured with Professor Fredga in Uppsala an extensive series of substituted succinic acids (HO2C.CHR.CH2.CO2H) (Fredga, Jennings, Klyne, Scopes, Sj0berg &amp; Sj0berg I965). In both series there are characteristic differences between the Cotton effects of the free carboxylic acids and of their anions. We may note here also the treatment of the nitro group, which is formally analogous to the carboxylate anion, by Snatzke (I965). PEPTIDES One function derived from carboxyl which immediately suggested itself was the peptide group; Dr P. M. Scopes and Miss D. R. Sparrow in collaboration with Pro- fessor Kenner's team in Liverpool and a colleague from Professor Shemyakin's</page><page sequence="7">72 W. Klyne (Discussion Meeting) laboratory in Moscow, have studied systematically two complete diastereoisomeric series of the tri- and tetra-peptides of alanine and serine (Scopes et al. I 966; Beacham et al. I966; cf. also work on cyclic peptides, Gerlach et al. I964, I966). This work will in due course be integrated with that of other schools on polypeptides (see later papers in this discussion) (Holzwarth &amp; Doty I965; Velluz &amp; Legrand I965). ACETATES We have found that some esters in which the centres of asymmetry are in the alkyl, and not the acyl, component (e.g. steroid acetates) also give characteristic Cotton effects at about 225 nm. This must imply a greater measure of conformational preference than might have been expected. The preliminary findings fit well with an analysis of X-ray crystal structure data on acetates by Dr A. McL. Mathieson of Melbourne (Danilewicz et al. I964; Danilewicz &amp; Klyne I965; Jennings, Klyne &amp; Scopes I966, in preparation; cf. Mathieson I965). AROMATIC CHROMOPHORES This is certainly an overbold effort to simplify a very large picture, but it seems appropriate at this stage in order to complement the penetration in depth upon which theoretical workers have concentrated their attentions. This section of the paper is based on a review with Dr Pierre Crabbe of Mexico, which is in preparation. Much of this work has been done in the last three or four years, because of the improved performance of the newer o.r.d. instruments; little c.d. work has been published as yet. The importance of c.d. relative to o.r.d. will grow more rapidly here than in some other fields, because the c.d. curves are better able to 'separate' the Cotton effects of closely situated absorption bands (cf. Crabbe &amp; Klyne I967). Aromatic compounds range from overcrowded structures such as hexahelicene (Moscowitz I960, I96I), to simple compounds containing one aromatic ring at- tached to a classical 'centre of asymmetry' in a side-chain (e.g. 2-phenylbutanie or mandelic acid); all stages are available in a regular progression from one extreme to the other. For instrumental reasons the absorption band on which attention has been concentrated is the formally 'forbidden' transition at about 260 to 280num (1B2- v- Alg; or 'Lb -&lt;-'A) (Jaff6 &amp; Orchin I962; Scott I964). COUPLED OSCILLATORS The fully conjugated dissymmetric chromophores have been considered elsewhere by Mislow, Moscowitz and Djerassi (see Mislow I 962; Mislow et al. 1960, I962, I963; Bunnenberg et al. I962). Next in the scale of complexity are those compounds which contain two aromatic groups not in conjugation. Here Professor Mason has chosen a beautiful example of a fully rigid structure to treat by the coupled oscillator model in the alkaloid calycanthine (XXII) (Mason I962, I 966). The drawing (XXII A) shows the relation between the planes of the two aromatic chromophores (A, B) and the twofold axis of symmetry (C2); the planes of A and B</page><page sequence="8">Carboxyl and aromatic chromophores 73 'IB M1e (xxtI) \,z/' (XXIIA) calycanthine \ 61? xY 28 &gt;.. (XXII B) intersect in a line X Y, perpendicular to the C2 axis. XXII B is another view, showing the relation between the direction of polarization of the 310 nm transition and the intersection XY. Mason's treatment then involves the coupling of the 310nm transitions of the two chromophores.

Klyne (Discussion Meeting) We are in process of studying a number of less rigid structures, and it is hoped that many of these will fall into place in a general pattern in the future. One inter- esting example, which we hit upon by chance, is a derivative of the alkaloid coccinine obtained from Professor W. C. Wildman in Iowa. This is a methanodibenzazocine (or a bicyclo-[3, 3,1]-nonane carrying two benzene rings; XXIII), which gives some interesting conformational problems (figure 2) (Inubushi et al. I960). LIGNANS One important series of partly rigid structures is provided by the lignans of the 4-aryl-tetralin group (XXIV). Mr R. Swan in our laboratory has studied over 100 of these compounds (Swan &amp; Klyne I965).

The amplitude of this Cotton effect of long wavelength is related to the stereo- chemistry of the other centres (C 2 and C 3), and the data available suggest some useful empirical rules. Work of this type, assisted by more recent circular dichroism measurements will have obvious structural uses, and will help us to learn something of the preferred conformation of the aryl group at C 4.</page><page sequence="10">Carboxyl and aromatic chromophores 75 TABLE 2.

R. Battersby and others (Battersby et al. I965; Albonico et al. I966; Craig &amp; Roy i965b). COMPOUNDS WITH ONE AROMATIC NUCLEUS We now turn to compounds containing only one aromatic nucleus perturbed by substituents carried on the nucleus (which we will call arylic substituents) or by substituents in a side-chain, or both. It is already clear that if the side-chain is flexible the Cotton effects are generally small; thus the more rigid compounds, with the centre of asymmetry in a second ring fused to the aromatic nucleus, are probably the more profitable ones for early study. Several authors, among them Professor Moscowitz, have drawn attention to the fact that in compounds of this type, either an arylic substituent or a side-chain substituent is needed to produce a magnetic moment (,Um) in the plane of the aro- matic ring, in order to give a significant rotational strength (Moscowitz et al. I965). The distinction between the rather easily perturbed nucleus with an arylic sub- stituent, and the unsubstituted nucleus is provided by the two common aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine (XXVI, XXVII) (figure 4). Phenylalanine with nothing directly attached to the nucleus to perturb it, gives an almost negligible OCH2,HCH HO CH2CH C02H NH2 NH2 (xxvi) (XXVIl)</page><page sequence="11">76 W.

I965); tyrosine shows a moderate Cotton effect at 260 to 280nm which is presumably due to the 'mixing-in' of an n -? 7T transition involving the phenolic hydroxyl (Hooker &amp; Tanford I964). APPLICATION IN ALKALOID STEREOCHEMISTRY The following example of the use of o.r.d. in the determination of absolute stereo- chemistry is taken from our work with Professor H. Schmid of Zurich (Klyne et al. I 965, I 966). The compounds concerned are indoles (or dihydroindoles or indolenines) carrying alicyclic fragments in the molecule which appear to be of very different HNJ N I H H~~~~~~~~~~ &gt; N' H I H CO COC2H5 CH3 (xxix) (xxx) types (XXIX, XXX). The chromophores, however, are the same in both groups, and from the close similarity of the Cotton effects around 280 nm (figure 5) it seems justifiable to correlate the stereochemistry of these two groups of alkaloids, the strychnine-like series (XXIX) and the aspidospermine series. (XXX). The formulae XXIXA and XXXA (figure 5) show projections looking at the asymmetric frag- ment of the molecule from the point of view of the dihydroindole nucleus. We are not attempting to set up an octant rule here; the shapes of the appropriate segments cannot yet be defined, but this must surely be the right way to look at the asymmetric structure.</page><page sequence="12">Carboxyl and aromatic chromophores 77 +60 _ E +40 12 195X +20 S 12 (XXX A) 250 300 nm 350 400 -20 -40 (xlA D 14 -40 ~~(XXIXA) X xJ FIGURE 5.

CONCLUSION This paper has presented a panorama of compounds in a manner very different from some previous more theoretical contributions. I submit, however, that this approach is desirable to complement the theoretical studies, and to show the most profitable lines for future attacks. REFERENCES (Klyne) Albonico, S.
