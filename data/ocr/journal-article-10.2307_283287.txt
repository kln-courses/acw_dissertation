<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 37 IV.-Dionysus in the Bacchae GEORGE MAXIMILIAN ANTONY GRUBE TRINITY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Dionysus in the prologue and throughout the first part of the play, is a benevolent god, the bringer of a joyful worship. He remains so even after the palace miracle (which requires no more effects than could easily be staged), and his more terrible aspect is no more than hinted at. It is only after every effort to conciliate Pentheus has failed that he becomes the terrible and ruthless fiend of the later part. Throughout, the development in the god's character is echoed by the chorus, and it is this development that provides the key to the right understanding of the tragedy: the Dionysiac in man becoming evil and fiendish when denied and suppressed. This paper will not be concerned with Euripides the Ration- alist, or the Idealist, or whatever else he may have been, but solely and exclusively with Euripides the dramatist. My sub- ject is the dramatic structure and development of the Bacchae, and my thesis that a right understanding of it depends upon a proper appreciation of the character of Dionysus as the chief figure in the play. The supposed personal beliefs of the poet are, in the first instance at least, irrelevant to such an inquiry, and they should only be brought into the discussion if the drama contains contradictions and irrelevancies which cannot be accounted for without them. I hope to prove that this is not the case. The prologue is spoken by the god Dionysus and, as always in Euripides' best works, is highly relevant to the play as a whole. In the first three simple lines, Dionysus asserts clearly the fact of his divine birth, and then emphasises the impor- tance of it by dwelling upon it for seven lines more by means of a description of the tomb of Semele, whereon the divine flame still burns.' This emphasis is deliberate and effective, 1 It is a common piece of Euripidean, as indeed of all dramatic, technique to emphasise a particular fact or emotional motive by thus dwelling upon it, often in general terms, for a number of lines varying with its importance, and thus to impress it upon the minds of the audience. This helps to account for a great many passages commonly dismissed as irrelevant philosophising on the part o1 the poet.</page><page sequence="2">38 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 for the divine birth is the symbol of the whole drama. He then tells us very briefly of his triumphant progress through Asia (13-19). He has now come to Greece, first to his native city of Thebes, to fill it with Bacchic gladness (a'vcoXXvia). His mother's sisters, who refused to accept him, he has driven to madness and revelry upon the slopes of Cithaeron, and upon this also he dwells at some length (26-38). As for the young king Pentheus: (43-54) 2 "He opposes me in godless fight (OeoAaXE-), banishes me from his libations, and ignores me in his prayers. Therefore I shall show myself born a god, to him and all the Thebans. After putting these things right (6 O'E,AEvos a mild expression), I shall turn elsewhere, making myself manifest. But if the state of Thebes should seek in anger and by force of arms to drive the Bacchants from the hills, I shall join the Maenads and lead them in battle. For this reason I have taken on huiman form and come here in the shape of a man." 3 It is important to grasp the exact tone of this passage, which is also that of the whole prologue. It is not that of an angry god already determined on bloody revenge. There are no violent threats. He does indeed intend that his divinity shall be recognised at all costs, but he has not determined that the cost must be high. If the king yields, all will presumably be well. But if (50) Pentheus should lead his army out against the Maenads, the god himself will lead his devotees in battle. Of the terrible side of Dionysus we have thus only a hint. After which, turning to the Chorus, who must be supposed to 2 Where, as here, the exact tone of passages is important, it is unfortunately impossible to use Gilbert Murray's translation, which definitely romanticises at times and is always less matter of fact than the Greek. I am therefore com- pelled to translate as literally as possible, and can only beg indulgence for the inevitable inadequacy. 3 The words WIv oiveKa in 53 do not refer to the words immediately preceding, but repeat the same expression in 47. The god has put on human form, not to lead the unarmed women against Pentheus-for this indeed he would need his divine attributes-but in order to bring his worship to Thebes. His insist- ence on this (4,53f) is intentional. For the moment he puts aside his divine power. Gods do not persuade, they command, as Dionysus will have to do when his more goodnatured offers are rejected.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 39 enter here since to them he is only a Lydian priest, he tells them to strike up a song before the palace of Pentheus and goes off to the hills.4 In their first song, which is also their longest, the Chorus sing of the happiness of the votary initiated into the rites of Bacchus and Cybele, of the mysterious double birth of the god; they appeal to the Thebans to accept the new worship, to deck themselves with wreaths and fawnskins and to follow their women to the hills and return to the joy and ecstasy of the followers of Dionysus. This emphasis on joy and beauty has often been noted. The whole picture is impressed on our minds not only by the magnificence of the poetry but also by the length of the ode. It is in tune with the temper of the god himself in the prologue and would have been quite out of place if the more terrible aspects of his power had there been displayed. What the Thebans are here asked to accept is a glad and carefree cult, 'a sweet labour,' 'a burden of delight,' a ritual of the song and the dance (7rovov 71vV, Kaguarov r' EVKagarov, 66f; ya wraoa xopEtEL, 114 etc.). It is only when this is scorn- fully rejected that something very different will have to be endured. Teiresias now enters and calls Cadmus out of the palace to join him, as they have previously arranged, in the worship of Bacchus. Old as they are, they are in full Bacchic regalia, a ridiculous pair, and meant to be ridiculous.5 Cadmus frankly recognises the god for the honor of the family. It may be strictly true that the god has not exempted the old from his worship (206), yet we can only conclude from their silly senile antics that this conversion to Dionysiac ecstasy is, 4 The theory ot Verrall and Norwood, that the god of the prologue and the priest of the rest of the play are two different persons, is well known. (See Norwood, The Riddle of the Bacchae, Manchester Univ. Press 1908, and Verrall, The Bacchants of Euripides, Camb. Univ. Press 1910.) Apart from other diffi- culties, there is no opportunity for the substitution, for surely the Chorus are coming on the stage when the god addresses them at 55. 5 See Norwood, The Riddle of the Bacchae (Manchester Univ. Press, 1908), p. 22.</page><page sequence="4">40 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 at their age, highly unseemly.6 It should perhaps be added that the appearance on the stage of a calculating old man and an adaptable prophet does not necessarily imply an attack on the part of the poet upon the existence or the nature of the god they worship, but at most upon their type of worship. As the two old men are about to depart, Pentheus, the arch- enemy of the new religion as Dionysus himself has told us, comes on the stage. His very first words express an attitude towards the Bacchic religion from which he will not move (215 ff.): "I have come back from abroad, and I hear that some new evils have come upon the state: our women have left their homes, allegedly for Bacchic worship. They sport on the wooded hills and honour in the dance this new god Dionysus, whoever he may be. But full goblets stand among the revelling bands and one after another slinks away to service-in a man's bed. The pretext is that they are Maenads offering sacrifice, but they put Aphrodite before Bacchus." The accusations of bibulous and sexual excesses are something quite new; there was not a word about them in the choral ode, and they are moreover definitely disproved later by the herds- man's speech. It is not so much that Pentheus has been misinformed (he admittedly depends on hearsay) as that there is something in his mind which prevents him from examining the evidence on its merits, even where his own mother is con- cerned. Like Hippolytus, Pentheus is a very pure young man, but of a far more unpleasant type in that he has not the wor- ship of another goddess to redeem him. He is a puritan with a prurient mind, desperately afraid of the power of emotions let loose. True to type, he will not be able to drink without being disgustingly drunk. 6 The two greybeards are only playing safe by moving with the times. That is the meaning of (200-203): "We do not match our cleverness against the gods (oi66ci uo0LPAeoueOa roLoL baL/ooa), we hold on to the tradition of our fathers, old as time, whicn no argument shall destroy. . . . What they have inherited is not, of course, the acceptance of Dionysiac worship, since that has only just been introduced, but a general willingness to accept new gods and old without reasoning dangerously. Note that Teiresias is shortly to embark upon a piece of rationalisation which for sophistry (aoq5c--OaL) would be hard to match.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 41 Pentheus tells us that he has already imprisoned some of the women, and that he will soon deal with the Lydian stranger " with his fragrant blond tresses and the vinous graces of Aphrodite in his eyes" (note the emphasis on Aphrodite); and he unequivocally denies the divine birth of Dionysus. At this point he perceives the two old men and is ashamed of the ridiculous sight (roXviv yEXcov, 250). He accuses Teiresias of venality, and brutally tells him that if it were not for his old age, he would be confined with the women in prison. The answer of the old prophet is a brilliant piece of charac- terisation. The diction is frigid, the theology specious; he admits only such symbolism and allegory as will explain un- necessary stories like that of the double birth I but will not cast any doubts upon the existence of Dionysus, who, to him, is the god of the grape as Demeter is the goddess of solid food. He celebrates the god's powers, the inspiration that follows from 'absorbing him into the body,' and foretells his glorious future in Greece. As for chastity and promiscuousness, Di- onysus only shows up the true nature of a woman. There must have been many seers and prophets at Athens, theological sophists perhaps not unlike Euthyphro, who clung to the orthodox beliefs in the gods and who were yet intelligent enough to know that they must make some concessions to rationalism. So they explained away such very crude stories as the birth of Dionysus from the thigh of Zeus, leaving the fundamental absurdity of the whole story standing. Nor is the, to us, rather too complete identification of Dionysus with wine here out of place (284). The drinking of the god's body was always part of the Dionysiac religion, as it has been of others. The conception may be crude and illogical and may seem incompatible with the worship of Dionysus as a personal god, but it is not theologically fatal to a prophet of Teiresias' dialectical skill. 7 He explains it as arising from a confusion between the word ,urjpos, the thigh (of Zeus) and O,A77pos, the phantom hostage which Zeus gave to Hera- as if one tale were less absurd than the other (290-297).</page><page sequence="6">42 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 Cadmus then in turn appeals to the young king to recognise Dionysus on the not too honourable ground that the god is a member of the family, who will thus derive honour from him. He then reminds Pentheus of the fate of Actaeon, torn to pieces by his hounds for disrespect to Artemis. This is the first hint of Pentheus' doom, which will be more horrible still. The young man is very properly disgusted with both his elders. He sends some guards to destroy the place where Teiresias practises augury (a hubristic act), and others to seek out the Lydian stranger "who brings a new disease on women and pollutes the marriage bed "-still harping on the theme of sex. Teiresias turns away, duly commenting on the ill-omened name of Pentheus "not that I speak as a prophet, but only judging from the state of things." The denial of any pro- phetic knowledge of Pentheus' fate should not be missed, for we must believe that that fate is not yet decided. The first stanza of the next chorus calls on the goddess Sanctity to witness Pentheus' insolence to Bacchus, whom they again celebrate as the god of joy and laughter who banishes care. The second stanza expresses their distaste of excessive cleverness, and is a natural comment upon the previous scene, where there has been much play with uo4la and similar words (200, 203, 266, 267f, 312, 332) as applied to Pentheus and all that he stands for. The Chorus now echo this disapproval of their enemy.8 In the next two stanzas they celebrate Dionysus once more, in words of most exquisite poetry, as a lover of peace, a giver of wine to all alike. But at the end of the ode there is a hint of his other aspect, when they speak of his hatred for those "who care for none of these things: to live joyfully in the day and lovely night, and to keep away in their wisdom from those who are over-clever." 9 They end with a 8 See especially 397-402: "Life is short. And to seek greatness in it is to miss what is at hand. This, methinks, is the way of madmen and fools." Their praise of the quiet life is a direct reaction from the battle of wits and temper that they have just witnessed. To them Pentheus is mad. 9 Note that in 403-405 the Chorus bring out a connection between Dionysus and Aphrodite, but how different from the coarse accusations of Pentheus.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 43 return to the theme of wisdom and say that for them the beliefs of common people are enough. Dionysus is now led in as a captive, and the guard who tells Pentheus the manner of his capture insists upon the amused unconcern with which the stranger allowed it to take place: "Our prey was gentle; he did not raise his foot in flight but surrendered his hands willingly. He did not pale or change his wine-red colour, but laughed, told me to bind him and lead him away. And he stood still to make my task an easy one" (436-440). He further announces that the jailed Bacchants have miraculously escaped and, much impressed by all this, hints that Pentheus may be acting too hastily. This first meeting of the two enemies is composed in a minor key. The god is calm, restrained, almost gentle. All the excitement is on the part of the king, who considers his captive with con- temptuous curiosity and remarks on the prettiness of his appearance: "attractive to women, which was his purpose in coming to Thebes, a hunter of Aphrodite." He then ques- tions the stranger, as he takes him to be, in some detail about his country and the ritual of the religion he brings. For a few lines Pentheus is quieter and seems to be hesitating in his hostility. The god answers all his questions courteously, though he naturally refuses to disclose ritual secrets. But when the king hears that the rites take place " mostly at night " (486), this reference to the night wakes his obsession of sexual immorality, and he listens no more (489): "You must be punished for your cleverness in evil." He gives orders that the stranger's hair shall be cut, his ap- parel taken away, and he himself imprisoned. Meanwhile with quiet confidence Dionysus foretells his deliverance, declares that the god himself is present and continues to speak, as he says himself, with sane moderation,'0 while the king's anger rises beyond all reason. He orders the Lydian to be shut up 10 cav /uE / e tEZv o-wqpovwv ov oi4pooLv (504). The word o`&amp;cpwv means sane as well as moderate, and the contrast is with the king's wild and almost insane anger.</page><page sequence="8">44 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 in the stables and threatens to fight the women on the hills if they do not return. We know that if he does this he is doomed, for the god has said in the prologue that he will defend his own. It is true that before going in as a prisoner Dionysus threatens punishment from the god, but his language is still controlled, and he speaks more in sorrow than in anger. This must be so, for his anger, when it comes at last, will be invincible and unrelenting. The choral ode that follows begins by repeating the appeal to Thebes made in their first song, but the tone is more urgent and less hopeful. They no longer say: "Thebes, accept this joyful worship," but rather "Thebes, why do you deny us, why avoid us? You will have to care for Bromios in the end." It is here, incidentally, that they express again their belief in the story of Dionysus' second birth. They are naturally led to sing in the next stanza of the w rath of Pentheus who is now to them as a monster fighting against the god; and he has threatened them too with imprisonment. They then call on the god to witness this outrage and to put down the king's insolence, and conclude with an appeal to him to come in person. The appeal is, with great dramatic effect, immediately fol- lowed by a shout raised within by the voice of the god, which the Chorus here recognise as such (576-581): Dion. lo! Hear me, hear my voice, ye Bacchants, Bacchants. Chor. What is this shout, this shout of Evius that calls me? Dion. Again I speak, ye Bacchants, I. son of Semele, son of Zeus. The next few lines are of the first importance, and must be quoted in full (582-603): Chor. Ah. Ah-Master, Master.-Come to our revel band. -Bromios, Bromios. -The ground.-Oh, holy Earthquake.-Ah. Ah. -Soon the palace of Pentheus will shake in its fall. -Dionysus is within the palace. -Adore you him.-Oh, we do. -Did you see the stone entablature part asunder? -Bromios is raising his cry within. -Take the flaming thunderbolt.-Burn, burn the house of Pentheus.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 45 -Ah. Ah. Do you see the flame? Does it not glow around the tomb of Semele, where once the thunderer left the lightning flame of Zeus? Hurl your trembling bodies to the ground, ye Maenads. For the god will appear, destroying the palace. They then prostrate themselves. This is the famous 'palace- miracle.' At first reading we may get the impression that the palace lies in ruins. It is upon this impression that both Norwood and Verrall base their elaborate, and to me fantastic, interpretation of the play, for, as they point out, people go in and out of the palace in the rest of the play without appar- ently noticing that it is a heap of ashes. A careful reading of the lines, however, will show that noth- ing of the kind is supposed to have happened. Let us note first that there is no manuscript authority for attributing any of these lines to the god." They are clearly broken lines spoken by various members of the chorus, so that we cannot claim the god's authority for any of their statements. What in fact does happen? There is first a shaking of the earth, an earth-tremor, which both on the stage and in life is always called an earthquake by those who feel it. A sudden lurching movement by the Chorus would probably indicate this, but in any case earth-tremors do not as a rule leave traces, though we may if we wish suppose that the fa?ade of the palace also shakes. The next voice predicts the fall of the palace. But nothing is said to happen yet, and the future tense is impor- tant. Two further lines of invocation to Dionysus within; then a phrase that does imply something: "Did you see the entablature of the columns parting asunder? "-a strange phrase if the whole palace is seen crashing to the ground, and one that does not imply any great destruction on the stage, only a swaying movement of the fa?ade, perhaps the fall of a stone or two at most. What does take place is a great crashing within the stables at least. They call upon the god to seize the thunderbolt and burn the palace, but all that actually happens is that the living flame on Semele's tomb suddenly flares up. That is all that is said to happen so far. 11 With the possible exception of o-E,lErTE vvv at 590. which does not affect the argument.</page><page sequence="10">46 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 The palace is still standing, but by a most skilful use of a few simple stage devices and of hysteria in the Chorus, the dramatist has achieved the impression of tremendous divine power. When the Chorus have flung themselves upon the ground, Dionysus, who to the Chorus is still the Lydian priest, appears, still calm and with an ironical smile on his lips. For all that has happened the god is more amused 12 than anything else and there is not a word of revenge. To him all this is child's play and his calm and contemptuous amusement makes us realise his power far more than any anger could. He now gives them an account of what happened within, and this account too we must follow closely. He first addresses the chorus: " It seems that you perceived Bacchus shaking the palace." He seems amused that they feared for his safety, and admits, with some irony, that he saved himself. He then tells how (622-626) "at that moment Bacchus came and shook (4vErLva4E) the house and lit the flame on his mother's tomb. Pentheus, when he saw this, thinking (3oKJ^V) that his palace was on fire, rushed hither and thither, ordering his servants to bring water, and every slave was busy with the task, a vain labour (/ain7v irovc3v) "-vain because the palace was not burning at all. What the king saw was the reflected glow from the fire on the tomb. After further de- ceiving Pentheus with a phantom, Bacchus finally "wrecked the place to the ground. Everything fell together around Pentheus who thus found my imprisonment a source of woe." 13 12 That the god is more amused than angry appears from several expressions he uses: ,tO7uo-e', c's 4oEKE "you perceived. methinks" in 605; also the way he refers to their fears for him at 610-611; the description of the false fire-alarm; the delicious irony of bo6tav X4ycEy at 629; the "so I quietly walked out without a thought for Pentheus" (637); the reference. at the end of the speech, to the king's military boots. All this is very suitable for a god who has just been making light of a mortal's opposition without even ruffling his temper. 13 avvreOpaivwnat S' &amp;arav. &amp;arav is used in a vague sense and does not, be it noted, agree with the preceding SW'yara. The word 7vTIEOpavarvwTac is a a'rat Xey6t,Evov of uncertain meaning, explained by Hesychius as o-vU7rE7rTwKce, which is probably right. Verrall's translation "and it was all put together again" (the pseudo-god confesses that there was no miracle) will not commend itself to many, but it makes clear that the meaning is uncertain.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 47 This seems definite enough; and so it is. But Dionysus is now describing what happened inside the palace, or, more exactly, inside the stables where he was imprisoned. That these, and perhaps an unspecified part of the palace, were wrecked inside we may well believe. It is not necessary to suppose either that the stables were completely destroyed, or even that they were visible from the stage. What then remains of the 'palace miracle'? An earth- tremor, a flame on Semele's tomb, and the fact that the god 'brought the place down' around Pentheus. A couple of col- umns crashing down inside the stables would be quite enough, but in any case there is nothing that contradicts what can easily have been seen and heard on the stage. The rest of the miracle, for it is a real one, we are not supposed to see happening before us.14 When Pentheus comes out, he makes no reference to the disaster, and he seems to see no connection between the escape of his prisoner and what happened to him within, or, more likely, he is supposed to be too angry to think at all, too angry to take warning from Dionysus' still calm and almost con- ciliatory words (645-659). A herdsman now arrives from the hills and has a marvelous tale to tell, incidentally disproving the king's allegations of drunkenness and debauch. He narrates how they attempted to capture the Bacchanals, but only drove the women to frenzy until they turned on the herdsmen and put them to flight; how, armed with the thyrsus only, the maenads tore cattle limb from limb, and descended upon a neighbouring village, being immune it would seem from the weapons of the inhabi- tants.'5 Let the king accept the god of wine, 'for where there is no wine, there is no love, or any other joy for men.' 14 In any case Dionysus is not telling the Chorus the whole truth, since he is still hiding from them the fact that he is the god. 15 Verrall, since the tale is miraculous and he denies that there are any genu- ine miracles in Euripides, tries to discredit the messenger; he is, we are told, a low fellow, credulous and easily impressed; he cannot have seen all that he narrates and should quote his authority if he wishes to be believed. However,</page><page sequence="12">48 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 The dialogue that follows between Dionysus and Pentheus is the turning-point of the play. It begins by the king calling out the army, the fatal step, as we know (780-786). The god still makes one last offer to avoid a clash. There is nothing in the play to suggest that the offer he is about to make is not genuine. We saw in the prologue that his aim was to 'put things right' in Thebes and then pass on. Since then the Chorus have made two appeals to Thebes (105, 519), and Dionysus has, if one may apply the expression to so august a personage, kept his temper well in spite of strong provoca- tion. He does so even now, though he knows that the case is all but hopeless (802): Dion. My friend, it is still possible to put things right. Pen. How? By being the slave of my own slaves? Dion. I shall bring the women here without a battle. Pen. Ah me. This is some trick that you devise against me. It is not a trick. Pentheus will be tricked later, but then he will not suspect it. Dion. What trick? I want to save you by my skill. Pen. You have plotted this together, that you may revel for ever. Dion. I have plotted-thus much is true-with the god. Pen. Bring out my armour, and you-stop talking. It is at this point that Dionysus gives up all attempt at con- ciliation. If Pentheus is determined to fight the Maenads, there is nothing more that man can do, and he must become the ruthless god, for, whatever happens, his worship must be accepted. Dion . Ah . (ql) Do you want to see the women on the hills? The exclamation a interrupts the metre, and, as often, this is a sign of hesitation or strong emotion. The god's whole atti- tude changes at this point; the friendly giver of wine to all, the leader of joyous worship, has been rejected, and we shall miracles, even if genuine, must clearly occur off-stage, and it would be easy to discredit any messenger, for messengers are usually of humble birth. The truth is that there is nothing in this speech to indicate that it must be taken at any- thing but its face-value. The same is true of the miraculous escape of the women and the later messenger's speech.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 49 see him no more. From now on he is cruel, ruthless, and utterly unscrupulous in the method of securing his end. Pen- theus is filled with desire to see the women, himself unseen; and the god plays upon the more unsavoury side of the king's character in such a way that he finally agrees to be led to the hills in women's clothes so that he shall see without being seen. Dionysus has made up his mind. XVhat he considered as a possibility in the prologue, that Pentheus would be obdurate and lead his army against the women on Cithaeron, has be- come a reality. But instead of opposing Pentheus in war, he adopts a more-cruel and also a more tragic plan. It is over the mind of Pentheus himself that he will establish his sway; it is in the king's own soul that the power of the god will make itself felt. As Pentheus enters the palace, the god turns to the chorus for a moment before following him, and tells the chorus of his plan: that on Cithaeron the young man shall be torn to pieces by his own maddened mother and her com- panions (848): "Dionysus, now the task is thine, for thou art near." Again: "He shall learn to know Dionysus, the son of Zeus, whose nature is most dread at the last (i.e. when pro- voked, as Sandys explains it) though to men most gentle." This short speech is in a manner the prologue to the second part of the play. The god has indeed been gentle hitherto, but all in vain. He discloses his plan now, because he has only just conceived it. From now on he is completely set on vengeance. The mood of the chorus follows that of the god, but their next ode (863-911) is still restrained, as he is. They are now assured of triumph and so they rejoice, in a beautiful stanza, that they will soon again be joining in the midnight revelry of worship, like a fawn that has escaped the hunt. The refrain celebrates the victory to come (876): "What is wisdom? What more beautiful gift from the gods to mortals than to hold down one's enemies, with mighty hand pressing upon the conquered head?" This brutal sentiment is repeated after the antis- trophe that sings of the slow but sure vengeance of the gods</page><page sequence="14">50 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 over those who are mad enough to raise themselves over law and custom. They then take up again the idea of escape, which was expressed before by the image of the fawn, and celebrate the happiness of those who have found a peaceful refuge from the storm. The whole ode, singing of triumph with so much restraint, admirably fills the interval between the god's foretelling of victory and the full appearance of that victory in the next scene. The paean of triumph will come later. There is no need to dwell upon the next scene between Dionysus and Pentheus as they come out of the palace on their way to the hills, for it is clear enough. Pentheus is now completely in the god's power. He is drunk with the beastly drunkenness of a puritan on a spree; he is stupid, childish, boastful; he has lost all self-respect and self-control-all his manhood; his 'peeping-Tom' mentality comes to the surface in all its ugly deformity. As for the god, he too has under- gone a deplorable change. He now plays with his victim as a cat does with a mouse and his conduct is, as has been well said, that of a fiend.16 For that is what Dionysus becomes to a man like Pentheus. As he follows the king off the stage, he speaks dreadful words of ugly triumph. The choral ode that follows reflects the pitiless desire for vengeance just exhibited by the god. The whole first stanza is concerned with madness-that of Pentheus, that of Agave- with the refrain that justice will appear with murderous sword against the son of the earthborn (Pentheus). They then tell how he has transgressed all bonds of modesty and sense, and deprecate his overweening wisdom. Finally they call on Dionysus to appear in one of his more terrible aspects, as a bull, a serpent, a lion. If he laughs now, it is while he throws the noose round his victim's neck. The theme and tone of the Chorus are so obviously appropriate to this moment in the development of the drama that we need not dwell on it. But it is noteworthy that even at this pitch of excitement it is still 16 Norwood, The Riddle, p. 19.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 51 true, as Sandys says, that "the chorus, however spirited and enthusiastic their songs and dances may be, are never allowed to break out into the frenzy which is characteristic of the Theban Bacchanals." 17 That madness is reserved for those who have denied the god. The speech of the messenger which tells of the death of Pentheus need not detain us. If the interpretation I have put forward is correct, the miraculous details of the story are to be taken at their face value, and the suspension of disbelief will not be difficult, even for a modern spectator. The chorus then (1153) break into a paean of triumph, and they are to some extent infected with the mad joyful frenzy of Agave, as she enters bearing aloft the head of her murdered son and joins in their lyrics. Even when she quietens down enough to tell her story in iambic metre, the mad delusion is still upon her. It is only very gradually dispelled in a dia- logue with the returned Cadmus, and at last comes the realisa- tion of her horrible deed. This scene speaks for itself, and the psychological insight with which the slow process of recovery is depicted has been praised by all. The lament of Cadmus over his grandson and only heir inci- dentally shows Pentheus, whom we have only seen in a tower- ing rage, in a more human light, giving protection to the old man against all comers, and though the full kingly power had been surrendered to him, he did not, it seems, forget the man from whom it came. This whitewashing of the villain, be it only posthumously, is almost a commonplace of Euripides' dramatic technique. It was continued, if we may believe the authorities, in the lament of Agave which is now lost, and she too enlisted our sympathy, which Dionysus has forfeited, on the side of her dead son. The final scene is badly mutilated. We cannot even be sure that all that remains is genuine. Dionysus appears once more, probably in the machine, but only a fragment of his speech remains. The structure of the play, the gradual change from 17 J. E. Sandys, The Bacchae of Euripides, note on 977.</page><page sequence="16">52 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 the gentle to the terrible god, demands that he should appear here in all his terrible glory, and the extant fragments agree with this. For, after foretelling the fate in store for Cadmus, he ends with the words (1341): " Had you learned sane reason- ableness when you would not, you would be happy, having gained Zeus' offspring as an ally." The punishment inflicted on Cadmus is a puzzle to com- mentators, for after all the old man did not deny the god. But we have seen that his conversion was entirely due to -unworthy motives, and in any case it is the nature of sin to implicate innocent persons in its consequences. Euripides was the last man to depict a mere poetic justice that the facts of life forbid us to believe in. His divine forces are depicted as they are, not as they would be if they conformed to man's ethical requirements. That is why there is nothing incon- gruous even in the recriminations of Cadmus to the god (1344-51): Cad. Dionysus, we have sinned, we pray to you. Dion. Too late you learned to know me, and did not when you ought. Cad. That we understand; but you punish us too far. Dion. I suffered insults from you, though I am a god. Cad. The anger of the gods should not be like mortals'. Dion. My father Zeus ordered this long ago. By 'this' he means not the tragedy of Pentheus of course, but the nature of the gods and their anger. To argue with a god is not to deny his existence, for men do argue with their gods. The gods of Euripides, or the forces of nature or of the human soul which they represent, are quite beyond human approval or disapproval. It is not true that they must act in a manner that conforms to human morality or be denied by the poet. In so far as they are persons, they must, no doubt, accept human standards or become devils. But in the first place they may well be devils and yet exist, and in the second place no one would suggest that Euripides believed in his gods as persons in the full sense-even though to bring them on the stage he must employ the contemporary symbolism, as every poet must, and thus make them anthropomorphic.</page><page sequence="17">Vol. lxvi] Dionysus in the Bacchae 53 Genuine or not, the rest of the scene is very weak, and adds nothing whatever to the drama. There is one last difficulty: Agave sets out on her exile with the words: " I will go where Cithaeron shall not see me, nor my eyes gaze on Cithaeron; where no memory of the thyrsus dwells. For them may other Bacchants care." Much is made of this, for the queen seems to renounce Dionysus. Actually, she only says that others shall worship on Cithaeron and that the thyrsus is not for her. Indeed, how could she, with her memories, take part in the joyous revelry? In any case she certainly recognises the power of Dionysus. It is upon this recognition alone that he insists; the joy belongs to those only who follow him willingly. If my interpretation of the dramatic structure is correct, we have here a great power that functions in the lives of men, represented as a god whose worship is glad and joyful. Thus he at first appears and in this manner do his votaries describe his worship. This worship, these glad tidings, they beg Thebes to accept, this divinity men must recognise as in truth the son of Zeus. He is so real and so powerful that those who deny him are made mad-mad to the point of losing all sense of reality as does Agave, frenziedly tearing her own son limb from limb. Mad too are those clever men, those esprits forts who, like Pentheus, in the pride of their widsom that is no wisdom 18 (o v oY Luo4a), persist in their denial of some- thing far greater and more vital than they. Their path leads to utter destruction. Who is this god? Wine is his symbol, because wine wipes away those restrictions upon conduct (it is now the fashion to call them inhibitions, but they are old enough) that are not rooted in the inner instinctive self of any individual. If you would know the true character of a man, give him wine, as Plato said in the Laws."9 Thus is it true that the god of wine lays bare the emotional nature, the fundamental passions of men, Eros in its deepest and its widest sense, and in a sense 18 v.395. 19 Laws 648b.</page><page sequence="18">54 George Maximilian Antony Grube [1935 therefore Dionysus may be taken as a symbol of those passions. Recognise them as a necessary and welcome element in human life, allow them to live in you and with you; they will give you loveliness and joy. Ignore them, and they will conquer you as they did Agave, and become themselves ugly in the process. Deny them altogether, fight them, proclaim that they do not exist, and they will tear you limb from limb like Pentheus. And in that process the god has in truth become a fiend.</page></plain_text>
