<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Lectures on the Early History of the Kingshiz?. By J. G. FRAZER. NewYork: The Macmillan Co. 1905. 120, 309pp. (Price $2.75.) This work consists of a series of nine lectures originally delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the title of " The Sacred Character and Magical Functions of Kings in Early Society." " Substantially," the author adds, " they consist of a series of extracts from the forthcom- ing third edition of my book The Golden Bough, which will contain fuller information on many points." In spite of a certain lack of completeness which this statement natur- ally leads one to expect, the above work exhibits its author's character- istic, suggestive style so familiar to all students of Anthropology, and his usual breadth of information. He begins, as in The Golden Bough, by presenting the curious ethnological problem of the " king of the woods " at Nemi, to the solution of which the remainder of the material here pre- sented is made to subserve. In the second lecture he discusses the priestly and magical characteristics of the kingship in many countries, and in con- nection therewith enters upon a treatment of magic generally, which he divides into " homoeopathic magic " based on " the law of similarity," and " contagious magic " based on " the law of contact." These terms are undoubtedly suggestive, though it might be questioned whether one of them does not cast an unnecessary slur upon a certain school of medicine. Through most of the succeeding lecture this discussion is continued, but toward the end the relation of magic to the kingship is again brought forward, and the thesis that kings have evolved out of an early class of magicians presented. In lecture five material is assembled tending to show that a magician evolves not merely into a king but into a god as well. In lectures six and seven the author takes up the subject of sacred marriages, including the ceremonial marriages between inanimate objects, or between inanimate objects and human beings,-gone through in order to affect the course of nature,-and particularly the marriages of mortals with immortals. In lecture eight the popular theory of a primitive matriarchal state of society is touched upon and several ingenious suggestions intro- duced regarding early social conditions in Rome and Latium. The over- throw of kingly power in Rome Mr Frazer suggests may have been partly owing to an attempt of Tarquin the Proud to alter the law of suc- 157</page><page sequence="2">158 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 8, 1906 cession from the female to the male line. Lecture nine contains a gen- eral summary and a return to the "Iking of the woods " in an attempt to explain his character in the light of the facts adduced. More important, however, than the explanation of this one phenomenon are the general theories which accompany it, the principal of which are summed up on pages 278 to 280, as follows: "IWe have found that at an early stage of society men, ignorant of the secret processes of nature and of the narrow limits within which it is in our power to control and direct them, have commonly arrogated to themselves functions which in the present state of knowledge we should deem superhuman or divine. The illusion has been fostered and main- tained by the same causes which begot it, namely, the marvellous order and uniformity with which nature conducts her operations, the wheels of her great machine revolving with a smoothness and precision which enable the patient observer to anticipate in general the season, if not the very hour, when they will bring round the fulfillment of his hopes or the ac- complishment of his fears. The regularly recurring events of this great cycle, or rather series of cycles, soon stamp themselves even on the dull mind of the savage. He foresees them, and foreseeing them mistakes the desired recurrence for an effect of his own will, and the dreaded recur- rence for an effect of the will of his enemies. Thus the springs which set the vast machine in motion, though they lie beyond our ken, shrouded in a mystery which we can never hope to penetrate, appear to ignorant man to lie within his reach: he fancies he can touch them and so work by magic art all manner of good to himself and evil to his foes. In time the fallacy of this belief becomes apparent to him: he discovers that there are things he cannot do, pleasures which he is unable of himself to procure, pains which even the most potent magician is powerless to avoid. The unattainable good, the inevitable ill, are now ascribed by him to the action of invisible powers,whose favor is joy and life, whose anger is misery and death. Thus magic tends to be replaced by religion, and the sorcerer by the priest. At this stage of thought the ultimate causes of things are conceived to be personal beings many in number and often discordant in character, who partake of the nature and even of the frailty of man, though their might is greater than his, and their life far exceeds the span of his ephemeral existence. Their sharply marked in- dividualities, their clear-cut outlines have not yet begun, under the power- ful solvent of philosophy, to melt and coalesce into that single unknown substratum of phenomena, which, according to the qualities with which our imagination invests it, goes by one or other of the high-sounding</page><page sequence="3">BO OK RE VIE WS I 59 names which the wit of man has devised to hide his ignorance. Accord- ingly, so long as men look on their gods as beings akin to themselves and not raised to an unapproachable height above them, they believe it to be possible for those of their number who surpass their fellows to attain to divine rank after death, or even in life. Incarnate human deities of this latter sort may be said to halt midway between the age of magic and the age of religion. If they bear the names and display the pomp of deities, the powers which they are supposed to wield are commonly those of their predecessor, the magician. Like him, they are expected to guard their people against hostile enchantments, to heal them in sickness, to bless them with offspring, and to provide them with an abundant supply of food by regulating the weather and performing the other ceremonies which are deemed necessary to insure the fertility of the earth and the multiplication of animals. Men who are credited with powers so lofty and far-reaching naturally hold the highest place in the land, and while the rift between spiritual and temporal spheres has not yet deepened too far, they are su- preme in civil as well as religious matters; in a word they are kings as well as gods. Thus the divinity which hedges a king has its roots deep down in human history, and long ages pass before these are sapped by a profounder view of nature and of man." These and similar theories of religious and social evolution are not altogether new. In fact they are treasured by a certain school of eth- nologists as assured facts and as the sine qua non of anthropological in- vestigation. At the same time they are open to many very serious ob- jections. Although magic certainly does play a great part in the religion of those people which we are wont to call " primitive," the tribe has yet to be discovered in which religion consists of nothing else, and so long as that is the case Mr Frazer's statement of the evolution of religion from magic must remain the theory of a man or of a school, and subject to the vicissitudes of any other unproved hypothesis, by no means entitled to consideration as an organic part of science. Moreover, it is one thing to suppose that certain men or even bodies of men imagine that they can affect natural phenomena, but quite another to maintain that the mass of primitive men ever believed that they actually created or produced them, and it is just this imagined production on the part of the masses which the theory here advanced makes necessary. Nor does our author's hypothesis regarding the evolution of kings ap- pear to be founded on a much firmer basis. In Indian society, at all events, a sharp line must be drawn between the shaman or conjurer who acts as an individual, or perhaps as a member of a secret order, and the</page><page sequence="4">I60 AMERICAN ANTHROPOL OGIST [N. S., 8, 1906 priest whose functions are national. The former may be, and sometimes is, a chief, but his supernatural abilities are not at the basis of his secular leadership. On the contrary they are are a mere appanage or " accident " of his position, while either heredity, or wealth, bravery, sagacity, and all those virtues which bring power to individuals in civilized society are the real bases of his authority. The priestly functions, being tribal in character, lend themselves to union with civil chieftainship much more readily, but in few instances can the original functions of the priest-king be shown to have been purely ecclesiastical, and in any case it is by no means certain that the priest has evolved out of the shaman. The supposed " evolution " of society from a maternal to a paternal stage noticed incidentally has no better foundation than the two theories already considered. The fact is that some tribes are organized on a maternal basis, some on a paternal basis, while a very large number, and of these many which on other grounds would ordinarily be considered the lowest, are properly neither the one nor the other but partake of both. Nor is there the slightest reason, beyond subservience to a widespread and popular theory, for supposing that the last have altered from any other condition. It is to be feared that there has been a too great tendency among some anthropologists to segregate the phenomena presented by lower races and pick out certain elements as " primitive " for no better reason than because they do not occur or have been largely suppressed in our pres- ent so called " higher " culture. We thus assume our own culture as an infallible standard of comparison and everything outside as " primitive " in proportion as it diverges therefrom. It is much the same as if we were to assume that because the brain appears to be the seat of intelli- gence the growth of an individual had begun with the bones. For such phenomena as magic and belief in zoic or anthropomorphic beings do not show themselves successively, but are altogether contemporaneous, and if the above method of reasoning were followed, it would be possible, by a judicious selection of phenomena, to prove anything. The same may be said of the evolution of the kingship and of society in general. JOHN R. SWANTON.</page></plain_text>
