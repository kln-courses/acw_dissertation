<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. T HE neglect which has overtaken "the heir of Montaigne" in the past century makes it a little hard to realize that during the seventeenth, and even the eighteenth, century he could have been fairly classed among "the best sellers" in popular philosophy. From i6i8 to i634 his Sagesse passed through thirteen editions, and in the Bibliotheque Nationale may be found thirty-nine editions covering the period from i6oi to i672. As early as i658 there was an English translation by Sampson, and Stanhope's version went through three editions in i697, 1707, and 1729. New French editions appeared in 1762, 1782, 1783, 1789 and 1797. The secret of this popularity is to be found in the reasonable- ness and common-sense which characterize all that Charron wrote and which made his chief work, what it purposed to be, a real manual of practical wisdom. An inveterate and ungrate- ful borrower, it is not difficult to trace the contents of his book back to the ancients, to Bodin, to Du Vair and to Montaigne, but when all is done one must acknowledge that in the whole there is a unity of spirit and matter all his own. It is not the voice of any one of his authorities we hear, but that of Charron himself, giving us in the light of the revival of learning the result of his reflection upon life. An ecclesiastic and a humanist, the ideal he offers us embodies the religion of the practical man of his day. Open minded, critical, worldly in a sense, he is also religious, maintaining the combination and balance with a sanity and reasonableness which appealed strongly to the com- mon-sense free-thinkers of his own and the later age, calling out the approval of Bayle and Pope and Buckle and finding expres- sion in the judgment of Bolingbroke that he had "as much mind and more sense than Montaigne." This common judgment of his admirers, that he had more system and balance than Mon- taigne, is endorsed by his latest biographer in his conclusion that, "II crit la Somme philosophique de 1'humanisme au d~clin du 614</page><page sequence="2">THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. 6i5 Xvie siecle."' It is this putting into systematic and readily intelligible form of the fresh compromise between culture and religion made necessary by the new learning that gave Charron his vogue during the two centuries following his death. If any excuse is necessary for recalling the attention of the present to this old-time worthy, it might be found in the perennial value of the evidence that our wisdom is not of to-day nor yester- day. But a more specific reason lies in the fact of the inevitable injustice done, especially to second-rate men, by their being laid away with only a label to characterize their work; for the name applied by one age on the basis of its interests becomes mis- leading when perpetuated by another without new examination of the work itself. Charron has been labelled 'sceptic' in the past and sceptic perhaps he was; but to name him thus is to ignore aspects of his thought which have come to possess a more living interest to us to-day and which deserve equal recognition with his scepticism in any estimate of his place in the history of thought. The life of Charron does not compose very well artistically.2 There are no salient points, no crises revealing dominant moods, no strong influences on character, not even well marked stages in development. It is the life of a successful, self-contained and shrewd professional man, marked by changes from place to place but not by epochs in personal growth. It is an unexciting, middle-class narrative rather than a drama of spiritual conflict. Some have tried to make the influence of Montaigne a decisive and determining event, but there is no evidence that this, which was a real influence, disturbed the even tenor of his way or 1 J. B. Sabri6, De L'humanisme au rationalism: Pierre Charron, Paris, I9I3, P. 281. 2 The sources for the life of Charron are: (i) l'Eloge veritable ou Sommaire Discours de la vie de Pierre Charron, Parisien, vivant Docteur As droicts, par G.

XXIV. deflected him from his natural bent. Montaigne's friendship he enjoyed and his thought he absorbed, but it was all in the same quiet reflective way in which he wrote his books and made the decisions of his professional life. There are no events, no up- heavals, no stress and strain, nothing momentous, nothing to vary the pleasant monotony of a rationally directed life. Pierre Charron was one of the twenty-five children of Thibaud Charron, a bookseller of Paris. He was born in that city in I54I. Recognized by his parents as a promising child, he was given a good liberal education, and then studied law at Bourges, Orleans and Montpellier, at the last named receiving his degree in I57I. Returning to Paris he was admitted to the bar and listened with eagerness to the debates in the Pcarlement. Soon realizing, however, that without patronage his chances in law were small, he entered the church and rapidly gained recognition as a popular preacher, receiving an appointment from Marguerite of Valois and attracting the notice of the King of Navarre, at that time still a Protestant. Though much in demand in various quarters, Charron accepted in I576 an appointment as canon and ecolatre at Bordeaux, which became his home for the next eighteen years, during the course of which he formed his friend- ship with Montaigne. In I588 he exchanged his office at Bordeaux for one at Condom and went through Angers to Paris and back to Angers in the following spring. While in Paris, in fulfilment of a vow, he tried to enter the Carthusian and then the C6lestin orders, but was rejected on the ground of his years, as not having been accustomed to the rigors of the discipline. That he should have selected just these orders seems to indicate a serious moral purpose in his action, but what lay behind his attempt we do not know. The date suggests that the important political and religious disturbances of the time may have affected his usually calm spirit; for the murders of the Guises seem to have driven him into the ranks of the League for a short time in the spring of I589 and brought him into disfavor with the royalists on their return to power almost immediately thereafter. But his partisan zeal soon cooled, and he writes a letter to the Sorbonne explaining</page><page sequence="4">No. 6.] THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. 6I7 his temporary defection from the cause of established authority. Returning to Bordeaux, his experience of the evils of religious war bore fruit in his first work, Les Trois Veritez, published anonymously in I593. The book was an immediate success, calling for a second edition, which he acknowledged, in i595. It was this work which brought him to the attention of the scholarly Bishop of Cahors, Antoine d'Hebrard de Saint-Sulpice, who induced him to come to Cahors in 1594. Here he remained until the approaching death of his bishop and his desire for a less active life led him to accept an appointment as canon and the'ologcl at Condom, where he settled in i6oo, buying a house over whose door he places his motto, Je ne scay.1 Here he lived with a friend and occasionally his niece in quiet contentment. "Mes plaisirs," he writes to Rochemaillet, "sont dedans ma maison, livres, devis avecq mes amys qui me viennent veoir; et pour ce j'estudie de rendre ma maison plaisante." Though maintaining a pleasant house, Charron seems not to have taken the same pains to make his sermons pleasant, for we find a deputation of citizens waiting on the bishop and complaining that they have been called unseemly names, such as ignorant and beasts. The bishop soothes them, Charron makes no apologies, evidently believing in the justice of his terms, and the people calm down. His life at Condom was productive of two series of Discours, in i6oo and i6oi, and of the Trcatit6 de ia Scagesse, i6oi. The latter provoked sharp criticism and Charron prepared a second edition for which he tried in vain to obtain the approval of either the Sorbonne or the bishops. It was only after his death and with additional alterations that his editor succeeded in getting it issued in i604. Meanwhile the Bishop of Boulogne, Claude Dormy, tried to induce him to accept the office of theologcl at Boulogne with a view to bringing him into connection with the court, but Charron was loath to leave the warmth of the Midi-"le soleil est mon dieu sensible," he writes Rochemaillet. However, partly to arrange for his book and partly to meet the bishop, he went up to Paris, where he died suddenly of apoplexy, November I6, i603. 1 He seems not to have made use of his earlier appointment at Condom in I588.</page><page sequence="5">6i 8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEW. [VOL. XXIV. Of his personality as well as of his thought, one can well say, with Bonnefon, "il est plus celebre que connu."'l It is hard to see what is behind the not unkindly, yet inscrutable, face en- graved for us by Gaultier, a face which fails to correspond with the perhaps too friendly portrait sketched by Rochemaillet in his charming life. Certainly he was no enthusiast, yet neither was he the genial indifferentist of the Essais. The weakness and folly of human nature which he saw as clearly as did Mon- taigne, provoked in him more than the smile of gentle tolerance, it roused in him a kind of cool passion for its exposure and reform. He was a preacher unmoved by his own preaching, a rational apostle of rationalism. Even in his friendships he was cautious, though he finally admitted to his intimacy his later biographer and editor, for whom he expressed some real warmth of affection. That this coolness of human feeling, however, led to any violation of social interests there is no evidence, in spite of the charges made against the integrity of his life by some of his enemies. He seems to have fulfilled his duties with punctilious care and to have given unusual satisfaction in his various charges. The incarnation of common sense, he had no extravagant desires or ambitions to lead him astray. Content to live modestly in the intellectual circles of small towns, entertained by his books and the few friends who could contribute to his life, doing his share of the business of the Church yet not spending himself overmuch for his fellows, he was the blameless exemplar of the Epicurean ideal of his own Sagesse. And it is only as this dominant practical bent of his mind is recognized that we get the key to the interpretation of his principles. As a speculative theologian his position seems in- comprehensible, but as a preacher and moralist he becomes psychologically possible. In the preface to the Sagesse he tells us that he is not seeking to form "a man for the cloister, but for the world and for the common and civic life." Comparing the value of various kinds of sciences he writes: "Parquoy tout absolument les practiques sont les meilleures, qui regardent le 1 P. Bonnefon, Montaigne et ses Amis, II, p. 2I2. 2 Sagesse, I, c. 57.</page><page sequence="6">No. 6.] THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. 6i9 bien de l'homme, apprenent i bien vivre et bien mourir."2 So, too, as we shall see, his respect for the authority of tradition and his arguments from utility all indicate the humanist seeking, in those years of the religious wars in France, to call men back from high controversy to the ways of quiet living. One can almost hear the more strident voice of Hobbes in like manner seeking peace in the civil wars of England a half century later. It is not the voice of the speculative thinker, baffled in his search for truth and thrown back upon the problems of conduct, but that of the practical man interested in the rational life and mildly sceptical, not merely of the utility, but somewhat of the validity, of the speculative quest. It is not his scepticism making him practical but his practicality making him skeptical; for it is a short step from the idea that the knowledge of things ultimate is of little value to the further position that the knowl- edge itself is probably not very certain. In reading the Sagesse for the first time the modern man is probably more impressed by its beliefs than by its doubts, but among contemporaries and successors it was the latter that attracted attention and made its author a favorite with the atheists and Libertins of the following century, fixing for him thereby his traditional place among the sceptics of the later French Renaissance. That there is essential truth in such a classification is beyond doubt, in spite of the recent brilliant interpretation of M. Sabri6, but that such a characterization needs qualification is equally true. His scepticism is superim- posed upon a dogmatism as vigorous as itself, and both find their practical conclusion in a doctrine of faith. Looking first at the scepticism, we find it suggested by two kinds of considerations: (i) those concerning the knowing process, and (2) those derived from its results. I. In his theory of knowledge, Charron, though by no means a pure sensationalist, emphasizes the function of the senses: " Toute recognoissance s'achemine en nous par les sens. Ce sont nos premiers maistres: elle se commence par eux et se resout en eux. Ils sont le commencement et la fin de tout.''l 1 Sagesse, I, C. I2.</page><page sequence="7">620 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIV. Nevertheless, if all knowledge came from the senses, those who have the better senses would be the wiser. On the contrary, the senses can perceive only the accidents and the appearances of things, but "les natures, formes, les thresors et secrets de nature, nullement." Upon the weaknesses and contradictions of the faculties Charron bases his first general argument for scepticism. The senses give varying reports, do not agree among themselves, and have no standard of reference. " Mais qui le peut dire et les accuser qu'ils faillent, puis que par eux on commence "a apprendre et cognoistre?" They rouse the passions of the soul by their false reports and are themselves in turn disturbed by the passions. The reason (entendement) has for its natural end truth, but the possession of this belongs to God alone. If a man should happen to stumble upon truth, "ce seroit par-hazard; il ne la sgauroit tenir, possedir, ny distinguer du mensonge." The means we use for the discovery of truth are " raison et experience, tous deux tres-foibles, incertains, divers, ondoyans." The strongest argu- ment for truth is common consent, but "le nombre des fols sur- passe de beaucoup celuy des sages," and the agreement is only the result of contagion and a blind following of those who began the dance. In the Trois Veritez, Charron has discussed somewhat more in detail the disabilities of reason in respect to the knowledge of God. This work, although less generally known than the Sagesse, gives us a far juster insight into his philosophical position than does the latter, which is professedly a practical manual. In the first book we have the argument against atheism with the thesis that though human reason cannot know God, it is still reasonable to believe in his existence. On the negative side it is pointed out that the knowledge of God depends upon (i) his knowability, and (2) our capacity to know. As to (i), only the finite can be known, hence God as infinite is unknowable. The proof of God refutes itself, since a known God could not be God.' As to (2) our powers, they are not sufficient to under- stand even the finite, the effects, much less the cause of all. 1 Trois Veritez, I, C. 5.</page><page sequence="8">No. 6.] THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. 62I Moreover, we know things only so far as they are related to us and can be expressed in terms of our own nature; hence our anthropomorphic representations of the divine, as Xenophanes long ago pointed out, are not to be taken as objectively adequate. It is true that God's being is involved in that of all finite beings, but just as material prima is unknowable from defect of being, so is God from excess of being: we know only media. Taking up the principal arguments for the knowledge of God, Charron shows: (i) that we cannot know him from his effects since in this way no real knowledge can be had even of natural objects; nor (2) is the method of negation adequate for it is only a preliminary step to know what God is not; and (3) even the ascription to him of all position perfections gives us no definite idea and we are thrown back upon our inadequate images and approximations. 2. The second general argument for scepticism is less syste- matic than the first, consisting as it does in a collection of contra- dictory opinions and changed beliefs and curious customs-a collection neither original nor critical. It is strongly reminiscent of Montaigne, but displays a more definite purpose than is to be found in the Essais. There is no discussion of the logical significance of this variety of human belief, but the moral is drawn that, since opinions have changed and since there have always been two sides to every question, the wise man will not close his mind but face the fact that his own apparent truth may also be part of the universal flux of ideas. This sceptical spirit finds expression in his analysis of the character of the wise man. The essential element in that char- acter is expressed by the trait which he classifies as the second of the two main "dispositions 'a la Sagesse," "la liberty d'esprit, tant en jugement qu'en volont6.'" This liberty of judgment consists in a certain openness and hospitality of soul, a readiness to receive and examine all opinions from whatever source with- out final commitment to any. It is to be an "esprit universel," a spectator of the universe, not limited by fixed law, custom and manner of life, but "a citizen of the world, like Socrates, I Sagesse, II, c. 2.</page><page sequence="9">622 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIV. and not a village, embracing in our affection the whole human race."' It is, he admits, "A peu pres et en quelque sens l'Ataraxie des Pyrrhoniens, qu'ils appellent le Souverain bien, la neutrality et indifference des Academiciens, de laquelle est germain ou procede, de rien ne s'estonner, ne rien admirer, le Souverain bien de Pythagoras, la vraye magnanimity d'Aristote."2 To attain this openness of mind we have but to consider the variety and change of opinion actually present in the world. There is no opinion which has not been doubted, no custom which has not been deemed good. To close the mind against enquiry, to regard any question as finally settled, to hold any conclusion as not open to revision, is possible only to the man who has not looked beyond his village wall. And, similarly, liberty of will involves detachment from the non-essentials of life. The wise man will not entangle himself in affairs which are not his proper concern. He will remain master of himself and his affections, remembering that his first duty is to himself. Not that he is not to take his proper place in public life, but that he is not to waste his energies in response to every call. And the best way to ensure this aloofness and tranquility of spirit is to remember the rule "de se prester a autruy et ne se donner qu'a soy."3 This freedom of mind Charron limits in two respects, in matters of social custom and in religion. It is freedom of mind, not of action, that he is urging. Charron is a strenuous conformist, a respecter of custom, a cherisher of tradition. Whatever may be the openness of a man's mind to the value of other ways of life than those of his own community and age, he is to draw a sharp line between theory and practice and refrain from attempt- ing to live by a standard of his own. It is not the part of a wise man to turn the world upside down. Nor is it the truth or worth of social habits that demands our respect: "Les loix et coustumes se maintiennent en credit, non pource qu'elles sont justes et bonnes, mais pource qu'elles sont loix et coustumes; 1 Loc. cit. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">No. 6.1 THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. 623 c'est le fondement mystique de leur authority.'" In his apprecia- tion of the significance of custom he outdoes Montaigne and, by anticipation, Pascal: "Qui l'a dict estre une autre nature, ne l'a pas assez exprim6; car elle fait plus que nature, elle combat nature."2 And, again, in matters of religion he refuses to admit a sphere for the questioning doubt. These are things too high for the human reason, mysteries which it is its highest honor to be called upon to believe. So far is this philosophic uncertainty from being a detriment to religion that it is the best preparation and ground for it. To be conscious of the weakness of human reason is to recognize the need for divine revelation. And so Charron suggests that missionary effort among the Chinese should begin by the preaching of this doctrine of probablism, believing that when once they have been convinced of the baselessness of their supposed knowledge they will welcome the offer of the certainties of Christian faith. But before considering in detail this doctrine of faith which forms the capstone of Charron's system, we must look at the dogmatic elements of his thought which are no less fundamental for him than the sceptical. Indeed, in the expression of his certainties, he is more outspoken than in the case of his doubts, and this, not from policy, but from the depth of his conviction. For, though- he had no faith in the eternal validity of the social conventions of his, or of any other age, and though he mistrusted the powers of the reason for the attainment of ultimate theoretical truth, he was too much a practical man and a preacher to doubt the fundamental principles of conduct. The sagesse which he offered to the world was not wholly a matter of suspense of judgment and balancing of probabilities-Pyrrho was not his only master. Hooker or the Cambridge Platonists might have written this passage: "Or le ressort de ceste preud' homie, c'est la loi de nature, c'est A dire I'equit6 et raison universelle, qui luist et esclaire en un chacun de nous. Il est aussi par jamais estre esteincte ny effac6e, guam nec ipsa delet iniquitas: 1 Sagesse, II, c. 8. 2 Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">624 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIV. vermis non morietur: universelle et constant par tout; est tous- jours mesme, egalle, uniforme, que les temps ny les lieux ne peuvent alterer ne desguiser; ne regoit point d'acces ne rec~s, de plus et de moins, substantial non recipit magis nec minus.' Here Charron shows himself the inheritor of that Stoic tradi- tion which formed the starting point of modern independent ethics. He adds nothing to it, but he formulates it more clearly and effectively than had before been done and, by the popularity of his writings, did much to make it the commonplace it became in the ethics and natural theology of the I7th century. Even in the i8th century, the social and religious philosophy of Rousseau, who possessed a copy of the Sagesse, shows evident signs of indebtedness to its doctrines. If it is too much to call Charron the founder of modern independent ethics (and the lack of originality in his work forbids this), we must at least recognize him as one of the earliest to give systematic expression to an ideal of life based, not upon authority, but upon reason and experience. Not only does he ignore the Church in the develop- ment of his rules, but he subordinates as well the masters of ancient thought and makes appeal to the facts of human nature as he finds them. Experience itself must show what are the principles of successful living.2 The character of the wise man as reason approves it, he sketches in purely pagan terms, essentially Stoic, but with traits from Epicurean and Platonic sources; for, like his fellows in this age, Charron was not nicely discriminative in his use of sources, whatever would point his moral he was glad to take. An optim- istic naturalism lies at the root of his doctrine, "the way to be an excellent good man is to be thoroughly possessed with the sense of one's being a man."3 "He is said to be a wise man who understands -upon all occasions how to show himself a man, by acting in perfect conformity to the fundamental and first rules of human nature."4 Acting thus involves the free expansion of one's nature, which Charron is by no means inclined to sub- I Sagesse, II, c. 3. 2 Cf.

We are ourselves our nearest con- cern; and while the common interest is to be considered, we must not forget that finally it is our own good that is in question. " Qui oublie de honnestement et sainement et gayement vivre pour en servir autruy, est mal avis6, et prend un mauvais et desnature party."' It is the echo of Montaigne's precept, "jouir loialement de son estre."2 Original sin is ignored, man is by nature good, salvation is not the acquirement of a new life, but the develop- ment and enriching of this. It is true that he adds a saving provision that the highest development is of course not attain- able without grace,' but the fervor of his conviction finds expres- sion in his naturalistic faith in the possibilities of a rationally guided human nature. Not that life is rose-colored to him, far from it, it is at best a doubtful good which we might well have refused had we had the choice and known its risks, but its material is such that out of it we can, by taking thought, form an experi- ence not unworthy of being called happy. But not only do we find Charron dogmatizing on the funda- mental principles of conduct, his Stoic tendencies show them- selves also in his natural theology, though held in check by his distrust of speculation. It is true that reason is incompetent to give us a knowledge of the nature of God but it can show grounds for belief in his existence. In the first book of the Trois Veritez he discusses briefly the traditional arguments both natural and supernatural. The external proofs call for no comment: they are the usual implications drawn from the motion, composition, purpose, grades of being and goodness, of the world. These all point beyond themselves to some perfect ground of their existence. His treatment of the internal, or moral, proofs is somewhat more significant in its indication of his point of view, showing the primacy of the-intuitional and practical factors in his thought. His first argument is from universal consent which he takes, in Stoic fashion, as indicative of natural and divine authority for the belief, and as something 1 Op. cit., II, C. 2. 2 Essais, III, c. I3. 3 Sagesse, II, C. 3.</page><page sequence="13">626 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIV. wholly different in its value from mere custom or habitual opinion.' Human nature in its essence, as a divine product, is good and contains in itself the fundamentals of truth. However broken up its rays may seem to be in passing through the media of many minds, there is yet a single lumen naturals by which the wise may be safely led. This same revealing instinct appears in the involuntary appeal to God in times of danger or disaster, "estant une inspiration purement naturelle, elle ne peut estre vaine."2 And it is signi- ficant, as Sainte-Beuve notes, though with somewhat different purpose, that Charron's first movement, when stricken with apoplexy on the street in Paris, was to throw himself upon his knees in prayer to God.3 A third proof he finds in the facts of remorse. The supernatural proofs from demons, miracles and prophecies, we need not consider, though there is no indication that Charron does not mean them to be taken seriously. But, passing now from his inherited Stoicism, we come in the conclusion of this same first book to what may rightly enough be called his philosophy of faith; and it is here that he offers us the considerations which we can feel to be he most weighty for him in deciding his attitude in religion and theology. We have here no added rational evidence nor any summing up of that which has been adduced, but a vigorous and whole-hearted plea for the right and duty to believe that which makes for the greatest expansion and satisfaction of life. "Nous disons que l'homme doit et est tenu par obligation naturelle et indispensable, de croire et tenir pour tout certain tout ce qui est en soy le meil- leur, et qu'il vaut mieux estre que n'estre pas: et aussi ce qui faict plus au bien, satisfaction et perfection de l'homme." And this subordination of theoretical to practical values he justifies, in what we might well call biological terms, as the natural and necessary instinct of all animal life, as the condition upon which life goes on. "Toutes creatures selon ceste reigle employent tout ce qu' elles ont, A leur bien, profit et avancement: car c'est I Trois Veritez, I, c. 7, p. 45. 2 Ibid. 3 Causeries, XI, p. 203.</page><page sequence="14">No. 6.1 THE FAITH PHILOSOPHY OF PIERRE CHARRON. 627 un express commandement de nature, du quel ne peut y avoir dispense ny excuse legitime. L'homme qui faict autrement, abuse de son intelligence, de son esprit, est un monstre, il se trahit et est ennemy de soy mesme."' Intelligence is thus regarded by him as a vital organ, similar to the others, whose natural purpose is the welfare of the organism and whose perfect functioning is tested by its fruits. A depressing theory is like an aching tooth, to be mended or gotten rid of as quickly as possible in the interest of pleasant living. He nowhere says that this practical value constitutes truth; but then he was not writing a logic. Over the values of the religious life Charron grows eloquent. It gives us courage to know that there is a God on the side of right: it comforts us in affliction: it doubles our joy in rejoicing: it prevents the formation and execution of evil plans. Even if there were not sound proof of this truth, which, however, is far from being the case, we ought to take pains to convince ourselves of it in order that we may "live joyously and content in this belief." And then he calls attention to the situation to which Pascal has given most dramatic expression in his famous figure of the wager. One cannot lose anything by believing in God, but may lose all by refusing to believe: "Qui nous en peut faire repentir, s'il n'y a aucune souveraine puissance au monde, 'a qu'il faille apres rendre compte, ny qui se soucie de nous? Mais au con- traire quel hasard court celuy qui mescroit, et en mescroyant quelle horrible punition a celuy qui se mescomte."2 To the objection that the acceptance of the Christian mysteries upon faith is to open the door to all sorts of error and confusion, and that the wise man lives by reason and experience, he replies by pointing out how many things we hold for certain of which we have no proof? "In all the arts, sciences and professions, theoretical, practical and mechanical, the principles and funda- mentals are received with reverence, believed and held as most certain without proof, reason or experience." The very facts 1 Trois Veritez, I, c. I2, p. 95. 2 Ibid., p. 99.</page><page sequence="15">628 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIV. of our birth, family connections and daily life are accepted with- out a shadow of hesitation quite without proof. Why should not our attitude be the same toward the facts of our religion? For Christian truth is contrary neither to nature nor to reason, for in that case "la verit6 mesmes seroit contraire 'a soy: mais outre, ou mieux encors, par dessus nature."' Finally, he offers us the authority of the sovereign as a more satisfactory means of reaching certainty than reason, sense or experience. The individual can find the repose he desires by committing himself to the one who ought to, and who can, determine his beliefs. Reason is the source of truth in science, but authority is the standard of faith. The former is in perpetual unrest and uncertainty, the latter is fixed and certain. Interpretations of the relation of Charron's scepticism to his dogmatism have tended to minimize one or the other of the two elements in the interest of consistency, but about consistency Charron is not much concerned. Recently his ablest expositor has insisted that he was not a sceptic at all, but that his doubt was only an arme de guerre against the dogmatism of the scholastic pedants of his day, the "esprits faibles et plats" against whom he declares open war.2 Their respect for authority, their a prior method, their complacent content with their own type of civiliza- tion and ignorance of any other, these all incite him to challenge them with the philosophy of Pyrrho as the best means of rousing them from their dogmatic slumbers. Only through scepticism can they be brought to forsake their partisan controversies and be made to listen to the voice of rational common sense. It is thus only the common offensive weapon of the age rather than the expression of Charron's own thought, whose real attitude is that of Montaigne as described by Villey, " une grande circon- spection dans le jugement et une extreme prudence a se defendre des prejuges."3 This estimate is true in so far as it refuses to Charron the title of sceptic. He is fundamentally a Stoic rationalist believing 1 Op. cit., II, C. I2. 2 Sabrie, op. cit., p. 296, if. 3 P. Villey, Les Sources et revolution des Essais de Montaigne, Paris, i908, t. II, p.

His Sagesse is the philosophy of enlightened common sense with its faith in the instinctive ideas of human nature. This faith is not a blind faith, unwilling to expose itself to the light of rational criticism, but is undogmatic, conscious of the possibilities of human error, and ever ready to re-examine its own foundations, though believing them actually firm. It is not against these intuitions that Charron directs his attack, but against the confused and varying prejudices of individuals and races. It is with reference to these that he demands pru- dence and circumspection, a weighing of evidence and a supense of judgment. In the expression of this demand there is no doubt that his statements exceed his beliefs and that his criticism is heightened to scepticism by the exigencies of his attack. Yet, while he is not a sceptic, it is also true that there is in Charron a profound distrust of the sufficiency of reason to answer the deepest questions of life. Our intuitions, though valid, are limited in their scope. Beyond the natural world there is the supernatural world and into the secrets of this the reason cannot enter. It is not quite accurate therefore to characterize his scepticism as only an arme de guerre, for it does involve this real distrust of speculative theology and this strict limitation of the field of reason. To do him justice, therefore, one must recognize the eclecticism dictated by his pragmatic bent. Epicurean and intellectual, kin of Montaigne in his individualism and appreciation of the worldly grace and culture of the Renaissance, he was Stoic in his faith in the fundamental instincts and beliefs of human nature. Sceptic in his recognition of the flux of opinion and the accidental element in custom and belief, as well as in his distrust of the power of the reason to attain to ultimate truth, he was Christian in his final world scheme. But, above all, he was the practical man interested in the philosophies of the past and the sciences of the present primarily as they bore on life, both in this world and the next. For this world the ordinary tests of truth were sufficient and his Epicurean-Christian type of sage justified itself by experience, but for the all inclusive truths reaching</page><page sequence="17">630 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. beyond the present into the next world he claims the test of value and the right to believe whatever makes for the furtherance of the completer life. And this right to believe he asserts con- sciously and justifies explicitly so that, although it is not the main motive of his philosophy there is reasonable ground for classing him at least among the forerunners of the religious sceptics or philosophers of faith.
