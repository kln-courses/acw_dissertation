<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHERE THE GRIZZLY WALKS. By Bill Schnei- der. (Missoula, Montana: Mountain Press Pub- lishing Company, 1977. xiv + 191 pp. Illustra- tions, maps, bibliography. $8.95.) One of the insidious threats to rare species of wildlife is loss of habitat. Protection from hunting or commercial harvest may prove worthless if a creature's minimum habitat requirements are not met. The grizzly bear once roamed over most of the western half of the United States, but a com- bination of pressures, not the least of which was unrelenting encroachment on its range, has reduced its territory in the contiguous forty-eight states to a few wilderness areas in the northern Rockies, mostly in Wyoming and Montana. For years it has been predicted that the grizzly will soon disappear south of Canada, and management of the bear and its habitat is now a very hot public issue. Bill Schneider's historical background of relations between man and the grizzly is disappointing. He relies heavily on earlier books, the entire chapter on early encounters being mostly quotations from and paraphrases of Harold McCracken's The Beast That Walks Like Man (1955). The book lacks balance; more space is devoted to an Indian legend about the bear and to a gory account of a bear-and-bull fight than is given to the natural history of the animal. In analyzing disagreements between the National Park Service and independent scientists over the condition of Yellowstone Park's grizzly population, Schneider frequently is guilty of the inaccurate and slanted reporting that he deplores in his discussion. Errors in historical fact (he states, for example, that roads were "punched through the Yellowstone wil- derness" around 1930, when the road system was essentially complete by 1905) are compounded by inadequate research (he makes no use of the ex- tremely significant annual reports on bear manage- ment published by the Park Service in 1974, 1975, and 1976). He further weakens his case with occa- sional anthropomorphic lapses, such as his reference to the grizzly who lives in a national park where "he's the dominant species and he knows it." Schneider is more effective in outlining the vari- ous threats to grizzly habitat, explaining the ani- mal's "rights" under the Endangered Species Act, and proposing a course of action to protect the bear. The bear, now classified as a threatened species, is facing pressure from many directions - from ski resort developers to geothermal energy plants. Schneider's presentation is systematic and vivid, a grim illustration of how entangled a society's priori- ties can become and how easily an uncompromising element, such as the needs of a wild animal, can suffer. And so Where the Grizzly Walks serves us twice. First, it offers a classic case of threatened wildlife habitat, how it got that way, and where it currently stands. Second, it exemplifies the careless journal- ism so characteristic of debates generated by con- flicts over wildlife protection. Admittedly, it is difficult to maintain objectivity in such an over- heated atmosphere, but Schneider's casual atten- tion to the details of his story damages his credibil- ity. His book is timely and well intended, but the cause of the grizzly bear deserves better. PAUL SCHULLERY Mr. Schullery is the new director of the Museum of American Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vermont. Prior to accepting this position, he worked for sev- eral seasons as historian-archivist of Yellowstone National Park. Soon to be published is his book of readings on Yellowstone's history; Schullery is also at work on a book about the park's bears. 166 JOURNAL OF FOREST HISTORY</page></plain_text>
