I am grateful to Anne Lauwers at the Archives of Modern Architecture, Brussels, for her kind and capable assistance with so many of the essay's illustrations. As this research took initial form as part of my dissertation, my deep gratitude extends to my teachers Martha Ward and Tom Gunning in the department of art histo ry at the University of Chicago. All translations in the text are my own, unless otherwise noted. I. Anne Van Loo, ed. Akarova: Spectacle et Avant-Garde 1920-1950 (Brussels: Archives d'Architecture Moderne, 1988). A catalogue to the inaugural exhibition of Akarova's donation of her collection of costumes and performance artifacts, this monograph culls from two years of interviews with the dancer and her contempo raries. It is a tremendous visual and textual resource to which I and this essay are hugely indebted. A photograph from 1923 Brussels, now housed in the city's Archives of Modern Architecture, shows a dancer posed in front of a cloth backdrop. The dancer is balanced on her left leg, on releve, with the right foot pulled up to a low passe. Despite her precarious posture, she stands like a living caryatid, her arms stretched wide and bent at right angles at the elbows and again at the wrists, as if to support an invisible weight. The positioning of the dancer shows a partner's understanding of the geometric imagery sewn onto the fabric screen behind her. The upright strength of her trunk and left leg augments the verticality of two white rectangles to either side of her, while her bent elbows and right knee fit her form into the architectonic frame created by an inverted L shape above and to the left of her head. The dancer's costuming?also a play of bold forms sewn on fabric?seems to take its decorative cue from the organic curves of the dancer's body. Yet the soft forms work to visually flat ten the dancer's form and connect it to the backdrop behind her, creating an abstract composition of animate geometry. The light suit carries an applied dark swirl across the midriff that visually transfers the organic curve of her waist onto the screen behind. In a Suprematist-inspired composition, the circle placed at her breast both stylizes the woman's form and highlights the abstract symbolic order to which she belongs. The photograph goes beyond documenting a dancer in costume to display a work of visual abstraction in which the dancer's organic body is fused into the objective ground of the stage, between costume and backdrop. The woman in the photo is the francophone Belgian dancer Akarova, who in post?World War I Brussels became her country's most prolific avant-garde choreographer. In developing her unique style of dance, Akarova accorded primary place to the materials, construction, and orga nization of avant-garde aesthetics. Although she was never filmed on stage in this period, the photograph gives us a glimpse of her radical performance style that was hailed by contemporary artists and critics as "music-architecture," "living geometry," and "pure plastics." The photograph documents a fragment of Akarova's production during the years of the Belgian art movement Plastique Pure and its champion, the journal 7 Arts, which ran from 1922 to 1929. Akarova, in this period, was married to the Belgian constructivist and Plastique Pure artist Marcel-Louis Baugniet. Through her connection to him and the 7 Arts circle, she created dances and costumes in close collaboration with avant-garde artists of many disciplines and became an impor tant and well-known figure in Belgian theater. Always receiving single billing, she was famous in her own time and remained committed to dance until her death at ninety-five. Nonetheless, aside from an unpublished Belgian thesis, there is only a single in-depth treatment of Akarova's production: a monograph pro duced just years before her death by the Archives of Modern Architecture in Brussels.1 This obscurity in scholarship may be linked to her working methods. She performed solely in Belgium, eventually creating her own theater spaces at home to retain autonomy from institutional influence. The result of her noncon formist method and her careful choice of collaborators, however, was a dance fully informed by the avant-garde aesthetics of her time; it is a dance that I believe embodies the aesthetic impulses of Belgium's entry into abstraction in the plastic arts. 27 art journal</page><page sequence="3">2. Writings by Michael Fried and Jonathan Crary, for instance, have been benchmarks for my inter ests and explorations in both formal analysis and perception. The scholarship that has stemmed from their important work has led me to insist on the question, What happens to a discussion of embodiment and embodied vision in abstract art, particularly when a body is both medium and beholder? 3. The art historian Juliet Koss, writing on empa thy and abstraction in the context of Germany at the turn of the last century, argues that empathy and embodied vision "unwittingly helped to set the terms for the theory and practice of visual abstraction."

This study attempts to re-create the viewing experience of Akarova s perfor mances to suggest how she could synthesize the dancing body with the space of the stage and that of the audience through her use of avant-garde stage designs and an entirely new conception of music as a structural architecture of sound. Not only did Akarova s dance expand the discourse of the Belgian avant-garde by incorporating its Plastique Pure principles into a time- and body-based medium, but, as I will argue, she offered the first abstract artists in Belgium a glimpse of an ideal applied art. My quasi-formalist study of Akarova 's dance necessitates a discussion of kinesthetics and the beholder s self-awareness, both of which I believe were acti vated by her works sensory output. Over and against art-historical writing that too often explains perception and embodiment in art in terms of cerebral or optical response?thereby avoiding precisely the body?I would argue, in fact, that a more corporeal analysis is, perhaps paradoxically, in line with the aims and viewing experience of abstract works of plastic art created in Akarova 's midst.2 The kinesthetic viewing I describe in reference to Akarova's work demonstrates that theater, embodied self-projection, and kinesthetic desire are not necessarily in opposition to pictorial abstraction, and in fact might expand our understand ing of the urges and experience of formal abstraction.3 Belgian Constructivism: La Plastique Pure The 1920s witnessed a vibrant stage revolution in Europe. While in France the heavy presence of spectacular "big ballets"?the Ballets Russes and Suedois? overshadowed its formerly dominant avant-garde theaters, across France's eastern borders, the first so-called modern dance was being forged by followers of the rhythmically centered Dalcroze and Laban schools of movement studies. In Belgium, Akarova took up the flag of the new dance to become Brussels s best known choreographer of the interwar years. Born Marguerite Acarin in 1904 in Brussels, Akarova was the daughter of an architect, and grew up immersed in a circle of her parents' literary and artist friends. A classically trained dancer and singer, she had studied Emile-Jacques Dalcroze's rhythmic, free-bodied gymnas tics to assist her vocal practice. She had also studied Rudolf Laban's writings and could compare his ideas to the legacies of the Ballets Russes and Suedois.4 She was also an intimate of with Raymond Duncan, Isadora's brother and originator of his own eponymous dance technique. Akarova's awareness of the most current trends in dance from across Europe and America can be felt in her own innova tions, but her enterprise was most profoundly shaped by the plastic-art avant garde of her home country. Despite a common language with France and a cultural exchange pre-1914, the First World War had isolated the Belgian avant-garde. Lydie Willem has argued that Belgium's postwar position and identity as "half-blood ... a Flemish country that speaks French" gave Belgium's artists a unique European status that shifted between Latin and Germanic roots.5 The strong presence of regional ideologies in Belgium meant, says Willem, that pressure to express national self sufficiency would outweigh interest in wider European trends, thereby stunting the development of modern art. Belgium in the 1910s remained under the aes thetic influence of Symbolism and German Expressionism, while the avant-garde 28 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="4">6.

The informa tion about 7 Arts that I present here is culled largely from his study. 8. Other, shorter-lived attempts by avant-garde journals to bridge the ideological divide included Marie, a "journal bimensuel pour la belle jeunesse," directed by the Belgian Dada-Surrealist writer E.-L.-T Mesens. 9. From its first issues, Pierre Bourgeois critiqued literature and cinema, his brother Victor Bourgeois wrote on architecture, Pierre-Louis Flouquet and Karel Maes were painting critics, and Georges Monier addressed music. Other artists in the 7 Arts group were the Flemish Jozef Peeters, who wrote the manifesto of Plastique Pure, and is now considered to have initiated the abstract movement in Belgium; Victor Servranckx, one of the earliest of the group to create completely abstract works; and Jean-Jacques Gailliard, a French-speaking painter, friend of Akarova, and collaborator with Pierre Bourgeois. The French born Flouquet, perhaps the most critically recog nized painter of the movement, was Baugniet's best friend, shared a studio for some time with Magritte, exhibited works at the Sturm gallery in Berlin in 1925, and was considered by Henry van de Velde to be more evocative and powerful than Picasso or Leger (see de Heusch, 110). Maes also published artworks across borders in the pages of Der Sturm and De Sty/. Baugniet, as I will elaborate, found inspiration from Russia and France, corre sponding with both Malevich and El Lissitzky through the 1920s. 10. See de Heusch, 26-28 elsewhere in Europe was moving toward abstraction. When Cubism, Futurism, and Constructivism entered the Belgian scene, Vasily Kandinsky, Frantisek Kupka, Kazimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian had already produced completely nonfigu rative works of art. With the opening of borders at wars end, Belgium, however, experienced an explosion of avant-garde activity, in both journals and exhibitions of interna tional scope.6 The new current of internationalism in postwar Brussels tipped off not only Dada and Surrealist movements there, but also encouraged Soviet and Dutch purist aesthetics and a new Construedvist concept of the artist's role in society. It would be the Belgian artist Victor Servranckx and his group of friends from 7 Arts who would first produce entirely abstract painting in Belgium. In 1920, Servranckx and at least fifteen other key members of the Belgian avant garde, including the poet Pierre Bourgeois and the painters Pierre-Louis Flouquet and Rene Magritte, attended a lecture at a Brussels gallery by the Dutch spokes man for de Stijl, Theo van Doesburg. Bourgeois would later say that it was because of this lecture, and the resultant gathering of artists, that the ideas behind 7 Arts were born, and along with it a new Belgian style called "la Plastique Pure."7 During its seven-year run, 7 Arts urged a synthesis among the arts and aimed to unite the Belgian avant-garde with like-minded movements abroad. In its first year, 7 Arts had seven hundred subscribers and an impressive weekly print run of twelve hundred.8 True to its mission, 7 Arts was a synthesized group of both Flemish and French-speaking writers, artists, and musicians working in an inherently cross-cultural, interdisciplinary atmosphere.9 It would be among these artists of the seven arts that Akarova?and her fourth art?would bring so many of their aims to life. In 1922, at an event organized by Raymond Duncan, Akarova met the 7 Arts aesthetics critic, the painter-architect-designer Marcel-Louis Baugniet; she began a close association with him and his colleagues in art, design, architecture, and theater. During her five-year marriage to Baugniet, 1923-28, the two would work out a kinesthetic idea of Plastique Pure, through collaboration on more than a dozen dance performances?a quantity that likely would have been greater had he not been ill during the majority of their years together. The term Plastique Pure appeared first in 1922 in the Flemish journal Het Overzicht out of Antwerp, used in reference to an exhibition of 7 Arts artists Karel Maes and Jozef Peeters.10 A glance at a Maes work from this time, Peinture No. 2, shows the new style to include a purity of form; geometric figures are seen in planes that abut and cross one another at vertical, horizontal, and orthogonal joints; its bold color results from the use of only unmixed primary and sec ondary hues. The following year, Peeters would draft a manifesto for Plastique Pure published in 7 Arts on October 2c, 1923, and soon after Baugniet would become 7 Arts spokesman for the principles of the Plastique Pure movement. In Baugniet's work of these early years, we see a rhythmic structuring, a use of black, white, and primary color, and a dominant use of the circle and square, providing, as does the Maes work, a view of Constructivist influence, but also of the Suprematist paintings of Malevich. Baugniet's 1923 set design for Akarova s dance Golliwog's Cakewalk includes a Malevich-like, flat, black circle placed in the "golden corner" of the backdrop's large, white plane. The decor's cross-diagonals in gray and blue complemented his gestural costuming for the dancer.

Fabrice van de Kerckhove, "Les Lettres Dansantes: Akarova and the Belgian Avant Garde," in Van Loo, 335. Kerckhove describes this exhibition as Baugniet's introduction to the Russian avant-garde, though I would argue we can see familiarity with El Lissitsky's and Malevich's Suprematist and Constructivist design in his earlier work. 12. For a listing of new theater groups and key figures involved in the 1920s and 1930s, see Kerckhove, 336. Baugniet and other Belgian designers had presented at an exhibition of decora tive arts that included work by Malevich, Lyubov Popova, and Varvara Stepanova, introducing the Belgians firsthand to the style of the Russian avant-garde.11 The weight of the Russian avant-garde is of course felt in Akarova's choice of stage name. It was Baugniet who transposed her last name Acarin into Akarova, the name to which she would answer from 1923 until the end of her life. Constructing a Dance Radical innovations in Belgian theater in the 1920s provided Akarova a stage environment in which the importance of lighting, design, space, audience experience, political content, and overall synthesis took precedence over any authority previously held by the dramatic text or conventions of theater.12 In 1925 30 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="6">^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^Hkili^^^r ^^^^^^^^^^ \</page><page sequence="7"> Akarova in Allegro Barbaro, 1929, in costume of her own design.

Flouquet, one of the directors of 7 Arts, founded the theatrical Groupe l'Assaut with his colleague Jean-Jacques Gailliard; that December, l'Assaut published a theater manifesto in 7 Arts urging avant-garde theater innovation in Belgium by the incorporation of Plastique Pure ideas into stage design.13 Akarova surely wit nessed these developments: "It was almost always the same public who attended these avant-garde artistic events .. . [and] the same audience who attended my productions."14 I am convinced that new efforts to draw an audience's attention beyond literary content to the entirety of the stage allowed Akarova's avant-garde peers to recognize the "total art" synthesis and pure plastics of her work. In the following pages, as I describe her working method and dances, I will present the way in which her dancing body could offer to her Plastique Pure col leagues a view of a living architecture. Using the very geometry the artists applied in their own work, Akarova made that geometry felt in space and time. Perhaps even more poignant, the medium of her art was a body working and, therefore, might fulfill the Plastique Pure aim for social and applied art. Without recourse to the live performance or even to contemporary record ings of Akarova dancing, my analysis of Akarova's project necessarily comes from the experience of an imagined spectator.

Ravel's Bolero, for instance, had never been performed in Brussels before Akarova's first per formance. See her interview in Van Loo, 118. from the writings and work of her contemporary artists and critics, from her self-presentation in photographs, and from her own remembrances. Akarova's biographer Yves Robert, for example, has said that her dancing purified every thing outside the music. Just as in the new Belgian theater the actors and text became secondary to atmosphere, Akarova pared down the accessories, positions, and literal meanings of traditional dance to emphasize the musical structure that exists in sound waves between the stage and audience. Akarova's movements, says Robert, were "pure gesture for a pure-plastic art," in which "dance becomes the architecture of sounds."ls In order, then, to imagine how this was possible, he also tells us that for the most part, she balanced on the body's central axis?with the limbs and gestures acting as dynamic counterpoints that never break the central line. This description of her dancing body as a kind of sturdy yet expres sive column in space is readily corroborated by the photographs. Akarova was Baugniet's primary model of dance; therefore his agreement in Essai sur la psycholo gic des formes that "dance should, above all, be music-architecture" can also guide us to imagine her dance in this way.16 In his 1925 painting La Danse, we see a cubist fracturing of space as the figure strives to support her frame; there is an echoing of multiple curved lines both concave and convex, and the diagonal run ning from lower left to upper right in effect dematerializes the body by fusing it with a light that crosses from an airy taupe to a deep solid brown. The shifting imagery seems to articulate Baugniet's experience of dance?I would argue Akarova's in particular?as an integration of the object and his experience, of sight and sound, of form and space. A costume design for Akarova's Gymnopedie, also from 1925, shows a similar visual abstraction of kinesthetic experience that articulates this idea of a stable core with gestural expression, or "music-architec ture." In the costume, as in the painting, we see the same placement of stable cir cles near curved echoing lines, and a center line that is bisected by opposing light and dark elements. The squared shoulder and neckline, moreover, emphasize the dancer's firm presence in space as if she were an architectural support or column. As a testament to her understanding of the music-architecture of dance, Akarova always began with music. This goes against the majority of established, Laban-trained dancers developing der moderne Tanz in Europe, who were keen to free dance from its dependence on music. In Germany, Mary Wigman's Expres sionist dances would aim to release an internal meaning from the subject-dancer through the object-form of her movement; in Zurich, the Dada-inspired dancer Sophie Taeuber would use humor and a body mask of heavy costuming to remove her subjecthood and emphasize the objective form of dance. Both choreogra phers sought an essential and universal art of dance. For Akarova, however, it was through the specifics of music that she found a unifying spirit between the object-body and the subject-meaning. She would select the most modern music for her guide, often seeking out new work abroad. Because her music was often not yet recorded, it became as much a working part of the dance as the move ment. Her musicians were required to arrange the new music as she developed her choreography.17 This method also meant that the relationship between the dance and its music was never a literal, gestural translation of sounds. Rather, she created choreography to the spirit of the music, as the majority of rehearsals were without live orchestra. Though she choreographed ahead of time with the struc ture of the musical score in mind, at the moment of performance she found 34 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="10"></page><page sequence="11">18.

Despite the emphasis on music, these dances could never be literal illustrations of the musical notes, as so many modern dancers feared; rather the music added a presentness and living quality to her choreography, which would be generated at each performance through the meeting of the body with the sound. "I created a material world out of music," she said.18 Reviews tell us that she in fact succeeded in creating that sense of synthesis. One performance to the music of Fritz Kreisler and Claude Debussy was seen as a "Seance fort artistique... Mme. Akarova offered the material demonstration of esthetic ideas. ... In all, the interpretations of Mme. Akarova seduce more by their intellectual, reflective side than by their musicality, properly speaking. The art of the dance here takes an absolute value to which the musical element is more or less subordinate."19 Her work was read not as an expression of the music, but as a comprehensive artistic experience. Akarova explained her choreographic process as conceptual. Thanks to her musical method, her dances were created to be mere structural frameworks with assigned landmarks, a schema for development, or a consistent movement motif. Within that framework, however, change was an important creative factor. For Akarova,"improvisation meant a living dance.20 She was continually performing the construction of her art and its presence in time and space. We must keep in mind the two most important forces driving Akarova's dance: first, the music? as space restructured by sound?and second, the choreographic skeleton or foundation for her improvisation?rather like an architectural framework for her performance. In imagining her dances, there should be a vibrating sound environment in the theater, conceived as a living architecture of music through which Akarova's body negotiated its forms. Through sound, that architecture would have stretched from the backdrop on stage to the last row of the audience, including each beholder in the fusion of body and space. References to a sense of fusion among the elements of performance appear in contemporary reviews. One performance review describes the unification of body and sound felt by the beholder: "Her whole body interprets the musical work, becomes confused with it and at certain moments even seems to dominate it until the spectator no longer hears, but sees and understands."21 It is not there fore paradoxical that she describes a wish to "express" the music, a process gen erally considered antimodern and associated with traditional ballet. Akarova's musical expression was not literal or narrative, but was an abstract link between her body and the space around her. The links between Akarova's aims for dance and those of her painter peers are therefore not so hard to find, despite the paintings' abstraction. Plastique Pure artists strove for just this kind of integration of art with environment. Abstraction, for example, gave Baugniet the ability to fuse his designs with the spaces of life?as we can see in a modern bedroom design, in which the "paint ing" creeps along the floor, bed, and walls and shows the new flexibility of his dynamic, geometric art. In the inaugural issue of 7 Arts, an unsigned essay titled simply "Peinture" stated in anthropomorphic terms that painting "should, with movement and duration, create repose. That is, impassioned repose."22 To build such dynamic repose, Akarova would also rely on geometry. She accorded much attention to the sculptural dimension of movement.

This axis line, he says, is never broken despite the bending and undulating to music, and means that her center of gravity?the geometric cylin der of her torso?is at the heart of her movements. In a photo from her 1924 dance Sicilienne, we see what Robert means by a stable center axis at her core; but I would add that the counterpoints of her limbs, her position on demi-pointe, and the slight breaks at her elbow, wrists, and knees give the illusion of a solid sky scraper that nonetheless gracefully sways and bends to the elements. The arms and legs, she said, speak to one another through the core of the body, which remains always central. Equilibrium, Akarova admitted, was a crucial natural tal ent: "I had an ability to balance like no one else."25 When that ability began to fail at the age of forty-seven, she had to scale back her dancing. Nearly every photograph of her work shows the dancer on releve, with the 37 art journal</page><page sequence="13"> Akarova in Sicilienne, 1932, in her own 1924 costume design.

Akarova instructs the dancer Michele Noiret that the gestures must show "env/e." feet just half-raised to pointe. In a 1997 filmed restaging of Akarova's choreography with the dancer Michele Noiret, one also sees this repeated use of releve. The effect of raising the body's weight onto the ball of the foot creates an utterly dynamic stasis. Perhaps this is what she meant when she said that even when she is still, she is not still. Unlike the teetering balance of a point shoe's satin box, Akarova's raised stance is placed firmly across the breadth of the bare foot. Still, releve means that the dancer's entire body must respond and be active to keep balance. It introduces the gestalt of striving against gravity that would not exist in a ground ed, flat-footed stance; in her words, the movements must show envie, that is, desire.26 Raised off the ground, the dancer is an active, tensile force negotiating the forces in space around her. To find equilibrium on releve in fact requires an agreement between her body and the forces in space. This union of the two forces bonds figure and ground and strengthens the architecture of the perfor mance space. Tony-Alain Hermant sketched Akarova in her Danse arabe. Though his drawings do not give a satisfying account of the woman dancing, they do show strikingly how her costuming created a solid, pillarlike architecture that bound her trunk to space and allowed a free movement of her limbs. The limbs then could seem to present "successive touches" that echo in dynamic asymmetry the lines of the opposite limbs and the geometry of her costume. 38 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="14"> Marcel-Louis Baugniet, woodcuts from the series Kaloprosopies, 1925, published in Kaloprosopies: Neuf bois graves de M.-L Baugniet (Brussels: Editions de la vache rose, 1925), ea. page 13x9^ in.

Akarova quoted in Albert Guislain, "Musique et danse," Le Soir, February 3^4, 1963, 6. The best example we may find of the architectural effect of Akarova's ges tures is perhaps in Baugniet's KaJoprosopies, a series of woodcuts the artist made of his wife in 1925. In these images, it is clear that Akarova's movements stretched energetically in dynamic counterbalance to one another and gave the impression of filling up the space in which she performed. By visually expanding to fit her space in these woodcuts, Baugniet shows the sense a viewer had that in her dances her movement touched, pushed, even built its surrounding space. Constructing aVision In a 1963 interview looking back on her oeuvre, Akarova would say that she attempted to express in her plastique?her form and movement?the same states of the soul that her music, costumes, and decors were expressing in their color and lines.27 Each element of her theatrical art was to augment a single, shared meaning, with the diverse elements working in mutual support. A 1926 review of Akarova's Ballet (Petite Suite) described how the costumes merged with the dance: "Geometric figures on a plain, simple tunic . . . the rigor and the accuracy with which it is applied are admirable and a fine demonstration of pure plastics. . . .

As for the colours, their intensity seemed to depend on the speed of the movement."28 It seems the forms of her costume appeared fused to her body, even alive with it. The fusion of elements within her performance space may also have been a product of the fact that it all issued from one homogeneous vision. Except for the music, Akarova conceived and produced every element of her performance. Though her costumes and decors were often designed and signed by Baugniet? and later, by other fine-art collaborators?Akarova herself was the seamstress and constructor of the final forms these designs took. In her words: "My decors are always the plastic translation of the musical language or rather, the essence of the music I was dancing. . . . Moreover, my decors have always been built, not as a whole or as a totality, but on the contrary, as the support and the container of another expression, that of the choreography and the costumed dancer. With my body, I trace lines in space, which blend with those of the decor. It must always attune itself to another form."29 Like her improvisation, many of her costumes were alterable so that she could quickly change them in the midst of perfor mance?layering, reversing, or converting her clothing to blend with a new theme in the music or a change in movement motifs.30This adaptability may have stemmed from Baugniet's beliefs on design.

In Akarova s one-woman show, however, her shifting and multilayered costumes and sets went beyond utility and in fact showed an artist in the act of creating, conceiving, and constructing her art in plain view. Constructing Perception Contributing to her decor, and often surpassing it as a unifying element of her stage, was Akarova's lighting. Influenced greatly by her long acquaintance with the innovative Flemish dramaturge Herman Teirlinck, she wanted her luminous, colorful light projections to breathe life into the spectacle, evolving in dynamic relation with the movement. We cannot sense this attention she paid to lighting from photographs of her work; yet, her self-described debt to Teirlinck can tell us quite a lot. Teirlinck felt that "the most perfectly limited space is nothing more than an emptiness, or a hole, if it is not animated by that unsettling breath of atmosphere that is light."32 Teirlinck 's experiments are well documented through his theater workshops at Henry van de Velde's Institut superieur des arts decoratifs-La Cambre. In his classes, Teirlinck taught a concept of light as a vibration that fills the stage, evolves along with the text, and has the ability to move the drama, perhaps even more than either actors or sets.33 Not surprisingly, he would link this interest in a rhythmic ambiance of light to the rhythm of music and dance. In 1929 Teirlinck asked Akarova to assist him in his demonstra tions of light at La Cambre. Photographs show that the performance took place using a shallow stage. Akarova moved under a changing series of lights, allowing Teirlinck's students to see light as a physical part of the performance, rebounding off Akarova's varying positions and changing the relations of figure to ground. Light had the ability to change the perception of the stage space; light created a paradox of a permeating "plenitude" and a unifying "film" that could alter nately bring out the moving form or fuse it to its ground.34 Antoine Seyl, who witnessed the experiment with Akarova, commented that her "patterned move ments were inscribed on this screenlike stage."35 I would argue that, as with her musical support, Akarova used light to create a layer of webbing in space; it worked to construct yet another form of architecture on stage through which her body would negotiate as it moved. Moreover, the lighting, as Seyl attests, helped to create the sense of a more permanent "inscription" of the fleeting dance, adding increased physical presence to her movements and suspending them in a perceived image for the audience. Even the architecture of Akarova s various stages bespeaks her interest to shape the perceptual experience of her audience. The stage for her performance at La Cambre, for instance, was designed to imitate Van de Velde's famous stage for the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. The Werkbund stage included a long rectangu lar floor, along either length of which were deep pits for the dancer's entry and the musical accompaniment. This design would be kept when Akarova created her own home-studio stages, the first of which was only two meters deep by six meters long. That both of her personal stages kept these proportions tells us that 41 art journal</page><page sequence="17"> Akarova in La Danse a"amour, 1929, in costume of her own design, photograph from performance at Institut superieur des arts decoratifs, La Cambre, Belgium. Archives d'Architecture Moderne, Brussels (artwork ? Archives d'Architecture Moderne; photog rapher unknown) 36. Until she had a house large enough for a home stage, Akarova performed in theaters around Brussels and in provincial towns. See Guislain, I. From 1931 to 1936, she worked from her house on rue d'Ardenne in a narrow, black tiled studio-theater. When it became too small, she envisioned a space in which to house not only her performances, but also a cultural center for many artists. She hired Jean-Jules Eggericx, a pro fessor of architecture at La Cambre, who had created the theater of the Commissariat General for the World's Fair in Brussels in 1935. Eggericx, too, was influenced by Van de Velde's 1914 Werk bund theater and built her 1937 stage at her home on avenue de I'Hippodrome with a vaulted ceiling and a trapezoidal performance hall that ended in a circular, horizonlike stage. For further discussion of Akarova's theaters, see Brygida Ochaim, "Des Theatres construits pour des danseuses," in Transpositions, 29; and Van Loo, 122. it was an ideal space for her and that her performances were designed with a very shallow area in mind.36 Created without the depth of a traditional theater, her movements would have to be more essentialized and would require the audi ence s perception of a desired extension beyond. The photos from La Cambre, for example, show a backdrop that mimics stage designs by Adolphe Appia, who used Dalcroze eurhythmies when conceiving his architectural theater spaces known as esipaces rhythmiques. In Appia's designs, the stage space is made to resound outward in arcs, invoking a universal rhythm that connects the audience to the performer. For Akarova, trained by Dalcroze in eurhythmies, the shallow length of floor could be made to expand outward by her combination of decor, light ing, and highly symbolic movement. Similarly, Baugniet and Akarova's sets?abstract in their reduction of colors and geometric essentialization of form?in effect animate the space by creating elemental forms that paradoxically teem as if living and breathing with primary, symbolic meanings.37 Lista and others have described this as a cinematographic, screenlike display of forms across space. But Akarova's combination of sensory stimuli could not have allowed a two-dimensional experience of her perfor mance; rather the space, thickened by sound, color, and light, would seem not projected, but extended and spread out as a continuation of the audience's living space. The ideal of a stage that called on an audience's physical being is supported by Van de Velde's famous plan for the stage at La Cambre.

Lista writes that "the suppression of sets" was a product of "la danse libre," creating a dance of "pure animated plastics." Lista, 224. 38. Baugniet wouldn't fully articulate his ideas on a gestalt theory of dance, for example, until he published Essai sur la psychologie des formes in 1963. Van de Velde's curtain was to open from all sides like a diaphragm or like the eye's pupil. Here is arguably the highest authority in Akarova's avant-garde the ater circle proposing a stage generated from an anthropomorphic movement that mimics the body's vision. Akarova's Dance-Architecture To help explain the choices Akarova made in her dance, I have also relied on Baugniet's writings, as the prolific spokesperson for the Plastique Pure movement. Baugniet fully credits his interest in dance in the 1920s to Akarova, and the ideas she offered him about living form continued to influence his thinking and writing for years after their split in 1928.38 Akarova and Baugniet remained close until the end of their lives. Because of this connection, even beyond the obvious material involvement of Baugniet in nearly all of her 1920s perfor mances, Akarova would have grappled intellectually in dance with the more abstract conditions and expectations that her husband and colleagues were devis ing for the plastic arts. Nearly every one of the 7 Arts plastic artists was interested in, working in, or defining the new Belgian theater, and all were promoting equality among the arts. Akarova was a synthetic poly-artist, and Baugniet said that her work was of huge importance to his peers: "[Akarova's dance] was directly involved with the cultural avant-garde of the period. ...

Baugniet, who traveled to Paris soon after the war, later said it was the abstract pioneer Kupka who introduced him to constructivist form and geometric art.40 Exhibited at the Salons d'Automne of 1921 and 1922, Baugniet's paintings were displayed in proximity to avant-garde design, Dada, and Cubist works. Before returning to Brussels, Baugniet would begin a correspondence with Malevich. Again, as in his set design for Golliwog that cites Malevich, it is hard not to read a 1923 costume and photograph of Akarova by Baugniet as showing a Malevich-like cross in reverse. In thinking about Akarova, who worked in a body based art, it is important to remember that abstraction was always an a priori goal for Baugniet. In fact, he switched his focus to textiles, sets, and interiors in large part because abstraction was approved in design long before it would be in painting.41 His 1921 and 1922 exposure to Kupka and Malevich in Paris led him to even more thoughtful experimentation in cubist abstraction and the develop ing purism in Europe.42 Akarova married Baugniet in the year following his return to Brussels and therefore was collaborating with him during his most intense and prolific inter est in abstraction?a commitment that loosened into more figurative work in the years after their divorce. The poet Robert Vivier, who published a critical biogra phy of Baugniet in 1927, wrote that the artist used abstract stylization to "cere bralize" his visual experiments 43 Perhaps Akarova's commitment to begin always with music as her foundation was her own similar effort to take her art out of the material and tie it instead to thought. After first experimenting in decoration for its nonrepresentational imagery, Baugniet would, by the early 1920s, disap prove of what he saw in the decorative as a false use of aesthetics to produce contrived emotion or nostalgia. He instead sought an art of unsentimental, pure aesthetics, and it was this search, Vivier contends, that led him to architecture? whose every form and relation is worked out by the brain, reason, and mathe matics.44 Architecture for the new Belgian avant-garde was not an autonomous medium, but rather a model of construction for all art. Pierre Bourgeois wrote in the pages of 7 Arts that pure plastics meant "a decorative painting that objectively and physically obeys the process of architectural composition."45 Bourgeois described a postwar interest in order, which stemmed from a need to combat the brutality of war with precision, discipline, and a desire to build.46 Plastique Pure would find methods of describing nonarchitectural arts like poetry and music in architectural terms to show how they might share the same high aims as the most "constructed" and ordered of arts.47 We have already seen that Baugniet described dance as "music-architecture" so that an interest in Akarova's dance among the Plastique Pure artists would be born from her dynamic ability to set architecture in motion. As I have tried to describe, Akarova created a reasoned and mathematical framework of music, which she enlivened by a mix of dynamic and equilibrated gesture, to result in an image of kinetic geometric abstraction within an architec tural frame. In his painting Statisme of 1925, Baugniet visually supports this claim by painting Akarova as the representation of such dynamic equilibrium; though her living body is apparent in the flesh-colored portions of her arm, face, breast, 44 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="20">^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^:</page><page sequence="21">48.

The dancer is shown holding up the blue block at top, and at the same time she physically shares the diagonal plane that cuts across her waist. Baugniet expresses a dance that, through order and geometry, can be equilibrated into architecture. A chapter of Baugniet s Essai sur la psychologie des formes is titled "La Forme dans la danse." For him, dance is an ideal medium through which to analyze gestalt theory relations of figure to ground and form to form, important in any art form. He writes that "dance was born of a mathematical spirit. It will be a grouping of gestures superposed onto the musical line and supported by light and color." He continues to say that the dancer is not a female body, but rather an intermediary for the measure of space and time.48 Not only does dance create form, but "it is also the union of the three arts in time and in space: music, sculpture, architecture, made perceptible by the mediation of a beautiful living body."49 We can see how Baugniet s paintings and the Kaloprosopie woodcuts depicting Akarova do not attempt to represent actual movement, as for example a Futurist repeated contour, but rather they show movement's solid inextricabil ity from the entirety of its environs. 50 Because it uses the body, dance comes closer to the avant-garde hopes for an interpenetration of sensation and thought in art. Although the Plastique Pure artists denounced Surrealism's lack of structure as overly sensory and anti aesthetic, they were not opposed to feeling and sensation. In fact, they frequently used terms linked to lyricism and emotion in their writings.51 In 7 Arts, Bourgeois would publish on the balance between emotion and intellect;52 Servranckx wrote that while Plastique Pure contained the static base of Constructivism, it had also reached a stage of "ecstatic dynamism."53 Built as it was through a musical framework and a moving body fused to geometric form, Akarova's dance seems to have demonstrated both the unsentimental emotion and dynamism of her artistic peers. The critic Roger de Laval saw that "Akarova provokes the spirit. Her dance is free of fabrication, free of myth, and self-sufficient, and attempts to create a cerebral and psychological emotion of the intellect, with no false senti mentality. Akarova dances and her movements, transformed into pure will, intel ligence, psychology, and technique, have the special beauty of pure plastics."54 The element of temporality inherent in the medium of dance can do even more to activate feeling in the spectator. An image once placed in time creates expectation and desire that can be either achieved or thwarted by harmonious visual combinations or dissonant contrasts. In practical terms, when watching a moving form in dance, we follow a sequence in time and begin to expect, even want something from it, so that the viewing cannot be passive, but must be felt. The ideal creation of art, as set forth in the Plastique Pure manifesto in 7 Arts, should consist of three parts, the "lyrical aspect or inspiration, the technical aspect or execution, [and] the social aspect or expression."55 This last quality, the lived aspect of art, forges a most palpable connection between Akarova's pure plastic dance and the interest of the Belgian avant-garde at 7 Arts. In order to imbue aesthetics with social content, Baugniet and the others would rely on the Constructivist requirement of utility in art. Baugniet's aesthetics, says his friend Vivier, "is linked to emotive expression or, in absence of that, to practical use."56 Baugniet based his designs on three priorities: rationality, strength or resistance, and practicality.57 In 1929 he wrote his manifesto "Quelques Mises au point de 46 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="22">58.

Tart contemporairi," which involved the oft-cited "le beau, c'est l'utile" ("beauty is usefulness") and "la fonction cree la forme" (function creates form).58 Baugniet's early work as a decorator, designer, printer, and advertiser shows that he had always linked aesthetics with utility and practical application, and his furniture and interior and set designs solved the dilemma of an aesthetics that was abstract, free of sentiment, but paradoxically filled with human content.59 Again, this is a particularly 7 Arts form of constructivism. Despite his use of Russian Constructivist geometry and logic, Baugniet was never convinced of a purely visual and formal artwork free of lived experience.60 It is because of this desire for a lived and experienced art form that Akarova's dance becomes the most precise representative of Baugniet's abstract ideal. In 1936 PaulValery gave his "Philosophy of the Dance" lecture, in which he described the special "inner life" of dance, a life force that "resonates" in order to communicate to spectators who will feel "possessed by the rhythms so that we ourselves are virtually dancing."61 No matter how abstracted Akarova's sets or gestures became, the dancing body will always create a kinesthetic connection between the audience and the art. From the start, Akarova's home theaters were used to house meetings for artists, which embedded her in the avant-garde of her time, but she was seen as an artist outside restrictive labels. In the world of der moderne Tanz, Laban and Wigman were proposing an autonomous art that expressed avant-garde ideals through the dance medium's own unique qualities. Akarova, on the other hand, took full advantage of collaboration. Beyond merely functioning as parallel arts, the other avant-garde arts were to her formal and structural models, so that her dance may be seen as more than participating in avant-garde efforts, but as phys ically representing them. Oskar Schlemmer of the Bauhaus might be compared in this way to Akarova?that is, as seeming to integrate the visual and structural language of avant-garde art practice into his dance performances. Yet even Schlemmer did not fully integrate the human body into his art, but instead relied on doll and machinelike costuming to activate the art-body connection. His is a more literal illustration of dance through art. Akarova, I argue, transposed the visual and perceptual tools articulated by Baugniet and the 7 Arts group onto her unmasked, breathing, and living body, and thereby translated their hope for art into a lived experience. From Embodied Art to Lived Vision My aim in this essay has been to show how Akarova could paradoxically use an art associated with the body to show the 7 Arts artists a performance of their own Plastique Pure mission of abstraction. The journal's manifesto states that "the artistic revolution and artistic order are indissolubly linked; civilization consists of dar ing and ordering. . . . Art is active expression of civilization. It involves creating an art in the present."62 Fernand Leger, an artist closely tied with the temporal arts of film and dance, would also express in 7 Arts, during its first year, that the artist must "live in the material."63 Dance is an expression of living in a body, ordered by movement; unlike painting or architecture, which endure, dance is also an art in the present tense. Describing the ideal of purity in abstract art, Baugniet wrote that dance is the most pared-down of the arts?the dancer uses no tools or instruments to 47 art journal</page><page sequence="23">64.

While Sonia Delaunay, for instance, also experimented in performance with similarly pat terned costumes and decor, her constructions instead describe surfaces, flattening the dancer to the backdrop.

Ibid., 62. work her material.641 would argue that the beauty of dance for Baugniet is a synthesis of the arts paradoxically constructed from the most simplified of medi ums. The prominent French dance critic of this period, Fernand Divoire, also expressed this sense of the simplicity and living authenticity of dance in the 1920s, writing that "poets lie too much.. . .The painter too can lie.. . .With dance, only one irreplaceable instrument, the human body; only one possibility for expression, the truth of the human body; only one possibility of rhythm, the truth of human rhythm, the rhythm of human blood pulsating, of human breath, of the human race, of human love."65 What I have proposed is that Akarova's dance presented for the Plastique Pure movement a human, living architecture. While other innovators in modern dance were unseating music from its dominance over dance, Akarova instead re-formed music in the service of dance. I have tried to show how her idea of dance is movement fused with sound?and what is sound but webbing or waves in space, an invisible network of communication extending between stage and audience. She attempts not to represent or express the sound, but to make dance that is one with it. In uniting her body with the sound, she is uniting her body to the space in which it exists. Yves Robert evocatively subtided his essay on Akarova "The Gesture as a Sign of Sound Matter" (matiere sonore). In her dance then, he found not an affective relation to music, but rather the material reality of sound in space.66 Akarova used her music as an invisible spatial architecture in which to move. In doing so she enacts Robert and Baugniet's theory that dance is "musique-architecture." Both the daughter and wife of architects, Akarova seems to have felt herself directly involved in that vocation and a part of Belgium's archi tectural history, for at the end of her life she chose to donate all her remaining costumes and sets to the Archives of Modern Architecture Museum in Brussels. While Robert and others have described Akarova as searching for the "essence" of music, her dance is truly avant-garde because her relationship to music was physical; she was guided through space as if by the music's touch. The body and sound danced together.67 Baugniet's costumes also joined the dance, mimicking Akarova's movements and the backdrop, to unite her movements with plastic form. The moving forms on her costumes and their echoes in the decor, I believe, worked to stretch her movements from the body into the space between dancer and backdrop.68 Following Bergson, Baugniet also believed in the communication of an au deld (or sublime) that dance can provide. Citing Bergson's notion of grace as a suc cession of movements, one undulating into the next like a wave, Baugniet found that the rhythmic performance of dance augments the sublime sense of grace by allowing "the spectator to better anticipate these movements as if he himself had become master of them."69 The rhythmic presentation of forms in succession is what allows the spectator to take in the content as her own, to embody it as her own vision and space. Grace?as Bergson describes it?contains within each moment the direction of the succeeding moment, so that we have a sense of the future in the present. For Baugniet, this ability to anticipate allows a dance audi ence to feel as if time has been suspended and as if the future exists in the pre sent.70 The dancer's body moreover could assert the Belgian avant-garde's aim for dynamic equilibrium, as it is always pulled by gravity, struggling to stay balanced and upright against pressures from all sides?the body's equilibrium exists in a 48 SUMMER 2009</page><page sequence="24">dynamic, living, and continually renewing state. So while dance offers the feeling that one has grasped the ephemeral, Akarova's performance went beyond this perception to concretely express equilibrium and grace. In that relationship between dancer and spectator, Baugniet wrote, "Rhythm takes hold of our spirit and adjusts it... it dominates it so well that our individuality dissolves."71 Through the reconstruction here, we can imagine how the classically trained dancer s Plastique Pure ideals led her to transform the sensuous, sensible body into synthetic, aesthetic form in symbiosis with its environment, thereby allowing the viewer a palpable display of objectivity lived and felt. Akarova, I propose, offers new terrain through which to understand the experience of abstraction in art?an experience beyond medium-specificity, toward sensation. In this case, dance was a means for bringing the absorptive and aesthetic vision of the Belgian avant-garde to life, through direct communication and bodily engage ment of its viewers.
