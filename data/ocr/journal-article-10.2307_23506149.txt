<plain_text><page sequence="1">"DOEST THOU WELL TO BE ANGRY?' A STUDY IN SELF-PITY SHELDON H. BLANK Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati /\T THE very end of the book of Jonah, God seems to be saying to his reluctant prophet: "Now then, stop com plaining. Don't go on feeling sorry for yourself." This much is clear and on the surface. But a closer look at the sentence which concludes the book reveals a further thought — the thought that Jonah's loss is as nothing compared to the loss which God has all but suffered. And this further thought, only implied in the concluding sentence of the book of Jonah, is wholly explicit in at least one other prophetic passage. As a matter of fact, from several bits of related material, a kind of pattern emerges and it seems possible, quite within the area of Old Testament religion, to speak of a theme of human self-pity matched by divine suffering. With the end of Jonah as a starting point, this study first describes, then seeks to understand this admittedly somewhat uncommon theme. Back, then, to the end of Jonah. Paraphrased, these are the words of God to the prophet: "You are terribly upset about that plant, which cost you no pains at all, which you did not cultivate, which grew overnight, and faded overnight; but what of me? Should I not be distressed concerning this teeming great city, Nineveh?" It is superficially clear that God, with these words, rebukes Jonah for his desperate anger. Jonah, he suggests, is concerned only for his personal comfort and is now experiencing an attack of self-pity — and merely because that plant, the source of his comfort, has failed him. This much is openly stated; the rest is implicit, lurking in the form of the sentence. In form, the words of God to Jonah are an argument a, 29</page><page sequence="2">30 SHELDON H. BLANK [2] minoriminori ad majus,1 the kal wahomer of rabbinic literature, and, as is often true when this type of argument occurs, the argument here is elliptical. Before the implications become entirely clear, we have to supply the missing terms. Fully stated, the argument would read: "You are terribly upset about that plant, which cost you no pains at all, which you did not cultivate, which grew overnight, and faded overnight, and should I not be distressed concerning this teeming, great city, Nineveh, which, be it noted, cost me no end of toil, which I did care for2 — and not for one night either but for many long years?" In this argument — when we supply the missing term: the toil of God — in it, then, universalism (God made and cares for Nineveh!) mingles with anthropomorphism (It was no easy task!). But perhaps the least expected new facet of the argument, when thus fully stated, is the implied similarity in mood between God and Jonah. Jonah here is not the only one subject to disappointment and distress. Naught but the quite unlooked for repentance of king and people had saved Nineveh and thus had spared God the personal hurt that goes with frustration, unavailing toil, care unrewarded. But this occurrence of the thought that God is subject to the distress of frustration, here in this verse at the end of Jonah, is not unique. It is also the whole point of that little gem of a chapter in Jeremiah, sometimes appropriately called "the confession of Baruch." Though not commonly recognized as such, this chapter, the 45th of Jeremiah, is a perfect parallel to the end of the book of Jonah. God's word to Baruch is no less a rebuke than his word to Jonah and the logic is quite the same ■— only clearer, because here wholly explicit. Paraphrasing again, we may so restate God's word to the prophet's disciple: "You, Baruch, are saying 'Alas! and Woe! God has added grief to my pain; I am worn out with my sighing and find no respite.' Well, now, consider! What I, myself, built, I am about to demolish. What I planted, 1 So T. H.

Desist." Pared of unessentials, God's loaded question to the com plaining disciple is merely this: "What is your hurt, O man, compared to mine?"3 And, here, too, the theme: It is not men only who experience the personal hurt that stems from frus tration. Thus, in a way, the "Baruch confession" is the key to the meaning of God's rebuke to Jonah. It is in these two passages that the theme is especially evident. But it may be detected elsewhere. In fact, not unexpectedly, it appears again in the book of Jeremiah, that prophet through whom the word came to Baruch. Taken as a whole, the life and meditations of the prophet Jeremiah, his confessions and the elegies, add up to one compelling illustration of the selfsame theme. Jeremiah spoke to his beloved disciple out of insights which he achieved through his own bitter experience. The prayers of Jeremiah, his so-called "confessions," record the stages by which he came to know that he, like Jonah, like Baruch, was himself giving way to self-pity. On more than one occasion — at least twice, without doubt — he caught himself up, heard, as it were, a verdict from his Judge, and God's rebukes restored his sense of value. Once he heard God say: "Running with men you get all worn out; Would you then race with horses?" (12.5). And again, in similar vein: "You may be my spokesman Only if you distinguish the worthy from the base" (15.19). This is how he knew what to say to Baruch. The painful experiences which led to his own confessions prepared him to understand his disciple's weakness, but passages 3 Martin Buber also finds this meaning in Jer. 45: "The 'great things' which the suffering man seeks for himself, the 'rest' without grief, is not even found with God Himself at the hour when He, acting in history, comes near to destroying the work of His own hands: He suffers by His doing" (The Prophetic Faith, New York, 1949, p. 167),</page><page sequence="4">3232 SHELDON H. BLANK [4] other than his confessions best express his awareness of God's hurt: the Baruch chapter already noted and a passage or two besides, passages composed in the elegiac mood. It is indeed in the whole, in the combination of confessions and elegies, that the pattern may be detected. One such elegy follows immediately upon the confession in chapter 12. In it God himself laments: "I have left my house, abandoned my inheritance, Given over to her enemies my dearly beloved" (12.7). And in passing, we note that these words of God are hardly distinguishable from the prophet's lament in an earlier chapter: "Grief overwhelms me, I am sick at heart. . . For the breach of the daughter of my people I am utterly broken, I am sunk in gloom, desolation has seized me . . . Would that my head were water and my eyes a fount of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people" (8.18, 21, 23). The similarity is striking, and it is perhaps not strange that Jeremiah, in whom the conflict raged most fiercely, was the prophet who most keenly felt God's hurt. Incidentally, again, it goes almost without saying that Jeremiah's God was not aloof. Like Jeremiah, he was most intimately involved with his people's sorrow. As David mourned for Absalom, so in another Jeremianic passage God mourns for Ephraim : "Is Ephraim a favorite son? My own dear boy? That as often as I speak of him I have to remember him again the more?4 My compassion is aroused; I yearn for him" (31.20). &lt; Compare the concept of compelling love in Gen. 31.30 and the similar use there of the infinitive absolute.</page><page sequence="5">[5] "DOEST THOU WELL TO BE ANGRY?" 33 Jeremiah fell heir to Hosea's mantle and this was among its hues. For, in the same strain God had spoken of Israel through the prophet Hosea: "How can I give thee up, O Ephraim; Deliver thee over, Israel? . . . My heart turns within me, I am deeply affected" (11.8).5 Jeremiah received the spirit from Hosea and he handed it on to the Second Isaiah. So it is no surprise to hear the same longing in the bold language of the prophet of the Exile, when, in chapter 42, that prophet expresses God's frenzied impatience at the delay in the salvation of his people : "For a long time I have held my peace, Mute, restraining myself; Now I will cry out, like a woman in travail, Panting and gasping at once" (v. 14). All three, Hosea, Jeremiah, and the Second Isaiah, were keenly aware of the hurt of God, but Jeremiah felt and articulated it the most clearly. So the theme begins to assume a pattern. A man complains, bemoans his bitter lot — as Jonah, when the plant fades; as Baruch, who can find no rest; as Jeremiah, torn between God and his people — and each one learns — Jonah, through God's rebuke ; Baruch, through Jeremiah's word; and Jeremiah, through his own sharing in God's grief — each learns that God also suffers, and this knowledge, presumably, sets him right. Three times we have found the pattern complete: a man's complaint seen in the context of God's suffering, both elements present and viewed at once. To be sure, the single elements also appear alone. Elijah, for example, had his bad moments; "I, even I only, am left, and they seek to take away my life," he said (I Kings 19.10, 14). And he sat beneath a broom tree and invited death, in that he said: s This appears to be the sense of the phrase whether we retain the MT or, more probably, read רחמי for נחומי.</page><page sequence="6">[6][6] 34 SHELDON H. BLANK "Enough now, Lord! Take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers" (I Kings 19.4). The one half of the pattern is there; Elijah plays his part. But that is all; in the ensuing theophany, God does not match with his own the prophet's complaint. And there are many Elijahs in the Bible, notably among the psalmists; many bitterly moan because of their lot but fail to learn what Jonah learned, and Baruch, and Jeremiah, that their grief is matched by God's. So, too, the other half of the pattern; it also appears alone. In passages already quoted, Hosea, before Jeremiah, and the Second Isaiah after him, gave voice to God's hurt unprompted by evidence of a man's self-pity. This second element in the pattern appears again alone in the opening words of the flood narrative as related in the earlier source: "And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth . . . and the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth, ויתעצב אל לבו, and it grieved him to his heart" (Gen. 6.5 f.). We may at first doubt the relevance of this last passage — wrongly, I think. For, here, too, God's grief stems from frustration, his plans having gone awry. He meant the earth to be populated ; he did not intend it for a waste. Deutero-Isaiah means something like this when in 45.18 he writes: לא תהו בראה לשבת יצרה, "He did not create it a waste; he formed it to be inhabited." Therefore the sense of frustration, when it must be destroyed. In all of these latter examples, the pattern is partial ; the one or the other element appears alone. The complete pattern has as yet been found only in Jonah, in "the Baruch confession," and in the combination of Jeremianic confessions and elegies. Hesitantly, next and lastly, one thinks of Job. It is possible that also in Job the pattern is complete. Now if this Titan felt pity for himself, he had sufficient cause, and a comparison with Jonah and his irritation seems somewhat disproportionate. But Job and Jeremiah are more of a size and their complaints commensurate. The differences do not conceal the basic simi larity. Even as, in the confessions, God appears to the com plaining Jeremiah to set him right about his troubles and, in elegies, grants him glimpses of troubles yet vaster, it may be</page><page sequence="7">[7] "DOEST THOU WELL TO BE ANGRY?" 35 that God appears, to rebuke the complaining righteous Job, this time in a mighty storm but with similar intent.6 With a considerable degree of plausibility, it has been argued that God appears to Job in order to call his attention to troubles which are beyond his human ken, the troubles of the lone God of all this world. Ralph Marcus is responsible for the suggestion that verses 9 to 14 in the fortieth chapter are the core of God's rebuke and that, in effect, they say: "Do my work, if you can. You will soon learn that it is no simple matter."7 And, I would be inclined to add to his suggestion, perhaps they even say: "It can be quite frustrating, as you'd very soon find out." To me the overtones of God's words in this passage do not sound ironical; they sound mildly reproachful, reflective, and challenging, in the spirit of the suggested parallels. "Have you an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like his? Deck yourself with majesty and dignity; Clothe yourself with glory and splendor. Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, And look on everyone that is proud, and abase him, . . . And tread down the wicked where they stand. Hide them all in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place. Then will I also acknowledge to you That your own right hand can give you victory." (Job 40.9-14 — RSV). 6 It is, to be sure, a mild rebuke and subtle, Job 38.4, 12. 7 "First I shall try to phrase in the simplest terms what the poet seems to report God as saying. It is that God is so much involved in trying to control the demonic forces of the universe which he has created, rules and cares for, that he has, so to speak, neither time nor inclination to look out especially for Job, let alone persecute him. Strange as it may seem in so Hebraic a book as Job, God is constrained though not defeated by Necessity, even as the Creator God of Plato is con strained by Anankë." From an article entitled "Job and God," which appeared in the Review of Religion, Nov. 1949, Vol. XIV, p. 28.</page><page sequence="8">36 SHELDON H. BLANK [8] If, as seems possible, the words contain God's admission that his role is, shall we say, a very demanding one, we have the pattern here again. And if so, these form the constellation: Jonah and Baruch, Jeremiah and Job. By what they say or by what is said to them, each in his way illustrates the theme: a man's troubles, matched and dwarfed by God's own hurt. There is hardly enough of this to stamp it a dominant feature of Old Testament religion, yet the pattern occurs frequently enough to be recognized. Against human sorrow, a sort of antidote to self-pity, here and there the reminder appears that all is not too well on high; God, too, knows pain. Now this thought, that God knows pain, the pain of fru stration, deserves a second look. Why cannot the lord of creation, the sole author of human history, merely direct events on earth according to his pleasure and spare himself this pain? What is the ineluctable source of his hurt? I suspect that the answer is simple and that from this point onward I am belaboring the obvious. Is it not a conflict between God's justice and his commitment which creates the divine dilemma and the grief — his justice at odds with his commitment? The author of Genesis 18 gave classic expression to the first of these two conflicting elements, when, with a rhetorical question, his Abraham sharply defined God's nature: השפט כל הארץ לא יעשה משפט, "Must not the Judge of all the earth be just?" "Is it possible," Abraham went on to say, "that you should do such a monstrous thing — to slay the innocent with the guilty, treating both alike?" He all but admonished God: "Remember, it is only within these limits that you are free."8 In the context of Abraham's question, not treating the in nocent and guilty alike only meant not destroying the innocent 8 The suffering righteous Job along with Jeremiah appealed only to God's characteristic justice; cf. Jer. 11.20; 12.1 ; 18.19 f.; Job 13.15, 18; 23.3 f. Cf. also Blank, "The Confessions of Jeremiah and the Meaning of Prayer,', HUCAHUCA XXI (1948), p. 344; "Men Against God," JBL, LXXII (1953), pp. 8 f.</page><page sequence="9">[9] "DOEST THOU WELL TO BE ANGRY?" 37 residents of Sodom along with the guilty; it is this one aspect of justice that Abraham had in mind. But justice is two-edged. Not treating the innocent and guilty alike also meant not sparing the guilty. In its positive form, the principle is fully stated in the related eighteenth chapter of Ezekiel. Here the principle צדקת הצדיק עליו תהיה is supplemented by the further assertion ורשעת הרשע עליו תהיה, "the innocence of the innocent shall be upon him and the guilt of the guilty shall be upon him" (v. 20). Whether they were thinking in terms of communal retribution or in terms of individual retribution, the writers of the Bible expected God, on the one hand, to reward merit, but, on the other, as surely, to punish guilt. Couple with this expectation the fact that, for the most part in the Bible, it rests with men to choose the way of innocence or guilt, a thought which a talmudic authority9 expressed in the form הכל בידי שמים חוץ מיראת שמים, "Everything is in the power of God except the fear of God" — couple these, and the limits are more clearly drawn. If God must punish and men may choose, here is a situation which sets bounds to God's freedom. Circum stances, man-made situations, may constrain God to visit punishment. It is such constraint that dictates God's word through Jeremiah: "I have to demolish what I built, uproot what I planted." So one speaks who sees no alternative, who has no choice more. The same constraint would have caused the de struction of Nineveh, were it not for that city's last minute change of heart. Constrained again, God brought on the waters of the flood, though it grieved his heart to destroy his new-made earth. This is the one of the two warring elements: God's justice, which is so much a part of his nature that it limits his freedom. The second element, with which the first comes into open conflict, giving rise to tension and causing distress, is God's commitment, or, as it is sometimes conceived, his purpose. It is, for the most part, his commitment to his people, his purpose with Israel. But it is also his broader purpose, his scheme of י The first generation Amora R.

BLANK [10] universal salvation.10 The prophet Jeremiah was referring to God's constancy in relation to Israel when he characterized God as חסיד: "Come back, recalcitrant Israel!" God says, "I do not frown on you, For I am constant (כי חסיד אני) ; I bear no lasting grudge" (Jer. 3.12)." Though the pre-exilic prophets repudiated a one-sided covenant, the people stubbornly insisted that a promise is a promise and, like Jeremiah, one of the Isaiahs thought in such terms. Deutero Isaiah, or whoever wrote Isaiah 54.8-10, used the related word חסד for a new covenant with Israel — a one-sided covenant which would, in fact, be better named a divine commitment: "In a sudden burst of wrath Momentarily I hid my face from you, But (now) I comfort you with a firm commitment (בחסד עולם), Saith God, your redeemer. This is to me as the waters of Noah; Even as I swore that no more 10 Which, indeed, he means to carry through. This is the sense of Isa. 46.10b. God is "he who says 'My counsel stands, and all that I will to do I do.' " This is the same as saying: "I will not be frustrated in my purpose." Salvation (ישע) in 51.5 is more than national deliverance from a present danger; its scope is universal (cf. זרעי עמים ישפטו אלי איים יקוו and the related Isa. 2.4). And the term צדק which occurs as a synonym parallel to ישע in 51.5 has a special meaning in this context. As elsewhere in Deutero-Isaiah it connotes "victory" (41.2; 45.13; 41.10), here it seems to designate the triumph of God's plan for his world. So also, probably, in 45.19 (דובר צדק) where it follows immediately upon the statement of God's purpose quoted above (p. 34): 45-18) לא תהו בראה לעבת יצרה). I believe that my teacher, Julian Morgenstern, first suggested to me this meaning of צדק in 45.19 and 51.5 when we were working together on these chapters in a seminar. See also Blank, "The Mission of Israel: Biblical Origins," in Report of the Sixth International International Conference, World Union for Progressive Judaism, London, 1949, pp. 69 f. 11 Similarly Jer. 31.20: "I have to remember him" (above, p. 32); also Isa. 49.15: נם אלה תשכחנה ואנכי לא אשכחך; Isa. 54-6: ואשת נעורים כי תמאס; Isa. 66.9: האני אשביר ולא אוליד.</page><page sequence="11">[11] "DOEST THOU WELL TO BE ANGRY?" 39 Would the waters of Noah deluge the earth So I have sworn not to be angry with you Or chastise you (more). Yea, the mountains may pass away And the hills remove, But my commitment (חסדי) from you never — Not my covenant of peace (ברית שלומי)." A promise is a promise, they insisted; a commitment is a commitment. God can no more repudiate a promise than he can be unjust. He cannot be capricious. Constancy is the very essence of God.12 It is wholly unlike him to assault a friend, and his encounters with Jacob on the river bank and Moses on the road to Egypt are properly viewed as curious vestiges of an ancient demonism long outgrown. For the most part in the Bible, impulse had given way to principle. The author of Job devised a story to show what inconstancy might lead to. Once upon a time, God acted on an impulse, he tells us, and went on to regret it. The reproachful tone of God's words to Satan reveals his regret. "You persuaded me to attack him without provocation," God complains, ותסיתני בו 13לבלעו חנם (Job 2.3). And the author evolves the plot of the Job story out of the violence done by this' impulsive act to the belief in God's constancy, which belief, of course, his hero-victim can never abandon. Job's God must be constant — he cannot abuse a friend, be the friend a person or a people, Israel or mankind. According to the thinking of biblical man, this, then, is a second limitation of God's freedom. And perhaps it should be noted here that the two limiting factors have what may be called a moral quality in common. The requirement that God remain true to his commitment shares with the requirement that he be just, a moral quality. There is no mechanical necessity involved like that by which natural effects flow necessarily 1212 Cf. Num. 23.19; I Sam. 15.29. On God as warder of contracts, see Blank, "The Confessions of Jeremiah and the Meaning of Prayer," HUCA XXI (1948), p. 334. 1ג For this use of חנם cf. Ezek. 6.10 and, perhaps, also Isa. 52.5.</page><page sequence="12">40 SHELDON H. BLANK [12] from natural causes, nor any logical necessity like that which makes inevitable the conclusion of a syllogism — no formal or philosophical necessity. What is involved is a moral necessity — a constraint dictated by moral considerations. This, in passing, is what the two warring elements have in common — a moral quality. A moral necessity demands that in a given situation a a just God will act in a certain way. And in the same situation, a moral necessity restrains a God committed to a different course from acting in that certain way. The consequences of God's moral nature are at variance with his purpose. And thus the stage is set for conflict, tension, indecision, frustration, and hurt. One such situation is that to which God alludes in his word to Baruch. What he built and now must demolish, what he planted and must uproot, is the very people of whom he said: "How can I give thee up, O Ephraim; deliver thee over, Israel?" (Hosea 11.8). There is something satanic about this dilemma. It is the perfect consummation of Beelzebub's plot against God's créa tures, the fruit of his counsel. In Milton's words, the prince of evil said of men : perhaps yet we may "Seduce them to our party, that their God May prove their foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge and interrupt his joy In our confusion, and our joy upraise In his disturbance . . ."14 Milton wrote the words for our scene and Wagner the music. The music is the "Unmut Motif" in the Valkyrie, the musical accompaniment to Wotan's distress: "In my own fetters fast am I, I least free of all living," "In eig'ner Fessel fing ich mich, ich unfreiester Aller."15 This is the music to fit God's mood of indecision, frustration, and hurt. We have found the mood, found it exemplified in a few memorable passages. We have analyzed it — sought its genesis 1י• Paradise Lost, II 11. 368 ff.

And we have noted in passing the force or effect of a reference in the context of human grief to the analogous mood of God. It remains only to make explicit what has been suggested in this last respect. What is the effect of a reference to God's pain in a context of human grief? It is this: that it provides a sense of proportion, lends to the human situation a divine perspective. The biblical author achieves this effect by the bold device of setting up against human self-pity the high tragedy of God's own hurt. Nowhere in the Hebrew Bible do the "personhood" of God and his entanglement in the human situation stand more clearly revealed than in this recurrent pattern.16 16 This paper was read before the British Society for Old Testament Study in Edinburgh, 1954.</page></plain_text>
