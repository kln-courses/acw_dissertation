         <title>Azad’s Statement: The Meaning of Maanna</title>
         <p>In 2003, while engaged in fieldwork on popular religion in Mumbai, I got to know a man who worked in the film studios as a sort of jack-of-all-trades—a “light boy,” in Bollywood parlance. Boyhood in the chronological sense was in fact well behind him; it was sometime back in the 1960s that he had set out from his Uttar Pradesh village to seek his fortune in the movies, and he had been settled in Mumbai ever since. His self-reinvention extended to the adoption of a nom de guerre: Chandrashekhar Azad, a composite handle made famous decades before by a nationalist hero who had joined the Hindu name Chandrashekhar with the Urdu (and thus Muslim-inflected) epithet <italic>Azad</italic>, or “free.”</p>
         <p>The latter-day Azad expounded to me one day on the religious diversity of his adopted city, long celebrated in Indian public culture—the cinema foremost among its channels—as the national metropolis, the center of modernity and cosmopolitanism: “Koi Bhagwan ko maanta hai,” he told me, “koi Allah Miyan ko maanta hai, koi God ko maanta hai, koi Sai Baba ko maanta hai.”</p>
         <p>I open this essay about Sai Baba, the unofficial patron saint of India’s largest city, with these words for several reasons. One is the bricolage of languages and affective registers typical of Mumbai street style. Going provisionally with “to believe in” as the most idiomatic way to gloss the verb <italic>maanna</italic>, Azad’s observation might be translated thus: “Some believe in Bhagwan [generically, “the Lord,” although usually denoting Vishnu or his avatars], some believe in Allah Miyan [a formulation connoting affectionate regard, something like “Mr. Allah”], some believe in <italic>God</italic> [the English word, namely, the God of the Christians], some believe in Sai Baba.” It is also an interesting sociological description. The major religious communities of Mumbai are conventionally defined as Hindus, Muslims, and Christians—Amar, Akbar, and Anthony, to cite the metonyms made popular by a well-known Hindi movie.<sup>1</sup> Identifying a fourth category and naming it after Sai Baba, however, might seem like a departure from the script to anyone not familiar with the city.</p>
         <p>Who is, or was, this Sai Baba? In the usage of somebody like Azad—a representative of subaltern Mumbai, a labor migrant, like so many others, from a backcountry village—what does he stand for? Is the name functioning here as the signpost of a fourth confessional division, in supersession perhaps of Jains, Parsis, or Buddhists (to name three other Mumbai constituencies)? Or is “Sai Baba” rather being deployed as a sort of taxonomic punchline, a final term to encompass or transcend the others? Azad’s verb <italic>maanna</italic> can also be rendered “to submit to” or “to honor/to revere”; how would one of these alternative constructions recast the relation he draws between religious communities and the objects of their devotion?</p>
         <p>In a broader Indian context the name <italic>Sai Baba</italic> (or title—the two words in combination are semantically somewhat slippery) can refer to more than one spiritual master. But there can be no doubt that the contender named in Azad’s lineup of heavyweights is Sai Baba of Shirdi. To say this personage commands a high profile in Mumbai would be an understatement. The figure of the lean, bearded saint, circulated in a handful of stereotyped forms on mass-produced artifacts of visual culture, is virtually ubiquitous in urban space. A visitor to the city will encounter the Baba printed on stickers, labels, and the surfaces of wall-mounted tiles; enthroned as a tiny effigy on dashboards; and above all enshrined in a myriad of structures, from makeshift altars to booths to open-sided rooms on the public streets. And the first point of information that an inquisitive visitor will learn about the icon is that this eminently ordinary-looking old man—raggedly garbed, humble, even undernourished looking—is recognized as an embodiment of divine presence by Mumbai residents regardless of their religious affiliation.</p>
         <p>Indeed, it would not be going too far to state that an ecumenical compass has become the defining characteristic of the saint’s public. In the Mumbai area, the cult—or more precisely, as I will argue, the image—retains a crossover appeal that makes Sai Baba emblematic of a reified notion of Hindu-Muslim accord. This aspect of his persona is summed up in the Hindi maxim that circulates in citation of the sum of his teachings: <italic>Sab ka malik ek</italic> (The lord of all is one). One widely reproduced portrait bearing the slogan superimposes a temple, a mosque, and a church on the Baba’s breast; the image of the One Lord who encompasses the sectarian trio is the graphic equivalent of Azad’s exposition, whose scheme delivers Sai Baba to trump Amar, Akbar, and Anthony alike.</p>
         <p>A saint who preached a gospel of tolerance and inclusion—how remarkable, yet how seemingly apposite, to find evidence of dedication to his creed in every corner of this city! How eloquent of the possibilities of urban cosmopolitanism, as critiqued in the Mumbai context by Arjun Appadurai, Sunil Khilnani, and others!<sup>2</sup> But tempting though it may seem to read Sai Baba’s visual proliferation as an embrace of his teachings, it would be a delicate task indeed to map any such move onto the complex social geography of the city, where “Hindu” and “Muslim” not only continue to inscribe bounds of identity but do so in more than strictly doctrinal terms, their circumscriptions overlapping with other categories’, including those of class, caste, and ethnolinguistic loyalty. More delicate yet, once contextualized historically, any such proposition would contend with a disjuncture between what could be tracked chronologically of the icon’s spread and Mumbai’s unfortunate record of communal strife.</p>
         <p>Just who is it, then, among the population that makes such a point of displaying allegiance to the Baba? And what does it mean to believe in him? Pivoting off a critical engagement with meaning and belief—as conventionally foregrounded in history-of-religions approaches—my argument here will consider the extant scholarship on Shirdi’s holy man and his cult. I will move on to offer an original thesis to unfold along the following points.</p>
         <p>First, that understanding the Sai Baba phenomenon begins with reframing it as a problem in visual culture and that to think about the visual is also to think about space. Second, that the spread of the Sai Baba icon—a distinctly modern kind of image—is related to Mumbai’s standing as a distinctly postcolonial kind of space, with a history of contestation over how the city configures public space. Third, that understanding how the icon operates in public among diverse constituencies of viewers requires a theoretical engagement with <italic>darshan</italic>, or the practice of visual worship. I will propose a model of the <italic>darshan</italic> encounter on the paradigm not of faith or belief, but rather of recognition.</p>
         <p>In so arguing, I will advance through three historical scenarios. In the first, a turn-of-the-twentieth-century moment, I will look to the circuit of pilgrimage to the Baba’s seat at Shirdi as described in the cult’s central scripture, the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>. In the second, I will invoke Indian public culture in 1977, the last year of Indira Gandhi’s Emergency Rule, when two hit movies introduced subaltern publics to authoritative figurations of the saint. Finally and most importantly, I will present some elements of the fieldwork research I pursued in Mumbai in 2003, moving toward the November morning when, acting in the name of the public interest, the authorities launched a demolition campaign against “illegal religious structures” that was visited primarily on Sai Baba sites.</p>
         <p>Traditionally favored approaches to the study of saints and their cults—in South Asia and elsewhere—have failed to grasp the logic of the dissemination of this particular saint’s icon across the urban landscape.<sup>3</sup> The metropolitan embrace of the country preacher from Shirdi is, in my view, best analyzed at the nexus of visual studies and urban ethnography. Accordingly I have looked to the perspectives of scholars in the anthropology of art and semiotics for guidance in problematizing two vectors of the way the sacred image operates: (1) its relation to its spectator, or addressee and (2) its relation to the space that surrounds it.</p>
         <p>In deemphasizing what the image represents, or describes—the historical individual Sai Baba, the corpus of his teachings—I take a position not strictly speaking against meaning as such, but perhaps against mimetic representation. This is not so much a statement of philosophical principle as a response to the peculiar sense of semiotic shallowness that kept bemusing me in my encounters with the Sai Baba icon. In what remains of this introduction, I will consider some of what might be brought to the surface by biographical, theological, and iconographic lines of inquiry and then move to my own, historically and ethnographically grounded excavation, directed not at meanings but effects.</p>
         <p>Biographically speaking, then, Sai Baba was a charismatic who was based in the village of Shirdi, in Aurangabad District in what is now central Maharashtra State, well into the twentieth century. Marianne Warren, the most academically grounded of his biographers in English, dates his fleshly career from the late 1830s to 1918.<sup>4</sup> It may be noted that the period coincides with the advent of modern technologies of mass reproduction in India and elsewhere, as well as with the heyday of colonial rule (with its implications for the development of the region’s infrastructure and the imposition on the populace of a bureaucratized taxonomy of religious identity). Over the last century, even as the site of Sai Baba’s tomb has been built up in the style of a conventional Hindu temple complex, the record of his words and works has become overgrown with the no less conventional tropes of Hindu hagiography. But on the basis of a contextualization of the record within the religious milieu of the day, Warren argues that the historical Baba of Shirdi, who made his home in a ruined mosque, preached and comported himself in accordance with norms observed by contemporary Sufi masters.</p>
         <p>Warren’s case for situating him alongside other Muslim mystics active in the period thus lays down a marker against the saint’s present-day adoption as an object of devotion within mainstream Hinduism.<sup>5</sup> One tried and true tactic whereby heterodox or antinomian charismatic figures have historically been assimilated within the orthodox caste hierarchy is to endow them with Brahmin birth parents—once separated from whom they commence their dharmic missions among low-caste or otherwise marginal groups—and in the case of Sai Baba the story nowadays seems to have attained the status of something like conventional wisdom.<sup>6</sup> Ritual and rhetorical interventions along these lines notwithstanding, however, not even the staunchest Hindu chauvinists have yet succeeded in erasing his Muslim antecedents altogether.<sup>7</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Indeed, Sai Baba finds good company among other maverick charismatics rehabilitated as Brahmin foundlings, of whom the most illustrious names are perhaps the fifteenth-century North Indian poet-saints Kabir and Ravidas. Contra the blurb copy on my edition of one popular hagiography, <italic>Sai Baba of Shirdi: A Unique Saint</italic>—which runs in part, “In all of India’s history, there has never been another like him. He is not a conventional saint.…He made no pretensions to scholarship yet he had a profound insight into both Hindu and Islamic scriptures.…He performed “miracles” but in no manner of means to impress anyone.…Sai Baba in every way remains unique”<sup>8</sup>—the profile actually fits many other historical and modern individuals, particularly those whose popularity in subaltern contexts indexes the power to heal various afflictions.<sup>9</sup> In asking the question, Why is it Sai Baba, of all these personages, whose visage should end up installed in public as the universal access point to divine power?, I invite attention also to its flip side: What is it about him that has made his gesture of universal address so open to cooptation by Hindu elites, and possibly others?</p>
         <p>I contend that reading his actual teachings is unlikely to yield the answer to either question, for the reason that such lessons as the sage has left us are cryptic or confrontationally gnomic in style.<sup>10</sup> They have been transmitted as utterances or exemplary gestures, narrativized by his followers in didactic anecdotes that correspond to patterns familiar to students of South Asian hagiographical texts. The corpus offers thin gruel to any prospective devotee looking for routinized instructions to follow, much less a substantial doctrine to believe in.</p>
         <p>As collected in the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>, the closest thing the cult has to a canonical text, a “recurring lesson encountered in these stories is Shirdi Sai Baba’s all-pervasiveness and accessibility”;<sup>11</sup> indeed, what is at stake in the anecdotes frequently hinges on the Baba’s appearance—the manifestation and recognition of his authentic, divine image—to a devotee in a moment of pious anticipation or, conversely, of alienation. This is the visual relation glossed in the <italic>Satcharita</italic> with the (principally) Hindu term <italic>darshan</italic>. It might be said that the blessing of the guru’s vision in itself satisfies a host of questions, and I will examine the apparitions described in the <italic>Satcharita</italic> in some detail below. Again, however, my point is that coherence at the level of doctrine is not an emphasis of the text. Nor is there any overarching institutional structure that could direct coherence in interpretation, let alone mobilize a proselytizing campaign. The body that administers the pilgrimage complex at Shirdi, the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan, runs all of one official temple in Mumbai (it consists of an upper-floor prayer room next to the office). With this single exception, none of the myriad outposts that enshrine the Baba on the city’s streets and walls, the apartment houses and office buildings, are subject to a central authority.</p>
         <p>It is this very mimetic shallowness, I would argue, that has facilitated the assimilation of the Baba’s distinctive legacy within the ritual norms of modern Hinduism. In fact, as I illustrate toward the end of this essay, the Shirdi site has itself become thoroughly made over in this way by none other than the legacy’s executors, the trustees of the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan. (To gesture at a touchstone of Hindu studies, it could be said that the Sansthan’s priorities lie with orthopraxy over orthodoxy.) Here it remains to add that a close reading turns up the familiar combination of Hindu-Islamic cross-pollination and semantic poverty collapsed within the saint’s very name: <italic>sai</italic>, meaning “master,” “god,” or “Muslim ascetic,” plus <italic>baba</italic>, an informal term of address for “father,” “grandfather,” or “holy man”; thus <italic>Sai Baba</italic>, “Master Father,” or possibly “Reverend Dad,” with the curious detail that the <italic>Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary</italic> traces the part with the specifically Islamic association to an Indic derivation, <italic>svaamin</italic> (as in “swami”) and the thoroughly colloquial <italic>baba</italic> back to Persian.</p>
         <p>Meaning as the object of belief, to repeat, is somehow beside the point. To make free with some Weberian language, what is going on might rather be conceptualized as the transference of the prophet’s charisma from his physical person, not to a codified body of scripture, but to his visual trace as manifested in graphic or plastic form. I look again to the opening statement presented by the light boy Azad, and to his use of the multivalent verb <italic>maanna</italic> as a cue. I question whether my interlocutor was actually stating that his friends and neighbors “believe in” the Sai Baba image.</p>
         <p>An iconographic survey of Sai Baba pictures produced for devotional purposes over the decades would turn up some interesting mimetic referents, many having to do with the conversion of the fakir persona into a form more consistent with the typological standards of modern Hindu god poster art.<sup>12</sup> The style might be described as a sort of fabulous hyperrealism, with bright colors, flattened perspective, and smooth, rounded surfaces among its highlights. Anthropomorphic figures are typically given a static presentation that, citing the formal contours and positioning or staging of cultic objects (<italic>murti</italic>s) in temples, invites the adoring gaze of the viewer. In line with these norms, devotional prints of Sai Baba limit themselves in the main to a few stereotyped postures: full-frontal standing, full-frontal seated cross-legged, full-frontal facial portrait.</p>
         <p>In a recent article, Karline McLain has presented a nuanced reading of a representative set of images, with one line of interpretation stressing the Hindu or Muslim coding of particular motifs and graphic details.<sup>13</sup> It is important to note that successive editions of poster images can incorporate all sorts of compositional interventions, notably in color. It thus becomes possible to track Hinduization across reissues of devotional pictures. For example, the white kerchief donned by the saint in a style typical of a Muslim mendicant has in many contemporary renditions been given a Hindu-coded saffron color. For my purposes, however, it is even more important to note that all iterations of mass-market Sai Baba art are derived from a small pool of source images: a set of historical photographs.<sup>14</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Let me state briefly what I see at stake here. A charismatic figure in whom devotees recognize an embodiment of divine power (in terms of Hindu doctrine, an incarnation or avatar; in Sufi terms a saintly dispenser of <italic>barkat</italic>) has been photographed at a particular moment in colonial modernity. Photography, at the turn of the twentieth century, was one technology whose artifacts were in the process of becoming established in circulation among an Indian public; the chromolithographic process behind poster-style art was another. Sai Baba’s capture on film at this juncture presented his historical followers with a challenge that, I propose, went beyond matters of mere interpretation. They did not start by asking: What does this image describe or resemble? What does it mean in its formal details? Rather, I will argue, the question ran along the lines of: If the trace of a person who is himself a material trace of the divine has been imprinted within this new medium, does that secondary trace contain power? And to that I would add my own question: What happens when it transmits that power?</p>
         <p>“Koi Sai Baba ko maanta hai” (Some believe in Sai Baba). Let me wrap up this introduction with an alternative translation of the verb <italic>maanna</italic>. I suggest that in Azad’s formulation, the relation that connects a religious subject to an icon is one of recognition: what the worshipper does is “submit to” it, perhaps even “heed [its] call.” In the pages to follow, my analysis will center on Sai Baba not as a historical figure or theological voice but as an image—as a reproducible artifact that, mediated by locally prevailing forms and organs of visual culture, presents an ideological address to members of its viewing public and helps to construct the city as a shared space.</p>
         <p>To restate a commonplace, all visual signifiers occupy space, just as all aural signifiers take up time. All such spaces are materially constituted—even the pages of books and television screens—and are modified by the signs that mark them, although the relation of that mark to the space it occupies has not traditionally been the main concern of visual studies, let alone the history of religions. Presenting some elements of textual and ethnographic research, then, I propose to engage ideas advanced by anthropologists regarding certain kinds of images typologically identifiable as sacred in modern Indian visual culture,<sup>15</sup> exploring the operations of the Sai Baba icon within culturally contingent ways of seeing and of marking space and foregrounding the mediation of these operations by the legal-bureaucratic system and technologies of visual reproduction.</p>

         <title>The Canvas: Public Space in Contemporary Mumbai</title>
         <p>Before positioning Sai Baba as a cross-sectarian figure, a sketch of the fault lines he straddles will be helpful. Long paramount as the subcontinent’s commercial and media capital, Mumbai has a population (under)estimated at some twelve and a half million, thanks in large part to labor migration from rural Maharashtra and across India. To a casual observer traversing the streets or other public spaces, the diversity of the populace is made most apparent in a religious idiom, for such spaces are claimed by distinct religious communities through a range of visual cues: through modes of dress, particularly among women; through the temporary displays of mendicants or festival celebrants; through the facades of official houses of worship; and most of all through the unauthorized structures that claim attention from the street. The principal structures of this sort are small shrines of brick, stone, or concrete, and it is safely stated that, while shrines dedicated to various Hindu gods and Muslim, Christian, and Buddhist objects of veneration are easily met with, the most common occupant of such installations in downtown Mumbai is Sai Baba.</p>
         <p>These roadside displays can be seen together as signposts from an alternate geography, windows that open on an imaginary at variance with the logic of abstraction that dictates the straight lines and clean demarcations of the city blocks. And as such, this partitioning of urban turf is symptomatic of a deeper rift among Mumbai’s populace. Famously, the city’s very name is contested: among the urban bourgeoisie, whose classrooms, offices, and (to a lesser extent) domestic spaces are English-medium environments, the no-longer-official <italic>Bombay</italic> is still standard usage; the nativist <italic>Mumbai</italic>, with its Maharashtrian and thus rustic provenance, decidedly less so. The two versions even claim rival etymologies, each rich with its own set of associations. <italic>Bombay</italic> is attributed to the Portuguese <italic>boa bahia</italic> (good bay) of the port’s original colonial masters.<sup>16</sup> 
            <italic>Mumbai</italic> is said to be derived from Mumbadevi, the name of a local goddess (<italic>gaondevi</italic>) whose cult, as with other goddesses of this type in western and southern India, centers on veneration of her persona within a particular settlement as its emanation or embodiment. For Suketu Mehta, the renaming campaign, proceeding landmark by colonial-era landmark, heralded the emergence of the so-called <italic>ghati</italic>s—poor migrants from the Maharashtrian hill country—out of an undifferentiated, collective mass of “servants”: “This is how the ghatis took revenge on us. They renamed everything after their politicians, and finally they renamed even the city. If they couldn’t afford to live on our roads, they could at least occupy the road signs.”<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>While the social fissure indexed by this observation does cut along lines of religious community as well as of caste and primary language use, for this essay’s purposes it will be useful to retain Mehta’s emphasis on class—or, to be more analytically precise, on conflicting modes of citizenship defined by class. Here I follow the lead of Sudipta Kaviraj, who builds an argument about contested public spaces in a similar city, Kolkata, on a similarly “simple and possibly misleading distinction between the elite and the others.”<sup>18</sup> With the recognition that this kind of heuristic can distort various aspects of a highly complex urban sociology, permit me to cast my own site in a starkly post
colonial light: the Mumbai of this study is a class-riven city in which an Anglophone bourgeoisie that has inherited a conventionally liberal political culture dominates a population that functions in vernacular languages—primarily Marathi and Hindi—most of whom maintain ties with their villages of origin. The relations of this subordinate class to the urban space that it imagines, maps, and inhabits are decidedly different from those held by the liberal bourgeoisie. For a member of the elite class—whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or Parsi—the street beyond the front door is a public thoroughfare, a zone to be traversed by transient citizens under the neutral jurisdiction of a secular republic. For a subaltern urbanite, on the other hand, whatever his or her religious affiliation, it may be the legitimate abode of bodies both human and divine.<sup>19</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Again, not all of Mumbai falls to either side of a dichotomy between citizens and subalterns. Many industries and government bodies employ large numbers of white-collar members of what might be called the vernacular middle class. This is the class whose increasing visibility and clout have been located at the root of many aspects of Indian society’s transformation over the past two decades, notably the rise of the Hindu right, whose principal institutional standard bearer in Mumbai, the Maharashtrian chauvinist Shiv Sena party, not coincidentally gained traction in the 1960s and 1970s by pressuring employers to admit its supporters to the ranks of their clerical workforces.<sup>20</sup> To the Shiv Sena can be assigned the bulk of the responsibility both for the event that shattered the city’s long-cherished image as a place of cosmopolitan tolerance—the traumatic anti-Muslim “riots” of 1992–93—and for the official name change in 1995. With an eye to defending my heuristic, I think it could be argued that the volatility and insecurity characteristic of the vernacular middle class are symptomatic of its interstitial position, wedged between the starkly alternative modes of modern Indian identity bequeathed it by a colonial heritage.<sup>21</sup>

         <title>Bombay to Shirdi: The Circuit in the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>
         </title>
         <p>One hundred years ago, in the period of the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>’s compilation, the picture was very different. Bombay city occupied roughly a third of the geographical area claimed by present-day Greater Mumbai and contained a twelfth of its population. Yet the city’s broad ambit is suggested in many episodes recounted in the <italic>Satcharita</italic>. If the general purport of the text’s many pilgrimage tales is that all roads lead ultimately to Shirdi, it could be said nevertheless that on their way through the hinterland many connect with Bombay-bound junctions.<sup>22</sup> The city’s symbolic power as the locus of a definitional modernity was if anything more salient in this period. As capital of the Bombay Presidency it was the administrative hub for approximately one-third of British India, as well as the region’s principal port and center of industry and commerce. And if the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic> chronicles the collection around the master’s feet of an eclectic group of rural disciples—women as well as men, low castes as well as high, and of course Muslims as well as Hindus—there is a contrast to be noted with another set of devotees, whose travel to Shirdi in quest of the divine presence is relayed in one tale after another. Many of these seekers set out physically from Bombay and its environs, while others on the path do not. They can be grouped together, however, under the mark of a different kind of origin—a shared place within colonial modernity as members of a nascent middle class.</p>
         <p>These pioneer witnesses to the Baba’s authenticity are pillars of the community. Indeed, they are nothing less than professional men: lawyers and doctors; managers in the textile industry and in a Greek-run trading firm; functionaries in the colonial bureaucracy’s postal, railway, and revenue services. The very author of the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>, Govind Raghunath Dabholkar—styled “Hemadpant” after a famous medieval panegyrist by the guru himself—worked as a “servant of the Bombay Government and his last appointment was as a magistrate in the Bandra suburb of Bombay.”<sup>23</sup> Most of the exemplary devotees whom Hemadpant identifies are, like himself, Hindu men with Maharashtrian family names and honorifics. Their common business is the management of knowledge as mediated through paperwork. Paper circulates within their offices as the material bearer of meaning to be documented, duplicated, and authenticated; paper circulates beyond their offices to generate effects of value and power. It was precisely such colonial moderns as these, I contend, who constituted the public in this period for the products of technological processes like photography and chromolithography.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As I have already proposed, the characteristic movement of the <italic>Satcharita</italic>’s edifying tales is to stage a question, “Is the Master truly divine?” and, working through narrative, to deliver an affirmative resolution, “Behold the proof—he is indeed divine!” These tests and demonstrations are glossed, in a term from Hindu philosophy, as Sai Baba’s <italic>leela</italic>, or play—his gracious intervention into the ultimately illusory fabric, <italic>maya</italic>, of phenomenal reality. Overwhelmingly, the evidence thus adduced is made manifest visually; the revelation generally involves the display of the guru’s person, which enacts in itself the authenticating gesture. In some stories Sai Baba’s form is a vision, confined as an image to the interior of the devotee’s mind and manifested to the rest of us through verbal testimony. This is, to be sure, a standard motif in devotional literature in India and elsewhere. But in other stories Sai Baba is materially instantiated within narrative action as a picture or a photograph.</p>
         <p>Hemadpant was tasked by the Baba with writing the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic> in the 1910s—as the author himself chronicles—and published it in 1929, the year of his own death. His Marathi original is in verse. The most common English version, the slim volume published and distributed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan, is a prose translation and abridgment by Nagesh Vasudev Gunaji. In 1999 Indira Kher completed the full, line-by-line translation that I rely on in this essay. The Sai Baba biographer Marianne Warren, who gave support to Kher’s project, has noted of the older, Sansthan-certified redaction that Gunaji seems to have edited away much of the Sufi language present in the original, thus reinscribing the Baba’s historical words and works with a Hindu, and specifically Vedantic, emphasis.<sup>25</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The first thing to remark in examining the place of photography in the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic> is its documentation of a specific image that has become central to the Shirdi-based cult. The Baba is portrayed gazing pensively into the lens, seated with his right leg crossed over his knee at the ankle, left fingers draped across his right foot. The photograph (a life-sized print that was likely overpainted with gouache, per the typical Indian practice)<sup>26</sup> was mounted in one part of the pilgrimage complex at Shirdi while the saint was still in residence. After his physical passing in 1918 it was reinstalled at the center of the tomb-cum-temple space (<italic>samadhi mandir</italic>). In 1957 it was replaced in its turn by a three-dimensional copy executed in marble, which occupies pride of place to this day at Shirdi as the central object of cultic attention (<italic>murti</italic>).<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>This definitive Baba-pose has subsequently been disseminated across Mumbai and, to a lesser extent, the rest of India in a range of graphic and plastic media. It is singled out by Hemadpant as a figuration that lends itself to meditation; in 22:9–25 (i.e., chap. 22, verses 9–25), he compares the Baba’s right toe as seen through his left fingers to the new moon framed in the branches of a tree—a luminous point on which the practitioner can train his or her focus. Elsewhere in the text, the master himself affirms that the portrait enshrined at Shirdi is to be equated with his presence (and, more broadly, with the presence of the divine). In 28:187–214, his intimate Megha worships the photograph, which is mounted inside the building of which he is the caretaker. One morning Megha “had a vision as he lay awake on his bed.…Although his eyes were closed, his mind was fully awake, when he clearly saw Baba’s figure” (28:190–91). The guru speaks, commanding him to draw a trident, a symbol of Shiva. Opening his eyes, the disciple sees the doors are all locked; he gets up and visits the adjacent mosque. “Megha narrated his vision in detail. Baba then said, ‘What vision? Did you not hear my words.…Calling it a “Vision,” are you trying to evaluate my words’” (28:196–98)? Chastened, Megha returns to his room and draws the symbol on the wall. The next day a pilgrim arrives with a stone Shiva linga, which the master passes on to Megha, instructing him to install Shiva’s worship object next to Shiva’s graphic symbol—and, of course, next to his own photographic emanation on the wall.</p>
         <p>A survey of the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic> turns up other tales in which the Baba’s power is made evident or accessible through the device of a physical picture. In 9:70–115, a factory manager in suburban Bandra, member of a reformist sect that abjures Hindu <italic>puja</italic> as idolatry, becomes persuaded by his son to practice the ritual before a “drawing” of Sai Baba (9:74). In 28:24–35, an employee of a Bombay trading house sees an old, bearded man in a dream and subsequently recognizes the saint in a photograph during a performance of devotional music. In 33:45–50, the victim of a scorpion sting prays before the guru’s photo and is cured by ash from the incense burned before it. In the same chapter, verses 141–232 tell of a well-known singer of kirtan hymns from Bombay—a story I will cite further on—and also of a government official in Thana District, north of the city, who develops Sai devotion through worship of a photograph and is rewarded with a visit from an enigmatic bearded man. In 46:22–90, a member of the circle of intimates at Shirdi sets off on a pilgrimage to the distant sites of Banaras and Gaya; he seeks Sai Baba’s blessing, is told the master will precede him, and is appropriately schooled when he encounters the Baba in pictorial form at the house of a Brahmin in Gaya. And in 51:17–96, the same devotee is dispatched to a nearby town with the sacred photograph off Megha’s wall in order to have the glass in the frame repaired. Serendipitously he meets an impressive figure, a London-returned political candidate, and gives him a revelatory preview of the <italic>darshan</italic> to be attained at Shirdi by lifting the dust cover off the photo.</p>
         <p>There is one more story that deserves closer attention. In chapter 40, verses 113–75 narrate a story about Hemadpant himself that is continued in the following chapter through verse 73. On the morning of the Hindu festival of Holi in 1917 the author—who, it will be recalled, lived in Bandra, adjoining Bombay proper—is visited in a dream. The guru announces to his devotee that he will be joining his family for lunch. Hemadpant instructs his wife to lay an extra place, and the Holi guests—family members and close friends—assemble in anticipation. “Suddenly, footsteps were heard on the staircase.…As I slowly unbolted the door, I saw two persons on the stairs. One of them was Alli Mohamed and the other, a disciple of [Peer] Maulana, Ismu Mujawar by name” (40:139–41). The Muslims apologize for interrupting the holiday meal and ask the author to accept an item that belongs rightfully to him. “So saying, Alli took out a parcel from under his arm and…began to untie the knot. As he removed the newspaper wrapping, in that instant was seen a bas-relief of Sai” (40:145–46). Alli and Ismu then excuse themselves, leaving the Hindus to celebrate with their guest of honor.</p>
         <p>Nine years pass before Hemadpant meets Alli again, in a chance encounter on the street. Finally Alli explains himself. He had purchased the Sai Baba image from a trader in Bombay and used to take <italic>darshan</italic> of it alongside the portraits of four Muslim charismatics.<sup>28</sup> But Alli falls ill and leaves his house to convalesce with his brother-in-law Noormohamed. Some time before, he had given Noormohamed a portrait of his own spiritual master, Baba Abdul Raheman, which Noormohamed took in his turn to a Bombay photographer’s shop. “He got a fine picture made from it, of the great Baba Abdul himself, in order to take it to him as a present.…He got copies made and gave them to all the relatives and close friends” (41:37–38). But Noormohamed finds, to his great distress, that when he presents the picture he is accused of idol-worship and driven from Baba Abdul’s <italic>darbar</italic>. He takes the lesson: “‘Even though much money has been spent to collect these pictures, there is no other way now, but to immerse them in water’” (41:47), and not content with drowning his own photos, he reclaims the copies he had given away.</p>
         <p>“I too, was ill at the time and staying with him. So he advised me similarly, saying that, ‘these pictures bring calamities. Hence when you collect all of them and immerse them in the sea, only then will you get rid of your illness’” (41:55–56). Alli sends for his servant to remove the images from his own house and dispose of them. When at length he returns home, recovered, he discovers that the bas-relief of Sai Baba mysteriously remains on the wall. “It was no use keeping it in my house, for the moment my brother-in-law would see it, he would immerse it. But I could not give it away, with any certainty, to someone who was not a devotee” (41:63). He consults with Ismu Mujawar, the disciple of a different Sufi master, and together they arrive at the happy resolution to entrust Hemadpant with the miraculous image.</p>
         <p>By this point the didactic purport of the story will appear familiar. Sai Baba’s image manifests itself in one medium (a dream) to test his disciple’s faith—perhaps <italic>trust</italic> is a better formulation—in the authority of the image, and the trust is then confirmed and rewarded through a second, gracious manifestation in a different but equally authentic visual medium (a picture). But recall Azad’s <italic>maanna</italic>: not “belief,” but “submission.” The question implied in this story, and in the others, is not of the correctness of doctrine or the persuasiveness of argument, but of the legitimacy of a claim to power. Let me invoke, as a metaphor, the sort of office papers these early patrons of the Sai Baba cult had been processing in their work lives. At stake is not the accuracy of the information communicated through language on a given sheet of paper; what is at stake is rather the imprimatur, the validating stamp at the bottom.</p>
         <p>If the stamp is legitimate, then what it certifies is true. It may then be asked whether the system or dispensation that backs the stamp up (the credit guaranteed by a banker, the writ of the British Raj) is to be recognized as having a claim over the subject. And yet further, the kind of work the stamp does in citing that regime of value or power might also be brought into question. In other words—to move back from rubber stamps to sacred pictures—one concern these stories share is with the efficacy of photography as a medium. I should state that by this I do not mean a medium of representation, strictly speaking; what I have in mind is rather a sort of praxis that mediates the devotee’s relation of submission to the master, of which more later.<sup>29</sup> Here, however—resistant though I am to reducing what photographs do to matters of signification—the most conceptually clear way I can find to refine the point at hand is to borrow two terms from the semiotics of Charles S. Peirce.</p>
         <p>Peirce’s iconic mode connects a sign to its object on the basis of a formal resemblance. Thus a picture of Sai Baba “is” or “means” Sai Baba because it looks like him. The indexical mode connects the sign to its object via a relation of causality or contiguity. Thus the ash produced by the sacred flame he tends “is” Sai Baba, as is his trace on the plate that comes out of a camera he has posed in front of.<sup>30</sup> Tales like the Visitation at Holi are told to justify the iconic operations of devotional pictures through the indexical logic of the narrative of events. The point is to make a photograph as legitimate a way for Sai Baba to make his person apparent as the traditional mode of appearance in a dream. In the inaugural event of this tale the Baba arrives in a dream, and then <italic>x</italic> happens…and then <italic>y</italic> follows…until at the chain’s conclusion the equivalence is established with his return in a photographic image.</p>
         <p>Of course, this reading relies on the premise that indexical logic was adduced by preference, in this period, in discourses about religious signs and phenomena and their connection to the powers behind them. And, correspondingly, that turning to iconic logic would have been a relatively less intuitive move. But this latter premise is supported by the historical milieu as depicted in the <italic>Satcharita</italic> itself—one in which devotional pictures, relying for their effects on iconic resemblance, were modern novelties. As such they were both scarce and precious.</p>
         <p>One point of conflict in this story about how sacred images work has to do with the proscription in dogmatic Islam of idolatry and the diversity of positions represented by the Muslim characters, well-to-do citizens of Bombay and Bandra. It will be noted that not even the convinced iconoclast Noormohamed considers the pictures of the saints to be false, in the sense that they are empty or worthless. They contain power, but of a sort that will project harmful effects onto those exposed to it. Accordingly they must be eliminated—not simply discarded on the nearest rubbish heap, but neutralized in the manner approved by pious Muslims and Hindus alike when parting with ritual objects at the ritual’s conclusion: through immersion. And just as Noormohamed and Alli had expended substantial sums in obtaining their newfangled photos in the first place, so too are they prepared to pay to dispose of them. They hire boatmen and, “sailing as far into the water as [they] could,”<sup>31</sup> have them jettisoned in the Arabian Sea.</p>
         <p>Once instructed that religious pictures are dangerous, the brothers-in-law know the solution. But the depiction of Muslim Bombay here is a multivocal one, where resident Sufi saints differ on the religious implications of the new visual technologies. The distinctly Hindu language of the text, in which the Muslims represent their interactions with the pictures in terms of <italic>darshan</italic> of their gurus, can perhaps be attributed to Hemadpant’s paraphrase of their words. But it should not be missed that Noormohamed enters the story assuming he is doing honor to Baba Abdul by commissioning the photo as a prestation. Alli, the original enthusiast, never doubts through the course of events that the pictures are charged with power. Sai Baba’s wondrous endurance on his wall does not so much provoke a change of heart as bring it home to him that Sai, of all the saints, is something very powerful indeed.</p>
         <p>We who learn the story from the <italic>Satcharita</italic> know that it is Sai Baba’s person that presents the devout with an authentic point at which the divine presence can be recognized in this phenomenal world. But let me go against the grain, for a moment, of my own argument about the text’s emphasis on the charisma of the Baba’s imprimatur. It cannot be denied that this story does cast Sai Baba as the exponent of a distinctive doctrine. And what marks him apart as a teacher from his Sufi peers—who must look very similar as images, with their beards and unkempt attire—is his unequivocal position in favor of the use of pictures. In fact, he demonstrates over and over elsewhere in the <italic>Satcharita</italic>’s pages a teaching that is easy to miss in the absence of narrative contestation—and it is easy to miss precisely because it has become embraced as a central truth of Hinduism as practiced in the present day. It is this: Worship pictures. The cultivation of <italic>darshan</italic> through the iconic products of modern technology is both sound in principle and efficacious in practice.</p>
         <p>I conclude my reading of the Holi story, and the <italic>Satcharita</italic> as a whole, by remarking on two aspects of the production and consumption of sacred images as observed among Muslims and Hindus of Bombay in the 1910s. The first is that there is no indication that the pictures that circulate in this story—or elsewhere in the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>—have been consecrated at any stage by a ritual specialist. The photos’ consumers evidently bring them home from the shop ready charged, untouched by the hand of priestly middleman, their power a direct effect of their iconic relation to the divine. The second point is that they bring them <italic>home</italic>. It is clear that the <italic>darshan</italic>-images described in the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic> share their effects on a very limited circuit. Outside of Shirdi, where the cross-legged portrait is enshrined at the cult’s very center, photographs of Sai Baba appear almost exclusively on the interior walls of middle-class homes in Bombay. The Sai Baba icon cannot yet be said to circulate in public.</p>

         <title>From Basic to Elaborate: Three Exemplary Sites</title>
         <p>It should prove useful to hold onto these two points as I return from Bombay to Mumbai. If the first point—that the icon can be recognized as sacred without any ritual consecration—continues to hold true, the second—that images of Sai Baba (and other claimants to divinity) do not circulate in public—is emphatically no longer the case. The proliferation of technologies of visual reproduction such as improved processes of photographic and lithographic printing, not to mention injection molding and resin casting—multiplicity in three dimensions—has led to the mass dissemination of devotional art products. The technical aspects of this historical transformation are not as interesting, however, for the purposes of this exposition as the way the expansion of the city’s built environment and its twelvefold growth in population have combined to complicate the location of the public. In a colonial city whose masters considered the “native quarter” to be a secondary category of urban settlement, the boundary between public and private had a certain conceptual clarity, for those who cared about such things. But how is public space physically demarcated in the twenty-first-century city? And just who, out of Mumbai’s vast demographic diversity, constitutes the public as a social formation?</p>
         <p>In my overview of the urban context, I worked through several ways of categorizing contemporary rifts among the city’s population, arriving at a paired set of postcolonial subject positions: citizens and subalterns. A complementary way to define haves and have-nots in Mumbai is to look at housing situations. As in many other cities, housing (and the scarcity thereof) is an obsession that reaches across all resident communities. Even so, with twice New York’s population crammed into three-fifths its area, Mumbai is an extraordinarily crowded city. Half of this population lives in slums, if by slums are meant those sprawling neighborhoods, showing up as blank blocks of gray on the map, that fall outside of municipal jurisdiction and services such as sanitation and policing. Such dwelling places are not so much illegal as extralegal; inasmuch as they exist quite literally off the official map they can be theorized as illegible in the official gaze. But this is not to say that subaltern neighborhoods do not have systems of mapping, surveillance, and social control of their own,<sup>32</sup> not to mention their own ways of connecting to flows of water, power, and public-cultural media.</p>
         <p>Much of the flimsy and uncomfortable character of slum dwellings is attributable to the extreme contingency of their continued existence, vulnerable as they are to demolition on two legal counts: their erection as structures has not been authorized, and their occupancy of specific plots has not been registered in anyone’s name. This constant threat of demolition, and of displacement for the occupants, is a condition that extends to a special category of unauthorized dwelling: the houses of the gods who watch over the slums and their fronting streets and who are showcased in turn to the human subjects who traverse those spaces. Owing, however, to norms of piety that prevail to a great extent across all social strata of the city—and also to a liberal official ideology that stresses ecumenical respect for a diversity of religious practices—such structures, while illegal, are harder for the authorities to knock down. In effect, the guardian deities do provide protection over hearth and home in very concrete, material ways, and this is one reason for the seeming ubiquity in the slums and public thoroughfares of their shrines, which tend to get built in proximity to other, less valorized kinds of makeshift structures that house families or businesses, or on top of jury-rigged connections to municipal cables or pipes.</p>
         <p>A typical shrine, such as the one located down the block from my old house on Nepeansea Road, might comprise four elements: (1) a brick platform; (2) a spire-shaped superstructure likely to have been bought from a stonemason supplying readymade accessories for the <italic>puja</italic> rooms in private homes; (3) a <italic>murti</italic> or effigy of Sai Baba, likewise readymade; and (4) a cash box. The booth’s open face fronts the street. It is a god kiosk, as it were, a sort of Prayr-o-Mat, complete with coin slot for cash offerings. The sacred figures displayed at sites like this one take advantage of sight lines organized by the built environment to address a transient audience within the dense and constant foot and motor traffic on the Mumbai streets. They appeal, in other words, to diverse publics.</p>
         <p>Structures even this modest are commonly known in Hindi as <italic>mandir</italic>, but in this case the English gloss of “temple” supplies a poor match because there is no priest in attendance and the structure is essentially coterminous with the display—its environs are not formally contained or demarcated. Yet as a fixed, three-dimensional installation, as opposed to a display, it occupies not merely the flat surface of some other edifice but a parcel, however minuscule, of land. The little outpost operates both as a house of god—an edifice providing shelter for the spiritual presence contained in the <italic>murti</italic>—and as a public place of worship—a station at which transactions with the enshrined presence are open to whoever cares to participate. And at both levels it serves its client constituency in the same way as a “proper” temple.</p>
         <p>Contingent on the indulgence or passivity of private landlords, unofficial temples can develop, beyond the reach of the law, into fairly elaborate establishments. Thus some of the most successful streetfront <italic>mandir</italic>s in crowded South Mumbai have expanded not forward onto the pavement but backward into a host building. Among the priestly entrepreneurs whose operations fit within this category are two middle-class families of Forjett Street, in the neighborhood of Tardeo, who have converted their adjacent ground-floor apartments into complementary Sai Baba <italic>mandir</italic>s. The site, Sai Krupa, has become a local institution. On Thursday, Sai Baba’s special day, when devotees spill across the apartment building’s courtyard and along the street, the traffic is dense enough to support a small army of flower vendors in business at the threshold.</p>
         <p>The arrangements on either side of the building’s entrance are similar, with each neighbor’s foyer opening on a <italic>puja</italic> room dominated by a life-size, naturalistic sculpture of the saint, and the congregants’ observances proceed along parallel tracks. At both stations, the exchange of glances enacted through <italic>darshan</italic> with the Baba is typically accompanied by a moment of communion through silent prayer and a complementary transaction enacted at a material level: worshipers deposit offerings of cash or flowers and realize blessings conducted through food (<italic>prasad</italic>) or sacred ash (<italic>vibhuti</italic>). It is the contrasting visual idioms that dominate the two rooms—the one baroque, exuberant, decked with gilt and ornament; the other clean and spare, defined by stone surfaces and green accents—that provide the most striking indications that one shrine belongs to a Hindu household, the other to a Muslim one.</p>
         <p>The last example to be described here is a site I encountered well north of the area that had served as my base of operations, beyond the shabby-genteel arcades and avenues of South Mumbai, in the seafront suburb of Juhu. The structure in question, which occupied a spot just behind the Sea Princess Hotel, looked at first glance like a roadside cafe. The layout replicated one of the standard arrangements at such outfits, with a row of partitioned stalls open for business behind a paved strip facing the beach. A man relaxing out front who might have been a fry cook discovered between shifts turned out to be the <italic>pujari</italic> of a temple whose name ran above the stalls in big blue Hindi letters: Shiv Sai Seva Mandir.</p>
         <p>Beneath the main signboard a smaller legend in English read “Welcome.” “Is this your temple?” I asked the man, to be met with the somewhat chary reply, “It is the Lord’s.” When I pressed on with, “But you must have built it?” my interlocutor, whom I will call Om Prakash, told me: “It grew here bit by bit [<italic>aahista aahista</italic>], just like that.” To go by the name, the Shiv Sai Seva Mandir is dedicated both to Shiva and to Sai Baba, and effigies of the two divine personalities are displayed in separate “chapels.” A glossy blue Shiva seated on a lumber platform has been accessorized with his river-goddess consort, Ganga, who squirts out of his coif through a spout connected to an overhead tank; the Baba himself shares an adjacent stall with the god Dattatreya, who is particularly popular in Maharashtra, along with associated regional charismatics.<sup>33</sup>
         </p>
         <p>But the site owns to other loyalties as well. The <italic>pujari</italic>’s native place at the foot of Mount Girnar is renowned among Gujarati Hindus as a pilgrimage center. A shrine assigned to the goddess identified with Girnar, Amba Mata, has been decked with images of Om Prakash’s hometown guru. Also enshrined is Julelal, the Sindhi god of the sea, who functions alongside the Gujarati Amba and the Maharashtrian Datta as a metonym of yet another prominent Hindu constituency of the city. Finally, a central space has been reserved for an impressive-looking Christian cross, inscribed INRI in metallic letters. It was in fact the cross, the priest related, that constituted the seed from which an entire <italic>mandir</italic> just sorta growed; in a narrative movement paralleling the origin stories of many well-established Indian cultic centers, including both the Mahalaxmi Temple and Mount Saint Mary—the premier Hindu and Catholic places of worship in coastal Mumbai—a cruciform object that may or may not have been substantially identical with the one enshrined is said to have washed up on the beach at that very place, at once a gift from the sea and a sign of god’s blessing.</p>
         <p>The question of which particular god is to be recognized as the face of divine agency in this case is clearly beside the point; if the Shiv Sai Seva Mandir framed a diversity of <italic>murti</italic>s iconically linked to specific regional and sectarian affiliations, what Om Prakash stressed in our conversation was the commonality of the essences thus locally stationed. His commentary elided the distinction between god and gods; “The sea is [a] god,” he told me, motioning at the surf, the Hindi language’s lack of articles keeping it unclear whether he was simply adding another attraction to the featured cast at his establishment or advancing a statement about the comprehensive diffusion of a unitary spirit. He went on to make an equivalence that, oddly enough, can be rendered as a pun in English, although not in Hindi: “It sends waves up to wave at us,” he said, citing as evidence of the sea’s divine nature precisely the sort of gesture of recognition I will theorize as central to the operation of the sites I describe here.</p>
         <p>Whether his point is to be interpreted as attributing an immanent spirit-presence to many, most, or all places, the temple’s very purpose is of course founded on the proposition that access is more easily attained at some spots than others. But the site’s cross-sectarian embrace—as stated in principle, at any rate—was asserted in the famous words of Sai Baba posted over his shrine: <italic>Sab ka malik ek</italic> (The lord of all is one). The <italic>pujari</italic> offered free drinking water to everyone who stopped by—“And what’s a temple if not a place to slake your thirst?” He also proved hospitable with his information. Om Prakash himself was merely a Brahmin employee of a local person of means, a rich neighbor who had established the <italic>mandir</italic> at the spot initially marked by the cross. But far from manifesting on his own private property, the site so fortuitously chosen occupied public land, and it appeared that the Shiv Sai Seva Mandir’s structure had been allowed to expand to its generous proportions owing largely to its germination on a coastal plot belonging to the port authority—a body whose policy toward such unauthorized growths was evidently more lenient than the municipal government’s.</p>

         <title>The Mass Invades the Media: Bombay in the 1970s</title>
         <p>In the recollection of many downtown residents, the Baba’s popularity as a cultic figure and the corresponding plethora of public shrines were not even a discernable Bombay phenomenon until the mid-1970s. This period was dominated, politically and culturally, by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s imposition of a state of Emergency Rule: nearly two years from 1975 to 1977 during which civil liberties were suspended and the Congress Party’s enemies squashed. Public discourse of the day was marked by something of a moral panic about the growth of slums, which were identified as the symptom of a breakdown in the national project on several levels. The great promise of the Nehru years, that a centralized development policy would create prosperity for all, was deemed to have failed. The contours of a national modernity given shape (albeit imperfectly, from the first) by Bombay as India’s showcase city appeared increasingly flimsy. And the jerry-built “encroachments” that seemed to keep expanding, out of control, into the zone of the public came to be connected with several of the Emergency’s key themes: Congress’s vaunted restoration of law and order; the simultaneous efforts it made, in a populist vein, to mobilize the newly prominent masses; and, most notoriously, the campaign of state-directed sterilization—the regime’s bid to control precisely that undisciplined and immoral tendency of the masses to keep making more of themselves. In two celebrated novels that deal with the era, some of the bitterest passages are reserved for the slum clearances that brought the Emergency home to many denizens of Indian cities: Delhi in Salman Rushdie’s <italic>Midnight’s Children</italic>, Bombay in Rohinton Mistry’s <italic>A Fine Balance</italic>. The demolitions proceeded under the slogan <italic>Gharibi Hatao</italic>, “Eliminate Poverty”—words that perhaps seem less ironic in an alternative translation: “Banish Poverty” (from the middle-class gaze, at any rate).</p>
         <p>An underexamined aspect of the political scene in 1970s Maharashtra is the association that seems to have developed between Congress and the Sai Baba icon. Then as now, the party marketed itself as the champion of Indian “secularism,” an ideology comparable with multiculturalism in the US context, whose instrumentalist implications involve appeals to voting blocs that are bounded by religious or caste identity. (The paradigmatic example is the “Muslim vote.”) Thomas Blom Hansen and others have commented to me on the suggestive role in this period of the Maharashtra party chief Y. B. Chavan, one of whose many notable accomplishments was victory in the March 1977 election that concluded the Emergency (at an all-India level the contest resulted, to Congress’s shock, in a comprehensive rout). Sai Baba’s blessing of the party’s secularist vision—and, reciprocally, its blessing of whoever exhibited the Sai Baba emblem—has been identified by some of my interlocutors in the graphic motif of the Baba’s right hand. In devotional images of the present day, the hand is itself conventionally shown blessing the viewer in a raised position. Thus, the reasoning goes, it also marks homage to the Congress, which adopted the open hand as its symbol before the election of 1980, Mrs. Gandhi’s great comeback.<sup>34</sup> Iconographic research that could pinpoint this detail’s emergence in the post-Emergency period is lacking, but it is beyond doubt that the gesture is the result of an artistic intervention. None of the historical photographs show the saint performing it—not even the cross-legged image, however natural the view has come to seem of the seated Baba with his palm held up.</p>
         <p>Historical studies of Hindi cinema have made much of its transformation in this period by the incursion of themes and character types identified with the urban poor, such as the Angry Young Man persona of the star Amitabh Bachchan.<sup>35</sup> But the moment was also notable for a different sort of cinematic encroachment. Film industry leaders and critics in the English-language press were taken by surprise when representatives of a neglected and moribund-seeming genre captured the imagination, and the box-office receipts, of mass audiences. The very first Indian films had been “mythologicals,” spectacularizing the acts of Hindu deities from epic and Purana literature, and their historically grounded “devotional” counterparts. But from dominance in the silent era the genre had become relegated, in the main, to bottom-tier productions. Indeed, the breakaway hit of 1975, <italic>Jai Santoshi Maa</italic> (directed by Vijay Sharma), was itself a modest effort, its overall look distinctly downmarket.<sup>36</sup> The gaudy colors, crude special effects, and stagey mise-en-scène begin to make sense, however, when the film is examined alongside its evident source of visual inspiration: mass-produced devotional art. At the formal level, <italic>Jai Santoshi Maa</italic> realized a cinematic encoding of the god-poster aesthetic (and the phenomenally successful Ramayana epic that debuted on television twelve years later perhaps marked the apex of the modern motion-<italic>darshan</italic> picture form). Transposed to the screen from a constituency circumscribed until then by bounds of geography and caste, an obscure goddess’s persona and mythology were re-presented iconically and circulated on a translocal scale.</p>
         <p>Two years later, not long after the Emergency’s end, the Hindi film <italic>Shirdi Ke Sai Baba</italic> (directed by Ashok Bhushan, 1977) was released. To the extent that it followed <italic>Jai Santoshi Maa</italic>’s pattern in converting the object of a local cult into the icon of a metropolitan deity, it seems to have made its mark on a more modest scale. A key distinction on this score is that—as I have argued above—from the time of the Sai Baba cult’s routinization with the compilation of the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>, the saint had always already been accessed through his icon. What <italic>Shirdi Ke Sai Baba</italic> appears to have done is disseminate that icon across Bombay and beyond, making it legible in terms of an associated personality and narrative. And possibly in synchrony with the tactics of the Maharashtra Congress Party, the film seems to have encouraged its adoption among a wide swath of the populace, including the residents of slum colonies and otherwise at-risk neighborhoods.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Shirdi Ke Sai Baba</italic> stars Sudhir Dalvi in a role he was to repeat in at least one subsequent feature, although the name first identified with the movie is generally that of a more mainstream actor, Manoj Kumar, who plays a devotee in the frame narrative. The film’s titular hero is portrayed as the mouthpiece of the conventional discourse of secularism as espoused by the Congress of the day.<sup>37</sup> In one memorable song sequence, a policeman who has converted to Sai Baba’s service sings his praise in verses that take on visual form as religious symbols: the Aum, the Islamic crescent, the Christian cross, the Wheel of the Buddhist Law, and even a sacred flame for the Zoroastrians are successively animated across the frame. Azad would recognize that tune.</p>
         <p>Sai Baba’s best-known and most cherished Bollywood moment, however, is a guest appearance in a different hit of the same year, <italic>Amar Akbar Anthony</italic> (directed by Manmohan Desai, 1977).<sup>38</sup> This playful and exuberant film, which like the Sai hagiography was released only once the Emergency was lifted, narrates a message of communal brotherhood under the guiding hand of the state that can in fact be read as squarely in accord with the party line. Three brothers of Bombay, Hindu by birth, have been raised by foster fathers in different religions. Akbar, the Muslim brother, is a comic imagining of the sort of Sufi mystic whose declamations are set to music in the <italic>qawwali</italic> style. In the sequence in question, he officiates at a prayer service convened at an artfully visualized space of syncretism: in its main outline and architectural details it seems to be a Sufi tomb, or <italic>dargah</italic>, but saffron-colored flags fly overhead, and installed within is a <italic>murti</italic> swathed in saffron cloth. This is a slightly larger than life-size marble replica of Sai Baba in the cross-legged pose derived from the photograph.</p>
         <p>Akbar is singing Sai’s praises before a mixed congregation when a mysterious blind woman crashes the party. She arrives seeking refuge from a pair of racketeers who pursue her all the way to the gate, where they are warded off by a cobra. Stumbling at the threshold, she continues toward the Baba on her knees and in her blindness performs another involuntary gesture of obeisance, knocking her head on the floor. This is the gesture that initiates a miracle. The woman raises her face, now streaked on the forehead with blood. The splash at once connotes <italic>balidaan</italic>, a sacrificial blood offering to the deity; a <italic>tika</italic>, the mark that certifies ritual purity at the conclusion of <italic>puja</italic>; and a <italic>bindi</italic>, the adornment signaling a Hindu woman’s married status.<sup>39</sup> Two flames kindle in the idol’s eyes, flying across the compound and entering the eyes of the supplicant. “Baba! I can see now,” she cries rapturously, “I can do your <italic>darshan</italic>.”</p>
         <p>Some of the trademark motifs of Sai Baba worship will already be evident from my prior exposition. For example, the grounds of equality on which Hindus and Muslims meet, united in submission to their common master; the photorealistic form in which the Lord of All is recognized—and the film’s endorsement of it as unexceptional, with the <italic>murti</italic>’s adoration by Muslims exciting no remark. Another element brings up a question I will address in the next section: that of a certain force of repulsion that complements the force of attraction. Sai Baba, it seems, welcomes all to his court—except those who approach with evil intent. The Baba’s threshold is patrolled by a cobra, which might be thought of as an autochthonous minor deity. Is it significant that the chief racketeer is a Christian, or that he is depicted as a deracinated sort of postcolonial sahib figure? Or that, simply put, he is rich?</p>
         <p>The part I focus on here, preparatory to the theoretical inquiry in the next section, is the petitioner’s recovery of her vision. To interpret this as a lesson about the Baba’s extension of grace through his image, per the script made familiar by the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>, poses no great challenge. But there are features from the film’s wider narrative that distinguish it as a 1970s-vintage telling. The exemplary subject is no longer a colonial modern blessed with access to a novel visual form in which to catch a glimpse of the Truth. Bharati, the mother figure in <italic>Amar Akbar Anthony</italic>, is a woman of the masses (of the servant classes, to recall Suketu Mehta’s self-indicting phrasing), who is cast onto the streets when heartless capitalists separate her from her slum-colony home. The curse of blindness attends her descent into urban anomie, and the film’s extravagant, even frenetic depiction of Bombay as the stage on which a fantastical plot then unfolds in a series of stunts, songs, and masquerades might suggest that—pleasurable though much of the urban pageant may seem—blindness is the actual condition of one who encounters this flimflam as reality.</p>
         <p>Indeed, the film’s ludic vision calls to mind Bombay’s philosophically resonant nickname, <italic>Mayapuri</italic>, City of Illusion. And where all is fleeting—even meretricious—illusion, it transpires that the <italic>leela</italic> of Sai Baba opens up a redemptive window. The abject Bharati does not so much find her own way to the holy man’s visage as she is driven to it in extremity. But once placed in a position to behold the master, she has but to demonstrate complete submission for the Baba to recognize her as a subject and endow her with the agency to recognize him. What results is less a miraculous transformation than a restoration to order and stability as configured by a conventional idea of a Hindu woman’s <italic>dharma</italic>: home, community, respectability, sons.</p>
         <p>Once again, Sai Baba emerges as the prophet of a modern dispensation in which pictures are not blank, nor faces anonymous. In the antic chaos of the postcolonial city this message has become, if anything, more urgent. The public reach of modern media has expanded, as has the range of media forms in dazzling variety and color, with paperwork and newspapers joined by branding, advertising, and, above all, popular cinema. In a parallel movement, the mass traffic of bodies in homogenous public spaces has rendered village- and caste-based performative modes and marks of identity atavistic and, to most, illegible. Urban modernity has reached a stage, it seems, where the Baba’s affirmation to the likes of Hemadpant that self-presentations like pictures are to be seen as persons—with histories, relationships, agency—comes to make sense to real-life Bharatis, too. As Akbar sings at the start of his encomium:

         <title>Operations in Visual Culture: Attraction and Repulsion</title>
         <p>Current debates indicate a number of approaches for theorizing the effects on viewing subjects of such valorized artifacts of visual culture. In looking to the psychoanalytic work of Jacques Lacan for critical purchase on questions of visuality, desire, and identity, I follow the lead of several anthropologists of South Asia, including Katherine Pratt Ewing, who worked with Sufis in Lahore in the 1990s.<sup>40</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Ewing’s analysis builds on a considered rejection of the Symbolic Order, the matrix of signification and repression within which, in Lacan’s scheme, most social relations are enacted. Having been conceived in terms of structural linguistics, the concept invites comparison, for historians of religion, with a structuralist model of religion. As a unitary edifice, to be sure, the Symbolic Order has been assailed by the champions of a diversity of selves it seems to shut out—most prominently theorists of gender and sexuality but also ethnographers and other critics of Lacan’s cultural parochialism. I find Ewing’s interests in this regard to be very much in tune with my own. Following a line of critique initiated by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, she maps out a postcolonial milieu in which multiple discursive and affective fields lay claim to an “elusive, multivocal shifting subject”: “Nevertheless, the phenomenon of a fixed structure of signs remains—as an ideological formation, one of several that may coexist, which when enunciated fixes subjects as ‘identities,’ or subject positions in relations of power.”<sup>41</sup> Again, “I take from Lacan the idea of a subject that may be split by its entry into language, but language of a particular sort—the signifiers of an ideology that are fixed through the process of domination. This subject may be activated by a desire for recognition that passes through a Symbolic Order, constituted out of a linguistic structure of difference.…But this Symbolic Order is not, in my view, the overarching deterministic structure that Lacan assumes it to be.”<sup>42</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Taking my cue here, I propose that what happens when a sacred display mounted in public space exerts its appeal on a pedestrian can be understood as a process of subjection or subjectification. To the degree that the moment of enunciation is experienced as effective, the subject attains a recognition contingent on subjection to a regime of power relations (which may be configured both discursively and nondiscursively, <italic>pace</italic> Lacan, through somatic and affective modes) that is determinative, albeit imperfectly, of his or her autonomy and of the norms and bounds of social personhood. In the case at hand, <italic>darshan</italic> provides the enunciation, and the domain thus entered is one mediated in large part by religious discourses and practices.</p>
         <p>One salient aspect of the Lacanian framework, which has been enthusiastically taken up by cinema studies, is its elevation of the visual as a privileged channel of enunciation. If the god masked by the enshrined <italic>murti</italic> be identified as the object of its devotee’s scopic drive, it is surely suggestive that according to Lacan and his more doctrinaire followers the scopic relation is initiated not by the viewer as an agent, but rather by the Other that affirms the viewer as a subject in the first place through the gesture of recognition: “the subject of vision is itself an object of representation, because what determines the subject is a look that is outside—for Lacan, in the field of the visible: ‘I am looked at, that is to say, I am a picture.’”<sup>43</sup> Compare the <italic>Shri Sai Satcharita</italic>: “The <italic>darshan</italic> of Sai Baba’s photograph is the same as his <italic>darshan</italic> in person. But there has to be full, complete trust and you will receive the mark at the right time.”<sup>44</sup> Reminiscent of the <italic>Amar Akbar Anthony</italic> scenario examined in the previous section, this statement can be broken down in analytic terms that complement its theological assumptions. Sai Baba—the pictured object of desire whose reciprocating gaze is sought—is also the agent of enunciation, who extends the gesture (“the mark”) that integrates, or interpellates, the desiring subject within an ideological dispensation. The condition of recognition is surrender to the guru’s mastery. Number 8 of Sai Baba’s “Eleven Assurances,” which is printed in English on some of his images, offers a more succinct formulation. “If you look to me,” Sai promises, “I look to you.” If you recognize this picture as me, I recognize you as a picture.</p>
         <p>There are other things to be said about <italic>darshan</italic> that are not as theoretically abstruse as this Lacan-inspired model of recognition. The concept is central to Hindu thought and ritual discourse, although it is important to remember that not all the images that project a visual address on Mumbai’s streets hail from Hindu traditions. To “do <italic>darshan</italic>” or “take <italic>darshan</italic>” (<italic>darshan karna, darshan lena</italic> in Hindi) is a shorthand way of referring to the rite of worship performed before a god image, of which viewing it is the most fundamental step. Indeed, to experience <italic>darshan</italic> can stand alone as a fulfilling act of worship even if the other steps of exchanging offerings (<italic>prasad</italic>) and honoring the deity with light and sound (<italic>aarati</italic>) are not performed or witnessed.<sup>45</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In line with my general emphasis in this essay against meaning, I will downplay constructions of <italic>darshan</italic> as communication in favor of an exchange-based model that I see replicating more closely the attitudes of my Mumbai interlocutors. It conceptualizes the spiritual presence that is one party in the transaction as a subtle emanation that fills the effigy or image, which is thought of as a sort of vessel. The eyes of both parties can be homologized with other orifices that permit the transfer of substances such as food or sexual fluids from one body to another.<sup>46</sup> The connection has been matter-of-factly explained to me in terms of the flow of electricity between terminals.<sup>47</sup> For my consultant in this matter, who lived in a shack and was something of an equal-opportunity visitor to the shrines of different creeds, the question of installation or maintenance by a qualified professional—a ritual specialist, Brahmin or otherwise—to ensure that the public <italic>murti</italic> was switched “on” did not enter the equation. Nor, indeed, did the question of faith or belief. But there is a pleasing symmetry to the idea that, in receiving a recognition perhaps normally withheld an anonymous subaltern in urban space, a desiring subject effectively refills the vessel through his or her own <italic>darshan</italic>-gaze.</p>
         <p>In the course of researching these visual artifacts’ operations in urban space, however, I came to learn that restricting inquiry to what happens when a connection is made with a viewing subject was a limiting approach. More readily observed and of no less importance are the conditions under which these images fail to exert an attraction. What I have in mind is the property that religious images and, by extension, the structures that house them have of protecting the space they occupy against persons who might approach with impious intent. One unequivocally instrumental use of divine imagery is described in one of the great Bombay novels, Rohinton Mistry’s <italic>Such a Long Journey</italic>, in which a wall is painted over with the gods of diverse communities in order to prevent male pedestrians from peeing against it.<sup>48</sup> Such comprehensively ecumenical displays—more commonly installed in the form of commercially printed tiles—adorn much street-fronting property in the city, stating to incontinent passersby of all persuasions: “Sacred Space—Do Not Disturb.” To be sure, the garlands occasionally to be seen draped around such tiles indicate there are some who recognize sublime traces even in imagery put to this humble employment.</p>
         <p>The converse of this pragmatic ecumenicalism can be seen at work in a related practice: that of installing images metonymic of specific religious identities to stake out neighborhood turf. If, for the bourgeois citizens attuned to ignoring them, the displays violate the illusion of the city as the locus of a seamless modernity, subaltern residents may well see in the Ganesh on the overpass or the Catholic cross at the street corner a warning sign: “Sacred Space—Proceed at Own Risk.” And in a related capacity as warders-off of unwelcome attention, the shrines figure as outposts of a seamy subaltern underground in a whole fund of Mumbai middle-class lore. What bourgeois citizens (and, tellingly, the sponsors of rival temples) have to say about what really goes on down the block may go beyond the mere collection of funds to involve gambling or even prostitution, the idea in both cases being that streetside worship provides cover for the anonymous mingling of purveyors of illicit goods and services and their clients. Another allegation, disseminated through Bollywood films such as Ram Gopal Varma’s <italic>Company</italic> (2002) and echoing a trope of India-based adventure narratives running from Hollywood all the way back to the exploits of the medieval Turkic invader Mahmud of Ghazni,<sup>49</sup> is that the structures or the <italic>murti</italic>s themselves are repositories of loot: drug drops, caches of smuggled goods, hoards of ill-gotten cash sequestered from the arm of the law.</p>
         <p>In connection with this partitioning of officially public space among diverse urban enclaves, I nominate three points for further consideration. The first is with the <italic>maha aarati</italic>s, or mass street-based Hindu prayer ceremonies, that were mobilized to bloody effect by the Shiv Sena in the riot-torn winter of 1992–93.<sup>50</sup> The second point is a comparison I hope to expand on in future through further ethnographic research: it is with the boundary gods, or “sentinel deities,” to use Daniel’s term, who guard the approaches to villages in much of rural India. Here I will offer some provisional observations on this aspect of “village religion” in conjunction with the third point, which is the question of how Sai Baba functions as an image and a divine personality within a model of visual signaling that stresses an effect of repulsion.</p>
         <p>“And now, listen carefully,” in the words of the <italic>Satcharita</italic>, “to the narration of how the <italic>darshan</italic> of his mere photograph is the same as his actual <italic>darshan</italic>”:<disp-quote>
               <p>152. Balabua Sutar, the [well-known singer of hymns] from Bombay…once went to Shirdi for Baba’s <italic>darshan</italic>.</p>
               <p>153. This was his very first visit. But…as soon as they looked at each other, Sai very clearly said to him.</p>
               <p>154. “See, I have known him for the last four years!” Balabua naturally, wondered why he was saying so.</p>
               <p>155. “Baba has not left Shirdi and even I have seen Shirdi for the first time, today.…”</p>
               <p>156. As he pondered on it, Bua suddenly remembered that four years ago, he had once made obeisance to Baba’s photograph.…</p>
               <p>158. “I had made obeisance only to the photograph and set eyes on his form, for the first time, today. But Baba recognized me, though I had forgotten all about it, long ago!” he thought.<sup>51</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
Given the sheer number of shrines occupied in the present day by effigies of the bearded old man, to attribute to the Baba the ability to gaze out of each local station is to concede panoptical powers that rival those of that other bewhiskered saint who sees you when you’re sleeping and knows when you’re awake. And of course on streets that are traversed by a diversity of inhabitants, subject to diverse dispensations, it is far from everyone that can be expected to heed—<italic>maanna</italic>—Sai Baba as the master. Indeed, the logic of image-as-agent may well offer a corollary: perhaps Sai Baba’s gaze is not welcoming of all it surveys.</p>
         <p>To be sure, this is an inference that cuts against the basic principle of the saint’s theology, namely, that the Lord of All is One (and I am that Lord). Or, to be more precise: the Lord of All is One (and in my form the Lord is effectively recognizable to All—whatever rival figurations are out there addressing limited subsets of All). But to follow through on the connection I drew above between slum housing for humans and shrine housing for gods, I suggest that for many shrine builders and clients whose outposts mark an alternative, slum-based geography, the flip side of the <italic>darshan</italic>-image’s ideological address is an equally desirable surveillance effect. Boundary zones in the villages many of the settlers of Mumbai shantytowns come from are made visible by the local stations of divine guardians. In other words, what marks the edge of “our” settlement is a shrine. The sentinel deities posted to them are discrete personalities, marked apart spatially and hierarchically from the <italic>gaondevi</italic> worshipped as the village deity. Rural Muslims are no strangers to this sort of cultic activity, as human or as deified participants; in some Hindu communities of the Deccan, for example, the spirit-horseman who patrols the marches is worshipped as a Muslim hero. (What is important, again, is that he’s <italic>our</italic> Muslim hero.)</p>
         <p>It might be thought: The old mendicant is himself a footloose migrant from rural Maharashtra; this makes Sai Baba a logical emblem for slum-colony residents to identify with, perhaps new arrivals from Maharashtra in particular. But I doubt even this basic biographical detail comes into play. In the present day, at all events, the Baba’s mimetic reach is shallower. It is my contention that on this field of contested turf he is often deployed as a sort of placeholder. The saint is a signpost on the border, occupying a mediatory position: legible enough to gain attention from the public—and the neighbors—but not so aggressive as to throw down the gauntlet. It follows that at certain sites the Sai Baba icon must be functioning as a mask. For a given shrine’s client constituency, the agent of surveillance emplaced in the neighborhood shrine may well be a less encompassing quantity than the Lord of All who adorns the surface; the actual resident is a site-specific deity, its sovereignty coterminous with the local community that maintains it in its place. At the same time, this indexical groundedness in no way invalidates the <italic>murti</italic>’s effect as an icon on any members of the public who recognize it as the Baba. Visual operations in this scenario can be conceptualized along three vectors: forward, into the public; backward, into the client community; and sideways, in relation to other spatial markers.</p>

         <title>The Crisis: Municipal Demolitions, Fall 2003</title>
         <p>In the fall of 2003, bowing to the ruling of the Bombay High Court in a suit filed the previous year by the public-interest NGO Janhit Manch, the Municipal Corporation duly undertook citywide demolitions of what were defined in the writ as “illegal religious structures.” The demolition campaign arrived in my neighborhood early on the morning of November 6. From Nepeansea Road, where I lived, past Kemp’s Corner, along Hughes Road, and up to my favorite lunch spot at Chowpatty Beach, the little booths that had lined the streets had been reduced to heaps of rubble.</p>
         <p>It is only to be expected that in Mumbai, where a severely congested built environment is overlaid with an intricate set of official and unofficial rules governing the recognition of tenancy, such a conflict would betray, on both sides, a deep anxiety about access to housing. In addition to appealing to the principles of secularism and the rule of law, the president of Janhit Manch, Bhagvanji Raiani, noted in his petition that “in Mumbai lakhs of people live on the pavements with the blessings of the corporators and the municipal officers at the great hardship and risk to the pedestrians and the vehicular traffic. Hundreds of gods &amp; goddesses have also enrolled as footpath dwellers along with the human Occuptans [<italic>sic</italic>] aggravating the chaotic traffic the Mumbaikars are facing in their daily lives.”<sup>52</sup> Concern for traffic flow is a standard trope in a middle-class discourse of urban development whose project might be theorized as the maintenance of epistemic order against the encroachments of chaotic subaltern elements. Curiously, however—and his sarcasm notwithstanding—I suspect that in his identification of gods and goddesses with human migrants to the city, Raiani may have inadvertently reflected something close to the perspective of his opponents.</p>
         <p>The petition took names and tabulated numbers. No fewer than 758 of the illegal religious structures identified on Municipal Corporation land were listed as Hindu, with forty-four Christian, twenty Muslim, and five Buddhist entries making up the balance. Reporting these figures, the <italic>Times of India</italic> observed that the actual number of unlicensed structures was bound to be far higher than the total given: “The BMC submitted a list of 857 illegal shrines to the high court and it was later updated to 1,430. But a deputy municipal commissioner admitted on condition of anonymity that ‘there are no less than 10,000 illegal shrines in the city.’”<sup>53</sup> There can be little doubt that of the structures classified as Hindu a majority were dedicated to Sai Baba. The tabloid <italic>Mid Day</italic> presented the saint’s popularity as a “conundrum” for the authorities: “Interestingly, many of the illegal structures on the corporation’s list are Sai Baba shrines. While demolition of any shrine invites public opposition, a Sai Baba shrine is especially difficult to touch because people from all communities can be mobilised in its support. Shirdi’s spiritual master is not identified with any particular religion.”<sup>54</sup> As events subsequently proved, the reporter had gotten things exactly backward: Sai Baba’s generic quality had left him—unlike, say, Hanuman or Mary—without a specific constituency to organize politically on his behalf (by contrast, Catholic and Muslim groups were swift to protest, followed belatedly by the Shiv Sena, which enacted a characteristic flip-flop from an initial law-and-order posture to ventilate on behalf of the aggrieved “Hindu community”). But by the same token, it had been the Baba’s neutrality as a metonym of no particular religious community that had enabled his shrines to be erected in a prosperous and diversely populated neighborhood like mine in the first place. Of the illegal religious structures along the route I frequented, every one had been a Sai Baba shrine, and every one encountered a municipal bulldozer.</p>
         <p>As a result of Raiani’s persistence, my lunchtime pilgrimage trail had been erased after the manner of a slum clearance, another skirmish in the endless battle to make the lived streets look the way they do in development plans. The next morning, however, each pile of broken bricks had been repopulated with garlands and miniature, store-bought Sai Baba effigies. The markers gave the impression of having sprouted from the ruins spontaneously, as though the immanent divinity residing at each site could not be suppressed. And indeed, as I observed of Raiani’s language, traces of this indexical logic have a way of surfacing in the rhetoric of the state’s functionaries as well. One official I spoke with at the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority framed the structures as natural growths like weeds or toadstools, subject to a sort of organic ecology that defied rational principles. First you might see a stand offering drinking water, he related. Next a canopy would sprout over the table. Once the growth sent up a flag over the canopy, you would be able to tell from the color—green or saffron—whether what you had on your doorstep was a budding mosque or temple.</p>

         <title>Epilogue: Return to Shirdi?</title>
         <p>At this concluding point, my discussion returns to the Peirceian distinction between indexical and iconic modes of signification. I posit the indexical mode as fundamental to a subaltern spatial imaginary that maps urban neighborhoods on the plan of a village. Within this dispensation city blocks are constituted as habitable, not through certification by the paperwork of the state, but by a higher, if unofficial, imprimatur: the concretized presence of protective spirits. Subtly constituted settlers no less than fleshly ones require housing, and stations are built where such squatter gods have asserted their presence (to leave an unseated spirit to wander is not only an impious act but an invitation to danger).</p>
         <p>Yet the same generic quality that enables Sai Baba to cross over among religious traditions also liberates him from such an indexical commitment to specific locations. As I have argued, the real secret of his ubiquity, unbounded by spatial constraints, has to do with the way he manifests and the form that it takes. What is provocative about Sai Baba’s iconicity lies in the purchase it brings to questions about the iterability and reproducibility of religious symbols. How has the image’s mass-mediated dissemination across the city—a movement contingent on elements of a complex social geography, as sketched in these pages—produced slippages in the symbol’s relation to the space it marks, on the one hand, and to the personality it represents, on the other?</p>
         <p>To address the first question, I would like to propose that the icon’s proliferation helps accomplish a transition between two modes of imagining and experiencing the urban street: from a territorialized space that is monitored by resident gods to a spectacularized space traversed by a viewing public. What I have in mind is not a public sphere for the exchange of rational discourse à la Jürgen Habermas but rather a contested canvas on which the claims of diverse constituencies are marked through the display of religious and other kinds of valorized images. In this scenario, one of the meanings a religious display projects is a bid for public recognition on behalf of the community that owes it allegiance. But in the case of the Sai Baba image the sectarian affiliation is elided, the claim being made on the simultaneously broader and shallower basis of a demarcation of generically or ecumenically (or even, to deploy the term in its Indian sense, <italic>secularly</italic>) sacred space.</p>
         <p>These are both points I have argued in these pages. It will be recalled, however, that of the initial total of 857 illegal structures counted by the Municipal Corporation, all but ninety-nine had been identified as Hindu—a category within which Sai Baba was subsumed. The tabulation points to a problem that has as much to do with the icon’s citation of the formal typology of orthodox Hindu images as with the ambiguous antecedents of the person it represents mimetically. Given the instrumentality of iconic <italic>darshan</italic> imagery to devotional Hinduism’s ascendancy across India in this age of mechanical reproduction, it should be asked whether the course of Sai Baba’s dissemination really has diluted the saturation of public space by the metonyms of a hegemonic Hinduism. Conversely, might not the icon’s proliferation in this field of citational effects perhaps have inaugurated a slippage that reverses the Trojan-horse tendency—converting, in effect, the Baba into a stealth vehicle for the reinscription of Hindu norms? Does the fakir’s beard mask a Brahmin after all?</p>
         <p>I think the answer can cut both ways. A visit to the pilgrimage center at Shirdi confirms the impression that mediation by technologies of mass reproduction has not only divorced his image from his history as a Muslim mystic but also from his place of origin and, effectively, from roots to any other place in particular. So detached has the icon become through constant re-citation from its locally and historically grounded object that here, under the direction of the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust, the cultic center has become thoroughly Brahminized. Priests from local Brahmin families, draped in saffron-colored <italic>dhoti</italic>s, preside at four prayer services (<italic>aarati</italic>s) daily. What might once have been recognizable as a <italic>dargah</italic>, a Muslim holy man’s tomb, has been built over in the idiom of Hindu temple architecture and now stands reconstituted as a <italic>samadhi mandir</italic>. Outside the complex the town consists in the main of hotels for pilgrims, some quite fancy, and a bazaar whose stock in trade takes the form of visual-cultural artifacts—posters, key chains, tote bags, stickers—marked with the figure of Sai Baba. As if to emphasize the indexical disjuncture between these duplicate forms and their place of fictive origin, much of the merchandise is stamped “Made in China.”</p>
         <p>On the other hand, why travel as far as Shirdi? The namesake village of Shirgaon offers a salient advantage over the original—its convenient location by an exit off the Mumbai-Pune expressway. At first glance this equally dusty little community would seem to have little to recommend itself as a pilgrimage site beyond the iconic resemblance of its name to <italic>Shirdi</italic>. But it was there that, sure enough, in the course of delivering an Independence Day speech on August 15, 2002, the local politician Prakash Devale was visited by the Baba and commanded to build an exact replica of the <italic>samadhi mandir</italic>. Devale followed up on the vision with a pilgrimage to Shirdi accompanied by an architect, an engineer, a video camera, and measuring equipment. In visual terms the fidelity of the copy is exact. How many who recognize the Baba in his icon will even notice that, behind their colorful <italic>dhoti</italic>s and sacred threads, the officiating priests at this rival center have been drawn from its Muslim and formerly untouchable Buddhist inhabitants?</p>
