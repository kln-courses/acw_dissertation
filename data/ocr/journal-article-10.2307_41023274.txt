<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE STORIED COLÍN OF KITH Quite recently M. Oxé (of Crefeld) has devoted to the interpre- tation of the reliefs of the storied column of Mayence a long and interesting paper1 which, however, M. Reinach has correc- ted and supplemented in several essential particulars in an article contributed to this Revue 2. M. Oxé has shown that the column which was set up towards the year 66 A. D. by the Canabari of Mayence to the Roman Juppiter for the safety of Nero, constitutes, so to speak, a hymn in honour of the Empire. The Emperor who is thus directly associated with Juppiter Optimus Maximus figures prominently amid the reliefs of the shaft, where he dominates an assemblage of essentially Roman deities, conceived as looking down ben- ignly upon the sacrifice at the altar in front of the Column like- wise dedicated to Juppiter. This splendid allegory of Empire seems, as M. Oxé well remarks; inspired by the spirit of Horace, Odes 1. 12. The monument is as genuinely Roman as if destined to stand on the Roman Capitol, where there actually existed several columns in honour of Juppiter. M. Oxé, in opposition to the current opinion which insists upon the presence on the reliefs of the Column of one or more Celtic gods, has quite well understood that there was no place in this grand Roman Pantheon for mere provincial deities, such, for instance, as Epona or Rosmerta. But in archaeology as elsewhere superstition dies hard : The old dragon underground Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail. No more Eponas and Rosmertas or other Gaulish divinities 1.

Oxé; but as though he repented of his audacity in face of the theories of the Gallo-Roman archaeologists, he suddenly hesitates and develops à propos of three goddesses of the third drum, for whom no satisfactory explanation has so far been discovered, a fascinating but wholly untenable thesis. He sees in them the tres Galliae personified (imitated perhaps from the altar of Roma and Augustus at Lyons), a theory on which we need not dwell further since M. S. Reinach has made short work of it in his article. With his usual perspicacity M. Reinach has perceived that Oxé's tres Galliae are none other than three of the twelve Du Comentes which had as yet -found no place in any of the interpretations of the Column ; namely Venus, repre- sented as Verticordia with her scales, who as ancestress of the Julian race could not fail to be present amid reliefs consecra- ted to the apotheosis of the Imperial idea; Ceres, shown as god- dess of « agriculture and fecundity » with her foot on the head of an ox or cow, and finally Vesta with the ass at her side to betray the fact that this goddess is the « anthropomorphic form » of an ancient ass divinity1. These brilliant interpreta- tions must henceforth be accepted as certain. But M. Reinach too, though he has elsewhere made merry at the expense of those he christens the Kelto-maniacs, has not known how to liberate himself entirely from the Gaulish superstition. For the 4th figure of the third drum M. Oxé had suggested the name of Libera* (though how she could come to carry a cadu~ ceus and an olive branch was not explained). Now what does 1. I fail to see any object in either of the hands of the Ceres distantly resem- bling « une double torche » (Reinach); her left hand holds the sceptre; her right hand the patera. But the uncertain object held by Vesta might be a torch, and indeed seemed to be such when the figure was thrown on the screen at a lecture on the interpretation of the Column which I recently deli- vered at Oxford. 2. The various current interpretations ^exclusive ot M. neinacn s which were not'yeHcnown) will be found conveniently put together in Professor Ernst Neeb's excellent short Führer to the restitution of the Column on the Saalburg : Die Juppiter säule, eine kurze Erklärung ihres Bildschmuckes mit 4 Tafeln (Stutt- gart, s. a.).</page><page sequence="4">324 REVUE ARCHÉOLOGIQUE M. Reinach make out of this doubtful Libera, but turn her into a Rosmerta ! And not content with introducing the gentle little Gaulish goddess into the company of the three great Roman divinities * he actually allows her to appear a second time on the socle of the Column, where he recognizes her, with Kör- ber, in the companion of the Mercury of the relief on the right ' But Oxé has shown that Mercury's companion, with her cadu- ceus and snake, is almost certainly the Romanized official form of Htjgieia, whose presence is required by the pro salute Nero- nis of the inscription. Is it necessary to insist on the fact, well stated by M. Ihm in his article in Roscher's Lexicon, that of the three inscribed representations of Rosmerta, two are negligible because of there fragmentary condition, while on the third, the well-know relief of Eisenberg (Ihm, loe. cit., fig. 1), the goddess has no caduceus, but is represented carrying a vessel of uncertain purport in her left hand and holding a patera in her right. Rosmerta, it is true, is coupled with Mer- cury on countless inscriptions, but this is no reason for sup- posing, as is generally done, that she carried attributes similar to his. For the rest, M. Reinach accepts the interpretations of M. Oxé, including that of Pax for the female divinity in the second row between Honos and Virtus. It is for this so-called Pax (Ceres in Neeb's Führer) that I now wish to propose an alternative interpretation which will, I trust, make clear cer- tain details of interpretation left obscure by MM. Oxé and Rei- nach. There is at first sight a great deal in favour of a sugges- tion that would give us an ancient rendering of « peace with honour », were it not that Pax must be recognized elsewhere in Oxé's doubtful Lidera of the third drum. Peace is here repre- 1. M. Oxé (p. 31) had admirably shown how much out of place would be Epona, for instance, in the company of the genuinely Roman gods of the Column. 2.

She is Tellus or Terra Mater whom we expect to find on reliefs which glorify Rome and the Empire as the source of the blessings of Pax. It has been shown that Pax and Tellus are practically interchangeable in. the minds of the poets of the Augustan era * and the fluidity of the ideas underlying these and similar Roman personifications is well-known *. I admit that Tellus is more usually impersonated as reclining, with children at her side. But the scheme of the reliefs requires a standing figure, and just as M. Oxé saw no difficulty in sugges- ting that the figure might be Pax, though no such representa- tion of Pax is exactly known, we, I think, shall not be far wrong in identifying her with the earth goddess who first and foremost has cause to rejoice in the advent of Peace. ...Tua Caesar aetas Fruges et agris rettuiit uberes. Tellus, so closely associated with Pax, is even more intimate- ly connected with Ceres, who, were we not compelled to recog- nize her, with M. Reinach, in the third drum, might well, as many still think1, be this figure of the second drum with her sceptre ending in a bunch of ears of corn. But Oxé has quite rightly show that this figure must form the centre of the com- position closed at either side by Honos and Virtus, and to give a central place to Ceres would neither be in the spirit of the scheme nor offer so logical a sequence as the one I now pro- 1.

The following scheme in conjunction with the illustrations (fig. 5) will make clear the theology of these reliefs. I have italicized the twelve great gods of the state, the dii consentes, whose number has been so happily completed by M. Reinach. Besides these, we have the two Imperial Lares whose attendance on the Emperor needs no apology ; next to them Bacchus or Liber Pater, absolutely in place here as a god of increase and fertility, the parearos of Ceres in the famous temple of the Aventine. Nor does it seem fanciful to suppose that Liber appears on the same drum as Nero, in compliment to the Emperor not averse doubtless to seeing himself alluded to as the vécç Atóvuaoç1. Of Terra Mater I have already spoken; the remaining figures are all allegorical and this was the age of allegory both in art and literature ' 1. M. Oxé, likewise, turns this dram roud so as to bring Victoria into the centre line. She is flanked by Mars and by Neptune respectively impersona- ting, as Oxé indicates, the Roman army and the Roman fleet. It needs no argument to demonstrate the superiority of this arrangement over that adopted in the Mainz Museum which places Neptune in the centre. 2. In Nero s portraiture too, with the upturned eyes and exalted expression, we seem to detect the desire to imitate Alexander; of course. I cannot accept M. Oxé's statement (p. 29) that Bacchus has no connexion with the Imperial group. In corroberation of my view I may add that, according to Fräulein Margarete ßieber, the figure facing the enthroned Dionysos on the extreme right of one relief of the stage of Phaedrus in the Theatre of Athens, is Nero, flanked here by two female divinities similar in character to Salus and Fortuna. I am indebted to Miss Bieber for permission to mention her still unpublished theory which she developed at a meeting of the German Institute of Rome in the spring of 1913. 3. I throw into a note a few observations on certain other figures. The divi- nities of the socle and pedestal are more specially concerned with the welfare of the Emperor ; besides Salus and Fortuna, we have the Dioscuri, originally divinities of healing and the allies of Rome at Lake Regillus, whose temple in the Forum had been splendidly restored under Augustus (A. D. 6); and Apollo, to whom also as « Healer .» was dedicated his earliest temple in Rome, the special patron of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian house. The Hercules of the socle is not present here as « reveller » (Neeb. Führer) but holds the cup of</page><page sequence="8">328 REVUE ARCHÉOLOGIQUE Jam Fides, et Pax, et Bonos Pudorque Priscus, et neglecta redire Virtus Audet ; apparetque beata pieno Copia cornu. (Horace, Carm. Saec, 57-60.) The reliefs of the Column take us full into the tradition of the Ara Pacts Augustae of the year B. C. 13, which, as we know nectar as Hercules Victor, in token of his admission among the Olympians after bis labours. He is not here, however, as the « young intruder into Olympus, who must need be satisfied with the worst place at the back, and who would scarcely find any Olympian ready to exchange with him » (Oxé). A place is assigned him here with the great Olympians because, his cult, altough of foreign origin, became in time essentially Roman. Hercules is no worse placed than Apollo, the great god of the Augustan house. Augur et fulgente de cor us ar cu Phoebus or than another great Olympian, Apollo's own Sister Diana, placed by Oxé and by me at the back of the Column. One difficult question of interpretation remains in the heads of the two Satyrs with pcinted ears within the frame, at the top, to the right and left of the Juppiter, and in the two faces or masks of Silenus in the same position on either side of the Heracles. To see in the former, as Neeb inclines to (Führer, p. 7) the portrait of the artists (why with pointed ears ?) seems quite unreasonable. I may here note for the convenience of the readers of the Revue that Dr Quil- ling, in two articles which are known to me only through the reference to them injthe Führer, interprets Honos and Virtus as Roma deletamdRoma ras- tiluta respectively, and considers the Column to have been put up to com- memorate Nero's escape from the Pisonian conspiracy of the year 65 and his restoration of the City destroyed in the fire of 64. Quilling accepts as Ceres (with Körber and others) the female figure between Honos and Vir- tus, and sees in her the direct allusion to Nero's corn largesses to those who had been sufferers through the fire. The flames that issued from the sceptre of Vulcan (second drum) represent, according to Quilling, the destruc- tive fire. He further tries to improve on Oxé's Galliae tres by arguing that Keltic and Germanic mingle here with Graeco-Roman conceptions ; he sees, in the three figures, the three Fates : « the Parca Itala with the ox-head (vitulus- Vitellia- Italia, the land of Oxen), the Parca Germana (the Norn with her pro- phetic horse), and the Parca Gallica, with her scales, the attribute of the mint goddess (Lyons, the Gaulish capital and the most important mint of the Empire)». The figure which I interpret Pax and which Oxé thought might be Libera, Quilling considered to be Felicitas bringing prosperity to the Empire and its commerce. Felicitas is a happier idea than either Rosmerta or Epona, but the rest of Dr Quilling's thesis is perhaps best dismissed without com- ment.</page><page sequence="9">ON THE STORIED COLUMN OF MAYENCE 329 from his coinage, Nero made his special care1. The spirit that informs the reliefs of the one and the other monument is the same. It is Peace with all her attendant blessings encouraged by the Imperial rule and waited upon by the gods of Rome. We are reminded not only of the Ara but of other Augustan monuments also. For instance, Juno who on the topmost drum personifies the heavens whose boundaries are indicated by Sol and Luna, is conceived in the same spirit as the Caelus on the breastplate of the Augustus from Prima Porta, while Sol and Luna have a further significance as tutelary divinities of agri- culture*. The glorification of Pax, so grandly inaugurated in art by Augustus, did not decline under his successors. Its crowning manifestation was to be the Forum et Templum Pads of Nero's successor Vespasian ; of its vitality in the Neronian age, we have as splendid a record on the Juppiter Column of Mayence as though like the Augustan Ara it were dedicated to Peace herself. The restitution on the Saalburg must make the Column bet- er known, and at the same time lead to the clearer understand- ing of the ideas expressed in its sculpture. I shall be happy if these notes can take us a step further on the path opened out by M. Oxé's fine paper3. The Juppiter Column of Mayence is purely Imperial in its purport; it shows that the Roman cities 1. Nine examples of these coins are given by Petersen, Ara Pads Augustae fig. 60. In the year 66, about the date, that is, of the Column of Mayence, the Arval brothers offered a cow to Pax (Faci Vaccam; see Wissowa, loc. cit.). On the cult of Pax and kindred cults (Salus, Providentia, etc.), see the excellent remark of Kubitschek quoted by Petersen op. cit., p. 196. 2. Cf.

If the sculptures of the column are viewed dispassiona- tely, we shall feei them to represent the natural expansion ol the Imperial idea. No one now would, I imagine, seriously suppose with Eckhel (Doctrina nummo- rum VI, 268 f., on the Neronian coins with the Ara Pads) that Nero encoura- ged peace merely that he might the better have time to indulge his evil pas- sions.</page><page sequence="10">L. tide.
