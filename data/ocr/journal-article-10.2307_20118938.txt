<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERESY AS MOTIF IN THE SHORT STORIES OF BORGES For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts. Isaiah 55:8,9. As early as 1930, heresy and its resultant frustrations occupy prominent position in the prose of Jorge Luis Borges. By 1936, in the essay "Circular Time," Borges is talking of heresy, heresio logy, heresiarchs, and the human consequences of such doctrines and beliefs. From his most brilliant decade, the 1940's, to his most recent fiction, El congreso [The Assembly], 1971, heresy is a constant motif, a basic recurring element which grants thematic unity to his extensive collection of short stories. As here defined, heresy is defiling, challenging or opposing that which is considered sacred or divine. In the limited context of Christianity such heresies as salvation through knowledge alone (Gnosticism) or the affirmation that Christ was merely an inspired man and not a God (Christology) are already well known. Yet Borges goes much beyond Christianity in discovering heresies and explores its many facets in a universal setting. Not only does he base his prose on creeds and countercreeds or world religions, he also delves into sacred personal beliefs and venerable national myths. He does not avail himself of heresy to denounce or criticize religion but rather as a literary device to expand his created world, to reveal basic themes of life and existence. No specific religion, sect or dogma comes under direct fire in the author's prose; he is a universalist, not confined to one historical time or place. Judaism, and especially the mystery-delv ing Kabbalists,1 most often provides ideological bases ("Death 1 See Jaime Alazraki's "Borges and the Kabbalah,'' TriQuarterly 25, Prose for</page><page sequence="2">24 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW and the Compass," "The Aleph," "The Theologians" and the poem "The Golem"). Islam, Hinduism and certain Eastern religions rank second in the canon of organized religions serving as inspiration for writings on heresy ("The Circular Ruins," "The Two Kings and the Two Labyrinths," "The Garden of Forking Paths," etc.). Christianity and its multiple doctrines follow ? "The Gospel According to Mark," "Three Versions of Judas," El congreso, etc. In "The God's Script" Borges even uses the back drop of ancient Mayan belief although the ideas are based on the Kabbalah and the resultant mixture comes out a heretical hybrid of philosophy and religion. The creeds of these religions offer the metaphysical elements which may assist in explaining the complex universe, a constant yearning among Borgesian characters. The Heresy of Philosophy Borges frequently refers to "God" and to the "divine," but seldom makes qualitative remarks regarding what god, or which divinity. His works present a god that simply "is"; Borges rarely evokes traditional religious notions of god but instead makes re ference to an infinite, unconditional, and indefinable deity, a god whose presence pervades the universe, one who created all, Tillich's god, the "ground of being." Certainly Borges is not alluding to an anthropomorphic deity, nor to any type of god that can be limited or conditioned, for as he asserts, "we would distrust the intelligence of a God who maintains heavens and hells. God does not hate and does not love anyone."2 Without trying to form a complete analysis of Borges' complex theology, it is here sufficient to recognize that his prose assumes a "divine presence"; most of his works exude such a being. What exactly he conceives that presence to be he does not prescribe, considering it an impossible task to approach god through words or rituals. For Borges to describe the god(s) hovering above nearly every story would be tantamount to personal heresy. It is likewise heretical to think that the universe can be explained in terms of a philosophy or a theology. Definitions, words and theories are insufficient expressions of the true nature and meaning of the intricate universe. As Borges has expressed, "it is hazardous to think that a coordination of words (philosoph ies are nothing else) can have much resemblance to the universe."3 Borges.

In numerous stories Borges represents the universe as an intri cate maze, and even suggests that "God" created the world in that confusing manner for a specific purpose. However, it is not necessary for man to understand that purpose, and further it is an act of heresy to try to approach the mind of god, which man does when he attempts to discover purposes. In presenting the universe as a labyrinth, Borges suggests that the world is an enormous, complex drama. In this drama each event is a key part of the total, each individual action is integral to the universal act, and each man is "performing a secret drama determined and pre meditated by God." Thus, "the history of the universe ? and our lives and the most trifling detail of our lives ? has an unconjec turable, symbolic meaning" (0.7., 125). Each act is universal; man must comply with the requisites of the complete universal production. Since those requisites have been framed by god, it is not for man to discover them but rather to act out the total scheme. The universe, therefore, appears as a labyrinth to the human mind; man will never fully understand its processes nor its meanings. Despite this position in the scheme, man, by his very nature, is destined to try to order his world and thus the concept of heresy is built into Borges' labyrinthal universe. Many of his characters are active personages who are not content to sit back and perform their part of an existence which seems meaningless. Even at the risk of committing heresy, they struggle with the meaning of the world around them and their place in history, despite the futility of ever perceiving the order for which they search. Indeed, the very act of heresy is essential for Borges' characters to achieve their full humanity; if they remain passive and avoid the struggle for meaning they will certainly not fall into heresy but neither will they ever reach full stature. Searching for order and perspective in life and death, Borgesian characters formulate philosophies and theologies that attempt to explain the unseen and the seen. Thus, philosophy becomes heresy, for as man attempts to order the universe and reason out his existence, he meddles with the divine. In this struggle man frequently winds up inventing realities that are more logical and easier to accept than the actual world. In "Tl?n, Uqbar, Orb is Tertius" a group of intellectuals invents a completely separate world, with the result that in the end this alien reality supplants the realities of the present:</page><page sequence="4">26 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW How could one do other than submit to Tl?n, to the minute and vast evidence of an orderly planet? It is useless to answer that reality is also orderly. Perhaps it is, but in accordance with divine laws ? I translate: inhuman laws ? which we never quite grasp. Tl?n is surely a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth devised by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men (Labyrinths, 17,18). In "The God's Script" Borges suggests what might happen were man to somehow stumble upon the secret meaning of the universe. Tzinac?n posits that from the beginning, god saw the end and wrote a coded message, one that would give its user unlimited power. As the last priest in his known world, Tzinac?n expects this privilege and commences his search for the secret and sacred symbol that will unlock divine knowledge and power. After considering and eliminating thousands of possibilities, he postulates that the coded message is inscribed on the skin of the jaguar. Deciphering the meaning and formulating it into words occupies uncounted years but like a successful Kabbalist, Tzinac?n envisions a giant wheel, a type of "Aleph," that unites all time and space, the entire universe. However he wisely realizes that he could never reveal this personal secret, to do so would amount to betrayal and heresy, giving him power over god's creations. Such power would alter his existence, making him a god rather than the prisoner he really is: May the mystery lettered on the tigers die with me. Whoever has seen the universe, whoever has ^beheld the fiery designs of the universe, cannot think in terms of one man, of that man's trivial fortunes or misfortunes, though he be that very man. That man has been he and now matters no more to him. What is the life ofthat other to him, the nation of that other to him, if he now, is no one. This is why I do not pro nounce the formula, why, lying here in the darkness, I let the days obliterate me (Labyrinths, 173). Tzinac?n realizes that it is impossible for finite man to decipher and control the universe, for in the hypothetical instant in which he might, he would lose his identity and become infinite. And in Borges, even the thought of approaching the infinite is traumatic, as seen in "Averroes' Search": "The fear of the crassly infinite, of mere space, of mere matter, touched Averroes for an instant. He looked at the symmetrical garden; he felt aged, useless, unreal" (Labyrinths, 152). Clearly, the infinite, the divine realm, is not intended for man, yet still he searches for its key. It is thus that he turns to philosophy, and it is thus that in</page><page sequence="5">HERESY AS MOTIF IN THE SHORT STORIES OF BORGES 27 "the history of philosophy are doctrines, probably false, that exercise an obscure charm on human imagination" (O.I., 37). Borges' characters invariably strive for the meaning of their existence through diverse methods; one is no more valid than another; all lead to some type of frustration. Borges has added a distinct flavor to the existentialist tradition of the Twentieth Century, although*he by no means could be classified solely an existentialist. He asserts that: "Pondering the incalculable and enigmatic nature of reality, I do not believe that the simple symmetry of... human classifications would be sufficient to ex plain reality; such calculations (of man) are little more than hollow mathematical flattery."4 This metaphysical skepticism affirms that if there is order in existence, that order is not accessible to man. Rejecting philosophical idealism, Borgesian fiction emphasizes the failure of philosophical theories to ade quately represent the realities of the world and universe. Indeed, as these philosophies boldly attempt to interpret reality, they not only fail as theories but also enter the realm of heresy. As Borges himself succinctly states: There is no classification of the universe that is not arbitrary and conjectural. The reason is very simple: we do not know what the universe is... We must go even further; we must suspect that there is no universe in the organic, unifying sense inherent in that ambitious word. If there is, we must conjecture its purpose; we must conjecture the words, the definitions, the etymologies, the synonymies of God's secret dictionary (O.I., 104). As a result of the impossibility of penetrating the divine scheme, human theories which attempt to bring order and understanding are both provisional and heretical. Heresy As the Usurpation of Divine Power As already stated, the Borgesian universe is labyrinthal, a maze fashioned by the unfathomable mind of divinity, destined to remain eternally indecipherable to man. Scharlach states ("Death and the Compass"): "I felt that the world was a labyrinth, from which it was impossible to flee" (Labyrinths, 85). As already seen, Borges' view of existence necessitates a belief in the divine, although he does not attempt to define or delimit this deity, for to do so would be a form of heresy. Rather, Borges 4 Discusi?n. Buenos Aires, Emec?, 1966, p. 40. Translation is ours.</page><page sequence="6">28 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW attempts to accede to divine power, so perfectly demonstrated in "The Library of Babel": "Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways..., can only be the work of a god" (Labyrinths, 52). This god, or gods, whom man cannof question or com prehend, has created an ordered chaos of the cosmos wherein man must wander constantly yet unsuccessfully, endeavoring to deci pher the supreme puzzle. This universe does not preclude use of man's inherent intelligence, though to attempt to unravel the labyrinth of the universe is not within his jurisdiction and con stitutes usurpation of the powers of deity: "We don't know the designs of the universe but to think clearly and do good helps these designs, which will never be made known to us" (O.I., 49). The heresy of imitating god's attributes, a challenge to that which is considered divine, is an integral part of the heresy in Borges' framework of the world. His protagonists, regardless of time and circumstance, again and again outstep their mortal limits, seeking either to disentangle their personal enigmas or to structure their own labyrinths, all courses of action which bear serious consequences. Life, Borges suggests, is a riddle, an intri cate puzzle with ever-changing rules that man must accept with flexibility or break himself trying to solve. And yet, with all its confusion, life for Borges is still more preferable than the immor tal state of deity. An analysis of several short stories demonstrates the pervasiveness of this theme of divine imitation, surfacing in much of fiction. The contrast between "Death and the Compass" and "Story of the Warrior and the Captive" offers insight into the Borgesian concept of heresy. L?nnrot, in the first story, fancies himself "a pure reasoner," and uses his intelligence to unravel a maze of mystery and murder. He has supreme confidence in his rational ability to decipher the name of God and to thus discover the assassin. But reason is a tool of man, and L?nnrot, the smug heretic, discovers all too readily the fallacy of reasoning which leads him to the solution of the maze and to his simultaneous destruction. Droctulft, the barbarian, and the Englishwoman savage of "Story of the Warrior and the Captive" provide the direct antithesis to L?nnrot. The warrior willingly abandons his own army during a seige against an intricate and advanced city to fight and die for a complex labyrinth of civilization he will never be able to understand: "He knows that in it (the city) he will be a dog, or a child, and that he will not even begin to understand it, but he also knows that it is worth more than his gods and his sworn faith and all the marshes of Germany" (Labyrinths, 128).</page><page sequence="7">HERESY AS MOTIF IN THE SHORT STORIES OF BORGES 29 The blond captive woman, conversely, chooses the life of bar barism, and contentedly drinks animal blood to indicate her isolation from that same civilization for which Droctulft gives his life. Although directly opposite in action, the warrior and the captive are similar in method, never attempting to decipher the complexities and confusion of their lives but instead yielding to "a secret impulse, an impulse more profound than reason, and both heeded this impulse, which they would not have known how to justify" (Labyrinths, 131). Both accept the insoluble labyrinth of life, leaving inviolate the powers of deity, and finding hap piness therein. One of the most sacrosanct attributes of divine intelligence is the power of creation. In "The Circular Ruins" and "Tl?n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" this power is usurped by man, as the stranger in the first story shaped from his dreams a living son, the most arduous and heretical task that man can conceive. Never theless, the dreamed creation could not be interpolated into rea lity until the multiple gods of the temple granted the magical gift of life. The creation of an entire planet is the purpose of a secret society in "Tl?n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," on the condition that the association, under the direction of an eccentric American million aire, Ezra Buckley, make no pact or covenant with Jesus Christ. This heresy, the rejection of divine assistance in a project requir ing the usurpation of divine powers, evokes a delightful Borgesian comment. "Buckley did not believe in God, but he wanted to demonstrate to this nonexistent God that mortal man was capable of conceiving a world. Buckley was poisoned in Baton Rouge in 1828..." (Labyrinths, 15). In this rapid juxtaposition of time and space (suggesting perhaps cause-and-effect), the heretic is re warded. To decipher a god's identity and his writings is likewise heresy, for man does not have that power; to do so he must intrude on divine right. In "The God's Script" Tzinac?n struggles to find the secret writings in order to take upon himself the powers of God. A similar heresy is performed in "Three Versions of Judas" wherein Runeberg postulates that Judas is the actual embodiment of God; to complete Christ's glorious purpose, there was a need for betrayal, and so God fulfilled the plan and selected the vilest destiny of all, to be the betrayer Judas. As the mortal Savior/traitor, he voluntarily selected hell because hap piness is also a divine attribute denied to man. And for the heretic Runeburg, who blasphemiously divulges the terrible secret of identity, the future holds only suffering and death. A variation on man's usurpation of the divine is found in "The Secret Miracle." A Jew sentenced to death by the Third Reich is apparently able to suspend chronological time, a power</page><page sequence="8">30 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW which man does not actually possess, after asking for god's inter vention. The assistance is given only after he discovers god by chance, randomly and not rationally, as "one of the letters on one of the pages of one of the four hundred thousand volumes of the Clementine," after which his request for an additional year to finish his literary labors is granted. In Hladik's mind, a year does transpire between the final command for execution and moment of his death, although in actuality he dies at the set hour. The con demned finishes his work within the maze of his mind and thus justifies his entire existence. The heresy inherent in such an attempt to control time is mitigated by Hladik's supplications to the divine mind, and his reliance on impulse and chance to guide his plea. An actual physical labyrinth is created by the King of Babylon in "The Two Kings and Their Two Labyrinths." This imitation of the divine design of the universe is scandalous "for confusion and marvels belong to God alone and not to man." In "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," Ryan solves the maze of history, an integral part of the divine power to order time, only to lose all desire to make known the solution, similar to the aforementioned Tzinac?n. The Nazi zur Linde, condemned to death in "Deutsches Requiem," perceives in his final moments the circular labyrinth of life that time and divinity have shaped for men and nations. In the defeat of Hitler and Germany, zur Linde finds happiness, not because he seeks punishment nor because he realizes that to deplore a part of the scheme of the universe is to blaspheme god, rather, he glimpses the totality of the maze, the "secret conti nuity" of the world, and perceives in the fall of the Third Reich the perfected destiny of Germany. In the divine plan it matters neither who the victims nor the victorious are, as long as the circle is complete and the necessary results prevail. Zur Linde avoids heresy because he recognizes and accepts man's inability to order the labyrinth of the universe, and consequently, finds peace in this knowledge. In "The Gospel According to Mark," man takes upon himself a divine role, and later he must of necessity bear the immediate consequences of playing Christ. This heresiarch, Espi nosa, attempts to solve the enigma of the Gutres by placing himself as the supreme intelligence, the source ?f all knowledge; later he receives the same fate as Christ. Emma Zunz takes upon herself the role of avenger in the death of her father, a role normally reserved for divine justice only. And even though she sees the fulfillment of the her vengeance, she finds no satisfaction in that fulfillment. A novel twist to the concept of heresy is man's attempt to limit and order the paths of the labyrinth of life leading to the</page><page sequence="9">HERESY AS MOTIF IN THE SHORT STORIES OF BORGES 31 supreme essence. For in man's attempt to reach the divine, to define the orthodox and heretical through the establishment of religious dogma, the usurpation of sacred rights occurs, so pos tulated in "The Theologians," where two rivals, Aureliano and Juan de Panonia, expend their lives in the refutation of various heresies, attempting always to beat the other in the rational treatises they present. Irony, a common Borgesian tool, succinctly appears in the use of Juan's successful refutation of the heresy of circular time as the decisive factor in his conviction for heretical opinions. That two directly opposed philosophies could both be branded as heresy points to the absurdity of man's endeavor to define religion and orthodoxy. In a short essay entitled "A Prayer" Borges again expresses his belief in an unfathomable universe designed by a supreme intelligence. However, he concludes with a plea to "die comple tely," to die with his body, his constant mortal companion. This heresy, the desire to remain mortal, also is manifest throughout Borges' other literary works. His preference for man's confused wanderings in the universal labyrinth of immortal existence is shown in "Funes." Through a chance accident Ireneo receives a perfect memory, another divine attribute usually denied man. It is the acquisition of this immortal power that makes Funes appear "as monumental as bronze, more ancient than Egypt, prior to the prophecies and pyramids" although in actuality he is only 19. But a perfect memory becomes a form of hell because each recollec tion of the past is an exact duplicate, requiring the same amount of time as the original experience. Sleep is an extreme difficulty and "forgetting differences, generalizing, abstracting," an im possibility. Such an existence expanded infinitely into immortal ity bothers Borges, as witnessed in the lucid story "The Immor tal." Here a tribune of a Roman legion seeks for immortality, only to find its manifestation in the irrational gods who have created the labyrinth that man calls life. These divine intelligences are described as naked, barbaric troglodytes who must exist with the terrible knowledge of their own immortality. Indifferent, be cause all things happen to those who live forever, unpitying, the immortals live in a total world of thought, never speaking, moving, nor in reality living. Nothing holds any value because nothing is unique and will not happen over and over again. An existence equatable to hell, the ultimate search of the immortals becomes one for the river that can again grant mortality and death. Thus, Borgesian man exists in a labyrinth he can neither understand nor control. Neither can he define nor duplicate the supreme powers that fashioned it. Life is neither orderer nor rational, and man cannot make it so. To strive for such an impos</page><page sequence="10">32 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW sibility, to seek to unravel the eternal enigma, is to defile and challenge the sacred, to commit heresy. This recurring motif throughout Borges' works, in all its infinite variations, stems from the same basic root, the usurpation of divine power by man. Whether the heretic tries to unveil the name of god or assumes the actual power of creation, he violates the maze of mortality by attempting to imitate the attributes of a deity who reigns in seeming confusion and chaos. In such a maze, man mustvwander and be content to accept the whims and caprices of the labyrinth's creators, recognizing that life's only peace lies in the knowledge of self limitation. Heresy and Humor The concept of heresy hardly seems the place to find humor; indeed the Bible, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Salem witch trials are full of accounts testifying to the serious nature and severity of punishment for those accused, convicted or even suspected of heresy. The history of the world contains numerous instances of injustices performed in the name of protecting society from what at the time was deemed heretical behavior. Yet through Borges' skeptical intellect and ability to see the world with new light, the possibility of subdued laugther does exist. Humor in heresy rarely produces belly-splitting guffaws; neither is it explicit in the story. As an element of audience involvement, the reader must mentally carry the story to conclusion, wherein he may discover elements of wit and humor. In this fashion the reader is placed in a position superior to the story and enjoys the advantage of chuckling at human foible; such humor usually arises from the final disposition of major characters. L?nrott's extermination is more comic than tragic; by delving into mysteries he weaves his own death web. Pierre Menard's heretical attempts to be Cervantes and re-write his works evoke an ironical humor unparalleled in Latin American literature. Funes achieves near omniscience through perfect memory but in so doing destroys himself. The dreamer ("The Secret Miracle") creates man in his own image but is mockingly denied the crowning achievement of death and is hopelessly condemned to immortality. The most obvious element of humor confronting the reader is satire, wherein Borges turns from his philosophical concepts of the universe to reconcile himself with the mundane and somewhat artificial complexities of the life that surrounds. Overtly conscious of the frailty of man-made institutions, Borges seeks through laughter not so much to tear them down as to inspire their reexamination or renovation.</page><page sequence="11">HERESY AS MOTIF IN THE SHORT STORIES OF BORGES 33 "Ibn Hakkan al-Bokhari, Dead in His Labyrinth," evokes such revision. The heresy in this work (building an unsolvable labyrinth), is also an element of humor, for in recounting the story, it becomes obvious that while attempting to clarify the circumstances surrounding King Zaid, the two intellectuals wind up hopelessly muddling the whole affair. Borges' dramatic blend ing of satire with overstatement, is comparable to a small child possessed of an over-grown imagination. Upon further interroga tion the child supplies necessary facts (Borges even supplies false historical data) which are very clear and distinguishable to him but which leave the listener completely perplexed. Borges em ploys this technique of parody and humor in heresy to further develop his well-known theme of the ambiguity of reality and the false importance man has placed on "information."5 Borges has observed that "when I wrote 'Ibn Hakkan' it became a cross between a permissible detective story and a caricature of one. The more I worked on it... the stronger my need to parody. What I ended up with I hope will be read for its humor."6 By contrast, "The Immortals" employs a humor based on understatement. Commenting on this work Borges admits: "Bioy and I had invented a new way of telling gruesome and uncanny tales. It lay in understanding the grimness and essential horror while playing up certain humorous aspects ? a kind of graft between Alfred Hitchcock and the Marx Brothers."7 Heresy here pokes fun at the commercial sale of immortality, an immortality so estranged from its usual context that it becomes revolting and undesirable. The element of horror, the desired effect in the story, is emphasized by the use of a heretical theme combined with humorous understatement. The highlight of humor is the used car-salesman jargon directed at the successful marketing of a grotesque "immortality." Borges himself, the unashamed creator of new, deity-challeng ing literary worlds, may also be considered a heresiarch; he would take delight in such a classification. Humor in his works serves to extend and expand the results of heresy; laughter and smiles in this very serious world compound the effects of defiling the sacred. By telling a story with diverse possibilities Borges calls attention to the vain importance that man has placed on certain artificial "truths." As previously noted, humor may arise through 5 In private conversations with the authors as well as in recent interviews, Borges has commented on the contemporary world: "We frequently abandon wisdom for knowledge, and too often, knowledge for mere information, the accumulation of data." 6 "Commentaries," The Aleph and Other Stories, 1933-1969. New York, Dutton, 1970, p. 274. 7 Ibid, p. 279.</page><page sequence="12">34 LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW reader afterthought, rather than the intrinsic situation of the story. One of Borges' greatest concerns is to cause man to recognize the folly of his present existence, of times through humorous exposi tion of life and the human condition. The Heretical Character Challenging the structure of the universe, competing with God by fashioning artificial labyrinths, attempting to control time, or even creating a golem-being, Borges' heretics end in frustration and death. No one is allowed to enjoy the fullness of realization; for to do so would place him above the "divine" that seems to gently hover over the author's prose. Yet no one is censured by moralistic divinity nor burned in the fires of the Inquisition; the heretic himself works out his own punishment, usually through the realization of his inability to control forces already in progress. For some it is immediate death: L?nrott deciphers the Kabbalistic labyrinth only to trap himself before his killer's gun; Villari ("The Waiting") unsuccessfully attempts to dream away reality as well as his killers. Others drag themselves through the drawn-out process of impending death, unable to alter the future any longer: Hladik ("The Secret Miracle") completes his mental drama, triggering his own death bullets; the king of Babylon stumbles alone through the choking desert, a slow agonizing death. The creator of a dreamed off-spring seeks the crown and freedom of death only to realize, an echo of old Gnostic belief, that he too is only dreamed and hence frustratingly condemned to immortality. The heretical knowledge that an Aleph (concen tration of all time and space into one point) does exist only frustrates and saddens the protagonist. Tzinac?n finally unravels the labyrinthal mysteries on the jaguar's skin but cannot act on his knowledge. The realization of help-lessness and the inability to modify existence are the most characteristic frustrations: "drunk with insomnia and vertiginous dialectic, Nils Runeberg wandered through the streets of Malm?, begging at the top of his voice that he might be granted the grace of joining his Redeemer in Hell" ("Three Versions of Judas," Labyrinths, 100); he soon dies ignominiously, victim of a heart attack. Intellectual heresy, as practised by Borges' creation, is a lonely occupation. Shutting himself off from others the heretic is left alone to ply his trade: Abenjac?n hides in a crimson labyrinth of his own making; Dahlmann ("The South"), seeking to control the manner in which he dies, ends his life in a dingy hospital room (or on a lonely plain); Tzinac?n exhausts life in a dungeon pit. Runeberg's dissenting writings cut him off from all possible</page><page sequence="13">HERESY AS MOTIF IN THE SHORT STORIES OF BORGES 35 communication with others. Yet despite their forced isolation, the reader perceives that these characters are the real "heroes" of Borges' created worlds. They have chosen to not accept the divine scheme, rather to delve into exciting mysteries, to attempt to exert control over the future, to order an apparent chaos. They are the Doers, the Makers, Borges, "el hacedor," not content with the world of darkness that settles around them. Yet their discon tent leads only to frustration and death and as the narrator of "The Two Kings and Their Two Labyrinths" tersely concludes, "Glory to Him who lives forever." Heresy in Borges does more than merely provide an innovative literary base; its functions are broader than simply creating humor. For Borges heresy serves to elucidate the essence of being. Man has a dualistic, oxymoronic nature; his inner contradictions may at one time deny all that he has previously held sacred and complete. Man is both hero and traitor, creator and dreamed creation, Christ and Judas, savage and civilized, friend and assassin; prisoner and priest. Heretical belief and practice de monstrate the non-static nature of man's existence, his inherent contradictions. Borges uses heresy to challenge rigid belief. Heresy implies an a priori system of ideas and concepts that are true inscrutable realities; Borges defies anything so precise and closed. The past, life, a library, a book, man's mind, time, and the universe have all been symbolically represented by the author as a labyr inth. Anyone who pits his own wit or wisdom against the labyrinth ends in frustration. Yet these labyrinth-challengers are the author's true and tragic heroes, fighting against an uncon trollable destiny larger than themselves.
