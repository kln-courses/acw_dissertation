<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. F. Bynum, E. J. Browne, and Roy Porter, eds., Dictionary of the History of Science (London: Macmillan, and Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981), xxxiv + 494 pp., illus., $40.00, ?17.50. In this volume we have the culmination of a major collaborative effort among historians and philosophers of science. Organized and supervised by three principal editors, with ten subject editors and nearly a hundred contributors, the Dictionary includes 700 articles, covering all of the major areas of science, plus historiography, sociology of science, and philosophy of science. Most of the articles relating to the life sciences are categorized as Biology, Earth Sciences, Human Sciences, or Medicine. The entries themselves, alphabetically arranged, are concepts, such as archetype, natural theology, or contagion; each article is intended to give an explanation and historical sketch of the concept as it has figured in the development of science, particularly in the Westem world. Yet each article is not a separate entity, for extensive cross-refer- encing leads one into a whole network of interlocking ideas. For instance, the entry on natural selection indicates (by asterisks placed next to key words) that one should consult the articles on evolution, species, adaptation, Nature, neo-Darwinism, and neo-Lamarckism; and one is also referred to anthropomorphism in science and to metaphor in science. The article on species sends one as well to morphology, reproduction, time, and genetics. Major articles, such as those on species or evolution, include a brief bibliography of related literature. Many entries simply refer to relevant articles, allowing one several entry points into the subject area of interest. The content is equally impressive. "Species," for example, begins with the seventeenth-century species concept of John Ray, discusses the views of Linnaeus and Buffon in the eighteenth century and of Lamarck and Darwin in the nineteenth, and concludes with the views of Lankester, Poulton, Jordan, Dobzhansky, Ford, and Mayr. 178</page><page sequence="2">The J. H. B. Bookshelf There are several helpful aids, such as a list of the articles by major category (Biology, for example); a bibliography of reference works, general histories of science, and major works in each of the subject categories; and a biographical index that lists each article in which an individual is mentioned. The magnitude of the project has led, predictably, to some unevenness in quality, as well as to some differ- ences among entries in the period of emphasis, with the nineteenth and twentieth centuries receiving the most coverage. Yet the volume should be extremely useful, both to scholars and to students. It is a fine example of what collaborative efforts at their best can produce. S.A.R.</page></plain_text>
