IN this series of studies of the attributes of Divine omniscience in a variety of cultures, admirably translated by Professor H. J. Rose, the researches of Professor Pattazzoni for the last forty years are brought together in a volume which cannot fail to be of very considerable interest for students of the history of religion, anthropologists and folklorists. The investigation covers a wide field ranging from Ancient Egypt and Babylonia, Greece and Rome, to China and the Pacific, Africa and America, the Celts, the Slavs and the Finno-Ugrians. Starting from the assumption that religion is an aspect of culture, organically related to the culture in which it arises and functions, omnis- cience in the concept of Deity is interpreted as the result of gods being all-seeing because they are luminous Sky-beings. " The manner in which Divine omniscience comes about is quite definite," it is asserted, " for it is founded upon a power of universal vision, completed on occasion by similar powers of hearing, by omnipresence and the like." Therefore, the belief arose in an anthropomorphic context rather than in a primeval monotheistic conception of "a ratiocination looking for a cause ", as Wilhelm Schmidt maintained. While it is true that it has often " taken different shapes including at times diverse attributes, according to the cultural environment in which it appears ", the Sky-god cannot be as sharply contrasted with the Earth-goddess as is here suggested, the one arising, as it is alleged, in a hunting state of culture, and the other under agricultural conditions, since the two are frequently so very intimately related, as folklorists in particular are aware. Moreover, in the higher religions, Zarathushtra, for example, founded the worship of Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lord or Supreme Being in Iran, as the champion of the cattle-rearing farmers, against the marauding nomadic Turanians, and identified the good life with agriculture, while neither Islam nor Judaism has been confined to a pastoral type of society. But if it is a question of origins, it must be admitted that prior to the rise of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent, the existence of a Sky-religion is purely conjectural under Palaeolithic con- ditions. But whatever may be said about some of the generalizations in this illuminating volume, it is a work of mature scholarship and great learning embodying an inquiry conducted over a very long period with exemplary</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 307 care for accuracy in the record of the valuable data collected with persis- tent skill. Although it is not primarily concerned with folklore as such, it is, nevertheless, a mine of information from which the folklorist can extract quantities of valuable material for his own purposes. E.
