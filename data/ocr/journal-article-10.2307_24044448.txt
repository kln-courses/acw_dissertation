For the Western reader, terrorism is that dwells within. now ineluctably associated with al-Quaeda, and Simpson be gins his book with the destruction on the World Trade Romantics were fascinated by the figure of the stran ger, and Simpson teases out the historical, political, psycho logical, and textual reasons why and their implications. He argues that "with romanticism, the question of the stranger becomes more charged with anxious significance than it had been before, and the complexity of its figurations can seem to proliferate indefinitely in a process of cross referencing that appears relentlessly accumulative." For instance, the Ma lay who knocks—or may have knocked—on Thomas de Quincey's door in Confessions of an English Opium Eater (1821): opium takes anthropomorphic shape in the figure of the oriental stranger, who appears, swallows a seemingly fatal quantity of the drug, and then disappears as if in a dream state. In terms of De Quincey's psychological experimental ization, the Malay is a stranger whose disappearance preoc cupies his imagination. The "event"—in all of its uncertainty—signals a moment of connection between West and East, home and empire, the familiar and the strange: globalization in all of its complexities. Center, having already written eloquently on the Michael Arad's memorial to those who died in the collapse of the Twin Towers—which, he argues, creates a vertiginous sense of terror in the viewer (London Review of Books, Nov. 17, 2011). And yet as Simpson recognizes, these attacks were the outcome of long-term Anglo-American imperialism in the Middle East. To read these attacks under the sign of the stranger, therefore, simultaneously obscures real questions of economic and military intervention—rhetorical strategy Adam Curtis presciently explored in his documentary The Power of Nightmares. The opening chapter theorizes French Revolutionary debates in England concerning foreigners in relation to a deep history of the notion of the stranger. Simpson consid ers the idea of the stranger from both classical-pagan and Judeo-Christian perspectives. He examines the ethics of the host-guest compact in Sophocles and Euripides, and ana lyzes, through Freud's Moses and Monotheism, the figure of the stranger at the heart of both early Judaism and Christianity. Paradoxically, given their histories of exclusion, monothe Romanticism and the Question of the Stranger is magisterial isms form as an effect of trade beyond the city-state: bringing in the sense that Simpson ranges from Sophocles's Oedipus at strangers into their compact.

Yet it is is in Romantic repositioning of self-understanding, in a way that Romantic writing, he argues, that both politics and rhetoric fully connects the personal and the political.
