<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Essence of the Sociology of Knowledge: A Discussion of the Stark Thesis Anthony J. Prosen, S.J. Loyola University Employing the system of Karl Marx's dialectical socioeconomic material- ism and Karl Mannheim's historical relativism, Werner Stark crystallizes a sociology of knowledge in the light of the Scheler-Weber tradition of sociological realism. The essence of the sociology of knowledge concerns itself with the horizontal relations between thought and thinkers. It represents a world-view that affirms society in the light of value-facts in said society, considering religious thought and values as the primary ob- jects of knowledge confronting its hermeneutical method. Leaving ab- struse thoughts to others, the sociology of knowledge interprets the his- torical manifestation of truth in society as a community of knowers. David Hume proffers wise words to the sociologist of knowledge. In his In- quiry Concerning Human Understand- ing, he tells us that man is a sociable no less than a reasonable being. .. . Abstruse and profound researches I prohibit and will severly punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce, by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you, and by the cold re- ception your pretended discoveries shall meet with when communi- cated. Be a philosopher, but amidst all your philosophy, be a man.' As ironic as these words may seem- flowing from Hume's pen-sociologists of knowledge may nevertheless boast to live by them. For sociology is the scientific study of patterned, shared human behavior. Succinctly, sociology focuses upon the fact of human "togetherness"; or, as a metaphysician would expurgate it, it studies the extrinsic nature of a real re- lation between mulitple terms and leaves the instrinsic nature of the re- spective terms and the reality involved in the relation itself to the philosopher and other scientists, affirming that this real relation is founded in reality. At the very outset, the sociologist assumes postulates which are proven in the other sciences. Thus, he recognizes overt and covert patterns of social be- havior clustering around the social func- tion they are meant to perform. This set of patterns is conceptualized as a social role that the individual enacts. When he gathers together the patterned roles which center upon a certain social function, he has a social institution. Finally, all the institutions combined as a totality and existing among a given people are conceptualized as the cul- ture. Culture, however, is a rather static element, and does not undergo muta- tions easily. While it more or less ves- tigially perdures as characteristically 1 David Hume, Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Charles W. Hendel (ed.), New York: Library of Liberal Arts, 1955, p. 18. 9</page><page sequence="2">10 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Gothic, Incan, or Baroque, it neverthe- less assumes that there are social persons involved to perpetuate it. And so, in addition to studying social patterns, the sociologist also studies social persons in whom the basic fundament for the real relation called society is founded. When- ever reciprocal social roles exist, this in- teraction is called human relations. The matrix of human relations, we might say with Max Scheler, Pitirim Sorokin, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, is love justly and equitably rendered. These human relations occur, therefore, in groups in which people cooperate to- ward the fulfillment of social needs. Various needs bring various persons to play various roles in various groups. When all of the groups are conceptual- ized as a connected, loving, and dynamic totality, we have the object of sociolog- ical investigation, society. The particular societies employ cultures peculiar to them. Hence, the fact that social persons are involved in socio-cultural or dynamic- static relations implies a certain relativ- ism insofar as all things are in flux; yet, the axiological measurement of these socio-cultural relations is based on norms which can be gleaned from the scientific, objective investigation of the social phe- nomena which is caused by constant, loving interaction among perennially rational-social persons. Thus, the sociolo- gist not only diagnoses the structure of society, but he commingles himself with the socio-cultural data and, out of a pure desire to know, empirically constructs a real sociology of knowledge. It is necessary first to distinguish be- tween a social theory of knowledge and the sociology of knowledge. As Gerard De Gre observes, the social theory of knowledge, in contrast, "is an epistemo- logical position that attempts to infer from the findings of gnosio-sociology cer- tain hypotheses concerning the relation- ship between propositions and that which the propositions are about."2 Of such a nature, for instance, are the statements of Emile Durkheim about the social position of the categories and other ideas. If Durkheim's position is pushed to the philosophical hilt, it be- comes a kind of social idealism which posits that, although the "world" is not the "idea" of any specific individual, as some of the subjective idealists have maintained, it is a kind of "collective idea" and exists only in the "collective consciousness." Now, when Durkheim and others make statements like this, they are not speaking as sociologists, but as epistemologists. Such epistemological statements which philosophers would dutifully challenge must be carefully dis- tinguished from the preliminary sociol- ogy-of-knowledge analysis that Durk- heim makes of the social factors, such as religious festivals, kinship and clan groups, and spatial arrangements of vil- lages that influence the epistemological conceptions of space, time, and causal- ity among other things.3 If this distinc- tion between a social theory of knowl- edge and the sociology of knowledge is carefully maintained, and the exclu- sive reference of sociology-of-knowledge propositions to the relations between thoughts and thinkers, and not thoughts and facts, is kept in mind, this Durk- heimian confusion-which constantly crops up with reference to the sociology- of-knowledge research and its supposed trespassing on the precincts of episte- mology-will be cleared up, to the mutual benefit of both sociologists and 2 Gerard De Gre, "The Sociology of Knowl- edge and the Problem of Truth," The Journal of the History of Ideas, 2 (January, 1941), p. 115. 3 Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, New York: Macmillan, 1915, esp. pp. 1-28, 268-292. Also noteworthy is his Sociology and Philosophy, London: Cohen and West, 1953, wherein he confuses the two sciences in a subjective moral relativism.</page><page sequence="3">ESSENCE OF SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE 11 those other thinkers who are concerned with the analysis, hermeneutic, and his- tory of thought.4 In an attempt to bridge the gulf be- tween the sociological (which uses scientific method in much the same man- ner as does natural science, and goes through the same steps of development from the natural history stage of collect- ing relevant facts to the stage of hy- pothesis, theory, and demonstration) and the philosophical (which uses another and radically different method of proof and procedure in normative social theory and social philosophy), Werner Stark of Fordham University proposes this thesis: There is a vital correspondence between the substructure of practice and the superstructure of theory, be- tween life and thought; and this rests on the (assumed) fact that the same order of values works itself out, both in action and in specula- tion.5 This enunciation is demonstrated when Stark lays his foundation by foiling his position against those of Karl Marx and Karl Mannheim, and finally includes what is worthwhile in theirs and sundry neo-Kantians and theists in the crystal- lization of his own thesis. MARX'S DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM Concerning Marx's dialectical socio- economic materialism, Stark notes that, in his ideological construction work there is a sense in which ideological thought springs from value judgment and is thus prejudiced, whereas socially determined thought, which Stark prefers, does not and hence is free from taint; furthermore, there is another sense in which it must be admitted that socially determined thought is based on an antecedently existing order of values. The very concept of social determination implies such a tie. Social determination therefore means that thought is deter- mined by the contemporary patterns of social life; but the latter in turn is de- termined by the fundamental values which the society itself is pursuing. Out of this conviction arises Stark's thesis (71). Thus, Marx's position that ideolo- gies, such as the religious phenomenon- that "opium of the people"-are mere constructs which should not exist in society is an apparent contradiction of the social facts and of his own interpre- tations of the romantic transcendentalist Hegel and the rationalistic Encyclopae- dists (101). In this, Marx is an unsuc- cessful magician mingling fire with water and only producing a lot of steam into which, Stark is convinced, his social theory and sociology of knowledge must inevitably dissolve. MANNHEIM S HISTORICAL RELATIVISM Concerning Mannheim's historical rel- ativism, Stark's chief argument is more sophisticated. Mannheim first distin- guished between special and general, particular and total, evaluative and non- evaluative conceptions of ideology. What Mannheim calls the "special-particular- evaluative conception of ideology"" obviously deals with phenomena which Stark describes as ideological tout court (102); and what Mannheim calls the "general-total-non-evaluative conception of ideology" refers to thought that is situationally determined rather than ideological. Actually, Mannheim is not talking about ideology at all; according 4 De Gre, loc. cit. 5 Werner Stark, The Sociology of Knowl- edge, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1958, p. 71.

Stark believes that Mannheim con- fuses his thought in failing to distinguish sufficiently between the ideological and the social determination of thinking (103); society still appears to Mann- heim, as it did to Marx, as essentially an arena of struggling social and political forces, and he sees the thought-process taking place in the human mind as far too closely involved in these struggles. Stark believes that concentration on in- stitutional struggles for power imparts to the sociology of knowledge a bias to- ward interpreting ideas partly or even wholly as ideologies proper. Thus, Mann- heim gains in theory, but loses in prac- tice. In his classic Ideology and Utopia, he could write, "Both the ideologist, logist, panegyrist of the past, and the utopian, harbinger of things to come, are primarily anti-intellectualistic, i.e., not concerned with the truth."7 More illustrative of his theory is the subse- quent passage, rife with implications. Mannheim writes: The concept of ideology reflects the one discovery which emerged from political conflict, namely, that ruling classes can in their thinking become so intensively interest-bound to a situation that they are simply no longer able to see certain facts which would undermine their sense of domination. There is implicit in the world ideology the insight that in certain situations the collective unconscious of certain groups ob- scures the real condition of society both to itself and to others and thereby stabilizes it. The concept of utopian thinking reflects the opposite discovery of the political struggle, namely, that certain oppressed groups are intel- lectually so strongly interested in the destruction and transformation of a given condition of society that they unwittingly see only those elements in the situation which tend to negate it. Their thinking is in- capable of correctly diagnosing an existing condition of society. They are not at all concerned with what really exists; but rather in their thinking they already seek to change the situation that exists. Their thought is never a diagnosis of the situation; it can be used only as a di- rection for action. In the utopian mentality, the collective uncon- sciousness guided by wishful repre- sentation, and the will to action, hides certain aspects of reality. It turns its back on everything which would shake its belief or paralyze its desire to change things.8 Perhaps Stark might accept this as sit- uational determinism. However. Mann- heim, sometimes called a bourgeois Marxist, comes far too close to a pan- ideological conception of the human mind, despite the consciously "non-eval- uative" character of his approach; and so, together with Marx, Stark rejects him as inadequate on this count (104). THE CONCERN OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE In the Rickert-Weber tradition, Stark proceeds to discourse on his sociology of knowledge based on this paradigm (108): The concern of the sociology of knowl- edge is: (1) The subject and his ap- proach: (a) The categorical layer of the mind, (b) The physical apparatus of perception, (c) The axiological layer of the mind; (2) The objective world: (a) The objects of knowledge, (b) The materials of knowledge. Alas, while many would insist that the 7 Ibid., p. 69. 8 Ibid., p. 36.</page><page sequence="5">ESSENCE OF SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE 13 materials of knowledge must remain un- known, although somehow present, Stark now insists that the sociologist of knowledge must affirm that these materials are not only present, but also knowable. Stanislaw Warynski has strongly demonstrated that empirical data, as unorganized as it may be, is indispensable to the social scientist if he is to in-form the materials by use of the categories beyond the axiological layer of the mind (110). However, Warynski is passed over as a naive realist; and Mannheim's extramental reality is adopted as meaning relatively the same materials of knowledge, only as a more sophisticated mirror of historical subject- matter which is not only identical in itself, but also belongs to the essential conditions of the epoch. Gleaning this aspect to compliment his Weberian view, Stark cites Mannheim's Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge (105), thus: The essence and the actual exist- ence of Hellenism do not dissolve themselves into the various "per- spectives" opened up by successive generations of historical scholarship. It is, in fact, 'given" as a "thing in itself," approached from various sides, as it were, by different inter- pretations. We are justified in posit- ing this real being of the object in se. . The realization that behind the objects of knowledge already constituted as such there lies the sphere of the mate- rials of knowledge, from which these objects are selected by thinkers, is sufficiently more sophisticated than Warynski's proof to be acceptable to Stark. As problematic as this point is, Stark believes the solution and summation is best recapitulated by the subsequent citation from Scheler's Die Wissensfor- men und die Gesellschaft (111-112): Knowledge is an existential rela- tionship, and one which presupposes the existential forms whole and part. It is the relation of participation of an existing being in the attributes (Sosein) of another existent entity by which no change is brought about in the latter. What is "known" be- comes a "part" of the "knower," but without moving in any way from its place or being otherwise trans- formed. This ontological relation- ship is not a spatial, temporal or causal relationship. "Mens" or "mind" we call the X or the sum and sub- stance of the acts in the "knowing" being by dint of which such a par- ticipation is possible; by which a thing, or rather the attributes-and only the attributes-of an existing thing become an "ens intentionale in contradistinction to a mere reality ("ens reale") which always and nec- essarily remains outside and beyond the relationship of knowing. The root of this X, the direction-giving moment for the realization of acts which lead to some form of par- ticipation, can only be that self- transcending . . . interest in it which, in its most formal sense, we call "love." Knowledge is there, and only there, where the attributes are, in strict identity, both extra mentem, i.e., in re, and at the same time also in mente-as ens intentionale or as "object." And so, it may be said, out of love and interest come cultural preferences, ex- pressions, and interpretations of the fundamental institutions of society. The objects of knowledge are informed and given a value in the ordo amoris, which, if correctly interpreted, is perfectly legitimate. For as your treasures are dis-</page><page sequence="6">14 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS tributed, so is your heart. The axiolog- ical layer of the mind now comes into play and social values which often de- termine social knowing or the "climate of interest" must be examined. THE ROLE OF SOCIAL VALUES In general, social values are the norms or measure by which members of a soci- ety standardize their behavior. The so- cial fact of existing values enjoins the sociologist to analyze and interpret the facts in their origin, development, func- tion, effect, and degree of conformity. More than this, accordingly, belongs to the moral philosopher. Nonetheless, Stark's axiological layer may have phil- osophic implications-as almost any- thing does; indeed, he admits that the ordo amoris ultimately comes from Kant and Scheler, and that it is an a priori system of social prejudgment which en- ables us to form, out of the infinite of the knowable, the finite and hence the com- prehensible universe of the known (113). In other words, whether the a priori system is metaphysically grounded, based on eternal law, mechanistically or heuristically given, or anything else, is the concern of the moral philosopher and epistemologist; that such a priori judgments are manifest in the social phenomena is evident and is therefore the concern of the sociologist. Stark's axiological layer of the mind's function is summarily presented in an- other passage from Scheler's Die Wis- sensformen und die Geselleschaft (114- 115): A sociological law of knowledge which comes to the surface in the origin of modern science is . . . the way in which the amateur comes before the expert, the dilettante be- fore the scientist, love before knowl- edge. Each new objective realm which science has conquered in her history has had first to be seized in an excess of affection: only then could there supervene an age of sober and intellectually more objec- tive research. . . . The extent and nature of the process of sympathetic empathy into, and identification with, nature are vastly different in the different epochs of human his- tory. At the heights of the Middle Ages they reach a minimum of ex- tent and intensity. In the Renais- sance this inherent potentiality of man's mind and soul breaks forth with hurricane force.. . . Emotional outbreaks of this kind occur through- out the history of western science. ... To think-that is precisely what the Schoolmen could do more acutely and sharply, more artfully and meth- odically than the bulk of all the modern generations of scientists. Initially, it was an orgiastic and ecstatic, emotional surrender to na- ture and a new experiential attitude which brought an opening-up of the mind towards the world . . . which led beyond bookish knowledge and narrow anthropomorphism. And Stark concludes: This new love of nature, which, in contradiction of the well-known adage, made men attentive to her true character, rather than blind to it, was not like the Christian agape which demands the passive surrender of the lover to the loved one, but resembled rather the heathen eros with its active desire to appropriate, to have and to hold the beloved. For this reason domination became the decisive axiological element, the cultural value-attitude, from which the study of reality was un- dertaken, and which, in the fullness of time, was to lead to the integral modern world-view (115).</page><page sequence="7">ESSENCE OF SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE 15 Expressed theologically by Calvin and Loyola, politically by Bodin, Hobbes, Machiavelli and others, this world-view ousted by degrees the value structure of ancient feudalism with its high valua- tion of man over man, and of man over the organic realm. It ousted at the same time the contemplative quest for knowl- edge and virtue of the clergy and monks, of the great universities whose desire was only to see and mirror the essences of beautiful reality. The Jesuit emphasis on the glorification of the will of the Divine Majesty is a pertinent cultural illustration of this axiological change in society's worldview. Observing these changes, Scheler could write (117): It is the idea and value of hu- man power and human freedom vis- a-vis nature which inspires the great centuries of discoveries and inven- tions, not merely the idea of utility. . . . We are confronted with a change in direction in the will to power, away from God and men toward things. ... As technological knowledge holds the wand of social transformation, cultural and religious knowledge fades; as the relatively natural, or common sense, world-view seems to be the underpin- ning of a sociology of knowledge, Kant's absolutized relative world-view, which assumed all men's minds were like a Newtonian physicist's, wanes. Indeed, the dynamism of society refutes the so- cial philosopher who has so often abso- lutized the relative. Thus, Stark con- cludes: For modern man it is as "natural" not to see ghosts and spirits lurking in nature as it is to see them for primitive man. Notwithstanding the possibility that there may be a con- stant factor running through all so- cial systems and invariably present in man's picture of reality, what con- crete men see in the world and of the world, and how they see what they do see, depends-according to Scheler, and also to the Sociology of Knowledge-on a socio-historical principle of specification, of crystal- lization, of ordered selection and co- ordinating construction, and that principle is inherent in the axiolog- ical or value-structure prevailing at the time. The world of the abso- lute cannot be grasped by us hu- mans. How can the finite mind hope to lay hold on the infinite? By our whole constitution we are forced to live in a universe of restricted aware- ness. Our world-view will always be relative, however "natural" we who live within it may feel it to be. And in every society the governing rela- tion will be to the axiomata or guid- ing values in and by which the so- ciety concerned has organized its existence, its activities, and conse- quently also its mental conceptions and procedures. For life, action and thought must always form a work- ing partnership, an inclusive whole (118-119). SOCIAL DETERMINATION The unique position that Stark holds, then, is found in his differentiation be- tween society as process and society as production. Whereas Marx could not divorce theory from practice, because the knower and worker are one, and society must manufacture a world-view for itself that is the product of its process of production, Stark, in the Rickert- Weber-Scheler tradition, splits this ma- terialistic thinking into the mental power moulding Mannheim's extra-mental real- ity (122). And whereas Mannheim held a pragmatist-positivist-political bias in his historical relativism, Stark, freed from ideological shennanigans, believes that the a priori social category in the nature</page><page sequence="8">16 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS of man provides an axiological layer which can influence the object and ma- terials of knowledge in changes of time and space. Thus, the values which are established at the basis of his world-view are "value-facts" or objective values, de- clared by the pure desire to know which penetrates all patterns of subjective val- uations. These are given in and by the life of the society concerned, and are operative before any individual can as- sert any private prejudice of his own. These value-facts maneuver a man into a particular situation, but there will always be an objective assessment of the situation, an objective truth in that sit- uation. For instance: A man may look at Mont Blanc or the Matterhorn from the north or the south, or from any number of positions: none of them is in itself superior to any other; none can be singled out by objective criteria as giving the nearest approach to ob- jective truth; they all offer an equal chance of the truth. All depends, so far as truth is concerned, on the man who occupies a given position: if he will open his eyes wide and allow nothing to deflect or dim his perception, he will recognize the mountains as in fact they are. Any- body in the same place would have to come to the same results; hence the results are generally valid, and undeniably so. And so it is with all students and all studies of reality. Values maneuver a man into a cer- tain vantage-point: but valuation need not falsify the vision. He can always speak of the truth as he sees it; it will be the objective truth in his situation (127). Here we have the crystallization of Stark's concept of social determination which he opposes to his predecessors' ideologies. And so, in Stark's sociology of knowl- edge, it is the world-view that affirms the society; and in order to understand the world-view of any society, we must understand the value-facts of said soci- ety.9 Thus, it is childish to be as intol- erant as the Encyclopaedists who dog- matically disdain whoever does not hold their view, for it is the different value- systems resulting in different world- views which all tally with the data. In his position, therefore, Stark can affirm that many men know many views of the truth, for no man can know all-truth; he believes that an ever-active longing for truth is more desirable than the pos- session of truth itself. Valid as this may be in the realm of historico-scientific knowledge, metaphys- icians will doubtless have their say. Yet, it may be said, that we proceed by ac- cumulating perspectives and by attain- ing ever more inclusive syntheses; but, in the analysis of any one valid act of knowing, in the glimpse of any one per- spective, metaphysicians will have to agree that scientists discover certain ini- tial grasps of absolute truth without which we could never set out on the quest of the whole. The general typology which Stark has in mind would acquaint us with the various axiological vantage-points from which the concrete societies encountered in history have looked out upon the realm of the materials of knowledge. It would tell us why they have made cer- tain aspects of the real their prime con- cern and bypassed others; for instance, Archduke Ferdinand's assassination was 9 For illustrations of this method applied, cf. W. Montgomery Watt, Islam and the In- tegration of Society, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1961; and Truth in the Re- ligions, Edinburgh: University Press, 1963. The latter is especially pertinent to the sociology of religion. It demonstrates the function of the sociology of knowledge in the interpretation of the religious phenomena in a unique way.</page><page sequence="9">ESSENCE OF SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE 17 cataclysmic, but we have not yet de- cided on the social significance-if there is any-of President Kennedy's assassina- tion. It would also tell us why they con- stituted their object of knowledge in the way they did. Therefore, Stark's macro- sociological metasociology of knowledge would deal with the results of man's search for truth as well as the different directions which it has taken. He would have us co-ordinate social results in a kind of Summa (206-207). Essentially, then, the sociology of knowledge is a hermeneutical method, not a dogmatic metasociology. It leaves the arguments of specious metaphysical assumptions concerning superstructures, categories and substructures-of being and thought-to the philosopher. Yet, assuming no schizophrenia between the social and private person, the former throws light on the latter and considera- tion of the latter enlightens understand- ing of human thoughts and feelings. The task of the sociology of knowledge, there- fore, is merely to explore by way of real- istic research and by accumulation of analytical case-histories how close the connection between social substructure and mental superstructure in fact is, and consequently how great is the contribu- tion which the sociological study of men- tal phenomena can make to the under- standing of culture and its development. As noted above, W. Montgomery Watt's Islam and the Integration of Society is a fine illustration of the application of this procedure. It demonstrates that the so- ciologists' future lies not in abstract spec- ulation, but in real exploration. Thus, sociologists cannot destroy past achievements, as the pure progressive systems of Comte and Marx would have it, which would degrade human thought to a status of epiphenomena; but so- ciologists must reject all dogmatic pon- tification about the ontological nature of the interrelation between thought and life. Although there may be such meta- physical assumptions, he must not raise the interrelation of the social phenomena to the dignity of dogmatic assertion. In this way, Stark again diverges from Kant's dogmatic way (210). Indeed, in his relations, man is truly creative and dynamically functioning; nevertheless, he is not mathematically time-less and so forth, but, as Stark believes, he is time-bound and ever-changing, cast into a concrete contemporary social life. Summarily, "the sociologist is only con- cerned with what is being internalized, not with the process of internalization- the sociologist in the general meaning of the term, with the norms of society, its external order, the sociologist of knowl- edge with its world-view or universe of thought" (142). In other words, the so- ciologist of knowledge studies a society of thinkers, and he tries to understand the manifestation and stimuli of their thoughts. In a hermeneutical method, the creative spirit of man commingles in society, which is formed and informs; knowledge progresses fact by fact and progressively builds on the stepping- stones of the past which cannot be de- stroyed. While culture frames society and changes only through human forces, the society within the cultural frame- work is dynamically free, as experience reveals; and, finally, there is no intel- ligibility to the thought the thinkers think about society apart from society. An example illustrates this latter point: when laissez-faire was at its acme, Friedrich Nietzche, admittedly under the influence of socio-psychological ele- ments, lost all social integration, failed in the essential cooperation of society, and ended in megalomania (150). While all such thought cannot be described as deranged or irrational, it nevertheless can be affirmed with David Hume, with whose wisdom we began our discourse, that the thinker may think all he wants</page><page sequence="10">18 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS by himself, and the philosopher may in- deed philosophize and explore the per- ceptual apparatus and categorical layer of the mind to the very brink of obliv- ion; but when he speaks, let him remem- ber that he is not only reasonable, but necessarily sociable, and he must co- operatively speak in, for, and to society in which he exists, if he is to be at all reasonable, intelligible, lovable, and- finally-a man. So it is that Stark can enunciate his thesis: "There is a vital correspondence between the substructure of practice and the superstructure of theory, between life and thought; and this rests on the (assumed) fact that the same order of values works itself out, both in action and in speculation" (71). The essence of the sociology of knowledge is there- fore found in a group of thinkers about thoughts shared in common, among whom each is an individual thinker and a social person; this method is primarily hermeneutical and in communication with society as a community of knowers striving to penetrate the sunburst of the beauteous absolute.</page></plain_text>
