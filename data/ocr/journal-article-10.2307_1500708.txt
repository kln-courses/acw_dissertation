<plain_text><page sequence="1">British Educational Research Journal, Vol. 12, No. 2, 1986 Intuitive Theories-a Researcher's Dilemma: some practical methodological implications MAUREEN POPE &amp; PAM DENICOLO, University of Surrey Introduction In stating that we see our own implicit theories as an integral part of the research process and that we see as a major purpose of our investigations 'verstehen' we are disclosing our bias towards a hermeneutical or qualitative-interpretative approach to research. As psychologists concerned with educational research we are well aware that: Quantitative research is the dominant methodology in educational re- search. It is more widely published, taught, accepted, and rewarded in educational research circles than any other approach. In the extreme, quantitative research is characterised as equivalent to The Scientific Method. (Rist, 1977, p. 42) Any resemblance to psychological research is not accidental since scientific behaviourism and psychometrics are often used in support of such a paradigm. Despite swings away from the theoretical notions inherent in these psychological standpoints, in practice much published psychological research still seems to embrace values consistent with the quantitative model. This is not the place to debate the relative merits of quantitative versus qualita- tive approaches to research indeed, as Rist points out, if the complexities of research approaches are reduced to simple polarities we are in danger of producing 'methodological provincialism'. Nevertheless, currently there exists a schism of values between researchers which relates to the quantitative-qualitative dichotomy and is often rooted in the positivism-idealism debate of the late nineteenth century. The diagrams in Ap- pendix A draw attention to distinctive constellations of key ideas inherent in the two approaches. The approaches have been expanded in e.g. Rist (1977), Eisner (1981), Terhart (1982), Pope, Watts &amp; Gilbert (1983) although various labels have been used to categorise the dichotomy. 153</page><page sequence="2">154 M. Pope &amp; P. Denicolo Smith (1983) argues that: At the extreme, the methodology appropriate to one approach will be seen as irrelevant from the perspective of the other. (Smith, 1983, p. 13) In appendices A1 +2 we chose to represent the ideas in the two approaches as linked to central metaphors re the nature of the person because ultimately, the issues are not simply ones of research strategy per se but are linked to such fundamental commitments. We recognise that this once again presents what may be a 'false' dichotomy however we feel that this dichotomy exists both in educational research literature and in the mythology of research practice. We appreciate that these approaches have been discussed elsewhere (see e.g. Lincoln, 1985) however we rehearse the main terms in this introduction in order to (a) locate our own epistemological stance and (b) provide the frame work for discussion of dilemmas that the existence of such paradigms poses for educational researchers. Our work has been concerned with the investigation of intuitive theories held by pupils, students and teachers about a range of topics, e.g. scientific concepts such as energy, the nature of learning and teaching, the role of metaphor in explanation. We would suggest that the very choice of intuitive theories as a focus of investigation represents an epistemological stance consistent with the qualitative-interpretative approach. It is not our intention to present 'results' in this paper. These have been reported elsewhere see e.g. Pope &amp; Keen (1981), Gilbert &amp; Pope (1982), Denicolo (1983a, b) and Pope &amp; Scott (1984). We would focus instead on some practical methodological issues which we think face those who investigate intuitive theories adopting a 'qualitative-interpretative' approach. The approach itself is often seen as an 'easy option' not least amongst some of its practitioners who deny the need to consider methodological rigor. We would argue that, far from being easy, it brings its own distinctive concerns re the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data which should be discussed with the same seriousness amongst psychological and educational researchers as, for example, issues such as the rotation process in factor analysis! In this paper we will present some methodological issues and amplify them with examples which have arisen within the context of our own research. In particular we will focus on the interview as a research tool and on strategies of data reduction and pose a paradox within contemporary educational research. The Interview as a Research Tool First, let us focus on the interview as a research tool. When chosen to uncover individual theories it carries with it certain implications and obligations. Verbal dialogue, as opposed to any form of written questionnaire, has advantages such as (i) flexibility-areas which the interviewees signal as important to them can be followed up and (ii) increased depth-the interviewees can be encouraged to articulate hows and why as well as to illustrate their answers with exemplars so that their own personal interpretation of words becomes evident. This allows the interviewee to retain their autonomy while facilitating the interviewer's attempts to provide as full a description as possible. However, it must be recognised that the data derived is the product of an interactive exercise. The ensuing verbatim transcript is a result of both the questions</page><page sequence="3">Intuitive Theories 155 in the mind of the interviewer which originally defined his/her research and ideas and questions which developed during the interview and other interactions with the interviewee. Denicolo provides an example of this in that, in her pilot study about explanation in chemistry, "perceived rapport between teachers and students" did not appear as a variable for consideration. However, interviews in that study in which students frequently spoke of understanding better those teachers who they 'got on with' or who attempted to see their viewpoints, suggested that it should have a place in the main study. The developments to ongoing research are as much dependent on the interviewer skills in perceptive listening as on his or her questioning technique. Perceptive listening involves the taking into account of non- verbal cues to meaning, such as tone, gestures, expressions, etc. which in turn illuminate what lies beneath or beyond the surface of the spoken word. It also involves being sensitive to ideas that are tentatively hinted at, or are perhaps being avoided. For instance, again in Denicolo's research, one teacher always answered early interview questions about his own views on the nature of science by discuss- ing possible student views although he was willing to divulge in depth his own views on teaching and learning. In later interviews, when this was queried, he spoke of "feeling rather at a disadvantage in that rather philosophical area" since he saw himself as "not a great scientific brain, just as a plodder who is quite good at putting the basic stuff over". Thus for a fuller understanding empathic interviewers should attempt as far as possible to feel their way into the internal frame of reference of their interviewees. In his book The Helping Interview, Benjamin cites Ekman's words: We hear with our ears, but we listen with our eyes and mind and heart and skin and guts as well. (Ekman, 1964) This immediately raises certain implications for the analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. First of all, one must acknowledge to oneself that the situational context and one's own personal intuitive theories colour interpretation. For instance, passages may be chosen from a verbatim transcript to illustrate and evidence anothers 'intended' meaning. The problem is, to quote Hull (1984): But they are evidence in support of interpretations rooted in the black- market of my own private understanding in the unpublishable 'second record', not in the 'documents of the case'. (Hull, 1984) In this context, in her thesis, Denicolo queried whether the feeling of warmth generated when the teacher, the class and the observer collapsed in giggles over a particular incident was any less evidence of class rapport than words transcribed from a tape-recorded interview. Secondly, and almost contradictory, one must provide prospective readers with an open, frank and detailed discussion of the procedures used in analysis and interpretation of data. Although we support the notions that descriptions are elaborations of 'grounded theory' (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) and that data collection is a phenomenological and very personal experience we do not hold with those who argue that, because of this their methodology and stated outcomes can not be questionned by those outside the experience of the particular research. Those who present their deductions with no acknowledgement of their provenance are doing a disservice, not only to the reader, but also to the participants. In this we agree with Rist (1980) who suggested that in doing so:</page><page sequence="4">156 M. Pope &amp; P. Denicolo The logic of the method becomes inverted. Rather than make the uncom- mon and unknown comprehendable and defence becomes one of privatis- ing what ought to have been open to scrutiny. To further grasp the nettle, what of the other criteria of traditional research-reli- ability and validity? While eschewing the mantle of quantitative research and donning that of the qualitative paradigm, we must nevertheless present our work as credible and creditable i.e. it must have authenticity. In so doing we must confront problems commensurate with those of reliability and validity which arise in this area (Lecompte &amp; Goetz, 1982). These may be illustrated by reference to Denicolo's current empirical studies: (a) within a transcript inconsistencies may arise where a view is espoused early in the interview, only to be negated later, e.g. ealier I said... but we are more relaxed now, I think I undersold myself there-what I mean is... Is the off-the-cuff or the more relaxed, thought out view more truly reprsentative of this teachers ideas? (b) the interview itself may act as a catalyst, producing changes in ideas and perspectives. To continue the chemical metaphor, in a follow-up interview Deni- colo had with one teacher, the interviewee said of the first encounter: Its like putting a thermometer in anything, its a constraint on the system and it will change. The solution to these problems may again rely on the presentation of lengthy verbatim transcripts and context descriptions alongside interpretations. However, even with a very small sample or an individual case study, this could result in a voluminous document. This is a major problem whichever of the professional hats one wears. As a PhD student, it involves the production of a bulky, unwieldy thesis. As a teacher, although interested in research authentic to the classroom, there is a time constrait imposed on the reading of lengthy prose. Authenticity must be tempered with utility. As a scholar/researcher wishing to publish the results of one's labours, one finds that the dominant current demand is for short, concise papers preferably with tabulations of results. In summary, one is confronted with a tension between, on the one hand, adequate justification of categorisations and qualifications of suggestions and, on the other hand, demands for time and concentration from interested readers and space from publishers. Given these caveats, what alternative strategies are available for the representa- tion of data collected within the qualitative-interpretative paradigm? Strategies of Data Reduction Much of the debate between the two approaches to research referred to earlier revolves round issues of research design and data collection procedures. For those concerned with 'intuitive theories', what would be the consequences of utilising techniques of data reduction taken from the quantitative model? After all, as Rist (1977) suggested:</page><page sequence="5">Intuitive Theories 157 It may well be that when the 'familiar instruments' of quantitative and qualitative methodologies are juxtaposed we will 'see new and different things'. (Kuhn, 1970, p. 10) Our research group at Surrey generally advocates a consistency between the resear- chers' philosophical assumptions underpinning the research to be conducted and the tools of data collection and analysis chosen (Swift, Watts &amp; Pope, 1983). However, conscious of the difficulties outlined above and suggestions such as that of Rist, several members have explored the potential of using a priori categories in our data analysis-this being a technique well established in the quantitative model. The results of these explorations in relation to our work with intuitive theories have certainly led us to see 'new and different things' but as we will indicate below these have tended to confirm our anti-reductionist stance. There now exists a number of research reports which have used the Interview- about-Instances (IAI) approach to study children's intuitive theories about scientific concepts such as force, energy, heat see e.g. Osborne and Gilbert 1980, Watts 1983a and Zylbersztajn 1983. This type of work, much of which has been carried out by our research group, has tended to attract labels such as study of childrens' 'misconceptions' or more recently 'alternative conceptions' or 'alternative frameworks' research. Watts (1983b) clearly described his data degradation process as he moved from considera- tion of child's alternative conceptions, through categorisation of examplars of these conceptions using verbatim quotes as evidence to the production of descriptions of a range of 'alternative conceptual frameworks.' Although starting from a holistic approach one 'end product' of his work is a much reduced description of the construing of the individuals in his study which, if taken out of context, is also devoid of consideration of the particular choices made by the researcher in his conduct of data collection and analysis. Watts (1982) made the following comment re the "pithy summary statements" he used to characterise childrens' conceptions of energy: The framework here came from no one pupil. They have been placed together from the implicit and explicit conceptions used by the children during the course of the interviews... The frameworks are not intended as discrete and mutually exclusive classifications, but as characterising and sometimes over-lapping categories of interview responses. This is an important point. The expressions youngsters use can be classified in a number of ways. In this case their words are being taken as evidence for particular ways of treating the term energy. [Watts (1982) chapter in Gilbert and Pope (1982) p. 14 (our emphasis).] However the busy teacher or researcher with a prediliction towards reductionism may well ignore the 'health warnings' conveyed in our research reports. Instead they will indulge in a 'framework spotting' exercise using reified descriptions of frame- works and ignoring the ontology of these frameworks. The intention of researchers within the field of 'alternative frameworks' is usually to draw the attention of the reader to the issue that people have personally viable constructions. The 'frame- works' are categorisations of past utterances as illustrations of potential not inevita- ble future utterances which may be found. Reification and subsequent use as a label for a person as a particular type of construer seems a change in status which should be avoided. Similarly one needs to strike a delicate balance between bearing in</page><page sequence="6">158 M. Pope &amp; P. Denicolo mind the categorisations of utterances derived from prior studies and being sensi- tive to the need to account for further utterances which do not fit the modelling of such studies. It would, in our opinion be a great pity if the essential aim of this type of work were ignored and teachers and researchers played the games of 'framework match- ing' and labelling pupils instead of being alert to the diversity of personal intuitive theories children bring to the classroom and recognising their epistemological status. That this danger exists is apparent when one faces questions such as 'how generalisable are the frameworks?' and 'what types of frameworks exist at different age groups?'. As part of their analysis Gilbert &amp; Pope (1982) utilised Watts', seven energy framework descriptions and as a means of classifying their data and were able to produce tabulations of e.g. the total number of each type of framework found within each group of young children studied. See Appendix B for some description of Watts' classification. This deliberate 'framework spotting' produced interesting and publishable 'results', but it was not sufficient to do justice to the data obtained. For example, throughout their case studies could be found examples of what Gilbert &amp; Pope labelled 'multiple frameworks' where, within one utterance or short speech act, more than one of Watts' classification of frameworks was projected-for example: F. so they have energy (Human Depository) to play in the snow (Ostensive) (card 13) F. the moon's there yea and is making them shine (Ostensive) so it must be energy from the moon (on to the stars, implied Fluid transfer?) and that makes them shine so I think it's energy from the moon source... (Deposi- tory) (card 14) K. (it) goes to the box (Fluid Transfer) to get it up the hill to push (Ostensive)... I. what do you think, how do you... L. uh, it goes up to uh the brain (Fluid Transfer) and the brain knows what to do and tells you to um (Human Centred) K. yea... the brain sends the message to the muscles which pulls push the box (Human Centred) Note: Depository, Ostensive, Fluid Transfer and Human Centred refer to different 'frameworks' in Watts' Classification (see Appendix B for descriptions of frame- works). On a number of occasions it was clear that the pupil required, for example, both a Depository and an Ostensive notion in order to be satisfied with the explanation given. They often ran into problems with their explanations if they could not find a source for the energy-i.e. they searched for a Depository facet to the explanation -Ostensive framework alone was not accepted as a sufficient explanation. The existence of these 'multiple frameworks' begs the question what is the operative intuitive theory held by the pupil?-Is it several component intuitive theories or is it the system of necessary interrelationships which is the intuitive theory? When Kelly (1955) discussed his organisation corollary he suggested that know- ing that an individual possessed a particular construct was not of as much interest as knowing how (s)he organised a group of constructs into a coherent pattern. We suggest that those interested in intuitive theories need to go beyond classification of</page><page sequence="7">Intuitive Theories 159 discrete utterances of 'frameworks' towards a full description of inter-related facets of explanations. The researchers a priori assumptions about categories of potential intuitive theories form part of the context of the interview itself. Gilbert &amp; Pope (1982) explored the nature of the interviewers influence on the intuitive theories produced. Videotapes were made of small groups of 10-12 years old discussing IAI cards concerned with energy. They noted that certain types of questions seemed to evoke particular 'frameworks'. When the interviewer was present there was an increase in the number of dialogue interactions which were related to the interviewer's use of various strategies for challenging an individual's conception thus responses were probed and discussion sustained. However, when left alone in their groups, the children produced a rich set of intuitive theories, providing each other with challenges to ideas about energy that were being expressed. The argument was at their own level often drawing on their own experiences as evidence. The dynamics of this data collection method seem more realistic in terms of exploring the spontaneous reasoning and intuitive theories which children commonly use when thinking and talking about concepts to each other without prompting from an adult. The concerns that have been ex- pressed regarding the analysis of one-to-one interviews are, however, exacerbated when one is also attempting to trace issues such as the process of negotiation of intuitive theories within group discussion. The detailed discourse analysis is very time consuming, but necessary if one is to try to understand aspects of this process and we feel that the account of the data collection and analysis should not be under- reported. As was mentioned earlier, the data is a product of an interactive exercise and so as full a commentary about a priori assumptions, types of questions evolution and negotiation of intuitive theories within the interview as is possible for the resear- cher to produce is desirable. Although for the purposes of communication and interpretation some reduction is inevitable the qualitative-interpretative reseacher is faced with a delicate balanc- ing of considerations if s(he) is not to distort the complexity of intuitive theories. Pope &amp; Scott (1984) discuss their data on student teachers' epistemology and theories of teaching. There are a number of conceptual classification systems which could be used as a template againt which to categorise such data (Young, 1981; Pope &amp; Keen, 1981) however Pope &amp; Scott found many examples from transcripts posed similar analysis difficulties to the 'multiple frameworks' referred to earlier. One could disaggregate a quotation into component parts which would 'fit' one of these conceptual categorisations but the sense of the ideas being expressed indicated an explanation which embraced more than one of these seemingly discrete and mutually exclusive categories. To demonstrate further the difficulties inherent in attempts to reduce extensive data from a study of teachers, we will present an illustration from Denicolo's work. Previous research had indicated that teachers have pervasive personal theories of teaching for example: (i) 'transfer of knowledge', filling up the student container; (ii) 'moulder-shaper' of the inert student; (iii) 'nurturer-cultivator' of the developing student. Using Fox's method of categorising interview statements about his role, she produced a table for one teacher (See appendix C). From this it can be observed that at different times this teacher might be equally well categorised by any of the four distinctive styles. Therefore any attempt to</page><page sequence="8">CHOICE OF APPROACH Quantitative / I I INTUITIVE THEORIES ?

Teachers, like all people, are multi- faceted creatures, with a range of intuitive theories, displaying different styles depending on the perceived demands of the situation and their students at any given time. Given that there are no easy tabulations, no simplifying formulae into which to plug the results of data collection on intuitive theories, we are left with an uncomfortable conundrum. Miller Mair (1980) epitomises the emotions engendered by this confrontation, although describing a slightly different interview context: (You) feel alarm at the situation you are involved in and the distance you have travelled from easy public justification of what you are doing. This is where it is easy to abandon, betray and deny the special trust developing between you. The temptation can be great to rush back to public safety and recognisable ordinariness. (Mair, 1980) The Paradox In our current research we aim to present a full and frank description of intuitive theories. Must the choice be between tradition, tabulation, tidiness, and inappropri- ate application on the one hand and authenticity, complexity and possible lack of dissemination and utility on the other? Fig. 1 represents two possible routes in the investigation of intuitive theories (in our case with science). It can be seen that the routes may in fact converge if the researcher during the analysis phase retreats in the face of certain obstacles. For example, if one is concerned with a wide dissemination of ones results and that these are perceived as having practical utility one might feel that full portrayal of the complexity of events is inappropriate. Often the pressurised practitioner looks to tidy tabulation in traditional form for immediate application to own context. For instance, Denicolo could have produced a list of metaphors and analogies which proved useful for student understanding in science lessons given by teachers categorised as having different orientations to teaching. The original context, i.e. prior joint experiences, developed personal knowledge, mode of delivery, etc. could be omitted-but at what cost? In more general terms, the negative side of such a retreat is that if the complexity is ignored inappropriate applications of results might ensue. In addition one might question the authenticity of the reduced portrayal. Furthermore, a retreat as implied here into the quantitative paradigm, via extensive data reduction would entail reneging on the original aims and ethics of the hermeneutic approach we value. Herein lies a paradox and the researchers' dilemma. Correspondence: Dr Maureen Pope, Department of Educational Studies, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 5XH, England.

That is, they see energy to be associated mainly with human beings or treat objects as if they had human attributes. This is true at all ages though advanced students sometimes adopt the traditional 'third person passive' register of physics, they find it difficult to maintain. Considering the example of a person pushing a box up a hill, conversation would centre upon the person having energy but certainly not the box. Framework 2: A 'Depository' Model of Energy This model of energy is a 'source of force' model. From this point of view, youngsters see some objects as having energy (and being rechargeable), some as 'needing' energy (and simply expending what they get) and yet others as neutral (and whose activities are somehow 'normal' or 'natural'). Energy, then, is a casual agent, a source of activity based, or stored within certain objects. Framework 4: Energy is in 'Ostensive' Activity Too many, outward displays are the sole means of identifying energy, moreover are actually the energy themselves. Movement (of any kind) is widely given as a reason for energy being involved: the energy is the movement itself. This is often indicated in the responses by energy being equated with a verb, a word-of-action. This framework is similar to the everyday meaning of the word-as some kind of activity. It is not seen as the cause of the action, but the happening itself that is the energy. Framework 7: A Fluid-Transfer Model of Energy In this final major framework, energy is seen as something that can flow from object to object, or from one situation to another. It seems that it can either 'rub off from object to object, or flow through them in some fashion. It is often made synonymous with electricity.</page><page sequence="14">Appendix C: Personal Theories of Teaching Transfer Shaping Travelling Growing "break down the info into "develop their thinking" "passing on helpful "get enjoyment from them as simple units as possible" hints" developing their thinking" "you need facts to build "getting info over" and use concepts" "go through it with "encourage them" them" "build respect for the subject" "each needs a subtle variation of approach" "getting everyone to a "provide different certain level" experiences" "different students react "a bad result in differently to different "getting the students practical undoes all the "jolly them along" methods" through exams" things you've told them" "have a debate" "disseminating info" "you can't build "stimulate the students without bricks so "it is important to form into thinking" facts are important a relationship with students" "implant and develop understanding" "make them think it out" et fl</page></plain_text>
