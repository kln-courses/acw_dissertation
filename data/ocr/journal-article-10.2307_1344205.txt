<plain_text><page sequence="1">Benjamin and Cinema: Not a One-Way Street Miriam Bratu Hansen More than any other contemporary film practice, Hong Kong cinema seems to me to resonate with Benjamin's efforts to theorize mass- mediated modernity, with its twin etiologies of technical reproduction and capitalist consumption. To paraphrase Benjamin in the most general terms, these efforts concern the impact of the industrially altered envi- ronment on the human sensorium, the epochal restructuring of subjec- tivity and collectivity, the crisis of the aesthetic, and the conditions of possibility for postauratic forms of experience and memory, intersubjec- tivity and agency. Hong Kong films of the last decade, with the clock ticking toward the 1997 handover, reformulate these concerns for an age of digital, gene, and transplant technologies; of accelerated speed, esca- lated violence, and refined mechanisms of power; of globalized econo- mies and new, at once local and transnational, media publics. The most recent instance of such cinematic inquiry, Face/Off a Holly- wood production directed by emigrant director John Woo, raises the question of the fate of sense perception and personal identity to splen- didly nightmarish proportions.

Whatever you may think of this plot device, it effectively dramatizes the question of what it means to "trust your senses" in a world in which fundamental parameters of human appear- ance and character can be altered and simulated, in which experience (in Benjamin's emphatic sense) not only has lost its currency but instead is deployed to deceive-a world in which people are no longer capable, in Benjamin's words, "of telling ... proven friend... from mortal enemy."' While we might expect such concerns in a sci-fi inflected version of the gangster/killer film or, for that matter, in so many versions of the transnational action genre, they emerge more surprisingly in the suppos- edly softer genre of romantic comedy. The most successful Hong Kong film of 1996, Comrades: Almost a Love Story (Tianmimi, directed by Peter Chan), is an epic romance about two immigrants from the mainland, played by Maggie Cheung and local pop star Leon Lai. The process of acculturation, in particular the young man's, is staged through the old comic trope of the country rube encountering technological modernity- in this case, an advanced capitalist late modernity that is no longer centered in the West (in fact, New York, where both characters have emi- grated by 1993, is marked as backward and uncivilized compared to Hong Kong). The high-tech accoutrements of daily life, such as pagers, TV monitors, and video and audio cassettes, are ubiquitous, as are auto- matic teller machines,2 and economic activities range from the neighbor- hood food business through McDonald's to the stock market ("stocks and 1.

The overt catalyst for the formation of the romantic couple is Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Tang, with her eponymous song "Tianmimi," who is herself emblematic of the vicissitudes of an emerging pan-Asian culture industry. The catastrophic downside of romantic and economic success, how- ever, is embodied by a star of a different medium and period: Mickey Mouse.3 Reduced by the 1987 stockmarket collapse to earning her living as a massage girl, Qiao (Cheung), confronts a particularly intimidating client, gangster boss Pao (Eric Tsang). Since she is not afraid of any- thing-"only rats," as she replies to his taunts-he returns for the next session with, as he puts it, "a friend, heard you're afraid of him," and we get a close-up of a Mickey Mouse design tattooed on his already densely ornamented back. She refuses to laugh-except for an extra tip, as she explains in good Brechtian style-but Mickey becomes the mascot of her subsequent life with the gangster, who is further aligned with the Disney figure by way of his squat shape, violent energy, robustness, and basic kindness. The affinity of laughter and fear, as of laughter and horror (which Benjamin had pinpointed in the figures of Mickey Mouse and Charlie Chaplin), is reinforced toward the end of the film, after Pao has been killed in a scuffle with street kids in New York. Taken to the morgue to identify him, Qiao asks that he be turned over; the viewer, unlike the coroner, knows what she sees and why she smiles, even chuckles, only to break into violent sobbing, exacerbated by a slow zoom into her face. The reverse shot closing in on the tattoo may be redundant and excessive by Western (art-film) standards, but the emphatic gesture condenses in the figure of Mickey both the shock of real loss and the possibility of a happy ending. The inscribed skin that identifies the gangster's body, his corpse, becomes a screen for the recovery of sensory affect, suggesting in turn a film practice that might pierce the scar tissue formed in the adaptation to the regime of capitalist technology. "In the cinema," to quote Benjamin not quite out of context, "people whom nothing moves or touches any longer learn to cry again."4 Comrades ends happily, if barely so, moving us by a "sentimentality ... restored to health" of the kind that Benjamin perceived in 1920s commercial cinema and advertising, and it does not 3. In his 1989 Hong Kong feature The Killer, Woo paid hilarious homage to Disney by having the perversely paired cop and killer refer to each other as Mickey Mouse and Dumbo. In Chan's film, the romantic counterpart to Mickey Mouse is Hollywood icon Wil- liam Holden, whose image and memory are invoked as the elusive American dream, as it were, of the character of Rosie, the male protagonist's dying aunt. 4.

I am not trying to offer a Benjaminian reading of Hong Kong films (and do not claim expertise in that area), nor do I intend to impose a theoretical framework developed in relation to Western moder- nity onto cultural phenomena that are incommensurate. What I want to suggest, however, is that Benjamin's speculations speak to the concerns of these films, and vice versa, because the problems he articulated vis-A-vis film and mass culture and the antinomies in which his thinking moved persist today-in different forms and on a different scale, to be sure, but with no less urgency and no more hope for easy solutions. In this regard I share the emphasis on the antinomic structures in Benjamin's work that critics have discerned in various ways, following Benjamin's own observa- tion that his thinking, like his life, "moved by way of extreme positions."7 5.

Let me try to define this particular antinomy in Benjamin's thinking as succinctly as possible, at the risk of being reductive. Position A, devel- oped under the traumatic impact of World War I, welcomes the technical media--photography, film, gramophone, radio-because they promote the "liquidation" of the cultural heritage, of bourgeois-humanist notions of art, personality, and experience that have proved bankrupt in, if not complicit with, the military catastrophe and the economic one that fol- lowed, inadequate to the social and political reality of the proletarianized masses. At this historic crossing, Benjamin turns his back on the decaying "aura," which cannot be salvaged anyway, and tries to promote "a new, positive concept of barbarism" whose outlines he finds in the contem- porary "culture of glass" (Loos, Le Corbusier, Klee, Scheerbart).'0 This presentist, collectivist, "liquidationist" position (WBA, p. 9), which is com- monly taken to be the message of his famous essay, "The Artwork in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility" (1935-36), has by and large domi- nated Benjamin's reception in cinema and media studies, from Brechtian film theory of the 1970s to more recent cultural studies. Position B, formulated under the shadow of the rise of fascism and the "coming war,"" which Benjamin foresaw in 1933, and largely to be found in his essays on Baudelaire, Proust, and Leskov, laments the de- cline of experience, synonymous with "the disintegration of the aura in the experience of shock.""12 The decline of experience, "Erfahrung" in Benjamin's emphatic sense, is inseparable from that of memory, as the faculty that connects sense perceptions of the present with those of the past and thus enables us to remember both past sufferings and forgotten futures.'"

Further- more, by vastly expanding the archive of voluntary memory or conscious recollection, the technical media restrict the play of involuntary memory or remembrance. What is lost in this process is not merely the peculiar structure of auratic experience, that of investing the phenomenon we ex- perience with the ability to return the gaze, a potentially destabilizing encounter with otherness; what is also lost is the element of temporal dis- junction in this experience, the intrusion of a forgotten past that disrupts the fictitious progress of chronological time. But Benjamin's positions on film and mass-mediated modernity can- not be reduced to the antinomy of "liquidationist" versus "culturally con- servative" (McCole), nor to the antinomic opposition of "distraction" and "destruction" (Gillian Rose) (WBA, p. 9).14 For both positions hook into each other in ways that may generate a dialectic, but may just as well turn into a mise-en-abime. The problem Benjamin recognized is that each position contains within itself another antinomic structure whose ele- ments combine with those of its opposite in more, or hopefully less, destructive ways. The most destructive combination was at that point pioneered by fascism, while the alternative possibilities were increasingly polarized between the liberal capitalist media and the cultural politics of Stalinism. Let me elaborate this point by way of the logic of "aesthetics and anaesthetics," which Susan Buck-Morss has pinpointed as the linchpin of what Benjamin means by "politics" in the artwork essay. Specifically, Buck-Morss links Benjamin's pessimistic adaptation of Freud's concept of shock in the 1939 Baudelaire essay, with its emphasis on the defensive numbing of the sensorium, to his polemics against "the aestheticization of politics" in the artwork essay, his somewhat curious assertion that the fascist spectacularization of the masses and of war consummates the tra- 1972): 7; "Kleine Geschichte der Photographie," Gesammelte Schriften, 2:1:371.

Debbie Keates, in Walter Benjamin's Philosophy, pp. 32-58.</page><page sequence="7">312 Miriam Bratu Hansen Benjamin and Cinema dition of 'Tart pour l'art."'15 What makes this link compelling, according to Buck-Morss, is a dialectical relation between anaesthetization, the numbing that splits momentary perception from experience (synaesthetics, mem- ory), and phantasmagoria, the deployment of ever more powerful aesthetic techniques, ever more spectacular thrills and sensations, to pierce the protective shield of consciousness, yet only momentarily and on isolated occasions that distill auratic effects into a kind of false sublime (world fairs, wax museums, Wagner). As a result of such overstimulation, experi- ential numbing is aggravated to a degree of "self-alienation" that makes humanity "experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order" ("K," 7:1:384). In terms of the antinomic structure of Benja- min's thinking, this means that in the fascist mass spectacles and glorifi- cation of war, the negative poles of both positions outlined above, the anachronistic perpetuation of the aura in position A and the anaesthetiz- ing effects of technology in position B, combine to enter into the most fatal, violent, and destructive constellation. The key to the politics of the artwork essay, in Buck-Morss's analysis, is that Benjamin casts his critique of the aesthetic tradition, the aesthetic narrowly understood as pertaining to the bourgeois institution of art, which turns on the category of autonomy, within the larger project of the aesthetic more broadly understood as the "theory [Lehre] of perception that the Greeks called aesthetics," which pertains to the entire domain of hu- man perception and sensation ("K," 7:1:381). At this point in history, Ben- jamin warns fellow intellectuals, the aesthetic can no longer be defended in terms of the idealist values of the few that make it complicit with the suffering of the many, nor even in terms of style and artistic technique; rather, the political crisis demands an understanding of the aesthetic that takes into account the social reception of technology, the effects of sensory alienation on the conditions of experience and agency. And it is at this juncture that Benjamin locates the historic function of film: "to establish a balance between humans and technology" ("K," 7:1:375), "to make the vast technical apparatus of our time an object of human innervation."'6 The cinema emerges as the foremost battleground of contemporary art and aesthetics, not because of a futurist or constructivist enthusiasm for technology, but because film is the only medium that might yet counter the catastrophic effects of humanity's (already) "miscarried [verungliickte] reception of technology" that had come to a head with World War 1.17 15.

The crucial issue is therefore whether there can be an imbrication of technology and the hu- man senses that is not swallowed into this vortex of decline; whether Ben- jamin's egalitarian, techno-utopian politics could be conjoined with his emphatic notion of experience/memory; whether and how the "profane illumination" he discerned in the project of the surrealists could be gen- eralized into a "bodily collective innervation," the universal and public integration of body- and image-space (Leib- und Bildraum) that had be- come structurally possible with technology.'8 If that possibility amounts to nothing less than the revolution, troped in at once messianic and an- thropological-materialist terms, its weak version is the more pragmatic option of a "general and mild politics of distraction," as Rose puts it, which Benjamin appears to endorse in the artwork essay.19 This second option, however, willingly puts up with the loss of experience/memory entailed by the technological media and thus risks underwriting its anaes- thetizing opposite, that is, a new barbarism that, as Adorno cautioned Benjamin more than once, comes close to identifying with the aggressor."0 If there is a key term in Benjamin's efforts to imagine an alternative reception of technology, it is the concept of innervation. Related to the notion of an optical unconscious familiar from the artwork essay, innerva- tion refers, broadly, to a neurophysiological process that mediates between internal and external, psychic and motoric, human and mechanical regis- ters.

The latter project was to bring the new cycle of work to a close "in much the same way in which the Trauerspiel book con- cluded the German cycle."22 Benjamin never completed his arcades proj- ect and did not return to it until 1934, but during the hiatus of the late 1920s, and early 1930s, he wrote a number of texts that are more impor- tant to film and media theory today than even the most thorough reading of the artwork essay.23 In addition to "One-Way Street" (and the few pieces specifically devoted to film and photography), these texts include the essays on surrealism and on Proust and Kafka, the speculations on the mimetic faculty, the texts on (Berlin) childhood, "Hashish in Mar- seilles" and other Denkbilder, and the programmatic piece "Experience and Poverty," as well as the early layers of the Passagen-Arbeit.24 If the Ger- manist cycle of production remained largely within the genres of literary history and criticism, shot through with metaphysical and theological concerns, the new cycle took on the question of modernity in its profane actuality, having to do with the impact of industrial-capitalist technology and commodity production, with the emergence of mass society and the resulting political crisis. "One-Way Street" is commonly understood as documenting Benja- min's turn to Marxism, under the influence of Asja Lacis, the "engineer" who, as he puts it in his dedication to her, "cut it [the street] through the author" ("OW," p. 444; "E," 4:1:83). But the work is also part of a more 21. My references to the artwork essay here are largely to the second version, which was Benjamin's first typed and, for him, definitive version.

Adorno's letter of 18 March 1936 responds to-and contains references that only make sense in relation to-this version. The English version of the essay that appears in Illuminations not only suffers from an unreliable translation but also is based on the most compromised Ger- man version of the essay, as edited by Adorno and Friedrich Podszus and first published in 1955. 22.

"Access to truth is now in the pro- fane," was Siegfried Kracauer's parting shot in his 1926 polemic against Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig's translation of the Bible.25 The con- cern with "actuality," shared, though understood differently, by Benja- min, Kracauer, and Ernst Bloch, shaped their reception of Marx in idiosyncratic ways.26 More than either of his interlocutors, however, Ben- jamin focused on the question of technology; and, more than they, he sharpened his approach to modernity with recourse to psychoanalysis, including the neurological, anthropological, and surrealist fringes of Freud. This twin orientation marks "One-Way Street" not only in its the- matic and analytic concerns but also in its avant-garde mode of presen- tation (which Bloch somewhat glibly heralded as the "revue form in philosophy"),27 in textual strategies that articulate-or, as it were, "inner- vate"-the political, erotic, and aesthetic implications of the Bahnung or pathway cut by modernity, the street that entwines technological and psy- chic registers in the book's title trope. If Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis feel compelled to say that "the term 'innervation' may pose a problem for the reader of Freud," one can only wonder what they would say about Benjamin's use of the term. Ac- cording to Laplanche and Pontalis, in Freud's earliest writings the term refers to a "physiological process: the transmission, generally in an effer- ent direction, of energy along a nerve-pathway."28 This definition by and large tallies with the term's usage in the discourse of physiology since the 25.

But instead of effecting a normal functioning of the organism, innervation in the hysteric facilitates a pathway related to the "traumatic experience" (which itself is repressed); excitation is "forced into a wrong channel (into somatic innervation)," which, as a "mnemic symbol," remains other and strange, lodged "in consciousness, like a sort of parasite" ("NP," 3:49, 50, 49, 50).3' In The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), innervation appears in the more general, "structural" sense, though with a significant twist. In his discus- sion of the "psychical apparatus" as a composite instrument comparable to various systems of lenses used in optical devices, Freud again asserts that the psychic apparatus has a definite direction: All our psychical activity starts from stimuli (whether internal or exter- nal) and ends in innervations. Accordingly, we shall ascribe a sensory and a motor end to the apparatus. At the sensory end there lies a system which receives perceptions; at the motor end there lies an- other, which opens the gateway to motor activity. Psychical processes advance in general from the perceptual end to the motor end.32 While in the context of the studies on hysteria innervation represents a response to an internal excitation (whatever traumatic experience may have caused the excitation), here the sources of stimulation also include external ones. Freud resumes this distinction, along with the model of the psychic apparatus, in "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" (1920), when he discusses the case of traumatic neurosis caused by sensory overstimula- tion through mechanical violence (most acutely, in the recent war)- which returns us to Benjamin's account of the decay of experience under the urban-industrial-military proliferation of shock. In Freud's specula- tion, traumatic neurosis does not simply result from a thickening of the protective shield against excessive stimuli (Reizschutz), but from an "exten- sive breach being made in the protective shield," to which the psyche responds by summoning massive amounts of "cathectic energy" around 29.

Whether Benjamin borrowed the term from Freud or from the neu- rophysiological and psychological discourse of the period, innervation comes to function as an antidote-and counterconcept-to technologi- cally multiplied shock and its anaesthetizing economy. In Buck-Morss's words, "'innervation' is Benjamin's term for a mimetic reception of the external world, one that is empowering, in contrast to a defensive mi- metic adaptation that protects at the price of paralyzing the organism, robbing it of its capacity of imagination, and therefore of active re- sponse."34 To imagine such an enabling reception of technology, it is es- sential that Benjamin, unlike Freud, understood innervation as a two-way process, that is, not only a conversion of mental, affective energy into somatic, motoric form, but also the possibility of reconverting, and recov- ering, split-off psychic energy through motoric stimulation (as distinct from the talking cure advocated by Freud and Breuer).35 This possibility would make the protective shield against stimuli, the precarious bound- ary or rind of the bodily ego, a bit less of a carapace or armor and a bit more of a matrix or medium-a porous interface between the organism and the world that would allow for a greater mobility and circulation of psychic energies. Imagined as a two-way process, Benjamin's concept of innervation may have less in common with Freudian psychoanalysis than with con- temporary perceptual psychology, reception aesthetics, and acting theory, in particular the Soviet avant-garde discourse of biomechanics that may have reached Benjamin through Lacis. A major reference point in this regard is Sergey Eisenstein who, drawing on and revising William James and the conservative philosopher Ludwig Klages (the latter an important influence/irritant for Benjamin), sought to theorize the conditions of transmitting or, more precisely, producing emotion in the beholder through bodily movement.36 Seeking to adapt Klages's (metaphysically 33.

Freud, too, speaks of a "conversion in the opposite direction" but assumes that such a conversion, as pursued by Breuer, would be effected "by means of thought-activity and a discharge of the excitation by talking" ("NP," 3:49, 50). 36.

In "One-Way Street," the term innervation appears only twice, but the idea or concept pervades the text in a series of variations, culminating in the grand finale of the book, "To the Planetarium." In the two places where the term is used explicitly it involves two distinct senses of Technik, technique and technology, in one case referring to the practice of yoga meditation, in the other to the tools of writing. In the section labelled "Antiques," under the subheading "Prayer Wheel," Benjamin states axi- omatically: "No imagination without innervation."

James's critique of Wundt's category of "Innervationsgefiihl" (1880) is directed not against the concept of innervation as such but against the idealist notion of innervation being coupled with, and depending upon, a sentient, conscious "feeling" rather than the physiological fact of "discharge into the motor nerves" (PP, p. 1105).

The following sentences exem- plify the connection between imagination and innervation in terms of an at once bodily and spiritual practice: the discipline of breathing in yoga meditation. "Now breathing," Benjamin states just as tersely, is "[in- nervation's] most delicate regulator." And the sound of the formulas, he goes on, is "a canon of such breathing.""9 Inverting the traditional West- ern clich6 that associates the Buddhist prayer wheel with mindless me- chanicity, Benjamin sees in the ascetic integration of external rhythm, physical posture, and mental processes a source of the imagination and, therefore, of power. "Hence [the yogis'] omnipotence [Allmacht]," he con- cludes-which, like a prayer wheel, returns the reader to the initial sen- tence on the vitalness of the pictorial imagination to the force of the will ("OW," p. 466; "E," 4:1:117). If yoga meditation provides a model of imaginative innervation, it can only do so under the heading "Antiques."40 Its imbrication of physical and mental energy harks back to a ritualistic, premechanical conception of the technical that Benjamin sought to theorize, in the early versions of the artwork essay, with his distinction between a first and second technol- ogy (erste und zweite Technik), as part of his effort to redefine the relation- ship between aesthetic technique and industrial technology (see "K, 7:1:359-60).4' This distinction revolves around the human body and the degree of its implication: "the first technology involves the human being as much, the second as little as possible" ("K," 7:1:359). The second tech- nology originates as "man attempts, with unconscious cunning, to gain distance from nature" (a motif that Max Horkheimer and Adorno were to elaborate in their historico-philosophical reading of the Odyssey, but that also recalls Ernst Jiinger's reflections in his famous essay on pain) ("K," 7:1:359).42 As Benjamin explains, "the greatest feat of the first tech- 39. In a fragment of 1929-30, "Notizen zu einer Theorie des Spiels" (Notes toward a Theory of Gambling), Benjamin parenthetically equates the term "motoric innervation" with "inspiration," foregrounding the etymological connection between inspiration and breathing (Benjamin, "Notizen zu einer Theorie des Spiels," Gesammelte Schriften, 6:189). 40. Both the appeal and the anachronism of the recourse to yoga practices in Western modernity are registered by Freud in a sarcastic comment in Civilization and Its Discontents (1929-30), Standard Edition, 21:72-73. 41.

Yet, where a contemporary reader might prolong this line into the Gulf War, Benjamin makes an amazing turn: "in other words," he con- tinues the speculation on the second technology's constitution through distance, its origin "lies in play [im Spiel]" ("K," 7:1:359). Unlike Frankfurt school critiques of technology from Dialectic of En- lightenment through the work of Jiirgen Habermas, Benjamin does not assume an instrumentalist trajectory from mythical cunning to capitalist- industrialist modernity. The telos of Naturbeherrschung or "domination of nature" defines the second, modern technology only "from the position of the first," which sought to master nature in existential seriousness, out of harsh necessity. By contrast, Benjamin asserts, "the second technology rather aims at the interplay [Zusammenspiel] between nature and human- ity" ("K," 7:1:359).43 And it is the training, practicing, or rehearsal (Einii- bung) of this interplay that Benjamin pinpoints as the decisive function of contemporary art, in particular film. Film assumes this task not simply by way of a behaviorist adaptation of human perceptions and reactions to the regime of the apparatus (which seems to be the tenor of parts of the artwork essay) but because film has the potential to reverse, in the form of play, the catastrophic consequences of an already failed reception of technology. For instead of providing humans with a "key to happiness," technology, in its capitalist-imperialist usage, had become a tool for the domination of nature and thus of humanity's (self-) destruction; bour- geois culture had been complicit with that process by disavowing the po- litical implications of technology, treating it as "second nature," while fetishizing an ostensibly pure and primary nature as the object of individ- ual contemplation.44 Because of the medium's technicity, as well as its col- lective mode of reception, film offers a chance-a second chance, a last 43. See also the section "To the Planetarium," "OW," p. 487; "E," 4:1:147. The empha- sis on play and interplay, that is, on both ludic and ecological possibilities, in Benjamin's notion of second technology, is key to his critique of fascism. Against Nazi efforts "to fold second nature back into the first (blood and soil)," it is necessary "to accentuate the ludic aspects [Spielform] of second nature: to oppose the serenity [Heiterkeit] of communism to the beastly seriousness of fascism" (Benjamin, draft notes for the first version of the artwork essay, Gesammelte Schriften, 1:3:1045). 44. The notion of technology as a "key to happiness" rather than a "fetish of doom" appears in Benjamin's "Theories of German Fascism," a text that represents an important, if problematic, relay between Benjamin's speculations on technology in "One-Way Street," especially in "To the Planetarium," and the respective passages in the artwork essay (Benja- min, "Theories of German Fascism," p. 128; "Theorien des Deutschen Faschismus," 3:250); on the upsurge of the "German feeling for nature" in the context of World War I, see ibid., p. 126, 3:247.

"To make the technical apparatus of our time, which is a second nature for the individual, into a first nature for the collective, is the historic task of film" (notes to "K," 7:2:688). Innervation as a mode of regulating the interplay between humans and (second) technology can only succeed (that is, escape the destructive vortex of defensive, numbing adaptation) if it reconnects with the dis- carded powers of the first, with mimetic practices that involve the body, as the "preeminent instrument" of sensory perception and (moral and political) differentiation.45 Where Juinger turns his equally astute obser- vations on the impact of technology into a paean to anaesthetization, self-alienation, and discipline (celebrating a "second and colder con- sciousness" capable of seeing its own body as object), Benjamin seeks to reactivate the abilities of the body as a medium in the service of imagining new forms of subjectivity.46 For Benjamin, negotiating the historical con- frontation between human sensorium and technology as an alien, and alienating, regime requires learning from forms of bodily innervation that are no less technical but to a greater extent self-regulated (which ties in with Benjamin's autoexperiments with hashish, gambling, running downhill, eroticism). Hence, when (in the second version of the artwork essay) he speaks of revolutions as "innervations of the collective," he speci- fies, "more precisely, efforts of innervation on the part of a new, histori- cally unprecedented collective which has its organs in second technology." And he goes on to illustrate the utopian excess of such innervation with re- course to developmental psychology: the child learns to grasp "by reach- ing for the moon the same way she or he reaches for a ball" ("K," 7:1:360 n. 4; emphasis mine).47 This crossing of political history and the history 45.

What breaks through-and is as soon marginalized-in modern revolutions, he ob- serves in a footnote, is a "double utopian will": alongside the "utopias of second nature," concerning society and technology (the Soviet experi- ment), there emerge the "utopias of the first," concerning in particular the "bodily organism of the human individual" and its repressed "existen- tial questions [Lebensfragen]," "love and death" (Fourier, de Sade) ("K," 7:1:360, 7:2:665, 666). The concept of innervation, then, has to be seen in the context of Benjamin's speculations on "natural history" (Naturgeschichte), as bridging not only aspects of the first and the second technology but also the gap between human history and a history that encompasses all of creation (Kreatur) in its transience and contingency, including mutations of the physis caused/enabled by technology.48 In Benjamin's messianically in- flected science-fiction scenario, technology not only transforms but has the capacity to redress the discrepancies of human existence in (to some extent, Western) history. These discrepancies include, in particular, the perceptual limitations constitutive of the human being qua individual Hangs the moon.

See, for instance, the last of Benjamin's "Theses on the Philosophy of History": "In relation to the history of organic life on earth," writes a modern biologist, "the paltry fifty millennia of homo sapiens constitute something like two seconds at the close of a twenty-four-hour day. On this scale, the history of civilized mankind would fill one-fifth of the last second of the last hour." The present, which, as a model of Messi- anic time, comprises the history of the entire species in a gigantic abridgment, coin- cides exactly with that figure which the history of mankind cuts in the universe.

It is from the perspective of this "negative" or "refracted anthropol- ogy," as Gertrud Koch calls it, that Benjamin's utopian-and by the 1930s largely counterfactual-overvaluation of the radical potential of film has to be understood.50 As Koch compellingly argues, film appeared as the one medium capable of overcoming the physiological, historical, and ideological limitations of the human body. As a prosthetic extension of our perception that gives us a more complete vision of ourselves (through variable framing and editing), the camera, for Benjamin, assumes "Messianic-prophetic power," making the cinema a "technical apparatus which permits one to forget anthropological lack."'' Furthermore, the cinema has spawned creations, like Mickey Mouse, that unhinge experi- ence and agency from anthropomorphic identity and thus resume Four- ier's project of "cracking the teleology of nature" (PW, 5:2:781 [Konvolut W 8 a, 5]).52 Finally, the cinema provides a structural equivalent to the radical integration of "image space" and "body space" that Benjamin dis- cerned in the experiments of the surrealists, projecting a "world of uni- versal and integral actuality," but one that, in the case of cinema, is institutionally, qua mode of reception, predicated upon the sensorium of a collective ("SLS," pp. 191-92; "SLM," 2:1:309; trans. mod.). Benjamin is well aware that the "leap into the apparatus," effected by the collapsing of "body- and image-space,"53 is itself an image, just as the lap dissolve from human physiognomy to alarm clock (at the end of 49.

To a degree, therefore, innervation is necessar- ily based on miscognition, constituted within the register of the Imagi- nary (in Lacan's sense): the child will never succeed in grasping the moon. But from this miscognition arise creative and transformative energies (different from the Lacanian scenario), in art as well as politics. Whether the relation with technology will be transformative and co- operative (or, at the very least, benign) or whether it will continue on its destructive course turns on the classical polarity of "semblance and play" (Schein und Spiel) that Benjamin traces back, past Goethe and Schiller, to ancient practices of mimesis. Since the oldest forms of imitation, "language and dance," knew only one material of creation, the imitator's body, sem- blance and play were two sides of the same process, still folded into one another: "The person imitating makes a thing apparent [macht eine Sache scheinbar]. One could also say, he plays [or performs] the thing [er spielt die Sache]: Thus one touches on the polarity that rests at the basis of mime- sis." In Benjamin's genealogy of art, this polarity has been tipped toward semblance, autonomized in the Western tradition of "beautiful semblance" (schoner Schein), which has dead-ended in aestheticism (illusion, phantas- magoria, aura in the narrow sense).54 Play, by contrast, is linked to repeti- tion and iterability, as both an internal principle and the modality of imagining a second chance, the hope of sidetracking a catastrophic his- tory. This is why Benjamin conceives of second technology not only in terms of its destructive, anaesthetic trajectory but also, and significantly, as grounded in a ludic and performative impulse. A mimetic innervation of technology would counter the perpetuation of illusion promoted by fascism with an aesthetics of play, an imagination that plays games-but also, to invoke Kracauer, gambles-with technology's otherness.55 54.

The affinity of photography with chance and material contingency (versus narrative, dramatic "fate") is crucial to Kracauer's Theory of Film (1960), especially the early drafts written in Marseille following Benjamin's suicide; see Hansen, "'With Skin and Hair': Kracauer's Theory of Film, Marseille 1940," Critical Inquiry 19 (Spring 1993): 437-69.</page><page sequence="20">Critical Inquiry Winter 1999 325 As my excursion into Benjamin's speculations on first and second technology should have made clear, these speculations cannot be easily assimilated to contemporary media theory, certainly not the teleological variant (for example, in Paul Virilio, Friedrich Kittler, or Norbert Bolz) that marshalls a vast number of sources to demonstrate-celebrate or decry-the subject's inevitable abdication to the a priori regime of the ap- paratus.56 While Benjamin no doubt participates in the critique of West- ern bourgeois conceptions of the subject, beginning with Nietzsche, he would hardly have reduced "the subjective factor" to an element in a loop that processes information and sensory signals. On the contrary, the very impulse to theorize technology is part of his project to reimagine the aes- thetic-in reponse to the technically changed sensorium, to be sure, but in a desperate effort to reassess, and redefine, the conditions of experi- ence, affectivity, memory, and the imagination. By the same token, how- ever, we should guard against reading Benjamin too optimistically as assuming that the anaesthetization and alienation wreaked by technology on the human sensorium could be overcome, that "the instinctual power of the human bodily senses" could be "restore[d]" 'for the sake of humanity's self- preservation," and that this could be done, "not by avoiding the new tech- nologies, but by passing through them."57 For Benjamin there is no beyond or outside of technology, neither in immanent political practice, nor even in his visions of messianic reconstitution. There is no way he would con- ceive of a restoration of the instinctual power of the senses and their in- tegrity that would not take into account the extent to which the apparatus has already become part of human subjectivity; and there is no strategy for preventing humanity's self-destruction in which technology would not play an essential role. It is because Benjamin so clearly recognizes the irre- versibility of the historical process, the second fall that is modernity, that he pursues a "politicization of art" in terms of a "collective innervation of technology," rather than a restoration of the sensorium to an instinctually intact, natural state. The issue is not how to reverse the historical process but how to mobilize, recirculate, and rechannel its effects. To return to "One-Way Street," the philosophy of technology that subtends the artwork essay emerges, in outline, in the trajectory from reflections on techniques of the individual body, particularly in the sec- tion "Madame Ariane: Second Courtyard on the Left," to the book's con- 56.

If the former suggests a productive recourse to first technology through the category of a "bodily presence of mind," the latter presents a short-circuiting of bodies and (second) tech- nology on a grand scale, on the battlefields of World War I. Generically another "antique," "Madame Ariane" contrasts modern forms of proph- ecy and superstition with ancient practices that had in the naked body their "most reliable instrument of divination" (Benjamin's often quoted example here is Scipio's gesture of throwing himself on the Carthagin- ian soil and exclaiming, "'teneo te, terra Africana!"') ("OW," p. 483; "E," 4:1:142).58 What makes this example appear more relevant to the con- temporary crisis than that of the "Prayer Wheel" is that it defines "pres- ence of mind" as the key to averting danger, "to turn the threatening future into a fulfilled 'now"'; in other words, it reminds us that "precise awareness of the present moment" is the very condition of possibility of effective agency ("OW," pp. 482, 483, 482; "E," 4:1:141, 142, 141). The other proleptic strand in "Madame Ariane" is thrown into relief at the end of the book, with Benjamin's disturbing mise-en-scene of World War I as an ecstatic, collective communion with the cosmos, "an attempt at new and unprecedented mating [Vermdhlung] with the cosmic powers" ("OW," p. 486; "E," 4:1:147; trans. mod.). The provocative link between these two kinds of bodily communion is his implicit invocation of Klages, whose treatise On the Cosmogonic Eros (1918) ostensibly dealt with the erotic, ecstatic, and mystical practices of antiquity but strongly resonated with the ideologies that had fuelled German (intellectuals') enthusiasm for the war.59 In a language barely less pornographic than Klages's, Ben- jamin takes up the cosmic mating fantasy but radicalizes and detonates it through the very term that Klages, like other proponents of Lebensphiloso- phie, had disavowed and opposed: technology. Human multitudes, gases, electrical forces were hurled into the open country, high-frequency currents coursed through the landscape, new constellations rose in the sky, aerial space and ocean depths thundered with propellers, and everywhere sacrificial shafts were 58. Scipio's exclamation puts this gesture into closer vicinity with a modern history of colonialism and imperialism than Benjamin might have intended. On a similarly repressed ambivalence toward that history, see John Kraniauskas, "Beware Mexican Ruins! 'One-Way Street' and the Colonial Unconscious," in Walter Benjamin's Philosophy, pp. 139-54. 59. See Ludwig Klages, Vom kosmogonischen Eros, in Philosophische Schriften, vol. 3 of Samtliche Werke, ed. Ernst Frauchiger et al. (Bonn, 1974), pp. 353-497. Klages emerges as a significant influence on Benjamin himself, particularly his phenomenology of dreaming and waking (a key motif in Das Passagen-Werk) and the temporal inflection of distance and nearness as key terms in the transformation of sensory-somatic perception (compare Benja- min's concepts of aura, masses, and kitsch). In "Outline of the Psychophysical Problem," p. 398, Benjamin lists Klages's essay on dream consciousness, "Vom TraumbewuBtsein" (1919), Philosophische Schriften, pp. 155-238, but not Vom kosmogonischen Eros, the more spe- cific source on distance and nearness; see esp. chaps. 4 and 5, pp. 410-41.</page><page sequence="22">Critical Inquiry Winter 1999 327 dug into Mother Earth. This immense wooing of the cosmos was enacted for the first time on a planetary scale-that is, in the spirit of technology. ["OW," pp. 486-87; "E," 4:1:147] Instead of scapegoating technology as such, Benjamin shifts his critique to the capitalist and imperialist harnessing of technology for the purpose of mastering nature. And it is here that he begins to sketch an alternative relationship with both nature and technology predicated on pedagogy (as a discipline ordering intergenerational relations rather than one of mastering children), which points to the politics/aesthetics of interplay and innervation developed in the artwork essay. As in the later text, Benjamin's critique of capitalist-imperialist tech- nology by and large elaborates the Marxian axiom that the productive relations which keep the productive forces fettered also, by propelling the development of those forces, produce the conditions for their own abolition;60 the subject of this process would be a collective that organizes its relations with both nature and technology in different ways than through "nations and families" ("OW," p. 487; "E," 4:1:147). What is more astounding, however, is that Benjamin phrases even the alternative re- ception of technology in the language of ecstasy, cosmic communion, and orgasmic convulsion, an affective terrain more typically occupied by the enemy. The "moderns" who dismiss this kind of experience as individual rapture commit a "dangerous error," he argues, because the desire for ecstatic communion with the cosmos is not only real and powerful but is, above all, communal and ultimately therapeutic ("OW," p. 486; "E," 4:1:147; trans. mod.). "The 'Lunaparks' are a prefiguration of sanatoria" ("OW," p. 487; "E," 4:1:147). Bringing the new collective physis enabled/ projected by technology under control may demand as violent a "parox- ysm of genuine cosmic experience" as the mass destruction that brought it into recognition in all its negativity, that is, as the historic failure of innervation whose repetition has to be prevented at all cost. Having opened the Pandora's box of therapeutic violence, Benjamin tries to close it again by handing the key to the proletariat, whose power is "the mea- sure of [the new body's] convalescence." It is no coincidence, then, that the proletarian "discipline," which has to grip the new physis "to the very marrow," is cast in phallic, heterosexual terms: "Living substance [Leben- diges] conquers the frenzy of destruction only in the ecstasy of procre- ation" ("OW," p. 487; "E," 4:1:148). It is hard to think of a smooth transition from this scene of Thewelei- tian male fantasy to the cultural politics of the late Weimar Republic. It 60. This argument appears in all versions of the artwork essay; see Benjamin, preface to "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Illuminations, pp. 217-18. Benjamin further elaborates his critique of capitalist-imperialist technology in "Theories of German Fascism" and, specifically in view of contemporary fascist aesthetics, in "Pariser Brief (I): Andre Gide und sein neuer Gegner" (1936), Gesammelte Schriften, 3:482-95.</page><page sequence="23">328 Miriam Bratu Hansen Benjamin and Cinema is not surprising that Benjamin pursues the question of collective in- nervation by turning to surrealism, a movement whose publications and activities he sums up as revolving around the project of "'[winning] the energies of intoxication [or ecstatic trance, Rausch] for the revolution'" ("SLS," p. 190; "SLM," 2:1:307). (In fact, where "To the Planetarium" goes beyond the vitalistic bombast reminiscent of Klages-as in its refer- ence to Lunaparks, or in phrases such as "in the nights of annihilation of the last war, the frame of mankind was shaken by a feeling that resembled the bliss of the epileptic"-the language seems closer to the archive of surrealism, in particular Bataille and Artaud ["OW," p. 487; "E," 4:1:148].) To imagine a collective innervation of technology in the Ger- man context, and not as a "last," or latest, "snapshot of the European intelligentsia" (the subtitle of the 1929 surrealism essay) but on a wider social basis, was likely to be a more problematic enterprise for Benjamin; there was no clear and direct path from that utopian snapshot to the cinema. For the collective assembled in the movie theaters was hardly that of the heroic proletariat (not an empirical category to begin with); rather, the cinema audience was in tendency part of "the mass," the blind, instinctual, insensible, self-destructive formation that Benjamin had de- nounced in an earlier, more pessimistic, section of "One-Way Street."'' But perhaps the question of how the cinema figures in Benjamin's effort to theorize an alternative reception of technology requires opening up the framework of his philosophy of natural history and anthropologi- cal materialism to include economic and social processes not entirely syn- chronized with the logics of technology. For the leap into the apparatus, enabled by and rehearsed in the cinema, also entailed a leap into the capitalist market, into the world of commodities, into mass consumption. It is significant that Benjamin did not reserve the concept of innervation for Soviet film, though Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov no doubt helped him confront, to some extent, the problem of reconciling utopian claims with the actual possibilities-and limitations-of contemporary film culture. Rather, he discerned specifically cinematic forms of innervation in two 61. See the section "Imperial Panorama: A Tour Through the German Inflation," "OW," p. 451; "E," 4:1:95-96. In a long note to the second version of the artwork essay, Benjamin takes up this pessimistic discourse with explicit reference to Gustave LeBon and mass psychology, as he contrasts the "compact mass" of the petit bourgeoisie, defined by "panic-prone" behavior such as militarism, anti-Semitism, and blind striving for survival, with the "proletarian mass" ("K," 7:1:370 n. 12). The latter in fact, Benjamin argues, ceases to be a mass in the LeBonian sense in the measure that it is infused with class consciousness and solidarity. Ultimately, the proletariat "works toward a society in which both the objective and the subjective conditions for the formation of masses no longer exist" ("K," 7:1:371 n. 12.).

In the following, I will take up the concept of innervation as it relates to industrial-capitalist commodity production and mass/ market culture, in particular the experience of a new relationship with "things" and with it the possibility of new forms of mimetic practice. This perspective not only foregrounds specifically modern forms of sensory perception, affectivity, and temporality; it also brings into view new modes of writing, reading, and reflexivity. Complicating Benjamin's focus on technology with his equally intense interest in the collective phenome- nology of commodity culture will allow us, in conclusion, to bring the concept of innervation to bear on the more familiar, though highly elu- sive and underexplored, notion of the optical unconscious. As already suggested, the possibility of collective innervation is bound up with the fate of the "mimetic faculty," the capacity to relate to the external world through patterns of similitude, affinity, reciprocity, and interplay. Like other writers reviving the concept of mimesis (such as Roger Caillois and Adorno), Benjamin takes up the anthropological, paleontological, zoological, and language-theoretical strands in the tradi- tion, rather than the aesthetic strand more narrowly understood as per- taining to works of art and standards of verisimilitude.62 (In fact, as we saw with his speculations on the polarity of "semblance and play," it is the very dissociation of these strands, the monumentalization of the aesthetic and its isolation from social experience, that motivates Benjamin's re- course to a more comprehensive concept of mimesis in the first place.) Beyond naturalist or realist norms of representation and a particular re- lation (copy, reflection, semblance) of the representation to reality, the mimetic is invoked as a form of practice that transcends the traditional subject-object dichotomy and its technologically exacerbated splittings of experience and agency-a process, activity, or procedure, whether ritual, performance, or play, of "producing similitudes"; a mode of cognition involving sensuous, somatic, and tactile forms of perception; a noncoer- cive engagement with the other that opens the self to experience, but 62.

Benjamin seems, for the most part, well aware of the concept's historicity and resists idealizing mimetic experience as a kind of Edenic merging. More impor- tant, his inquiry is framed by the possibility of a resurgence of mimetic powers within the disenchanted modern world: "The question is whether we are concerned with the decay of this faculty or with its transformation" ("OM," p. 334; "UM," 2:1:211). One major area in which this question poses itself is language, in particular written language, which he calls an archive, "our most complete archive," of "nonsensuous similitudes, non- sensuous correspondences" ("OM," pp. 336, 335; "UM," 2:1:213; trans. mod.); that is, the mimetic qualities of script and reading are not obvious or commonplace, but hidden, encrypted, hinging (as in astrology) on a past conjuncture, a lost indexical bond. With the emergence of new tech- nologies of inscription such as photography and film, however, this ar- chive not only is vastly expanded but the new modes of inscription have significantly altered the terms under which mimetic relations can be actu- alized-possibilities Benjamin designates with the shorthand of the opti- cal unconscious. The other area in which Benjamin discerns at once a persistence, albeit diminishing, and a historical transformation of the mimetic faculty is childhood-the ways in which children perceive, organize, and interact with their environment. "A child plays at being not only a grocer or a teacher, but also a windmill or a train" ("OM," p. 333; "UM," 2:1:210; trans. mod.). The physis thus engaged is not that of an immutable organic nature, but the historically formed, constantly changing nature of urban industrial capitalism, with its growing heap of ever-new commodities, gadgets, masks, and images.

Adorno prolongs this negative connotation of mimesis as an unreflected mimicry of/onto reified and alienated conditions, a compulsion to self-reification and self-alienation, in his analysis of mass culture; see espe- cially the sequel to the excursus on the culture industry in Dialectic of Enlightenment, "The Schema of Mass Culture," trans.

It is in "One-Way Street" that Benjamin begins to think more system- atically about the possibility of the mimetic in modernity, by juxtaposing various sites, forms, and models of mimetic innervation-writing, child- hood, dreaming, eros, politics. In most of these cases, the process of 64.

The em- phasis on the figural, rather than overt, quality of mimetic: correspondences relates to the mnemonic status of childhood experience, the element of distortion (Entstellung) that char- acterizes both memory traces and the forgotten/remembered moment of similitude, and it is no coincidence that Benjamin develops the notion of a "distorted similitude" in his essay on Proust, "The Image of Proust" (1929), Illuminations, p. 205; "Zum Bilde Prousts," Gesam- melte Schriften, 2:1:314; trans. mod.

The prototype of the former is the lover's gaze at the wrinkles in the beloved's face, an affectively charged perception or sensation that is anything but the critically distanced, test- ing look of the Brechtian observer: "If the theory is correct that sensory perception [Empfindung] does not reside in the head, that we perceive a window, a cloud, a tree not in our brains but rather in the place where we see them, then we are, in looking at our beloved, too, outside ourselves" ("OW," p. 449; "E," 4:1:92; trans. mod.; emphasis mine).68 I'd like to think that Benjamin recognized something of this affectively charged, excentric perception at work as well in the dispersed subjectivity of the cinema ex- perience. The prototypical figures of the incorporative dynamic, on the other hand, are the child, the cannibal, the screen actor, the clown: "Suspension of inner impulses and the bodily center. New unity of dress, tattoo, and body.... Logical choice of deep expressivity: the man sitting on a chair will remain seated even after the chair has been removed."69 In this image of extreme concentration the apparatus becomes part of the body; that is, the performance enacts, in an expressive, imaginative form, a process more commonly-and destructively-imposed upon people in everyday life. Both aspects of mimetic innervation are personified in the figure of the "excentric" ("K," 7:1:377), a precursor to Chaplin who, by "chopping up human expressive movement [Ausdrucksbewegung] into a sequence of minute innervations," internalizes the law of the apparatus, whether con- veyor belt or filmic montage, thus giving the encounter with technology an expression in the "image world."70 One might say that Benjamin finds in Chaplin an allegory, one allegory, for the very concept of innervation in and through film. As mentioned above, the grounding of innervation in the mimetic faculty entails a link between innervation and written language. While in his speculations on the mimetic faculty Benjamin stresses the practice of reading (invoking graphology and physiognomy, as well as Hugo von Hofmannsthal's maxim "to read what was never written"), in "One-Way Street" he is rather concerned with the activity of writing ("OM," p. 336; 68.

In a number of variations on his own craft, Benjamin sketches the principles, conditions, and rituals of successful writerly in- nervation, including the correct use of writing tools (see, for instance, "Post No Bills: The Writer's Technique in Thirteen Theses" ["OW," pp. 458-59; "E," 4:1:106-7]). This is the other context, besides "Prayer Wheel," in which the term innervation appears verbatim, significantly in a reflection on the future-and to some extent already outdatedness-of the typewriter. The typewriter will alienate the hand of the man of letters from the fountain pen only when the precision of typographic forms will enter directly into the conception of his books. This will likely require new systems of more variable typefaces. They will replace the pliancy of the hand with the innervation of the commanding fingers. ["OW," p. 457; "E," 4:1:105; trans. mod.] What Benjamin would like, obviously, is a computer, and a word pro- cessing program that operates in the graphic mode. Better yet, he wants to be wired-provided the new systems of writing are precise, flexible, and variable enough to play a productively mimetic role in the concep- tion of his books. Only then will he give up the beloved fountain pen, with its more intimate, habitual relation to the writer's hand, a traditional mimetic bond that makes the old-fashioned writing tool superior to the typewriter in its present form. As new technologies of inscription emerge, there are indications that "the book in [its] traditional form is nearing its end" ("OW," p. 456; "E," 4:1:102). For Benjamin, the passing of the Gutenberg era is signalled by poetic texts like Mallarm6's Un Coup de des, which was "the first to incorpo- rate the graphic tensions of the advertisement" into the "script-image" (Schriftbild) of the printed page ("OW," p. 456; "E," 4:1:102; trans. mod.). The models of poetic experiment are the more profane formations of film and advertisement ("a blizzard of changing, colorful, conflicting letters") which have forced script from its refuge, the book, into the street and into the "dictatorial perpendicular," just as the card index has expanded it into three-dimensionality. Thus writing "advances ever more deeply into the graphic regions of its new eccentric figurativeness" or pictoriality (Bildlichkeit) ("OW," p. 456; "E," 4:1:104). And if poets are farsighted enough to collaborate in the development of this "picture-writing" (Bild- erschrift), which includes learning from statistical and technical diagrams, they will renew their cultural authority in and through the medium of an international "Wandelschrift." More than simply a "moving script," Wan- delschrift implies two senses in which writing has become at once more moving and more mobile: a new mutability and plasticity of script (Wandel in the sense of change), which heralds a resurgence of writing's imagis- tic, sensuous, mimetic qualities; and the connotation of the verb wandeln</page><page sequence="29">334 Miriam Bratu Hansen Benjamin and Cinema (to walk, amble, wander), which suggests writing's migration into three- dimensional, public space and which makes reading a more tactile, dis- tracted experience ("OW," p. 457; "E,' 4:1:104). The new graphicity that evolves with modern media and advertising not only hybridizes pictorial and scriptural qualities, but it also makes writing part of a new economy of things, a changed phenomenology of nearness and distance, a different kind of sensory, aesthetic experience.71 In "One-Way Street," Benjamin articulates this new relationship with things most strikingly in "This Space for Rent," a piece that anticipates key concerns of the artwork essay. The terms of opposition here are not art and technical reproducibility but criticism (Kritik) and advertisement (Reklame), which, in Benjamin's words, is today "the most real, mercantile gaze into the heart of things" ("OW,"' p. 476; "E," 4:1:132). While criticism used to be defined by a stable vantage point and "correct distancing" (just as art, as he says elsewhere, used to "begin two meters off the body"),72 advertising tears into the liberal space of contemplation and "all but hits us between the eyes with things," in the same way that "a car, growing to gigantic proportions, careens at us out of a film screen" ("OW," p. 476; "E,' 4:1:132).73 And as the cinema renders furniture and fapades sensa- tional by means of their insistent, jerky nearness, advertising "hurls things at us with the tempo of a good film" ("OW," p. 476; "E," 4:1:132). In other words, advertising, like film, is a thing that both depicts the new world of things and, in its tactile, visceral appeal, significantly redrama- tizes our relation to things.74 The emphasis on physicality, speed, and directness aligns Benjamin with the enthusiasm for Hollywood films and all things American that was pervasive among avant-garde artists and intellectuals of the period, whether French, German, Soviet, Chinese, or Japanese. What is less com- mon, however, certainly among German proponents of Americanism, in particular the technophile modernists of Neue Sachlichkeit, is the way Benjamin entwines this new relation to things with dimensions of affect 71. On the question of a particular modern(ist) sense of "things," I am much indebted to discussions with Bill Brown and to his work-in-progress, "The Meaning of Things: Liter- ary Objects in America"; see Bill Brown, "How to Do Things with Things (A Toy Story)," Critical Inquiry 24 (Summer 1998): 935-64, and "The Secret Life of Things (Virginia Woolf and the Matter of Modernism)" (forthcoming in Modernism/Modernity). 72. Benjamin, "Traumkitsch," 2:2:622. 73. The alignment of nearness with things (and, implicitly, of distance with the image, Bild) can be found at great length in Klages, Vom Kosmogonischen Eros, pp. 416-41, a text whose generally antimodernist, antitechnological pathos must have provided a contrasting foil for "One-Way Street." 74. Commenting on "This Space for Rent," Taussig emphasizes the two-layered char- acter of Benjamin's modernist mimetics, the interconnectedness of the copying functions of the technical media with their ability to effect psychosomatic contact, that is, a new, corpo- real form of understanding or embodied knowing; see Taussig, Mimesis and Alterity, pp. 24-31 and The Nervous System, p. 145.</page><page sequence="30">Critical Inquiry Winter 1999 335 and sentimentality, even kitsch.75 Here we encounter the quotation I used in connection with the Hong Kong films at the beginning of this essay: Thereby [with advertisement's foreshortening of space and time in relation to things] "matter-of-factness" [Sachlichkeit] is finally dis- missed, and in the face of the huge images spread across the walls of buildings, where toothpaste and cosmetics ["Chlorodont" und "Sleipnir"] lie handy for giants, sentimentality is restored to health and liberated American style, just as people whom nothing moves or touches any longer are taught to cry again in the cinema. ["OW," p. 476; "E," 4:1:132; trans. mod.]76 Skirting the critical cliche about moving the masses with cliches, Benja- min envisions a regeneration of affect by means of technically produced images, that is, the possibility of countering the alienation of the human sensorium with the same means and media that are part of the technolog- ical proliferation of shock-anaesthetics-aestheticization. The chance to engage the senses differently lies in the epochal reconfiguration of "body- and image-space," in the emergence of new modes of imaging that refract the given organization of space, its forms and proportions, and articulate a new relation with the material world. Benjamin observes a mode of reception, corresponding to this new image world, that combines sensational affect with reflexivity and, con- versely, reflexivity with sensory immediacy. For it is not the message of the advertisement that moves people, even if they are moved to buy. Ben- jamin never loses sight of the fact that it is money that "effects [this] close contact with things," that the means of innervation are subject to "the brutal heteronomies of economic chaos" (which should make us hesitate, pace Kittler and Bolz, to turn Benjamin into a McLuhanite avant la lettre) ("OW," p. 476, 456; "E," 4:1:132, 103; trans. mod.)." But his primary concern here seems to be neither message nor medium (nor the priority of the latter over the former). Rather, he is fascinated, at a more phenom- enological level, with the sensory-aesthetic effects of advertising, in par- ticular a new imagination of color that blurs the fixed lines of objects, spaces, and institutions: "What, in the end, makes advertisements so su- perior to criticism? Not what the moving red neon sign says-but the fiery pool reflecting it in the asphalt" ("OW," p. 456; "E," 4:1:132).78 75. See above, note 5. 76. "Wird die gesundete Sentimentalitit amerikanisch frei, wie Menschen, welche nichts mehr riihrt und anriihrt, im Kino wieder das Weinen lernen." 77. When Benjamin evokes the force of money in this context, the field of reference is more likely Simmel's The Philosophy of Money than Marx's Capital. 78. This "speculative image," to use Howard Caygill's term, resonates with Benjamin's early reflections on the philosophy of color, which Caygill (Walter Benjamin, p. 82, see also pp. 9-13, 82-88, 150-52) has shown to be central to his concept of experience; see Ben- jamin, "Der Regenbogen: Gesprich fiber die Phantasie" (1915), Gesammelte Schriften,</page><page sequence="31">336 Miriam Bratu Hansen Benjamin and Cinema Profane illumination, indeed: The trope of commercial lighting, lit- eralized and refigured in the manner of Kracauer's vignettes on the same theme, suggests an excess of sensation over the capitalist design, a mi- metic connection with the afterlife of things.79 At the same time, the red pool becomes a medium of reflection, albeit an ephemeral one, exempli- fying a type of reflexivity that inheres in the material.80 This reflexivity is anything but contemplative, assuming a safe distance between observer and object; on the contrary, it implies a momentary fusion of vision and object, related to the curious condition that Benjamin refers to in the 1929 surrealism essay as a "nearness that looks out of its own eyes" ("wo die Nahe sich selbst aus den Augen sieht") ("SLS," p. 192; "SLM,' 2:1:309; trans. mod.). If we agree that Benjamin sought the equivalents of auratic experience (in the sense of investing the other with the ability to return the gaze) through and in the rubble of modern history, we should also heed what he insisted upon concerning the psychopoetic experiments of the surrealists: that they were on the trail-track, trace, Spur-"less of the soul than of things.""' In other words, they (like Benjamin) were less interested in things as a means for experiencing "structures of frail inter- 7:1:19-26; "Aphorismen zum Thema [Phantasie und Farbe]" (1914-15), "Die Farbe vom Kinde aus betrachtet" (1914-15), and "Zu einer Arbeit Oiber die Sch6nheit farbiger Bilder in Kinderbtichern: Bei Gelegenheit des Lyser" (1918-21), Gesammelte Schriften, 6:109-12, 123-25, trans.

Specifically, the image of the "fiery pool" reflecting, and dissolving, the actual neon sign recalls qualities of "chro- matic phantasy" or imagination that Benjamin discerns in children, their fascination with rainbows, soap bubbles, and pictures produced by decals and magic lanterns-color's fluid- ity ("moistness"), its freedom from contours and substance (color in opposition to form), its intensive infinity of nuances, its availability for shifting patterns and transformations. These qualities may also have played a part in Benjamin's adult fascination with animated film, in particular the metamorphoses of objects and characters, the freewheeling interchange between the animate and inanimate world, in early Disney films; see "Erfahrung und Armut," 2:1:218-19. 79.

See Benjamin's fragment, "Die Reflexion in der Kunst und in der Farbe" (1914- 15), Gesammelte Schriften, 6:118, in which he claims that color has an inherent reflexivity: "Das Aussehen der Farben und ihr gesehen Werden ist gleich / Das heiBt: die Farben sehen sich" (The look of the colors is the equivalent of their being seen / This is to say: the colors see themselves). 81.

And this juncture should help us understand more systematically why Benjamin needed the cinema to think both of these concepts-and why the cinema, like other technical media but more so, was central to his effort to both articulate and mobi- lize the antinomies of modernity. The answer, tentatively, will turn on the double mediation involved in the cinematic process, that between the film and the depicted world and that between the projected film and the audi- ence, that is, distinct yet mutually interdependent mediations both at the level of film as a technology of inscription and at the level of cinema as the social, collective, public space/time of reception. When Benjamin first uses the term in his "Little History of Photogra- phy" (1931), optical unconscious refers primarily to the level of inscription, specifically the ability of the apparatus and particular photographic tech- niques to register aspects of material reality that are invisible to the un- armed human eye-the microtexture of plants, the way people walk. The mimetic, cognitive capacity of photographic inscription rests, almost par- adoxically, with the element of chance or contingency inherent in me- chanical vision, however constructed and manipulated; the camera's otherness, one might say its track with the look of the other, translates into an affinity with the unseen, the overly familiar, the repressed-with anything that eludes conscious, intentional perception: "It is, after all, a different nature [eine andere Natur, an-other nature] that speaks to the camera than to the human eye; different in particular in the sense that an unconsciously permeated space takes the place of the space that man has interwoven with consciousness."84 Since the element of contingency pertains to the indexical dimension of photographic representation, that is, the material bond with the world depicted (the camera having been there at a particular point in time, light rays having linked the object with the photochemical emulsion for 82.

Looking at the wedding picture of the photographer Dauthendey and his wife who was to commit suicide after the birth of their sixth child, Benjamin observes: No matter how artful the photographer, no matter how carefully posed his subject, the beholder feels an irresistible urge to search such a picture for the tiny spark of contingency [Zufall], of the Here and Now, with which reality has so to speak seared the character of the image, to find the inconspicuous spot where in the thusness [So- sein] of that minute long past the future subsists so eloquently that we, looking back, may rediscover it.85 The eruption of the uncanny into representational space/time is experi- enced-and provoked-by the beholder, but the forgotten future that answers to the searching gaze is assumed to be deposited, seared, en- crypted in the photographic image. This unconscious archive makes pho- tography, early photography at least, a mnemotechnical device capable of compensating for the historical loss of "all natural, physiological aids of memory," which Benjamin saw as the precondition of the "Copernican turn" in both remembrance and historiography (PW, 5:1:490 [Konvolut K 1, 1]). This is to say that, pace Proust and contrary to Benjamin's own pessimistic analysis (in the Baudelaire essay) of photography's erosion of the mimoire involontaire, the optical unconscious marks a spot that re- admits dimensions of temporality and memory via, and into, the very technologies capable of eliminating them. Like the images of involuntary memory ("developed in the darkroom of the lived moment"), the optical unconscious does not just reactualize a lost prior vision: rather, it makes us see "images that we have never seen before we remember them.""86 Unlike Proust's elegiac, personal quest, however, photography's mobiliza- tion of an unconscious past points toward a form of memory that is trans- individual and potentially collective-both in spite and because of its technically mediated character. "The possibility of creating an openness to the future," which How- ard Caygill locates as the gist of the optical unconscious, assumes a more overt political significance in relation to film.87 It is no coincidence that Benjamin begins to develop the notion of an optical unconscious (without naming it) in his defense of Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, around the time he was completing "One-Way Street." In a polemical exchange over "collectivist art," he speaks of the "conspiratorial relationship between 85. Ibid.; trans. mod. 86.

The mimetic capacity for capturing traces of social experience in the ostensibly dead world of things draws on both the representational qualities of photography (in- cluding indexically grounded contingency) and procedures specific to film (such as slow motion, variable framing, and editing). Thanks to these fracturing, alienating techniques film does not merely depict a given world, but makes that world visible for the first time, produces it for the sensoria of a spectating collective. Hence Benjamin underscores that film in fact opens up "a new region of consciousness"; it provides a "prism" that transforms the past forgotten in the hopeless present into the possibility of a future: [Film] is, succinctly put, the only prism in which the immediate envi- ronment-the spaces in which he lives, goes about his business, and takes his pleasures-reveals itself intelligibly, sensibly, and passion- ately to the contemporary observer. In themselves these offices, fur- nished rooms, bars, city streets, train stations, and factories are ugly, unintelligible, and hopelessly sad. Rather, they were and they appeared to be that way until the advent of film. Having discovered the dynamite of tenths of a second, film exploded this old world of incarcera- tion, leading us into wide-ranging, adventurous journeys among the scattered ruins. ["DR," p. 626; "EO," 2:2:752; trans. mod.; emphasis mine] The dynamic temporality suggested in this passage is one of historical transition and social transformation. For the adventurous spaces Benja- min explores in his defense of Potemkin are spaces of the collective, and they apprise the bourgeois intellectual of the passing of his own class: "The proletariat is the hero of those spaces to whose adventures, heart pounding, the bourgeois gives himself over in the cinema, because he must enjoy the 'beautiful' precisely where it speaks to him of the destruc- tion of his class" ("DR," p. 627; "EO," 2:2:753; trans. mod.). But the cinema's most important collective space is, or at least used to be, the cinema itself-the movie theater as a public space of exhibition and reception, moviegoing as a specifically modern, technically mediated 88.

The moviegoing experience would therefore seem to be the logical site for thinking through the possibility of a bodily collective innervation, as the condition of an alternative interaction with technology and the commodity world. For the optical unconscious, as the medium of a trans- formed mimetic capacity, to become effective as/in collective innervation, the level of inscription would have to be hinged into that of reception, that is, the psychoanalytically inflected temporality of the former would have to mesh with the collective subjectivity of the latter. Only then would the technically enabled extension and decentering of the sensorium (at the level of the filmic text) translate into an imaginative, empowering incorporation of the apparatus on the part of the audience. Benjamin seems to suggest as much when he asserts that it is only with the "human collective that film can complete the prismatic work that it began with milieu," though he subsequently limits his discussion to the moving masses depicted in Eisenstein's film, the collectivity on, rather than in front of, the screen ("DR," p. 627; "EO0" 2:2:753). It is this step, the extension of the optical unconscious to the spectat- ing collective, which Benjamin attempted in the early versions of the art- work essay, specifically in his remarks on the "globe-orbiting" Mickey Mouse (whose name headed the entire section on the optical unconscious in the first, handwritten version). As I have elaborated elsewhere, Benja- min's reading of Mickey Mouse as a "figure of the collective dream" main- tains a sense of disjunctive temporality, the mnemonic/psychoanalytic slant that marks the optical unconscious at the level of filmic inscription (leaving aside for the moment that Benjamin makes his case with an ani- mated creature rather than a figure from photographic live-action film; he could have chosen Chaplin). The dream memory that Mickey inner- vates, however, is inseparable from that of nightmares, in particular mod- ern nightmares induced by industrial and military technology. The early Disney films function as a form of "psychic inoculation," Benjamin ar- gues, because they effect a "premature and therapeutic detonation" of mass psychoses, of sadistic fantasies and masochistic delusions in the au- dience, by allowing them to erupt in the collective laughter. And the films provoke this laughter not only with their "grotesque" actions, their meta- morphic games with animate and inanimate, human and mechanical traits, but also with their precise rhythmic matching of acoustic and visual movement-through a series of staged shocks or, rather, countershocks that effect a transfer between film and audience and, one hopes, a recon- version of neurotic energy into sensory affect ("K," 7:1:377).89 The politics of innervation I have tried to delineate in Benjamin in- volves an understanding of the cinema as a form of sensory, psycho- 89. See Hansen, "Of Mice and Ducks," pp. 41-44.</page><page sequence="36">Critical Inquiry Winter 1999 341 somatic, aesthetic experience that includes but does not reduce to poststructuralist notions of writing and reading, however psychoanalyti- cally inflected. For the promise the cinema held out was that it might give the technologically altered sensorium access to a contemporary, materi- ally based, and collective form of reflexivity that would not have to surrender the mimetic and temporal dimensions of (historically individu- alized) experience. At this juncture, the cinema appeared as the only in- stitution capable of linking the antinomic trajectories of modernity and thus wresting them from their catastrophic course. Which is to say that the cinema, rather than thriving on and exacerbating the spiral of shock, anaesthetics, and aestheticization, could work to diffuse the deadly vio- lence unleashed by capitalist technology, could yet be revolutionary in the sense of "a purely preventive measure intended to avert the worst."90 If the Medusan gaze of the camera is affiliated with the backward-flying angel of history, then Mickey Mouse embodies the possibility of meeting that gaze and countering it-with apotropaic games of innervation. But Mickey disappeared from the final version of the artwork essay, and with him the term innervation. In that version, the section on the optical unconscious opens with a reference to Freud's Psychopathology of Everyday Life, which Benjamin invokes to illustrate the enrichment of our perceptual world with the advent of film. Just as this book has "isolated and made analyzable things which had heretofore floated along unno- ticed in the broad stream of perception," "film has brought about a simi- lar deepening of apperception" "for the entire spectrum of optical, and now also acoustical," phenomena.91 Benjamin introduces the comparison with an example from the sphere of language, "a slip of the tongue," but then retreats, on the side of film, to the discourse of surgery (introduced in a previous section), as he extols the filmic representation of a scene or situation for its ability to "isolate" a performance or behavior "like a mus- cle of a body," which illustrates the importance of film's "tendency to pro- mote the mutual penetration of art and science."92 In either case, the optical unconscious is lodged at the level of inscription; its actualization remains a matter of individual analysis, whether conceived as reading, deciphering, or dissecting. What drops out of the concept is the specific- ity of the cinema experience, in particular its sensory-somatic immediacy, anonymous collectivity, and unpredictability. Accordingly, collective re- ception is segregated into the following section, subsumed under the no- tion of distraction, which in turn is reduced to a Brechtian attitude of critical testing and thus robbed of its mimetic, "excentric," as well as mne- motechnical dimensions. 90.

It is easy to blame Adorno for the mutilation of the artwork essay, but we should not over- look Benjamin's own ambivalence, not least regarding the figure of Mickey. In a note accompanying the early drafts of the essay he remarks on the "usability of the Disney method for fascism,"93 and in a footnote to the second version he expands this remark to suggest that the most recent Disney films manifest a tendency already implicit in the earlier ones: "to put up comfortably with bestiality and brutality as corollaries of existence" ("K," 7:1:377 n. 14). Nor can we ignore the problems that Benjamin might have had with the actual collective assembled in urban movie theaters, a collective whose demographic profile was not predomi- nantly and simply working class, let alone consciously proletarian. The heterogeneous mass public that congregated in, and was catalyzed by, the cinema of the Weimar period consisted largely of people who bore the brunt of modernization-women, white collar workers of both sexes; its demographically most salient feature was gender rather than class.94 And as a new social formation this mass public was just as unpredictable and politically volatile as German society at large. It would have been conceiv- able to think of the moviegoing collective as being made up of individual viewers, with the kinds of mimetic engagement Benjamin found in the surrealists, the child, the beholder of old photographs, or, for that matter, Proust. But it is also historically understandable why Benjamin, unlike Kracauer, did not make that leap of faith-why he submerged the imagi- native, mnemotechnical possibilities of the medium into a presentist poli- tics of distraction, renouncing the cinematic play with otherness in view of the increasingly threatening otherness of actual mass publics. Collective innervation as an alternative to anaesthetics, the apotro- paic game with technology, seems to have failed, at least in Benjamin's lifetime; the cosmic mating fantasy in the spirit of technology that he pictured the First World War as at the end of "One-Way Street" returned in the Second World War as a bloodbath of exponentially vaster scope and efficiency. But we have to admire Benjamin for having taken on the gamble, the "vabanque game" with technology. For if anything was not an antinomy for Benjamin, nor even cause for ambivalence, it was the con- nection between aesthetics and politics: the insight that the fate of the "beautiful" was inseparable from the transformation of the human senso- 93.

See, among others, Patrice Petro, Joyless Streets: Women and Melodramatic Representa- tion in Weimar Germany (Princeton, N.J., 1989). Kracauer was among the first to recognize and analyze the formation of this new mass public, particularly in and through the cinema and other institutions of leisure culture; see his pathbreaking study, Die Angestellten: Aus dem neuesten Deutschland (1929), ed. Karsten Witte, vol. 1 of Schriften (Frankfurt am Main, 1978), pp. 205-304, as well as his important, if notorious, series, "The Little Shopgirls Go to the Movies" (1927), The Mass Ornament, pp. 291-304.</page><page sequence="38">Critical Inquiry Winter 1999 343 rium; and that the fate of the human senses, pertaining to the very con- ditions of social experience, the ecology of public life, was a political question of utmost urgency. This is why his turn to a profane, materialist understanding of "actuality" involved recognizing the centrality of the question of technology, as the medium in which the decisive confronta- tions over humanity's future were taking place. And this is why taking Benjamin's imperative to "actuality" seriously today means recognizing that the cinema, once celebrated for articulating the secret affinities among things in an age of accelerated obsolescence, may itself have become a thing of the past. As video and digital technolo- gies are replacing the medium of photographic film (with its indexical dimensions of temporality and contingency) and as the cinema, as an in- stitution of public, collective reception, has ceased to be the primary venue in which films are consumed, Benjamin's reflections on film and media culture may likewise have lost their actuality and may stand, as Bolz has recently proclaimed, as nothing more than "beautiful ruins in the philosophical landscape."95 But reconstructing these reflections in their complexity and extremity is not just a philological endeavor, nor a matter of getting Benjamin "right" versus oversimplifying readings and appropriations. Rather, understanding the issues he struggled with as genuine antinomies, and the limitations of his argument as limits posed by historical and political realities, should help us not only to guard against idealizations of either individualized or collective subjectivities and identities but also to discern similar antinomies in today's media cul- ture-that culture which, whether we like it or not, is the framing condi- tion of any cultural practice today. Whether the cinema, having lost its economic, social, and epistemic centrality, will remain open to the future depends in part on whether the electronic and digital media that have displaced and transformed it will allow for new forms of innervation, dif- ferent possibilities of mimetic experience, temporal disjunction, and re- flexivity; it also depends on whether the cinema can remain open to its own forgotten futures in other than merely nostalgic ways. If Mickey Mouse confronted Benjamin from the elsewhere of America and in the mode of cel animation, we confront Mickey Mouse today from the else- where of Hong Kong, as part of a film practice that engages with techno- logies of incorporation and embodiment that indeed make the cinema a memory, in more than one sense. 95.
