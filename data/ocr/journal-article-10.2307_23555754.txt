Segal* School of Divinity, History and Philosophy, University of Aberdeen, King's Quadrangle, Aberdeen AB24 3UB, Scotland, UK r.segal@abdn.ac.uk Abstract It is usually assumed that, as an approach to religion, or to culture in general, functionalism is passé. Functionalism has been superseded by structuralism, poststructuralism, and postmodern ism. Yet the appeal of functionalism as an explanation of the existence or persistence of religion has meant the continuing appearance of functionalist works on religion, which hail mainly from the social sciences. This article focuses on the philosophical problems posed by functionalism. Some of those problems are hoary. Others, while already recognized, were presented in their classic form in 1959 by Carl Hempel. Only those social scientists with philosophical proclivities were ever affected by Hempels challenge. Their unanimous response has been to try to meet the challenge, and the fate of functionalism has been assumed to rest with the response to Hempel. This article presents responses by philosophers themselves to Hempel. It concentrates on the response by Robert Cummins, who defends functionalism in biology and, by implication, social science by recharacterizing it—and in turn making Hempel's challenge irrelevant. What a func tionalist approach to religion guided by Cummins' depiction of functionalism would look like is offered. Keywords Cummins, functionalism, Hempel, Radcliffe-Brown, Rappaport, Weber What is the status today of functionalism in the study of religion? The heyday of functionalism was, roughly, the first half of the twentieth century. Certainly functionalist accounts of religion still exist, and prominent social scientists conventionally labelled functionalists include J. Milton Yinger, Bryan Wilson, Hans Mol, Niklas Luhmann, I. M. Lewis, Marvin Harris, and Roy Rappa port. But functionalism as a "cutting-edge" approach to religion, or to culture as a whole, has long been succeeded—in the Sixties and Seventies by struc turalism and in the Eighties and thereafter by poststructuralism and post modernism. One measure of the seeming outdatedness of functionalism is * For exceedingly helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper, I thank Dr. Gerry Hough, philosopher at the University of Aberdeen, and the anonymous referee. ) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010 DOl: 10.1163/157006810X531120</page><page sequence="2">R. A.

Functionalism has thrived in at least three domains: philosophy, biology, and social science. In philosophy, functionalism is to be found in meta-ethics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of mind. In the philosophy of mind functionalism was pioneered in the Sixties by Hilary Putnam (1967) and is associated with such figures as Jerry Fodor and Ned Block.1 Functionalism here is an alternative to behaviorism. It assumes that mental states exist but that they are "supervenient" on physical ones: there are no mental states with out physical ones. The term "functional" means functionally equivalent: like different kinds of computers, different kinds of brains—those of humans, ani mals, and Martians—can still produce, or "realize," the same mental states—for example, pain. Unlike the identity theory of mind, a mental state need not correspond to just one physical state. Functionalism has succeeded both behaviourism and identity theory as the leading present-day position in the philosophy of mind. Like functionalism in other fields, functionalism in phi losophy seeks to bring the discipline in line with up-to-date science. In biology, functionalism as an explanation of living entities generally is as popular today as it ever was. It is usually tied to evolution, with survival as the ultimate function served. Functionalism as an idea, even if not so named, thus goes back to Darwin. I. A Brief History of Functionalism In psychology, functionalism, and of a kind akin to that in philosophy of mind, is associated with the American psychologist James Angelí. In sociology and social anthropology, which are the mainstays of the approach in the social sciences, functionalism is conventionally traced back to Emile Durkheim and above all to his account of religion in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915). Whether or not Durkheim really qualifies as a functionalist, he was taken as a functionalist par excellence by one of the two key figures who for mally introduced functionalism to the study of religion: the English social anthropologist A. R. Radcliffe-Brown.2 In his belatedly published The Anda man Islanders (1922), which was based on his notes from his fieldwork in ' Putnam himself subsequently repudiated functionalism, and philosophical functionalists attack one another. 2 On RadclifFe-Brown's indebtedness to Durkheim, see Segal 1999. On Radcliffe-Brown's truncating of Durkheim, who is in fact more than a functionalist, see Segal 1999: 154-7.</page><page sequence="3">342 R. A. Segal / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 1906-08 but which was subsequently written up under the spell of Durkheim, he rejected the historical approach then dominant in at least British anthro pology. He sought to make social anthropology scientific.3 He rejected as merely conjectural and therefore for him unscientific the question of historical origin, which he always equated with the question of origin per se.4 Like his fellow pioneering functionalist in anthropology, Bronislaw Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown was reluctant to venture beyond observation even once he had arrived on the veranda. Oblivious to the unabashed effort at reconstruct ing the history, for example, of the earth in so tough-minded a science as geol ogy, he insisted that only the present, not the past, can be studied scientifically. His credo: forgo speculating about the origin of religion, and figure out what religion is doing now. Whether the function of religion or of anything else is actually observable is a separate issue. Surely function, like cause, is inferred rather than seen. Certainly the function cannot be garnered from informants since for Radc liffe-Brown, following Durkheim, the function is latent rather than mani fest—to use the terms appropriated (from Freud) by the functionalist sociologist Robert Merton (1949). The biggest difference between Radcliffe-Brown and Malinowski, whose functionalism does not derive from Durkheim, is that the function for Radc liffe-Brown is exclusively social, whereas for Malinowski it is at least as much individual as social. Functionalists, though not just functionalists, often refer to "needs", which religion or anything else serves to fulfill. For Radcliffe Brown, the needs are on the part of society. For Malinowski, they are on the part of the individual and are largely biological.5 Seemingly, functionalism is mere common sense. Of course, religion serves a function. What doesn't? Common sense even dictates that religion would die out if it ceased earning its bread. But functionalism is not the same as func tion. Functionalism means not just attention but exclusive attention to func tion. Functionalism means the claim that religion is not just helpful but outright indispensable to whatever it effects. Above all, functionalism means the claim that religion is not just necessary but also sufficient for, say, stability. Without religion, no stability; with religion, stability. Because functionalists 3 The title of a posthumously published book by Radcliffe-Brown says it all: A Natural Science of Society (1957). 4 By contrast to Radcliffe-Brown, Durkheim distinguished the questions and sought the recurrent origin of religion while rejecting the historical question as unanswerable. 5 To distinguish his brand of functionalism from Malinowksi's, Radcliffe-Brown calls his brand "structural-functionalism." Structure means social structure and not, as in structuralism, the structure of the mind.</page><page sequence="4">R. A. Segal /Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 343 work back from stability to religion as the cause, religion must be a sufficient as well as a necessary cause. By no means do all who attend to the function of religion or even get labelled functionalists go this far and so qualify as func tionalists. Perhaps not even the functionalism of all of the figures I named as prominent functionalists meets these criteria. II. Hempel's Attack on Functionalism Functionalism carried on buoyantly until 1959, when the philosopher of sci ence Carl Hempel wrote "The Logic of Functional Analysis" (reprinted, slightly revised, in Hempel 1965). Hempel discusses functionalism in biology and social science but, writing prior to Putnam, not in philosophy. His criti cisms of biology and social science are the same. First, both fields are wrong to insist on a different kind of explanation from that in physical science. Func tional explanation, which seeks the purpose, or telos, of religion or anything else, is in fact just another case of causal explanation, which seeks the origin— the recurrent origin—of religion or anything else. Second, even when functionalism acknowledges that it is offering a causal explanation, the cause is nonempirical and therefore unprovable. Hempel is not objecting to teleological, or "goal-directed", explanations per se. He allows for "reason-explanations" of human behavior. He is also prepared to credit the heart with circulating the blood and thereby keeping a vertebrate alive, just not with any intent on the part of either the vertebrate or the heart. Third and most important, the explanation that functionalism gives is fal lacious. It commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. For Hempel, a valid deductive argument (by modus ponens) might take the following form: PREMISE: If religion, then stability. PREMISE: Religion. CONCLUSION: Therefore stability. Hempel would consider this argument a valid proof of the effect, or function, of religion. Of course, the premises must be true for the conclusion to be not merely valid but also true. The explanation to which Hempel objects works in reverse: PREMISE: If religion, then stability. PREMISE: Stability. CONCLUSION: Therefore religion.</page><page sequence="5">344 R. A. Segal /Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 This claim is invalid because the cause is deduced from the effect and not vice versa. Because the argument is deductive, the conclusion is supposed to follow necessarily from the premises. What is thus claimed is not that stability may be caused by religion but that it must be caused by religion. Yet how can other causes be ruled out? To cite two quotations from The Andaman Islanders: "A society depends for its existence on the presence in the minds of its mem bers of a certain system of sentiments by which the conduct of the individual is regulated in conformity with the needs of the society" (Radcliffe-Brown 1922: 233-4). "The ceremonial (i.e., collective) expression of any sentiment serves both to maintain it at the requisite level of intensity in the mind of the individual and to transmit it from one generation to another. Without such expression the sentiments involved could not exist" (Radcliffe-Brown 1922: 234). Without ceremonial, or religious ritual, no sentiments; without senti ments, no obedience to society; without obedience to society, no stability. The irony in functionalism is that it purports to avoid the issue of origin by limiting itself to function, but the appeal to the function of religion to explain stability is really offered as the origin of religion. Why is there stability? Because of religion. The origin may be recurrent rather than historical, but origin it still is. The fallacy lies not in making stability the necessary effect of religion but in making religion the necessary cause of stability. More precisely, the fallacy lies not even in making religion the necessary cause of stability but in basing the explanation on the sheer coexistence of religion and stability. Religion may actually be the necessary cause of stability, but proving it so requires ruling out other possible causes. Few functionalists even try to rule out alternatives. Yet Hempel's objection to functionalism is to more than causality. The fal lacy of affirming the consequent holds even for correlation and not only for causality. My shorthand phrase "If religion, then stability" must be spelled out. The claim can be simply that wherever there is religion, there is stability. And the conclusion—still fallacious—can be that wherever there is stability, there is religion. A causal argument would be claiming that religion produces stability. The establishment of this premise would require evidence not merely that stability is always present when religion is present but also that all other possible (suf ficient) causes of stability can be ruled out. Even if all other possible causes of stability can be ruled out, the argument is still fallacious. For the argument is supposed to make religion necessary for the existence of stability, so that sta bility requires religion. But other possible causes cannot be ruled out as more than unlikely. Religion would thereby be merely the likeliest cause of stability. "The functionalist argument, however, rules in religion by necessity.</page><page sequence="6">R A. Segal / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 345 Hempel treats functionalism as a form of causal explanation. He assumes that, for example, neovitalism in biology "is meant to provide an explanation for various characteristically biological phenomena, such as regeneration and regulation, which according to neovitalism cannot be explained by physical and chemical laws alone" (Hempel 1965: 304). Likewise he assumes—cor rectly—that social scientific functionalists are attributing stability to religion. But Hempel's overall philosophical concern is with the logic of explanation, be the explanation causal or not. He sees explanation as argument—a view since challenged by, among many others, Wesley Salmon. Because explanation for Hempel is an argument, the conclusion must follow from the premises. The conclusion does not have to follow with necessity. Hempel works out probabilistic, or "inductive-statistical" (I-S), explanations, in which the con clusion follows with merely high likelihood. Most causal explanations in the social sciences, as well as some in the natural sciences, are probabilistic. But functionalist explanations, as reconstructed by Hempel, are deductive, or "deductive-nomological" (D-N), so that the conclusion must follow necessar ily. Hempel objects to functionalism not because it argues deductively but because it argues fallaciously. III. The Response to Hempel by Nonphilosophers What has happened to functionalism in social science since Hempel's attack? In my chapter in Contemporary Theories of Religion (see Segal 2009), I discuss the lifelong attempt of celebrated anthropologist Roy Rappaport (1968,1984, 1999) to meet Hempel's challenge. Rappaport, a self-proclaimed functional ist, assumes that functionalism in social science has been killed off by Hempel and can be resurrected only if Hempel's criticisms are answerable. Hempel is almost the sole critic Rappaport cites, and Hempel's version of functionalism is the sole one he considers. Oddly, Rappaport ignores till later the charge of affirming the consequent.6 Nevertheless, for him the fate of functionalism rests on responding to Hempel. 6 In my chapter in Contemporary Theories of Religion I argue that, despite his preoccupation with Hempel, Rappaport fails to meet or even to recognize the challenge. In his first book, Pigs for the Ancestors (1968), Rappaport actually misses Hempel's central criticism: that functionalism is fallacious. In the second edition (1984) Rappaport at last considers the challenge but hardly meets it. In his last book, the posthumously published Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (1999), Rappaport now asserts that his functionalism had been meant to offer only a formal and not a causal explanation of the relationship between one variable and another, such as between religious ritual and stability. Could ve fooled me!</page><page sequence="7">346 R. A. Segal/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 By contrast to Rappaport, the scholar of religious studies Hans Penner (1971, 1989) assumes that most explanations of religion are still functional ist.7 He asserts that "functional explanations of religions have maintained a powerful hold on most of the social sciences" (Penner 1989: 104) and that "functionalism can be viewed as the theory for explaining things in the social sciences" (Penner 1989:106).8 According to Penner, Hempel's attack, far from acknowledged, goes unknown in social science, not to mention religious studies.9 Penner thus assumes of Hempel's challenge the opposite of what Rappaport assumes. But just like Rappaport, Penner equates functionalism with Hempel's characterization of it, takes Hempel as the main critic of func tionalism, and tries to meet Hempel's criticisms. Antithetically to Rappaport, he concentrates almost exclusively on the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Penner ventures beyond Rappaport to consider ways of refining functional ism to fend off Hempel's attack. But he deems all proposed ways to be failures. He quotes a social scientist, one of the apparent few even aware of Hempel, who concludes that "functionalist notions should be excluded altogether from the social sciences." Adds Penner: "I think this is good advice" (Penner 1989: 123). Unaware of explicit social scientific alternatives to functionalism such as rational choice theory, which concentrates on manifest functions,10 he turns to structuralism, which has nothing to do with function. 7 Penner's first essay, "The Poverty of Functionalism" (1971), gets extended and updated in his second, which now has the title "Functional Explanations of Religion" (1989). 8 Penner can make his hyped claims about the continued pervasiveness of functional ism in all of social "scientificdom" only by equating functionalism with function! It is not even true that all social scientists tend to the function of religion. For example, interpretivist social scientists are primarily concerned with what religion expresses rather than with what it effects. They skin the issues of both function and recurrent origin. But among those social scientists who do tend to the function—the majority of social scientists by far—by no means do all of them ignore recur rent origin, which is to say merely subsume it under function. 9 Some examples do bear out Penner's claim. For example, the Guide to the Study of Religion (2000), while bereft of an entry on function or functionalism, does have an entry on "defini tion", which mindlessly praises a functionalist approach to religion and is oblivious to any prob lems in the approach: see Arnal 2000: 24-5. The entry on functionalism in the second edition of the magisterial Encyclopedia of Religion (2005), which reprints the entry from the first edition (1987), defends functionalism, not against any conceptual criticism but against the charge, for example, that functionalism sees religion as serving a one-sidedly conservative function: see Rob ertson (2005): 3232-3. The short entry on functionalism in the fourth edition of the equally magisterial Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart( 1998-2005) repeats this criticism but does cite a conceptual problem, classically stated by sociologist Kingsley Davis, that amounts to Hempel's first criticism: see Jôdicke (2005): 279. 10 For a defense of functionalism in religion against the dismissal of it by rational choice theorists like Rodney Stark and William Bainbridge, see David Sloan Wilson, Darwin's Cathedral (2002). Wilson defends the functionalism of Durkheim himself. Wilson does mention Hempel, but to contest only Hempel's criticism that functionalist explanations are untestable: see Wilson 2002,70-1.</page><page sequence="8">R. A. Segal / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 347 IV. Hie Response to Hempel by Philosophers Neither Rappaport, writing as late as 1999, nor Penner, writing as late as 1989, is aware of responses to Hempel by philosophers, not just social scien tists." Philosophers have bypassed Hempel's challenge by recharacterizing functionalism in biology if not yet in social science, let alone religious studies. To begin with, there are problems besetting functionalism that antedate the ones noted by Hempel. Some of these problems presuppose what later gets questioned: that a functionalist explanation is a causal explanation. First is the problem of backward causation: present behavior is explained by future goals, so that the effect precedes the cause. A person prays to God in order to get well. The goal, which should come at the end of the behavior, comes before the behavior. A heart beats to fulfill the goal of circulating the blood. The functionalist reply: in human behavior the goal is an intention, which does precede the action. To act is to act on the intention. But for that reply to hold for plants and animals, intentions, which is to say mental states, must be ascribed to them. Second, then, is the problem of anthropomorphism. Any reply requires the attribution to plants and animals of goals yet not intentions. Third is the problem that function means more than effect. If on the one hand functionalism is thereby spared having to find a function for every effect, such as the beating of the heart, on the other hand functionalism is obliged to explain those effects that do serve functions. Writing in 1975, philosopher Robert Cummins seeks to recharacterize functionalism in a diffèrent way from Hempel.12 He begins by presenting the two assumptions made by all existing philosophical critics of functionalism, not just by Hempel: (A) The point of functional characterization in science is to explain the presence of the item (organ, mechanism, process or whatever) that is functionally characterized. (B) For something to perform its function is for it to have certain effects on a containing system, which effects contribute to the performance of some " Even Robert McCauley and Thomas Lawson, in "Functionalism Reconsidered" (1984), work within Hempel. In "Functionalism and the Explanation of Religion" (1980) Herbert Burhenn uses Rappaport s Pigs in defense of functionalism against Hempel, who for Burhenn demands too much of functionalism. James Spickard's "A Revised Functionalism in the Sociol ogy of Religion" (1991) offers not a new characterization of functionalism but simply a refined description of Mary Douglas' old-style functionalism. 12 For whatever I know of functionalism since Hempel, 1 am indebted to Dr. Ulrich Steg mann, whose lectures on the philosophy of biology at the University of Aberdeen I attended in spring 2010.</page><page sequence="9">348 R. A. Segal/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 activity of, or the maintenance of some condition in, that containing system. (Cummins 1975: 741) According to Cummins, the uncritical "adherence" to these assumptions "has crippled the most serious attempts to analyze functional statements" (Cum mins 1975: 742). Even though, again, Hempel himself is concerned with the logic of explana tion, whether or not the explanation is causal, he assumes (A) that a functional analysis, despite the association of functionalism with function rather than with cause, claims to be explaining why religion or the heart exists or persists. He also assumes (B) that a functional analysis claims that religion or the heart serves a function and not merely has an effect when it contributes to the maintenance of society or the organism. Hempel's indictment of functional ism for affirming the consequent requires both assumptions. If (A) functional ism does not claim to be explaining religion or the heart, then the stability of society or the health of the organism is not being invoked to explain reli gion or the heart. If (B) functionalism does not claim to be explaining stability or health, then religion or the heart is not being invoked to explain stability or health. Hempel argues that functionalism, taken as explaining religion or the heart, faces a Hobsons choice: the functionalist argument is either invalid or likely false. The argument is invalid if it concludes from the existence or persistence of stability or health that religion or the heart is the cause. Something else might be the cause. It is not fallacious to attribute stability or health to religion or the heart. It is fallacious to deduce religion or the heart as the cause from stability or health itself. At the same time it is surely false to maintain that religion or the heart is the only possible cause. To quote Cummins: "It is false, for example, [to claim] that the heart is a necessary condition for circulation in vertebrates, since artificial pumps can be, and are, used to maintain the flow of blood" (Cummins 1975: 743). What to do? Cummins proposes rejecting assumptions A and B alike. What he proposes: rather than making functionalism the explanation of the heart, make functionalism the explanation of circulation. Start with the heart as already present rather than seek to account for it. Appeal to the heart to explain circulation and in turn health rather than appeal to circulation and in turn health to explain the heart. Cummins rejects assumption A: that functional ism seeks to explain the heart by invoking the effect of the heart. Instead, he argues that, however the heart arose or continues to arise, organisms with hearts—hearts that circulate the blood—have a higher chance of survival than organisms without hearts or at least without "functioning" hearts. Cummins takes the case of protozoans, all of which have "contractile vacu oles" for removing excess water. The contractile vacuole</page><page sequence="10">R A. Segal I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 349 occurs in marine protozoans that have no excess-water problem but [indeed] the reverse problem. Thus the function and effect on survival of this structure [i.e., vacuole] is not the same in all protozoans. Yet the explanation of its presence is almost certainly the same. This fact reminds us that the processes actually respon sible for the occurrence of contractile vacuoles in protozoans are totally insensitive to what that structure does. (Cummins 1975: 750) The presence of the contractile vacuole in all protozoans is not being explained. What is being explained is why, with the vacuole, certain protozoans "are able to keep from exploding in fresh water" (Cummins 1975: 751). Cummins thus distinguishes the role that an entity plays from the creation of it. He thereby disentangles function from cause—the link that Hempel assumes. Functionalism for Cummins is still an explanation, but now of the role that, to revert to the prior example, the circulation of blood by the heart plays in the health of the organism. The heart is taken as a subsystem within the organism as a whole. There are other subsystems, and each one contributes to the health and, in Darwinian fashion, survival of the organism. But each contributes as a mere part. The functional question is not why a single part like the heart is present but what role what the heart does—circulating blood— plays in the maintenance of the organism. The heart has no function of its own. To say that it has merely a contributing function would be to miss the point. Cummins thus rejects assumption B. Cummins gives the "transparent example" of assembly-line production: Production is broken down into a number of distinct tasks. Each point on the line is responsible for a certain task, and it is the function of the workers/machines at that point to complete that task. If the line has the capacity to produce the prod uct, it has it in virtue of the fact that the workers/machines have the capacities to perform their designated tasks, and in virtue of the fact that when these tasks are performed in a certain organized way—according to a certain program—the fin ished product results. (Cummins 1975: 760) Cummins' version of functionalism starts with the equivalent of society or the organism as a whole and breaks down its operation into its components. The explanation is not why there are workers of type X or machines of type Y— questions that functionalism conventionally characterized tries to answer— but what specific tasks each does that, together with the tasks performed by all other workers and machines, function to produce the product. Cummins' brand of functionalism has been faulted on many grounds. For example, almost anything can be fitted into a system and thereby be part of something that serves a function. The power of functionalism, which rests on the distinction between those things that have functions and those that have mere effects, is thereby dissipated. Conversely, by denying parts of a sys tem their own functions, Cummins cannot distinguish functions from mere</page><page sequence="11">350 R. A. Segal / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 accidents—again, the problem of distinguishing functions from mere effects. Furthermore, the attribution of a function to even just all living things seems a return to anthropomorphism. Responses to Cummins abound. While published two years earlier than Cummins' article, Larry Wrights "Functions" (1973), followed by his "post Cummins" book Teleological Explanation (1976), has been enlisted to meet some of the problems in Cummins' analysis. Wright cites Hempel but lists him with half a dozen others and gives more attention to two of those others. Applied to Cummins, Wright is able, for example, to distinguish functions from accidental effects and is thereby saved from unavoidably finding a function for everything. The heart exists to pump blood. That it also makes noise is a mere effect. But Wright keeps functions distinct from sheer effects only by returning to the traditional notion of functional explanation as causal and of specific parts as having their own functions. The heart still exists to pump blood. In "In Defense of Proper Functions" (1989) and other works Ruth Millikan likewise returns to the traditional view of a functional explanation as causal. To solve the problem of backward causation that Wright ineluctably reintro duces, she enlists the distinction between types and tokens, or categories and instances. Instead of having to assert that pumping blood causes the heart to exist and persist, she asserts that the function of pumping blood is that of the category heart. Any member of that category, or family, inherits the function from its forbears, so that past tokens have a future effect on present ones. The past causes the present and not, as in backward causation, the reverse.13 V. Cummins' Functionalist» Applied to Explanations of Religion As philosophers rather than biologists or social scientists, Cummins, Wright, and Millikan are scarcely proposing new explanations, or theories, of living things or of religion. Rather, they are offering new ways of conceptualizing any theory. Let me sketch what a theory of religion from the standpoint of Cummins, the most radical of the three, would look like. Cummins aside, a theorist could still raise the issue of the origin of religion. If enough information existed, a theorist could offer a historical explanation of religion. Obviously, there are many historical explanations of specific religions. A theory would mean a historical explanation of religion per se. But ordinar ily, the origin that a theory gives is recurrent rather than historical. The claim 13 For the debate among Cummins, Wright, Millikan, and others, see Allen, Bekoff, and Lauder (1998).</page><page sequence="12">R. A. Segal/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 351 is not that religion originated in Africa but that religion anywhere and any time originates in the same way. The "same way" would commonly mean for the same reason, which would commonly mean to fulfill the same need. Are we, then, back to the fallacy of affirming the consequent? Not automatically. That fallacy lies not in the claim to know the origin—the recurrent origin—of religion but in the claim to know the origin on the sheer basis of the function. More precisely, the fallacy lies in the claim to know the necessary origin of religion on the sheer basis of the function. A theory could still vaunt the origin it gives as necessary, but only if it could rule out alternative possibilities. Unless a theory can do so, it is giving only a probabilistic explanation. Most explanations of human behav ior are probabilistic, but they are therefore inductive rather than deductive and so are immune to the deductive fallacy of affirming the consequent. Applied to religion, Cummins' approach to biology would skirt the issue of origin—even recurrent origin—altogether. A "Cumminsist" would do the opposite of honing in on religion and seeing what it does. The focus would not be on what religion itself does, and not even if religion were presented in its context, as has long been de rigueur. Placing religion in context usually means presenting the setting in which religion operates. The equivalent of the context for Cummins is functional. The context is not the usual one of who is religious, where religion takes place, and how religion manifests itself. The context is the ultimate function within which religion operates. Take an example. Max Weber (1963) maintains that "higher religion" serves to give meaningfulness to life, above all in the form of making sense of suffer ing. Religion offers a theodicy (see Weber 1963, ch. 9). Of course, Weber puts religion in context in the conventional sense of the word. Religion beyond the earliest, magical stage is the religion of a group, or "congregation." Religion takes place among self-conscious members of the group. Robinson Crusoe, if religious, would be religious at only the magical stage. His context, or situa tion, would preclude religiosity of any other kind. Only once there is a group can there be ethics, metaphysics, priests, and prophets. Brand of religion can also be matched up with class. Upper-class intellectuals are the class most concerned not with suffering, which is universal, but with a formal, systematic response to it: The salvation sought by the intellectual is always based on inner [versus material] need, and hence it is at once more remote from life, more theoretical and more systematic than salvation from any external distress, the quest for which is charac teristic of nonprivileged classes. The intellectual seeks in various ways... to endow his life with a pervasive meaning, and thus to find unity with himself, with his fellow men, and with the cosmos. It is the intellectual who transforms the concept of the world into the problem of meaning. (Weber 1963, 124-5)</page><page sequence="13">352 R. A. Segal / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 340-353 A Cummins-inspired approach, by contrast, would present Weber's theory differently. It would set the need for meaningfulness itself in the context of something bigger. If one were evolutionarily inclined, one would set it in the context of mental health, which would be tied to survival. To assert that reli gion abets mental health would be missing the point, which would be that religion must be linked to other institutions that do the same. Simply to assert that other things besides religion also contribute to mental health would like wise be missing the point, which would be that religion abets mental health only when it works together with other institutions. Religion could still be doing its distinctive "bit," but its bit would not amount to a function in its own right, any more than the production of part X by workers Y would amount to a function in its own right. The focus would be on the fitting of religion with other "components" along a single, meaning-producing assembly line. Perhaps religion contributes to meaningfulness by postulating god and attributing to god the world in which suffering occurs, a system of rewards and punishments, a soul, paradise, and life after death. Religion would be looked at practically. What can it do? would be the question. The conclusion of a Cummins-style functionalist explanation would not be that religion, either at one stage or always, functions to provide meaningfulness in life, let alone that religion arises to provide meaningfulness in life, not to say that existing meaningfulness in life is caused by religion. The conclusion would be that religion, like the beating heart, is part of a system that as a whole is capable of providing meaningfulness. Religion could have arisen for any reason, such as to provide food or to cure illness. The origin of religion would be decoupled from its present role. One would not merely be allowing for the creation of new needs in the course of the history of religions, as Weber does with the need for meaningfulness. One would not be considering religion as serving any need, be it an original need or a present need, let alone a distinctively religious need. Religion would be seen as doing something that it can do only because, however it got there, it is now part of a system far bigger than itself. If this approach to religion is not new, I will be much surprised. References Allen, Colin, Mark Bekoff, and George Lauder (eds.) (1998). Natures Purposes. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Arnal, William E.
