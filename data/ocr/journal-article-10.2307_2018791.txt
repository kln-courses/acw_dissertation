<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XXXV, No. 4 FEBRUARY 17, 1938 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY POSITIVISTIC AND ACTIVISTIC THEORIES OF CAUSATION H UME 'S account of causation has occasioned a variety of alleged refutations which claim to show that Hume ignored certain obvious features of experience. In this paper we would show (a) that much of the criticism leveled against Hume's argument is purely verbal and (b) that two theories of causation other than Hume's, one, viz. Kant's, was not really about causation; and the other which I shall designate ''empirical metaphysics" arises from a confusion of syntactical and synthetic sentences. In the sentence, "a caused b," "caused" is often taken to be synonymous with such words as "produced," "determined," and so forth, and it is claimed that these words are signs of certain elements deeply rooted in experience. Where Hume denied any validity to such words metaphysicians either invoke a higher law than the laws of the empirical sciences and repose their concepts in the bosom of a transcendental "some- thing," or else, when the "transcendental begins to weaken under such a burden, they endow the items of experience with whatever metaphysical properties are thought necessary to sustain the pro- ductive theory of causation. Where Hume is said to have been too abstract, this new version of empirical metaphysics is said to yield a concrete account of experience. Hlume's conclusion may be summarized thus: "No connection between so-called causes and effects ever is experienced; therefore, there is none. What connection there is is purely subjective. It is a connection between our idea of one object and our idea of an- other; when we have repeatedly observed that one sort of an object followed a certain other, we have thereby acquired a habit of mind, namely, the propensity which custom produces, to pass from one object to the idea of its usual attendant." 1 This explanation of causality is said by some critics to involve circularity. Mr. Loewenberg asks, "If custom can produce a pro- 1 Cf.

But, "produce," as Hume uses the word, to describe the acquisition of a habit, is certainly not synonymous with "produce" where one event is said to produce another. "Produce" in the former sense is an explanation of why we use language as we do. Production, in the sense that events are said to produce each other, is a speculation about the nature of the physical world. We can observe that people do employ the words "cause" and "effect" under just such circum- stances as Hume described; we can never observe one event produc- ing another. The alleged circularity, then, is rooted in the am- biguity of the word "produce." Professor Whitehead makes a similar criticism. Hume dis- missed necessity because he could find no impression for it. But, "fHume seems to have overlooked the difficulty that 'repetition ' stands with regard to 'impressions' in exactly the same position as does cause and effect. " 3 In other words, "Where is the impression for repetition?" The question is hardly fair. Suppose I have had, say, seven impressions of "b" following upon "a." I may count them, but I do not count the counting. Repetition stands merely for the possibility of enumerating the successive recurrences of impressions, "a" and "b." By observing that two events have recurred always, up to now, in regular sequence, I can form a class of these similar occur- rences. But I can not include the fact of recurrence as a member of the class of events that have recurred. Hence, I can not ask for an impression for repetition.4 Hume 's challenge to exhibit the necessary connection between cause and effect has never been successfully met; and his thesis can not be refuted by mer e verbal criticism.5 The transcendental metaphysics, especially as exemplified in Kant, offers no basis for refuting Hume. Kant agreed with Hume that there is no perception of necessary connection. Kant simply ignored necessity and changed the causal formula from necessary 2 "The Elasticity of the Idea of Causality," The Uni.versity of California Publications in.

Church, Hume's Theory of the Understanding, pp. 84-85. 5 It is true that Hume does not always seem consistent in his doctrine of constant conjunction. He admits the possibility of attaining a knowledge of cause and effect from the observation of a single instance of conjunction. See Treatise, Selby-Bigge, pp. 104-105. But this possibility does not depend upon our impression of a necessary connection.</page><page sequence="3">THEORIES OF CAUSATION 87 connection to irreversible succession. Kant did not answer Hume but rather agreed with him.6 Inasmuch as Kant saw the close relation between causation and order he made a valuable contribution to the solution of the causal problem. But when it is once clear how Kant reached his conclu- sion, it is evident that he was not referring to anything that is meaningful in the sense of being verifiable; causation for Kant is simply the command to judge causally. In the famous "Second Analogy" Kant illustrates his meaning in the familiar example of the ship gliding down stream.7 Here, he says, the order in which our perceptions of the moving ship succeed each other is objec- tively determined. But when I look at a house, I can, myself, determine the order in which the perceptions begin, i.e., there is no determinate order specifying at what point I must begin in order to connect the manifold. It would seem that Kant regards any order as objective which is not determined by the will of the sub- ject, and any order which is objective in this sense is also causal. But there is objective succession which is not at the same time a causal order.8 It is also the case that Kant is not interested in the bare fact of order but rather in showing what order we must accept. Since there are no "must" in nature we can not go to na- ture to confirm Kant's thesis and his argument is therefore futile. Kant 's causal theory is as empty as his celebrated Categorical Imperative. Professor Loewenberg remarks that Kant, as much as did Hume, finds the origin of causality in a human propensity. But, " not wishing to account for this propensity as caused by custom which would reduce it to a natural and contingent event, Kant enshrines it in the bosom of a transcendental self whose existence nothing but postulates and hopes can vouch for. " 9 Positivists, viz., Schliek, see nothing in Kant that threatens their own thesis. Schlick interprets Kant to mean only that causality is a Principle of Order. The objection to Kant arises from the non-empirical source of the order. See "Causality in Everyday-Life and in Science," by Moritz Schlick, The University of California Publications in Philosophy; Volume 15, pp. 109- 110. 7 See Critique of Pure Reason, N. K. Smith, p. 221. 8 Schopenhauer, in the Four Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, Bohn, pp. 103-104, remarks, "Just as I am leaving my house, a tile happens to fall from the roof which strikes me; now there is no causal connection what- ever between my going out and the falling of the tile; yet the order of their succession-that is that my going out preceded the falling of the tile-is objectively determined in my apprehension, not subjectively by my will, by which that order would otherwise have most likely been inverted." 9 J. Loewenberg, "The Elasticity of the Idea of Causality," University of California Publications in Philosophy, Volume 15, p. 21.</page><page sequence="4">88 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY But such is not peculiar to a transcendental metaphysic; all non-empirical theories of causation are equally liable to the same criticism if it can be shown that they are all equally non-sensical. Some philosophers, who do not accept transcendentalism, cling, however, to a belief in metaphysical entities, trusting that these alleged data are somehow observable in the physical world.10 In what follows we shall try to show that such words as "pro- duction," "necessity," "effectuality, " and " intimacy " do not designate any observable features of the physical world. A sentence is directly verified if it is tested by present percep- tion, e.g., "I now see a red patch on a blue ground." Some sen- tences are only indirectly verifiable. Professor Carnap illustrates indirect verification in the sentence (P), "This key is made of iron." 11 He shows that the sentence is indirectly verified by direct verification of sentences deduced from (P) together with other al- ready verified sentences. We know that if iron is placed near a magnet it is attracted; a magnet is provided and the key is placed near the bar; as a result we can predict, "the key will now be at- tracted by the bar." If we say the magnet causes the key to move in a certain direction, we can never observe anything but the motion of the key. If a philosopher persists in his assertion that "force" is involved, we can only ask him, "what test can you provide by which we can observe this force?" If no test is forthcoming then we have no means of knowing what the philosopher is talking about. Inasmuch as our philosopher is not speaking about a real object he is not making an assertion but merely utters a series of words.12 "The word cause, as used in every day life, implies nothing but regularity of sequence, because nothing else is used to verify the propositions in which it occurs. " 13 Now, some writers on the causal problem admit the hypothetical character of universal sentences but insist that such singular sen- tences as, "x now causes y" or "x caused y yesterday" are cer- tain. Loewenberg, for instance, distinguishes causation and causal- ity.14 Causation, he says, concerns such singular sentences as "the impact of this ball caused that ball to move." But causality in- volves such sentences. as, "x always causes y" and of course such a sentence will never be completely verified. It is Mr. Loewenberg's 10 Viz.) S. Alexander, Space, Time and Deity; Volume I, p. 4. He insists that the non-empirical is experienced and defines philosophy as the "empirical study of the non-empirical. " 11 R.

But it is here contended that we must also have " causality" in Mr. Loewenberg 's sense of that word, before we can make any sense of the word "causation. " We are often tempted to believe that the occurrence of an in- stance of a causal relation is a hard fact, independent of any other observation. But suppose a person were told that a certain medi- cine caused a patient to recover. Now, suppose this same person asks for some evidence that this medicine really caused the patient's recovery. It would seem that the only possible reply would consist in pointing to past successes with similar patients who took the same kind of medicine. In other words, it is only because we have "causality" in Mr. Loewenberg's intended meaning of a belief in uniformity, that we can ever defend our faith in a single instance of a causal relation. When we assert (a) "x caused y to-day" it is only because we have made sufficient observations of such x's and y's to lead us to (b) "x causes y." Either causation and causality are one, or, if we make causal judgments, ignoring past uniformity, we may be driven to admit a mere chance connection between the given terms; and chance is the negation of the belief in causal efficacy. We can not conclude, therefore, that there is any basis for dis- tinguishing causation and causality on the ground that the former is existential. What existential import causation has rests on the terms, not the relation; causation and causality are words for the same relation and the distinction between them is a mere difference of words. It is not unusual for philosophers to yield certain points to the positivist doctrine as though yielding some of the usual elements of the productive theory would add strength to the remaining ones. As a further example of such strategy Mr. Dennes argues that we may retain the notion of production as the essence of cause even though we must give up necessary connection. He writes, "It is a complete mistake to suppose . . . that if we experience force we experience necessitation, and if we do not ex- perience necessitation we do not experience force." 15 It is granted at once that we do not experience "necessity" as we experience the objects in our spatio-temporal environment. Ne- cessity is a product of definition and can occur only in analytic sentences. In demonstration we can show a theorem to be a neces- 15 W. R. Dennes, "Causation as Continuity and Production," The Uni- versity of California Publications in Philosophy, Volume 15, p. 161.</page><page sequence="6">90 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sary consequence of certain axioms and certain transformative rules. But "force" as intended in the above quotation either is or is not an aspect of the physical world and is a candidate for verifi- cation. Nothing is gained for "force" by admitting that "neces- sity" is a syntactical term.'6 The whole point is, how do we ex- perience force? Certainly the advocates of such a doctrine refer to more than the force of demonstration-to more than mere language. But Mr. Dennes, nevertheless, proceeds to the search for force and finds it in our capacity to vary language. In other words, in the long passage from primitive animism to the present modern views of causation a certain effort has been required in changing the causal formula. But it was my impression that the "activists" de- cried the whole syntactical theory of philosophy and sought in- stead, an ontological basis for production. A further instance of the purely verbal account of the produc- tion theory of causatioln is to be found in the doctrine of substance.17 Causation then becomes the inward process of substance. Broad, for instance, identifies substance with particularity. He seems to mean that in the sentence, "this is red and triangular," that what is being talked about is not merely redness and triangularity but also particularity. To say, "this is particular" is no more meanl- ingful than to say "this is a thing." When we say, "the table is a thing" we are not uttering a synthetic sentence. No act is re- quired to verify the sentence, as it would be were we to say, "the table is red." The sentence, therefore, "this is a substance," is analytic and says nothing about the world. Professor Carnap has shown how all sentences such as, "The rose is a thing" are cor- rectly rendered; "The word 'rose' is a thing-word." All such sen- tences are syntactical sentences, i.e., concern only linguistic forms. 18 But these philosophers, having dragged in substance in order to explain causation, decide that after all it is not the direct causal factor-events are causes. Broad, for instance, prefers to say that the cause is an event happening in a certain substance. The effect is an event happen- ing to a certain substance, as when the motion in the stone does something to the windowpane.'9 Though causes are events, it is never possible to isolate events. The arbitrary selection of any single event as cause, while satisfy- ing practical purposes, is not acceptable to the procedure of science. 16 It is, of course, a mistake to even look for an impression of necessity as Hume did. 17 See S.

We can not conveniently drop the word "event" as it appears in our coarser everyday language. But the events that interest the scientist are finer and so close together that he can do little more than refer to a whole series of events. If he wants to convey his meaning in popular language, he may resort to the cruder expressions that the layman must depend upon. In such a case, he may designate a series of events, "the cause of," thereby suggesting that the cause is a single event. But all the scientist ever finds is more and more events. Metaphysicians, not satisfied with this analysis, would try to find some sort of entity along which events are strung, much as beads are connected on a string. They then endow the string with some magical force that keeps the events dynamic and intimate one with the other. If the positivist insists that only events are found in the world, then he is likely to be told that, if by definition there is nothing in the world but events, then it is useless to look for any- thing else. But it is not by definition that the world consists of events, such is the delivery of tested experience. The scientist is not dealing with purely syntactical sentences as is the logicialn, nor is he toying with the pseudo-object sentences of metaphysics. He is concerned with real-object sentences and such sentences are not yielded by mere definition. It is more nearly true to turn the tables and show wherein the productive theory of causation is a mere product of linguistic invention-using words where no things are found. It is the privilege of the "muddle-headed" tradition to cry out against the "simple-minded." They argue that we must under- stand the whole, the system, the cosmos-' 'believing where we can- not prove." Mr. Mackay, arguing in this vein, pleads that iso- lated events are not intelligible and must be explained only in an appropriate context.21 The historian, for example, must catch the spirit of the age, if he would interpret cause and effect in history. But it is difficult to see how the spirit of the age is much more than what the historian reads into it. As Spinoza observed, what Peter 20 Op. cit., p. 111. 21 D. S.

His- torians of the Marxist Tradition, the Agrarian, or the Genteel Tra- dition, can use the identical events of the American Civil War and come out with three histories of that conflict. Though it is true that the difficulty in employing causal explanations in history is due to the imnpossibility of isolating events, this impossibility exists not because events are imprisoned in a context, but rather because the events are so close together that we must take a whole string of events at once, and even then we don't know where to begin.22 The whole point at issue between the positivist and productive theories of causation appears to reduce to a single question: "Can the empiricist begin his work without first constructing some theory of the cosmos? " The most plausible answer demands another question: "Can such words as 'absolute,' 'reality,' etc., function as the subject of real-object sentences? " When the scientist as- serts the reality of somethilng he is saying that the object concerned can be found at some definite time and place. He refers his object to the physical world and his assertion is therefore verifiable and meaningful. But a sentence such as "Reality is dynamic" is mean- ingless because we are not told how to verify it.23 But suppose that instead of sentences like "the Universe is dy- namic" we take sentences that involve real-objects, such as colncern the scientist. Now, can we predicate "force" of such objects? If I say, "a is active in relation to b," can I deduce anything from the statement about future perceptions? If it has been ob- served on a number of occasions that b follows a with unfailing regularity, then I can predict similar phenomena. But whatever is said about a's enforcing b or producing b is entirely devoid of any predictive value. Successful prediction is the single criterion for judging a causal relation. The only basis we have for such prediction is our obser- vation of the regularity of succession. But there is no answer to the question, "How many times must we make the observation?" It is impossible to formulate any rule; seven times or seventy times seven would be far from safe; we simply grow in faith as the num- ber of observations increases. We never observe determination between events, but as Schlick observes, a definite sense can be giveln "determination" within the positivist theory.24 Determination means the ability to calculate the effect if the cause is known. But, 22 Cf. Charles A. Beard, " The Devil Theory of History and War, ' New Republic, March 4, 1936.

Where determination is given the sense of calculation the dis- tinctioni between causation and teleology disappears. We can not nlow say that causation is always a tergo, whereas in purposeful activ- ity the cause is in the future. For by this interpretation causation becomes symmetrical; causes may be calculated from their effects as well as effects from causes and the future may be said to determine the past as well as the past determines the future.25 The productive theory of causation seems to rest upon a coni- fusion between science and art. The artist expresses what he feels; perhaps he can arouse a similar feeling in his audience. But having "felt" the emotive meaning that the artist intends, there is naught to do "but consider and bow the head." The scientist, on the other hand, speaks in a language which al- lows confirmation and he may provide a method whereby we can test his sentences. It would be non-sense to make any value judgments on the rela- tive merit of art and science. Truth is not beauty; the two can not even be compared. But the philosopher, undecided whether to be poet or scientist, too frequently employs the language of poetry in discussing the nature of the physical world. He thereby endows nature with his own feelings and keeps alive the anthropomorphic tendency that he ascribes to primitive man. BRUCE WATERS.
