<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME NUBIAN ROCK PICTURES. By J, H. Dunbar, M.C. (PLATES XI &amp; XII.) PERHAPS a few of the readers points of that Sudan have Notes arisen and during Records correspondence will be interested and dis- in a few of the points that have arisen during correspondence and dis- cussion on my paper, " Some Nubian Rock Pictures," which appeared in Vol. XVII, Part II, 1934. Mr. E. S. Thomas, of the Pitt Rivers Museum, wrote asking if I had seen, on the Nubian rocks, any signs, particularly anthropomorphic signs, such as those illustrated in his paper, " A Comparison of Drawings from Ancient Egypt, Libya, and the South Spanish Caves" (Jour. Roy. Anthr. Inst., Vol LVI, 1926, pp. 385-394). Although I was familiar with this paper I was unable to make any reference to it as I did not read it until after my own article was in the press. On the accom- panying Plates, Figs. 1-38, are included such designs as I have found on the rocks in Lower Nubia. I had in mind Nos. 1-14 when I wrote of human figures that were in a state of poise, or in the familiar Hadendoa attitude, or that resembled camel brands and letters of the Tifinagh alphabet. Nos. 7, 8 and 9 might be dancing perhaps. Nos. 3-6 are the most common and suggest Libyan affinities. Similar figures are found incised on Middle Nubian or C-Group pottery. No. 5 seems to be the oldest, on the rocks, and from the weathering, I should date it to pre- dynastic times. It will be seen that No. 5 is in the " pecked " technique. I ought to make it clear that none of the figures shown on the Plate are, comparatively, plentiful. For every one of even the commonest of these figures, there are hundreds of rock pictures of animals and boats, while Nos. 10 and 20 are, so far, unique. Nos. 18, 23, 31 and 32 may be particularly mentioned in connection with Mr. E. S. Thomas' paper. No. 18, of which I have found two examples on the rocks, bota extremely well drawn, seems to be very widely known. In this form of the penta- gram, or true pentade, and in the form of two intersecting equilateral triangles it is familiar to native magicians as " The Seal of Solomon," though it certainly goes back nearly 3,000 years beyond Solomon, for it is incised on protodynastic pottery from Faras. It is also on the Babylonian pottery, c. 2500 b.c. from Jamdat Nasr. It is inscribed</page><page sequence="2">304 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS on a stone object amongst the Coptic Antiquities in the British Museum and I have seen it worn as a badge by a racecourse tipster at Epsom. No. 23, the " grating " pattern, being so often associated with animals, has been regarded as representing a pitfall or an enclosure. The " gratings " that I have seen on the Nubian rocks are not in associ- ation with animals and, as they are on the flat, I think that Nos. 23 and 24 (cup-stones) might have been used for such games as one can see played to-day in Egypt and the Sudan. Perhaps they were used for divination. (For this and other interesting points see " Mysteries of the Libyan Desert," Appendix III. W. J. Harding King, 1925.) On the other hand I have seen a rock picture of a giraffe which seemed to be caught by the foot in a spiked wheel-trap. Nos. 31 and 32 are not Nubian petroglyphs, but are copied from Thomas (op. cit.) and represent head-dresses, No. 31 being from Southern Spain (Early Neolithic), and No. 32 from prehistoric Egypt. I mention these to introduce No. 33, which is a design on present-day Sudani needlework. No. 34 is from Middle Nubian or C-Group pottery and No. 35 is from the present-day Sudani needlework designs, as are also Nos. 36, 37 and 38. The vertical, horizontal, and zig-zag lines are intended to represent the stitches of the needlework. There can be no doubt that these needlework patterns are very old. Some of them may be anthropomorphic, and it is even possible that their origins are to be sought in rock pictures and in pottery marks. I have seen half-a-dozen examples of Nos. 15, 16 and 17, on the Nubian rocks and near them are some crosses, presumably Christian. No. 15 is matched, and No. 21 is also found, among the scratchings on " Medieval Potsherds from Christian Sites in the Dongola Province " in the Gordon College Museum. No. 20 is a petroglyph from Toshki East. The " bow and arrow " part of it is rather like a Meroitic pottery decoration. Compare it also with No. 21, already mentioned as a scratching on a Christian pot. Nos. 29 and 30 I found, cut on the rocks, up the Wadi Hammamat along the Luxor-Kosseir road, and near them was an example of the true pentade. Compare No. 29 with No. 20 and No. 30 with No. 1. No. 22 is a Christian sign cut, not in the naked rock, but over the door- way of the church inside the temple of Wadi es Siboua. Compare the lower half of this with No. 16.</page><page sequence="3">Sudan Notes and Records.

Apart from their frequent association with crosses one would see in them a Christian influence for they seem to include variants of the Alpha and Omega and other Coptic sacred symbols. Of No. 19 there are three examples on the rocks at Gerf Hussein, about half a mile north of the temple. One of them is so beautifully done that it might be the work of a craftsman employed on the temple. This design is incised on both the protodynastic and C-Group pottery from Lower Nubia. Nos. 25-28 are lightly scratched on the rocks, No. 25 at Derr, and Nos. 26-28 at Armena. Is it possible that No. 26 is a Trinitarian sign of the Christian period ? In the course of a long and interesting letter, Mr. J. F. E. Bloss, Sudan Medical Service, describing some rock pictures he found during the summer of 1934 at the oasis of Merga, some 300 miles south-west of Selima, wrote : " The oasis is at the southern end of a wadi, called Wadi Hussein. At the northern end of this wadi there are a few small sand- stone hills of a pinkish colour, one of which is marked on the maps as the Sphinx Rock. In a cave-like depression at the top of a small gebel near the Sphinx Rock there are some rock pictures. The cave is on the southern side of the gebel and is about 12 feet high and 10 feet wide. The drawings represent antelope of various kinds and also cattle, both the large horn kind and the small horn kind. The drawings are all line drawings scratched with deep lines in the soft sandstone. Giraffe, and in one place what appeared to be giraffe feeding off the tops of palm trees, were also there. In another corner we saw what we thought was a baboon sitting down, though of course this might possibly have been something else. The size of the drawings was variable. The giraffes were as much as two feet high and the cattle were as long as about 15 to 18 eighteen inches. The rock was well weathered and there were traces of other line drawings that were too indefinite to be identified." From what Mr. Bloss writes of the weathering, the disappearance of the oldest drawings, and the subject-matter of the pictures, one has reason to suppose that the shelter was occupied very long ago and over a very considerable period. With his letter Mr. Bloss most kindly sent me a very clear photograph on which are shown a dozen bulls and a giraffe. There is one case of superposition in which the legs of a bull cut the back 10</page><page sequence="6">3o6 sudan notes and records of a giraffe. The most interesting feature of the photograph is the marking on two of the bulls. Down the flanks of these bulls are two parallel and vertical lines. There is a good example of this marking in the top figure on Plate VIII of my paper. Mr. L. P. Kirwan, the present director of the Oxford University Expedition in the Sudan, tells me that such markings are of frequent occurrence on the bulls incised on certain pottery vessels of the so-called " C-Groups " from Lower Nubia. The type of vessel upon which these drawings of bulls occur seems to be roughly contemporary with the Twelfth Dynasty in Egypt (c. 2000-1790 b.c.)." Mr. G. O. Whitehead who, with Mr. F. Addison, contributed " Meroitic Remains " to Sudan Notes and Records , Vol. IX, No. 2, 1926, very kindly sent me some photographs that he took in 1927. They show rock pictures of giraffes at Gebel Geili and graffiti on the walls of Mussawarat es Sufra. From what Mr. Whitehead tells me I think the giraffe rock pictures are the same as those mentioned by Mr. J. W. Crowfoot in " Old Sites in the Butana " {Sudan Notes and Records , Vol. Ill, No. 2, 1920). The upper limit of the graffiti can be fixed by the date of the building but one does not see such graffiti on the temples in Nubia. Except for a few drawings of camels by British Tommies in Expedition days, the only scrib- blings I have seen on the temples in Nubia are confined to names, initials and dates, and very few of these are more than 100 years old. There are numerous Christian paintings and prayers on the walls of the old temples, but I do not count these as graffiti. I have had several letters from Mr. A. E. Robinson, late Sudan Civil Service, in one of which he writes, " I think that the elephant and giraffe probably roamed on the western banks of the Nile as late as the early dynastic period, as far north as the cattle countries of the Wawat, Mentiu, etc. The local conditions then would be similar to those in the Gezireh from February to May, when elephant used to roam near Sennar and go to the Blue Nile to drink in the last century, as late as 1890." When I wrote my paper I had not seen Mr. Robinson's " Rock Pictures" {Journal of the African Society , October, 1934)- Every- one interested in prehistory should read it. Mr. Robinson's chief concern with rock pictures is, at the moment, the bearing they may have on the history of the camel. Such a difficult and complicated question is far beyond the scope of this letter, but I am collecting what petroglyphic</page><page sequence="7">SOME NUBIAN ROCK PICTURES 307 evidence I can in Nubia. I understand that there will shortly appear, in The Journal of the African Society , a paper on the camel by Mr. Robinson. Since you published my " Some Nubian Rock Pictures " I have been fortunate enough to find many new pictures and to have opportunities of revisiting the old sites. Broadly speaking, the fresh evidence confirms what I have already written, though there may have to be minor modi- fications in a few instances. I am now engaged in plotting the levels of all the pictures, but more than ever I feel " there remains quite an amount of work to be done before the last word can be written on the Nubian petroglyphs."
