<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Cheerful Nihilism: Confidence and the Absurd in American Humorous Fiction. By Richard Boyd Hauck. Bloomington, Ind.: University of Indiana. 1971 . xiv, 269 pp. $9.50. Richard Boyd Hauck has written a thematic study of "The Absurd" in American literary humor. His book is addressed to the knowledgeable 124</page><page sequence="2">reader rather than the specialist. Divided into eight chapters, Hauck's study begins with an essay on the American Sisyphus, the representative American writer who creatively laughs at nihilism. In the following chapters, Hauck groups Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Franklin, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, William Faulkner, and John Barth, all chosen for their consciousness of the absurd, with frontier humorists such as Henry Clay Lewis, John S. Robb, Augustus Baldwin Lo ngstreet, William Tappan Thompson, and Thomas Bangs Thorpe. The most rewarding sections in A Cheerful Nihilism are those on frontier and contemporary humorists. Hauck has done substantial work on some little known frontier writers whose works appeared in Spirit of the Times. His application of Albert Camus's definition of absurdity in The Myth of Sisyphus to the productions of the frontier works smoothly enough as does his application of the myth to the novels of John Barth, in particular to either extant edition of The Floating Opera. Todd Andrews confronts Gamus's first question of suicide and finds little reason either to die or to live. In short, he finds no reason and arbitrarily decides to live in the second version. In the first version he feels interest in the fate of a convulsing child and takes that unsuspected feeling to be, in part, a hopeful reason to live. Hauck is less successful, however, in his analysis of Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Franklin, and Mark Twain. Jonathan Edwards, maintains Hauck, soberly created a solution to his awareness of absurdity, fully aware, as Camus was aware, of the absurdity of creating a human solution. Edwards, however, was working within the confines of the Puritan cosmos, and the abyss beneath his feet was quite literally hell, not the abyss of contemporary consciousness. Benjamin Franklin, explains Hauck, was a confidence man, in that he was a self-made man who created himself with full knowledge of the alternatives to confidence: in modern terms, pessimism and death. If by imitating Socrates and Jesus, Franklin can evince humility, and humility is a valuable trait in society, then Franklin will imitate. In Hauck's thesis, Franklin will consciously and absurdly create meaning in a meaningless universe. Franklin, however, was an eighteenth-century Deist confident of the powers of man and man's reason. His belief in mankind is echoed by Faulkner's belief that man will endure. Franklin's self-confidence followed naturally from the nature of existence as he saw it. Finally, the man who fits Hauck's thesis least is Mark Twain. One cannot quarrel with Hauck's observations about Mark Twain's ambivalence toward purposefulness and purposelessness; one can hardly differ with Hauck's generalization that Twain wrote "serious comedy." What is disturbing is Hauck's almost casual assumption that Mark Twain was at home among philosophical niceties as he was with the frontier yarn. Far from a trained, rigorous thinker, Twain was a writer of profound imagination and huge comic sense, who in old age professed a profound despair at the nature of man, fate, and the anthropomorphic Christian 125</page><page sequence="3">God. The Connecticut Yankee is far more complex a work than Hauck delineates; since the definitive work of Henry Nash Smith, Mark Twain's Fable of Progress , the novel has been viewed, as one of Hauck's notes says, as emblematic of " 'absolute despair.' " But paradoxically, Twain habitually juxtaposed burlesque humor and light-hearted parody with hopeless passages, playing havoc with the tone of works from Huck Finn to the Mysterious Stranger (now known as Chronicle of Young Satan). A Cheerful Nihilism is provocatively titled and executed; its treatment of modern artistic consciousness is fairly sound. Its merit is that it raises new arguments among students of humor in America.
