<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chich?n Itz?'s legacy in the astronomically oriented architecture of Mayap?n ANTHONY F. AVENI, SUSAN MILBRATH, and CARLOS PERAZA LOPE They surrounded it with a very broad stone wall, laid dry of about an eighth of a league leaving in it only two narrow gates. The wall was not very high and in the centre of this enclosure they built their temples, naming the largest, which is like that of Chichen Itza, the name of Kukulcan and they built another building of a round form, with four doors, entirely different from all others in that land. ?Diego de Landa (Tozzer 1941:24-25) This is how the sixteenth-century bishop of Yucat?n, Diego de Landa, described construction of the walled city of Mayap?n. The new city became the northern Maya capital after the fall of Chich?n Itz?, a city 100 km to the east, still famous in the seventeenth century when another Spanish chronicler described its "great and magnificent buildings of mortar, rough and dressed masonry and figures and statues of worked stone . . . which one sees today and which can [still] be lived in."1 Chich?n Itz?'s mammoth Maya-Toltec architecture was developed largely during the Terminal Classic, a period beginning around a.d. 800 and extending possibly as late as a.d. 1050 (Andrews et al. 2003). The two famous Maya buildings referred to by Bishop Landa, the Round Temple and the Castillo (or Temple of Kukulcan), both incorporate in their architectural plan certain calendrical and astronomical principles regarded as fundamental to the Maya world view. As inquisitor historian Landa implies, the Mayap?n version of the Temple of Kukulcan was a copy intended to reflect the grandeur of earlier days, when the Itz?s dominated the Maya city states of north Yucat?n and ruled from Chich?n before its fall due to inter-city warfare. Oddly enough, Landa described Mayap?n's Round Temple as unique, when in fact it also closely follows the form of the Caracol at Chich?n Itz?. This study, made possible by recent excavations and reconstruction at Mayap?n under the direction of Carlos Peraza Lope, one of the authors, reveals just how precisely the act of replication proceeded and where subtle details were altered to reflect revisions that emanated from Mayap?n ideology. Our inquiry offers new knowledge of the history of the Maya calendar and the science of astronomy. The degree of cultural continuity we find as one passes from the Maya Classic to the Postclassic (900-1542)2 helps us to comprehend further the role of cosmically timed rituals, such as those that may have related to ancestor worship and the role of the gods in sustaining the relationship between nature and society (Milbrath 1999:85-87, 207-208, 234, 286-288). Archetypes: The square and the round at Chich?n Itz? Of the tallest building at Chich?n Itz?3 Landa writes: "This building has four staircases, which face the four points of the compass. Each of them is thirty-three feet wide and has ninety-one steps, so that it is extremely trying to climb them ... At the time when I saw it, there was at the foot of each balustrade a fierce mouth of a serpent, all of one piece and very (carefully) carved" (Tozzer 1941:178). This pyramid is called the Castillo or Temple of Kukulcan, named for the feathered serpent god of rebirth and creativity (Aveni 2001:186, 353 n. 37), which is also represented by decorated columns at the entry to the temple on the pyramid's summit (fig. 1). This impressive structure with nine levels or terraces, situated in the midst of a vast open plaza, takes the form of a stepped radial pyramid, one of three at Chich?n.4 Stairways at the middle of each of the four faces give access to a separate entry to the temple at the top, but the principal fa?ade faces north with a serpent-column We are grateful to the Instituto Nacional Antropolog?a y Historia, Mexico, especially to the formal regional director of Yucat?n Alfredo Barrera Rubio, for permission to make measurements with the surveyor's transit at Mayap?n during the month of January 2001, and to Colgate University's Extended Study Program for funding the project.

The Terminal Classic in Yucat?n was traditionally dated to a.d. 800-1000 in the literature of the 1980s. More recently, the fall of Chich?n Itz? is seen as the dividing point between the Classic and Postclassic. Some place the fall of Chich?n Itz? as late as a.d. 1200, but there is growing evidence that the site collapsed around a.d. 1050 or 1000 (Andrews et al. 2003; Ringle et al. 1998). Rafael Cobos (2001:186) dates the Terminal Classic between a.d. 900-1050, based on his excavations at Chich?n Itz?. 3. Height: 32 m including the temple on top; base dimension 58 m on a side. 4.

An interior stepped pyramid, known as the Castillo-sub, contains the same number of layers and possesses the same orientation as the outer structure.5 An altar in the shape of a Chacmool6 along with a red jaguar throne and offerings were discovered within (Miller 1985:7, pi. 15). Chich?n Itz?'s second-most famous building is the Caracol, or "Observatory," located 400 m to the south and west of the Castillo (fig. 2a; see also the site plan in fig. 5). Built over a long period of time, this structure was completed by the late ninth or early tenth century.7 Its location may have been used to establish the positions of several structures in the northern part of the site (Aveni et al. 1975:977-978, n. 12). It consists of a lower platform 52 m east-west by 67 m north-south rising 6 m above the flat landscape. This is topped by an upper platform of dimensions 22 m east-west by 24 m north-south, which is skewed noticeably counter clockwise from the lower platform. The building's blatant asymmetries, quite evident in the plan, have given rise to some unfortunate comments in the 5. Based on a study of the extant map, Aveni concludes it is likely that the light and shadow phenomenon to be discussed below also could have developed in the interior structure. 6. Chacmool sculptures represent anthropomorphic figures seated on the ground with the upper back raised, legs drawn up to the buttocks, and arms over the stomach holding a disk or plate for offerings. Augustus Le Plongeon, a nineteenth-century archaeologist working at Chich?n Itz?, so named the sculptures because he believed they represented a "warrior-prince" whose name was derived from an archaic Yucatec word for puma (Desmond 2000). 7. The date is based on associated Sotuta phase (800-1050/1100) ceramics and ninth-century dates inscribed on a dedicatory panel; see Garc?a Campillo 2000:44-58; Milbrath and Peraza (2003:21). Sotuta ceramics fade away between 1050 and 1100 when Hocaba ceramics are introduced at Chich?n Itz? (Andrews et al. 2003). The observation tower, the last part of the construction, has predominantly Sotuta ceramics classified as "Early Mexican Phase" by Brainerd (1958:36-37). The presumed Mexican influence now seems uncertain, and the Sotuta ceramic complex at Chich?n apparently developed locally at Chich?n Itz?, according to Cobos (1997:791). The observatory continued to be used throughout the Mayap?n period, as evidenced by offerings of Tases phase (1250/1300-1450) ceramics.</page><page sequence="3">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 125 Figure 1b.

For example, "Every city sooner or later erects some atrocious building that turns the stomach: London has its Albert Hall; New York, its Grant's Tomb; and Harvard, its Memorial Hall. If one can free oneself of the enchantment which antiquity ?s likely to induce and contemplate this building in all its horror from a strictly esthetic point of view, one will find that none of these is quite so hideous as the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? ... It stands like a two-decker wedding cake on the square carton in which it came. Something was pretty clearly wrong with the taste of the architects who built it." (Thompson 1945:10). 9. Pollock (1936:98-101, fig. 33) describes the stages of construction and dimensions of the tower. His section plan shows the walls of the upper story were around 3 m thick. Other round structures in Yucat?n are a good deal simpler (Aveni and H?rtung 1978). Pollock (pp. 5-35) also cites colonial Central Mexican sources referring to wind symbolism.</page><page sequence="5">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 127 Figure 3.

Photo by Carlos Peraza Lope. passage which opens, via four more doorways, into a solid core at the center of the tower. There one encounters a narrow passageway starting 3 m above the floor, which winds upward nearly one full turn10 to a partially fallen chamber (original dimensions approx. 2.5 x 2.5 m) at the top. The walls of this chamber were perforated by narrow horizontal openings,11 which have been studied as devices to sight astronomical phenomena at the horizon. The plan in figure 2b reveals a number of curious asymmetries. The front outer (west) doorway is not lined up with the direction of the stairway of the upper platform, and the outer doorways are not centered relative to the cardinal directions. Moreover, the inner doorways are only approximately equally spaced and they are placed not quite midway between the outer doors. The three surviving windows are all located on the western side of the tower, the northernmost (outer dimensions 0.75 m wide by 0.95 m high) being considerably larger than the other two (0.28 x 0.28 m, for the two other windows). Our 1975 study concluded that the Caracol of Chich?n Itz?, "apart from being a monument related to Quetzalcoatl was erected primarily for embodying in its architecture certain significant astronomical event alignments" (Aveni et al. 1975:985). We argued that alignments through the windows as well as those incorporating many of the architectural asymmetries delineated above were a deliberate part of the design program of the building. Replicas: The Castillo and Round Temple of Mayap?n The Castillo, designated as Structure Q162 by the Carnegie excavators (fig. 3), is the largest building at Mayap?n.12 Its similarity to the Castillo of Chich?n Itz? has long been recognized. The Mayap?n structure too 10. It is from this helical passageway, which imitates the shape of a snail's shell (caracol in Spanish), that the structure has acquired its modern name. 11. These artifacts were first called "windows" by Ruppert (1929:306), who excavated the structure. Because the south and southwest openings with sighting shafts are recessed with respect to the outer wall, Pollock (1936:101) referred to them as "dummy windows." Aveni et al. (1975) constitutes the first detailed study of the window orientations. 12.

Photo by Susan Milbrath. contains a buried pyramid discovered by the Carnegie excavation team and more thoroughly explored in recent excavations.13 The serpent-headed stairway is positioned only on the north side of the building, which is topped by a north-facing temple with serpent columns. This virtually duplicates the form and iconography found in the Castillo at Chich?n Itz?. One exception is the Mayap?n pyramid's slightly rounded shape (compare figs. 1 b and 6), accentuated by the fact that the four sides bulge slightly outward at each of the stairways relative to the corners. Also the E-W-facing sides are slightly longer than those facing N-S. The building likely once stood free of other structures, but in its final stage (Q162) two sizeable colonnaded halls were added east (Q161 ) and west (Q163) of the base. These structures survived in a ruined state, along with many of the other buildings, in part because the city had been thoroughly sacked in the mid-fifteenth century before the arrival of the Spaniards. The Round Temple of Mayap?n (Str, Q152, fig. 4; see also plan of fig. 6) is the largest of four circular structures at the site, such structures being comparatively rare in the Maya area.14 In an earlier pre-excavation report (Aveni and H?rtung 1978) we noted historical descriptions and drawings of Mayap?n's Round Temple made before the 1867 lightning strike obliterated what was left of the building since the sacking of the city. The diameter of its tower (10.2 m) is quite close to that of the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? (11.0 m). Unlike its counterpart, Q152 is situated upon a single-stage platform, rather than a two-deck platform.15 The structure has unusually thick walls (1.15 m wide). Its vaulted masonry consists mostly of thick corbelled slabs. 13. Excavations of the inner pyramid revealed elaborate reliefs depicting figures with niches in place of their heads. The niches contained traces of cranial bones, indicating that actual skulls were used to represent the heads of the frontal figures. Profile figures seem to represent subordinates and animals, most notably two vultures that resemble those represented in the Dresden Codex (Milbrath and Peraza, 2003:18). 14. Two round temples (Q126, Q214) have only a single door, whereas Q152 and H18 have four doors. (Chowning 1956; Shook 1955). A second tower at Chich?n has only a single door (Aveni and H?rtung 1978:136). 15. Landa (Tozzer 1941:23) refers to the round structure of Mayap?n as having been built by Kukulcan himself. Pollock (1936 159-160) concludes that both the Mayap?n and Chich?n structures were dedicated to the worship of that deity.</page><page sequence="7">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 129 The round temple is 7.25 m high as it is reconstructed (its full height is not certain), with a solid core 4.50 m in diameter surrounded by a vaulted chamber 2.75 m wide. Contrasting Castillos: Calendrical symbolism and cosmic hierophanies The Castillo of Chich?n Itz? is a paragon of geometrical and astronomical expression.16 Its proportions and orientation are rife with numbers and directions that strongly support the hypothesis that both the building and the vast open space that surrounds it constituted a special place for conducting seasonal rites related to the perpetuation of the Maya concept of cyclic time. This stepped radial pyramid possesses nine terraces, the same as the number of levels of the Maya underworld. Divided by a stairway, each side contains eighteen such layers, which is equal to the number of twenty-day months in a Maya year. From above (cf. fig. 1 b) it resembles the quadripartite diagrams of the universe that the ancient Mesoamericans painted in their codices, which show the four directional gods, plants, animals, day-names, etc. (fig. 12; Aveni 2001:140, 300; Paxton 2001). Fifty-two recessed panels decorate both sides of each stairway, the same as the number of years in a calendar round, the shortest interval in which the seasonal year is commensurate with the tzolkin or sacred round of 260 days; i.e. 52 x 365 = 73 x 260.17 Finally there are ninety-one steps on each of the four sides, which together tally the number of days in the "computing year" of 364 days, used widely in mathematical calculations in seasonal almanacs in the codices.18 Carlson (1999:146-152) has argued that the Castillo originally functioned in a calendrical ritual capacity in the context of the ancient four-directional New Year (Uayeb) festival cycle, which was conducted during the last five days of the 18 x 20 + 5-day seasonal calendar. The four sides may represent the four years of the calendric cycle of fifty-two years (13x4 years), each side devoted to a different direction and its Figure 5. Chich?n Itz?, site plan, showing the relative location of the Castillo and Caracol. After Sylvanus Morley, The Ancient Maya (Palo Alto, Stanford University Press, 1956), fig. 39. associated yearbearer, as described in Landa's account of the calendar. Our measurements (Aveni 2001) of the buildings' alignments,19 taken with a surveyor's transit and astronomical fix, revealed that the north-south axis of the pyramid is aligned 21?12' E of north. This places the west face of the pyramid within 4 degrees of the June solstice sunset position, but only 1 degree, 11 minutes off that on the dates of the passage of the sun across the zenith (May 24 and July 19 at the latitude of Chich?n 16. Much speculation on this topic can be found in the literature. For a review, see Aveni (2002). 17. This cycle, which permutes twenty day-names with coefficients numbering from one to thirteen, probably derives from an ancient agricultural cycle. In Classic Maya times it operated in continuous fashion without regard to the vague year. For its history and theories of its origin, see Aveni (2001:139-140). 18. As noted in the previous discussions, Landa (Tozzer 1941:178) mentions that the Castillo has ninety-one steps per side, indicating that this was noteworthy even in the sixteenth century. (Adding one to the count, for the building platform on top, would bring the total to 365.) 19. See the Appendix to Aveni 1980, which lists the alignments.</page><page sequence="8">130 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Table 1.

All measurements are tabulated in table 3. One of the authors (Aveni) has elsewhere discussed the importance of the solar zenith passage in Maya and Mesoamerican calendrics and another (Milbrath) has presented arguments regarding its presence in orientations involving the Castillo and other structures at Chich?n Itz? (Aveni et al. 1975:977; Aveni 2001:40-46; Milbrath 1999:66-68). The NE to SW diagonal of the Castillo is skewed by 1 degree, 19 minutes from the June solstice sunrise-December sunset line; however, this skew may have been intentional in order that the geometry of the pyramid might permit the revelation of yet another astronomical phenomenon. The Castillo of Chich?n is widely renowned in modern popular culture for the so-called serpent hierophany,20 evident in a play of light and shadow visible on the northern stairway on the equinoxes (fig. 1 a) and about a week on either side of those dates. Late on the afternoon of March 21, crowds numbering upwards of 50,000 assemble in the plaza to witness the shadow cast by the stepped northwest corner of the pyramid on the northwest balustrade of the stairway.21 The half-diamond pattern of shadow and light that results resembles the triangular pattern on the skin of the diamondback rattlesnake.22 Whether the pattern was part of the design of the building, even whether it was actually observed by the ancient Maya remains conjectural.23 Nevertheless, the case is strengthened by a similar phenomenon at Mayap?n. The plan of the Castillo of Mayap?n (shown in the site plan in fig. 6) reveals unmistakable parallels with its prototype to the east (table 1 enumerates some of them). While the former structure is noticeably smaller, it also consists of nine layers. The erosion of most of its surfacing makes it impossible to know whether it too possessed recessed panels, but the superstructure of the building is virtually identical to its counterpart at Chich?n Itz? (cf. fig. 1 plan). However, two major differences between the buildings may represent deliberate Mayap?n variations on cosmic themes. First, the total number of steps on the Mayap?n structure is closer to 260,24 the number of days in the tzolkin, rather than the 365-day counterpart in the calendar round. Second, our measurements, taken with surveyor's transit and astronomical fix in January 2001, reveal that the 20. Aveni (2002, ch. 4; Aveni 2001:298-301) describes and discusses the phenomenon in detail, including the invention (or reinvention?) of a modern mythology surrounding it. See also the description of Krupp (1982). For an anthropological study of the impact on the local indigenous community of the modern pilgrimage to the Castillo on the spring equinox, see Casta?eda (1996). The term hierophany is defined (Eliade 1957:11) as "a revelation of the sacred in an object or event of the otherwise profane world/' 21. The celebratory date, which has lately evolved into a patriotic holiday, is now fixed officially on the birthday of heroic president Benito Juarez, regardless of whether the equinox occurs on the 20th or the 21st in a given year. The Diario de Yucat?n, Merida's (the capital city's) daily newspaper reported an attendance of 60,000 on March 2002 at Chich?n (March 22, 2002, Imagen de la Cultura y la Sociedad section, p. 1 ). 22. Crotalus durissus durissus is the most common of the Yucatecan species. 23. For a full account of the history of the phenomenon, which is documentable only back to the 1920s at best, see Carlson (1999). 24. We tallied a mean of 65.5 steps on three reconstructed stairways. The four-part division of the 260-day calendar is common in Postclassic codices, believed to be contemporary with the span of occupation at Mayap?n (fig. 12).</page><page sequence="9">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 131 Figure 6. Site plan of Mayap?n showing significant alignments. The setting sun seems to descend the northern stairway of the Castillo as viewed from the western doorway of the Round Temple between the spring equinox (alignment 4) and 30 April (alignment 1), marking a forty-day period that coincides with the burn period prior to planting. The April date also refers to a Mesoamerican pattern of solar alignments that divides the year into 260- and 105-day intervals, pairing sunset positions in April and August. Also, note the counterclockwise skew of the Round Temple's western doorway (Cf. fig. 2b). INAH site plan drawn by Pedro Delgado Ku. orientation of the base platform upon which the tower is positioned is slightly askew of cardinal (cf. table 3), thus corresponding more closely to the equinoctial rather than the zenith sunrise-sunset directions. A diagonal across the base yields a bearing of 325 degrees, which is sufficient to produce a similar hierophany upon the building, also on the northwest balustrade. This event, however, takes place on and about the December solstice (cf. fig. 3) rather than at the equinoxes.25 As is the case at Chich?n Itz?, the phenomenon is clearly visible from the northwest side of the plaza, and at Mayap?n there are a number of small platforms and a colonnade to the northwest of the pyramid that could have served as observation points (fig. 6). We believe the shift in emphasis to the solstice date may reflect changes in the calendar between the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods. Landa describes a "new fire" ceremony held in honor of Kukulcan at his temple in the town of Man? in which celebrants "placed 25. The phenomenon actually can be witnessed about a month either side of the winter solstice because the sun moves relatively slowly along the horizon at this time. See Arochi (1991) for a photo of the phenomenon taken before reconstruction. Peraza's photo is published here for the first time. Also see Newsome (1999:15).</page><page sequence="10">132 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 7. Chac masks on the northeast side of the Nunnery at Chich?n Itz? showing Venus glyphs under the eyes. Photo by Anthony F. Aveni. the banners on top of the temple. . . . They said . . . that Kukulcan came down from heaven on the last day . . ." (Tozzer 1941:158). The festival began on the sixteenth day of the month of Xul, which coincided with the winter solstice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Mayap?n's Castillo was probably constructed in the fourteenth century (Milbrath and Peraza, 2003:23). The festival calendar described by Landa applies to the period around the conquest of Yucat?n (ca. 1540) and the date of ceremonies in that calendar would presumably shift in relation to the solar events as one moves back through time, if there were no adjustment to the Postclassic Yucatec festival calendar. This issue is by no means resolved, as it may be possible that the calendar was adjusted in a similar fashion to the Postclassic Aztec festival calendar (Milbrath 1999:6, 61-62). The Round Temple of Mayap?n compared with the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? The hypothesis that the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? may have been especially designed for making astronomical observations has developed along at least four different lines of evidence, some of it circumstantial, and not all of it of equal significance. To summarize them: 1. The round shape of the building resembles that of a modern observatory. 2. Narrow horizontal shafts ("windows") emanate from the chamber in the uppermost portion of the tower; these could have been used for sighting objects on or near the horizon. 3. A number of architectural asymmetries are present in the general plan of the building. Since the featureless horizon of northern Yucat?n offers no possibilities for marking astronomical events along the horizon, such asymmetries may have been deliberately constructed to serve the practical function of incorporating significant astronomical alignments into the architecture. 4. An empirical basis must underlie the advanced calendar of the Maya; i.e. astronomers must have possessed some technique for marking and measuring astronomical intervals. In the absence of astronomical instruments of any conceivable kind in the archaeological record, the architecture offers a logical possibility.</page><page sequence="11">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 133 Figure 8. Ground-level view of alignments 4 and 1 (arrows, respectively) from the Caracol to the Castillo of Mayap?n mark the course of the setting sun during the burn period, (cf. fig. 6.) Photo by Anthony F. Aveni. While the first point may seem to be the least rational, oddly enough it appears to have been the original reason for calling the Caracol an observatory. Round buildings are unusual in the Maya area, especially those with windows. It was the second point that attracted investigators to undertake studies of astronomical alignments in the windows of the Caracol tower. Our 1975 study, which combined our own measurements on the building and a historical and archaeological survey of the building periods associated with the Caracol, was guided principally by the third and fourth points. We were encouraged that the building embodied significant astronomical alignments related to keeping the calendar when we discovered that a number of important celestial events known to be depicted in the Maya-written calendrical record could be tied specifically to building alignments. Observations of the planet Venus setting at its northern and southern extremes marked through the windows and in the base of the building can be used to determine with great accuracy the 584-day "Venus year" and the eight-year cycle tabulated on pages 24 and 46-50 in the Dresden Codex, one of the few surviving pre-Columbian Maya hieroglyphic documents. Moreover, the Dresden table incorporates dates that span many centuries, overlapping with the period in which the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? was constructed; therefore the building could have been the very astronomical "instrument" (or one of them) used to derive the empirical data which appears in the so-called Venus Table in the Dresden Codex.26 The intense focus on Venus at Chich?n was further corroborated by the existence of a series of rain deity masks containing the same Venus hieroglyphs that appear on the Dresden Venus pages, sculpted on the northeastern fa?ade of the Nunnery facing the Caracol (fig. 7). Finally, Mesoamerican worship of Quetzalcoatl (Kukulcan), long regarded to have been manifested in the form of the planet Venus, is known historically to have been associated with round buildings.27 26. A full discussion of the empirical astronomy evident in this portion of the codex can be found in Aveni (2001:184?196) and Milbrath (1999:163-174). The table itself incorporates calendar round dates that run from a.d. 623-1324. 27.

The dates for Window 1 (April 30 and August 13) span the approximate time from the planting season to the first harvest of green corn (Perez 1942), but they also divide the year into a pair of intervals close to 260 and 105 days, which may have been related to the commensuration of the tzolkin and the vague year. Interestingly, the Pleiades, long known as a star group of major importance in Maya astronomy (Aveni et al. 1975:984, fig. 10) underwent heliacal setting (last annual evening disappearance in the west) in the right hand corner of Window 1 of the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? on April 30. Therefore, its annual departure from the sky could have served the practical function, as part of a stellar/solar timing device, to anticipate the demarcation of the planting season. The Caracol of Chich?n Itz? emerges as a virtual compendium of horizon-directed alignments relating to documentable calendrical dates of considerable importance derived from independent sources. Many of the peculiar characteristics of the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? appear to be duplicated in the Round Temple of Mayap?n. Its principal (west) doorway is similarly skewed in a counterclockwise direction from the facing direction of the stairway (table 2 lists salient comparative features). The single platform of Q152 also faces northwest, toward azimuth 286? 02', the base perpendicular being significantly deviated out of line with respect to nearby structures Q162 and Q81 (see fig. 6). This base alignment targets sunsets on the date pair April 30, August 13; Mayap?n builders virtually duplicated the dates implied in the orientation of the axis of Window 1 in the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? (cf. table 3, notes for alignment 1). Moreover, it is worth noting that the solar dates associated with this orientation are identical to those that fit the skewed Teotihuacan East-West orientation (Sprajc 2001:405), thus possibly reflecting the continuation of a very early Mesoamerican tradition. A profound difference in the scale of ceremonial precincts in the two cities is evident in the close proximity of the Round Temple and Castillo at Mayap?n (40 m) as opposed to that at Chich?n Itz? (400 m). Identical alignments of the north (principal) stairway of Mayapan's Castillo and the north doorway of its Round Temple (cf. fig 6, alignments 5N and 2N and the same in table 3), together with the fact that the base perpendicular of the Round Temple cuts across the northeast corner of the Castillo, hint at a deliberate arrangement of the two buildings that may reflect astronomical alignments. The view from the center of the west doorway of the Round Temple over the top of the Castillo supports this hypothesis (fig. 8). This alignment marks the point of disappearance of the sun over the center point of the Castillo at the equinox (cf. table 3 and fig. 6, alignment 4). Solar alignments directed over the top of a tall Mesoamerican building find a parallel in the case of the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish chronicler Toribio Motolinia writes that because the great Aztec twin temple was misaligned to the equinox, King Moctezuma needed to to Quetzalcoatl (Pollock 1936; Tozzer 1941:25, note 134); however, no documentable historical source that we know of connects the worship of Venus specifically with round towers.</page><page sequence="14">Table 3.

At Mayap?n, the observer standing in the Round Temple's main doorway would note the equinox date marked by the sun setting over the center of the Castillo's temple. Two recently acquired lines of evidence support the likelihood that the two alignments noted above (both of which are framed approximately by the view shown in fig. 8) were intended to mark the limits of the sun's movement over a 40-day period (two Maya months) beginning at the spring equinox and ending on April 30, the day that divides the year into 260- and 105-day intervals.29 First, these dates relate to the Madrid Codex, a pre-Columbian Maya document from the region of northern Yucat?n that is contemporary with Mayap?n's occupation (Thompson 1972:16; Paxton 2001:31). A series of twenty-one almanacs have recently been analyzed by Hernandez and Bricker (in press). These almanacs have seasonal commencement dates corresponding to the spring equinox. A sampling of the almanacs, reproduced in figure 9, show images of the rain god holding a planting stick and scattering seeds and of the young maize god accepting dedicatory offerings. Hernandez and Bricker argue that these pages, which they date to the fifteenth century, depict rituals pertaining to planting in anticipation of the rainy season. Their work points to an intense interest on the part of farmers advised by the Madrid Codex in solar-timed rituals at a most crucial point at the end of the dry season, when the rains are just about to begin. As figure 10 shows, rains increase dramatically during May in west Yucat?n. While April averages less than 30 mm of rainfall, May totals exceed 80 mm, and the rainiest month is September, when the totals reach 160 mm. The month of March marks the lowest depth of the seasonal rainfall chart.30 The spring equinox ceremonies in the Madrid Codex and the equinox alignment of the sun setting over the Castillo as viewed from the Round Temple both point to a period well before the onset of the rains in May. The forty-day period measured by the AVERAGE RAINFALL 5 7 9 MONTH Figure 10. Seasonal rainfall distribution for Merida demonstrates the best time to conduct ceremonies in anticipation of the start of the rainy season. Source: www.wtgonline.com/data/mex/ mex500.asp. sun's movement along the horizon and marked in the two architectural alignments running from the Round Temple to the Castillo may signal the period of the burn in preparation for planting (fig. 6, alignments 1, 4). Following ancient traditions, the Yucatec Maya today prepare for planting by burning the fields during the month of March, continuing the burn until the onset of heavy rains in late May or early June (Milbrath 1999:13; Perez 1942). A second line of evidence that the solar cult was enhanced at Mayap?n emerges in the recently excavated murals of Q161, a building attached to the east side of the Castillo. Multiple images of the sun disk appear on the north and south sides of this structure (fig. 11). Each scene has a blue background framed by a border of yellow and red. The sun disks each have a standard bearer on either side holding banner staffs with squared tips that seem to penetrate the yellow solar corona. The sun disks have four red rays arranged around the yellow corona and a blue center. The standard bearers and the solar disks are essentially the same in all surviving scenes, but the diving deities positioned in the center of the solar disks all seem to be different (Peraza et al. 1996: Figs. 1 7 and 18, 2001 : plates 16 and 1 7). On the south side, one sun deity has a red body and yellow chin (fig. 11 b), while the next sun figure to the right has white body spots with red markings (pustules?). There are a total of three sun disks with a solar deity flanked by standard bearers. Mural fragments showing the headdress of a fourth standard bearer and part of the 28. See Aveni et al. (1988) for full citations and a discussion of this interesting case and its relation to Aztec creation mythology. 29. Interestingly, among the host of alignments at Chich?n Itz?'s Caracol, both the equinoctial and the April 30/August 13 alignments show up in Window 1 (Aveni et al. 1975:table 1). They seem to acquire some greater prominence, however, at Mayap?n. 30. Source: www.wtgonline.com/data/mex/mex500.asp.</page><page sequence="16">138 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 11a. Mayap?n.

The surviving murals indicate that there were a total of eight rectangular panels and eight sun disks, each with two standard bearers and a sun disk in the center. The actual number of sun disks may have significance in terms of eight calendar divisions associated with cardinal and intercardinal directions, recalling the layout of the calendar in the Madrid Codex (fig. 12; P?xton 2001). The equinoxes and solstices form natural divisions that partition the annual cycle into quarters. If the spring equinox initiates a forty day period at the end of the dry season, a look at the seasonal rainfall totals suggest the winter solstice could serve as a convenient indicator of a forty-day period at the beginning of the dry season.</page><page sequence="17">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 139 Figure 12. The 260-day calendar on Madrid Codex pages 75-76 is divided into eight parts forming a cosmogram of the cardinal and intercardinal directions. This format also reflects the division of the solar year into four quarters by the equinoxes and solstices, a concept possibly encoded in radial pyramids such as the two Castillos. The footprints on the Madrid diagram of figure 12 mark twenty-day periods of the year or Haab, and a pair would represent forty days, a period preserved today among the Maya who call the interval of forty days the "feet of the year" (Milbrath 1999:60, 71). As seen in figure 10, the forty-day period before the winter solstice is marked by an abrupt decline in rain. Indeed, Bricker (1997) has argued that the spring equinox and the winter solstice both served as quarter-year markers in seasonal Haab almanacs found in the Madrid Codex. Therefore the appearance of the sun over the top of the Castillo on the equinox at Mayap?n and the winter solstice serpent hierophany may have constituted visible signals for the rituals, depicted pictorially in the codices, that took place at the beginning and end of the planting cycle. Finally, there is additional evidence that the alignments offer a solstitial link between the Round Temple and Castillo of Mayap?n. In stark contrast to its counterpart at Chich?n Itz?, the central cylindrical structure of Q152 at Mayap?n is solid throughout. Four small niches, each approximately 120 cm high, just large enough to accommodate a seated person (they are discernible in the plan of fig. 6), replace the four inner doorways. An observer seated within each of them would have had access to the skyline via a narrow slit framed by the</page><page sequence="18">140 RES 45 SPRING 2004 outer doorways located 45 degrees to either side. A similar configuration exists in the Caracol of Chich?n Itz?, but instead of the niches, the observation points are the inner doorways, which have similar diagonal views through the exterior doorways. The significance of these angles as possible sighting points has become apparent only in light of their repetition in the architecture of Mayap?n's Round Temple. As can be seen in table 3, the directions of these alignments are close matches to the diagonals taken from the center points of each of the inner doorways through the outer doorways of the Caracol of Chich?n Itz?. Of the eight possible alignments we measured through these openings at Mayap?n, two of them (table 3 and fig. 6, alignments 3c, 3g) accurately mark the solstices. The winter solstice, it should be noted, corresponds to the central date of the hierophany on the northwest stairway of Q162 and this solstice alignment also comes close to cutting across the southeast edge of the Castillo. As at Chich?n Itz?, then, there is evidence that astronomical observations taken from the Round Temple of Mayap?n may have been used to formalize the December solstice hierophany at Mayap?n's Castillo by marking the date with greater precision. Though we cannot verify it photographically due to the intrusion of an elevated tree line in the modern landscape, as well as the fact that the southeast corner cannot be fully reconstructed, our calculations suggest that a hierophany similar to that which took place on the west side of the northern stairway at sunset would have occurred six months later over the east side of the southern stairway of Q162 on the morning of the June solstice. Conclusions: Imitation vs. innovation All over the world people who respect and revere their perceived past seek to replicate to one degree or another its material qualities. As Umberger (1987:62) has argued, "the veneration and reuse of ancient cities, collection of ancient objects and the creation of archaizing copies" were ubiquitous in the Aztec world.31 She believes that the Pan-Mesoamerican concept of time and history as cyclic would tend to promote revivalism as a way of setting up a dialectic between past and present. The habit of reoccupying ancient sites in the Late Classic period is well documented (ibid: 64-65), and during the Postclassic Chich?n continued to have considerable influence in the traditions and identity of Mayap?n.32 Chich?n's legacy at Mayap?n seems to have taken the form of replication of components of an entire city. Mayap?n was well situated to become a replica of Chich?n Itz? in a calendrical sense. There is even some evidence that its geographic location may have been predetermined from considerations based on positional astronomy. Mayap?n lies within 11 km (6.2 arc minutes) of the latitude of Chich?n Itz?. Therefore all astronomical events that take place on the solar zenith passage dates at the two sites are identical. This means that any calendar based on direct observation of the sun overhead or on the horizon would have been essentially the same.33 Why are the Venus alignments that are so prominent in the Caracol of Chich?n Itz? totally absent in Q152 at Mayap?n?34 There is good epigraphic evidence that the Venus cult expressed in the Classic period inscriptions on the monuments and further perpetuated in Terminal Classic architecture in north Yucat?n had largely faded away by the time of Mayap?n's Postclassic florescence.35 Lounsbury has argued that minuscule corrections to the Venus Table in the Dresden Codex designed to bring the ephemeris into exact chronological concurrence with astronomical reality had clearly been abandoned by the 31. Umberger (1987:61) cites examples of important studies of archaizing in Andean civilization, noting the scant references to the subject of Mesoamerican antiquarianism. 32. The link between Chich?n and Mayap?n is discussed extensively in Milbrath and Peraza (2003). 33. Mayap?n's latitude is 20?37.8/ N, while that of Chich?n Itz? is 20?44.0/ N. Within the limit of detectability the zenith sun rise/set dates (May 24, July 19 [see p. 129]) are identical. The corresponding rise/set azimuths differ by 6 arc minutes or one fifth of the width of the sun's disk. This is also the case for a third large round tower at Paalmul (Paamul) on the east coast of Yucat?n on which we reported prior to its destruction by a hurricane (Aveni and H?rtung 1978). 34. Another related aspect of Venus at Chich?n Itz? also lost at Mayap?n is the connection of the Castillo with a Venus platform complex (see Carlson 1999:144-145), an architectural unit repeated in the Osario complex. The Castillo complex consists of a large radial temple-pyramid, a radial Venus platform containing iconography showing the symbolic binding of eight-year bundles tied to Venus symbols carved in relief on its wall panels, and a sacbe (ceremonial white roadway) leading to a cenote, or natural well, all three arranged along a more or less straight axis. 35. Ruiz Gallut et al. (2001) propose a rather convoluted sighting scheme that involves Venus and which in our view seems highly unlikely. It involves observations taken over the Round Temple from the base of the Q161 wall that contains the mural paintings and the determination of dates when the paintings would have been directly illuminated by the sun. They use the intervals between these dates to derive numerical ratios that correspond to commensuration with the Venus synodic cycle. This leads to charting the movement of Venus, the Milky Way and other night-sky objects over the same building from the same perspective in the late thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="19">Aveni, Milbrath, and Peraza Lope: Chich?n Itz?'s legacy 141 time Mayap?n came to power (Lounsbury 1983). The declining interest in Venus events at Mayap?n was accompanied by the disappearance of the Long Count calendar in any form of notation. Although Tun-Ahau inscriptions continued to be used in Postclassic times, the last documented Long Count inscription, dated to A.D. 1210, appears in the Dresden Codex. The Dresden Codex also records the last known Venus almanac, probably also dating to the thirteenth century.36 At this time, however, written calendars seem to emphasize a clear shift of interest to the cycle of the katuns and the tzolkin, the only two calendar cycles recorded at Mayap?n (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:38). While the change may be regarded by some as a calendric devolution, we would prefer to think of it as a shift of emphasis in the celestially determined program that makes up the calendar. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all in the present investigation is the clever twist Mayap?n architects? long regarded as inattentive and relatively unskilled by Mayanists such as Thompson and Proskouriakoff37? incorporated in their site planning and building orientations. They developed into ardent sun watchers as suggested by one of the few surviving written documents of that period, the Madrid Codex. Thus, they established sun-timed rituals in the heat of the dry season, when due attention could be paid to the solar ancestor deity from whom they anticipated a bountiful crop yield. Replication in astronomical architecture has an earlier precedent in the Maya world. The Group E-type structures, after the prototype at Uaxact?n, functioned from the Late Preclassic through the Early Classic period (400 B.c. to a.D. 600) at sites in the southern lowlands as observatories to mark the equinoxes and solstices. Evidently affected by calendrical reform indicating a shift of interest in how seasonal time should be kept, later versions of these architectural complexes evolved into devices for marking dates in the seasonal year reckoned in multiples of twenty days before the first annual solar zenith passage (Aveni et al. 2003). Given the similarities between the general layout and the specific alignments incorporated in Terminal Classic Chich?n Itz?'s and Postclassic Mayap?n's two most famous buildings, we can only marvel at both the continuity of the importance of sky-based ritual in the calendar and the novel aspects of this specialized architecture at Mayap?n. Mayap?n may carry the stigma, long perpetuated in the literature, of a place devoid of anything either sculpturally or architecturally worth extolling, but as recent excavations suggest (Milbrath and Peraza 2003; Peraza 1999), and this study corroborates, the Postclassic Maya who built the city succeeded in enhancing the scientific calendrical achievements of an ancient culture they appear to have clearly respected. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but if innovation follows from it, there may be reflected a measure of creativity and independence. 36. Although Lounsbury (1983) proposed that the Venus calendar in the Dresden Codex dates to the tenth century, we favor a somewhat later date, following Thompson (1972:15) and Milbrath (1999:172-173). It may be that vestiges of the archaic Venus cycle were linked with the solar cycle at Mayap?n, following an earlier tradition seen at Teotihuacan and Chich?n Itz?. The eight Mayap?n sun disks may have been intended to symbolize the commensuration of five Venus cycles with eight years depicted in the Venus almanac (5 x 584 = 8 x 365 days); see Milbrath (1999:183). Regarding Teotihuacan, Carlson (1993) proposes that Teotihuacan developed an eight-year Venus almanac, encoding the equation of five Venus cycles with eight solar years. The symbols painted in this Venus almanac may be seen in the trapeze and-ray year sign associated with Tlaloc imagery (spread with Tlaloc imagery to the Maya world). Lacking Long Count inscriptions, the people of Mayap?n used the Venus almanac introduced by people from Chich?n Itz?. In Yucat?n, the earliest clear evidence of this system seems to date to the ninth century at Chich?n Itz? and Uxmal. One panel of Chich?n's Venus platform shows inscriptions of a Maya bar equaling five tied to a Venus glyph and then eight dots indicating the number eight in Mexican style linked with a Mexican year sign atop a year bundle, signifying the equation of eight solar years and five Venus cycles. If the Venus cycle was encoded in the Calendar Round and eight-year almanac, it was not necessary to use the Long Count or architectural orientations to track the Venus cycle. Indeed, Teotihuacan lacks apparent Venus alignments. See also Milbrath 1999:186-187. 37. A member of the Carnegie team, T. Proskouriakoff (1955:96, 100) described Mayap?n as characterized by "shoddy construction" and "workmanship hardly worth a passing glance," exemplifying the "tragic cultural decline."
