<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAIN SYMBOLISM IN PAGAN CELTIC RELIGION BY ANNE ROSS IN recent years the researches of certain French and Belgian scholars have fo- cused attention upon groups of Gallo-Roman and Celtic religious monuments. Their work in general has consisted of analyses of individual monuments from the point of view of art forms, i.e., an attempted determination of what is native as opposed to what is classical in style and influence; over and above this, efforts have been made at an interpretation of the symbolism of the native material. These interpretations have been essayed largely by comparing a particular monument or cult object with similar related monuments, using epigraphical evidence and such classical references as would seem to assist in casting light on the religious organization and practices of the Celts. Sufficient sound research has been conducted in this field to allow certain general conclusions to be reached. These indicate that god-types, as opposed to individual universal Gaulish deities, are to be looked for as an important feature of the religion of the Gauls, and the evidence of epigraphy strongly supports this conclusion.' Nothing comparable to the official state religion of the Romans is indicated by the monumental evidence, and the great number of god-types is further attested by the variety of indige- nous god representations or names which have been assimilated to one classical type such as Mercury or Mars. The problem of Celtic religion in Europe may thus be said to be mainly archaeological, the great corpus of stone monuments, bronzes, coins and ceramics making a reasonable interpretation and understand- ing of the religious idiom of the continental Celts possible. In considering the evidence for pagan Celtic religion in Britain and in Ireland, however, the problem is different and to some extent more complex. There is a comparative paucity of material evidence for the religion of the British and the early Irish, but such as there is does dovetail with the continental evidence. There are omissions which must be accounted for, and there are motifs peculiar to the Irish tradition, but in general the evidence points to a similarity of religious out- look and practice. The Romano-British remains have been well documented, the native British religious monuments rather less so; in actual fact the corpus of British material is considerably larger than is perhaps generally realized, but even allowing for this, it is negligible in comparision with the Gaulish material evidence. It is sufficient, however, to show that certain cults which flourished in Gaul, even during the period of Celtic independence, also existed in Britain; for example, the cult of a Celtic deity sometimes assimilated to Mars, with the ser- pent (frequently ram-headed) attribute, the mother goddesses, gods represented 1 I refer to such publications as Marie-Louise Sjoestedt, Gods and Heroes of the Celt8, translated by M. Dillon (London, 1949); Pierre Lambrechts, Contributions a l'etude des divinit6s celtiques (Bruges, 19492): L'Exaltation de la tOte dans la pense et dans l'art des Celtes (Bruges, 1954); Emile Thevenot, "Le Monument de Mavilly," Latomus, xiv (1955), 75 ff.; Sur les Traces des Mars celtiques (Bruges, 1955); Raymond Lantier, "La Religion celtique," L'Histoire ginrale des religions, edd.

In Ireland the material evidence is even less satisfactory, being limited to such objects as two or three heads in stone, two or three-faced, after the manner of the Gaulish and British tradition, one or two weapons with representations of gods on them which are reminiscent of, for example, some of the figures on the Gunde- strup cauldron, and some cult objects having birds in the round set on themn, and seemingly foi-ming a link with the Hallstatt tradition of Europe. It must be borne in mind, however, that archaeological research has not yet been fully developed in Ireland and future excavations might serve to augment the e-isting nmaterial evidence. Using the material evidence alone, then, and the evidence of epigraphy and place names, it is only possible to get a very summary idea of the native religious idiom of the British Isles. Some references by Caesar to the druidic organization in Britain, as well as to the fact that the goose, hare, and domestic fowl were not eaten by the British, help to supplement the actual monumental evid.ence for Britain, but there is nothing comparable for Ireland, and the fact that the Ro- mans did not occupy that country makes the evidence there at once more pro- vocative, and problematic. The material evidence for Britain and Ireland, such as it is, used in conjunc- tion with the magnificent corpus of European evidence, is sufficient to indicate conclusively that, in spite of certain inexplicable, or seemingly inexplicable dif- ferences and apparen-t gaps, there is a close enough affinity among the three groups to make it legitimate for us to speak of a distinctive Celtic religion. Over ancl above this concrete evidence, however, there is a considerable cor- pus of early Irish and (to a lesser extent) XYelsh literary texts, the examination of wllich, in tPe light of the material reinains, must certainly be undertaken. Any- one embarking upon such a study must be fully aware of the great problems such material contains. It is no easy task to disentangle what is clearly religious from the motifs and fancies of storytellers, and of course to separate what is pagan froii what is Christian. A very careful and sober scrutiny of any textual material is, therefore, essential if it is to be in any way considered as documenting re- ligious beliefs. It is all too easy to recognize deities in every Irish culture hero and folk-figure, and traces of religious practice in every festive gathering and activity of the literary and legendary figures. The inventive and imaginative powers, and the sense of hunmor of the Celtic scribes and storytellers must never be under- estimated. Moreover, it is natural to expect that the early Irish church, in gen- eral sympathetic to the native tradition, would suppress or modify anything in it which savored too obviously of pagan belief. However, in view of the richness and complexity of the religious traditions among the Celts as evidenced by ar- chaeology, and the astonishing fidelity and persistence of oral transmission, even 2 The importance of the head in early Celtic religion has been emphasized by Pierre Lambrechts, op. cit. Whether there was an indigenous cult of matres of the Gaulish and Germanic type is open to question, but there is adequate evidence for groups of goddesses of closely related type, of which the Irish trio of war/fertility goddesses perhaps furnishes the best example.</page><page sequence="3">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 41 in the present century, it is not unreasonable to expect that, at the earliest period of Irish manuscript activity, legends and traditions and even surreptitious be- liefs would still be very much in evidence, even in an Ireland which had nomi- nally accepted Christianity for some centuries. For this reason, it is clear that the literary material must be used and used intensively if any serious re-examination andl re-assessment of the early religion of the Celts is to be made.' The evidence of archaeology makes it clear that, in the religion of the Celts, in common with the religions of many other peoples, certain individual gods or god-types were especially associated with particular birds or animals. This oc- curs to such an extent that one may quite justifiably speak in terms of a serpent god, a raven god, a horse or sheep goddess, etc., meaning that these gods and god- desses are symbolized by and frequently accompanied by such birds or animals. Insular texts also indicate that such deities were known in Britain and Ireland, for example, the Irish war goddesses, triple in number, having crow/raven attributes and transformations; Riannon, the Welsh equivalent of Epona the Gaulish horse goddess; and groups of horned/antlered gods of the Cernunnos type. In the following investigation into the possible significance of the chain in early Celtic religion, where the Irish evidence is of major importance, we are mainly concerned with a group of beings who cannot in themselves be regarded as bird go(s, but who assume the form of swans or other aquatic birds, and are recogniza- ble in this form by chains or necklets of gold and silver about their throats. These two motifs, i.e., the transformation of superhuman beings into swans, and the wearing of chains, or linking together by chains of the metamorphosed be- ings, are thought-provoking. They are not paralleled elsewhere in the Irish tra- dition.4 The Gallo -Roman and British religious monuments reveal a singular lack of swan and duck imagery although marsh birds, such as the crane, are fairly well represented.' The chain itself figures symbolically on some Gaulish coins,6 3 It is perhaps necessary, in any mention of the use of literary tradition as a source for religious motifs, to draw attexntion to the approach of one scholar, whose methods and conclusions would, if accepted, virtually rule out any use of the early Irish texts as source material for such a study. I refer to James Carney's Studies in Irish Literature and History (Dublin, 1955), and more particularly to his paper "The Ecclesiastic Background to Irish Saga," in Arctica: Essays presented to Ake Campbell (1956), pp. 221-2927. Here he seeks an ecclesiastic origin and background for the earliest stratum of Irisli secular literature. He claims literary authorship of a post-Christian date for the early texts. It must be stressed that it would be unrealistic to deny that ecclesiastic elements have become incor- porated with the native material, as it is clear that the reverse process has also operated, i.e., that sainits and ecclesiastics have taken over the attributes of local deities and supernatural beings. Exist- ing native traditions and the evidence of archaeology must be exhaustively studied in order to estimate precisely how much has been borrowed into Irish literary traditions from non-native sources. 4 For supernatural chained hounds see p. 53 infra, note 45; for chained heifers, p. 54. 6 Non-classical representations of swans do occur, e.g., on a monument from Dijon (see E. Espe randieu, Recueil genural des bas-reliefs statues et bustes de la Gaule Romaine, I-X, Plate 3530), where the bird is in an attitude of aggression; it holds a branch in its beak. It figures again on an altar from Muddersheim (Esp&amp;randieu, plate 6567), inscribed "Matronia Arvagastis." Three mother goddesses holding fruit arc represented; beside a swan is a cornucopia filled with pine cones, apples, pears, etc. A most interesting statuette representing Sequana, goddess of the Seine, comes from the site of a temple on the Seine. The goddess is depicted standing in a bark made up of the body of a large duck which holds a berry or votive cake in its beak. (Lantier/Esp6randieu, XI, Plate 7676). This may be</page><page sequence="4">42 Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion and the torque clearly held some magic, divine significance.7 There is, however, a vast corpus of cult objects dating in the main from the early Iron Age, proto- Celtic and Celtic, some of which parallel visually the striking verbal imagery of the early Irish texts. Here we have a great wealth of swan and duck symbolism, in connection with cult objects of many kinds, and it is clear that these birds played an important role in the religious practices with which they were asso- ciated. Moreover, complex chains and necklets occur in great profusion. From the point of view of the Irish material, however, the most significant fact is that here also swans with chains about their necks are represented. At this period, such complex objects had a clear religious association; in the Irish textual material the descriptions constitute a wonder motif, but one which seems to echo an earlier belief, and the similarity of these two motifs, visual and verbal is striking. It is proposed to examine the relevant Irish texts in some detail, and then to con- sider some of the more important cult objects in order to compare and contrast the two traditions. The motif of the wonderful chain-bearing birds figures most prominently and is described in the greatest detail in the early Irish story of the dream of Angus.8 Angus, son of the Dagda, has fallen in love with a girl who has visited him in his sleep, and his longing for her has made him ill. Eventually it is discovered that the girl is the daughter of Ethal Anbuail from Sid Uamain in Connacht. Bodb of compared with the little duck from Milber Down, Devon, which has a cake in its beak, and probably dates from the first century B.C. Another duck representation comes from the Romano-British village of Rotherley; it is bronze and has a human head on its back. The top opens from the tail and exposes a cavity. The eyes of both bird and man are hollow for settings of glass or some other sub- stance. There is also a series of little bronze ducks and swans in Reading Museum, from the Silchester Collection, not at present on view. Apart from these monuments and objects in the round, there is little else of interest from Gaul or Britain. 6 A Gaulish coin depicts a man-headed horse, accompanied by a bird, and below this, a bull. A chain, joined as a necklace, has a cross suspended from it; see J. A. MacCulloch, "Celtic Mythology," in Mythology of All Races, iII (Boston, 1930), Plate ii2. Another coin, the imagery of which is of im- portance here, comes from the region of the Loire, and belongs to the Cenomani, dating from the third or second century B.C. On one side is a central head, placed on some sort of support, surrounded by four heads, joined together by chains. On the reverse side, a winged being crouches beneath a man-headed horse. See A. Blanchet, Manuel de numismatiquefranQaise (Paris, 1912), i, Fig. 40, p. 34. Another stater has a head surmounted by a boar, the whole encircled by a chain. On the reverse side is a huge wheel beneath a human-headed horse (Blanchet, Fig. 44, p. 35). These examples of coin motifs, which are by no means exhaustive, show imagery which is directly relevant to the study of chain symbolism. 7 The torque appears frequently on Gallo-Roman monuments depicting native Gaulish deities. Its importance is emphasized by the fact that it appears alone or with symbolic objects on several Gaulish altars. Sometimes the god wears a huge torque, sometimes he holds it. Fol example, an altar from Notre Dame shows the god Cernunnos with two large torques hanging from his antlers. A relief from Vendeuvres shows the stag-god again as an antlered child, holding a purse and torque, flanked by serpents. The torque also figures frequently on Gaulish coins. For a discussion of the torque as a talis- man-symbol of divinity, see F. A. Schaeffer, Les Tertres fun6raires prghistoriques dans la For9t de Haguenau" (Haguenau, 1930), ii, 214 ff. 8 Aislinge Oenguso, ed. Francis Shaw (Dublin, 1934); text preserved in Egerton 1782, fol. 70 b. The text probably goes back to the eighth century, possibly to the first half of the century.</page><page sequence="5">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 43 Sid al Femen takes Angus to Loch Bel Dracon where he has learnt the girl will be.9 They came, thereupon, so that they were at the loch. They saw one hundred and fifty full-grown girls. The girls only reached up to her shoulder. A chain of silver between every pair of girls. A necklace of silver about her own throat and a chain of refined gold.... The superior powers of Caer, Angus' choice, are here emphasized by her height, even in comparison with the other supernatural girls. Divinities and supernatural beings are usually regarded as being larger than human beings. In the descrip- tion above, she is also marked out from the others by having both a neck orna- ment of silver, and a chain of red gold. It is not stated to what this chain was at- tached. The other girls are linked together in pairs. Another account of Caer and her companions gives a more detailed and slightly variant description of her neck adornments, and helps to augment the above passage. The birdflock is described as having ... a chain of silver between each pair of birds. One bird among them, more beautiful than the birds of the world, with a neck ornament of red-gold about its throat. Three times fifty chains from it with an apple of gold on the end of every chain....11 It will be noted that the number of chains suspended from Caer's necklace corresponds to the number of girls/birds which accompany her. The possible significance of this complex neck ornament is discussed below in connection with the material objects.1" 9 Op. cit., p. 53. The Irish is as follows: To-lotar farum co mbatar oc loch. Co n-accatar inna tri coecta ingen macdacht. Con-accatar in n-ingin n-etarru. Ni tacmuictis inna hingena di acht coticci a gualainn. Slabrad airgdide eter cach di ingin. Muince airgdide imma brtgait fadisin ocus slabrad di or fhorloisethiu...... 10 The passage occurs in the Leabhar Breac p. 242. Shaw copied the description of Caer from the actual manuscript. The additional details are of great interest here. The text (op. cit., p. 19) is as fol- lows: Is amlaid imorro, bitis in enlaith sin, co slabrad argait etar cech d'a nen dib. Oen en etarru, 'aille do enaib in domain, co muince dergoir ima bragait. Tri caegait slabrad ass co nuball oir for cind cech shlabraid. The underlying idea in this description of the magic swans seems to be that of the central swan wear- ing a complex necklace, the number of chains of which are equal to the number of chain-linked swans about the central bird. These chains may have been thought of as being attached to the balls of gold, and would thus closely resemble such objects as those illustrated by Kossack in Studien zum Symbol gut der Urnenfelder und fIallstattzeit Mitteleuropas, Romisch-Germanische Forschungen, 20 (Berlin, 1954), plate 17, where birds and anthropomorphic figures and chains are built up into a fantastic com- plex whole. A most unusual bronze chain head-dress from Cavenham Heath, Suffolk, was found beside two ritual crowns probably worn by native priests, or god-images. The chain head-dress consists of five bronze discs joined together by eight metal chains formed of s-shaped links. Another chain and disc ornament, the discs decorated, and two extra chains for pendants, was found at Stony Stratford, Buckingham. Both these objects date from the early Romano-British period.

There are other instances in Celtic literary con- texts, of chains described as being attached to people or things, where the chain seems to be symbolic, not of transformation, but of the power and vigor of the being or object chained, and the necessity</page><page sequence="6">44 Chaina Symbolism in. Celtic Religion Caer's magic powers are stressed by her father when he replies to Ailill's de- mand that she should be given to Angus. Thereupon Ailill said to Ethal Anbuail "give your daughter to the Dagda's son." "I cannot," said he, "her power is greater than mine." "VWhat is the great magic she pos- sesses?" said Ailill. "That is not difficult. She is in bird form the one year, in human form the other." "Wllat is the year in which she is in bird form?" said Ailill. "It is not for me to betray her," said her father. "Off with your head," said Ailill, "unless you may tell us" ... "This coming Samhuin she will be in bird form at Loch Bel Dracon, and wonderful birds will be seen with her there, and one hundred and fifty swans will be with her; and I am making preparations for them."'2 It is apparently necessary for Angus to seek Caer during her termn in bird form, perhaps indicating that while under metamorphosis her vulnerability was in- creased. In the above passage, the marvellous birds are clearly stated to be swans, although the word is only used twice in the entire text. It is, however, possible that the term en find "white bird" was applied to the swan alone at this for restraint. Although restraint would seem to be the primary function of these chains, the fact that the beings so described are probably or certainly supernatural may have some significance. Wbhat these particular chains do not symbolize, however, is metamorphosis. One or two examples will be mentioned. In his description of the Gaulish god Ogmios, Lucian refers to him as being old and dark-complex- ioned, and as drawing along a crowd of people by slender gold chains attached to their ears from his tongue. Ogmios is the god of eloquence, and the chains symbolize his power over his devotees. Ilere, although Cgmios is a god, and the chains symbolic, they are not the insignia of transformation. In the Tdin B6 CalIgne, where the appearance of the hosts of Ulster is described in great detail, one group is led by "a black hasty swarthy man in the front rank of that band; seven chains around his neck; seven men at the end of each chain; these seven groups of men he drags along, so that their faces strike against the ground and they revile him till he desists. Another terrible man is there . . . Ercenn son of the three stewards, he it is in the chains. " Here the chains are holding back the hero, and so great is the ardor and battle fury of Ercenn that seven groups of seven men can barely restrain him (Joseph Dunn, The Ancient Iri.sh Epic Tale Tdin B6 Cilalgne [London, 1914], p. 335). A similar device is used to keep Fiacail mac Conchenn from moving too rapidly in the story of the "Boyish Exploits of Finn" (Kuno Mfeyer, Eriu, i, 180 ff.). Here "twelve balls of lead were round the neck of Fiacail, to check his vigour, such was his swiftness" (p. 189). Finallv, in the Scottish Gaelic hero ballad "A Mhuileartach Bhuidlhe" (J. F. Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands, I [Edin- burgh, 186QJ), there is a description of Fionn's standard Gile-Ghreine: "there were nine chains from it downward fell, of the yellow gold of no lustre dull, a hero at every chain of these, that was holding them against the stays" (p. 139). Here again, the chains appear to be restraining something. Weapons and standards were regarded with superstitious respect by the Celts, as were some musical instru- ments, and were sometimes believed to be capable of acting independently. The hag against whom the Fenians are going to fight is described as being "blue-black" of the lustre of coal"; the leader of the Ulster host is likewise dark-skinned, as is Ogmios, according to Lucian. This is a not uncommon feature of powerful or malevolent supernatural beings. 12 Is farum as-bert Ailill fri h-Ethal nAnbuail 'tabair do ingin do macc in Dagdai.' 'Ni cumcaim' ol se, 'is m6o a cumachtae in-d6.' 'Ced cumachtae m6r fil lee?" ol Ailill. 'Ni anse, buid i ndeilb euin cach la-bliadnai, in mbliadnai n-aili i ndeilb duini.'

The L.B. passage refers to Caer's superhuman powers in the following terms: ba hingen cumachiach ilchrothach hi ("she was a powerful, many-shaped girl"). (Shaw, p. 19).</page><page sequence="7">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 45 stage, and we find it used in the following passage where we know the birds to be swans. Angus goes in search of Caer. The Macc Oc goes until he was at Loch Bel Dracon. He saw one hundred and fifty white birds upon the loch with their silver chains with golden ringlets about their heads. Oengus was in human form upon the bank of the loch. He calls the girl to him. "Come and speak with me, Caer." "Whlo calls me?" said Caer. "Angus calls you." "I shall go there if you guarantee to me on your honour that I may go back to the loch." "I admit you [i.e., your request]," said he. She went to him. He cast his arms about her. They fall asleep in the form of two swans so that they circled the loch tllree times so that there should not be anything that should be a loss of honour to him. They set forth in the form of two white birds until they were at the palace of the Macc Oc, and they sang in musical harmony so that they caused the people to sleep for three days and three nights. The girl stayed with him after that.13 Bird metamorphosis is a striking feature of this tale, to such an extent that it is not always clear whether Caer and Angus are thought of as being in bird or in human form. WVhen Angus visits the loch, in the above passage, Caer Ibormeith is in swan form and Angus in human shape. But when Caer goes to Angus on the bank of the locl to talk with him she has presumably taken on human form again, for on Angus' casting his arms about her they both become swans, in which shape they encircle the loch before making for Angus' dwelling. It seems as though the actual physical contact causes the transformation.14 The expression con-tuilet i ndeilb da geise ("they fall asleep in the form of two swans") is problematic. It would seem to mean simply that they slept together in swan form, but there is another possibility, namely, that physical transformation was thought of as oc- curring through the medium of some sort of trance. If this can be taken to be the meaning, it would not be unparalleled.'5 Throughout this extraordinary tale, transformation is spontaneous, and no agent of metamorphosis is mentioned. To gain possession of Caer Angus does not steal her "swan cloak" and thereby render her powerless, as in the international swan maiden tale.16 He himself must take on her bird form. In this tale it seems 13 Teit in Macc Oc co mboi oc Loch Bel Dracon. Co n-accae tri coecta en find forsin loch cona slabradaib airgdidib co cairchesaib 6rdaib imma cenna.

The international type is as follows: The hero (often a hunter) sees birds, usually swans, but sometimes geese or ducks; they fly to a lake, where they set aside their feather dresses and become beautiful girls, usually of a supernatural nature. The hero steals one of the cloaks and the girl to whom it belongs is now in his power and becomes his wife. Frequently she discovers her hidden feather dress in later years and, donning it, regains her freedom.</page><page sequence="8">46 Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion clear that a phenomenon of deeper significance than that of mere arbitrary shape- shifting is implied, the young women being as often in. bird form as in human shape, and their time for each shape being closely regulated. The preparations to be made by Bodb for his daughter in bird form, and the fact that the text states that the change from human to bird form took place at Samhuin, a time of feast- ing and religious activity in the pagan Celtic world, imbues it with added impor- tance. Powerful as Caer's magic was, she appears to have been herself controlled by an even stronger force, and her insistence upon returning to the loch with Angus, or at least on making a token return, seems to imply that she was not entirely free from the power that regulated her spell in bird form on the water.'7 Chain-bearing birds figure, and play a major role in the story of the conception of Cu Chulainn. There are two versions of the legend and the following passages are taken from that contained in the Lebor nai h-Uidre.'8 Conchobor and the noblemen of Ulster were at Emain Macha. A flock of birds came to the plain of Emain. They devoured it so that they did not leave as much as roots or grass or herbs in the ground. It was an affliction to the Ulstermen to see them destroying their land. One day they yoke nine chariots to hunt them, for it was a custom of theirs to chase birds. Conchobor was there in his chariot and his daughter Deichtine, and she was grown-up. She was her father's charioteer. The birds go before them homewards across Sliabh Fuait, across Edmuinn, across Bregia. There was neither dyke nor fence nor rampart round land in Ireland at that time but level plains. Lovely and choice was that bird flock and the bird song that was with them. There were nine score birds a chain of silver between each pair of birds. Every twenty in a group apart, nine groups of them. Thus two birds that were in front of them, a yoke of silver between them. Three birds separated themselves from them until nightfall, and they went before them as far as the Brugh of the Boyne..... Later, after various adventures have befallen Deichtine and Conchobor, Lugh comes to her and tells her that he has been responsible for the bird flock which 17 Even in human form these supernatural creatures are closely associated with the water. Another instance of chain-bearing supernatural beings, associated with water, occurs in the legend of the magic vessel of Badurn ("The Irish Ordeals," Irische Texte, edd. Stokes and Windisch [Leipzig, 1891], p. 191). Badurn's wife goes to a well and sees two women there from the fairy mounds, linked to- gether by a chain of bronze. When they see the king's wife coming, they go under the well, and she follows them into the water, and at the bottom gains entrance into the fairy mound. Although the chained creatures here are described as women, it is likely that they are also capable of taking on some bird form. and the fact that they submerge, as do the chained metamorphosed birds in the Serglige Con Culainn, implies that they were connected with aquatic birds. It is of interest to note that the entrance to the Other World is here conceived of as being at the bottom of the well. The chained women here lead the king's wife to a vessel which serves as a truth test. The chained swan (p. 52 8upra) serves as a chastity test. 18 A. G.

The birds are clearly metamorphosed, as the chains indicate, Lugh himself perhaps being present in bird form.19 Supernatural chain-bearing birds occur in the story of Cu Chulainn's wasting sickness, in the following passages. The Ulstermen are gathered together to celebrate the feast of Samhuin.20 While they were there then, a bird flock alights on the loch by them. There was not a lovelier bird flock in Ireland. The women were very eager about the many birds that were upon it. Each of them began to contend with the other about the obtaining of the birds. Ethne Aitenchaithrech, Conchobor's wife said, "I should like a bird from yonder bird flock for each of my shoulders...."21 Cu Chulainn is requested to get the birds for the women and eventually he does so, and distributes them to all but his wife, who is angry. He promises her two of the most beautiful birds he can obtain. It was not long until they saw two birds upon the loch and a chain of red gold between them. They sang low music. Sleep fell upon the host. Cu Chulainn goes towards them. "If you listen to me," said Ethne, "you would not go to them, for there is some power behind these birds" . . . "I am a doomed man," says he, "since I took up arms my aim was not false until today." lIe threw his javelin at them so that it went through the wing of one of the birds thereupon. They went under the water.22 Later two women appear to him and beat him until he is unconscious. We hear no more of the birds in the tale. As the above passage indicates, the birds in the Serglige are not specified, but they are clearly aquatic, which is in keeping with the material remains discussed below; they are simply described as being beautiful. The flock which arrives in the first instance is not chain-bearing and, therefore, does not presumably represent transformed beings, but is simply com- 19 Lugh probably manifests himself as the third member of the group of three birds which separate themselves from the others, the other two presumably being chained together. In this passage Lugh uses birds as his agents in fulfilling his purpose, ie., to beget a son on Deichtine. Op. cit., p. 5: Asbertfria robad torrach gad, ocus ba he noda bert a dochum don Bruig ("He told her that she was preg- nant by him, and that it was he who had brought them to him in the Brugh"). Another version of the story occurs, in which Deichtine herself, with her maidens, are the metamorphosed birds. This is summarized by R. Thurneysen, in Die irische Helden und Konigsage (Halle, 1921), p. 271 (text from Egerton 1782, fol. 79r.) 20 Cf. connection of Samhuin and chain-bearing birds in the Aislinge Oenguso, p. 45 above. 21 A mbatar and larom tairnid enlaith forsin loch ocaib.

In the story of the Death of Lugaid and Derbforgaill, swan transformation is the significant factor upon which the later episodes are based. The motif of the en- chanted birds is renminiscent of the episode in the Serglige, where Fand and Li Ban come to Cu Chulainn in bird forin. In this story, however, the girl and her maid are actually described as being in swan form. Cu Chulainn badly wounds Deirbforgaill, who has come to seek his love. The effect of the stone which he casts at the womnen is their disenchantment.26 In the following passage the metamor- phosedI swans are described.27 Derbforgaill, daughter of the king of Norway loved Cu Chulainn because of the great stories told of him. She and her liaridmaid set out from the east in the form of two swans until they came to Loch Cuan, a golden chain between them. Now as Cu Cbulainn and hiis foster-brother Lugaid son of the three Findemna were by the lake one day they saw the birds. "Hfave a cast at the birds," said Lugaid. Cu Chulainn slung a stone at them so that it passed between her ribs and remained in her belly. Straightway two human forms were on the strand. "Cruel have you been to me," said the girl, "and it is to you I have come."28 23 The two women, Fand and Li Ban, appeared to Cu Chulainn in the form of the two chain- bearing birds. In the Compert (supra, p. 46) Lugh also employs mi-ysterious birds to further his pur- pose, i.e., to beget a son on Deicl-tine, and he too was probably presenit in bird form. 24 This motif is reminiiseent of the Gallo-Roman monumDents which depict a mother-goddess in company with birds. usually two in number, and sometimes seated on hier shoulders, e.g., v. Espe- randieu, plates 4256, 4L264, 4282, 326, 2181 etc. Cf. also the bird which sat on Medb's shoulder, which Cu Chtulainn killed (J. Dunn, Tadin B6 Cudilgne, p. 88), and Eistine's two birdIs in the Silva Gadelica reference to the legenid of SnAm Da tn: Is ann bdzi Diarmaid ina loingius ic Suinl Dd Eon for Sinainn .i.

("Then Diarmaid was in exile at SnAm D'a tn on the Shannon, that is two birds which N;r son of Finnchad son of Conall Cernach slew on the shoulders of the woman warrior Eistine, so that from it is said the Swimming Place of the Two Birds.") (Standish 1-I. O'Gradv, "Aided Diarmada mic Feirgusa," Silva Gadelica, i, 72 ff.) 25 One of the many examples of the magic siniging of supernatural birds causinig sleep is found in the legend of Sndmtt Dd En (The Svinimming-place of the Two Birds). Bude and his foster brother Luan visit Estiu in the form of two lovely birds. Their magic singing causes the host to sleep. 26 Disenchantment of a metamorphosed person wlhen struck by a missile is also found in Germanic contexts, and seems to be a common folk-tale motif. A passage in the Irish Nennius, describing the disenchantment of a swan by a stone thrown by the poet Mae Coise is also reminiscent of this episode.

A fifth tale containing a reference to swan transformation is the Tochmarc Etaine. Etain is married to Eocliaid Airem, king of the five fifths of Ireland. Midir, her husband in a previous existence, seeks to regain her, and she agrees to go with him provided Eochaid is willing to sell her. Eochaid plays chess with Midir, and after winning the stakes twice, loses to AMidii on the third occasion. Midir requests that he may embrace Etain. Eochaid agrees to fulfill the request at the end of a month, but he surrounds Tara with a picked war band. Eochaid an(d Etain stay in the house and the courts are locked, but nevertheless Midir gains access and appears in all his beauty before them. Eochaid agrees that Alidir shall put his arms about Etain. "I will not sell you indeed," said Eochaid, "but let him put his arms about you in the middle of the house as you are." "It shall be done," said Midir. He takes his weapons in his left hand, and the woman he took under his right arm, and bore her away through the skylight of the house. The hosts rose up in shame around the king. They beheld two swans in flight round Tara.29 Here, again, transformation is spontaneous, Etain turning into a swan upon Midir's embracing her. Just as Caer and Angus circle the loch before making for Angus' dwelling on the Boyne, so Etain and Midir circle Tara before setting out for Midir's dwelling. The last of the tales in which swan transformatioii takes place is that concern- ing the fate of the children of Ler. No early manuscript of this tale is known, nor does it appear to have been mentioned by early writers. It may thus be a com- paratively modern tale based upon what seems to be very ol0( and genuine tra- dition. However, until the question is fully studied and a satisfactory edition of the text is forthcoming, it will not be possible to pinpoint it historically in the development of the Irish tradition. The following synopsis of the story will in- dicate the nature of the bird transformations.30 Ler has four children by his wife Aobh, foster child of Bodb Derg. She dies giving birth to the last two. Bodb then gives her sister Aoife to Ler as wife. All goes well for a time until Aoife grows jealous of her husband's love for her sis- ter's children, and this emotion becomes so violent that she decides to destroy them. One day she pretends to take the children on a visit to Bodb in her chariot, planning to kill them. She compels them to bathe in Loch Dairbhreach and while they are doing so she strikes them with a druidical wand and transforms them into swans. The children ask how long they must remain in swan form, and are 29 Three tales with the above title were extant in Leabhar na h-Uidhre. The stories form remscela to the cycle of Conaire Mor. The Irish is as follows: 'Nid ririubsa im,' for Eochaid, 'acht tabrad a di laim umut for lar in tighi amal ro gabais. 'Dogentar' ol Midir.

No one will be able to release them from their enchantment until then "ocus ni tualaing caraid na comhachta da bhfhuil agaibh bhur mbreith as na reachtaibh sin" ("and no friend or power that you have will be capable of delivering you from those forms"). Aoife regrets what she has done then, but she has no power to disenchant the children herself. She does, however, permit them to retain their human speech and reason. She also tells them that they will be able to make music so beautiful that the men of the earth will sleep on account of it. Bodb avenges himself on Aoife by turning her into a demon of the air. For three hundred years he and Ler and all their followers camp by the loch-side, listening to the music and conver- sation of the birds. At the end of this period the birds must go elsewhere. They move into the ocean, and after much suffering and many years of wandering, they come to Inis Gluaire, and there Mochaomhog comes, and the birds take up their dwelling with him and keep the canonical hours and sing mass with him. He has a pair of silver chains made and puts the birds in pairs. Deoch, wife of Lairgnen, king of Connacht, hears of the birds and longs for them. Lairgnen eventually asks Mochaomhog for them, is refused and in anger snatches them from the altar. As soon as he lays hands on them their bird cloaks (tlacht cochaill) fall from them and they become ancient withered people. Mochaomhog curses Lairgnen, baptizes the children of Ler and they die and are buried. In each of the tales considered above the chain-bearing birds are aquatic,3' usually specified as swans. In the case of the unnamed birds, sufficient details are supplied to make their identification as swans reasonably likely. The chain- wearing birds are always transformed, the birds invariably being the form.at that moment chosen by supernatural beings. In the four tales in which the swan is specified, the bird shows characteristics which it retains consistently throughout the tradition. That is to say it is invariably associated with good, or rather with non-harmful people or deities. We do not find that evil people take on swan form in the Celtic tradition.32 In the stories of Angus, Derbforgaill and the Children 31 In the story of the conception of C(i Chulainn, the chain-bearing birds are unlikely to have been swans; their destructive nature is stressed, and this neither agrees with the ornithological facts, nor does it concur with the usual character of the swan in Celtic mythology. It is more probable that the mysterious birds were geese. Geese are grazing birds, and these particular birds eat up all the roots, grass, aiad herbs. The fact that flocks of wild geese were accustomed to graze the plains in Ireland, and that their grazing habits had been observed at an early period is attested by a passage in the Tain: "Welcome to you Lugaid," cried Cu( Chulainn, "Should a flock of birds graze upon the plain of Murthemne you shall have a wild goose with half the other." (Dunn, op. cit., p. 101.) Caesar more- over testifies to the sanctity of the goose in Britain (p. 3 supra), and the fine goose which is figured together with a salmon on a symbol stone from Easterton of Roseisle (late though the stone may be, dating possibly from the seventh century A.D.) may further testify to the bird's sanctity. (S. Cruden, The Early Christian and Pictish Monuments of Scotland [Edinburgh, 1957), plate 3.) Moreover, the noise made by geese in flight is rather more musical than that of swans, and the grouping described above could apply to a -V- formation composed of nine groups of twenty. These birds then were probably thought of as supernatural birds resembling geese in beauty and aggressiveness. 32 An interesting example of malevolent chain-bearing birds occurs in a Welsh triad: Gall mab Dysgyfdavt a ladawd deu ede (ryn) Gvendoleu. Ac yeu o eur a oed arnadunt. dwy gelein or Kymry a yssynt ar eu kinyaw a dwy ar eu kwynos. ("Gall son of Dysgyfdavt who slew the two birds of Gwend- doleu. They had a yoke of gold on them. Two corpses of the Kymry they ate for their dinner and two for their supper").</page><page sequence="13">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 51 of Ler, and in the Compert and the Serglige, the birds are at some stage repre- sented as wearing chains of gold and silver, retained by Caer and her companions when in human form, an unusual feature in the Celtic chain traditions.33 The chains are introduced with the Christian element in the story of the Children of Ler, showing that the significance of the motif was here misunderstood and strengthening the case for the theory that the story, although late in the form in which we now have it, belonged, or the motifs contained in it belonged to a very much older, native tradition. The supernatural swans in the Aislinge Oenguso are described as having golden ringlets about their heads. The nature of this extraordinary decoration is prob- lematic. However, a passage from a modern Irish tale of the "international" swan-maiden type may help to interpret this head adornment.34 In the story of The King's Son and the White-bearded Scolog, a king of Ireland has one son who sets out to find the youngest daughter of the white-beared Scolog. After many adventures, the king's son is told that at a certain lake, twelve swans will alight and take the crests from their heads. This action causes the swan skins to fall from them, and they will then rise up as exceedingly lovely women.35 The young man is to take the crest of the youngest and put it in his bosom, and to take the crests of the others also, but to restore them to their owners. The golden ringlets may then have been some sort of decorative crest. Although swans are not crested birds, the crest, like the horn, seems to have had some significance of its own. The frequency with which all crest-bearing birds figure on the cult objects discussed below - for example the shag, cormorant, tufted duck, etc. - indicates that such birds were imbued with particular religious significance. Moreover, non-crested birds, such as the swan, have crests added, and birds already crested sometimes have the crest stylized to form a single horn.36 It may then be a vague, uncomprehended trace of some early religious tradition which lingers in these seemingly fantastic descriptions. I am indebted to Mrs Rachel Bromwich for this reference (Peniarth 16) and for access to the triad. The carnivorous nature of these birds would seem to indicate that they were ravens or other flesh- eating birds, and this would tend to link them up with Owein's mysterious ravens, for main reference to which see G. &amp; T. Jones' translation of the Mabinogion, Everyman series (1949), "The Dream of Rhonabuwy, " pp. 145 ff. 33 Although it is implied that these beautiful chains were the insignia of metamorphosis, it is never indicated that they were the medium of transformation, and that by donning or doffing them, the transformed beings could take on human or bird form. In most of these tales, transformation seems to have taken place at will. Only in the Ler story are the birds actually put under spells. 34 Aarne-Thompson, Types of the Folk-tale (Helsinki, 1928), 400.

For example, the chain-bearing tradition in connection with swans is perpetuated in an early modern literary poem.37 Although the poem is late and is concerned with Arthurian characters, the sentiment it expresses is immediately within the tradition with which we are concerned. The bird is once again associated with the virtuous,38 and the fact that it wears a chain, by which it is here led, points to metamorphosis. Although the poem is probably of seventeenth-century origin, it contains these elements of an earlier tradition, and may be based on a genuine legend. The bird's reactions constitute a chastity test.39 The Irish text is published by O'Rahilly in Gadelica.40 I translate as follows: A comely white-toothed sorcerer came to the household of the King of the World; he had a swan with him going to the palace, moving tranquilly, led by a chain. Knowledge of his secret was the worse for women in the household of the jealous king Arthur; tidings from the sweet gentle swan, to their men it is sad that she came. The gentle bird from the waves did not accept food in the palace from the nurse; it did not go from the fair white-palmed woman without taking honeysweet wine. The Summary The beautiful swan which the gruagach brought with her that would not take food in 87 Ed. by T. O'Rahilly, Gadelica, i, 246 f., from three eighteenth-century manuscripts, all the writers apparently belonging to S. E. Ulster. 38 As the above passages indicate, the swan is a bird which is invariably connected with non- harmful beings in the Irish tradition. 39 This constitutes a variant of the well-known Court Mfantel but seems to be the only example of the swans' use as the test. (Cross, Motif-Index, H411.17*.) 40 The Irish is as follows: Tainig go teaglilach Riogh an Domhain gruagach deidgheal dathamhail; eala 'na laimh leis don mbrugh ag siubhal go saimh ar slabbradh.

Another interesting if oblique reference connecting birds and chains in a Christian context is found in the early Irish text of Broccan's Hymn.42 The translation of the passage is: "She blessed the fluttering bird and brought it into her hand."43 This is explained: a silver chain a certain man gave as an offering to Brigit, and she bestowed it on the little girls with her, for they were displeased that nothing should be given to them. A certain leper came to her to beg something of her, and she gave him the chain unknown to the girls, who wept when they knew. She said to them "What equivalent would you seek for it?" "We would be pleased," said they, "To have that bird, for it is beautiful." Brigit blessed the bird and it became tame from hand to hand. And so the name of the place in which this miracle took place is the 'Land of the Bird' from that time forth.44 Another reference to the silver chain given to Brigit occurs in W. Stokes, Lismore Lives, p. 48: "Once upon a time, the queen of Crimthan, son of Enna Cennsalach, king of Leinster, came with a silver chain as offering to Brigit. The semblance of a human shape was on one of the ends thereof, and an apple of silver at the other end." The obscure reference in Broccan's Hymn to the giving of a bird and its wonder- ful taming, in exchange for a valued silver chain, and the use of the episode to explain a place name, would seem to contain elements of a legend about a won- derful chain-bearing bird, perhaps comparable to the birds in the Ler story whose chain (of pagan significance) is made for them by the Christian saint Mochaomhog. The presence of the chain itself is of interest, and this is intensified by its association with the miraculously tamed bird. It may be noted that in all the examples cited above the chain appears in con- junction with birds of a supernatural kind, usually transformed deities or super- natural beings. The chain, however, although in general it seems to have served as the insigne of metamorphosis from human to bird form, does appear in con- nection with dogs on one or two occasions in the more recent Irish and Scottish Gaelic tradition, where transformation is either implied or is quite likely in the context.45 41 The sex of the gruagach seems to change here. 42 Stokes and Strachan, Thesaurus Palaeo-hibernicus, ii (Cambridge, England, 1903), 64. 43 Senais inn en luamnech conidnimbert inna laim.

She was a fit mother of children for him; she put a golden chain about him; the sea should not drown him while he wore it nor should sharp spear points pierce him. Thence came [the name] not in falsehood does every poet in succession relate it on this side and that about the sea, the pliant chain of the modest wife of Etar. (Todd Lecture Series, x, 104-105) It might also be noted that the chain figures prominently in descriptions of sacred vessels and cauldrons in Celtic tradition, and while it is not proposed to enter into the problem of the origins of the Grail legend, attention is drawn to some of these references ill the footnote below, as being relevant to the later discussion of the Hallstatt cult objects.47 ject matter of a Scottish Gaelic ballad entitled Am Bron Binn (The Sweet Sorrow) which seems to contain Arthurian elemeilts, given by a native of North Uist in 1869. In her description of the en- chanted castle she mentions that the hounds wore glittering chains of gold and silver (p. 26). This may simply refer to the richness of the castle, but since it is an enchanted place it is possible that the hounds were under metamorphosis, or at least supernatural. Again, in the early Irish story of Tdin Bo Fraich (ed. Byrne and Dillon, Medieval and Modern Irish Series, v), Fraech's seven hounds, given to him by Boand, are described as having silver chains with a ball of gold between them. The dogs here clearly belong to the otherworld, and the chains of silver may indicate this. A striking passage in the Tmin describes how the Morrigan, the crow/raven goddess of war, goes against Cu( Chulainn in the form of a white red-eared heifer (the color of Otherworld cows) "with fifty heifers about her and a chain of silvered bronze between each two of the heifers" (Dunn, p. 169). The chains indicate that these companions of the bird goddess in cow form are supernatural and transformed. 46 Bend Etair I (Todd Lecture Series, x, 104).

"A name for a cauldron of covetousness which was made by the artists. Thus it is. It has nine chains out of it, though it is not larger than the head of a large cingit. There is a hole at the end of every chain, with nine artists standing round it, while the company sang, each with the point of his spear fixed in the hole of the chain that was next him. And whosoever gave (one) of them a gift, it was into the cauldron he put it, whence it was called Cauldron of Covetousness."

"And they had a caul-</page><page sequence="17">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 55 We have seen from the above discussion, then, that motifs occur in early Irish literary contexts which, while they may at first glance appear to be pure fantasy, upon closer examination seem to have such an underlying consistency of detail and feeling as to make us hesitate before dismissing them out of hand as mere decorations of the storytellers. The idea of gods and goddesses taking on swan form, their supernatural character indicated by the presence of chains and elaborate neck ornaments, so unique in related contemporary contexts, occurs frequently in the religious imagery of Hallstatt Europe. It would thus seem that the Irish tradition cannot have been entirely uninfluenced by this earlier religious tradition from related culture groups in Europe. An examination of early European cult objects reveals two main factors: that the swan and aquatic birds, generally, had a widespread religious signifi- cance, and that they were associated with solar cults. Unfortunately, there are no texts to provide us with details of the importance of these birds in the re- ligious life of the proto-Celtic, Celtic, and Germanic peoples. Hence we must draw our conclusions entirely from an examination of the contexts in which these sacred birds appear, keeping the Irish texts in mind. Any study of the material remains makes clear the fact that the Celtic and Germanic peoples worshipped a solar deity or deities, connected with water, one of whose most consistent attributes or symbols was the swan or duck. It is evident that the cult of the swan/duck covered a very wide geographical area of Europe. One of the most frequent representations of the solar swan is in connection with a bark, which bears swan heads; it also appears drawing a dron, coire sainte was its name. Each of their companies had a cauldron and it was a cauldron of white silver, and there were nine chains of brass from each cauldron and there was a hook of gold on each chain, and the reason it is called coire 8ainte is that they used to put into it all the gold and silver they got. Or it was called cauldron of pleasantness because they used to drink pleasant ale out of it, and the nine best of the company were playing melody around it while the poem was being sung." The first passage brings to mind the cauldron chariot from Skallerup; the vessel is placed on four wheels, and from the cauldron come pendentives ending in pieces of metal like miniature spear-points. A supernatural chain also occurs in connection with the cauldron seen by Pryderi in the enchanted caer "as it were in the middle of the caer floor, he could see a fountain with marble work around it, and on the edge of the fountain a golden bowl fastened to four chains, and that upon a marble slab, and the chains ascending into the air, and he could see no end to them . . . " (Jones, p. 46; I Williams, Pedeir Keinc y Mabinogi (Cardiff, 1930), p. 56). In the Scottish Gaelic ballad, Am Bron Binn the following occurs: Latha dhomh seoladh ri a bhuin chunncas slabhruidh tighinn a nuas cha do ghabh mi sgreamh no sgaoim chaidh mi oirr' am dheann a suas. One day sailing by its base, I saw a chain descending, I was neither repelled nor frightened, I swiftly climbed it (or was drawn up by it). Chain-bearing cauldrons figure on Gaulish coins of the third, second and first centuries B.C. A coin of the Baiocassii shows a horse mounted by a great bird which holds the reins in its claws. Be- neath the horse is a cauldron with chains. The motif of the cauldron beneath a quadruped is common at this period. (A. Blanchet, Manuel de numismatiquefranQai8e [Paris, 1912], i, Fig. 42.)</page><page sequence="18">56 Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion chariot, which in some cases contains a deity.48 Other representations of stylized swans appear on cult objects from Hungary, from the. eastern Alps and Italy, on which the birds appear to be linked together by chains, the chain of the foremost bird attached in one case49 to a solar circle, and, in another instance to a representation of the setting sun. One of the most striking representations in this context is that of a bronze swan-head and neck, a huge chain coming from under the bird's beak, several of the links still in existence.A0 A stylized corimo- rant with horns in place of the crest also has a chain emerging from under its throat, while another stylized swan has two sets of rings about its neck like those decorating the swan on the chariot from Czechoslovakia discussed above. Here we have several instances of swans in religious contexts, associated with necklet-wearing idols, barks and chariots, themselves wearing neck-rings, or having chains coming from their necks. Over and above these chain-wearing birds, there are many miscellaneous complex cult objects consisting of, for ex- ample, a crude central anthropomorphic figure having bird heads for hands, from which are suspended chains, attached in some cases to a circular plate of metal from which are suspended other chains from which hang such things as cocks and other birds of various kinds, beast heads, and "swallow-tail" objects. In many of these objects, bird and anthropomorphic figure are combined, the bird sometimes completely dominating the human form. It seems then that the inhabitants of northern and central Europe worshipped a god or gods associated with the sun and with thermal waters, who was sym- bolized by, and perhaps himself appeared under the guise of, the swan or other aquatic bird. Over and above this, the chain itself seems to have been of some religious importance, and was perhaps used as a talisman against evil (the chain- bearing complex ornaments would seem to have been designed for suspen- sion, perhaps on a chain round the neck or waist),51 and as a symbol of divinity and magic powers. The fact that the sacred birds were adorned with necklets and chains or were represented as being linked to something by chains would naturally imbue the chain itself with a certain sacred significance, and a chain-bearing bird would thus come to be representative of the god in bird form. 48 One of the most striking representations of this kind is the Dupljaja idol (Czechoslovakia). There are actually two figures from this region, covered with astral siglns, and both wearing elaborate torques. The deity in the swan-drawn chariot is beaked, covered with astral signs, and stands in the chariot. Two swans pull it and a third swan slightly smaller in size is figured behind them. The two foremost birds have three circles round their necks which would seem to represent necklets. Here one is reminded both of the Irish swans and chain-bearing non-specified birds, which are frequently represented as being in the service of some supernatural being, and of the Germanic legend of the swan knight alighting from his swan-drawn boat. This chariot is illustrated by Kossack, op. cit., Plate I. An interesting Gaulish chariot from Ohnenheim, Alsace, has four wheels and a throne, is richly ornamented and has rows of "musical" rings down either side to make a tinkling sound when in motion. A pole chariot from Silesia (Gross-Perschnitz) is decorated with the head of a swan which holds a ring in its beak from which hang three resonant rings. These chariots, which seem to have been both religious and funerary in significance date from the Bronze and Iron Ages. 41 Kossack, Plate 9. 50 Kossack, Plate 14. Cf. the chariot from Silesia mentioned in inote 48 above. 5' Cf. gold chains in the literary section above.</page><page sequence="19">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 57 If the links of the chains, or rings suspended from the bird representations gave out a tinkling sound, as would be the case with the chariot from Silesia men- tioned above, the association of music with chain-bearing birds would also have some basis in fact. It would, therefore, be possible to give some explanation such as the following to explain the presence of the chain-bearing birds in Celtic literary tradition. The Celts on the continent of Europe must have been familiar with cult objects such as those described above, and it also seems to be beyond doubt that when they ceased to have any active religious significance, an oral tradition would grow up, into which the imagery of these once-symbolic objects would be in- corporated. Eventually, the religious origins of the verbal imagery would be- come obscured and the chain-bearing birds, and cauldrons, and the deities con- nected with them would all eventually become wonder elements and magical beings in purely "literary" contexts. It must not be overlooked that the Irish themselves may have been familiar with actual cult objects, brought over from the continent, or native to Ireland, as certain archaeological finds may indicate.52 As we have seen, this solar imagery was known over a wide area of Europe, and, althoughi the persistence and the deliberate cultivation of the oral tradition amongst the Celtic peoples was (and still is) phenomenal, some faint echo of these early religious practices should be discernible in the later literary and folk tradi- tions of other peoples. This is indeed found in some mediaeval Germanic contexts, all the examples being later than the Irish texts,53 differing in detail, but all con- cerned with chain-bearing swans or supernatural beings. Before examining some of these examples, it should be re-emphasized that in the Irish material the swan- maiden tale type and the chain-bearing metamorphosed birds belong to two different traditions.54 In the Germanic contexts the chain-bearing birds are in- variably connected with the international swan-maiden tale type, but show ele- ments which link them with the earlier "mythological" Irish traditions.55 A mediaeval tale, which seems to parallel closely the group of Irish tales discussed above, describes how a hero sees a girl bathing in a lake, and takes the chain of gold which she has removed, and she can no longer fly away. He marries her and she has seven sons, each with a necklace by which they could become swans.56 In the Irish legends, as stressed above, the transformations do not seem to have been 52 For example, the horse goad or flesh fork from Dunaverney, Co. Antrim, decorated with swans and ravens in the round, and the oval object from Lisnacroghera, in bronze, on which are set two rav- ens in the round. B3 Apart from the story of the Children of Ler, which is contained in a late manuscript. 5 Footnote 16 above. BB The straightforward swan-maiden type is found, for example, in the VolundarkviZa, of which it forms a part, and in the Helreid Brynhildar. 56 Cf. the ballad of the Gay Goshawk, in which the bird-lover turns his seven sons by the king's daughter into seven swans (P. Buchan, Ballads of the North [Edinburgh, 1875] pp. 48 if.). A useful collection of swan-maiden stories and an account of the Knight of the Swan legend is contained in S. Baring-Gould's Curious Myths of the Middle Ages (London, 1877), pp. 561 if. The story figures in Li Romans de Dolopathos, edd. C. Brunet et Anatole de Montaglon (Paris, 1856), pp. 317 ff. where it constitutes the seventh story of the seven sages.</page><page sequence="20">58 Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion thought of as being dependent on the chains, although these were the badges of metamorphosis. Any discussion of the chain-bearing swans of the Germanic tradition must take some account of the legend of the Knight of the Swan, and while it is not proposed to enter into the complex Lohengrin controversy here, brief mention will be made of the legend. The outline of the story is as follows.57 A bark drawn by a swan, attached to it by a silver chain, was seen on the Rhine at Cologne. From it a knight leapt ashore and the bird and vessel disappeared.58 This legend seems to have become confused with another legend resembling the Irish Ler story. Seven children were born at a birth to the wife of a king, each with a silver chain round its neck. Men were sent to slay the children but only took away their necklets. Upon the removal of the chains, the children became swans. One of the children was absent at the time and retained the magic chain, and thus became protector of the swans. The birds eventually regained their chains and their human forms. One chain had been melted down and the owner of it could not take on human form again. He remained a swan and drew the bark of the Swan Knight. This story in many ways resembles the Ler story and although there are no early Irish texts, the material contained in the late manuscript seems to belong to the earliest stratuirm of the Irish tradition, and some version of the story may possibly have been carried to Europe at the time of the Irish monastic movement. Although the parallelism of these Germanic and Irish "chain" legends is such as to suggest direct borrowing in one direction or the other, we have seen that this very motif of chain-bearing swans occurs in conjunction with other numerous bird/chain complexes, and with ships, chariots, god representations and solar symbols of every kind, in cult objects dating from the Hallstatt period and earlier, at a time when we may speak of the proto-Celts and related peoples, and perhaps of a common Celto-Germanic religious culture of the peripheral regions. Existing traditions may have been developed and reinforced by later contact with Irish ecclesiastics on the continent. The evidence suggests that the literary motif had its origins in the early religious monuments and cult objects of northern and cen- tral Europe. In the above discussion, we have not, in fact, been concerned with the identi- fication of literary characters with deities. Rather, the aim has been to indicate that a closely related group of recurrent traditions, literary and folklore, has parallels in archaeological remains which clearly have a religious significance. This is of importance in pointing out the continuity of tradition in the early period, and would imply that what originated as a religious motif, or set of motifs at an archaeological period, survived indefinitely as a folklore and literary motif. It seems that the religious association of these cult objects and the practices with which they were associated have survived as wonder elements in literary tales, the religious significance overlooked or misunderstood (as in the chain incident in 57 Baring-Gould, pp. 561 ff. 58 Cf. the statuette of Sequana, goddess of the Seine; see note 5 above.</page><page sequence="21">Chain Symbolism in Celtic Religion 59 the story of the Children of Ler) by the scribes who finally committed them to writing. The details, however, have been faithfully preserved so as to make the wonder element identifiable with the earlier belief. The literary evidence for Celtic religion is very slight, but when it can be closely paralleled by and substantiated by monumental and other archaeological evi- dence, and by the evidence of epigraphy, treating of incontestably religious mat- ters, then its importance is vastly increased, and it may make a valuable contribu- tion to an understanding of the native religious idiom of the Celtic peoples.
