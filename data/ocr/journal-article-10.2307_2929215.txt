<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEAN-PAUL SARTRE William Faulkner's Sartoris With the necessary perspective, good novels come to resemble completely natural phenomena; one tends to forget that they have authors, one accepts them as one does stones or trees, because they are present, because they exist. Light in Augast is one of these hermetic, mineral-like works. One does not accept Sartoris in just this way, and that is what makes this book so precious. Faulkner reveals himself in it; his hand and his craft are easily discernable throughout. I have come to realize the great resource of his art: disloyalty. I know that all art is disloyal. A painting distorts its perspective. There are, however, "true" paintings, and there are those which consciously deceive. This "man" we discover -in Light in August-I think of the "man" of Faulkner in the same way that one thinks of the "man" of Dostoevsky or of Meredith-this divine animal who lives without God, lost from the moment of his birth, and intent on destroying himself; cruel, moral even in murder; then miraculously saved, neither by death nor in death, but in the final moments which precede death; heroic in torment, in the most abject humiliations of the flesh: I had accepted him without reservations. I had never forgotten his proud and threatening face, his blinded eyes. I found him again in Sartoris. I recognized the "somber arrogance" of Bayard. Yet I can no longer accept the "man" of Faulkner: he is an illusion. Just a matter of lighting. There is a certain formula: it consists in not telling, remaining hidden, dishonestly secretive,-telling a little. We are furtively informed that old Bayard is shocked by the unexpected return of his grandson; almost imperceptibly, in a truncated sentence, which risks passing unnoticed, and which, it is hoped, will pass nearly unnoticed. Following this, when we expect thunderbolts, we are shown gestures, prolonged indefinitely. Faulkner is not unaware of our impatience. He plays upon its effect, by talking loquaciously about gestures. There are others who employ similar devices: the realists, Dreiser. But Dreiser's descriptions attempt to teach, they are documen- tary. The gestures here (putting on boots, mounting a staircase, jumping on a horse) do not attempt to describe, but rather to conceal. We watch for the one which will betray Bayard's anguish; but the Sartorises are never intoxicated, they never betray themselves through gestures. Yet these idols, whose gestures have the appearance of threatening rituals, also possess consciousness. They speak, they reflect upon themselves, they stir. Faulkner knows this. On occasions he carelessly unveils to us a consciousness. But this is like the charlatan who shows us the box when 95</page><page sequence="2">Yale French Studies it is empty. What do we see? Nothing more than what one can see from the outside: gestures. Then again we startle the unsuspecting conscious- ness on the verge of sleep. Once again gestures: tennis, piano, whiskey, conversations. And this is what I refuse to accept; everything conspires to make us believe that the consciousness is always empty, always thus fleeting. Why? Because consciousness is too human a thing. The Aztec gods do not have these delicate conversations with themselves. But Faulk- ner knows very well that consciousness is not and cannot be empty. He realizes this well enough to write: "She forced herself once more to think of nothing, to keep her consciousness immersed, as a little dog that one keeps under water until he has stopped struggling." Yet he fails to tell us what there is inside this consciousness that one would like to drown. It is not that he wishes exactly to conceal it from us; he wishes rather that we guess what it is, because divination renders magical whatever it touches. And the gestures begin again. We should like to say, "too many gestures," as one said to Mozart, "too many notes"; too many words also. Faulkner's volubility, his abstract style, superb, anthropomorphic in the manner of a preacher: still more illusions. The style congeals everyday gestures, weights them, overwhelms them with epic splendor, and makes them sink like leaden dogs-a contrived effect. This is the loathsome and overbearing monotony, this ritual of the everyday, Faulkner aims at; gestures, this is the world of ennui. These wealthy people, without either work or leisure, proper yet uncultivated, prisoners on their own soil, at once master and slave of their negroes, are victims of their own tedium, and try to fill time with their gestures. But this boredom (has Faulkner always been able to distinguish the tedium of his heroes from that of his readers?) is only an appearance, a defense Faulkner assumes against us, that the Sartorises assume against themselves. Ennui is in the social order, it is the unvarying languor of everything that can be observed, heard, touched. Faulkner's landscapes suffer from the same tedium as his characters. The real drama is behind, behind the lethargy, behind the gestures, behind the consciousness. Sud- denly, from the depth of this drama, surges the Act, like an aerolite: an Act-finally something happens, a message. But Faulkner continues to deceive us; he rarely describes these Acts. What he is doing is meeting and resolving an old problem in the technique of the novel: Acts are the essential element of the novel. One prepares them with care and then, when they happen, they are bare and glossy as bronze; infinitely simple, they slip between our fingers. One can say no more about them; it should merely suffice to designate them. But Faulkner does not name 96</page><page sequence="3">JEAN-PAUL SARTRE them, does not ever speak of them and, consequently, suggests that they are ineffable, beyond language. He will only show their results: an old man dead in his chair, an auto overturned in the river and two feet which appear above the water. Motionless and brutal, as solid and compact as the Act is fleeting, these results appear and unfold definitive, inexplic- able, in the midst of the fine, dense outpour of everyday gestures. Later, these indecipherable bits of violence are transformd into "stories": they will be designated, explained, and recounted. All these men, all these families have their stories. The Sartorises carry the weighty burden of two wars, of two series of exploits: the Civil War, in which Grand- father Bayard died, the war of 1914, in which John Sartoris died. Stories appear and disappear, pass from mouth to mouth, are drawn out in the company of everyday gestures. They are not entirely from the past; they represent rather a "super-present": "As usual, old man Falls had brought John Sartoris into the room with him . . . Freed as he was of time and flesh, he was a far more palpable presence than either of the two old men who sat shouting periodically into one another's deafness." They create a poetry of the present and of its fatality: "fatal immortality and immortal fatality." It is with stories that Faulkner's heroes forge their destinies: across these carefully constructed narratives, embellished some- times by several generations, an unmentionable Act, buried for years, motions to other Acts, charms them, entices them as a rod attracts the thunderbolt. The artful power of words, of stories-Faulkner, however, does not believe in these incantations: ". . . what had only been a wild escapade of two youngsters, thoughtless and unheeding, inebriated by their own youth, developed into the highest form of gallantry and of tragic beauty, to the point where two angels, distraught and fallen, had, in modifying the course of events ... . ennobled the history of the race . . ." He never allows himself to be entirely taken in, he knows what they are worth, since it is he who tells about them, since he is, as is Sherwood Anderson, "a storyteller, a fabricator." He, however, dreams of a world in which stories should be believed, where they would truly act upon men; and his novels depict this world of which he dreams. The "technique of disorder" of The Sound and the Fury and of Light in Augast, these inextricable mixtures of the past and the present, are well known. I believe that I have found the double origin of this in Sartoris: it is, on the one hand, the irresistable need of telling a story, of halting the most pressing action to interject a narratives characteristic trait, it appears to me, of many lyrical novelists-and, on the other hand, this faith, half sincere, 97</page><page sequence="4">Yale French Studies half conjured up, in the magical power of the story. But when he wrote Sartoris, he had not yet put his technique to the test; he manipulated passages from the present to the past, from gestures to stories, with considerable awkwardness. Here is, then, the man he presents to us, and whom he wishes us to accept. This man eludes us. One cannot grasp him through his gestures, which are only a facade, nor through his stories, which are fabrications, nor through his acts, lightning flashes which defy description. Yet beyond the acts and the words, beyond the empty consciousness, the man exists. We have a presentiment of a true drama, a kind of intelligible symbol which explains everything. What is this exactly? The decline of race or of family, an Adlerian inferiority complex, a repressed sexual urge? Sometimes the one, at other times another: it depends upon the narra- tives and the characters; often Faulkner fails to inform us about it. And, furthermore, he really does not care much. What concerns him is rather the "nature" of this new being he suggests to us: a nature preeminently poetical and magical, whose contradictions are numerous but veiled. Caught up in the midst of psychological manifestations, this "nature" (what other name can we give it?) participates in psychical existence. This is not even completely the workings of the unconscious, for it appears frequently that the men controlled by it, turn round towards it and contemplate it. But, on the other hand, it is as immutable and stable as an evil destiny. Faulkner's heroes carry it inside them from the moment of their birth. It has the persistency of stone or rock, it is a "thing"-a "chose-esprit," a solidified spirit, opaque, following in the wake of con- sciousness, shadowy, yet limpid in essence. This is the magical object, par excellence. Faulkner's creatures are victims of sympathetic magic: a stifling atmosphere of sorcery surrounds them. And this is what I meant by "disloyalty." These magic spells are not possible, not even realizable. So Faulkner is careful not to make us conceive of them. All his methods conspire merely to suggest them. Is he wholly disloyal? I do not think so. If he lies, it is generally to himself. A curious passage from Sartoris gives us the key to his falsehoods and to his sincerity: "Your Arlens and Sabatinis talk a lot, and nobody ever had more to say and more trouble saying it than old Dreiser." "But they have secrets," she explained. "Shakespeare doesn't have any secrets. He tells everything." "I see. Shakespeare had no sense of discrimination and no instinct for reticence. In other words, he wasn't a gentleman," he suggested. "Yes . . . that's what I mean." "And so, to be a gentleman, you must have secrets." "Oh, you make me tired." 98</page><page sequence="5">JEAN-PAUL SARTRE Ambiguous dialogue, doubtless ironical; for Narcissa is not especially intelligent, and Michael Arlen and Sabatini are inferior writers. And yet it seems to me that Faulkner reveals a great deal of himself. If Narcissa, perhaps, is a bit deficient in literary taste, her instinct, on the contrary, is sure, when it causes her to choose Bayard, a man who has secrets. Horace Benbow is perhaps right in liking Shakespeare; but he is weak and loquacious, he tells everything: he is not a man. The men whom Faulkner admires-the mulatto in Light in August, Bayard Sartoris, the father in Absalom, Absalom!-have their secrets. They do not tell them themselves. Faulkner's humanism is doubtless the only acceptable one: he despises our well-adjusted conscience, our conscience with its engineer- like garrulousness. But does he not realize that his imposingly somber figures have only an exterior dimension? Is he deceived by his own art? He doubtless would not be satisfied with our secrets being forced back into the unconscious. He dreams of an absolute obscurity in the very depth of the "conscious," of a complete obscurity that we should ourselves create within ourselves. Silence: silence outside of us, silence inside us; this is the impossible dream of an ultra-puritanical stoicism. Does he lie to us? What does he do when he is alone? Does he get along with the inexhaustible small-talk of his too-human consciousness? To answer these questions we would have to know him.
