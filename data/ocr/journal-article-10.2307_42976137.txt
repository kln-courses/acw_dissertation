<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter One Introduction: Blueprint, Scaffolding, and Main Construction Prologue The ideas quoted in this opening have influenced my thinking. Their in- clusion serves to set the tone for this work. I never knew Mills personally; Entwistle has been a valued colleague; Wingo was my doctoral studies mentor at the University of Michigan. His work provides much of the scaffolding for this book. C. Wright Mills made an important distinction between a model and a theory. "A model is a more or less systematic inventory of the elements to which we must pay attention if we are to understand something. It is not true or false; it is useful and adequate to varying degrees. A theory, in contrast, is a statement which can be proved true or false, about the causal weight and the relations of the elements of the model."1 Harold Entwistle forwarded the following thesis: "The job of theory is to evoke judgement rather than rote obedience. The application of theory to practice means bringing critical intelligence to bear on practical tasks rather than merely implementing good advice . . . . That is, some initia- tive is required from the practitioner in discovering the pertinence of theory to his or her own practical situation."2 Entwistle went on to make an analogy between what theory can do for educational practice and the role of liberal education vis-à-vis life itself. In Entwistle's view, "the point of a liberal education is not that one arrives at a [particular] destination but that one travels with a different point of view. ... In [R.S.I Peters' sense, a liberal education transforms one's perception of what the prob- lems are, what opportunities are offered by life, what new interests might enrich one's daily experiences . . . . Theory of education . . .does not provide [merely! knowledge and skills which are applicable to a given practical situation: it provides [insteadl new perspective such that one</page><page sequence="2">2 Introduction confronts educational problems and opportunities from a different point of view. Educational theory can provide a liberal education, such that the teachers' reflection on practice becomes intelligent, morally sensitive, capable of making finer conceptual distinctions, and more subtle. . . . The justification for educational theory is the same as the justification for liberal education itself. The teacher reflecting upon teaching equipped with more subtle educational theory, is much like the liberally educated citizen reflecting upon public affairs."3 My philosophy of education teacher and mentor argued that, during comparatively settled times, teachers have not been highly motivated to question accepted ideas and practices; speculative activity is often frowned upon by the community. Such conditions can help make a teacher's life rather comfortable- but dull. It is apparent to many, if not most people, that our society is faced by many disagreements about numerous issues and beliefs. As a result, theory becomes important not only for the educa- tional reformer, but also for those who wish to conserve and even roll back what change has brought about. In fact, "whether we think of our- selves as liberal or conservative, radical or regressive, we cannot escape in these times the necessity of attending to our basic ideas. The luxury of operating our schools on the basis of ideas 'everybody knows are right' is gone, provided that it ever . . . existed. ... A certain lag between theory and practice is . . . present in any period. Today's question, however, is not so much the relation of certain practices to an accepted body of theory; it is rather what practices and what theories are to be accepted. Thus in unsettled times, at least, the theory of education be- comes controversial and dialectical. In this sense, it becomes philosophi- cal."4 I maintain, along with Wingo, that although it may seem strange to expect educators to be philosophers, can we afford to have them be any- thing else? Philosophy and philosophy of education are too important to be thought about and "done" by only the few, especially during these times which feature the inability or refusal of many people to agree with the orthodoxies of others. In the absence of agreed-upon orthodoxies and grand narratives- and in societies that claim to be democratic- do- ing philosophy with regard to society and school becomes the responsi- bility of all citizens and educators, not just those who make a living in this field of study. I I begin this intellectual work by considering how our near and remote ancestors tried and often succeeded in making sense of their worlds. This</page><page sequence="3">Introduction 3 central, continuing, human endeavor provides us with the advantage of belonging to a heritage consisting of various attempts to understand our- selves within physical, social, intellectual, and spiritual contexts. Our search for understanding, or love of wisdom, is often called philosophy, although this great endeavor is not limited to philosophy- and certainly not to phi- losophers' formal work. Standing on the shoulders of those who came before us is beneficial; however, it is still necessary for each of us to construct our own operative understanding of ourselves as well as the world in which we live. We change ourselves and our world as we think and act upon our hypotheses: The things we endeavor to understand and solve are affected by our individual and/or collective interventionist la- bors. Such labor profoundly affects us all. You are invited to examine and reflect upon your own foundational or ultimate beliefs and value system. You are encouraged to think about their sources, development, and the potential and actual action consequences. The accent is on your educa- tional philosophy, because this book is mainly intended for those who seek to deepen and broaden their understanding of teaching and learn- ing, as well as for the many who are interested in the broader idea of education. You are invited to consider the thesis that the ancient classical Greeks invented philosophy in the West because they had a need for and confi- dence in constructing an explanatory model that would assist them in making sense of their personal and social lives. My reference to Greece and the West does not reflect a bias; there is no doubt that indigenous people in the "Americas," Africans, Chinese, Indians, original Australians et al.5 also "did philosophy." My life and intellectual experiences in the West and its civilization^) makes it natural to express myself within its framework. Many Europeans and those who left Europe to settle around the world tend to exaggerate the "glory that was Greece." Edith Hamilton's writing represents well the point I seek to make. Before Greece all religion was magical. ... It was [huļmankind's sole defense against fearful powers. ... A magical universe was so terrifying because it was [perceived of as] so irrational, and therefore . . . incalculable. There was no [belief in a] dependable relation . . . between cause and effect. It . . . [can] readily be seen what it did to the human intellect to live in such an atmo- sphere .... Fear is of all the emotions the most brutalizing ... In one little country the terror was banished. The Greeks . . . changed a world that was full of fear into . . . [one] of beauty. . . . We know . . . that in Homer men [the contemporary critique of the ancient Greeks' failure to include women is war- ranted] are free and fearless. There are no fearful powers to be propitiated . . . very human like gods [and goddesses] inhabit a . . . delightful heaven. . . . The universe has become rational. . . . "All things were in confusion until Mind</page><page sequence="4">4 Introduction came and set them in order." That mind was Greek [in the West], and the first exponent of it we know about was Homer. . . . [His] universe is quite rational . . . well ordered and very well lit. When night comes . . . the gods go to sleep. There are no mysterious doings .... The stamp of Greek genius is everywhere on his two epics [the Iliad and the Odyssey], in the banishment of the ugly . . . frightful and . . . senseless; in the courage and undaunted spirit with which the heroes faced any opponent. . . . [However, Homer's] gods . . . could not con- tinue long to be adequate . . . . They were unable to satisfy people who were thinking soberly of right and wrong, who were using their critical powers to specu- late about the universe. . . . [The Greeks] began to ask for a loftier Zeus . . . one who cared for all, not only, as in the Iliad , for the great and powerful. So in a passage . . . [from] the Odyssey he has become the protector of the poor and helpless. . . . The peasant-poet Hesiod . . . placed justice in Olympus as Zeus' companion: "Fishes and beast and fowls . . . devour one another. But to men [sic] Zeus has given justice. Beside Zeus . . . , Justice has her seat."6 The history of the West and elsewhere features the development of claims and rights that move from the few to the many. Western Civiliza- tion is characterized by insistencies and struggles aimed at the inclusion of the poor, workers, various nationalities and races, women, children, the handicapped et al. who had not benefited previously from member- ships in the philosophical, political, economic, cultural, and educational contexts of their societies. We know that the ancient Greeks did not in- clude women, "barbarians," slaves, or foreigners as citizens of the polis. Today, the idea of democracy is characterized by the formal inclusion of one and all under the protection of the law and its government. This unsteady march toward inclusion was neither inevitable nor peaceful. Some postmodernist critiques argued that the whole of Western Civilization represents little more than hypocrisy and injustice because of so-called universal claims made by a select few for their own advantage- from the ancient Greeks to the present.7 This book represents a more generous, although still critical, reading of Western Civilization. My generosity of interpretation is dependent on the analysis of ancient Greek life provided by scholars such as Ellen Meiksins Wood. I draw from her work in order to understand that the potential and reality for what contemporary rationalists and democrats favor can be found in the an- cient polis called Athens. The connection between widespread rational capacities and abilities, and the struggle for bona fide democracy, social justice, and respect for authentic diversity among human beings are high- lighted in this book. Wood argued that it was within the Greek polis, especially Athens, where free labor was invented. Free laborers toiled in a world where much of the work was done by slaves. In Wood's view many political and cultural developments which occurred in Athens were af-</page><page sequence="5">Introduction 5 fected by conflicts between peasant-democrats and those who sought to keep power and riches for the "well-born." She pointed out that "no- where [up to that time] . . . was the . . . division between appropriat- ing and producing classes [rulers and workers], a tension . . . between citizens who had an interest in restoring an aristocratic monopoly of po- litical status and those who . . . [resisted] it, a division between citizens for whom the state would serve as a means of appropriation and those for whom it served as a protection from exploitation [as distinct as in Ath- ens]. . . . This opposition is nowhere more visible than in the classics of Greek philosophy!:] . . . the division between rulers and producers is the fundamental principle of Plato's philosophy, not just his political thought but his epistemology [or, theory of knowledge]."8 Joel Spring reinforced Wood's claim that the ancient Greeks argued about who possessed- and who did not possess- the cognitive abilities necessary for citizenship and self-government. Those who believed that intellectual ability was not widespread in the population expected that those who were neither bright, nor educable, should serve those who allegedly were. Spring reminded us of the "myth of the metals," through which Socrates argued that people were mixtures of gold, silver, and brass. "Those most fit to rule were [said to be] composed primarily of gold and therefore were the most precious. The guardian soldiers were composed primarily of silver, while farmers [peasants] and workers were composed of iron and brass. ... If people believe . . . [this myth], then they believe a person's place in society is the result of inherent qualities .... One could argue that intelligence tests served the same function in the early twentieth century. . . . People might . . . accept their lowly place in society because of a low score .... Socrates argues that gold par- ents will tend to beget gold children . . . [and so on]. However, Socrates maintains . . . [also that] some children of gold parents will be born brass, and some children of brass parents will be gold. When this occurs, children who are unlike their parents are to be placed in their proper social class. As stated in [Plato's] . . . Republic , an important role of the educational system is the determination [i.e., selecting and sorting] of the mixture of metals within each child. . . . There should be a determina- tion of who should be placed among the farmers and workers and who should be educated [for political and economic power]."9 Wood confirmed Spring's critique of intellectual and political stratification favored by some Athenian philosophers. It is important in the classic arguments of this polis and time that we in the West have sought to clarify our own posi- tions. Western philosophy can be characterized as playing with cards</page><page sequence="6">6 Introduction dealt to those of us who came after Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. In Wood's view, the division of labor between rulers and producers is what the idea of justice is based on in the Republic . This division is central to Plato's epistemologa The cognitive ability to recognize and understand what is essential, universal, most real and true is assigned to the gold metālists; the common folk are portrayed as those who can understand only appearances and particulars. This head-hand divide continues to shape the harmful educational stratification in the West.10 The question of who should have political rights, as well as the justifi- cation for it, has been raised and fought over throughout our history. The expansion of citizen's rights and greater inclusion has been among the most important and progressive human achievements. It is well to re- member Wood's insistence on civic status, especially in view of the cur- rent attacks on citizens' rights in the effort to make everyone live by market outcomes alone. "The civic status of the Athenian citizen was a valuable asset which had direct economic implications. Political equality not only coexisted with but substantially modified socio-economic inequal- ity, and democracy was more substantive than [merelyl 'formal'. . . . Citizenship had profound consequences for peasants and craftsmen; and ... a change in the . . . [legal] status of slaves . . . and, women would have transformed the society entirely."11 The critique of ancient classical Greek thought is not intended to mini- mize its importance.12 A description of this intellectual and social achieve- ment follows. It may be an exaggeration to claim, as Edith Hamilton did, that "in a world where the irrational had played the chief role . . . [the Greeks] came forward as the protagonists of the mind."13 Their ancient but extant achievement provides the necessary starting point for our philo- sophical scaffolding as well as the blueprint guiding the main construc- tion. I have chosen a book published in 1957, one of a kind that used to be called a classic in its field, because it assists in portraying a succinct, fair, and honorific account of the remarkable foundational contributions made by the ancient Greeks. One could easily criticize C.M. Bowra's celebratory account through deconstructing the text by way of multiple readings that enjoy the advantage of retrospect; however, it is important to learn about the intellectual glory that was Greece in order to begin the philosophical scaffolding for the construction of critical democratic edu- cation. I shall be as critical and iconoclastic as need be during the course of this book. Bowra addressed the place of reason in Greek thought by pointing out how in the preclassical, i.e., archaic, period the Greeks expressed their</page><page sequence="7">Introduction 7 most significant and profound beliefs via poetry- reinforced by sculpture and painting. By the sixth century B.C., the desire to understand things more precisely and completely led to the development of rational dis- course and to attempts to establish principles and rule-governed explana- tions of human and social phenomena. They wanted to move beyond the whims of mythological gods as explanations for the complexities, dan- gers, and possibilities facing them. Bertrand Russell said, "philosophy, as distinct from theology, began in Greece in the sixth century . . .; [fur- thermore, philosophy can] teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation."14 Bowra informed us that devel- opments in Greek social, economic, and political life fostered this new spirit of inquiry into the visible world; it assumed three forms: mathemat- ics, philosophy, and natural science. Like mathematics, philosophy was an attempt to find realities behind phenomena and/or appearances. The Greek inquirers wished to learn about the origin and nature of things. Bowra offers us this insight: In their desire to find some universal principieis], they assumed as religious think- ers did, the existence of a cosmic order. . . . Even if they could not finally unravel what laws governed phenomena, they could at least claim that such laws existed. . . . The first glimmerings of . . . [natural laws] were . . . derived from [assumed] divine laws .... These branches of inquiry all presuppose that it is both possible and proper for man [sic] to discover the truth about the nature of things. . . . Solon [Athenian lawmaker] . . . follows a[n] ascending scale from utter ignorance to reasonable expectation. . . . [Human beings] may of course make mistakes . . . but [we] do not work in utter ignorance. . . . [Al- though] men cannot hope for certainty, they can make good surmises.15 These Greeks did not claim omniscience, which was reserved for the deities. They developed confidence that revelation could be assisted by and/or replaced by a pursuit of truth through rational inquiry. The old view was superseded by the conviction that we could find truth for ourselves. It is important to realize that Greek philosophers tried to understand the world as a whole. It will become apparent later in this work that such a view is currently seriously attacked by some postmodernist thinkers. We are in debt to our intellectual ancestors for establishing certain central and perennial philosophical concerns, such as the distinctions between one and many, knowledge and opinion, reality and appearance, being and not-being, form and matter, universais and particulars, etc. Bowra tells us, "in making such distinctions the Greeks tried to solve the discord between the infinite multiplicity and variety of phenomena and the need</page><page sequence="8">8 Introduction for some permanent reality behind them .... The strength of Greek philosophy lies ... in its assumption that there is no problem which cannot be solved by hard and careful thought. It assumes that words are instruments of thought."16 Greek geographers and historians chose prose rather than poetry to communicate their findings, in part because they were convinced that it better suited the necessary qualities of detach- ment, tenacious labor, and the ability to sift evidence that characterized secular inquiry. The historian Thucydides was concerned with human action rather than supernatural forces. Although Greek science and philosophy began as allies of religion, certain issues and inquiries made the incompatibilities between secular thought and religious revelation obvious. This occurred again in Europe during the fourteenth century, A.D., when the reappearance of Greek reason proved to be incompatible with certain religious claims to knowl- edge and truth. The conflict between science and religion was comple- mented by another; between science and philosophy. Greek science de- pended upon the human senses; the philosophers did not trust the senses as a sure basis for knowledge. This great cleavage lives on in our history. Thomas Aquinas tried to create a synthesis/harmony between the claims of reason and faith in the thirteenth century, A.D. Plato attempted to find a solution to the tensions between science and philosophy during the fourth century, B.C. Considering the great importance of Greek philoso- phy and its giant figure, Plato, it is worth reading Bowra on the suggested Platonic cure: Reality for him consists of ideal Forms, which are at once logical universais [time- less and applicable everywhere], capable of being understood, and particulars [imperfect representations of these Forms]. To establish his Forms he appealed ... to religion, and argued that we know them through recollection from a former existence. This might mean . . . that our knowledge of them is innate . . . [moreover,] it is not derived from the senses. Though this impressive system removed [for some] doubts about the possibility of knowledge, it dealt a cruel blow to science. For it meant that observation and experiment gave . . . [way] to a priori reasoning. Plato . . . was so possessed by the notion that the universe is rational that he thought it possible to dictate its structure from his own concep- tion of . . . how the creator ought to have made it. In his search for certainty he failed to allow that on many matters we can hope for no more than a reasonable opinion and that this may be more valuable than any dogmatic assertion.17 We will look carefully at the quest for certainty in chapter two. Bowra recognized the greatness of Plato, as anyone who takes the history of ideas seriously surely must. It is plausible to argue that Plato's answers given to queries about the nature of reality and knowledge have</page><page sequence="9">Introduction 9 played on the central stage longer than any others. These answers have won the greatest historical agreement although this theory has been un- der assault during the last two hundred years, especially in these postmodernist times. Aristotle's encyclopedic labor aimed at synthesizing the whole of knowledge as it was during his life and made great contribu- tions to metaphysics, logic, biology, ethics, and politics. Bowra suggests that "through this double [Plato and Aristotle] achievement the fourth century has a place of high honour in the history of human thought . . . neither in Athens nor elsewhere in Greece did these . . . [achievements! fully compensate for what had been lost."18 What had been lost was the earlier openness between the human mind and material phenomena; there is the condemnation of democracy by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle- a condemnation of common persons as laborers, i.e., in their brass roles. Even the very limited democracy of Periclean Athens was rejected, i.e., its fundamental assumption that its citizens could be trusted to decide on the factors and circumstances that affected their lives. Superstition and rule by the powerful again engulfed the Greek world.19 Still the Greek achievement, epitomized by the myth of Prometheus (who allegedly stole fire from the gods for human benefit but was pun- ished by the deities), continues to teach us about the arts of life and helps us free ourselves from confusion and ignorance. The Greeks were aware of their humble beginnings; many of them saw this as a summons- a possibility at least- to grasp for unrealized potentials and accomplishments. Human beings were seen as creatures in which intelligence and emotions work together to develop aretê (virtue, goodness, the quality of good citizenship) from inborn capacities, as far as possible. During the fifth century, B.C., this development was seen as operating in the sociopolitical context- the polis- which is a much different arena than the contempo- rary market, characterized by a race for material rewards.20 People were considered social beings who, through political interaction with others in the polis, might rise above the animals and one's mere potential; this vision prevailed instead of one that portrayed men and women as being alone in the wilderness. Some religionists view the city as unholy, making it necessary to go off on one's own to find identity and/or salvation. The unique achievement of the classical Greeks was their recognition that although they were humans rather than gods, they were content and proud of their placement. The Greeks, at their secular best, sought to find their own excellence. By the fourth century, B.C., the notion of human beings able to almost reach beyond human placement began to give way to the construction of barriers between human beings on the ground and the increasingly rarefied, detached, but self-contained, realm of the tran-</page><page sequence="10">10 Introduction scendental. Bowra explains, by making the transcendental realm and its deities completely separate from the lived experiences of ordinary human beings, the earlier attempt to emulate the (formerly) familiar and anthro- pomorphic deities became impossible. "In different ways the great think- ers helped break up the universe in which the Greeks had enjoyed [for- merly! the illumination of a lower order of things by a higher [one] and had felt that there was . . . hope of transcending their . . . limitations in some unforeseen direction. It emphasized that the ordinary . . . [per- son] must rely on his own experience .... Instead of reinforcing and extending the . . . [range] of human activities, the new speculations confined them to a man-centered world and destroyed the consciousness of a superior dimension which had given a special splendour to the [clas- sical] Greek vision of experience."21 The tension between limitations and the potential to break beyond them provided the progressive dynamism of classical Greece. Educators and citizens struggle with the problems and possibilities of human voli- tion (or agency) as it bumps up against limitations and structure. Perhaps the Greeks were among the first to help us understand that it is the struggle to rise above our fears, limitations, temptations, fatigue, lack of imagina- tion, and unethical tendencies that is most important and admirable. Consider the following passage from Nikos Kazantzakis (1885-1957), a Greek writer born in Crete. He was writing to his honorary grandfather, the great painter called El Greco (1541-1614), also a Greek from Crete. Kazantzakis' words represent well the tension which Bowra and I write about. This creative tension did not entirely expire during the Greek fourth century, B.C. Our Center, grandfather, the center which swept the visible world into its whirl and fought to elevate it to the upper level of valor and responsibility, was the battle with God. Which God? The fierce summit of man's [sic] soul, the summit which we are ceaselessly about to attain and which ceaselessly jumps to its feet and climbs still higher. . . . That is why the whole of our lives was an ascent grandfather. . . . We set out with many fellow strugglers, many ideas. . . . But as we ascended and as the summit shifted and became more remote, fellow strugglers, ideas, and hopes kept bidding us farewell. . . . They were neither willing nor able to mount higher. We remained alone. . . . We were swayed neither by arrogance nor by the naive certainty that one day the summit would stand still and we would reach it; nor yet, even if we should reach it, by the belief that there on high we would find happiness, salvation, and paradise. We as- cended because the very act of ascending, for us, was happiness, salvation, and paradise.22 Think about how this passage epitomized the sense of tension and struggle that characterized the classical Greeks. They realized that human beings</page><page sequence="11">Introduction 1 1 were both individuals and members of societies which featured certain histories. The possible relevance of these ideas for professional educa- tors-and active citizens- can be answered only by the readers themselves. For those who are reading this book together, it would be easy enough to engage in conversation based upon multiple readings and interpretations of the text. II The interpretation of the classical Greek experience in this book portrays our forebears as having the need, and for a time, the confidence to make sense of their world and their roles in it. It could be plausibly argued that need and confidence helped these ancient people move haltingly and imperfectly to a form of limited participatory democracy in some of their city-states. Democracy, art, architecture, theater, and even the anthropo- morphic Greek religions served to place human beings near the center of things. The considered importance of, and reliance on, reason, are keys to understanding the Greeks' confidence in human beings, our central roles, and especially the ability to see things holistically, as well as in terms of the common good. Although the classical Greeks failed to de- velop a political vision and practice that would allow unity among them- selves, the belief that a big picture existed and could be understood per- sisted throughout Western Civilization. A persistent theme in Western history has been the belief in the possibility of, and the need for, a con- structive process aimed at articulating a notion of the common good. Judeo-Christian religious traditions have contributed to the Greek project of holistic thinking and pro bono publico initiatives. Much of this belief came together in the Roman Empire and lived on in the synthesis called Christianity, as it was shaped in part by its progenitor, Judaism. I think it is warranted to assert that, in spite of grave failures along the way, there has been a historical attempt in Western Civilization to make people at home in their social and physical worlds. These difficult-to- achieve accomplishments were used to further the opportunity for human beings to live more dignified lives- through the expansion and deepening of certain rights and safeguards. I do not suggest a teleological develop- ment, only to indicate certain actions that sought to construct spaces in which people could live more humanely. I remind the reader that I make no claim that the "West is best." I merely want to suggest that the struggle for human dignity (in terms of recognized worth) has been carried on by some of those who have come to live in the West- either because of birth, or as willing/unwilling migrants and/or emigrants. These continuous</page><page sequence="12">12 Introduction struggles for dignity can be characterized roughly by the following land- marks: (1) Religious dignity through the belief in interfering, mostly be- neficent, and anthropomorphic deities. (2) Philosophical dignity via Greek rationalism that insisted on the central place of human beings and their intellectual prowess, an understandable cosmos/universe, Promethean audacity, and the possibility for using this reason and orderliness to con- struct (albeit imperfect) democracies. (3) Political dignity as epitomized by self-government in the polis, Roman republic, Renaissance city-states, the curbing of the monarchies, the rise of constitutional government, and the eruptions of democracy beginning in the late eighteenth century and in- creasingly afterward. (4) The basic and continuing struggle for economic dignity, often stated in terms of citizen and political rights, accentuated in the late-eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries by labor and vari- ous socialist movements whose members insisted that citizens' political rights and dignity were inextricably related to socioeconomic justice. (5) A recognition that the inner life is of great importance and organically re- lated to social life; citizens and workers must be able to enjoy the psycho- logical well-being that is essential to human dignity. It bears repeating that the continuing struggle to achieve human dig- nity and justice has not been linear; there have been regressions, tan- gents, uneven developments, and threats posed by various barbarisms, including the historical repressive reaction by most ruling elites. This dan- gerous situation has not been solved in our time. The struggle must con- tinue although we can see ourselves as part of a long and worthwhile effort. Albert Camus captured the essence of my point in the following passage from his novel, The Plague. Dr. Rieux resolved to compile ... [a] chronicle, so that he should not be one of those who hold their peace but should bear witness in favor of those plague- stricken people; so that some memorial of the injustice and outrage done them might endure; and to state . . . simply what we learn in a time of pestilence: that there are more things to admire in men [and women] than to despise. None the less, he knew that the tale he had to tell could not be one of final victory. It could be only the record of what had to be done, and what assuredly would have to be done again in the never ending fight against terror and its relentless onslaughts, despite their personal afflictions, by all those who, while unable to be saints but refusing to bow down to pestilence, strive their utmost to be healers .... Rieux . . . knew what those jubilant crowds did not know . . . that the plague bacillus never dies . . .; it can lie dormant for years . . . and that perhaps the day would come when ... it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.23</page><page sequence="13">Introduction 13 III What I have presented so far can help the reader to consider some peren- nial intellectual/epistemological dichotomies: (1) certainty-uncertainty; (2) universal-particular; (3) revelation, intuition, mysticism-reason, especially of the secular kind; (4) deductive-inductive; (5) and a dichotomy along a continuum of optimism and pessimism with regard to knowing and the human condition. I have mentioned that I am not implying that dichoto- mous either/or thinking is necessary or advisable. Those who have been and currently are involved in the struggle for human dignity and justice, according to their own interpretations of these terms, are positioned roughly along these continua. We are situated along an epistemological continuum or axis that is anchored at one end by the certainty claimed by revelatory religion and/or idealist philosophy, to realism, pragmatism, existentialism, poststructuralism, constructivism, postmodernism, cynicism, and perhaps nihilism on the other end. These issues are crucially related to the current explosive educational and political debates concerning what it might mean for us to venture from the putative security of hoped-for certainty (often interpreted by our so-called elites and even "betters") to the problematic situation characterized by all persons participating in the construction of educational/political/social/cultural meanings, preferences, and proposed actions. Progressing toward participatory democracy can hopefully increase the chance for social justice and respect for bona fide diversity and human worth. The reader is invited to organize her/his thoughts/beliefs/intellectual positions around the intersecting continua in figure 1. This intellectual work can assist you as you begin to think more sys- tematically and enter into discussions about your preliminary construc- tion of an educational philosophy. For example, the constructor may decide upon a defensible, authoritarian position should s/he believe that absolut- faith/intuition/revelation absolutist situation moral-ethical system ethics secular reason Figure 1</page><page sequence="14">14 Introduction ist knowledge is possible; or, a more uncertain and/or democratic posi- tion may be chosen because of the positioning taken within the intersect- ing continua. Discussion can move easily to initial choices concerning philosophies of education, e.g., essentialism, progressivism, existential- ism, etc.24 Such a discussion will most likely be preliminary at this point because some readers may lack information about philosophies of educa- tion. The knowledgeable teacher and the students can use these prelimi- nary discussions as opportunities for introductory ideas that can be stud- ied in depth later in this book and/or course of study. The student is well advised to think and read about various theories concerning the "nature" of our genus and species, i.e., the "nature" of man-woman. These con- siderations are central to where one is situated on figure 1. Such consider- ations will be revisited throughout this book.25 I have learned that high school, undergraduate, and graduate students come to discussions such as I have proposed in relation to figure 1 with some information and/or fairly well-thought-out views. Students are not "empty vessels" to be filled when it comes to ideas about human nature and our place in the world. I wrote in the introduction to an experimental high school philosophy class during the 1960s, "Through careful critical examination we are trying to evaluate the information and beliefs we have about the universe . . . and the world of human affairs . . . . This . . . understanding can provide a . . . framework in which the ordinary per- son can place [her] his own, more limited conception of the . . . world. . . . Through such an examination and evaluation we may . . . better assess our ideals and aspirations, as well as to understand . . . why we accept them, or whether we ought to do so."26 Suggested Task for the Reader During these times, characterized in part by the seeming inability of many people to adhere to orthodox and/or absolutist positions with regard to ethical/moral problems, how does a teacher-citizen ground her/his edu- cational philosophy and practice so that it is personally meaningful as well as publicly defensible? Prepare a brief written position with which to guide your contribution to discussion of this question. Walter Lippmann's A Preface to Morals (Boston: Beacon Press, 1929), passim, can be used as a tool for laboring at this task. The doing of this specific philosophical task is of central importance to chapter one. John Dewey explained, that from ancient times to the present, human beings have constructed meanings and explanations for themselves in the face of what was and is problematic. This introductory</page><page sequence="15">Introduction 1 5 chapter does not present philosophy as a finished contemporary prod- uct. Readers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with important conversations in the historical discourse called philosophy. The focus is on the construction of one's own blueprints, scaffolding, and building. Teachers and ordinary citizen-workers in a democracy must understand the need to think philosophically in order to deal with the problems and possibilities of intellectual, professional, and overall civic life. This im- perative should become increasingly clear to the reader as s/he reads and studies on. IV In this section the reader is presented with some ideas about philosophy of education and how it can be congruent with the kind of philosophy being praised in this chapter. It is quite a stretch to go from classical Greece and other historical philosophical references to philosophy of edu- cation in the twentieth century. The careful reader- especially when s/he discusses the chapter with others- can make certain connections between then and now, and philosophy and philosophy of education. My sense of philosophy of education is that it should be a broad and deep analysis into schooling-education and how it relates to the larger societies of which they are a part. Max Black wrote the following which has guided my own work in philosophy and education since first reading it in a book written by my teacher. "'All serious discussion of educational problems, no mat- ter how specific, soon lead to consideration of educational aims, and becomes a conversation about the good life, the nature of man [woman], the varieties of experience. But these are the perennial themes of philo- sophical investigation. It might be a hard thing to expect educators to be philosophers, but can they be anything else?"'27 Black's and Wingo's conception of educational philosophy has influenced my own conception of the discourse and field. The first time I articulated the material pre- sented in section IV was in an article published in 1996.28 What I offer for your consideration is not intended to be definitive or official. It is in keep- ing with the thesis of this book; good philosophy of education serves the interests of those who favor education and a society characterized by broad, democratic empowerment, social justice, and respect for bona fide diversity. For a brief history of philosophy of education as a field of study in the United States, see the appendix at the end of the chapter. I present my views on philosophy of education within the context of the social foundations of education. The social foundations are most com-</page><page sequence="16">16 Introduction monly thought of as philosophy/history/sociology of education. Founda- tions inquiry is characterized by the interpretive , normative , and critical perspectives on education. Michael Apple presented us with the follow- ing insight: "The most important things ... we can know about man is what he takes for granted, and the most elemental and important facts about a society are those that are . . . generally regarded as settled." That is, to . . . understand, the activity of men and women of a specific historical period, one must start out by questioning what to them is unquestionable. As Marx would say, one does not accept the . . . participants' own commonsense appraisals of their . . . activi- ties (though these are important . . .); rather, the investigators must situate these activities in a larger arena. ... In fact, if one were to point to one of the most neglected areas of educational scholarship, it would be . . . the critical study of the relationship between ideologies and educational thought and prac- tice, the study of . . . seemingly commonsense assumptions that guide our overly technically minded field. Such critical scholarship would lay bare the political, social, ethical, and economic interests and commitments that are uncritically ac- cepted as "the way life really is" in our day-to-day life as educators.29 Foundational and philosophy of education inquiry must address the knowl- edge, signs, symbols, curriculum, and pedagogy that are taken for granted in our schools. We must figure out how this "taken for grantedness" as- sists some students, and may block the progress of others. Apple ques- tioned the relation between education and power by arguing that schools help reproduce the social and economic stratification of the larger capital- ist-dominated society through the use of a neutral process of instruction and reward. The cultural capital, or advantages, of the middle classes and rich are presented as natural and as though all students have access to it. "Just as our dominant economic institutions are structured so that those who inherit or already have economic capital do better, so too does cul- tural capital act in the same way . . . [because it] is unequally distributed . . . and this is dependent ... on the division of labor and power in the society. 'By selecting for such properties [as "good taste," particular types of prior knowledge, and language usage], schools serve to repro- duce the distribution of power within the society.'"30 Educators must come to grips with underlying problems such as repro- duction of the present societal and school stratification. Teacher educa- tion must make it more possible for undergrads as well as practicing teachers to analyze, understand, and be committed to democracy, equity, diver- sity, a moral economy, and a sociopolitical system in which it is compara- tively safe more often than not to act altruistically. Our educators must be</page><page sequence="17">Introduction 1 7 encouraged to be in touch with the caring and nurturing aspects of their character. They must be offered the commensurate and necessary oppor- tunities to develop their theoretical powers. The relationships between intellect and feeling have been studied throughout history. Many of those who have commented formally upon what they learned have supported positions that call for a balance between the two, there may not be a stark dichotomy between intellect and feeling. Current educational literature is rich in considerations of this historical discussion. I do not see affect and intellect as necessarily dichotomous. This education must be "radical" in the sense of being able to get to the roots of things, in addition to striving to see phenomena holistically. Perhaps, most important of all, teachers must see themselves as workers who are part of the vast majority of citizens . . . who are . . . [also] classed workers .... This class-consciousness must be . . . part of the complexity that makes up other . . . [identities] such as race, ethnicity . . . and gender. It is as class- conscious workers that teachers should enter into broad umbrella-coalitions with other class-conscious workers. This strategy will provide the best chance to alter the conflicting imperatives [of capitalism and democracy upon the schools] in favor of [the latter]. . . . Public K-12 schools can become sites where the demo- cratic imperative prevails [but] only when synchronized action takes place in schools and elsewhere and especially in the capitalist-dominated economy and . . . [na- tional government].31 Suggested Task for the Reader It has been argued that the Kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) public schools in the United States historically have been subject to the incom- patible imperatives of the capitalist economy and of democracy- con- ceived of in its broad sense. The capitalist imperative is said to demand competent, but not necessarily critical workers, whereas democracy re- quires critical, broadly educated (rather than just trained), and culturally enriched citizen-workers, persons who have the ability to analyze the so- cioeconomic and political systems in which they live. Explain how a K-12 teacher might find it difficult to satisfy both imperatives. It might be useful to focus on the difficulties posed by the need for teachers to select and sort their students according to so-called objective criteria which histori- cally arranges students along an A-F continuum, and being committed to educating all of the students for mastery of what is considered to be of crucial importance to successful democratic citizen empowerment. Does democracy require rank ordering, or is it the economy that places the pressure on teachers to do so?</page><page sequence="18">18 Introduction Maxine Greene claimed that it is "important for teacher education to stimulate critique- not solely of the constructs used to interpret and direct the educational process itself, but of the [academic! discipline or the sub- ject matters. Without such critique, the disciplines are likely to be used for domination, for fixing the vision of young people on the reality others have named."32 Greene asserted that "what has so long been treated as unquestionable must be questioned from a human vantage point and on the ground of shared ethical concerns. Teacher educators must ask them- selves whether this kind of questioning can occur in teachers' colleges and schools."33 She is not naive enough to think that teacher education can change the social order without the help of allies. She refers to Albert Camus's character called Tarrou (in The Plague ): "There are pestilences, and there are victims . . . and it is up to us not to join forces with pestilences.'"34 Although life is characterized by great complexities that surely defy simplistic portrayals of right or wrong, it is possible to recog- nize rather clear-cut sides in certain conflicts. Camus used the metaphor of the plague to represent the social-ethical crisis that threatened to over- come Europe, especially during the 1930s. William Leiss et al. have written about how good teachers must com- bat cynicism. They define cynicism as a way of thinking that identifies truth with what exists; focusing on the parts rather than the whole; refus- ing to consider alternatives to established (constructed) reality; interpret- ing reason as the mere manipulation of so-called facts; and failing "to judge established conditions in the light of . . . existing possibilities for . . . [overcoming] these conditions."35 Marcuse spoke of "negative think- ing" and he viewed it as central to critical thinking itself. Negation seeks to counter the tendency to accept the given/"what isVso-called estab- lished facts as the whole of reality. "Negative thinking" seeks to under- mine self-contentment and what is called common sense. Critical think- ing and/or theory insist that we judge the so-called facts, acceptable practices, and institutions of any constructed society by the possibilities for their replacement. Critical theory insists that we endeavor to under- stand the historical causes that have made possible a particular status quo. Marcuse was a professor of philosophy. His writing and teaching practice are useful to our consideration of educational philosophy, as well as its relevance for teacher education- and K-12 teaching. Marcuses work can remind us that teaching and learning need not always reinforce dominant social relations or reproductive schooling practices. In agree- ment with the material presented in this chapter, Leiss et al. tell us Marcuse believed that "in its origins and intentions knowledge (in the strictest sense:</page><page sequence="19">Introduction 19 philosophy) was highly subversive of . . . established values and institu- tions."36 This subversion is neither capricious nor arbitrary. It is an activ- ity that is necessary if we are to shape our existence in accordance with our rational capacities. For Marcuse, knowledge is inextricably part of the human attempt to create free and rational lives.37 One does not have to be an advocate of critical theory in order to do philosophy of education well. Many other philosophical discourses con- cerned with school and society are also committed to viewing inquiry as subversive of any unjust, nonrational status quo that is unable to with- stand public scrutiny. In 1929 John Dewey wrote in The Quest for Cer- tainty that, although various theories of knowledge (epistemology) differ from one another, their adherents share a good deal in common. In Dewey's view, Western philosophies such as idealism, realism, and their variations subscribe to the notion that reality is antecedent to the search for it, i.e., inquiry is mainly about getting right with what is, or established reality. He argued that scientific inquiry demonstrates that a belief in the inherent properties of the real is a survival of an old metaphysics; to know "reality" means that the inquirer changes what is studied as a result of inquiry itself. It is best to read Dewey's own words as he argues against the old metaphysics. The . . . difference between the attitude which accepts the objects of percep- tion, use and enjoyment as final . . . and that which takes them as starting points for reflection and investigation . . . marks a revolution in the . . . spirit of life, in the entire attitude taken toward whatever is found in existence. When the things which exist around us . . . are regarded as interrogations for which an answer must be sought . . . nature as it already exists ceases to be something which must be accepted and submitted to . . . just as it is. It is now something to be modified, to be intentionally controlled. It is material to act upon so as to transform it into new objects which better answer our needs. Nature [and society] as it exists at any particular time is a challenge, rather than a completion.38 Dewey, like Marcuse, suggested that we can and should refuse to accept a punishing physical "reality" and/or unjust social one. We must and can transform it through rational, solidaristic, human effort. Dewey's intellectual radicalism went beyond his place in the liberal political contexts of his time. He maintained that the most important job for philosophers is to "search out and disclose obstructions; to criticize habits of mind; to focus reflection upon needs congruous with present life; to interpret the conclusions of science with respect to their conse- quences for our beliefs about purposes and values in all phases of life . . . . [Because] the development of a system of thought capable of giving this</page><page sequence="20">20 Introduction service is a difficult undertaking; it can proceed only slowly and through cooperative effort."39 The young Dewey saw science as a method of pub- lic inquiry and decision making that was a necessary alternative to arbi- trariness, obscurantism, superstition, and other flawed processes. As he matured, he began to broaden his idea of scientific inquiry to include the many people who neither work in laboratories nor believe that exact knowl- edge can be had about human beings and our society in the same way that quasi-certainty may be had about non-human phenomena. The ma- ture Dewey moved beyond this "positivism" of his youth and pointed out that "the moral prophets had always been artists. ... All poetry and art set . . . standards by which to compare the everyday existence that surrounds us against the criterion which speaks of potential. What a soci- ety .. . will desire or think to be good, will ... be taught by . . . poets, who communicate most deeply about what experience should be. Art has been the means of keeping alive the sense of purpose that out- runs evidence and of meanings which rise above banal habits."40 Dewey had always known that the scientific method permits only a pursuit of comparative meaning, rather than achieving the exact knowledge of the immutable. He wrote in 1948, "the borderline between what is called hypotheses in science and what is called speculation (usually in a tone of disparagement) in philosophy is thin and shadowy at the time of initiation of new movements- those placed in contrast with 'technical application . . . ' such as take place . . . after a new and revolutionary outlook has managed to win acceptance."41 Chapter four will provide further analysis of Dewey's important contributions to education for democratic empowerment. In an effort to continue the presentation of ideas about philosophy of education that are congruent with the kind of philosophy being honored in this chapter, I will turn to various editorial introductions I have written between 1989-96 in the published proceeding of the Ohio Valley Phi- losophy of Education Society. I draw from this editorial-scholarly writing as a sample of work that can support the philosophical scaffolding for the construction of critical democratic education. If you are not familiar with philosophy of education discourse, you should not be concerned if ques- tions arise that may require discussion in order to answer them. The same is true with regard to words, concepts, and ideas that may be unfamiliar. The reader is best served by a holistic contextual approach to studying what is to be presented. Further reading, reflection on it, making connec- tions with what is already known well, and discussion among readers will help in the effort to make what follows meaningful. Come and look into the window that reveals some of what contemporary philosophers of</page><page sequence="21">Introduction 21 education talk about, as well as some examples of how it can be done. The following is mostly paraphrasing from the editorial introductions I have written, whose original purpose was assisting the readers of the proceedings-called Philosophical Studies in Education- to have a critical overview of the various published papers that comprise the proceedings. The names of the various authors are not included in my critical over- view; one can refer to the published proceedings for this information. For the 1989 publication I emphasized that philosophy of education must obviously attempt to connect theory to the problems and possibili- ties of education and schooling. In fact, the field must serve its own pro- fessorial members, doctoral candidates, potential professional (pre- service) teachers, practicing educational professionals, and ordinary citizens. (See the last paragraph in the appendix at chapter's end for an amplification of the first four points in the preceding sentence.) Scholarly competence is necessary. This accomplishment must be relevant to great issues confronting educators and citizens in the institutional school, the broader educational communities, and the larger society itself. This means that philosophers of education must address themselves to questions of fairness and justice for the old and new persons/groups who have been labeled as minorities and/or marginal. Serious attempts to understand the lived experiences of those who have only recently "found their voices" is of crucial importance to the work we do as teachers, scholars, and citizens. Our field's historical focus on epistemology has allowed us to make a strong case for a pedagogy that does not treat students as con- tainers to be filled up with school knowledge dispensed by teachers. See- ing and treating the student as capable of proactive behavior- one who already knows a good deal about many things even before coming to school- allows us to practice a pedagogy that values many different people who, and groups which, comprise our heterogeneous society. Such an epistemology, pedagogy, and liberatory curriculum are central to forward- ing the project of social class, racial/ethnic, gender, and sexual-orienta- tion justice. Philosophers of education have helped clarify the difficult problems inherent to pluralism and tolerance for those marginalized as "other." In the absence of agreed upon universais, does it follow that each and everything is as worthy of support as everything else? Must we con- struct plausible and warranted criteria to help us choose among compet- ing claims- even though we cannot be certain? Diversity for its own sake may not be warranted after one critically examines her/his core values, and the beliefs and practices of others. This examination may be espe- cially important in these times when increasingly large numbers of people</page><page sequence="22">22 Introduction worldwide are bombarded by advertising and products, in a manner that suggests consumer choices are tantamount to reflective citizen choices about politics, justice, and other more important issues than new-and- improved gadgets in all their diverse and various forms. To live without certainty and yet not be paralyzed by hesitation or inaction has never been easy. The recent past has featured powerful reac- tionary forces throughout the world that have contested fiercely the posi- tions of brave people who have not insisted on being in possession of absolute truth. There have occurred many quests for certainty as our lives have been buffeted by forces that make it difficult to know old signposts and maps. In the United States we have experienced a seemingly orches- trated call for a return to the so-called basics in schooling; a restoration of an essentialist curriculum; the replacement of heuristic pedagogy by au- thoritarian didactics; the enlistment of our youth into the service of busi- ness and industry through a renewed emphasis on various forms of repro- ductive vocationalism; the restructuring of schooling for leadership roles to the daughters and sons of the affluent and powerful; and the attempted abandonment of public schooling as a place where the harshness of the market has been somewhat alleviated for more than a few students, many who have learned how to become critical citizens with skills to make the promise of democracy, social justice, and respect for bona fide diversity possible. It is not yet decided whether a return to the unhappy quest for certainty will be successful, or if those who realize the injustice of estab- lishing an orthodoxy based on alleged certainties for one and all will prevail. We shall all play roles in determining whether it is possible to live with uncertainty, hypotheses, warranted assertibility, and abundant choices, while still being committed to constructing a common public place where differences need not be considered handicaps. Can educa- tion and politics that respect our considerably varied views be successful in ultimately developing a socioeconomic and cultural space in which persons can become more human, and where it will be safer to act altruistically? In the 1991 editorial introduction to Philosophical Studies in Educa- tion, I emphasized that contributors to the proceedings insisted that our field be committed to concerns of teachers and laypersons. Philosophers of education were not cautioned to assume that we are working in univer- sally applicable frameworks. We must realize that understanding is an outcome of activities, rather than the grasping of timeless realities. As I argued earlier in this chapter, inquirers alter that which is studied, as well as ourselves. We conduct inquiry in a complex cultural life that is interac- tive and dialogic. Classed, raced, and gendered actors create knowledge</page><page sequence="23">Introduction 23 as we interact and attempt to understand our world, and sometimes, change it. The attempt by some philosophers of education to establish a value- free method of inquiry has been judged to have been a failure. The at- tempt by British philosophers of education et al. to develop an "objective" point of reference has been criticized by those who are convinced that education must be analyzed within the specific contexts in which they occur. The persistence of social class, racial, ethnic, gender, national, religious, and other differences make it difficult, if not impossible, to es- tablish convincing value-free methods of inquiry. This does not mean that human intelligence is incapable of understanding complex issues con- cerning school and/or society. Certain values can be evaluated as being better than others. But, this must be accomplished by convincing argu- mentation within the hurly-burly of lived experience. An example of this kind of argument appears in the 1991 proceed- ings. An insightful, easily understood, and ethically grounded argument favoring equal opportunities in our school and society is effective in coun- tering the recent calls for retreat from promises made for social, racial, and gender justice in the United States. Drawing on the work of philoso- pher John Rawls, this particular contributor reminds us that in all too many cases reward and/or punishment is experienced by students and adults because of genetic inheritance, socioeconomic conditions, luck, and systematic bias and discrimination. Even after one becomes aware of the uneven playing field, concerned people must decide to act in order to alter this lack of fairness and justice. Rawls challenges us to see the pos- sible connections between equal opportunities and more roughly equal outcomes! Otherwise, we must reconsider our egalitarian rhetoric. Another contributing philosopher of education provides an analysis of how the metaphor of vision-as-knowledge has dominated Western episte- mology. Plato is blamed for arguing that true knowledge, based on clear vision, is about "out there" universal things. This model has permitted historically powerful men and groups of them to dominate others- includ- ing women. The spectators were unequally able to perceive and under- stand the objectivity and truth represented in the universal concepts. A metaphor of voice is suggested as a replacement for one of vision, be- cause the former implies that knowledge emerges out of conversations among a large representation of discussants. Democracy is favored over the antidemocracy of Plato. The voice epistemological metaphor is rec- ommended for education that is democratically empowering, committed to social justice, and based on diverse speakers. Paulo Freire helped us</page><page sequence="24">24 Introduction understand that conversations among many people lead to an emerging developmental way of knowing that is central to real participatory democ- racy. Some multiculturalists have insisted that members of various minor- ity groups seem to leam best within pedagogy based on the voice metaphor. Other philosophers of education expressed support of pluralism and varied voices in the 1991 proceedings. In a paper arguing that it is defen- sible to teach about religions in schools- as contrasted to proselytizing for a particular religion- the author insists that students should be able to learn about more and varied religious viewpoints, beyond the so-called "major" ones. Educators are urged to discuss religious viewpoints in a community-like atmosphere characterized by civility; this condition helps make it possible for discussants to enter into a covenant of respect for each others' differences. This achievement can make possible the attain- ment of some forms of unity based on freely articulated self-definitions rather than on coercion. Many other contributors to this proceedings addressed the problem of how to arrive at some consensus on important issues of school and society while insuring that agreement was freely achieved. One interesting point of view expressed in 1991 claimed that good teachers must reconceptualize teaching as interactive collégial participa- tion, a process in which the student gradually assumes a greater partici- patory role. The student viewed as initially part of the audience at a per- formance gradually comes on the stage to join the play/discourse. This teacher-as-performer model can be used to invite the student audience into the conversations that they must master in order to have voice in a plural democratic society. There must be room for all on the stage during the last act of the play. The 1993 proceedings included some of the following ideas in phi- losophy of education. The presidential address forwarded the thesis that what has been called gossip was demeaned because it was used to de- scribe women's talk. The society's president argued that in male-domi- nated Western culture, certain kinds of talk were categorized as less valid and important. It kept women and other subaltern people quiet. Gossip was categorized as outside of public discourse by male power in order to deprive women of citizen rights. Feminists argued that gossip is a counter- discourse that should be recognized in an expanded public sphere. When powerful men talk about their work and concerns, it is not called gossip. The historical dichotomy that kept most women in the private sphere (raising children, laboring in the kitchen, etc.) while reserving the public sphere to men (bourgeois and citizen) was analyzed and deconstructed by</page><page sequence="25">Introduction 25 the philosopher of education who gave the presidential address. In the editorial introduction to these proceedings, I added that critical theorists such as Herbert Marcuse strengthen the thesis of the presidential address by asserting that without fantasy, philosophy remains in the grip of an unrationalized and possibly unjust past and present. Fantasy as another counterdiscourse frees imagination to take us beyond the given, the so- called real, or, the "what is." The naming of things that are absent in the present situation helps break the spell of things that are in place. Both feminist thought and critical theory have opened up spaces in which oppositionalist and reformist persons, ideas, and groups can maneuver. The contemporary emphasis on viewing social class, race/ethnicity, and gender (as well as sexual orientation) identities as importantly interactive provides opportunities for broad-based coalitions aimed at advancing social class, racial, gender, and sexual justice. The keynote address published in the 1993 proceedings dealt with the challenge posed by multicultural realities in terms of whether we are ca- pable of living together safely and justly in a world of differences. This contribution included expanding the concept of multiculturalism to the formerly colonized areas in the Caribbean and Latin America. The reader was presented with literature that may not have been known to her/him previously. For example, Wilson Harris's The Palace of the Peacock en- courages us to take seriously the oppressed people's myths as statements against colonial domination. Giving voice to such viewpoints is similar to a reconsideration of gossip and fantasy as honorable discourses. The keynote address urged teachers and students to engage in the rewritings of the so-called official accounts of reality and value that have been pre- sented by those with power- at the expense of those without it. Another contributor to the 1993 proceedings made a case for social foundations of education, and especially philosophy of education, to be among the vanguard in the analyses of the social conditions of schooling. These discourses have much to offer the study of pluralism and multicultural education. Interpretive, normative, and critical skills are of the greatest importance to those of us who seek to understand how to balance the wonderful differences among us with the need for some democratically constructed agreements on common purposes and actions. We are re- minded by a following contribution that because of our personal and local situatedness, it is difficult to see things holistically. Localized positionality and everyday activities occur within a context of "chaos." All too many philosophers in the past have tried to deny this condition and have con- structed safe, but false, big-picture explanations in order to ameliorate</page><page sequence="26">26 Introduction their fears. Ernest Hemingway's short story, "A Clean Well-Lighted Place," provides a good analysis of actions taken by one who is afraid of chaos; in this case the dark. We should not be hesitant to use our own critically reflected upon autobiographies in order to establish our embeddedness or, view from somewhere, so that reaching out and making common cause with progressive allies is more possible. Another fine contribution explained how quantum physicists have taught us that what we observe is not nature itself, but only nature as exposed by our method of inquiry. The observer is dependent on her/his position in time and space. Quantum, unlike Newtonian, physics compels us to con- sider our cognitive/epistemological/theoretical assumptions in limited terms. Newtonian physicists may have shrouded their assumptions from their own critical evaluation by assuming the assumptions were objective and universally applicable. The next contributor gave us a bit more. The argument was made that master narratives are not objectively or universally true; they are con- structed by those with power to impose their views on others. These master, or official, stories are often seen as merely myths, misrepresenta- tions, lies, and oppressive to some critics, especially those who may suf- fer personally as a result of the living conditions prevailing because of these controlling narratives. An example presented was the myth of mar- ket logic as related to arguments for abandoning public schools. So-called free-market models have been used to push rival ideas to the margins. The free-market model and discourse must be critiqued so that they no longer appear as part of the very nature of things, i.e., a natural law. This constructed myth should stand revealed as a partisan political view that favors certain people while ignoring and/or punishing others. We are encouraged by yet another contributing philosopher of education to work toward democratically constructed "universais," albeit ones that will need continuous reconstruction. Although to be human is to err, it may still be possible to argue that a secular basis for democratically developed ethics and morality is a realistic and necessary task. Warranted assertibility is not truth; it is superior to "everyone's opinion is as good as any other." Let us continue to look through the window provided by paraphrasings from the editorial introductions, this time from 1994. The conference theme from which these proceedings derived was called "Globalism, Postmodernism, the Politics of Identity, and the Problems-possibilities for Democratic/educational Coalitions." The call for papers made it clear that the Ohio Valley Philosophy of Education Society wanted to include as many and varied papers as possible. It was specifically stated in the call</page><page sequence="27">Introduction 27 for submissions that "proposals concerning diversity, multi-culturalism, community, social class, feminist . . . issues, as well as democracy . . . would all fit under the general umbrella theme." I served as president of the Society in 1994. My presidential address was commented on by a colleague, Kevin McDonough. I wrote the rest of the editorial introduc- tion, "Perennial Problems of Philosophy and Education Played Upon an End of the Millennium Post Landscape." You are to decide which kind of "post" best describes these times- some would say, "postmodernism." The first paper in the 1994 proceedings spoke to the postmodernist critique of modernist/Enlightenment traditions. Its author worried that such critique destroys the possibility of understanding the world we in- habit. Such cognitive failure makes progressive politics in school and so- ciety meaningless or impossible. The contributor expressed concern about how an emancipatory discourse and action based on the recognition and valuing of human differences could develop also the necessary experi- ences of commonality and unity. In the end, this writer turned to "social dreaming" and "bridges of faith" as ways to activate differentiated people's potential for engaging in a politics of common cause, an activity that might support a pedagogy for democratic empowerment, social justice, and respect for bona fide diversity. I raised the editorial caution that rely- ing on spirituality and faith may be incongruous with the radical, demo- cratic, secular tradition that has importantly driven the broad-based struggles for democracy we have experienced in the modern West. It is well known that reliance on spirituality and faith can result in internecine warfare and obscurantism, as well as the mixture of faith and reason exemplified by struggles led by Mohandas Gandhi and/or Martin Luther King. It is well for philosophers of education to keep in mind the problem articulated by the playwright Bertolt Brecht as he tells of the physicist and astronomer Galileo and his assistant who is a monk. The monk worries aloud about the possible consequences concerning Galileo's "discovery" that ours is a heliocentric universe. The monk realizes that a change from the comforting belief that the earth is the center of the universe will unsettle the lives of ordinary people who labor so hard within a context they have tried to interpret as reasonable and safe. "They have been told that God relies on them and that the pageant of the world has been written around them. ... How could they take it, were I to tell them that they are on a lump of stone ceaselessly spinning in empty space, circling a second-rate star?"42 A philosopher and/or philosopher</page><page sequence="28">28 Introduction of education might retort: "How can you not tell them that such is a possibility." Speaking of a scientific view of the world and its events, it is logical to turn next to contemporary technology and the problems as well as possi- bilities it represents. One of the best contributions to the 1994 proceed- ings analyzes how the hegemony exercised by capitalists, their allies in the governments, and other institutions such as the schools is often expe- rienced as part of technology instead of direct political pressure. For ex- ample, the technology of computerized instruction and tests often serves to continue the polarization of achievement along social class lines. In fact, technology, including in the schools, can conceal the goals and inter- ests of the ruling elites and their agents. This self-interest can be, and often is, built into the design and workings of various machines even before they are assigned to specific tasks. So much for the arguments promoting technology's neutrality. As the contemporary K-12 public schools are susceptible to ever more aggressive attempts by reactionaries to reduce schooling to a mostly reproductive (of existing power, wealth, access, privilege relations) function- including programs to encourage stu- dents to enroll in "tech prep" vocational tracks- the philosophical analy- sis of the partisan nature of educational technology becomes especially relevant. Educators, who are inundated by offers of technological solu- tions to the seemingly intractable teaching and learning problems caused by asymmetrical power relations in our society and schools, can benefit from studying this fine contribution to the 1994 proceedings. This is important when considering the drive to make school kids "computer literate" in the absence of becoming "critically literate." We must position ourselves on the side of the perennial philosophical quest for understand- ing, especially in radically altered socioeconomic and political global sys- tems featuring fantastic electronic media developments. From the analysis of technology and the continuing, vocational repro- ductive function of schooling, the next contributor argued that it would be easier to accept the vocationalization of our public school system if there were good jobs with generous benefits available at the time of graduation. The contributor thinks that the agents of those with the greatest eco- nomic and political power have used the alleged lack of adequate school- ing-training as the main cause of unemployment in the U.S. economy. As a result, one must keep her/his eyes on the capitalist market in order to understand the social and school crisis. Perhaps the central problem is the rationalization of labor (building intelligence into the machine and/or pro- cess) as well as the exportation of all too many jobs abroad to societies</page><page sequence="29">Introduction 29 where workers are virtually unprotected by organized labor and their gov- ernments. Despite the rhetorical cry for higher level skills in the work force, the deskilling of blue, white, and pink collar workers has proceeded along with the global expansion of capitalism. The next contributor argued that teachers-as-intellectuals must be es- pecially aware of power relations that affect school and society. Teachers can and must move beyond the role of clerical workers. Drawing on Paulo Freires work, this philosopher of education insisted that teachers exam- ine the causes of injustice so that it can be understood and overcome. This could clear spaces in which to construct a more just school and society. This paper included a call for the transformation of teacher prepa- ration programs so that they may become "sites for social transforma- tion." My response to this noble call to action argued that such transfor- mation is dependent upon educators being able to obtain massive support from allies outside of their workplace. Such profound change will take a long time to achieve. Those in power would and do fight fiercely to pre- serve the system that works for them. The 1994 proceedings included a panel discussion of the movie, "Forrest Gump." Perhaps this is an indication that philosophers of education are interested in popular culture. Popular cultural forms are ubiquitous as they are driven by commercial imperatives. They have saturated most of the spaces in which we live. Our educational analyses and projects must take popular culture into consideration, otherwise charges of irrelevancy could be made. Philosophers of education can and must help bring rigor and stability to the burgeoning field called cultural studies. Let us conclude our brief encounter with work done in 1994 by phi- losophers of education with Kevin McDonough's comments on my presi- dential address. [Brosio] argues that democratic politics and education can and should develop political and educational practices and institutions that privilege our common identities as citizens and workers, rather than our ethnic, cultural, sexual or other particularistic identities. ... I would like to highlight three central themes in Richard's argument and then . . . indicate one direction his analysis might lead us. First, Richard articulates a wide ranging critique of recent postmodern themes in social, political and educational thought. The thread which ties his multi-fac- eted critique together is the notion that the postmodernist intellectuals have ne- glected to theorize the relation between the cultural issues that preoccupy them and underlying economic and social class factors; consequently, postmodernists have failed to seriously challenge the prodigious power of global capitalism. The point is not, of course, that we should ignore the cultural issues that postmodernists have brought to the forefront of social, and educational, discourse. Rather, Brosio</page><page sequence="30">30 Introduction argues that we need to examine and attempt to understand more adequately the relationship between such issues and bigger, underlying economic forces. This theme is important because it forces us to consider that many postmodernist intellectual concerns provide a feeble response to real educational problems such as the "savage" economic inequalities characterizing modern capitalist society and schools. . . . [The reference here is ... to Jonathan Kozol's Savage In- equalities, New York: Harper Perennial, 1991.] Richard's second central theme develops a critique of what he takes to be post-modernism's political expression- the politics of identity. For Brosio, the politics of identity as it is currently consti- tuted-theoretically by postmodernist intellectuals and concretely in the political arena of capitalist, democratic societies- is a futile response to capitalism's corro- sive influence of established forms of communal identity. At the same time, he understands the potential for the best possible expression of a politics of identity in terms of the need for a robust resistance to capitalist hegemony. The argument here is not that economic causes underlying cultural, gender, sexual or other forms of inequality are genuine while psychological or spiritual ones are false. Rather, the argument is that economic causes are primary, and we need explana- tory frameworks that recognize this in order to be able to understand and con- struct political practices and institutions that will enable subaltern people to actu- ally exercise their capacity to construct and express their particular identities in meaningful ways. Richard's analysis here encourages us to remember that claims by subaltern groups and individuals for recognition are often responses- con- scious or unconscious- to deteriorating material conditions under conditions of modern, global capitalism, rather than to real or perceived psychological insults. Thus, he suggests the appropriate response on the part of a democratic society that values and encourages the vibrant expression of plural identities may not be the mere inclusion of multiple "voices" in a discourse dominated by the unchal- lenged hegemony of capitalism, but rather the radical transformation of capital- ism itself. The third and most fundamental theme develops Richard's argument for broad "rainbow coalitions" focused around common citizen-worker identities. He argues that such coalitions are both possible and necessary in order to achieve the sort of political agency required for democratic, anti-capitalist political and social transformation that enables the celebration and recognition of pluralistic group and individual identities. According to Brosio, the category of citizen-worker (where work is defined broadly to include unpaid labor as well as non-traditional forms of "work", such as the very process of cultural identity formation that characterizes human action) is primary because it represents the necessary plat- form for resisting the capitalist forces that make the process of constructing mean- ingful expressions of cultural, gender, sexual, etc. identity impossible, or at least very difficult, for dispossessed people. Importantly, the construction of common modes of identity around the categories of citizen and worker are not meant to subvert local cultural, gender or other communal identities. Rather, Brosio em- phasizes that the construction of common citizen-worker identities is necessary for permitting our more basic identities to flourish. Having summarized, too briefly, the main features of Brosio's far-reaching essay, it is nevertheless illuminating to consider where his analysis might lead us. Richard's argument for broad political and educational coalitions points toward- but does not answer- at least two im-</page><page sequence="31">Introduction 31 portant educational questions. First, what actual groups and individuals might constitute such coalitions in contemporary democratic political contexts? Sec- ond, what motivational sources might exist, and be developed, to enable diverse groups and individuals to coalesce into broader coalitions? . . . The points [sug- gested] in the preceding paragraph are not intended as a refutation or even a criticism of Richard's argument for broad, democratic coalitions. It merely high- lights the point that such coalitions will not automatically form once people dis- cover and/or construct the common social interests that underlie their diverse identity claims. People who find they share common interests as workers and citizens may and will continue to ask why shared, perhaps even universalistic, considerations of social class should take precedence over particularistic consid- erations of race, ethnicity, gender when these come into conflict in particular cases? Moreover, educators will wonder why they should privilege considerations of social class over other considerations. These questions are beyond the scope of Brosio s essay because they address issues of ethical justification that he is not concerned with in the present context. Nevertheless, they are questions that must be addressed and answered before we can get on with the task of creating a just social and political order that allows and encourages the toleration and mean- ingful celebration of differences. I would argue that Richard Brosio's . . . presi- dential address is important and valuable for educators not only because it forces us to re-examine the important role that socio-economic class plays in democratic politics and education, but because it provokes us to examine the complex dy- namics that must underlie our understanding of, and justification for, a politics and education for the common good in democratic societies.43 Perhaps the reader can better understand what philosophy of education conversations are like after considering Professor McDonough's support- ive but critical response to my work. Finally, we will consider the proceedings from the 1995 annual meet- ing of the Ohio Valley Philosophy of Education Society. My editorial in- troduction was called, "'On the Edge': Warranted Desperation, With a Bit of Class." I pointed out that although there are varied themes and even formats of presentation in the 1995 meeting and its published pro- ceedings, there are topics, concerns, and arguments that are related to one another. These similarities may very well characterize, to some ex- tent, where many philosophers of education "are at" during these times- especially in North America. The works represented in the 1995 pro- ceeding represent the problems and intellectual/structural problems as well as perceived possibilities during these last years of the second millennium. In the editorial response to the 1995 presidential address I draw from Russell Jacoby's work. He stated that in these times not only is the per- sonal life considered (by some) a part of politics- in terms of engagement in struggles to advance one's or a group's goal- but everything is consid-</page><page sequence="32">32 Introduction ered political by those lacking the ability to make fine and necessary dis- tinctions. The failure to distinguish among various public and/or private actions results in the unfortunate position characterized by the following: If everything is political, then no action assumes more significance than any other. "Reinterpreting pop[ularl culture becomes as political as run- ning for office, organizing labor unions, or working on the local school board. The upshot is the politicization of self, language, and knowledge- the immediate domain of the academic. . . . The focus on interper- sonal encounter, however, shifts attention away from [arguably] more important issues, such as the structures of racism or economic injus- tice."44 I use Jacoby to critique the views of some postmodernist thinkers. The philosopher of education who gave the invited address speaks to Jacoby 's point. This address included arguments explaining how femi- nists are correct to avoid concentrating on "grand issues," because not everyone agrees what these are. There are many sites on which to struggle for social and education justice. This contributor reminded us that we must realize that gender is also classed and raced. All too often, spokes- persons for feminist concerns do so from privileged social-class and white positions, whereas solidarity with others who occupy subaltern positions in the ranked order of U.S. society is of utmost importance if significant change is to occur. This address supports my position concerning the central importance of citizen and worker as identities around which to build progressive coalitions of classed, raced, and gendered people. Another contribution to the 1995 proceedings explained the gendered nature of teachers' work, historically and in the United States, as well as in Europe. The public elementary schools featured "moral education" aimed at keeping working-class students in place. The children of the rich and powerful were educated for eventual leadership. Because of the ste- reotypes about women concerning their emotive side rather than ratio- nal/intellectual capacities, the nineteenth and early-twentieth century fea- tured poorly paid women teachers whose task it was to prepare the working class for its eventual role in the stratified capitalist economy, with proper loyalties to the class State. This paper explained that the education of teachers has not been as academically effective as necessary, in part, because teacher preparation programs too often are designed to service the job and credentials market, rather than the imperative of democracy and its need for broadly educated, critical citizens. 1 will examine the final contribution to the 1995 proceedings and bring this section of chapter one to a close. This provocative contribution serves us well as a bridge to the 1995 Ohio Valley Philosophy of Education</page><page sequence="33">Introduction 33 Society meeting which called for papers specifying "how the climate of downsizing, rightsizing, retrenchment ... is affecting philosophers of education." I remind you that the published papers, i.e., Philosophical Studies in Education , are made available after the annual meetings. The following passage is quoted from the 1995 proceeding's editorial introduction as I comment on David Blacker s paper, "Saints, Sinners, Selves: Into Pedagogy's Outer Zone." Blacker begins by telling us . . . that poverty, marginalization, and other forms of social injustice do not, in most cases, give rise to a noble sufferer who is then prompted to act solidaristically and altruistically. He compares the conditions in the Nazi death camps with some facets of situations within more than a few inner cities in this country. Blacker makes a poignant and powerful case for how people who have been under siege as well as subject to violations of their bodies and spirits tend to act: actions which many more fortunate people condemn out of ignorance- if not malice. The author is not afraid to argue that the architects of the new economic world order are importantly responsible for creating the condi- tions wherein too many human beings have been declared superfluous. Zeroing in, Blacker makes clear that ghetto oppression has led to concentration camps before; moreover, these camps became sites for annihilation! Blacker makes pal- pably clear how many of the inner city youths' actions are sensible within the frames of reference they have been structurally bound within. The severity of the problems that David describes makes the conventional, self-serving, mean-spir- ited Rightist explanation of the alleged reasons for ghetto dwellers' behaviors seem like part of the problem. His assessment of the damage done to ghetto youth does not serve to strengthen United Statesian liberal explanations and/or policies either. Courageously, Blacker argues that some of the ghetto youth have been so severely damaged that pedagogy in the "normal" sense is inadequate to the task. He insists that K-12 teachers must become political activists in order to have a chance to help solve the human-created problems of economic superflu- ousness, racism, and forms of malign neglect- as well as malign actions within the free-fire zones of our urban centers. The advocates of better "classroom man- agement" and "harmless innovation" appear to be either fools or knaves when juxtaposed beside David's searing analysis. A sample of Blacker's work which can serve as an inviting coming-attraction reads as follows: "The often slow-moving violence of capitalism and of institutionalized racism does more than cause pain, sadness, and anger. It peels the skin off of live selves, exposing them naked and raw to one another and to a barbed wire world. These selves are forced to contest one another in an almost Hobbesian state of nature, a beeper and uzi-toting war of all against all." . . . Blacker explains how those with power have created a serviceable other, as well as the structural conditions that force the oth^r(s) to fulfill the denigrative stereotype intrinsic to the original construction of this s/he who can be used, abused, and cast outside the protections enjoyed by those who are more fortunate- and often complicitous. Blacker would have us face up to Dewey's challenge that it is irrational to value something, e.g., progressive/ humane/equitable education, while refusing to value means that are necessary to</page><page sequence="34">34 Introduction make such goals possible and concrete. Let us hear the last words from Professor Blacker himself while noticing his emphasis on structure and especially its mean- ing during the end of the second millennium when so many insist that there is no structure, no totalizing logic, and no capitalism. "As the stresses and strains of late capitalism proceed apace, as, for example, the school population is further polarized into hirable and economically superfluous unhirable 'extra people,' and as public institutions across the board are drained and then abandoned by an ever-more untethered transnational corporate capitalism, this feature of teaching [the teacher as necessarily a political activist] will only become more pronounced. And as structural conditions deteriorate for large segments of the school-age popu- lations, as 'savage inequalities' widen, teaching in any meaningful sense- as op- posed to, say, warehousing or surveillance- increasingly demands politicization, even radical rethinking of what it might mean to teach and learn under conditions so dehumanizing as to place ever more teachers and students 'on the edge.'"45 Conclusion Chapter one provides an imperfect blueprint and some scaffolding in preparation for the main construction project. I have deliberately refrained from writing an orthodox introduction that would have been character- ized by a neatly packaged presentation of philosophy of education. This invitation into serious philosophical discourse- especially about educa- tion-is intended to whet your appetite with regard to the rest of the book. It is my experience that a learner's interest is enlisted best when her/his serious concerns are addressed. As one becomes involved in rel- evant and difficult intellectual labor the incentive to learn about special tools increases. By way of example, there is evidence that indicates the ineffectiveness of trying to teach students how to diagram sentences gram- matically when they see little or no need to express themselves differently from their current practice. Learning more words and where to place them, as well as in the correct tense, become relevant as the need or desire to express oneself about increasingly complex thoughts and ac- tions increases. This development may also be related to the discovery of an audience for one's verbal and/or written expression. Let us involve ourselves in serious concerns about the human condition, especially as it relates to education, and learn about some tools of the trade as we be- come aware of them and their potential usefulness. The challenge to the reader is to think about what publicly defensible alternatives one could espouse in place of education for democratic em- powerment, social justice, and respect for bona fide diversity. We must make clear what these alternatives might mean within the complexities of our experience. Consider what education for your alternatives would mean.</page><page sequence="35">Introduction 35 If you do support what I favor, how would you go about defending de- mocracy, social justice, and diversity in the possible absence of cognitive certainty, objectivity, and/or terra firma upon which to stand; i.e., how would one justify the favored trio over other societal and school goals if not through alleged access to what is universally correct and good? I will argue throughout this work that there exists a secular tradition in the West and elsewhere that allows- and even demands- that the favored trio must be sought after by those who see reality as complex, uncertain, and in need of human interference and ultimate shaping. Many of the intellectual workers featured in this book believe that reality is not objec- tive data. It is neither external to the knower nor is it unaffected by the attempts of human beings to describe and, yes, master it- if only imper- fectly and temporarily. Some of these contributors have maintained that reality is in fact shaped by human action. "The activist character of hu- man beings is best represented by labor, the activity through which . . . [we] shape the social-physical realities around . . . [us], and in the pro- cess change . . . [our]selves."46 Many writers and/or activists featured in this book agree that theory can and must construct a plausible interpreta- tion of social- including educational- conditions in order to go forward toward change and improvement. The theory-builders must believe that understanding phenomena deeply and broadly is possible, and that re- construction can and should occur as an outcome of understanding. In a word, praxis is possible. Reconstruction does not just occur; it is made possible by purposive actors. Democratic actors who insist on social jus- tice and respect for diversity must view themselves as subjects, rather than objects to be hammered upon by powers seemingly beyond their control and/or understanding. Contributor Antonio Gramsci provides us with important ideas about how mass intellectual advancement can occur so that most, if not all, people will be capable of "self-rule," which is what democracy means. He maintains that those who had been shut-out of formal education in the past could respond to the power of invitation based on viewing learning as hard labor. Those who have done difficult jobs already know what hard work is. If studying is portrayed as related to physical labor those who were once excluded from formal schooling opportunities might have more confidence in their abilities to do mental labor. Such a portrayal would help demystify the world of schooling; i.e., all students could see that learning was not a form of magic or tricks that were possessed only by the well-to-do people. Gramsci portrayed studying as comprised of skills that were learnable even by those who had formerly been excluded. This</page><page sequence="36">36 Introduction achievement was thought possible in spite of their obvious handicaps with regard to leisure, tradition, and cultural capital (school readiness). For Gramsci- as well as for John Dewey and Paulo Freire- the possi- bility for the intellectual development of nearly everyone exists because the learner is not just passive, but is active and knowledgeable about many things, even if the school curriculum does not include them. Ordinary people's everyday experiences often contradict the official knowledge and view of the world imposed on them by powerful persons and institutions. Gramsci knew that everyone has a culture, even if ideas about it may not be fully developed. The learner is not an empty vessel to be filled, nor is s/he a blank sheet to be written upon. Education must begin with what the students already know as well as what may trouble them. Gramsci "begins not from the point of view of the teacher [although he believed that instruction was of great importance] but from the learner, and he emphasizes that the learning process is a movement toward self-knowl- edge. Education is not a matter of handing out 'encyclopedic knowledge' but of developing and disciplining the awareness which the learner al- ready possesses."47 The ability to learn is related to the ability to do and to be a participa- tory democrat- homo faber cannot be separated from homo sapiens. My use of these Latin words includes both genders. Each of us has a picture of the world and a somewhat conscious sense of moral conduct. It is possible to develop a new, better, and larger democratic group of intel- lectuals. Education at its best consists of the critical elaboration of the intellectual ability and activity possessed by everyone in varying degrees. The keystone to Gramsci's democratic "bias" is articulated: Differences among people's competencies, intelligence, interests, and accom- plishments do not disappear but are negotiated and understood in new ways 'between: leaders and led . . . mental and manual labour . . . politics and society . . . philosophy and science.' Gramsci never stresses differences in in- vidiously comparative terms; rather, he arranges them within a structured divi- sion of labor that is based on the foundation of skills possessed by nearly every human being. The question is not whether a division of labor is necessary but which . . . [one] . . . and for which reasons . . . . ' Relations among persons who vary a good deal in . . . their abilities . . . must be mediated with the good of all as the goal.48 This belief in the widespread distribution of intelligence and potential among us allowed Gramsci and other democrats to insist on participatory democracy based on social justice and human diversity. Democracy does not mean merely that an unskilled worker can become skilled and/or a "professional." It means that every citizen can govern; that educational</page><page sequence="37">Introduction 37 experiences are widely available in order to develop necessary critical citizen skills and meaningful empowerment. Gramsci s educational project consists of helping us understand things as they are, while at the same time laying the foundation for things as they might be. Mike Roses Lives on the Boundary described well the kind of teacher and education that flows logically from the philosophical and political underpinnings held by Gramsci and others who subscribe to a democratic "bias." Rose understood that because of social injustices according to class, race, gender, and other criteria, students are very differently equipped to "do school." His experiences as a rookie teacher in East Los Angeles made him aware that it is the whole child who is at risk in a society that fails to promote the overall welfare of each and every human being. Rose's democratic "bias" became radical because he sought, like Gramsci et al., to get to the root causes for poor school performance, political uninvolvement, poverty, crime, etc. He taught kids who could not easily master the narrow cognitive tasks so often required by school "experts," those who fail to understand why their demands are unfair. His writing assignments were designed to allow students to draw on their own expe- riences and knowledge. Rose explained that the official English curricu- lum he was supposed to use was mostly geared to grammatical analyses and subskills. This made it difficult for the exploration of the far more important communication of information, narrative construction and "shaping what we see and feel and believe into written language . . . Writing and reading [in schools] are such private acts that we forget how fundamentally [in the last analysis] social they are."49 In spite of its shortcomings, Rose was convinced that the U.S. K-12 public school system is a remarkable institutional achievement. This pub- lic system provides schooling for virtually all youngsters, including those who are poor, minorities, and those labeled as differently abled. Now we must make certain that every student who is included under the big tent of the K-12 public schools is educated for critical citizenship and empower- ment. The school experience must help prepare its students to become involved in making the praiseworthy, official rhetoric of this country a reality instead of just words. Teachers, administrators, parents, ordinary citizens- as well as students- must struggle to undo the reproductive func- tion of schooling. Rose asked us to be mindful of how the everyday con- ditions of life in the United States lay bare the weakness, and even mis- representation, of claims that our society is a level playing field from which an authentic meritocracy can arise. He asked us to "consider not only the economic and political barriers . . . [students] face, but . . . that judgments about their ability are made at a very young age, and</page><page sequence="38">38 Introduction those judgments, accurate or not, affect the curriculum they receive, their place in the school, the way they're defined institutionally. . . . Mean- while the children gradually internalize the definition the school delivers to them."50 Educators and citizens can and should use the power of invitation in order to welcome those who have been discriminated against and suffer from injustice. This invitation must not be viewed as a summons to dis- invite students who have not been historically marginalized. In Rose's words: "The more I . . . understand . . . education, the more I've come to believe in the power of invitation. Programs like the Teacher Corps- and many others that [were] developed through these [1960s] years- generated possibilities for all kinds of people who had traditionally been excluded from the schools."51 It is well known that the political, eco- nomic, social, cultural, and educational reaction against real and/or per- ceived gains made by those who were formerly excluded has sought to discredit progressive government intervention into the inequitable distri- bution of power, access, privilege, and outcomes in both school and society. I have argued throughout this chapter that radical democrats who are interested in promoting social justice as well as respect for bona fide diversity in this vast land must be fortified by, if not entirely dependent upon, certain philosophical assumptions and convictions. This is also true with regard to educational philosophy. If one does not believe that intelligence is widespread throughout various populations or, that in the absence of certainty some beliefs and courses of action are still better than others, it is difficult to see how one could hold to democratic prin- ciples. I began my introductory chapter with the classical Greeks' achieve- ments. I have held that a belief in widespread human ability to understand and act upon the world is essential to democratic politics and education. I have pointed out that there exist traditions in philosophy of education that support the democratic "bias" of which the philosopher (and educa- tional philosopher) John Dewey spoke. You are invited to wrestle intellec- tually with what you have read so far. You must critically appropriate what has been presented and decide if it makes sense to you; if not, why not? Although discussion need not occur in a formal classroom setting, it is warranted to assume that discussion about this chapter is one of the very best ways to clarify your own positions. Appendix For those readers who want to learn more about philosophy of education as a field of study in the United States, you are invited to consider this</page><page sequence="39">Introduction 39 necessarily brief historical description of it. The National Society for the Study of Education has published three volumes on philosophy of educa- tion: The Forty-first Yearbook : Part I, Philosophies of Education, copy- right 1942; The Fifty-fourth Yearbook: Modern Philosophies of Edu- cation, copyright 1955; and The Eightieth Yearbook: Part J, Philosophy and Education , published 1981. The editor for the Society of the first two is Nelson B. Henry. John S. Brubacher, chairman of the Society's Committee on Philosophies of Education, is responsible for the direction taken in the 1942 and 1955 volumes. The editor for the Society in 1981 was Kenneth J. Rehage. Brubacher s successor as chairman of the Society's Committee on Philosophy and Education is Jonas F. Soltis. Soltis is also called the editor in the 1981 volume. You can also learn about philoso- phy of education by consulting Philosophy of Education which consists of the publication of scholarly papers and responses that occur at the annual Philosophy of Education Society of the United States. There are various regional societies, e.g., the Ohio Valley Philosophy of Education Society (PES), the Midwest (PES), Southeast (PES), etc. The first of these regional societies' publications is Philosophical Studies in Education. These publications, along with the quarterly journal, Educational Theory , will allow the interested reader to enter the discourses constructed by philosophers of education in the United States, North America, and be- yond. The internet is a system where philosophers of education can be found for purposes of information and dialogue. I will take a brief look at the philosophical ideas concerning education that have been articulated in the three yearbooks as well as in the com- mentary on them. The Forty-first Yearbook states that philosophy helps determine what kind of knowledge is best suited to various educational goals. It also points out that because the 1940s were characterized as "muddled times," philosophy of education became especially useful to educators with regard to the possible relations between ends and means. This volume features serious disagreements concerning what problems in philosophy of education were most important. Five main schools of thought were selected for comparison: pragmatism, realism, idealism, Aristotelianism, and scholasticism or Catholicism. This is in keeping with the isms approach to philosophy and philosophy of education. Content endnote number 24 speaks to the isms approach to philosophy of education. The editors of the Forty-first and Fifty-fourth Yearbooks said they offer students of educational theory and practice access to "authoritative" views on key issues with respect to educational goals and procedures. Brubacher sought to identify some of the principal philosophical issues underlying education in the Fifty-fourth Yearbook. Some of the issues are rudderless</page><page sequence="40">40 Introduction education; worry about standards erosion; uncertainty about what demo- cratic education means; decline of authority; and whether schools are becoming too secular. It is obvious that these concerns are ones indicat- ing the strength of conservative voices during the mid-1950s. In spring 1956 the Harvard Educational Review , vol. 256, no. 2 devoted a whole issue to philosophy of education. The contributors to this journal were responding to two articles that appeared in the October 27, 1955 issue of The Journal of Philosophy , vol. 52, no. 22. More specifically, these articles are by: Harry S. Broudy, "How Philosophical Can Philosophy of Education Be?", pp. 612-22; and Kingsley Price, "Is A Philosophy of Education Necessary?", pp. 622-33. The Harvard Edu- cational Review is rich in terms of philosophy of education discourse and argument. Because philosophy does not change as rapidly as science and technology, it may still be worth studying the conversations of these stu- dents of philosophy and education in 1955-56. One example is William Frankena's assertion that philosophy of education consists classically of: speculation about the universe as whole and our place in it; normative criteria for action; and critical analytical evaluations of assumptions and methods, as well as careful attempts to define terms such as "real," "true," "good," "rigor," etc. Frankena argued that the normative function is most important for philosophy of education. Educators must have help as they attempt to make good decisions about what should or should not be done. Theories about the ends and compatible means of educational ac- tivity represent the normative and ethical service philosophers of educa- tion can and must provide. A special issue of the Teachers College Record , vol. 81, no 2 (Winter 1979), provided a context for understanding the Eightieth Yearbook which appeared in 1981. Jonas Soltis wrote in the Yearbook that the main purpose of that volume was to acquaint readers with how philoso- phy of education had changed since 1955, as well as how philosophy and education could be connected. Soltis was speaking about how philosophy of education had followed trends that were occurring in the parent disci- pline during the years between 1955 and 1981. The movement was away from system building and isms and toward the careful examination of important educational issues by those who saw themselves as philoso- phers interested in education rather than philosophers of education. There was an attempt to use philosophy to help educators think more critically about what they were doing. This reflected the growing specialization in academe generally. Soltis hoped that the trends in philosophy of educa- tion during the period between the Yearbooks would facilitate a congru-</page><page sequence="41">Introduction 41 enee between what philosophers of education could do, and what educa- tors expected of them and the field. Some argued that the Eightieth Yearbook represented a victory for narrow academic specialization and philosophical analysis, at the expense of a more holistic, big-picture approach. Many of these arguments for and against this victory in philosophy of education can be studied in: the symposium on the Eightieth Yearbook in the Harvard Educational Re- view , vol. 51, no. 3 (August 1981), and the special issue devoted to the Yearbook in Educational Theory , vol. 31, no. 1 (Winter 1981). David Nyberg explained, in Educational Theory, that the Yearbook reflects the state of Anglo-American philosophy at that time. One could add that this state was caused in part, by a kind of political quiescence in old, rich, and comparatively settled societies. The voices of those who were not so settled or affluent were not heard in this philosophical state of affairs. Suggested Task for the Reader Readers/students are encouraged to think about how analyzing specific issues, rather than looking critically at a whole system- whether societal or school- tends to favor the status quo. Discussion could focus on whether it should be surprising that philosophy, including philosophy of educa- tion, would be strongly affected by the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of the societies of which philosophers are a part. A source that might be helpful to enrich this discussion is Isaiah Berlin's, The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 1953). Berlin argued that the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. Berlin and Soltis seem to prefer the fox's knowledge in part, because they distrust unifying, centralizing, totalistic grand or master narratives. Students can explore some of the reasons these narratives are feared and criticized by many contemporary thinkers, especially postmodernists. On the other hand, readers might consider also Harry Broudy's argument that, "the layman [sic] is incurably metaphysical, and if the philosophy of education ignores or merely makes fun of this need, it will be satisfied from non- philosophical sources." In Chapter II, "Between the Yearbooks" in the Eightieth Yearbook , p. 27, Broudy argues, perhaps in support of the hedgehog, that wholeness of view and internal consistency are necessary. The Eightieth Yearbook does not provide either to his satisfaction. Let us consider some other critical reactions to the controversial Eighti- eth Yearbook. Barbara Arnst ine is disturbed because "the thrust ... [of the Yearbook is] toward the abstract problems of educational research</page><page sequence="42">42 Introduction . . . [Moreover, there] is the absence of any serious attempt to deal with the social, economic, and political context in which educational research and practice function." Educational Theory (Winter 1981), p. 20. A more biting criticism of the Yearbook is provided by Foster McMurray. He argued that what the contributors to the Yearbook do, mostly, "is to inform others about philosophic ideas and analytic patterns which they happen to like and which, they think, ought to be better known by educa- tors, or actually, by persons at large. [These] educational philosophers function as partisan pleaders for favorite materials from contemporary philosophy." Ibid., p. 88. McMurray suggested that this kind of philoso- phy of education is the result of these writers' belief that "educational doctrines are a function of other and more fundamental ideas about more universal human concerns. The real meat, they think, lies elsewhere than in theory of education; it [allegedly] lies in the exciting . . . higher status stuff from philosophy, political theory, and social consciousness. ... It is a way of thinking that is not only responsible for the failure of educa- tional philosophers to offer leadership in educational theory; it is also a product of bad reasoning, or of failure to understand the nature of that which is called 'philosophy of.'" Ibid., p. 89. McMurray 's arguments are indicative of disagreements among philosophers of education. Those who do not understand the value of this kind of disputation should never have power over those who do, and who must continue their valuable activi- ties. Soltis might respond to McMurray that philosophy and education are "natural allies." The Harvard Educational Review published a symposium response to the Eightieth Yearbook in 1981. Consider a critique provided by C.A. Bowers. Drawing on sociology of education, Bowers urged philosophers of education to address the problems and possibilities inherent to a per- spective that sees the world as humanly and historically constructed, there- fore amenable to progressive reconstruction. He asked that philosophers of education help students and teachers understand better "what is the relationship between political power and the language codes of different [social] classes . . . [and speech communities]. What are the metaphors of legitimization that give one speech community power over other . . . [ones]? What happens to the students' ability to exercise communicative competence . . . when the school transmits the culture ... of [some adults'] taken-for-granted knowledge?" Harvard Educational Review (August 1981), pp. 429-30. It is right to be reminded that even "expert" knowledge and/or speech is never politically or valuatively neutral. In the absence of deity-derived certainties, educators must make decisions among</page><page sequence="43">Introduction 43 complex alternatives. These alternatives often seem like competing goods, rather than clear choices between good and bad. Broudy would concur. He has suggested that philosophers of education must explain and de- fend the need for rational discussion, as well as freedom to inquire. He preferred these things over operating from a position of "fixed faith" that may not be credible and/or convincing to others. In conclusion, let us consider a persuasive, commonsense argument for those who value philosophy of education as central to teacher educa- tion. In 1982, George Kizer had the following to say in his presidential address before the Midwest Philosophy of Education Society: As philosophers of education, I believe that we have four primary audiences to serve: (1) ourselves; (2) our doctoral candidates ... ; (3) potential teachers, administrators, and other educational professionals who are in preservice prepa- ration programs; and (4) practicing professionals who now serve in our schools and who are seeking . . . professional growth and development. . . . The evidence is that our performance in serving the needs of the first two of our audiences is excellent. . . . If we cannot, however, improve our performance and communicate with professional educators in our other two audiences, I fear that support for our programs and services will be diminished with the ultimate consequence of undercutting our performance with our first two audiences. George A. Kizer, Midwest Philosophy of Education Proceedings , eds., Michael Smith and Jack Williams (Milwaukee, WI: Midwest Philosophy of Education Society, 1983), 93. Kizer was aware that professional K-12 educators can come to appreci- ate the relevance of certain philosophical insights and analyses that go beyond their present immediate concerns. He believed that philosophy of education must increase its power of invitation for those who may need it. Kizer is convinced that philosophy of education must be committed to something: "if not to democracy, then to some form of social arrange- ment that our intelligence convinces us is superior." Ibid., 97. Kizer judged the Eightieth Yearbook to be mostly an apology for increased specializa- tion and fragmentation of educational philosophy. He recommended the further development of social philosophy and greater attention to our primary audiences. Kizer would probably approve of Tony W. Johnson's Discipleship or Pilgrimage? The Educator's Quest for Philosophy (Al- bany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995) because of Johnson s insistence that philosophers of education reconstruct the field according to the problems and possibilities within the K-12 schools. Johnson was sharply critical of philosophers of education for trying to make the field just one more university guild while refusing to take responsibility for their</page><page sequence="44">44 Introduction most important constituents, K-12 students and educators. The first chap- ter provides a historical account that explains philosophy of education as a field of study. At the end of the chapter he makes common cause with Dewey by insisting the field must become philosophy as education.</page><page sequence="45">Notes 1 C.

They were thrown back upon their own souls, "upon the pursuit of personal holiness . . . emotions, mysteries and rev- elations . . . and the comparative neglect of the transitory and imperfect world for the sake of some dream-world far off, which shall . . . [be] without sin or corruption, the same yesterday, today, and forever." Five Stages of Greek Reli- gion (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1955), 4. Murray reminded us that "the best seed-ground for superstition is a society in which the fortunes of men [and women] seem to bear practically no relation to their merits and efforts." p. 127. 20 For a standard examination of classical Greek political thought, see Ernest Barker, The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1959), passim, but especially the epilogue. 21 Bowra, The Greek Experience , 209. 22 Nikos Kazantzakis, Report to Greco (New York: Bantam Books, Inc., 1961), 477-78. 23 Albert Camus, The Plague (New York: The Modern Library, 1947), 278. 24 It may be helpful at this point to provide a brief description of what some of the philosophical isms are. Ideaism (usually referred to as idealism) is characterized by a belief that reality is unchanging; its adherents hold that consciousness is prior to, and in some ways responsible for, the world in which we live. Idealism has served as philosophical justification for educational essentialism. Essentialism is based on the belief that there are certain essentials or basics that must be taught to every student. Epistemologically the essentialists claim to be certain about what they consider to be essential because they believe that this curriculum is sup- ported by the idealist belief in a reality that is unchanging as well as knowable by educated human beings. Educational essentialists have also depended on philo-</page><page sequence="47">Introduction 47 sophical realism because its adherents hold that reality is objective, independent of the knower (although knowable), constructed of forms and matter, and based on natural laws; human beings can know and rely on this physical but orderly universe without knowing the ultimate cause for its existence. As the power and prestige of science grew during the modern period, many educational essential- ists switched from philosophical idealism to its near relative, realism. Another ism that is relied on by those educators who desire certainty is Thomism, or Ferennialism. These educators seek to base their curriculum and pedagogy on a hoped-for certainty based on the synthesis of reason and faith. The great medi- eval synthesis constructed by Thomas Aquinas in the late thirteenth century is the terra firma for these educators. Perennialists and Thomists share the idea of the proactive student with philosophical pragmatists and their educational counter- parts, called progressives or instrumentalists. Pragmatists view reality as the re- sult of the interaction between human praxis and the physical social world. Prag- matists and their educational counterparts do not think that absolute certainty can be had. An instrumental, experimental concept of reality can be grasped by intelligent human beings who learn to use the scientific method. The ideas of John Dewey and those who were influenced by his work comprise the rationale for pedagogy drawn from philosophical pragmatism. Philosophical existentialism is characterized by a view that human beings can know neither the physical, social, personal worlds objectively nor completely. Existentialists are unconvinced that the pragmatist reliance on the scientific method can result in the kind of instrumental knowledge claimed. The existentialist educator stresses the difficulty and absurdity caused by human beings' desire to know where we are in space and time because the universe in their view is opaque as well as "indifferent" to the human demand for meaning. Education for existentialists consists of helping stu- dents to make personal- and I hope- (secular) ethical choices, while realizing that cognitive power is seriously limited. This "aside" is not presented as definitive. It is offered as one more tool that you can use. There are many sources that de- scribe and explain the various isms; a good place to look is among the various social foundations of education textbooks. One of the best sources, one that features breadth, depth, and intelligent interpretation, is G. Max Wingo's Phi- losophies of Education: An Introduction (Lexington, Mass.: D.C. Heath and Company, 1974). This classic philosophy of education book provides the reader with an analysis of how philosophical positions are represented by various educa- tional philosophies, curricula, and pedagogy. This analysis is done in a sociopolitical context. For another useful source on the isms approach to philosophy of educa- tion, see Howard A. Ozman and Samuel M. Craver, Philosophical Foundations of Education , 5th ed. (Columbus, Ohio: Merrill, an imprint of Prentice Hall, 1995), passim. See also the appendix to this chapter. 25 A useful and readable book for learning about and discussing various ideas con- cerning our "nature" is Leslie Stevenson's Seven Theories of Human Nature (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974). 26 Richard Brosio, unpublished work on an experimental philosophy course for high school students from around the San Diego Unified School District, 1968.</page><page sequence="48">48 Introduction 27 Wingo, Philosophies of Education: An Introduction, 22.
