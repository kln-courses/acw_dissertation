<plain_text><page sequence="1">105 PLUS pA CHANGE, PLUS C'EST LA MEME CHOSE: THE DILEMMA OF THE FRENCH STRUCTURAL MARXISTS Douglas E. Goodfriend THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES Structure and Change Among the French Structural Marxists The Marxist position [ 1 ] on socio-cultural transformation as retailed by Althusser/Balibar [2] and Godelier is adapted to mechanistic cybernetics and Levi-Straussean structuralism. The versions of the Marxist positon adopted by Althusser/Balibar and Godelier are almost identical but there are certain differences with reference to the role of the individual in his? tory and the influence of the economic do? main in other domains. This will become clear as the analysis unfolds. The classic Marxist formulation of the na? ture of intra-systemic relations goes back to Marx and Engels' distinction between infra? structure and superstructure and their famous statements on the role of the economy in social order and process [3]. Both Althusser and Godelier elaborate in some detail the character of this articulation. Althusser distinguishes between relations of dominance and relations of determination, and appropriates the notion of "determination in the last instance" by the economy. This means that the economic basis of a socio cultural system always determines which domain of that system will be dominant and play the pivotal role in determining the hierarchical order of articulation of all other domains (parts of the whole). Thus one part of the whole ultimately determines the order? ing of all the other parts and the rise to dominance of one of them [4]. There is an attempt to integrate this hierarchy model with a closed-loop mechanistic feedback model in which all domains condition each other, and the structure of the whole effects the internal and external relations of the parts. Althusser develops this part of his theory under his notion of "structural causality," also considered as the "over determination" of each part of the whole [5]. In this aspect of the theory, the structure of the whole determines the nature and role of the parts. This stands in contrast to the first consideration of the model in which one dominant part determined the ordering of all other parts [6]. Clearly, the Althusser/Balibar attempt to integrate a Marxist version of control hier? archy theory with a cybernetic feedback model is incomplete, leaving hazy some funda? mental issues concerning the relations of wholes and parts. Their structural causality loses its systemic force in competition with an ultimate, linear economic determinacy. That is, the relation of hierarchy to feedback is poorly developed [7]. This is part of the larger problem of the relative autonomy of domains which nevertheless are said to mutu? ally determine or condition one another. Althusser, influenced by Lacan's neo Freudianism, uses a mirror metaphor to ex? plain the participation of the economic base in all the other domains of its socio-cultural system. This is expressed in terms of the "re *Douglas Goodfriend studies anthropology at the University of Chicago.</page><page sequence="2">106 flection in contradiction itself of its conditions of existence... in society, the economy" [8]. On the economic domain Althusser writes ... the only way to the essence of the economic is to construct its concept, i.e., to reveal the site occupied in the structure of the whole by the region of the econo? mic, therefore to reveal the articulation of this region with other regions (legal-political and ideological super? structure), and the degree of presence (or effectivity) of the other regions in the economic region itself... Not only is the economic a structured region occupying its particular [sic] in the global structure of the social whole, but even in its own site, in its (relative) regional autonomy, it functions as a regional structure and as such determines its elements [9]. Apart from suggesting the diffuse nature of domains beyond their "sites" and into the economic "site," this metaphor does not specify the sets of relations among various do? mains. The explicit geographic metaphor gives the sense of domains as pieces of real estate (sites), the buildings on which (structures) are metaphysically reproduced in part or whole on other pieces of property (particularly other domains appearing in the economic "region," and the economic domain's deter? minations appearing as condensing contra? dictions in any domain [ 10]. While one can dismiss the metaphor, the theoretical problem is real: what is the relation between diversified human activities and their institutionalized structures of thought and action, and more importantly what is the relation among these relations, i.e. what is the effect of system on structure? It appears then that structural causality with its mirroring metaphor con? ceals rather than answers the more funda? mental questions about the exact relations between domains. Furthermore, as it is used in Althusser's model, structural causality actu? ally has the same tautological explanatory power as did "human nature," "instinct," or "drives" for eighteenth and nineteenth cen? tury sociology and psychology: a change in structure is explained with reference to its. immanent necessity. Such a model of inherent necessity and surface conflict, reminiscent Maurice Godelier's approach to intra systemic relations is very similar to Althusser's at this level of analysis. Relying on the same metaphor, he uses a sectionally reflectionist model to situate the economic base outside its own domain, such as in kinship systems, where it is a "particular aspect of all non economic activities" [11]. Relative to "archaic society" Godelier writes: We need in fact to analyse more closely these kinship re? lations, for if they determine the places occupied by in? dividuals in production, their rights to land and goods, their obligations in respect to work and gifts, etc., then they function as production-relations, just as they func? tion as political, religious, etc., relations. Kinship is thus here both infrastructure and superstructure... the deter? mining role of the economy, apparently contradicted by the dominant role of kinship, is rediscovered in this dominant role, since kinship function as, inter alia, production-relations. Here the relationship between eco? nomy and kinship appears as an internal relationship ? without the economic relationships of the kinsfolk merging, for all that, with their political, sexual, etc., relationships [ 12]. Diagrammatically, this model might look some? thing like this: For Godelier, the economic domain is at once both an independent site and an "aspect" or, as Althusser would say, a "presence" in other domains [ 13 ]. Like Althusser, Godelier has it both ways: other domains are contained within the economic, and the economic appears within other domains. And like Althusser's structural causality, Godelier's structural causality and "function as" statements address the issue but do not fully resolve it. Thus, Godelier's model is susceptible to the same criticisms as Althusser's, including the prob? lems of explanation via immanent necessity [ 14]. Furthermore, both models begin in the first moment of analysis with separate sites or</page><page sequence="3">107 domains which in the second moment of ana? lysis must be somehow articulated with one another. This would seem to retain the cate? gories of our bourgeois socio-cultural system at a meta-level of analysis. Most significantly, it distorts indigenous cultural logics and their meaningful organization of thought, behavior, and institutions. As Marshall Sahlins recently pointed out, in his analysis of Terray's work, the vulgar Marxist importation of the central ity of "modes of production" into tribal cul? tures not only deforms the indigenous system, but is reduced to an argument for technologi? cal determinism [15]. Both Althusser and Godelier, insisting on the ultimate determining status of the economic domain, replicate the category of their own society and its own par? ticular hierarchy of domination. This point is related to the more general problem with these theories: economy-dominated hierarchies of determination presume culture or subsume it in "structure," thus failing to account for, as a separable factor of analysis, a fundamental aspect of socio-cultural systems [ 16]. Individual Will and Willful Structures One of the points in the Marxist analyses where the consideration of culture becomes problematical is in the treatment of individu? ality. Both Althusser and Godelier address the issue of the role of the individual in history. They differ in their assessment but each de cultures the individual in his own way. According to Althusser, individuality is historically determined and individuals merely serve as "supports" (Tr?ger) for structures [ 17]. Individual consciousness reflects the false, pro? jected but necessary (fetishized) image of the structures of a society [ 18]. Godelier, on the other hand, like Sartre [19], writes of the actions of individuals going beyond their in? tentions and into a level of structural ratio? nality within which they must then exist [20]. Despite his awareness of the cultural char? acter of need [21 ], and his criticism of eco? nomic theories which begin with the individual [22], Godelier's own formulations often seem to assume individuality as an uncritical cate? gory [23] and echo a classical Hobbesian model of convergence and clash of individual wills that "has never been anyone's conscious plan or the aim pursued by any individual" [24]. This approach is taken almost word for word Engel's famous letter to Bloch (21 September 1890). Althusser, sticking to his structural causality, attacks this position savagely, calling it "the myth of homo oeconomicus" [25]. Both Althusser and Godelier inadequately account for the articulations between cul? ture and consciousness: Althusser by reducing culture to structure as he reduces individuals to supports, and Godelier by assuming indi? viduality as a pre-defined category within a structured system but without that structure and its culture determining the nature of indi? viduality as such [26]. The consequence for Althusser's theory of social change is that in? dividuals play little or no causal role in the process which is presumably animated by structure's own immanent causality. Thus, there is little room in this position for the de? velopment of class consciousness in individuals on which Althusser relies as one expression ("condensation") of contradictions leading to social transformation ("explosion") [27]. His anthropomorphic formulation of structural causality and effectivity precludes his address? ing this problem. The consequence of Gode? lier's position on individuality for his theory of social change is that Godelier can posit their action as one device to get from one structural order to another, to aid and abet structure's own causality. Both scholars refer to this im? manent necessity of structural change under the Marxist rubric of contradiction. The Inner and Outer Limits of Structure Althusser/Balibar and Godelier share a com? mon vocabulary of "limits of invariance," cor? respondence of structures", and "development of contradictions". Both theories distinguish between secondary contradiction(s) and a</page><page sequence="4">108 primary contradiction which is the "motor" of structural change. While the same primary contradiction, that between the productive forces and the relations of production, is the "motor of change," the two formulations are in direct opposition in their breakdown and positioning of the aspects of the contradiction [28]. Godelier writes: We have here contradictions within a system and also con? tradictions between this system and others... the char? acteristic features of this first contradiction... (is that it) is internal to a structure. It is specific to the capatalist mode of production. It defines it as such... Being specific, it is characteristic of the system from its beginning, and the very working of the system endlessly reproduces it.. [The other contradiction is] not a contradiction within a structure but between two structures. It is thus not directly a contradiction between individuals or between groups but a contradiction between the structure of the productive forces [their more and more advanced soci? alization] and the structure of the production-relations [the private ownership of the productive forces]. Now, the paradox is that this contradiction, which is funda? mental, since it has to account for the evolution of capitalism and for the necessity of its disappearance, is not original, in the sense that it did not exist in the system at its beginning. It appears "at a certain stage" ... [29]. The primary contradiction, the "motor of change," is, for Godelier, a contradiction be? tween two structures. Balibar describes these same structures and their contradiction in this way: The social formation is the site of a first 'contradiction' between the classes... Here it is related just as to its es? sence to a second form of 'contradiction' which Marx is always very careful not to confuse with the first... he calls it an 'antagonism' ... i.e. not a struggle between men but an antagonistic structure; it is inside the eco? nomic base, typical of a determinate mode of production, and its terms are called 'the level of the productive forces' and 'the relations of production'. The antago? nism between the productive forces and the relations of production has the effect of a revolutionary rupture, and it is this effect which determines the transition from one mode of production to another....and thereby the transformation of the whole social formation [30]. Here the "motor of change" is a contradiction within one structure. This difference of model boundaries in formulating the same primary contradiction is critical for all that follows in the analysis of social change. While both conceptions of change contain a notion of accumulation of secondary, non determining contradictions [31 ], Godelier's principal contradiction between two struc? tures reaches "a threshold, to the conditions in which a structure does not change" [32] based upon and developed out of [33] the secondary contradiction. This latter contradic? tion is internal to the structure from its incep? tion, actively antagonistic, and yet unable to change the structure on its own because it is "within a system" [34]. Godelier writes: The first contradiction appears with the system and dis? appears with it. The second appears with the develop? ment of the system, and as an effect of the functioning of the first contradiction; but it is fundamental in char? acter because it creates the material conditions for the possibility of the system's disappearance. The relation between these two contradictions thus shows that the first contradiction, internal to the relations of production, does not contain within itself all the conditions for its own solution. The material conditions of this solution can exist only outside it, because the productive forces are a reality completely distinct from the production relations and not reducible to them, a reality that has its own internal conditions of development and its own time-dimension [35]. Godelier's formulation of social change criti? cally depends here upon formualting the prob? lem as one in which a second contradiction (the principal one) is between two distinct structures and is the developed result of lesser, antagonistic yet non-determining, contradic? tions of original immanent "non-correspon? dence" within structures (particularly the re? lations of production). At both levels of contradiction there is a notion of the "limits" within which contradictions will not cause structural change. For Althusser the principal contradiction, because it is seen as being within one struc? ture in his model, is articulated to secondary contradictions in an altogether different re? lation. Althusser's principal contradiction is "embodied in" the class struggle (as one of its possible manifestations) which is Godelier's non-principal contradiction. This principal contradiction's two parts, production relations and production forces, are the "motor of</page><page sequence="5">109 change" for Althusser [36]. This motor is re? lated to non-determining secondary contra? dictions, being "inhibited" or "non-antagonis? tic" [37] until suddenly activated in a momen? tary "fusion". Althusser also describes this rela? tion as one between "dominant" and "second? ary" contradiction in which the "general" con? tradiction is said to be "active in" all the other contradictions [38], and the site of dominance may vary. The actual mechanism causing the "revolutionary rupture" or "fusion" is never clear in Althusser's writing though it is said to be the result of processes of "displacement" and "condensation" within a larger three-stage process. In this process all contradiction is non antagonistic in the first stage, which merely involves quantitative non-restructuring change. But, magically quantity turns to quality, through a second antagonistic stage, in the "qualitative leap" of "mutation" (= "ruptural unity," "fusion") of the third stage [39]. The relationship of this leap ("the moment of global condensation" [40]) to the previously non-antagonistic stage one and antagonistic stage two of contradiction, and the relation of stage one to stage two, and the relationship of all active contradiction to a structure de? scribed as "invariant" are unspecified [41 ]. The sufficient and necessary cause for the move? ment from one stage to another is not given. One only has the sense of change as a flash flood. Somehow structure has been separated from process and hence from system. Is there then some notion of limits to account for this movement? Balibar suggests that this Gode lierian solution is inadequate but does not specify the other conditions [42]. Godelier has a similar problem at the point in which his principal contradiction develops out of secondary contradiction. He states: sphere of the system" [44]. But he does not specify how the development of the produc? tive forces occurs. Is there an implied appeal to human reason? There is no structural neces? sity for this development explained; it is mere? ly given as an immanent necessity. It should be apparent that both Godelier and Althusser have difficulty with transitions from one structural order to another. For Godelier, non-determining but active contradic? tion reaches the point of producing the pos? sibility of a principal active contradiction, which contradiction is the motor of social change. But this process isn't explained. For Althusser, non-determining secondary contra? dictions accumulate inactively and in the pro? cess of constant changes of strategic value [45] until the right combination is reached, result? ing in a revolutionary structural dissolution and restructuring. Again, the mechanics of ac? tivation are unclear. This leads us to the center of the problem of structure and contradiction; what is this relationship? In Godelier's model, systemic structural re? lations at their limits constitute the determin? ing, principal contradiction. Non-determining, "simmering" contradiction is an immanent characteristic of, and located within, the struc? ture of production relations. It too has limits at which it generates the conditions for prin? cipal contradiction [46]. It is active but region? al, antagonistic but limited. Secondary contra? diction is thus structural instability induced within the limits of structural flexibility. Prin? cipal contradiction is global restructuring in? duced at the limits of systemic flexibility. According to Althusser, structure does not function within limits. Rather, structure is "invariant" and contradiciton is the variation and cause of the "mutation" of the invariant structure [47]. As in Althusser's formulation of the articulations of domains, again the metaphor of reflection is used to describe the relation of contradiction to structure [48]. Again the metaphor conceals the mechanics and quality of the articulation. As well, the metaphor suggests an original state of separa The class contradictions within the relations of produc? tion may "simmer" but no solution will emerge neces? sarily, unless there is development of the productive forces.... [43]. Elsewhere he refers to this as "the propulsive</page><page sequence="6">110 ration in the model between structure and contradiction which must then be related via reflection. Once this differentiation is made, then the systemic character of structure as process collapses in the breach. Althusser has slipped into the old social science problematic of the radical separation of structure and change (process). It is at this point of transition, of active contradiction inducing structural change, that Balibar attempts to supplement and expand Althusser's theory. Balibar develops a theory of transition in which transition itself is a mode of production. According to Balibar, a period of transition is a period in which two or more modes of production coexist [49] and there is a "non-correspondence" both within the economic domain and among do? mains [50]. This non-correspondence aspect of the model is called the theory of disloca? tions. With this idea of non-correspondence or dislocation Balibar develops a theory of lim? its of his own ? explicitly distinguished from Godelier's model which Balibar believes only gives a non-determining cyclic contradiction an unearned position of causal dominance [51]. For Balibar, Godelier's contradiction be? tween structures represents an "internal con? tradiction" which "does not tend toward the supersession of the contradiction, but to the perpetuation of its conditions" [52]. These are dislocations within the economic domain by Balibar's reckoning of boundaries [53]. The reproduction of the whole structure can and will continue with cyclic breakdown and reconstitution at this level of contradiction [54]. It is only at the level of dislocations be? tween domains that supersession of contra? diction is possible. But Balibar writes: last instance" by the economy which we pre? viously examined, and secondly, "as the deter? mination of the limits within which the effect of one practice can modify another practice from which it is relatively autonomous" [56]. Thus for Balibar, a theory of reciprocal limi? tation among domains rests on the structure of the modes of production [57]. That struc? ture by itself cannot induce change but it is necessary and determinant of the inter-domain contradiction which does lead to radical struc? tural dissolution. Balibar's discussion of limits and dislocation is confused by an Althusserian metaphor he uses to describe the relation of structure to contradiction: a metaphor of cause and effect in which structure is the cause (invariant) and contradiction is the effect (variation). Balibar states that they are the same [58], yet he also writes that "there is only a contradiction be? tween the effects, the cause is not divided in itself, it cannot be analysed in antagonistic terms" [59]. The question that this metaphor attempts to address was clearly stated by Godelier: "For how can the hypothesis of the appearance of internal contradictions inside a system be reconciled with the thesis that the functioning of this system necessarily repro? duces its conditions of functioning? [60]. Balibar's dislocation model evades specifying causal determination of the appearance of contradiction by reference to a cause-effect metaphor which is a tricky dissimulation of the solution. The dislocation is allegedly not between the structures, but rather between their "effects" [61]. Structure (cause) is not contradictory, but contradiction (effect) is structured. The solution to the question of what moves the simple reproduction of the functioning socio-economic formation into non-correspondence is concealed in, and pre? sumably explained by the separation/non separation that the cause-effect metaphor makes between structure and contradiction. If structure is both the same as contradiction and yet invariant, what is the force or situation that The mode of 'correspondence' between the different levels of the social structure... depends in turn on the form of the internal correspondence of the structure of production [55]. This dependence is in two respects according to Balibar: firstly, the "determiniation in the</page><page sequence="7">Ill changes internal regular cyclic contradiction into restructuring contradiction? The quantity to quality argument is vigorously rejected [62]. An argument for the "internal tendencies" of the system as the sole causal mechanism is con? sidered insufficient [63]. After very careful analysis of an intricate argument it finally be? comes apparent that, for Balibar, what supple? ments the internal tendencies of systems to? wards dissolution is the spontaneous develop? ment of the productive forces [64]. At one point in the argument he states: The antagonism between the productive forces and the relations of production has the effect of a revolutionary rupture, and it is this effect which determines the tran? sition from one mode of production to another... and thereby the transformation of the whole social forma? tion [65]. But this antagonism develops out of an invari? ant structure by virtue of "the concentration of production and the growth of the prole? tariat" [66]. In fact, this is little more than a supplemented quantity-to-quality argument. It appears, then, that what is not invariant in structure is (a) its exponential growth (which is not determinant of change) and (b) the growth of the population component of the productive forces (which is critical). By stating that structure is not contradictory but that these effects are, Balibar rescues invariant structure, a necessity of this model of socio? economic order, from the perils of inhering ruptural characteristics. Why can't structure itself be contradictory? Because that would create the problem of explaining how any par? ticular socio-economic system can reproduce itself without qualitative change, and within quantitative limits, when in this model such a system is static [67]. With the cause-effect me? taphor and the population bomb, the problem is theorized away. Turning to the details of structural change as envisioned in this model, Balibar writes: the constitution of the structure is a 'find' [trouvaille] constituted by 'finding already there' [vorfinden] the elements which its structure combines. ...it means that the formation...is completely indifferent to the origin and genesis of the elements which it needs, 'finds,' and 'com? bines' ... Instead of uniting the structure and the history of its formation, the genealogy separates the results from its pre-history. It is not the old structure which itself has transformed itself, on the contrary, it has really 'died out' as such [68]. Despite pronouncements against "moments of destructuration," the sense of this theory of transition is that time stops, structural elements play musical chairs, and then the music begins again. In this model, the continuity is of the parts, not of structure. System as such has dis? appeared entirely. Even the continuity of the parts is only of form and not of content, as Balibar writes of the "radical absence of mem? ory" which characterizes the elements of the old order now restructured. In the first place, this is rather undialectical. Secondly, Balibar's formulation reveals the non-cultural quality of this model's elements. Culture has been sub? sumed uncritically under structure. Finally, the relation of these parts or elements to a whole which articulates them in transition is underdeveloped leaving fundamental questions about how parts change. To consider this movement of parts to be a "mode of produc? tion" in its own right [69] is to merely bring in the same concept as was used to describe the prior invariant structure in order to bridge an unnecessary gap between sequential structural orders caused by an originally faulty separation of structure and change. It has little analytic value [70]. System and Structure: Concluding Remarks on Struc? tural Marxism The Structural Marxist position as elaborated by Althusser, Balibar, and Godelier suffers from three interrelated problems: (1) a confusion of system and structure, (2) the disapperance of culture into structure, and (3) the arbitrary and ethnocentric labelling and drawing of domain boundaries and their hierarchical order. These general problems are evident in the</page><page sequence="8">112 Althusser/Balibar formulations in the form of four issues: (1) the relations of over determina? tion to determination in the last instance, i.e. the problem of hierarchy and the autonomy of domains. This has been adequately discussed already. The second issue is the relations of parts and wholes. Althusser writes that the whole is present in the relations of its parts (effects) and that wholes and parts are analyti? cally inseparable. This suggests that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts and no more [71]. Yet Althusser's discussion of the displace? ments effected by the structure of the whole upon its elements suggests system's effect upon constituent structures. Althusser's discussion of the inherent unevenness yet unity of the whole is also suggestive of a systemic model. Yet in the midst of all this mutual influence within hierarchical constraints and systemic displacement, Althusser insists that the causal? ity governing each element, while due to the structure of the whole, is determined in the last instance by the economy because that com? mands the hierarchical ordering of the struc? ture of the whole. Here there is a trace of linear causality in the midst of a systemic model. Althusser himself states that he is not yet clear on the relations between hierarchy and autonomy [72]. The third issue is the separation of structure and change as evident in his formulation of this relation as one of cause and effects, of in? variant structure and variations of contradic? tions. Like Godelier's constant part of a struc? ture, Althusser maintains a continuity of sorts through change: in his model, the continuity is of the same parts which change places and hence, articulations with other parts. Althusser's (and Balibar's) parts-continuity is the functional equivalent in their theory that Godelier's con? stant part of a structure is to his theory. Both are there to account for consistency through change. The problems of this parts-continuity model and its attendant cause-effect metaphor for structure and change have been noted; its non-cultural quality will be mentioned shortly. As for the triggering of change in this model, the immanent necessity of change has been suggested by Althusser and Balibar but the dy? namics of this self-regulation are not clearly worked out and are teleological in their reli? ance on the development of the productive forces. Any domain may be a "condensation site" in this model of change, but the "real" contradiction, the real prime mover with Althusser and Balibar, as with Godelier, must be the formulation of the contradiction between the productive forces and the productive rela? tions, propelled into causal determinacy by population growth [73]. The fourth and final issue in the Althusser/ Balibar theoretical model of social order and social change is the collapse of culture into structure. There is no separate analytic consid? eration given to a social order's cultural logic. On the one hand, it is dismissed as superstruc? ture (i.e. ideology, which far from covers the content of the category) while on the other hand, it is presumed as a component of the structural order. This is especially apparent in their analysis of change as a continuity of parts in which the past (elements) of a struc? ture disappear in their structural reconstitu tion. For Balibar and Althusser the pasts (e.g. the productive forces) can disappear because such Marxist categories are fundamentally Western structural categories taken here as simple non-cultural universals. Apart from their ethnocentricity, there is a moment in such analyses when the cultural order of economic relations is taken as given "rendering it neutral and inert" [74]. Humans don't merely see pro? duction in symbolic terms, production itself is culturally constituted and motivated. There is absolutely no awareness of this in the struc? tural Marxist formulation in which the restruct? uring of social orders is presumed to take place in consideration of the self-evident require? ments of structure. In fact, one is finally con? fronted with nothing more than a theory of structural utilitarianism. And, in contrast to the disappearing act of Althusser/Balibar's</page><page sequence="9">113 pasts of these elements, it is fair to say that in a socio-cultural order, nothing ever disappears. The cultural meaning and significance of the various behaviours, thoughts, and institutions which constitute a society may conceivably drop out of the consciousnesses of its actors, but the effects (as presence or absent presence) of their prior meaning and organization are con? stituted in the very existence and reproduction of the society, even in modified or "new" form. It is in the nature of cultural symbols that they cannot disappear. Godelier's theoretical model also reflects the three general problems of the structural Marxist approach. They are evident in the issues of (1) the nature of the economic domain's participa? tion in other domains, which has already been discussed at length, (2) the separation of struc? ture and change in a formula such that struc? tures must "tolerate" events [75]. As Emmanuel Terray put it, in such models "change appears as a foreign body, as a sort of poison which the structure must eliminate or die" [76]. Godelier has taken Sartre's problematic of human action and intent versus the practico inert [77] and substituted the word "structure" for "practico-inert". This is the theoretical status which Godelier seems to give to the struc? tured whole into which human action is placed and its effects displaced. Sartre's statement that "language and culture are not inside the individual., it is the individual who is inside culture and inside language" [78] becomes Godelier's statement that "the intentional be haviorial rationality of the members of a soci? ety is always inscribed within the basic unin? tentional rationality" of the total system with? in which they live [79]. Sartre refers to this as "impersonal," "monstrous," "counter-finali? ties" which are unintentionally created by man's actions and then forever constrain him. In such a model structure seems to play the role that "tradition" does for the tradition versus modernity theorists. Like Althusser, Godelier's model radically separates structure and process. A concept of limits suggests a range of "compatible variations" within which structure can tolerate process [80], but this brings us to the third issue: Godelier expli? citly ascribes, by his notion of limits, a con? stant element to structure which is reproduced and within which the variations leading to con? tradiction appear [81 ]. What this element is, how it is to be analytically distinguished, and why its constancy is necessary have yet to be explained. Nor again, as with Althusser, is the relationship between the constant element (Althusser's invariant structure) and contradic? tion, or incompatible variation (Althusser's variations of contradiction) explicated. The notion of limits by itself is inadequate to ex? plain the development of "contradictions born of the functioning of the system" [82]. Be? sides the possibilities of varieties of change in? duced at the limits, and varieties of limit fac? tors, the concept itself is, like structural cau? sality, a tautology. It cannot explain why a structure formerly in equilibrium within limits goes beyond its limits. This brings us to the fourth point: As in the instance of Althusser and Balibar, the sole critical factor in structural change in Godelier's model is " the develop? ment of the productive forces". Whether or not this is the same growth-of-the-proletariat popu? lation aspect of that development is not speci? fied [83]. Finally, insofar as Godelier's model participates in Sartre's problematic of the prac tico-inert, it is the model of a world without people because the manifestations of struc? tures are culturally meaningful objects, and Godelier's structure, mechanistically tolerating events is treated more like a deus ex machina than a culturally-constituted human creation. Godelier seems to have simply replaced a bour? geois economic anthropological focus on the individual and his rationality with a focus on "individuals" as an "abstract aggregate" with its own rationality [84]. But this is still not a systems level analysis, for the whole is a mere aggregate of individual actions against the prac tico-inert of their previous intended actions, now developed into unintended consequences.</page><page sequence="10">114 Further, even a systems level analysis in which the modalities of existence of the whole ex? ceed and differ from the modalities of its constituent parts must theoretically consider that the universe as it is known and acted in by humans is a cultural universe. Thus any rationality of the whole must be a rationality which has continuity with the cultural logic which animates the system in the first instance. For Godelier, as for Althusser and Balibar, such cultural logics collapse uncritically into structure. In addition, for Godelier, structures are somehow above culture. To summarize briefly how both Althusser/ Balibar and Godelier approach the general problems of social transformation theory, it seems that, in varying degrees on the various points, both (1) see the process of history as necessary, and at the present juncture, the ne? cessary and good (r)evolution of capitalism into socialism, (2) have a one-dimensional ex? planation of the cause of change ultimately residing in the economic domain, specifically the development of the productive forces, (3) require radical structural change in order to arrive at any restructuring of a system; all other change being subsumed under the notions of quantitative or cyclic change, and (4) confuse system and structure and mystify the nature of their articulations. Nonetheless these theories are valuable in their attempt to (1) decenter social change theory from its focus on the in? dividual as agent or obstacle to change, (2) outline the relations of system to structure, (3) consider varieties of change-modalities, (4) measure change in terms of the internal con? ditions and functioning of an on-going system, and (5) consider all the elements of a society as active aspects in any transition. The structu? ral Marxists thus provide an adequate point of departure from which to synthesize the diverse traditions of cybernetic theory, Marx? ist analysis, and cultural anthropology into a Marxist cultural theory of system and structure. CASE STUDY: SOUTH INDIA Two studies of the Tamil village area of Thaiyur panchayat, in Chingleput District near Madras in South India represent prime exam? ples of the application of structural Marxist theory to ethnographic data. In these studies, conducted by the Swedish anthropologists Goran Djurfeldt and Staffan Lindberg [85], the cultural significance of behaviour and ideas falls prey to distortion in the service of vulgar Marxist theory. There is hardly any ethnogra? phy evident in the work and this, in itself, is quite significant. Is is symptomatic of the cur? rent tendencies in the use of such a theoretical framework to interpret ethnographic data. Needless to say, Godelier and Althusser cannot be held responsible for such use of their theo? ries in ethnographic praxis. However, until Godelier completes his own research in New Guinea these studies must suffice. Djurfeldt and Lindberg's field notes are reduced to what amount to qualified guesses compressed into exploitation-ratio charts and compounded into generalized theories of Indian society and history. This is not to say that rich ethnogra? phies are impossible using a Marxist frame? work (just the contrary is the case), but the Djurfeldt and Lindberg studies represent in extreme form the tendencies of structural Marx? ist analysis to reduce the richness and depth of an indigenous cultural order to the bones of ethnocentric abstraction. The criticisms which follow are made to strengthen and clari? fy Marxist ethnography. In the "Introductory perspectives" section of Behind Poverty: The Social Formation in a Tamil Village Djurfeldt and Lindberg set out their theoretical model [86]. They claim to be in fundamental agreement with both Althusser and Godelier except on a few minor points. They take issue with Godelier on the relation? ship between kinship and the economic do? main; ...we have been unable to follow Godelier when he inter? prets infrastructure as a functional distinction. This al</page><page sequence="11">115 lows him to say that in primitive societies kinship func? tions as infrastructure ...If this is to mean that "kinship is thus here both infrastructure and superstructure"... then the material content of Ihe infrastructure is lost, and, with it, an essential ingredient of historical materialism [87]. Referring to a later Godelier article, Djurfeldt and Lindberg clarify their approach to the issue: ...it is clear that kinship and relations of production are structures of a different order; the latter is an abstract concept referring to a material reality, while the former refers to the subjective genealogical categories in which people apprehend of their interrelations....the explana? tion of the dominance of kinship is to be sought...in the relations of production (i.e. in the basis). It can also ex? plain what happens when, as a result of class differenti? ation, production relations are no longer apprehended as kinship relations, but get another interpretation... Then kinship ceases to be dominant, but may still retain political, juridical, and ideological functions. In Thai yur, for example, we will interpret the functions of kinship as mainly ideological...The basis thus determines the functions of the superstructure [88]. The effect of this approach will be analysed shortly but it is already obvious that Djurfeldt and Lindberg dismiss anything utilizing indi? genous categories as "ideology," or "false consciousness". As for Althusser, they attempt to refine his concept of "determination in the last instance" by suggesting a notion of mutual constraint which they term "restrictive determination". Basically this means that the infrastructure retains the ultimate primacy of determination of the social formation but that it only "re strictively" determines the possible forms of the superstructure [89]. At the same time, the various domains of the superstructure restric tively constrain one another. This revision of Althusser is an attempt to stress the "relative autonomy" of the superstructure aspect of Althusser's work, but it still shares the ultimate determination of social order and process by the economy. The notion of determination in the last instance is used both implicitly and explicitly throughout their studies [90]. In their analysis of the economic domain, Djurfeldt and Lindberg are opposed to Emmanuel Terray's notions about the combina? tion of modes of production [91]. Instead they seem to accept Etienne Balibar's notion that a period of transition is a mode of production in its own right [92]. To these Marxist theories Djurfeldt and Lindberg add a variety of other models and methods. First, they add their own brand of Weberian "verstehen", with the qualification that: ... verstehen is in principle only a rather trivial prelim? inary to the scientific explanation as such. Science be? gins when we want to explain the subjective categories in which individuals conceive their own behaviour and the structures in which they are placed. When we take this step from description to explanation, we switch from verstehende Soziologie to historical materialism .... [93]. This opens the door to a central feature of their "explanation," a constant reference to the West, both for the categories of the ana? lysis as well as ethnocentric presumptions about medicine, biology, land, labour, wealth, and status. What is not explained through the explicitly Western categories is usually ex? plained through ethnocentric presumptions concerning the nature of human action in the world. There is virtually no consideration given to indigenous categories and explanations. These are dismissed as "ideological", parallelling simplistic emic-etic, so-called cultural materi? alistic distinctions. Djurfeldt and Lindberg also constantly refer to a generalized model of Indian society based upon "progressive historical research" [94]. Their model defines Indian features in terms of similarity to various phases in the history of Western civilization. Finally, the authors occasionally resort to quasi-ecological arguments which are not well articulated with the Marxist perspective [95]. The distortions caused by the application of all of these theoretical orientations are most visible in Djurfeldt and Lindberg's analysis of Thaiyur panchayat, including their own general</page><page sequence="12">116 ized model of Indian society. I shall turn now to that analysis. History in the Application of Historical Materialist Theory to Ethnography Early in their interpretation of medieval India and the transformations of the social for? mation during that period Djurfeldt and Lindberg write: The ethnographic present of the archaic and exotic India found in anthropological monographs can he1 placed in the Middle Ages, c. 400-1200 A.D. [96]. (their emphasis). In effect these anthropologists create history out of ethnography. What is more, their "history" is a reification of the ahistorical static-India claims of the ethnographies of the 1950's. It is surprising to find this in an alleged? ly dialectical treatment of social process but this contradiction between an equilibrium model and dialectics is problematic throughout their studies. It is a reflection in practice of the theoretical problems that both Althusser and Godelier have with the relation between system, structure, and contradiction. This reconstructed history of the medieval social formation acts as another constant back? drop against which to explain the contempo? rary situation [97]. It is critical therefore to note at the outset that this history, the "exotic present" projected back in time, has absolute? ly no legitimate basis in actual texts of the period. When Djurfeldt and Lipdberg do refer to texts such as Manu-smrti, it is only to con? demn them as ideology [98]. A good example of this misuse of (fantasy) history is in their analysis of caste and class. Caste, Class, and Ideology: Marxist Maya and Is Dumont a Secret Braham? In discussing the general relation of caste to class, Djurfeldt and Lindberg write that "the entire social formation is dominated by the caste system" and that, in medieval India, "class position is ascribed by caste position" [99]. However, due to British influence on land ownership, "the ancient caste dominance was transferred to the new relations of pro? duction and the foundation of the present class structure was laid". They add that "at the same time the unity between class and caste slowly started to dissolve" [100]. As land ownership is considered to be the basis of class in Thaiyur, the argument that the dominance of the social formation has shifted from caste to class, with the attendant result that caste to? day is simply an ideology, a fetishized maya (illusion) of the "real" social relations, is based on Djurfeldt and Lindberg's premise that pri? vate ownership of land did not exist in India prior to the British [ 101 ]. This, in turn is based on turning a historically-determined definition into an abstract, global definition of private property, which is considered to be an inevit? able, universal stage of development in the evolution of modes of production, one that in this case the British introduced to India. How? ever, it is not clear that such transformations did occur in India because both the descriptive categories of evolving forms of ownership and the process itself are based on the unique West? ern European development. It was to explain that unique development, and that develop? ment alone that Marx established the catego? ries and process which Djurfeldt and Lindberg inappropriately apply to Indian history in order to support their caste-to-class argument. The changes in landownership which did occur with British imperialism imply neither inevit? able evolution of modes of production nor in? evitable differentiation of class out of caste. As we will note shortly, this class-caste distinction distorts rather than explicates the social life of Thaiyur. The "progressive historical" interpretation has little relation to reality, but it is part and parcel of Djurfeldt and Lindberg's wholehearted acceptance of the 1950's model of the Indian village as self-contained and stable with a rigid</page><page sequence="13">117 jajmani and varna social order. This, in turn re? sults in their interpretation of the contempo? rary situation which they see as static "under development" [ 102]. Indeed, their own ana? lysis merely substitutes "underdevelopment of labour" for "jajmani" as the equilibrium fac? tor in village economies. For all their abstract recognition of the village being part of a wider capitalist network, their own model of the vil? lage suspiciously resembles that of the ethno? centric ethnographers they criticize [103]. In contemporary South India, Djurfeldt and Lindberg conceive of class consciousness as distorted, "seldom expressed in pure form" [104] because it is mystified by jati ideology [ 105]. This ideology is said to be Brahmanical sociology and Louis Dumont's work on Indian culture is said to be no more than an advocacy of Brahmanical oppression-reflecting ideology [ 106]. When Djurfeldt and Lindberg encounter expressions of caste solidarity in Thaiyur, they consider these to be modern day occurrences of "false consciousness" about the nature of the social system. Thus all mention of caste emancipation movements are reduced to mysti? fication of the "real" power relations of the village [107]. Djurfeldt and Lindberg's attack on Dumont brings to the fore a critical issue, evident in both ethnographic analysis and in general social science models, of non-Western socio-cultural systems: the question of valid categories for analysis. Djurfeldt and Lindberg claim that Dumont merely adopts an oppressive Brah manic sociology as a "theory of the caste sys? tem". They write: Our distinction between three different levels, those of kinship, (endogamy), economy, and ideology, is blurred in Dumont's universe. ...Dumont denies the pos? sibility of a historical-materialist interpretation of the caste system: The ritual hierarchy cannot be seen as determined, even in the last instance, by an economic structure functioning as its basis [ 108]. Clearly Djurfeldt and Lindberg have misunder? stood Dumont's intention which was to un? cover the indigenous logic of the social and cultural systems - that is, the cultural meaning of the order, regardless of the origins and the function of such a logic. Dumont does not blur domains, rather he reveals animating values which he believes organize and articulate do? mains [ 109]. One may argue with his choice and limitation of organizing principles but his project is clear. This critique of Djurfeldt and Lindberg should not be taken as a defense of Dumont. There are serious problems with his structuralist approach. It is reductionism of another sort, reifying his own interpretation of a pan-Indian cultural logic. However, it is use? ful to examine Djurfeldt and Lindberg's attack on Dumont as it reveals the shortcomings of their own position. Djurfeldt and Lindberg proceed to dispute Dumont on the relation between the two highest varna in the system, Brahman and Kshatriya. According to Dumont this is a hier? archical opposition exemplifying the series of oppositions throughout the levels of the sys? tem which define the system as such. But ac? cording to the Swedish Marxists the varna system is "strongly reminiscent of the Euro? pean estate system" [110]. They proceed to compare India to "tributary societies" and finally decide that in medieval India, out of which the Brahmanical sociology suddenly arose without a past, The situation was similar (to that) during the classical feudal period in Europe. Under such circumstances, the king cannot be deified, only the kingdom can be! For this task, "deificators" are needed, and their in? fluence must be more than local... No wonder that all kings favoured the Brahmins [111] (parenthesis mine). The notion of jati continues to exist in con? temporary India because the ideas "are deve? loped and propagated by priests dominating the ideological apparatus" [112]. Thus, despite the fact that the jati system has allegedly suc? cumbed to class society, jati ideology is still a dominant axis of status differentiation because of the power of the priests and the power of maya (illusion or false consciousness). It is important to note the explanation of indige? nous categories with constant reference to</page><page sequence="14">118 European history. This mode of analysis is pervasive in their writing and is specifically linked to their methodology: verstehen is just preliminary while the real explanation lies in fitting the situation to simplisticly-used Marxist categories. Djurfeldt and Lindberg's rejection of Dumont is predicated on the idealist-materialist axis [113]. This axis is not an appropriate measure of theoretical signifi? cance, as Marshall Sahlins recently pointed out: As for the charge of "idealism" that an insistence on the meaningful appears to invite, this ... must take its ground in precisely the kind of preanthropological, presymbolic epistemology of subject/object relations whose transcendence was the historical condition of a concept of culture... Here was the specifically anthropological contribution to the established dualism: a tertium quid, culture, not merely mediating the human relation to the world by a social logic of significance, but constituting by that scheme the rele? vant subjective and objective terms of the relationship [114]. In short, Djurfeldt and Lindberg's material/ class?ideal/caste axis of analysis is pre-sym bolic, conveniently ignorant of the cultural quality of human existence at one moment of the analysis only to blackmarket it later. Dumont's work is an attempt to discover a symbolic logic ? the charge of idealism parti? cipates in an archaic anthropology. Contemporary Caste, Class, and Congenital Capitalism Given the fact that Thaiyur village is 89.6% Harijan, that they own "moat" of the land, that they constitute "many" of the "big" farmers [115], and that most of them help one another in agricultural production, cooperating, but using market transactions instead of simple labour exchange [116], Djurfeldt and Lindberg are hard-pressed to find class society and ex? ploitation there. Nevertheless they manage to do so by deploying the meager and unreliable (by their own word [117]) data which they do have. The people of the Thaiyur community are divided into eight classes on the basis of the amount of land they own, the manner in which they work the land and their "income" [118]. All of these figures are said to be unreliable yet they are used to create the model of the society and support all of the arguments con? cerning surplus value and exploitation. The eight class structure is "simplified" to a three class model of the structure of exploitation [119], and eventually this is reduced to two categories, the good guys and the bad guys [120]. This successfully obliterates the mani? fold nature of communication and exchange in Thaiyur panchayat. Amidst the exploitation-ratio charts for the eight, three, and two class structures, there is a quite crucial point that the ethnographers both admit and choose to ignore: most of the real individuals of Thaiyur panchayat fit into and are counted in more than one class. There is a critical overlap between those people the ethnographers choose to regard as exploiters and those they choose to regard as exploited. Djurfeldt and Lindberg admit that it is diffi? cult to label the villagers as members of distinct classes, yet they persist in a Leninist definition of class as a position and role in system of so? cial economy [ 121 ]. In the same way we noted how Althusser saw individuals as "supports" in the structure of production. With this under? standing, the Swedish ethnographers use class analysis as the backbone for their understand? ing of Thaiyur society, even to the point of contradicting themselves and stating that classes do in fact exist as real social statuses in Thayi yur [122] and not simply as abstract and ana? lytical categories. That there are rich and poor and that the poor are starving is not being called into ques? tion. What I am challenging is the reduction of this village's social organization to one axis of analysis which is believed to account for all be? haviour and beliefs. There is no doubt that in Thaiyur relations of dominance exist, but class is an irrelevant term where the status differen? tiation is based also on non-economic factors.</page><page sequence="15">119 Status may also vary by situation. There are clues throughout their studies to other axes of status determination: farmer-coolie, caste identity, kinship, Hindu-Christian, age, perso? nal attributes [ 123]. All of these occasions for status differentiation are ignored by Djurfeldt and Lindberg. When they appear to be active in some context, they are consistently dis? missed as "false consciousness". For example, kinship is said to hide the "real basis of power" [124], and kinship rituals are "ideology mate? rialized" as "false consciousness" [125]. Thus the expressed cognitive categories of social life in Thaiyur are evaded or obliterated. All of this is not to say that exploitation does not exist in Thaiyur, but it does not exist as a universal abstract category. Exploi? tation must be defined relative to each partic? ular socio-cultural formation, as Marx indi? cated. Exploitation is not only an economic fact; it is a cultural experience. Djurfeldt and Lindberg never clearly establish who is ex? ploiting whom and how because their class analysis succeeds in blurring the on-the-ground social relations, and the cultural meaning of the communications and exchanges which oc? cur in Thaiyur, a problem which I shall now examine. Exploitation and Cooperation: Blackmarketing Culture There are many types of labour exchange in Thaiyur's agricultural production. Besides family labour, there are some sharecroppers and permanent farm servants (padiyal). These are said to amount to a very small percentage [ 126]. If one carefully examines the infor? mation that Djurfeldt and Lindberg provide on labour-exchange, a fact of critical signifi? cance emerges: every farmer, from small to large landowner, seems to need to hire wage labour to help him in cultivation [127]. This is the case not only for technical reasons: They seem to do so, both for technical and social rea? sons... But to a certain extent it has also become a norm to hire labourers for what society defines as team tasks. The norm is not strictly enforced, but those small farmers who comply with it are regarded as generous men by their neighbors, while those who deviate are re? garded as misers. The temptation to break the norm is greatest for a small farmer... Still not even a very small cultivator can manage entirely without hiring labourers [128]. And who are these wage labourers that even very small farmers must hire for both techni? cal and cultural reasons?: ... small farmers constitute a considerable part of the wage labour force... But much wage-labour is employed by the small farmers themselves. So the end result is that small farmers work as coolies for each other [129]. As Djurfeldt and Lindberg rightly observe, this is no more than an exchange of labour function? ing through the market [130]. With such an overlap of roles, and with no precise figures on who employs whom for how much, it is very difficult to go along with Djurfeldt and Lindberg in conceptualizing this as a class struc? ture replete with exploitation. They acknowl? edge that such reciprocal exchange is not exploita? tion, but the categories of "wage-labourer," "big landowner," and "small landowner," are used to establish that Thaiyur is a class society. It becomes obvious that when the roles of farmer and wage-labourer are held by the same people, and when cooperation is a cultural value, it serves no useful analytic function to speak of class in Thaiyur. As for exploitation, Djurfeldt and Lindberg write: ... the social relation between the small farmer and his hired labourers is quite another than that between the rich farmer and his coolies. The former are equals, today they are employer-employee, tomorrow the relation may be reversed....It is different when the same small farmers work as coolies in the fields of a rich farmer. Then they toil beside each other, and the employer stands at the bund of the field, shouting orders and watching them... In this case the employment is not reciprocal and there? fore the employer-employee relation is one of exploita? tion, and a class-relation [131]. Calling the workers "hired labourers" when they toil for the smaller farmer and "coolies" when they work for a larger farmer does not in itself constitute the grounds to consider</page><page sequence="16">120 the latter exploitation. Nor does the lack of reciprocity in itself establish this. (Indeed, this is merely asserted next to a statement that reciprocity is the norm. There is no data on the extent of employment of whom by whom.) Further, the employer, be he small or large, must supervise the employees [ 132]. The critical question thus becomes one of comparative wages. We are given no accurate data on this. Nor again are we given accurate data on the relative distribution of land. (By their own word, it is "our own unreliable cen? sus data" [ 133].) This lack makes it hard in? deed to establish the existence, let alone the nature, of class relations and exploitation in Thaiyur. If the wage scales are comparable (as they imply), then a lack of reciprocity could be based on a wide variety of cultural deter? minants. The most curious element in this whole ana? lysis is the manner in which culture is literally "blackmarketed". At earlier moments in this study we noted how ideas were dismissed as ideology and hence as "false consciousness". Yet here in the midst of their analysis of la? bour relations, the cultural value of coopera? tion is smuggled in, covered with "the formal imprint of the dominant capitalism" [ 135], and marketed in juxtaposition to "shouting" to prove that the big farmers are exploiters. Such a selective use of culture points to the need for better integration of cultural analysis as a component in any Marxist anthropology. Land and Class: Blackmarketing Culture, Part 2 Land is said to be the actual basis of the class-structure [ 136]. We are therefore led to inquire just what does landownership and land cultivation mean in Thaiyur? [ 137]. Djurfeldt and Lindberg do not address these questions but in the course of reporting informants' re? sponses to other questions, certain indigenous notions about land and land cultivation appear. One informant states:^ Actually, I don't find any profit in tilling this land. I'm doing it just to keep up my prestige. If I don't grow paddy, people will say: 'Oh, he is not able to farm his land. He can't keep up the traditions from his father'. So, only in order to keep the good name of my family, am I culti? vating this poor soil [138]. Another informant, with very little land, is asked why he has purchased bullocks when it is not very profitable for so small a landowner. The farmer replies, after giving some utilitarian reasons: And it is considered prestigious to own bullocks. Only then will I be considered a real farmer. Otherwise people will think I am only a coolie [139]. There is obviously a very high cultural valua? tion, above and beyond the economic value, both on owning land arid on being a cultiva? tor of land. We are led to ask what does being a "farmer" as opposed to being a "coolie" mean in this village? It is obviously not simply a question of owning land, nor of the quan? tity of land one owns. The reduction of the person to roles in a class structure all but oblit? erates even the possibility of asking such a question. Djurfeldt and Lindberg only see the "sound economic reasons," for example, in owning animals. But for this informant, being a "real farmer" is symbolized by owning those bullocks in a way that his small landholding by itself does not. There are elements of sta? tus, prestige, and identity here that are ani? mated by a cultural logic of which the current Marxist analysis seems unaware. Nevertheless, the cultural value of land and land-cultivation is used, i.e. blackmarketed, in the analysis when it is convenient to the argument: The "petty landlord" is not an uncommon figure, but most small landowners prefer to cultivate their land themselves. The reason seems to be that small land? lords are often cheated by their tenants. Moreover, social norms prescribe self-cultivation... [140]. In this type of explanation the ethnographer first plays the "straight" Marxist market of looking for utilitarian reasons why certain behaviour occurs. When, and only when, they</page><page sequence="17">121 appear insufficient or inadequate, does the ethnographer turn to the darkened recesses of the culture bazaar to pick up an idle expla? natory norm or two on the blackmarket. This is obviously connected to a methodology in which understanding the indigenous categories is considered simply a "preliminary" step to a science in which the ethographer always knows best. PEASANT RATIONALITY: THE SALT OF THE EARTH The local salt factory is said to be the key to understanding the Thaiyur economy [ 141 ]. It merits our close attention. Djurfeldt and Lindberg approach the salt workers as a unique category, separate from the farmers. But in fact, the salt workers are farmers, working dur? ing the agricultural off-season [ 142]. The es? tablishment of categories despite the overlap is again in consideration of the Leninist/Alt husserian theory of positions (tr?jet) in the structure of production. This model leads the ethnographers to state that: The workers doing practically all work receive less than half the total income from production... Their daily wages hardly suffice to feed an ordinary family, and leave no margin to save for the slack season. Now we can better understand the role of the salt industry in the Thaiyur economy. Far from increasing the income of the rural proletariat, it has instead led to a decrease in real wage rates. Both salt and agricultural coolie wages are below those in the surrounding area. The net result is that, in order to survive, agricultural labourers and poor peasants have to work also in the salt fields, and thereby for a longer period, but not with a pro? portionate increase in the yearly wage... the whole economy, the wages, etc., have adjusted to a situation in which agriculture is complemented with salt pro? duction, and in which neither sector meets the full costs of reproduction of their labour force [ 143]. Yet it is abundantly clear even from the meager data provided that it is not at all a question of survival. The Harijans are working in the salt industry, in addition to farming, in order to earn money to buy land to be better farmers [ 144]. And, as the figures indicate, they are succeeding in doing just that. In the past 100 years the Harijans have managed to acquire most of the land of Thaiyur from the formerly big landowners, the Vellahas [ 145]. Most sig? nificantly, the salt factory began large-scale production with the completion of a critical canal between 1856 and 1860 [146], This parallels precisely the ethnographers' state? ments that the Harijans have been obtaining all their land in the past 100 years [ 147]. Thus the farmers' labour in the salt factory is, in most cases, not at all for survival, and "farmers" and "salt workers" are not separate categories, the intentionality of each being to provide a portion of a full year's living expenses. The deployment of "Marxian" categories distort the on-the-ground facts: farmers are working as workers in order to be greater farmers because farming is a strong cultural value. The relation between the salt and the earth is perfectly clear. Rationality, Irrationality and Underdevelopment The Thaiyur economy is said by the ethno? graphers to be in a state of "underdevelop? ment" due to a fundamental "irrationality" of the system as a whole [ 148]. The agents in the system however are said to be "rational" [ 149]. The system is said to be irrational be? cause of its inability to overcome class barriers in the interests of collective well-being. Djurfeldt and Lindberg write: ... the productive forces inherent in the co-operation between many labourers in the process of production., are totally undeveloped.... the productive capacities of the individual worker are far from utilized. With the prevailing crop pattern and methods of cultivation as main determinants of the labour input, the indivdual worker is employed only for part of the year [150]. Still, there are tasks crying to be done: improvement of irrigation works, sinking more wells, soil management, and conservation, etc. But these tasks require full co? operation by many labourers under the leadership of a motivated management. This underutilization of the productive forces of the "collective labourer" is the most blatant of all. We think that many of the symp? toms called "underdevelopment" can be attributed to this underutilization of labour [151].</page><page sequence="18">122 This underdevelopment of labour input is also said to be the cause of a massive "ecocrisis" in Thaiyur [152]. The root cause of the under? utilization of labour in Thaiyur is identified as the landownership pattern: We conclude, then, that the forces of production can be seen as contained by the relations of production, and that this containment explains the inability of the sys? tem to adapt itself to an increasing population, and to correct the ecological imbalances... [153]. It is critical to recall at this point that (1) farmers choose to work in the salt factories rather than work the land throughout the year, (2) the forces of production, i.e. the farmers, largely help each other during the agricultural season and this in no way can be generally construed as an exploitative relation? ship, (3) there is said to be an "oversupply" of labour during part of the year [154] which is not utilized in agriculture because the farmers will not cultivate at the time; the weather is not appropriate to the crops which Thaiyur farmers wish to grow, and the oversupply does not dispose toward collective labour for the common good. The ethnographers state the reason for this non-utilitarian attitude (by Western standards) is that collective labour: is "fundamentally inconipatible with the present social order" [155]. But the causes restraining labour input are cultural choices^ they are not based on irrational class interests. The ethno? graphers are presuming that rationality means the production of the maximum possible agri? cultural output [156]. They state that "there are no absolute ecological or technological bar? riers to an expansion of the productive forces in Thaiyur agriculture" [ 157]. But, as indi? cated above, there are cultural reasons which the presumption of restrained self-maximizing individuals reduces to class interests. If one attempts to understand the system in terms of the cultural significance of behaviour and ideas then Djurfeldt and Lindberg's "structure of underdevelopment" becomes a culturally meaningful order of production. To paraphrase Marshall Sahlins, the action and organization of production itself is symbolically determined [158]. Social norms do not operate as con? straints on production. They are production ? the production and reproduction of a socio cultural order. Thus, a system, by definition, cannot be "irrational", although it may well be exploitative. Kinship: Mystified Medium for Exploitation and Dominance Despite the fact that Djurfeldt and Lindberg reject Godelier's formulation of the relation between kinship and the economic do? main, they nevertheless utilize an inferior version of that very framework in their discus? sion of kinship in Thaiyur [ 159]. They claim that the kinship "idiom" hides the real nature of human relations in Thaiyur: "kinsmen often occupy antagonistic positions in relations of exploitation, but their 'fraternity' tends to gloss over the basic antagonism" [160]. Line? age is reduced to a "ceremonial function" [ 161 ]. The ethnographers write: ...the ideology materialized in kinship rituals is false consciousness. The lineage is projected as an exoga mous brother-hood (pangali) and, since isogamy and generalized exchange imply equality in status between the exogamous brotherhoods, the entire bilateral kin? dred stands out as a community of equals. This is false consciousness, as is evident when the rules are confronted with their results. Although the rules are isogamous, the search for marriage partners which are equal in status leads to an internal subdivision of the caste into smaller segments separated by virtual but unrecognized barriers of endogamy [162]. While there is some truth in this statement, the complexity of the relationship between equali tarianism and hierarchy as organizing principles cannot be so smoothly reduced to true and false consciousness; the question of cultural logic is also involved. But further, a native in? formant explains why such lineages do even? tually publicly split: - Lineages often split when they no longer consist of only tayadi.</page><page sequence="19">123 - Is there any maximum size for a lineage? - Yes, the lineage will naturally split. The members will multiply. They can't stick together. There may be hundreds of families. Who can manage that? [163]. Both the reduction of the lineage to a "cere? monial function," and kinship to "false cons? ciousness" is directly related to the fact that the ethnographers unwittingly take the nuclear family as the basic cross-culturally universal category [164]. Thus, this unit is said to be "subordinated to the wider kinship system," but "not stressed in ideology" [165]. Finally, on the relation of kinship to politics, Djurfeldt and Lindberg write: ...kinship serves as an "idiom" in which power relations can be conceived and expressed. But kinship is not the basis of those power relations. On the contrary, kinship serves to hide the real basis of power in the very process (of bringing) power into consciousness [166]. In short, kinship as a meaningful and motivat? ing system of symbolic behaviour is considered to have no legitimacy on its own. Only the nu? clear family is properly the domain of kinship. All else is ideology, false consciousness, idiom. In this particular species of ethnographic prac? tice, then, the theoretical call for the mainte? nance of the relative autonomy of superstruc tural domains is a casualty to vulgar materialst reductionism. Tradition: The Stagnation and Sorcery of the Eco? nomic Base Djurfeldt and Lindberg's treatment of the religious life of Thaiyur heirs to the mechani? cal materialist orientation. They speak of reli? gion as an "illusion," "spontaneously created by thought" [ 167], as well as "false conscious? ness" which legitimates the existing social order [ 168]. One presumes that such sponta? neity of thought is also false consciousness. Without going into detail it is sufficient to say that in the ethnographers' interpretation, God is the Celestial Patron, temples are "in? vestments" [ 169], the diversity of religious beliefs is a "religious division of labour" [ 170], and "religious medical systems" serve "prac? tical functions" [171]. In one of the few lengthy pieces of ethnographic reporting, the researchers describe an Adi Kappu ceremony which is complete with puja (worship), goddess possession, and sacrifice. The ethnographers conclude that the ceremony is a false expres? sion of caste solidarity and equality when "in reality, the Paraiyan are not equal" [172]. They also attribute to the ceremony a second function: "a latent function in the washing away of sins". A sin according to the ethno? graphers, being any transgression of the proper social order: the ceremony of dipping the wives' hands in the slaughtered animals' blood absolves disconformity [173]. According to this interpretation, the fact that it is only the wives who perform the absolving act is said to mean that they represent the commu? nity. All personal motives relevant to, and indigenous cultural explanations of, the cere? mony are left unreported. The richness, depth, and significance of the ritual, its constituted meanings are ignored. As a final example, I note what Djurfeldt and Lindberg say of informants' statements about the climate of Thaiyur. They write: People in Thaiyur tend to see these fluctuations as brought about by suprahuman forces: but their fitful ness are not unrelated to human activities, as explained by the postmaster: I haven't seen such a drought since my childhood...In olden days our ancestors used to worship the Moon and the Sun, and keep them in reverence. But now, man has set his foot upon the moon...Now Nature feels ashamed when Man has come up to Her level and imitated Her. So the rains which were to our benefit have stopped falling. And today man has even ventured to make artificial rains. You see, those things are disgraceful to God who created Nature. I think that is the reason for the monsoon fail? ures. But we also met with other, and more secular theo? ries. One old man attributed the monsoon failure to the many newly dug wells... Both theories are false... [174]. The ethnographers then explain how, like all false consciousness, these theories do grasp a</page><page sequence="20">124 small element of the ecological truth that man's exploitation of the environment is to some degree responsible for the monsoon's failure. Here cultural logic is reduced to the poorly transmitted messages of the Eco-Mind. Djurfeldt and Lindberg's statement that "social life is a part of Nature" again reflects a presymbolic anthropology [175] in which traditions are never legitimate in their own right. At the same time, it denies the dialectic between culture and nature so deeply em? bedded in the Marxist tradition; not to speak of Marx's focus on the dynamics of social life which he explicitly stated were neither ana? logous to, nor a part of nature. The Ethnographic Praxis of Structural Marxism In their theoretical models, Althusser and Godelier give a good deal of consideration to structural limits, reciprocal determination, and contradiction. Yet both theorists have a hard time dealing with social change. This dilemma emerges clearly in ethnographic praxis. In Djurfeldt and Lindberg's analysis popu? lation growth is regarded as one of the mecha? nisms of social change in the past [ 176]. They seem to hope that it may again be in the future [ 177]. The structural contradictions and in? compatibilities categorized in the ethnography as the irrationality of the system are considered to be within the limits of structural invariance, though they border on an ecological disaster. The ethnographers conclude that the contem? porary situation is one of stagnation and will be until a revolution occurs [178]. I noted that in the structural Marxist theory itself there are tendencies to reduce culture to ideology or to subsume it under structure. In ethnographic praxis we have seen these ten? dencies manifest in both aspects. There is a consistent reduction of culture to false con? sciousness and ideology in Djurfeldt and Lind? berg's monographs. A second aspect of this first tendency is the blackmarketing of culture when it proves convenient. At that moment of the analysis, culture is brought in as an explanation or associated factor of a more basic causal determinant of some aspect of the social formation; culture is never accepted or understood as an explanation of behaviour or institutions in and of itself. The second ten? dency, to subsume culture in structure, is manifest in this ethnography by the presump? tion that the structure of the productive rela? tions and the level of the productive forces are "underdeveloped". The cultural premises and organization on which the underdeveloped mode of production rest are taken as a "given". Class is criticized as constraining production but culture is merely considered the armament of class relations, and not as a critical factor in the determination of the existing mode of production. Finally, on the relations between domains in in a society, despite pronouncements to the contrary, it appears that the notion of relative autonomy within "determination in the last instance" reduces itself in ethnographic praxis to a vulgar materialist position of determina? tion of the superstructural forms and articula? tions by class relations based on landowner ship. The mutual conditioning aspect stressed by Djurfeldt and Lindberg in their theoretical introduction is not followed through in the analysis. This is no accident. Thus far, it has been the tendency of such underdeveloped theories to buckle in analytical use under the weight of ethnographic diversity, and to col? lapse into mechanical modes of analysis which do violence to the integrity of alien institu? tions, behaviour patterns, and symbolic systems. NOTES 1 I must stress here that I am not intending to explicate what I think Marx said about social change. I only wish to analyse some of his ideas as interpreted by Althusser, Balibar and Godelier. Due to time and space limitations I will not cover Meillassoux, Rey or Terray in this essay.</page><page sequence="21">125 2 For the most part Althusser and Balibar will be treated as a single unit.

There he states that it is the history of the social formation, specific? ally the class struggle, which reproduces the mode of production on which it rests (pp. 239, 245). The articulation of this with aspects of the earlier position are underdeveloped while the revised formulation it? self still partakes of some of the theological problems of the old one. Althusser makes essentially the same revisions to his theory in his latest statements in Essays in Self-Criticism (London: New Left Books, 1976), pp. 130, 141, 150, 183, 185.
