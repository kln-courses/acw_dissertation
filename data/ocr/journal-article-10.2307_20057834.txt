<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fourth Critique Horst Ruthrof " M ^l CLECTiciSM is the degree zero of contemporary culture," says l-^ Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. His remark is pertinent too to the ^ ^ question of interpretation, for what methodological guidance do we have left once interpretive coherence has lost its legitimation and the signified itself has dissolved in the abyss of mere signifiers? With traditional bodies of learning discredited, "knowledge" is indeed "the stuff of TV game shows."1 Nevertheless, we may discover in this situation an emancipatory impulse. Perhaps what is emerging is a more demo cratic interpretive practice with broadly liberating consequences. For the loathing of interpretive coherence and the celebration of the signifier may very well herald an escape from the fetters of the transcendental signified, structure, techno-logos, and from all kinds of ontic and epistemic certitudes. If this is so, how far can we pursue this double liberation without self contradiction and the violation of principles endemic to language and reading? Is it possible to interpret without any kind of coherence? And is it possible in principle to separate the signifier from the signified while still producing signification? In other words, could we even leave behind that minimal coherence of the linguistic sign that has tradition ally guaranteed conceptuality? Would then all interpretation practice based on the directionality of the linguistic sign be badly misguided? If coherence, even in the modest heuristic forms this essay advocates, could be abandoned and the signified relegated to the garbage bag of iconic illusions, we would indeed have reached a significant turning point. It would rival the revolutionary moment of Kant's Critique of Judgment and could perhaps be rightly called the birth of the Fourth Critique. By this I do not mean such attempts to refine the Kantian insights as for example Wilhelm Dilthey's striving for a Critique of the human sciences.2 However sophisticated Dilthey's analysis of the difference between the natural sciences and the humanities looks if compared, say, with C. P. Snow's argument in Two Cultures, Dilthey fails to rise to the heuristic challenge that lies at the center of Kant's work.3 To be sure, he is not the only theorist who yields to the pressure of positivist historiog Neiu Literary History, 2004, 35: 233-258</page><page sequence="2">234 NEW LITERARY HISTORY raphy even while opposing it. I suggest that the entire secular herme neutic tradition from Ast and Schleiermacher to Gadamer, instead of pursuing the liberating, centrifugal impulses of the Critique of Judgment, consolidated the part-whole relations of reading towards its center and so produced a reproductive rather than exploratory hermeneutics. This is why Heidegger as late as 1926 could do no more than introduce the two-dimensional and static metaphor of the "hermeneutic circle" to describe the process of understanding as interpretation.4 The Fourth Critique then must look laterally for inspiration. It can draw on such advances in interpretation during the last century as the theorization of defamiliarization and intertextuality (Russian Formal ism), alterity (Husserl, Levinas), dialogism (Bakhtin); paradigmatic syntagmatic analyses (Saussure, Jakobson), the role of the reader (Ingarden, Eco); psychoanalytic readings (Freud, Lacan), the critique of phallocentrism and gendered reading (Kristeva, Irigaray, Cixous); cul tural critique (Adorno, Horkheimer) ; universal pragmatics and commu nicative action (Habermas); genealogy and pragmatics (Foucault); deconstruction and presence (Derrida); postcolonial critiques (Said, Bhabha); the agonistics of discourse (Lyotard); or the theorization of the "everyday" (Schutz, de Certeau, Bourdieu). Significantly, none of these theories was generated in the empiricist tradition, all having developed ideas made thinkable in the post-perspectival world unveiled by Kant, whether by continuing or opposing that heritage. Each of those theories, and one could add several others, fleshes out the theoretical potential of epistemic projection. The Fourth Critique then would be a collective, contemporary paradigm of reading, an inclusive enterprise characterized by the minimum requirement of heuristic coherence, avail able as a well-stocked tool kit for the exploration of meaning within complex phenomena. There are two topical claims, however, that appear to be incompatible with this paradigm, denying as they do the very ground of interpretation. One is that signifiers can somehow mean by themselves; the other, that it is possible to jettison coherence altogether. I will address these two vexing issues in more detail below. If secular hermeneutics has failed to recognize the potential of Kant's contribution, what then is the revolutionary moment in the Third Critique} Were we to regard, as does Lyotard, the progress through Kant's three Critiques as one from sickness to sanity, we would fail to take seriously enough the movement from relatively simple forms of judg ment to interpretive complexities.5 Towards the end of the Critique of Pure Reason Kant takes a hard, "critical" look at his analysis and discovers that "perhaps the sole use of all philosophy of pure reason" is only "negative."6 Far from extending philosophy, he sees it now as "a discipline for the limitation of pure reason" which, far from "discovering</page><page sequence="3">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 235 truth," only has "the modest merit of guarding against error" (A795; B823). Reason now "has no dictatorial authority; its verdict is always simply the agreement of free citizens, of whom each one must be permitted to express, without let or hindrance, his objections or even his veto" (A738f; B766f). This, then, qualifies formal and mathematical procedures (deductive reason) and their application to the phenomenal world (inductive reason). Contrary to popular assumptions, linking general truth claims with Kant is no longer an option, restricted as truth now is to formal systems. In the Critique of Practical Reason the discursive formation of judgment looks a little like the application of a formal rule, a measuring tape for phenomena as it were, except that the phenomena are no longer those of nature but of society.7 The social definitions of moral rules can be applied to human acts, their transcendental reduction producing the "categorical imperative." In this, the practical reason of the Second Critique stands between the two other Critiques, combining as it does the rules of a defined system, qualified by the use of empirical concepts, with the complexities of the social world. Readers who approach the Third Critique via Derrida's The Truth in Painting may get the impression that Kant is concerned in some way with truth. But this is not the case; we look in vain for any veridical discourse.8 To do so is a common mistake which, I think, stems from idealist readings of the earlier Critiques. The absence of truth from the Third Critique is crucial. Perhaps Rant did not want to be blamed by Hegel for having succumbed to a "Bacchantian trance."9 When Derrida, in "Struc ture, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," distin guishes between "two interpretations of interpretation," one which wants to "decipher truth" and one which affirms "play," he is distancing his own practice from the hermeneutic tradition.10 However, Kant's own position in the Critique of Judgments not well described by either option. There is no truth or transcendental signified at the end of Kant's heuristic telos, nor could we loosen reflective reason itself to the point of "play." Rather, the critical-speculative stance excludes these two ex tremes and instead establishes the conditions for interpretation between them. Deciphering truth is ruled out categorically in the reflection on complex phenomena because it would have to rely on the "dogmatic" application of "determining reason" legitimate only in deductive and, with certain reservations, in inductive operations.11 Affirming play, on the other hand, is limited to a certain extent by the object of study as the interpretation unfolds and also, as will be seen presently, by the boundaries of community expectations. Instead of truth, we are dealing here with interpretation as a way of exploring a double, relational instability, that of any specific part and that of the whole. It is to the</page><page sequence="4">236 NEW LITERARY HISTORY judgment of large-scale, complex systems without the help of stipulative or determining rules that the Critique of Judgment addresses itself. The practice targets here are art and nature. To mark the difference in the kind of reasoning required under these more complicated circum stances, Kant uses the terms reflective reason and ideological judgment This, I suggest, is a path-breaking innovation for the following reasons. While in the other Critiques at least one side of the judgment equation is given, in the Critique of Judgment Kant introduces a discursive forma tion in which neither the subject term nor the predicate is secured. While in deductive (pure) reason both subject and predicate are resolved by recourse to definition, in inductive (synthetic a priori or applied deductive) procedure a given formal rule is applied to empirical facts, and in practical reason a stipulated moral rule is applied to the interpreted fact of a human act, reflective reason invents both its rule and the frame within which the judgment is to be regarded as valid, that is, attuned to community expectations or sensus communis (156-60). Instead of slotting specific observations into a pre-given scheme, the reflective judgment invents a general law suitable to the interpretation of specifics. This reversal was what inspired Charles Sanders Peirce to speak of abduction,12 a variant of Kant's rule: "die reflektierende Urteilskraft soll unter ein Gesetz subsumieren, welches noch nicht gegeben" [reflective judgment is to subsume under a law that is not yet given] (312). In other words, we must invent the rules of interpretation as we go along. To achieve the flexibility he required for his teleological reason Kant transformed the Aristotelian ontic telos, the master plan of the universe, into the dynamic telos of an interpreted, phenomenal world. Phrased in Kant's epistemic terms, the Aristotelian telos is noumenal, the new dynamic variety is phenomenal; it pertains, that is, to the way the human species is able to cognize the world. When we wish to judge particulars within the complexity of nature, Kant says, we can do so only if we have an appropriate frame. Yet since no such frame of interpretation is pre given, we have to invent a purposiveness, and to proceed as if we knew the systemic coherence of nature as a whole. There are two important insights here: one is that the judgment of any phenomenon needs to be embedded in a large configuration (heuristic coherence of necessity) ; the other is that of creativity. We cannot simply read the reflective telos off the complexities; we impose it as a "spin" on the data. Here we have passed from the critical to the speculative-critical Kant and to the revolutionary moment of the Third Critique: there is no limit to the kind of framing conditions we wish to project for our interpretations, as long as they allow for the kind of phenomena we think constitute the whole. Each interpretive frame is merely heuristic, it is invented in order to allow us to proceed with our forever provisional reading. This applies to both</page><page sequence="5">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 237 the judgment of nature and works of art, except that in art we do not foreground practical application, whereas scientific theory rightly con tinues to project ever new frames with justified expectations of predict ability and practical use. We can now abstract from Kant's two main examples, art and nature, to the level of large-scale phenomena in general. At this level what remains of the principles of interpretation in art and nature is the heuristic form {"ein heuristisches Prinzip") of the reflective judgment (355). Kant's heuristic emphasis required the redefinition of the Aristotelian telos. In pre-Kantian philosophy telos refers to the ontic master plan of the universe; Kant's epistemic perspective disallows such noumenal certitude. Not that he doubts that there is a master plan; he does not. But we cannot know what portion of our description is attributable to our human perspective and what belongs to the much maligned Ding an-sich. What kind of telos then is this? It is epistemic rather than ontic, forever changing rather than given, a function of our interpretive decisions as much as of the objectivity of nature. Epistemic telos is the projection of a frame within which the details of complex systems become intelligible as interrelated entities. While the Aristotelian, ontic version of telos is able to rely on "determining" or subsumptive reason, Kant's telos employs "reflective reason" which does not make any definitive claims but rather functions as a "regulative principle of cognition," permitting the imposition of order on what would otherwise remain for us chaotic (312). Since we are missing "the key" to such large scale phenomena as nature, the relations so ordered are "regulative" relations relative to an interpretive scheme (387). Reflective reasoning under its projected telos can be no more than a "Leitfaden," a guiding thread for the invention of "a kind of causality" in order to make complex phenomena "erklaerbar" (explainable) or, more precisely, "erkennbar" (cognizable) (301, 309, 307). However, this is not an "objective claim," as it would be in the domain of determining reason. For if we were to apply determining reason to such large-scale systems as nature, we would be guilty of a "dogmatic" use of concepts (329). Reflective reason, for Kant, kicks in when we wish to speculate on coherence in the absence of adequate experience (332). We are in no position to observe nature's purposes as "intentional" or as a closed system and so cannot proceed deductively. What we can do is speculate, that is, reflect on its possible coherence. Kant insists that "the one manner of explanation [reflective] excludes the other [determin ing]." This is why in the interpretation of complex systems we should replace "explanation," which is determining, by "exposition," its critical speculative alternative (356-57). Since neither the observed detail of nature itself nor its stipulated frame allows us to arrive at an "objective"</page><page sequence="6">238 NEW LITERARY HISTORY overall picture, reflective judgment and its associated telos are "valid" only "for us" (360). Our projection has subjective universality, a validity relative to a human community. Since in reflective reasoning both the subject side of the statement and its predicate are unstable, there is no ground for speculative-critical judgments "inside" the equation; its ground lies outside the discursive formations employed and indeed outside the subject performing the act of judging. It lies in the social, the sensus communis, the interpretive community (156ff.). This makes sense only if we remember Kant's distinction between two kinds of subjectivity, the merely subjective realm of likes and dislikes, and what he calls "subjective universality," better translated today as inter subjectivity. Subjective universality incorporates community expectations, as Kant illustrates when he speaks of the "expanded horizon," a judgment that anticipates and responds to the possible objections of our fellow citizens (158). These qualifications are essential ingredients of Kant's teleological procedure, without which such subreptions as Terry Eagleton's confusion of Kant's two kinds of subjectivity, for instance, are inevitable.13 Compressed into a formula, one could say that the Critique of Judgment redirects the interpretation of complex phenomena towards a critical speculative approach yielding epistemic and heuristic coherence. Re versing the perspective, we can view the sequence of the three Critiques as one that begins with the most complex and speculatively exploratory discourse in the Critique of Judgment, then moves towards the earlier Critiques by way of a reduction of the referential and deictic features of the discourse of judgment, until all that is left is its stripped, or formally empty, version called pure reason. From both perspectives the revolu tionary insight of the heuristic telos reveals itself as an invitation to liberate interpretive practices. What happened unfortunately was that less prom ising ingredients of the Critique of Judgment, such as beauty, taste, genius, and a distorted form of Kant's notion of subjectivity occupied center stage. By the time Hegel had finished the job the rigidity of an all encompassing pyramid of hierarchical order had replaced the abductive openness of Kant's interpretive scheme. Kant's virtual coherence of interpretive speculation was replaced by the authoritarian cohesion of a tomb.14 Coherence Phobia Coherence has been elegantly demolished by ?talo Calvino in his novel If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, in which both the ontic fabric of a hoped for fictional world and the epistemic skeleton of narratorial</page><page sequence="7">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 239 guidance are parodied.15 This, among other things, distinguishes his work sharply from another narrative often cited as typically postmodern, Don DeLillo's White Noise, in which the ruptured world of the toxic sublime contrasts with a highly traditional, almost eighteenth-century narratorial strategy.16 Here readers never lose their epistemic foothold. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between a world out of joint and its sure footed presentation has its comic reward: the readers are able to share in the narratorial sanity and ironic superiority that separates them from DeLillo's chaotic version of the contemporary world. On the other hand, no matter how successful we may find Calvino's novel, even his narrative labyrinth is ultimately tamed by the reader's will to impose a modicum of interpretive coherence on both his elusive narrators and his fractured world. Coherence phobia looms large in theories that have shaped the disciplines of the humanities and social sciences. We could say that Freud shifted the tectonics of theorizing most profoundly by shaking the foundations of judgment itself in his critique of subjectivity, while Jacques Lacan has narrowed the critique to a focus on language. For Lacan, "language is the condition of the unconscious;" there is "no unconscious without language." Inversely, anything we observe about language will be affected by our fractured subjectivity.17 Lacan 's transfor mation of the Cartesian cogito to "I think where I am not" allows for neither an imaginable ego nor the projection of a world.18 Alienated from ourselves from the start, in a new version of original sin, we do not cohere as linguistic beings. Following Freud, Lacan notes that "the subject is not one who knows what he is saying."19 If the signified can no longer function as an important element in language, we are unable to theorize human perspectives even in a heuristic way. In so far as Lacan 's observations about language are restricted to psychoanalysis, they undoubtedly enrich interpretation. However, Lacan 's is a much bolder claim. It is our ruptured unconscious that is the very condition of language and its discipline: linguistics. As many critics have noted, Lacan has introduced us to the not so obvious fact that psycho analysis implies a theory of language. This generalized claim is radicalized in Anaika Lemaire's introduction to Lacan, where she robs the reader of the last hope for a signified, Lacan 's point de capiton. She notes that every single word "implies a series of references to other words . . . both synonyms and antonyms, so that one could go right through the dictionary and still come up with a tautology." This is the popular chess game metaphor in which language is waiting in vain to be linked in some way to a secondary system for its semantic values. "In the synchronie structure of language, the anchoring point is mythical." This is so, explains Lemaire, because the "final signified for which one</page><page sequence="8">240 NEW LITERARY HISTORY searches is radically excluded from thought as it concerns an incommensu rable dimension, namely the Real."20 Her collapse of the phenomenal into the noumenal is a pre-Kantian error shared by much current theorizing. Nor does one have to be a hard-headed realist to balk at this claim. What about a provisional signified? And how could technical language ever function with such detours through dictionaries? No doubt, the infinite deferral of the "final" signified looks more promising when we try to explain interpretation in problematic texts, in film studies and psychoanalysis. But even there, infinite regress is hardly a practical reality beyond a Leibnizian sufficient reason. Does Lacan 's assurance help that "the diachronic function of this point de capiton is to be found in the sentence"?21 This too should be impossible in a radically syntactic theory, whether language is viewed synchronically or diachronically. Coherence thinking seems to have received another blow from Jacques Derrida's attack on presence in Western philosophy. Much of Derrida's deconstructive armor is tilted in support of this critique: his penchant for multiple mirrors,22 his infrastructures from diff?rance to metaphoricity, from hymen, trace, to pharmakon and supplementary, the notion of "essential"23 and "interminable drift,"24 his rejection of "violent hierarchies," or the idea that "the whole does nothing but begin."25 Yet since from a heuristic point of view the thing only emerges once we begin to interpret Derrida's remark here, as much of his other writing at the very least allows for the presupposition of heuristic constructivism. In "The Law of Genre" Derrida argues the impossibility of constrain ing our interpretation of literary texts by notions of genre. Reading Maurice Blanchot's narrative La folie du jour, he finds it "impossible to decide whether an event, r?cit, recit of event or event of recit took place. Impossible to settle upon the simple borderlines of this corpus, of this ellipsis unremittingly cancelling itself within it own expansion." So "it becomes difficult indeed to speak here with conviction about a recit as a determined mode." For Derrida, "all is recit and nothing is" and "the exit of the recit remains within the recit in a noninclusive mode." Derrida has made similar observations throughout his writings, as for instance in "Living on: Borderlines," where he describes the fictional text as "henceforth no longer a finished corpus of writing, some content enclosed in a book or its margins," but rather "a differential network, a fabric of traces referring endlessly to something other than itself."26 How success ful has Derrida been, then, in staving off generic constraints? As Ralph Cohen notes (with some satisfaction it seems to me), Derrida's "very attack falls within the genres of satire, parody, and literary theory" and, not surprisingly, "it is as a genre that parody displays itself in the playful/ serious text that Derrida has written."27</page><page sequence="9">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 241 A strong antitotality thesis has been put forward by Lyotard who associates the totalizing of grand and metanarratives with the false promise of instrumental reason and the Enlightenment ideology of progress that have led straight to Auschwitz. While Lyotard has been happy to adopt Kant's sublime, albeit in a politicized form, he insists that its zweckwidrige (literally, "opposed to its purpose") negative pleasure can be no more than moments of violent experience. What is theorized as a limiting case of cognition in Kant is now a prescription for political creativity which would "activate the diff?rends and save the honour of the name." This is why Lyotard's answer to the question "What is the postmodern?" is "war on totality."28 The Politics of the Signifier In DeLillo's White Noise a woman leaves a pharmacy, mumbling a string of chemical terms that mean nothing to her, a case of the pure signifier. The woman produces the Saussurean acoustic image but fails to combine it with the signified agreed upon, however vaguely, by the speech community. Unlike the reader, she fails to produce the "full" linguistic sign. This is precisely what the comic effect of DeLillo's prose relies on: the presentation of a person lost in the jungle of postmodern techno-logos. There is only rhyme, but no signified. So, if in a strict interpretation of the Saussurean sign the signified or concept is indis pensable for meaning and the process of understanding, why has the signifier been championed as "empty," "floating," "mere," or "hallucina tory"? Is there a technical misunderstanding? Or is there perhaps a counter theory that radicalizes Saussure 's opening gestures of structural ism? Perhaps the reasons are not to be sought at the level of linguistics at all but rather at the level of a certain politics. This, for example, is the charge made by Catherine Burgass who describes the "revelling in the signifier" as "irresponsible."29 One reason why the celebration of the signifier and the demise of the signified are so attractive may be the kind of apprehension described by Lyotard: "We have paid dearly for our nostalgia," he writes, for "a reconciliation of the concept and the sensible, for a transparent and communicable experience."30 Yet this "taking possession of reality" so feared by Lyotard is clearly not possible either linguistically or perceptu ally. After all, both linguistic and nonverbal readings are semiotic processes that make experience what it is: an interpretive filter. To go beyond that filter is to claim access to Kant's noumenon, the very condition of our never-ending perspectives. Neither word nor iconic representation can deliver such nostalgic goods. Paintings are no more</page><page sequence="10">242 NEW LITERARY HISTORY dangerous than poems. What is to be feared in representation is not the signified but the absence of critique, of skepticism, of negotiation, that is, the absence of competition between signifieds. Even so, there is no disputing the dominance in current theorizing of the linguistic signifier over the signified. Where does it come from? In his Course in General Linguistics Saussure lays down the law that "nothing is distinct before the appearance of language." It follows that when words fail us we must be at a loss how to orient ourselves in the world. We now know from neurological research that this is not so. It is precisely in areas of perceptual reality, where the text of natural language is thin or nonexistent, that our nonverbal grasp of our Umwelt is sharpened to the point of providing the subtlest distinction of taste, smell, touch, and emotions. To extend the claim to nonhuman organisms: Do we really believe that the tiger lives in a foggy world? In any case, Saussure 's "indefinite plane of jumbled ideas" does not seem to provide an adequate description of relationship between language and our percep tual readings.31 If our theorization of language lets go of the Kantian Anschauung (traditionally rather poorly translated as intuition but refer ring really to the perceptual or nonverbal grasp we share with other organisms?literally "looking-at"), we find ourselves in the idealist domain of a formal syntax unable to argue its relationship with the world. Saussurean linguistics has been troubled by idealization since its inception. Without Anschauung and Vorstellung (presentation as mental projection) our heuristic constructions amount to no more than formal schemes. Natural languages, however, while they are able to incorporate such empty schemata, can never be reduced to logical formality.32 The separation of linguistic and nonverbal semiosis that Saussure has legislated is at the base of his double arbitrariness thesis. Both signifier and signified are what they are only in relation to other values in the system. There is no dispute about Saussure 's claim that at both the level of the signifier and that of the signified we are dealing with systemic differential relations. What needs to be questioned now, partly as a result of neurological research into mapping, is the radical dissociation of the linguistic systems of signifieds from the nonverbal semiotics of our perceptual readings.33 That language as a meaning system should operate entirely arbitrarily with respect to perception is a tall order. At the level of the signifier Saussure has made a convincing case. At the level of the signified, the matter is open to debate. If a radical break did indeed exist between nonverbal semiosis and linguistic sign, translation between Chinese and, say, French would be impossible. We would have no level of comparison, no tertium comparationis, for testing our results. In true Saussurean fashion, two closed, differential systems of linguistic signs would stand side by side without any possible connection whatso</page><page sequence="11">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 243 ever. This is the ineluctable result of the chess game analogy of natural language. Of course, not all linguists have followed Saussure in this respect. Jakobson, for example, took the position that signs from different semiotic systems could be exchanged as long as they had a similar "signatum," that is, a compatible signified?* On this point, Jakobson stands closer to Peirce's semiotics. Peirce, however, goes much further than Jakobson by insisting that all human understanding depends fundamentally on iconic signification. "Every assertion" he writes, "must contain an icon or a set of icons, or else must contain signs whose meaning is only explicable by icons."35 And as human perception is well described as a series of iconic readings of our environment and ourselves, the Peircean position is irreconcilable with the structuralist picture of language. Since the Saussurean starting point, structuralist linguistics as well as some of its poststructuralist heirs have further diminished the role of the signified to the point where it has become irrelevant, leaving the signifier to carry semantic load. Lacan argues his rejection of the importance of the signified in language by way of an assumption that "the passage of man from nature to culture follows the same mathemati cal combinations which will serve later to classify and to explain."36 He speaks of a "primitive symbolism which is distinguished from imaginary representations" (209). Invoking Freud, the only remnant of human self-recognition in this calculus picture of evolution is "not what is expressed, but what is repressed" (209). Repression has now become the paradigm case of the concept. Avoiding the route of an unreliable signified, and pushing to one side the question "whether the symbolic is only the fantasy of imaginary capture taken to a second degree," Lacan opts for the cybernetic abstraction of "the symbol in its purest form." After all, "the wheel is not in nature." (What about tumbleweeds?) Lacan does, however, acknowledge "natural symbols," such as the "image of the human body," the sun and the moon. Paradoxically, it is these that give "the weight, the vital force, the emotional vibration to human language" (207-8). How could this be argued in terms of the signifier alone? Since capitonage never occurs, there is no escaping linguistic circularity. A theorist who has made a virtue of this kind of circularity is Ernesto Laclau theorizing the "empty signifier."37 Laclau starkly defines the empty signifier as "a signifier without a signified." He then proceeds to show that when we think the boundaries of the Saussurean differential system of language, we confront the breakdown of the linguistic sign, an imaginary line where the fundamental distinction between difference and identity can no longer be drawn. Beyond the system of differences lies the negativity of exclusion. And since "there is no direct way" of</page><page sequence="12">244 NEW LITERARY HISTORY signifying the real, we can only do so by the "subversion of the process of signification itself (39). But this is only so if we believe that the chess game of signifiers is dissociated from every other phenomenon outside the linguistic roundabout. Laclau's position denies the very likely possibility that humans function on the basis of an actual pragmatics which requires two concurrent signification systems, one of linguistic signifiers and another one that allows us to be in touch with our Umwelt by way of our sensory and emotional interpretations. Instead, Laclau holds the extreme structuralist position that whatever we are able to grasp happens by way of linguistic signs, the semantics or meaning system of which is likewise a self-sustaining matrix of differential relations. Only at the boundaries of that system are we able to sense that there is something else, which however we cannot grasp since it escapes linguistic signification. So all we are able to do at this limit is notice the breakdown of our understanding of both language and world. This position is as unlikely as it is fashionable. The apprentice who is trying to find his way about in an area of a machine that is out of sight and difficult to reach will let his fingers follow the shape of parts unfamiliar to him both as objects and technical terms. Lacking detailed linguistic signifiers, the apprentice may retreat to the safety of raw conceptual categories (signifieds), while his perceptual grasp will gain in precision as he allows his tactile readings to take shape in his mind. Not language, but perception is providing the lacking synaesthetic (rather than syneidetic) conceptualization.38 A similar process of meaning mak ing can be observed in the stark discrepancy between the paucity of our smell vocabulary and the precision of the perceptual olfactory nuances we are able to identify.39 In each case, we have reached the limit of our linguistic signifier-signified relation. As the number of signifiers shrinks to zero and their signifieds cease to yield mental material content, that is, as Laclau rightly says, become "empty," we turn to the more primitive semiosis of our perceptual faculties. No emptiness there, but rather the default signification provided by our nonverbal readings of the world. It is this crucial linkage that is missing in Laclau's analysis. An even more daring act is Baudrillard's, who has tried to theorize the case of a conceptually empty world. His universe of mere signifiers is the result of a four-step reduction. The traditional, reflected reality of mimesis, in which signifiers are cashed in for true signifieds, has given way to the distorted reality of signifiers with false signifieds, which in turn is replaced by a merely invented reality, where signifiers are conceptualized fictionally, before we reach the present stage of the simulacrum, a stage characterized by signifiers without signifieds, a stage at which conceptual reality is abandoned altogether. Baudrillard's fourth level, the world of the simulacrum, where we meet nothing but</page><page sequence="13">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 245 meaningless signifiers, is the radical extension of the Saussurean thesis concerning the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign. Since its moderate inception in Saussure 's lectures, the idea that the linguistic sign operates in a closed system of mutual, differential reference has undergone a gradual sharpening until the chess game analogy of natural language is now being taken for granted, now shrunk entirely to the level of syntax without semantics. In Baudrillard's later writings, we find ourselves in the rarified atmosphere of pure signifiers. Meaning is not only dead but "fatal," signification as we used to know it having suffered irreversible "entropy." As a result, "every event is today virtually inconsequential, open to all interpretations, none of which could determine its meaning: the equiprobability of all causes and of all consequences?multiple and aleatory imputation." Ironically, it is Baudrillard's belief in a liberated stream of bons mots cleansed of signifieds that trips him up. For, in natural language, signifiers themselves do not produce contradictions; only concepts can do that. On the one hand, Baudrillard describes the entire world as "a control screen," speaks of the possibility of a "strategic resistance" by the masses and promises a critique of the "orbital round of floating capital."40 But if we live in a world of mere simulacra, such meanings are no longer available. Without concepts, signifieds, we cannot conceive of anything, let alone a revolutionary practice. The irony is that Baudrillard's politics does constitute a coherent picture: a semantics denied by his conceptless semiotics. Infinite Regress Concept loathing and coherence phobia appear to have at least some of their roots in what one may wish to sum up under the term infinite regress. In The Limits of Interpretation Umberto Eco traces two traditions of interpretation driven by what he describes as "epistemological fanati cism." One aims at an essential meaning "independent" of our readings; the other favors "interpretation in infinite ways." The former, Eco associates with Aquinas and his idea of adequatio rei et intellectus, the latter with the Renaissance fashion of "hermetic" reading in which nothing is stable. Here interpretation is governed by the principle of similitude which produces "hermetic drift" of necessity since there is no logical limit to the kinds of similitudes we are able to imagine in reading.41 Eco's hermetic variety of reading is a special kind in a broader conception of infinite regress which I wish to sketch as background to our contemporary situation. The idea of infinite regress that still informs much of our thinking can be said to stem from Leibniz's description of two kinds of reason:</page><page sequence="14">246 NEW LITERARY HISTORY "sufficient" and "insufficient." In his Monadology he distinguishes be tween two ways in which we form reasoning chains.42 One is reasoning in defined systems, such as logic and mathematics; the other, reasoning about contingent facts around us. In the former, we can achieve not only definitional certitude but also, importantly, closure. Reason here suffices to bring the chain of signification to a complete and satisfactory conclusion, because "its reason can be found in analysis," that is, inside the significatory system. And for Leibniz, knowledge can be regarded as adequate when we have "completed" our analysis. The other kind of reasoning occurs when we pursue the way we think objects are linked with one another in the world around us. "Everything in nature," Leibniz observes, "proceeds ad infinitum." Here, "the suffi cient or final reason must be outside of the sequence or series of particular contingent things, however infinite this series may be." But since contingent truths "require an infinite analysis" and humans are incapable of accomplishing such a series, we should provide "at least some satisfactory or sufficient reason" why we argue the way we do. Leibniz cuts contingent reasoning short when he is satisfied that he has arrived at as good a justification as possible. "Where a perfect reason cannot be found" the pragmatics of sufficient reason comes to the rescue. This still reflects pretty well the situation of the everyday, where people opt for short explanations on practical grounds even if this violates the rules of logic. Kant pushes Leibniz's insufficient reason a significant step forward when he offers us his critique of the empirical and philosophical concept.43 Apart from "arbitrarily invented concepts" (A779; B757) our concepts are wobbly. As Kant observes, "an empirical concept cannot be defined at all, but only made explicit" (A727; B755). Likewise, "no concept given a priori, such as substance, cause, right, equity, etc., can strictly speaking, be defined" (A728; B756). And if "the limits of the concept are never assured" (A728; B756), then "the so-called definition is nothing more than a determining of the word" and "the completeness of the analysis of my concept is always in doubt" (A728; B757), whereby "completeness means clearness and sufficiency of characteristics" and "limits" refers to "the precision" we would achieve if there were no more "characteristics than belong to the complete concept" (A727n). This is why in the place of "definition" Kant prefers "exposition, as a more guarded term" (A729; B757). Infinite regress appears in many other guises, as for example in German Romantic poetics which regarded the "essence" of Romantic poetry as an eternal "becoming, never able to be completed." In semiotics, infinite regress makes its most forceful appearance in the writings of Peirce, who is associated with Kant in more ways than one: his</page><page sequence="15">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 247 idea of abduction, a creative move from particulars to the invention of a general law that caters for the isolated phenomenon, mirrors Kant's reflective reason; the necessity of a community for interpretation sharpens Kant's insistence on the sensus communis and the expanded horizon in judgment. Peirce's statements on infinite semiosis emphasize that each "interpr?tant" becomes "in turn a sign, and so on ad infinitum."44 As representation is made meaningful by yet another representation and so on, "there is an infinite regression here" (1.339) made up of "an infinite series of representations" (1.339). In addition, there is what I would call a lateral infinite regress amongst different sign systems, from iconic to symbolic signs and vice versa, by making signs from one system meaningful by signs in another, but always anchored by an iconic, that is a perceptual sign. Two powerful additions to the ubiquity of infinite regress are those made in the first half of the twentieth century by Kurt G?del and Werner Heisenberg. Since the ideas of both these theoreticians have been blunted during their passage into contemporary intellectual culture, I suggest we look at their original formulations. With reference to two formal systems, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell's Principia Mathematica and Zermelo-Fraenkel-von Neumann's axioms for set theory, G?del notes that "these two systems are so extensive that all methods of proof used in mathematics today have been formalized in them." One might therefore assume that "these axioms and rules of inference are also sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can in any way be expressed formally in the systems concerned." This, G?del shows, is not the case, and he demonstrates that "in both the systems mentioned there are in fact relatively simple problems in the theory of ordinary numbers which cannot be decided from the axioms." G?del stresses the point that "this situation is not due in some way to the special nature of the systems set up, but holds for a very extensive class of formal systems."45 It would be a mistake, frequently made, to conclude from this that G?del has destroyed coherence even where we thought it was unassailable, namely in formally constructed systems. Yet two-valued logic still applies; we can still perform arithmetic with ordinary numbers and decide on truth and falsity. It is at the level of proof that undecidability enters. What we have lost is absolute coherence; what we retain is heuristic coherence for specific purposes. Here too, as in Kant's dynamic telos, we proceed with our coherent projections in order to better understand, on the premise that all such interpretive schemes are epistemic tools rather than transcendental realities.46 An event that has had an indirect and yet pervasive impact on theorizing in the humanities is the so-called uncertainty principle. Again, it seems best to let its discoverer present his own case because of a small</page><page sequence="16">248 NEW LITERARY HISTORY but significant difference between his and other accounts. Heisenberg specifically restricts the fuzziness in the description of subatomic events to an unbridgeable "cut" (Schnitt) between the discourse of classical physics on the observer side and the formal language that describes the object relations in the atom. Heisenberg points to "a strange contradic tion" (Zwiespalt) in the description of what occurs: "On the one hand, the experimental questions which we ask nature are always formulated with the help of the imaginable concepts of classical physics, using especially the concepts of space and time of perception .... On the other hand, the mathematical constructs suited to the representation of experimental states of affairs are wave functions in multidimensional spaces of configuration that do not permit simple, imaginable interpre tation."47 As a result of this contradiction, Heisenberg speaks of "the necessity to make a cut in the description of atomic events between the measuring instruments of the observer, which are described by way of classical concepts, and the object of observation, the behaviour of which is represented by a wave function." What follows deviates somewhat from popular representations of Heisenberg's law. He insists that "on both sides of the cut, on the side of the observer, as well as on the side of the object of observation all relations are sharply determined?here by the laws of classical physics, there by the differential calculus of quantum mechanics." Nevertheless, the discrepancy or "cut" cannot be disputed because it can be demonstrated in "the appearance of statistical relations." For Heisenberg this distur bance "leads us to a barrier for the applicability of classical concepts." This barrier, the "so called relations of indeterminacy," limits the "degree of precision" which we can expect from classical descriptions in the subatomic domain. At the same time, "this limitation of precision" allows us to connect "particle and wave pictures," a linkage not permis sible in the formulations of quantum mechanics. For, importantly, "nowhere does quantum mechanics leave room for a supplementation of its propositions." The only area where indeterminacy applies is the cut. For Heisenberg, the indeterminacy principle poses the question "whether scientists will have to abandon forever the thought of an objective time scale shared by all observers, objective occurrences in space and time independent of any observation, or whether the latest development should be regarded as no more than a passing crisis." He believes that we will have to abandon such hopes for good. Coherence now comes at a price, and the price is perspective. Coherence is relative to a scheme. In principle, this is precisely the message of the Third Critique, now forcefully corroborated by experimen tal and theoretical physics. Another sobering entailment of Heisenberg's account concerns the signified. Neither on the human-scale side of</page><page sequence="17">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 249 classical description nor on the side of mathematical functions can we discover any Lacanian glissement. In each domain the signifier-signified relation, Heisenberg assures us, is secured. The glissement belongs strictly to the incommensurability of two different kinds of description. At the same time, there is no transcendental signified either. "What then is the world like?" turns out to be the wrong question. It depends from where and how we look. We do need coherence and we do need signifieds, but they are epistemic and phenomenal rather than ontic and noumenal. Heuristic Coherence and the Persistence of the Signified It seems that interpretation is unable to embrace wholeheartedly the radical consequences of skepticism towards the signified (concept) and coherence. Indeed, when Lyotard suggests that "reality is consensus," his and other antitotalizing arguments are already contested from within.48 Not surprisingly, Lyotard's antitotality call runs into difficulties on a number of fundamental issues: 1.) His political transformation of the Kantian sublime from what is zweckwidrig, and so violently incommensurable with our imagination, into the unpresentable in presentation?that which artists and philosophers must present in the face of its unpresentability?is a major theoretical project in its own right. 2.) Lyotard's theorization of injustice in the form of the "diff?rend" hides the powerful and coherent narrative of social justice. 3.) His non-anthropomorphic agonistic theory of discourse, though requiring a certain amount of reconstructive labor on the part of the reader, fails to shake off the shackles of coherence. One could say that where Lyotard tried to get rid of coherence but fortunately failed, Baudrillard has tried and unfortunately succeeded, if only at the price of self-contradiction. And yet, as is often the case with radical theorizing, at another level, indirectly, in a non-Hegelian Aufhebung, and quite against both the author's and readers' expecta tions, a project emerges through the stream of conceptual contradic tions. If we wish to be politically effective, to the degree that theorizing can achieve this at all, Baudrillard's is not the way to go. Homi Bhabha, for example, has pointed criticism in more promising directions. Not surprisingly, he needs signifieds to make his signifiers stick, and his project could not be argued without the principle of coherence. Bhabha's idea of "third space" in his paper "The Commitment to Theory" helps to make the point. He rejects the idea that theory remains the language of Eurocentrism and neocolonialism, that theory is no more than "another power ploy of the culturally privileged Western</page><page sequence="18">250 NEW LITERARY HISTORY elite" perpetuating its own power-knowledge position.49 Instead he argues for a space for "translation" that, here and elsewhere, he calls "hybridity" (117). Theory for Bhabha is negotiation rather than nega tion, to foreground political temporality. Hybridity does away with such tired binaries as theory versus political practice. Translation as negotia tion also disallows the gestures of theoretical closure as it prohibits the universalization of the colonial Other into a "docile body of difference" (124). While domination then is Bhabha's main indictment of critical theory, he does not wish to give up on interpretation as a critical project. Emmanuel Levinas stands closer to Kant's Critique of Judgment than to the hermeneutic tradition when he frees holistic interpretation from the tyranny of totality.50 The kind of "communicative rationality" beyond J?rgen Habermas proposed by Calvin Schr?g chooses the metaphor of "transversal" or diagonal logic to offer an interpretive holism that avoids on the one hand the "synchronie verticality of totalitarian hegemony" and, on the other, the "diachronic horizonality of anarchic multiplicity." Without stipulating some form of coherence, such "transversal logic" would be unrecognizable.51 There remains an interpretive project in the most radical hermeneutics,52 and even the second attempt by Paul Feyerabend to kiss reason goodbye remains a farewell to a certain kind of reason by reason. As Thomas Docherty has argued, cogently in my view, postmodern forms of characterization in appearing to support the notion of incoherence at the narrative surface offer the political project of a new ethics. Underneath the dissolution of postmodern characterization the "fundamental ontology" of character is "replaced by a first philoso phy of ethical demand." For Docherty, the aim of postmodern character presentation is no less than "to replace the philosophy of Identity with that of Alterity."54 Nor could the connection drawn by Michel Foucault between power and knowledge become as persuasive as it has without it being embedded in the coherence of a larger archaeology.55 Deconstruction is often invoked as a case that illustrates the force of non-totalizing theorizing. Neither the history of deconstruction, from Husserl's strategy of critical dismantling, to Heidegger's Destruktion and Derrida's method of "inhabiting and castrating" a text, nor Derrida's own practice actually demonstrates non-totalization. I have argued elsewhere the architectural elegance of his (quasi-) transcendental procedure in "Differance," a masterpiece in philosophical cohesion, culminating in the ambitious replacement of Heidegger's pyramid of the positivities of beings generalized into Being by an assemblage of empty differential relations collectively characterized by the new notion of differance, which is both "older than Being" and "unnameable," a "play that brings about the nominal effects."56 Contrary to Heidegger's Being, "there is no essence of differance" and so it can claim to have pushed the</page><page sequence="19">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 251 project of "overcoming metaphysics" as far as is possible, a project which remains committed nevertheless to the principle of methodological coherence. The same can be said about "The Retrait of Metaphor," in which Derrida presents a major statement on how the general with drawal of Being can be demonstrated by a meticulous tracing of consequences arising from the modest starting point of what is entailed in the Greek meaning of metaphor as a figure of speech that "carries" us "away."57 Here too, there remains, on the other side of metaphysical nostalgia, his "shocking" concession of some "Heideggerian hope."58 What can be said about interpretive coherence holds also for the signified. The popular phrase "there are only signifiers" is at best an unfortunate shorthand; at worst it is literally thoughtless. Shorthand in the sense that what we should be saying is that in any signifying chain every signified turns into yet another signifier, an observation that Husserl made with respect to noematic realizations functioning at the same time as noetic moments in the dynamics of intentionality. Thought less also in the literal sense that without signifieds the linguistic sign would shrink to its sound image without concept; it would be both blind and empty. As Niall Lucy reminds us, Derrida has never quite given up on the signified for the simple reason that "we cannot think the concept of the signifier in the absence o? a concept of the signified."59 It is not the signifier and syntax by themselves that inspire Heidegger's and Derrida's quasi-etymological wanderings, but at each moment the signifieds that can be harvested. True, our ears and eyes guide us along the trajectory of similarity and difference of sound and graphic image. \et, if the chains of signifiers did not yield at each turn the rich conceptuality of a new imaginable world, those signifiers in their specific order would be no more to us than the rhymes of a song in a foreign tongue. Deleuze and Guattari are right in not letting go of the signified. Stubbornly they assert the contrary; they insist on the concept, regarding the creation of new concepts, rather than merely new signifiers, as the core task of philosophy. Nor is their mission weakened by the fact that their creativity works not at the level of the signifier?typographical experimentation or mere rephrasing?but at the level of the signified. I end my defense of the signified with a puzzling quotation from Lacan 's Ecrits. The shifter "I," Lacan observes, "designates the subject of the enunciation, but it does not signify it."m This throws a big spanner in the kind of theory of language his writings suggest. It seems now that the signifier, though unable to signify without a signified, nevertheless is doing some semantic work, namely designation. Yet designation is pre cisely a conceptual process in any theory or philosophy of language. Designation is a term that indicates the directionality of the linguistic sign which comes into effect in the process of meaning-making, that is, in the</page><page sequence="20">252 NEW LITERARY HISTORY event of cashing the signifier in for a signified. Members of a speech community have been trained to do so habitually, but even in problem atic pragmatic events, such as occur typically in reading poetry, we can only speak of designation once we have conceptualized the signifier. Does designation belong to the signifier in Lacan's picture of the linguistic sign? And does only "full" signification require the signified? Does designation stay within the constraints of the differential system? Does signification likewise occur within this domain? Or does one of the two point outside to perceptual and somatic realizations? Does designa tion hover, as it were, on Saussure 's bar between signifier and signified? Or within Heisenberg's cut? But then, "the line in the Saussurean algorithm is resistant to signification. In language, the line symbolizes the mind's detour in search of meaning."61 Lacan's use of designation suggests that we are already underway towards some meaning before we get to the bar. Perhaps Lacan 's disturbing remark is one of the sources of a current tendency to speak of signifiers as if they were able to mean by themselves. If signifiers were indeed to be regarded as having some meaning function on their own, such as designation, the entire structur alist edifice would come crumbling down, including its postmodern remnants. What seems to be needed is at least the redefinition of Lacan's point de capiton as a quasi-perceptual signified by means of which we can insert into the emptiness of the signifier a slice of the imagined world. Such a reorientation appears to be made possible by recent approaches to language from the perspective of the body. Corporeal Pragmatics A corporeal pragmatic semantics promises to respect at least the foundational conditions of heuristic cohesion and the functional role of the signified. Keeping this promise obliges us to theorize how a culture guides, rather than rules, the instantiation of linguistic meanings in the process of linking perceptual readings (as well as their virtual fantasy extensions) with linguistic signifiers to generate signifieds. The obliga tion of such a semantics to take culture into account may be illustrated by juxtaposing two distinct approaches to interpretation and language that each take a corporeal perspective. One, based on neuroscience, is exemplified by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought (1999); the other, a speculative-critical approach embedded in a broad philosophical tradition, could be identified as a pragmatic corporeal semantics?2 The human mind, Lakoff and Johnson claim, operates essentially by way of the neurological pathways established biologically for our</page><page sequence="21">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 253 sensorimotor functioning. No matter how imaginative our reasoning, they maintain, its foundations are buried well out of reach of our mental control in the synaptic network of our animal nature. Mental processes function largely in terms of the "cognitive unconscious," responsible for "all unconscious mental operations concerned with conceptual systems, meaning, inference, and language."63 According to Lakoff and Johnson human categorization is "neural categorization" determined largely by "how we are embodied." On this basis Lakoff and Johnson postulate the "embodied concept," a neural phenomenon which is "actually part of or relies on "the sensorimotor system of our brains." "Much of concep tual inference is, therefore, sensorimotor inference" (20); "in an em bodied mind, it is conceivable that the same neural system engaged in ^rception (or in bodily movement) plays a central role in conception" (38). The "cognitive mechanism for such conceptualizations is concep tual metaphor, which allows us to use the physical logic of grasping to reason about understanding"(45). This prehensile principle of body-mind coherence is promising, as far as it goes. Yet the way taken by Lakoff and Johnson from neural synapses to what a natural language like Russian, Chinese, or English looks like seems much too straightforward to be plausible. What is missing is an argument devoted to the role of society, culture, the speech community, and other nonbiological perspectives without which the question of interpretation of complex phenomena cannot even be posed. The subsumption of the social under the notion of the cognitive unconscious in Philosophy in the Flesh is, I think, a mistake. Individual variation in meaning making, resistance to learning things in a certain way, the highly conscious way of language acquisition process in bilingual and multilingual situations, the question of social sanction, and the commu nal "verification" processes in language application, to name only a few complications, all stand in the way of the direct route from neural pathway to higher-level conceptual metaphor. Philosophy in the Flesh offers no detailed argument to persuade us that the patterning that occurs at the neural level of sensorimotor response to our environment is the same as the patterning of conceptual meta phor. What precisely are the different steps involved in the way the brain transforms, for instance, a visual neural analog of human aggression into a linguistic form such as "fighting" and further into the abstraction of a phrase such as a "fighting chance"? When tilting against the idea that human transcendent reason and the concepts it elaborates are structurally disembodied, Lakoff and Johnson occupy shaky ground. They remain vulnerable to critique on account of several deficiencies, among them their disregard of the manifest fact that a priori reasoning works, their lack of a theory of language, and most glaringly their</page><page sequence="22">254 NEW LITERARY HISTORY inability to make room for the social. This flaw results from precisely the kind of strictly empirical science orientation of which the book is so proud. In spite of the many useful insights Lakoff and Johnson offer, the empirical evidence of neural science proves too blunt an instrument to explain what happens when we communicate linguistically, which is to say, in a given sociocultural situation. As it stands, therefore, Philosophy in the Flesh offers too ontic a notion of coherence. Viewed as a heuristic, it works with too narrow an interpretive frame. By contrast, a speculative corporeal pragmatics can accept the embodied mind hypothesis as a primitivum, while reaching well beyond neurological limits. At the risk of appearing dogmatic in the restricted space of an article, I conclude this section with a condensed summary of the ground rules by which such a corporeal pragmatics might work. Language as a set of signifiers remains an empty syntactic matrix, unless it is semantically activated by nonverbal signification. This sug gests that nonverbal signification constitutes something like a "deep structure" of language, the linguistic signs of which are parasitic on nonverbal semiosis. In the process of meaning making, our tactile, olfactory, visual, and other perceptual readings of the world, as well their fantasy variants, provide language with non-arbitrary signifieds. Even the most abstract notions display traces of concrete situations, and those concrete situations are in turn always social situations. When meaning events occur, they do so under the guidance of semiotic communities that monitor the way we link language and perceptual "world" to constitute linguistic perspectives. Reviving a Leibnizian notion, we could term this dynamic linkage a "sufficient semiosis."64 The main metaphysi cal presuppositions of such a semantics reveal themselves as a textual realism in which the world is not physicalistically given but mediated by nonverbal signs, economized by linguistic signifiers. Nonverbal signs, then, are the basis for both world and linguistic meaning. This view of the matter also entails that perceptually activated linguistic signs reflect the deep constraints imposed on us by the universe as filtered by culture, such that suffident semiosis replaces truth conditions.65 In this scenario, signifieds enjoy various degrees of stability, depending on the discursive regime in which they occur, while heuristic coherence is a necessary consequence of the perceptual basis of language and human-scale understanding as holistic projection. Conclusion If the collective achievements of critical theories over the last century can be said to amount to a Fourth Critique, this is defensible only if we</page><page sequence="23">THE FOURTH CRITIQUE 255 accept both heuristic coherence and the inevitability of signifieds. To do so is not so much to yearn for "the lost fatherland of thought"66 as it is to express a serious doubt whether it is at all possible to interpret without frames, or to abandon in the linguistic sign the conceptual linkage with the perceptual "outside" (or "inside") of language. Nor can this be construed as a return beyond the il ny a pas de hors-texte, since the perceptual readings of our world too constitute a massive, even if iconic text.67 Coherence phobia and the elimination of the signified are the result of our forgetting the somatic ground of language, an amnesia that prevents us from addressing the relationship language has with our culturally overdetermined perceptual and emotional semiotic systems. In this sense, in natural language use, we are dealing with neither formal, nor positivist, nor merely neurobiological signifiers, but with existential signifiers and their synaesthetic signifieds. The fact that we live in a body cannot be eliminated by syntactic substitutional chains. We can play chess, even with English, but this particular language game is fundamentally different from using a natural language, for it lacks the epistemic foundation of human cognition: our all-pervasive corporeal ity. It is our corporeality, in the broadest possible sense, which sets the inner and outer horizons of interpretation as speculative-critical activity and acts as the deep ground for both heuristic coherence and the cognitive fact of the signified.68 No wonder we have to strain to avoid searching for meaning and looking for how things fall into place in large configurations. This is not a bad metaphysical habit, it is the way of physical organisms?9 In different ways, Spinoza, Peirce, Uexkuell, V?rela, and others have directed our attention to this alternative way of looking at human consciousness, cognition, and language. What emerges, gradually but forcefully, is that coherence thinking is a necessary effect of human physiognomy and the evolution of organisms in a process of autopoietic projection. The iconic basis of language is what makes Richard Rorty's remark ring right that "it is pictures rather than propositions, metaphors rather than statements, which determine most of our philosophical convictions."70 Instead of subjecting Heidegger's ontological conviction that "Being speaks through language; everywhere and always" to the critique of differance, as does Derrida, we could say more modestly "the way we touch the world speaks through every language; everywhere and always."71 Neither metaphysics, nor its "overcoming," but our corporeal ity remains the hidden ground of interpretation.

Meltzer [1931] (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1962), 37-38; in a footnote G?del adds, "more precisely, there are undecidable propositions in which, besides the logical constants - (not), v (or), (x) (for all) and = (identical with), there are no other concepts beyond + (addition) and . (multiplication), both referred to natural numbers, and where the prefixes (x) can also refer only to natural numbers" (38). 46 See Jacques Derrida, "The First Session," Acts of Literature. It is puzzling why Derrida restricts his uptake of G?del to the syntax of natural languages and syntactic form. Undecidability, he writes, is not the result of "some enigmatic equivocality, some inexhaustible ambivalence of a word in a 'natural' language . . . What counts here is not the lexical richness, the semantic infiniteness of a word or concept, its depth or breadth, the sedimentation that has produced inside it two contradictory layers of signification (continuity and discontinuity, inside and outside, identity and difference, etc.). What counts here is the formal or syntactical praxis that composes and decomposes it" (173). This does of course not rule out instability on the side of the signified. 47 Werner Heisenberg, "Wandlungen der Grundlagen der exakten Natur-wissenschaft in juengster Zeit" [1934], in Von der Naturforschung zur Naturwissenschaft: Vortr?ge, gehalten auf Versammlungen der Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Arzte (1822-1958), ed.
