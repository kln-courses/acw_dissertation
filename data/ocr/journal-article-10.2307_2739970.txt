<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Predynastic Development in the Nile Valley' by A. J. Arkell and PeterJ. Ucko INTRODUCTION UNTIL VERY recently most textbooks dealing with the birth of neolithic civilization referred to the Tigris/ Euphrates and Nile valley as the two primary centres of the "neolithic revolution." During the last few years excavations in the Near East, outside Egypt, have produced evidence of cultures dating back to c. 8,000 B.C., and these exciting new finds have neces- sitated complete revision of the problem of the birth of civilization in the Near East. The Hassuna culture, not so long ago considered very near to the beginning of settled life, is late in comparison to the finds at such sites as Jericho, Hacilar, and Chatal Hiiyiik. One effect of these recent excavations has been to push back our knowledge of the earliest neolithic cultures of the Near East to a date about 3,000 years earlier than any predynastic culture dated by C-14 in Egypt. Cultures outside the Near East also, such as neolithic Thessaly, Crete, and the Balkans, are now dated by C-14 back to c. 6,000 B.C. On the basis of C-14 dates, therefore, the development of the prehistoric Nile Valley appears almost irrelevant from the point of view of the first domestication of animals, the first cultivation of cereals, the first practice of agriculture, and the first making of pottery. This article is an attempt to review our present knowledge of Nile Valley prehistodry and to determine whether this region should be considered to lie outside the mainstream of Near Eastern neolithic-chalcolithic development. At the very outset it must be made clear that the absence of modern scientific excavations of predynastic sites, and therefore the almost exclusive reliance on material excavated roughly sixty years ago, accounts for much of our ignorance of early develop- ment in the Nile Valley, with the result that much of what follows is both hypothetical and oversimplified. As is well known, Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie's system of Sequence Dating for the predynastic period of Egypt was primarily based on 900 graves with not less than five different types of pottery in them. Although Petrie allowed thirty Sequence Dates for earlier cul- tures, it has not been found possible to apply the Sequence Date system to earlier cultures which are now known. It is also unfortunately true that little correlation between these early cultures within either Lower or Upper Egypt, or between Lower and Upper Egypt, has proved possible (Fig. 1). NEOLITHIC The Fayum Neolithic is probably the oldest known neolithic culture so far found in Egypt. It is known from Gertrude Caton-Thompson's excavation of several sites on the north and northeast banks of a Lake Moeris, then more extended than at the present day. The excavator concluded that the Neolithic people came to the Fayum not long after the lake had been reflooded by the Nile, after becoming dried up in Upper Palaeolithic times. They settled where huts or shelters could be placed in the lee of sandstone buttes or mounds, near strips of cultivable soil on -the edge of the lake and near indentations of the shoreline, where fishing was good. They cultivated emmer wheat and barley, some of which gave evidence of undergoing rapid mutation as if it were newly introduced into the ANTHONY JOHN ARKELL, Reader in Egyptian Archaeology in the University of London and Curator of the Flinders Petrie Col- lection, was born in 1898. He was in the Sudan Political Service from 1920 to 1938. After having obtained a B. Litt. at Oxford University, he returned to the Sudan as Commissioner for Archaeology and Anthropology until 1948 when he joined the staff of University College, London. He received the D. Litt. in 1955. His early publications dealt with his excavations of prehistoric Sudanese sites at Khartoum and Shaheinab. He has subsequently worked on all aspects of Predynastic Egyptian culture. PETER JOHN UCKO, Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Anthropology, University College, London, was born in 1938. He studied anthropology for his B. A. Hons. degree, taking Egyptology and prehistoric Near Eastern Archaeology as special subjects. His Ph.D. thesis was on prehistoric human figurines from predynastic Egypt, prehistoric Mesopotamia and Anatolia, prehistoric- Greece and neolithic Crete. His first publications include analysis and discussiora of the neolithic figurines from Crete, including those from the recent excavations at Knossos where the author was site-supervisor, and- a discussion of the problem of forgeries among predynastic Egyptian figurines. He is now taking a special inter6st in primitive technology.

Two groups of underground granaries were found, 165 in all. The animal remains were not fully studied, and have disappeared at the British Museum (Natural History), South Kensington. They included "csheep or goat," ox and pig, as well as hippopotamus, elephant, antelope, gazelle, crocodile and fish; but the excavator states that none of them "need necessarily be domesticated." That hunting of game near the lake played a large part in their life is to be inferred from the numerous concave-base stone arrowheads (Fig. 2), a type unknown in the Upper Nile Valley, but with a wide distribution in what is now the Sahara. Amazon-stone for beads may have come from the northern outliers of Tibesti, while the distinctive Fayum gouge-adze (Fig. 3) seems to be derived from the Upper Palaeolithic Lupemban culture of the Congo. Both these features therefore, like the distribution of the concave-base arrowhead, suggest connections with the western steppes. Other traits of the Fayum Neolithic include cooking hearths, the absence of burial within the settlement, stone celts that were partly ground after flaking, and the burnishing of pottery. Flax was cultivated, thread spun on the spindle, and a coarse linen woven by the Fayum Neolithic people. There is no evidence of their having worked ivory, but small harpoons and bevelled points were made of bone. No shell fish-hooks were found, though they may have existed. (They break up very easily, and no Badarian examples were found at first). Since baskets were made, fish were possibly trapped, and may have been caught in nets too. Baskets and straw-matting used for lining granaries reached a high standard. Sickle- flints (Fig. 4) were mounted in a straight wooden handle. -Sea shells for ornaments were obtained from both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The only stone mace-head has a flat top. The pottery (Fig. 5) is hand-made from coarse clay with much chaff used as a filler. The pots are often asymmetrical, and the rims are straight without moulding. Bases show considerable variety, being rounded, flattened, knobbed or ring-based. Pots include small bowls and cups, cooking bowls and pots, deep bowls with a slight keel, pedestalled cups, cups with knobbed feet and sub-rectangular dishes with peaked rims, the latter possibly copying the shell of the large land tortoise. Some pots have red slip and are well burnished. No incised, combed or painted pottery occurs. The excavator, Caton-Thompson, separated as a later stage of the Fayum Neolithic, and mainly because of an association with a lower stage of the lake, a group which she labelled Fayum Neolithic B. This group, lacking pottery, had a considerable proportion 146 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT * 'I1 FIG. 2 FIG. 3 Fayum Neolithic flint arrowhead Fayum Neolithic gouge-adze (1/1 natural size) (5/9 natural size) FIG. 4 Fayum Neolithic sickle flints (5/8 natural size) FIG. 5. Fayum Neolithic pottery (1/18 natural size) of microlithic stone tools virtually absent in the main stage (Group A), and other tools "characterized more by an absence of specifically A Group types, and by degeneration in the general level of manufacture of the surviving forms" (1934:57). Typical Fayum B microliths such as tiny tanged arrowheads and trihedral rods occur in the Bedouin Microlithic of Kharga Oasis (Caton-Thompson 1952) and in the Neolithic of the Sahara further west. Caton-Thompson wrote (1952:33) that she would "rank the Kharga Micro- lithic groups as Neolithic and have done with it," but on page 36 she concludes that "in Kharga certain Microlithic groups... may be absolutely older than any known Egyptian Neolithic group... though it seems likely that Bedouin Microlithic tribes roamed round Kharga... in Predynastic times... and long after." It is possible, therefore, that the Fayum Neo- lithic B was associated with a rising (not a falling) lake, and that therefore it may be earlier than Fayum Neolithic A. Were this so, Caton-Thompson's degen- erate survivals from the Neolit-hic A would be simple precursors of the Neolithic A forms. Rare examples of the "gouge" from Fayum Neolithic B could easily be intrusive from a higher A Group assemblage. The two C-14 dates for Fayum Neolithic A are 4,440 B.C. ? 180, and 4,145 B.C. ? 250, but Caton-Thompson still holds the opinion she expressed in 1934 that a date prior to 5,000 B.C. is more likely. This leads directly to the great problem of C-14 dates from predynastic Egypt. Firstly the probability that, owing to an error in the estimation of the half-life of C-14, dates will have to be pushed back progressively (e.g., a date of c. 4,400 will be raised to c. 4,950 B.C.) must be noted (Kohler and Ralph 1961). Secondly, and perhaps more relevant here, is the question of the re- liability of isolated C-14 dates. The greater the number of C-14 dates for a culture, the greater the reliability. Two typical dates isolated from the recent series of C-14 dates for Jarmo, for example, show the site to date from c. 6,750 B.C. or c. 4,750 B.C., and each of these dates has a cluster of other C-14 dates around them (Matson in Braidwood and Howe 1960:69). It is clear, therefore, that isolated C-14 dates must still be viewed with the utmost caution, although the general picture revealed by series of C-14 determinations has revealed a coherent pattern. There is virtually no series of C-14 dates for any predynastic site, so that it becomes difficult to assess which cultures may have been contemporary with Fayum Neolithic, which earlier, and which later in date. It must have been from Asia that the wheat, barley, and flax of the Fayum Neolithic came-from some centre in Asia where the ancestors of these cereals once grew wild (in the case of barley, just possibly from Abyssinia). It is possible that the Delta itself was un- inhabitable at this period (Baumgartel 1955:3), so that this early influence from Asia may have come along the fringes of the Delta. A culture possibly related to the Fayum Neolithic is that of the vast site of Merimde on the western edge of the Delta. C-14 dates for Merimde vary from c. 4,172 B.C. tO c. 1,672 B.C. with a certain clustering round c. 3,600 B.C. It seems likely that the excavator, Junker, confused a very early culture at Merimde witb later ones (Baumgartel 1955), so that very little can be said with certainty about this Lower Egyptian culture which cultivated barley, emmer wheat, and club wheat-the latter not known till much later anywhere in the Near East except at certain Lower Egyptian sites (Helbaek 1955). It seems that shelters and wooden houses were followed by oval houses of mud, with water-collecting pots sunk in the beaten earth floors; these oval houses were arranged along paths to form a well organised village including mud-lined pit gran- aries. This is the only knowledge that we have of settlement in Lower Egypt at this early period, unless el Omari be roughly contemporary with late Merimde. Thle amazon-stone of the Fayum Neolithic most probably came from Eghei Zumma, a northern outlier of Tibesti; and draws attention to the cultures discovered around Khartoum, because the Khartoum Neolithic, with one isolated C-14 date of c. 3,300 B.C., al so h ad beads manufactured fr^om amazon-ston e.

This Khartoum Neolithic culture is derived from the Khartoum Mesolithic whose type site, Early Khar- toum (Arkell 1947, 1949), the only one so .far ex- cavated, lies on the highest point in Khartoum, on what was once the left bank of the Blue Nile. Many other sites' of this culture have been found in the Nile Valley around Khartoum, and also as far east as Kassala and as far west as Ennedi and Wanyanga. The inhabitants were heavily built people who lived by hunting and fishing. They left traces of wattle and daub windscreens, and buried their dead carefully in the site, which may have been only a dry season camp. The fauna, which includes an extinct reed rat, whose nearest relation comes from West Africa, indicates a rainfall 3-4 times greater than the present, with swamps (Nile Lechwe and water mongoose) in the vicinity. Such a conclusion is supported by Fairbridge's recent (1962) summary of climatic evidence in Egypt between c. 9,000-5,000 B.C. which suggests a considerable'in- cidence of rainfall-post-summer monsoonal rain- resulting in a rich and varied fauna. Excavation at Shaheinab, the type site of the Khartoum Neolithic, established that high Nile in. neolithic times was five metres higher than it is today, while a Late Khartoum Mesolithic site (with Dotted Wavy Line pottery, see below) in the vicinity indicated that in late Meso- lithic times, high Nile was over ten metres higher than it is today (Arkell 1953a:8). Erosion during the last millennium or so has removed up to two metres from the surface of the site of Early Khartoum, but there still remains at least a metre of deposit in places (see Arkell 1947, diagram on page 173). It seems very likely that the Mesolithic occupation of Early Khar- toum lasted a very long time. It has been suggested that the Khartoum Mesolithic dates back to the Makalian wet period, c. 7,000 B.C. (Pittioni 1950). At Early Khartoum the best stone tools were micro- lithic, mostly backed crescents or lunates, made from waterworn quartz pebbles obtained locally, no doubt used for arming arrows; but they also included borers and small backed "blades." There were also larger crescents made from rhyolite from the Sixth Cataract. Larger 'stone tools which were less carefully made, include flakes struck from prepared cores and rough scrapers. Hammerstones of gneiss and rhyolite, as well as many rubbers and grinders, were probably all used. for grinding red-ochre, of which there were traces. Other rubbers and also many sandstone half-rings were found, which may have been used for wood-working. Some 270 fragments of bone harpoons (Fig. 6), near- ly all barbed on. one side only (3 only barbed on both sides), were mostly of a size to suggest their use as harpoons or spear shafts, though a few were so small that 'they must have been used on arrows. Typical pots were large bowls of well-fired brown ware containing some angular quartz grains and with simple rims slightly thinner than the rest of the pot. Pots were not burnished but smooth on the inside, and decorated on the outside, with particular care near the rim, with impressions of a catfish spine used as a comb, .... - -...n. FIG. 6. Khartoum Mesolithic bone harpoon (2/5 natural size) FIG. 7. Khartoum Mesolithic pottery (2/5 natural size) in patterns featuring wavy lines (Fig. 7); the apparent intention of this decoration was to make the pots look like baskets. The pots were made by coiling; no com- plete examples were found, only sherds in very large numbers. At a late stage, the simple wavy line combing was superseded by a more complicated decoration in which dots were impressed along the wavy lines, producing "Dotted Wavy Line Ware." On some sites this is found without the ordinary Wavy Line ware. This unbur- nished Dotted Wavy Line ware is clearly related to pottery found in rock shelters in Ennedi (Bailloud 1958) which also included sherds of Burnished Dotted Wavy Line (Fig. 8), a few of which were first recog- nized at Shaheinab. Late Khartoum Mesolithic pottery has also been found on several eroded sites round a lake in the Wanyanga area in Borkou (Arkell 1962). Wavy Line ware has also been found at Meniet in Mouydir, Northwest Hoggar, for which site there is an isolated C-14 date of 3,430 B.C. Late Khartoum Mesolithic pottery has, therefore, an extremely wide distribution of well over 1,000 miles. This Dotted Wavy Line Ware provides an important link with the next culture, the Khartoum Neolithic, in which rare sherds occur with a very similar pattern, but with the difference that they are all burnished (Arkell 1953a:pl. 29.1). FIG. 8. Early Khartoum Neolithic pottery (2/5 natural size) The Khartoum Neolithic appears to be confined to the Nile Valley within 60 miles of Khartoum, a much more restricted range than that of the Khartoum Meso-' lithic, although sherds of Burnished Dotted Wavy Line ware have been found in Ennedi by Bailloud and in the Wanyanga area of Borkou (Arkell 1959a:20. and pl. 12). The type site, Shaheinab, some 30 m. north of Khartoum, lies on an oldbank of the Nile, then over 5 m. higher at flood time than it is today, and consists of occupation debris from an apparently permanent settlement, which occurs in the first 1-2 feet of a gravel ridge, stretching for some 100 yards. Excavation at another site, El Qoz, on the southern edge of Khar- toum near an earlier junction of the Blue and White Niles, confirmed the superposition of the Khartoum Neolithic on the Khartoum Mesolithic. Faunal evidence 148 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY -</page><page sequence="5">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT from Shaheinab suggests an annual rainfall of about 500 mm. in the Khartoum Neolithic. This would be intermediate between that of the Khartoum Mesolithic and the present day (164 mm). The surrounding country was then steppe and forest, instead of the swamps and grassy plains of Mesolithic times. The inhabitants were still predominantly hunters and fishers. Of the animal remains, 98 % were those of wild animals, the remain- der being goat and possibly sheep. Numerous hearths were an innovation, and their main feature was an area paved with small lumps of sandstone, probably made red-hot by fire for the grilling of meat. The dead were no longer buried in the settlement, and fruitless search for a cemetery makes it likely that corpses were disposed of otherwise than by burial. Of the stone implements, the crescents (even more numerous than in the Khartoum Mesolithic) are slight- ly smaller and better made; scrapers, still rare, are better finished, and borers are more numerous and show greater variety. Sandstone ochre grizfders are rather more standardized, while sandstone rubbers are more developed, and regular tapering forms (reamers) occur. A small number of complete sandstone rings occur, probably maceheads, as opposed to the half stone rings of the Khartoum Mesolithic; also rare flat- topped maceheads made from ochre-grinders of hard black and white stones (granite, diorite, gneiss) 'from the Sixth Cataract area (Arkell 1953a:pl. 23, 5-7), and a few fragments of true disc maceheads of similar stones occur. A new type of stone tool was the bifacial celt (Fig. 9) (usually employed as an adze) accom- panied by the new technique of partial grinding or polishing of the cutting edge of these celts, a technique no doubt derived from ochre-grinding. A peculiar and important form of the partly polished celt was the hollow-cut adze or "'gouge," the back of which was deliberately polished. This tool, which must have been used for hollowing wood, has a known distribution in the Neolithic, from Tenere (Joubert and Vaufrey 1941-6:fig. 2.16) north of Lake Chad through Bilma (Noel 1917:359) and' Djado as far north as Tummo, some 250 miles west of Eghei. Another characteristic tool of the Khartoum Neo- FIG. 9. Khartoum Neolithic bifacial celt (1/2 natural size) lithic is a copy of the stone celt in bone (Arkell 1953a: pl. 26), a tool perhaps used for hacking meat from large game animals. The bone harpoon (Fig. 10) typical of this culture is perforated behind the last barb as an improvement on the grooved butt of the Khar- toum Mesolithic for the attachment of the line; there seem to be no barbed bone arrowheads. Another innovation is the notched and barbless fish- hook (Fig. 11) cut out of the shells of Nile bivalves (Arkell 1953a:pl. 27, 9-10). Pieces of cut shell from the manufacture of these fish-hooks were used for producing the impressed vee-and-dot patterns, the characteristic decoration of the larger pottery bowls (none of which has been found complete).

Khartoum Neolithic Khartoum Neolithic potiery shell fish-hook (1/2 natural size) (1/1 natural size) shown in Arkell 1953a:pls. 29-35. Unlike the pottery of the Khartoum Mesolithic, it is usually burnished, and the rims are often thickened and decorated (Arkell' 1953a:pl. 36-37). Some sherds are burnished after incised decoration, and the process was on the point of developing the rippling characteristic of Badarian (see below). Attempts were also made to decorate small bowls of finer wart (drinking cups?) with black vees along the outside of the rim (pl. 34). The difficulty of producing the vees in black on pots may have led to the production of some brown bowls with black tops, a decorative process which in a more developed form became typical of the later Badarian culture. Several innovations in the sphere of personal deco- ration occur. In addition to ostrich eggshell disc beads which were made in the Khartoum Mesolithic as well, a few disc beads of blue-green amazon-stone were laboriously made locally. River shells were perforated and no doubt worn, while pebbles of zeolite from Blue Nile gravel were worked into pin-like forms and prob- ably worn as lip-plugs. There is no evidence of agriculture. A limited number of Celtis seeds show that wild fruits were still gath- ered for food, and a single carbonized fragment of the pericarp of the oil palm Elaeis guineensis (Arkell 1953a: 105) suggests that it may have been brought from West Africa or the Congo for its food value, although it iS conceivable that ecological conditions at this time were suitable for wild growth locally. Probably' tO- Vol. 6 * No. 2 - April 1965 149</page><page sequence="6">wards the end of the Khartoum Neolithic there is a domesticated dwarf goat (Arkell 1 953a:15-18) which Miss Bate (in Arkell 1953a) pointed out must have come from elsewhere. Charles A. Reed (in Braidwood and Howe 1960) suggests that it could have come from Asia, where domesticated goats are known at Jericho and Jarmo c. 6,500 B.C. Reed does, however, admit that there may have been a true native goat in Africa by the end of the Pleistocene, though there is no evi- dence at present for its existence. These two cultures have been generally assumed to be degenerate survivals of later predynastic Egyptian cultures, while the one available C-14 date has been quoted uncritically (e.g., Childe 1952, Braidwood and Howe 1960, McBurney 1960). As there have been virtually no excavations of early sites in the Sudan, little can be said of the place of the Khartoum cultures in relation to any other Sudanese cultures. However, a camp-fire site, with C-14 date of 7,300 ? 350 B.P. has recently been found at Ukma (Fairbridge 1962) suggesting the existence of very early cultures in this area. No details of the artifacts, if any, at this site have yet been ptiblished. The important point, however, is to note the possibility of connections (via Tibesti?) between the neolithic Fayum and Khartoum cultures, however general may seem the cultural parallels. The importance of the one solitary C-14 date must not be overrated lest the possibility of the Khartoum cultures being earlier than cultures such as the Badarian-Gerzean, rather than their degenerate relation, be ignored. The possibility of contamination with more recent carbon may quite easily explain the one low C-14 date for the, Khartoum Neolithic. The site is only covered with a foot or so of loose gravel, and lies on a track by which cattle go to water dai'ly at the Nile. After watering, they remain at the site, where their dung and urine can as easily contaminate the charcoal,' etc., lying a foot or so below the surface, as can the roots of recent vegetation which still sprouts there in years of good rain. Some of the graves dug into the site after it had been deserted by the Neolithic people probably date from c. 3,300 B.C. Any survey of the prehistory of the Nile Valley must, therefore, bear in mind the possibility that the Fayum (and Merimde?) and Khartoum Neolithic -were roughly contemporary and chronologically early. BADARIAN In the Nile Valley there is no stratigraphic evidence as to the relative age of the Fayum Neolithic and the Badarian; but the archaeological material indicates that the Badarian culture is later than the Fayum Neo- lithic, for while there is no copper in the latter, simple awls and beads (Fig. 13) of copper as well as the earliest "glass" in the Nile Valley, occur in the Badarian. In the Fayum Neolithic there were only a few beads of hard green-blue amazon-stone; in the-Badarian there were so many beads of steatite covered with a film of blue-green glass (glazed steatite) that several hundred from one man's belt wete found in a single grave, and it is clear that these beads were a substitute for the much harder amazon-stone. Both the copper objects and the glazed beads may have been brought to' the Badarians by itinerant foreign pedlars, for there is no FIG. 13. Badarian copper bead (2/1 natural size) evidence of local manufacture. The occurrence of glazed beads and small copper objects found in Badarian graves may therefore be due to trade from across the Red Sea. With the possible exception of Merimde, the first art in the round in the Nile Valley occurs among the Badarians, as small figurines (Brunton and Caton- Thompson 1928:pl. 24; Brunton 1937:pl. 24, figs. 31-2), animals on spoon-handles, and a few amulets. Our knowledge of this culture comes from several cemeteries in the vicinity of Qau in the Badari district of Middle Egypt excavated by Guy Brunton and from an occupation site at Hemamieh in that area excavated by Caton-Thompson (JBrunton and Caton-Thompson 1928; Brunton 1937). Stratification at Hemamieh showed that Badarian preceded Amratian, the earliest Egyptian Predynastic culture known till then. Many people have taken the "Tasian culture" of Upper Egypt to be roughly contemporary with the Lower Egyptian neolithic culture. In fact Brunton (1937:32) wrote "in the Tasian culture we seem to have an earlier phase of the Badarian." Brunton wrong- ly thought stone celts and Black Incised pottery from the Sudan (the latter probably from disturbed Pre- dynastic graves) to be the main features of his "Tasian." In any case he found no separate Tasian village or cemetery, and Baumgartel (1955:20-21) is certainly right to consider Tasian, if it was anything, to have been merely a form of Badarian, and not a separate culture. I The climate was wetter and perhaps colder than at present; skins were worn with the hair inwards, rush or reed matting was plentiful (suggesting swamps), villages were placed on desert spurs, and hippopotamus and crocodile abounded. Evidence as to ;houses is lacking, but sticks and matting found in graves suggest that houses or shelters were made of these materials. The dead were buried in cemeteries to the east of the settlements. Many of the oval graves had been robbed anciently. Part of the cemetery was reserved for males; in other parts, females were buried with males, and in' these latter areas particularly, evidence was found of the cooking and eating of meals in the cemetery. Occasionally, in separate graves of individuals, animals (dog, ox, sheep, and goat?) were carefully buried, wrapped in matting or linen like the humans. Emmer wheat and barley were grown. Husks were found with saw-edged flint knives (Fig. 14) no doubt used for harvesting, and clay bins for granaries. Remains of bread occur in graves, and elaborately decorated ivory spoons may have been used for eating. Castor oil seeds, probably wild, were used, presumably for their oil. Apart from cattle, sheep and goats (?), probably domesticated (though the remains were not carefully studied and have since disappeared), hunting was still important as indicated by flint arrowheads (Fig. 15) with concave base, as in the Fayum Neolithic, and leaf shaped arrowheads. Bird and fish bones were plentiful, but there were no harpoons. The principal Badarian handicrafts were pottery 150 - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT (Fig. 16), stone implements, baskets and mats; also leather garments and blankets, and the weaving of linen, which was more advanced than in the Fayum Neolithic. Badarian pottery is of outstanding quality, never equalled again in Egypt. It included an excep- tionally thin and highly polished ware, sometimes rippled and sometimes smooth. The rippled pottery is particularly characteristic of the Badarian, and was made by burnishing over combing (before firing). Pots are nearly all bowls, sometimes with a keel, and fre- quently black inside and with an irregular black band below the rim outside, having been taken out of the kiln when red-hot and placed upside down in car- bonizing material. In 1928 Caton-Thompson suggested that the Ba- darian use of weather-worn nodules of flint for their stone implements when much better tabular flint was available in bands in the limestone cliffs, indicated that "flint in situ was unfamiliar to them," and "that therefore their original home must be looked for in an area outside the chert-bearing limestone regions" of Egypt (Brunton and Caton-Thompson 1928:75). They lived in the Asiut region only on the east bank of the Nile, and this, combined with their use of Red Sea shells and the ibex (only found today in the Red Sea hills) as a decorative motif on spoon handles and as an amulet, and the absence of harpoons (useful only on the Nile), suggest that they reached Badari along one of the flanks of the Red Sea hills from a locality fur- ther south. The black top and ripple-characteristic of Ba- darian pottery-could well be descended from the black-topped pottery of the Khartoum Neolithic people who sometimes burnished pots already decorated with the older incised decoration giving them an incipient ripple (Arkell 1953a:pl. 3, figs. 10-11). Shell fish- hooks'occur in both the Khartoum Neolithic and the Badarian; those of the latter being typologically later in that some of them are perforated for the attachment of the line-an improvement made easier by the possession 'of copper awls, it being impossible to make a sufficiently small hole in shell with a stone borer. The Badar'ians also had some fishhooks (Fig. 17) and- combs made out of ivory. They also seem to have shared with the Khartoum Neolithic the rare flat- topped macehead (Arkell 1953a:49; Brunton l937:pl. XLII.22; and a fragment from Mostagedda, Area 200, now at University College London: No. UC 6161). In FIG. 14. Badarian flint knife (1/3 natural size) I I FIG. 16.

Badarian ivory fish-hook Badarian slate palette (1/3 natural size) (1/4 natural size) the Khartoum Neolithic and the Fayum Neolithic only sandstone palettes for pigments were used, but the Badarians used slate palettes (Fig. 18), thus introducing a feature that was to last through the Egyptian pre- dynastic down to the First Dynasty. NAQADA I (AMRATIAN) It is with the succeeding Naqada I (Amratian) period that Petrie's Sequence Dates begin. For some consi- derable time there has been doubt as to how far this system of relative dating could be accepted as appli- cable to the generial predynastic development of Egypt (Scharff 1926:73; Scharff 1927:40; Baumgartel 1955: 41), yet it has been largely accepted as correctly show- ing the main stages of predynastic development. Recently, however, the masterly analyses of Kaiser (1956; 1957) have shown that Petrie's reliance on Wavy Handled ware for sequence dating (1920:4) was great- ly misplaced, so that any specific sequence date in- cludes a certain range of error which may be higher or lower, and Sequence Dates between 40-80 are especially dubious. Kaiser's re-analysis of predynastic material has also changed the previously accepted picture of the Am- ratian period. This culture follows the Badarian stratigraphically at the occupation site of Hemamieh (Brunton and Caton-Thompson 1928), and appears to derive from it (contrary to Kaiser's [1956] opinion), having much black-topped red pottery, the shapes of whic have become more elaborate and sophisticated. The ripple and keel characteristic of much Badarian pottery dies out very early in the Amratian, but just enough survives to provide a link. Further evidence of this link is to be found in the slate palettes, the fragmentary flat-topped stone maceheads, the rare decorated ivory hair combs and possibly the painted plant designs which closely resemble the Badarian incised designs. Many of these features show development' in the Amratian. The Amratian culture is known from a number of sites which stretch from around Deir Tasa near Badari in Middle Egypt in the north to a few miles south of the First'Cataract; the most important sites being a very large cemetery and two settlement sites at Naqada, cemeteries at Hu (Diospolis Parva) near Dendera, and -several cemeteries in the Abydos area including Mahasna and Amrah (from which the name Amratian is derived). Two possible C-14 datings for the Amratian period suggest a dlate between 3,800 and 3,600 B.C. (Braid- wood 1957:80C810 and G814), but as these wvere ob- 151</page><page sequence="8">tained from human hair and skin which had been for over 50 years in the soot-laden atmosphere of London, the probability of contamination with modern carbon is high. Despite the stratification at Hemamieh, Kaiser (1956) has pointed out that the Badarian and Naqada I cultures may be partly contemporary elsewhere, for some typical Naqada I wares were found sealed off in Badarian levels at Hemamieh where pure Naqada I was very poorly represented. The explanation for these sealed off Amratian sherds may be that they worked down into the Badarian level before the formation of the breccia. The absence of Naqada I finds in Lower Egypt led Scharff (1927) to suggest the generally accepted thesis that the roots of this culture lay in the south. There is, however, little actual evidence to support this view, for contemporary evidence from the Delta is lacking- unless some parts of Maadi, and other rather non- descript sites date from this time-and this negative evidence may be misleading. Whereas Petrie considered the Naqada I (Amratian) period as a whole characterized by White Cross-lined painted pottery followed by the Gerzean period with Decorated ware, Kaiser has shown (1956) that there are really four major phases from S.D. 30-38, S.D. 38-40/5, S.D. 40/5-63, and S.D. 63-80. In the Amratian (Petrie's S.D. 30-38) most of the stone implements are bifacial. The most characteristic are knives which were ground in order to thin them before being given their final cutting edge. The most striking are the specialized ""fish-tail" knives (Fig. 19) (not lances) whose purpose is uncertain, and the large rhomboid knives which disappear around S.D. 38- 40/5. FIG. 19. Amratian "fish-tail" kmife (1/2 natural size) Stone vases are not numerous and decrease in fre- quency. Those made locally are small cylinders with projecting rims, a copy of ivory vases of the same shape, of which a few occurred in the Badarian. Very rare basalt vases with small splayed foot (Fig. 20) occur, but these were probably brought by itinerant traders from across the Red Sea; the type is known in Mesopotamia. The vast majority of predynastic human figurines known are of Amratian date (80 %) and the small number of figurines from other periods may be sig- nificant or fortuitous. If due tO a chance archaeolo- gical sampling, it must be noted that foreign parallels FIG. 20. FIG. 21. Amratian basalt vase Amratian copper pin (1/5 natural size) (1/2 natural size) which appear to be with Amratian figurines might in fact be with Badarian or Gerzean examples. There are some interesting possible parallels both with figurines from Hacilar and with figurines from Jarmo (Ucko forthcoming publication) but they can not be considered conclusive in themselves. Were these parallels to be corroborated, and assuming them not to be found with Badarian figures, they would suggest a much earlier date for the Amratian than that sug-, gested by C-14. Parallels with Beersheba figures seem much more secure and suggest that contact, even if indirect, took place between these two areas. On present evidence (which must await full publication of the Beersheba material) it might appear that Egyptian influence reached'Beersheba c. 3,500 B.C. In view of this date, it may not be fortuitous that an early Namazga II figurine (c. 3,500 B.c.?) shows several features present in Amratian (and Badarian) figurines. There is no doubt about the similarities between Amratian figurines and numerous examples' from Nubia. At present it a ppears likely that the predynastic Egyptian figurines in luenced Nubian figurines of the Predynastic and A-Group and that there figurine- types continued on into the C-Group (Middle King- dom?). It must, of course, be borne in mind that the scarcity of Nubian figurines earlier than A -group may be misleading (negative evidence). Amratian disc maceheads, usually of diorite or other hard black and white stones, and still at times clearly made from upper grindstones, were plentiful. They could have developed out of the rarer flat-topped maceheads of the Badarian, and though they have unusually small holes, mounted on a withy or leather rope they would have made dangerous weapons. Related forms may have been used as tops, and smaller versions in limestone as spindle whorls. In Kaiser's Period II (S.D. 38-.40/5) pear-shaped maceheads appear. A horizontal loom is shown' on a dish from Badari (UC. 15766). Copper objects are still only small and very rare- copper pins with heads turned over in a loop (Fig. 21), may be the forerunners of copper needles. Amratian combs have long teeth and their backs are ornamented with naturalistic figures in the round of animals, including gi-raffe, antelope and hippopotamus, and with human heads..Worked-ivory hippopotamus tusks occur, occasionally in pairs. Slate palettes, which have geometric shapes in the Badarian, start by being 152 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT FIG. 22. FIG. 23.

The common Black-topped red ware, which developed from the Badarian, is very common at the beginning of the Amratian but decreases in quantity, whereas Polished red ware remains roughly constant throughout. The new burnished red ware painted with patterns in white and called "White Cross-lined" (Fig. 23) by Petrie, is very infrequent at the beginning of the Amratian period, becomes more frequent, and has more or less disappeared again by S.D. 39. In the period when this ware was common men, women, and animals were sometimes represented in scenes of which the motifs show no foreign influence. Black incised pottery (Fig. 24) from the Sudan occurs rarely in graves of S.D. 38-40/5, while quite a number of Rough Ware pottery types appear for the first time. Towards the end of the Amratian a few Decorated vessels with spirals and pointille occur. We have little evidence as to Amratian house forms. Garstang (1903) reports from Mahasna a kind of wind- break, and Caton-Thompson (in Brunton and Caton- Thompson 1928) found clay hut circles at Hemamieh which date from somewhere near the end of the Amratian. On the inside were imprints of reeds or straw, suggesting that the walls were originally of wattle and daub. There were no doors, and the entrance must have been in the superstructure (pre- sumably of wood and straw). There is also part of a model fortress in mud from Diospolis Parva which may be Amratian or Gerzean. -It does not show evi- dence of bricks and may possibly indicate pis6. Settle- ments were more numerous than in Badarian times and tended to be larger and somewhat wealthier. Kaiser (1957) interprets the evidence as showing that the Amratian economy was based on agriculture with cattle-raising, hunting (Fig. 25) and fishing still quite important. From S.D. 30-40/5 there is heightening of cultural level. At its beginning Amratian influence extended from Abydos tO Naqada/Gebelein, later further north to Asyut and south to Aswan, and later still even further south to Dakka. It is noticeable that burial in oval graves grouped in cemeteries continued unchanged from S.D. 30 to S.D. 40/3 and this reflects the continuous, but dy- namic, nature of the Amratian cultural development, although it must be noticed that this period includes the change from Amratian to Gerzean cultures, which is generally considered to reflect infiltration of a new people (Petrie 1920:45) or at least a "fundamental and abrupt change" (Baumgartel 1955:38). NAQADA II (GERZEAN) There is no evidence for any invasion, or that Naqada II (Gerzean) was a complete break with Naqada I (Amratian) because Asiatic people invaded the Nile Valley. Kaiser has recently shown (1956) that the rock pictures in the Eastern Desert (Winkler 1938) do not corroborate such an invasion and that the dating of the various ships shown there does not tie in with an Asia- tic invasion at the beginning of the Gerzean period. In fact the significance of the rock paintings remains largely uncertain. Increasing culture contact, probably due to an increase in the number of itinerant Asiatic merchants visiting Egypt will account for all the new features that characterize the Gerzean, expecially if it is recognized that Naqada I represents a long period. There is no doubt that trade with foreign countries must account for the elements of change, for the be- ginning of the Gerzean/Naqada II (Kaiser's Period II A-B) already shows clear evidence of contact with the Near East. Gerzean sites are more widely spread than Am-- ratian, for the first time extending from Lower Egypt (although only in/ its late development) as far south as the middle of Lower Nubia. None have been found in the Delta itself, and at present there is only one site known between Badari and the northern group of sites near the Fayum. On the basis of this negative evidence Scharff (1927; 1941) developed his generally accepted theory that the Gerzean originated in the Delta with influence from Palestine, and spread southwards from there. There is no evidence to support this theory, and Kaiser (1956) views the Naqada II expansion as centered around Thebes and spreading northwards and southwards from there. Judging from the cemeteries and finds in them, the population was gradually increasing at this time, as was the level of culture. Copper working was presum- ably largely responsible for this. The introduction of the use of sun-dried mud brick for rectangular houses may be deduced from occasional rectangular graves lined with these bricks, and is supported by the model of a house from Amrah. The famous rectangular brick- lined and plastered decorated tomb at Hierakonpolis shows clear connections both with dynastic Egypt and with Asiatic elements (Case and Payne 1962), and may date from the "middle Gerzean" period (Kaiser 1958). It seems likely that there is here evidence for a rich aristocracy. Negative evidence is always unreliable, but it may be significant that no sherds of Gerzean pots decorated with boats (Fig. 26) have come from Hemamieh, the Vol. 6 * No. 2 * April 1965 153</page><page sequence="10">only settlement site (see above) that has been excavated. Decorated Ware continues until S.D. 63 and most of it comes from graves; and although all the birds, animals, and plants depicted on it are African, there are also motifs which may be derived from such religious sym- bols of the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods in Iraq as the "Boat of Life" and the object, consisting of a loop with a tail on top of a pole, known later as the emblem of the fertility goddess Inanna (Contenau 1947:figs. 1084 and 1086; Frankfort 1939:15 and pl. IIIe; Wink- ler 1938:38. pl. XXXIX, Arkell 1959b). Many of the Decorated pots from Egypt have representations of boats. In the earliest examples, there sprouts at the prow a sprig of vegetation, which in later examples looks like some kind of banner. The boats usually have two cabins, above one or both of which is a sign which can sometimes be recognized as that of one of the nomes into which Egypt was divided throughout its history. Zoomorphic vessels in stone and pottery, small stone animals, and amulets also bear witness -to trade with Jemdet Nasr, or people in touch with Jemdet Nasr.

The stone implements show -increasing skill in manufacture, and the zenith of the flint-knapper's art was reached by the magnificent flint knives (Fig. 29) which were ground thin, then flaked by controlled parallel ripple-flaking, and given a saw-cutting edge. The peculiar fish-tail knife continued to be made, al- though the shape changed in a characteristic manner from a U to a V division of the "tail-fin" blades. The slate palettes continue several of the Amratian shapes, but tend to be more stylized (Fig. 30). The contents of Naqada Tomb 1863, a young girl's grave dated by Petrie to S.D. 46, included a Jemdet Nasr cylinder seal (Fig. 31) and a small Black Incised pottery dish from the Sudan. Beads of lapis lazuli, which must have come from Afghanistan via Iraq and the Red Sea, occur in several graves in Egypt, and there are other examples of the Black Incised ware from the Sudan (Petrie 1921: pls. 26- 7; Arkell 195 3b). A few actual pOts imported into Egypt at this time from Iraq (e.g., Brunton and Caton-Thomp?son 1928: pl. 40, FIG. 29. Gerzean flint knife (114 natural size) FIG 30. Gerzean slate palette (118 natural size) FIG. 31. FIG. 32. Gerzean cylinder seal Gerzean copper celt (1/1 natural size) (419 natural size) 59W) and Palestine (e.g., Petrie et al. 1912: pl. 1 1, F. 100; Scharff 1926: pl. 13, h) have survived. Several types of stone vases are common to both Egypt and Mesopotamia (Baumgartel 1955:102-19), and the footed cylinder (see fig. 20), not common in Egypt, must have arisen in Asia. Some of the cylinder seals found in Egypt are imports from Iraq where it had been developed previously. (Kantor 1952). The expansion of this time, no doubt due in great measure to the use of serviceable copper adzes and axes, is reflected by the -extension of the Naqada II culture as far north as .Grzeh (Fig. 32). Petrie gave the name Semainean to the transition period between the Gerzean and the Protodynastic (Archaic) or Protohistoric Period, which starts with the First Dynasty c. 3,000 B.C. or 2,800 B.C., or per- haps with a few kings who appear to have preceded the First Dynasty and are called by Petrie Dynasty O. This period, covered by Petrie's Sequence dates 65-78, probably amounted to a generation or so at the most (Kantor 1944), and is represented by Kaiser's Period III (S.D. 63-80). Kaiser sees the transition from his Period II to III as a peaceful one accompanied by dramatic socio. economic change together with the moving of the capital to Memphis and expansion to the Second Cataract. Decorated and Wavy Handled Wares degenerate, while Late Ware appear in considerable numbers. Recently it has been claimed that the re- cognition of a Semainean Period characterized by Late Ware applies only to certain sites (Case 1962). Gener- ally at Naqada and Diospolis Parva the Late Ware coexist with Wavy Handled and Decorated vessels but at other sites most Late Ware belong to. Dynasty I. It seems, therefore, that. the Late Ware may have arisen first around Naqada and Diospolis Parva and have spread from there. It seems likely, therefore, that the final phase in pre-. dynastic Egyptian developmenlt, with its proto-his-. 154 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT torical and the historical connections with Western Asia (reviewed by Scharff 1941, Frankfort 1951, Emery 1961), and the rise of the historic dynasties was a short internal affair even if accompanied by some strife. CONCLUSION The absence of well-excavated sites is the most im- portant point to emerge from a review of the pre- history of the Nile Valley. It is not presuming too much to suggest that, even if there are pre-pottery sites in Egypt, they would not have been recognised by the early excavators. No one is particularly surpris- ed to find a pre-pottery level at Sesklo despite the previous excavations of the neolithic there, and it is quite conceivable that there are similar levels at sites such as Naqada, Diospolis Parva and Mahasna. The absence of Egyptian sites as old as the prehistoric Anatolian and Mesopotamian ones may be quite illu- sory. It is, after all, known that Egypt was inhabited in palaeolithic times and something must have hap- pened to the inhabitants! It is indeed possible that sites such as Khartoum, Fayum, and Merimde fill the later part of the chronological gap. Culturally only the Khartoum Mesolithic-Neolithic sequence represents the progression from nomadic hunting to a more settled, possibly agricultural economy with animal breeding. But even this Khar- toum sequence is fully "neolithic" from the point of view of pottery-making, and there is not sufficient evidence to show conclusively that the culture is really very early rather than chronologically late and cul- turally degenerate. The Fayum culture, with possibly domesticated animals, must have received its wheat, barley, and flax from elsewhere, and it is striking that, apart from what is known about the distribution of wild plants, which points to somewhere outside Egypt, the archaeological material in these early Egyptian sites gives no more specific indication of their affinities, although in the Fayum there appear to be archaeolo- gical links with somewhere in the West. It is intriguing to ask why no early neolithic sites, to correspond to those of Lower Egypt, are known in Upper Egypt, for it is unlikely that such sites would not have survived somewhere in the south (in con- trast to the Delta). One answer to this would be to assume that infiltration from outside, via the north of Egypt was necessary for the stimulation of post- palaeolithic Egyptian development. But this is pure speculation, and the absence of early Upper Egyptian neolithic sites may well be due to inadequate survey or excavation, or possibly to the fact that such sites were actually in the fertile region of the Nile and have since been covered (Kaiser 1956; Butzer 1959a). Another problem is the lack of convincing parallels between the North Saharan and Saharan neolithic cul- tures, and the majority of -the neolithic Nile Valley cultures, such as Khartoum, Merimde, Fayum and el Omari; and yet it might be thought that some connec- tion must surely have existed. Similarly it still remains to assess the real importance of the two cultures of Fayum Neolithic and Khartoum Neolithic having gouges and using amazon-stone for the manufacture of beads. This must await the identification of their respective sources; should they prove really to be the same and should the source show connections with any North Saharan or Saharan neolithic, this would prove of the utmost significance. The real relationship between the Badarian and Naqada I cultures still remains to be established. It is impossible to state that the Badarian was everywhere earlier than Naqada I, and also impossible to assess how far the Naqada I culture was really typical of the whole of predynastic Egypt. What does seem clear is the absence of sharp distinguishing marks, or breaks, between these two cultures, which appear closely related. How far these general similarities can really be taken to show that one culture was a development of the other rather than both were descendants of a common ancestor is impossible to say. (The Tasian does not qualify for such an ancestor). The absence of any convincing evidence for Lower Egyptian development at a time corresponding to the Badarian-Naqada I sequence, although a presumably earlier large and important site at Merimde is known from Lower Egypt, must be due to accidents of archaeological discovery. The gap remains to be filled, and cannot be taken as convincing evidence for the southern Egyptian development of the Naqada I cul- ture. And yet the old view that the Fayum-Merimde and Badarian-Amratian sequences represent the Hamitic (African) part of the later Egyptian Hamito- Semitic civilization still has a curious fascination. The only archaeological evidence to support such a view would be a sequence deriving from the Khartoum complex (African), developing into the Badarian, which in turn grew into the Amratian. But such ar- chaeological evidence is lacking; nothing much is known to bridge the gap between the Khartoum cul- tures and the Nubian A Group. As should by now be recognized, terms such as Hamitic and Semitic are better reserved solely for linguistic studies; there is nothing to indicate the nature of the languages spoken by the people of these various cultures, and in any case there is little evidence that modern linguistic groupings reflect cultural unity. Just as there is no real evidence for great cultural change at the time of the introduction of White Cross- lined ware in the Amratian period, so there is no evi- dence for migrations and invasions at the beginning of the Naqada II period. Changes in material culture occur without mass changes in population, and the vigorous development of the Gerzean culture is best viewed as a natural evolution accompanied by stimulus of foreign contacts together with improved techniques. Again, that the real nature of the Gerzean culture is not altogether clear (Butzer [1959a] suggests that sites on the edge of the Nile may have been covered by allu- vium. If this is so the Gerzean may not be the charac- teristic culture of the period); there is very little, beyond negative evidence, to suggest that it arose in the Delta; in fact there may be some significance in the fact that it does not seem to have penetrated there until very late. There may have been a Delta culture, about which we know nothing, which impeded its advance. Virtually next to nothing is known about the socio- Vol. 6 No. 2 April 1965 155</page><page sequence="12">economic, religious and political organizations of Gerzean Egypt although the Hierakonpolis tomb and possibly certain select cemeteries at Naqada and else- where (already in the Amratian) suggest the possibili- ty of nobility. Intensive foreign contacts are certain. In these circumstances, with the additional realization that the rise to Dynastic civilization appears to have progressed rapidly, it may well be that the old view of the foundation of Dynastic rule in Egypt by the in- vasion of a New Race with high cephalic indices is as unfounded as the old idea of invasions to start the Amratian and the Gerzean periods. Negative evidence is always unreliable, and no more than this exists to show that the historic deities and the socio-economic organization of Archaic Egypt did not have a long development in predynastic Egypt. Perhaps the mys- terious Kings of Petrie's Dynasty 0 were chiefs of Gerzean Egypt. Abstract The article attempts to review the predynastic develop- ment of ancient Egypt. The characteristics of the neo- lithic sites of Fayum and Merimde are- summarised and the relations of these "cultures" discussed. In this connection the development at Khartoum is investi- gated. The problems of dating these sites are considered and the possibility of their very early date is noted. The better-documented evidence of development from the Badarian to the late Gerzean periods is presented and the origins of these cultures discussed. The view is put forward that these "cultures" cor- respond to peaceful evolution as opposed to infiltration and domination of one culture by another. The classic views of Sir Flinders Petrie and others are discussed in the light of more recent work and re-analysis of pre- dynastic material. In the concluding section attention is drawn to some of the most important problems and questions which still remain to be answered. The comparative ig- norance about predynastic Egyptian development is attributed, in great part, to the lack of modern scien- tific excavations of predynastic sites. Comments By LIONEL BALOUT* Paris. 24 ii 64 I would like to present 2 remarks: 1 about the use of the term "Meso- lithic" in Africa, especially to qualify the "Wavy Line culture" discovered near Khartoum by A. J. Arkell (1949: 111); the other relating to the supposed connections of this country with the Sahara, in Neolithic times. The definition of "Mesolithic" is peculiar to Europe where it is applied to the "intermediate period between the Palaeolithic with extinct and emigrant animals and the Neo- lithic with present fauna." The extension of this term to African prehistory is therefore "conventional," and we qualify more willingly as "Epipalaeolithic": the continuation of the "anterior mode of the life," based on hunting, fishing and food-gathering (Breuil and Lantier 1951:244). In this mind, I have named the Iberomaurus- ian and Capsian civilizations in North Africa, "Epipalaeolithic" (1955); a 'terminology adopted in the thesis of Abbe Roche (in press) and of J. Tixier (1963). The term "Mesolithic" would not be used in Africa. In particular, as to the "Wavy Line culture" of Khartoum, Arkell states that ". . . There are no sickles and no evidence of agriculture, but there is pottery. . ." (1949:111). In his report of l'Anthropologie (1950:480-81), R. Vaufrey replies: "It is, in my opinion, only a question of words: the lithic implements of -Khartoum are really "Mesolithic", as are always those of the Neolithic of Capsian tradition; but, in Capsian industries as we know them in the Maghreb and in the Sahara, ceramic, rectangles, and trans- versal arrow-heads appear only in assemblages, the Neolithic appurte- nance of which cannot be disputed." The lack of domestic animals (Alimen 1955 :212) is not a sufficient argument. His improper use has led us to consider as Palaeolithic a part of the rock art of the Sahara, where the latest Palaeolithic civilization is the Aterian, the makers of which are very likely Neanderthal men. I prefer the definition I gave in 1955 (p. 450): "Neolithic is a state of civilization... To be a Neolithic man is to practice polishing, bifacial flaking of arrow- heads, ceramics, agriculture and cattle breeding. All this was not learnt at the same time." I believe, as do all French prehistorians of Africa, that "Wavy Line culture" is Neolithic, and not Mesolithic. This label is without chronological meaning. The discovery in the Sahara of potsherds with "Wavy Line" or "Dotted Wavy Line" decoration, suggests a Neolithic different from the Neolithic of Capsian tradition (Vaufrey 1950) and the "Neolithic of Sudanese tradition" (Hugot 1963). The choice of these terms shows that the Neolithic current moved from East to West. All the radiocarbon dates support the contention of the "connections with the Western Step- pes." According to Arkell, the "Meso- lithic" of Khartoum originates about 7000 B.C., a date which is placed, in North Africa, between the Ibero- maurusian of Taforalt, Morocco (eleventh-ninth millennium) and the Capsian (seventh-sixth millennium). Fayum Neolithic would take place in the fifth millennium, Merimde in the fourth, and the Neolithic of Khartoum, about 3300 B.C. All the Neolithic dates obtained in the Maghreb and the Sahara are near this last date (second half of the fourth millennium) particu- larly the "Neolithic of Sudanese tradition" of Meniet (Immidir), with Wavy and Dotted Wavy Line pottery: 3450 B.C. ? 150. The old, tenacious, hypothesis that the Sahara Neolithic and its rock art were relatively early can be accepted no more. The Nile Valley, Greece and Crete, above all the Near East, were Neolithic and contemporary with the Epipalaeolithic civilizations of the Maghreb, the Sahara and even of occidental Europe: "So, there have been, at 1 time, Upper Palaeolithics, Mesolithics and Neolithics, contem- porary with one another.. ."

Much more is, of course, known of Egypt's early connections with Asia, from which came food grains, sheep and goats, the first copper, and prob- ably the veneration of the Great Mother. We know from later periods that African tribes settled in western parts of the Nile Valley, where it was not already in possession of the Egyptians, for the lure of the Egyptian flesh-pots must have been. great even at a very early date. Carbon-14 dating now suggests that the beginnings of the Neolithic revolution were in Asia, but it seems odd that there should be a lacuna of some 3,000 years until similar cultures started in the Nile Valley. Merimde, of which the authors speak with commendable reticence, is better kept out of the picture until more is known about it. Its polished red pottery with strips left uncoloured to receive an incised pattern, its black-topped and black-mouthed types, recall the Nubian A-group, and fragments of headrests suggest that, like the A-group, it still existed in early dynastic times. It is interesting that the authors see a connection between the Neolithic of the Fayum and of Khartoum, since both the stone industries and the pottery are very different. The concave-based arrowheads and bifa- cially worked sickle-blades of the Fayum, and all the other types of flint tools found in Kom W and K, are characteristic of Naqada I. They are found wherever the Naqada I people can be traced, from the neighbourhood of Asyut in the north to Reisner's cemetery 17 near Bahan in Nubia (1908:13 on). The occurrence of beads of amazonite in both Fayum and Khartoum Neolithic is very interesting; it is to be hoped that analysis will show whether both come from Eghei Zumma, or from other known sources in Egypt. The glazed stone beads from Badari are more likely to be imitations of turquoise, which was found with them; no amazon-stone is known from the Badarian. If connections between the Fayum and Nubia via Tibesti exist, this would help to solve the problem of the lack of Naqada I and early Naqada II settlements between Asyut and the Fayum, for it would be a route outside the Nile Valley. It seems unlikely that they should be buried under the Nile mud, for why should these people who avoided the valley proper in Upper Egypt and settled on the spurs of the desert descend into the valley farther north, where it was just as swampy and in- hospitable? The changes which come in with Naqada II are too vital to be explained by development only. As the imported pieces show, there was a connection with Western Asia which had not existed before. Some of the traders who first came-attracted by Egyptian gold, if one may hazard a guess-must have settled in the Nile Valley and there practised their different tech- nique of working flints and made their superior pottery of pure desert clay. Whether eventually they came out on top because of their superior in- telligence and enterprise or through less peaceful means remains a guess; the Naqada II civilisation represents a fusion of the old with the new. The founding of the United Kingdom of Egypt, which led to the rise of the dynasties, seems more of a political event. The famous painted tomb of Hierakonpolis emphasizes the close connection between the Gerzean period and the rise of the dynasties. I wholeheartedly agree with the authors' conclusion that the lack of excavations and research on the spot during the last 30 years is the most important point to emerge from a review of the prehistory of the Nile Valley. By KARL W. BUTZER* Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A. 2 iii 64 This critical review is the first of its kind and has, indeed, been long overdue. It is particularly welcome at this time when the international program of intensified and "final" excavations in Nubia (seriously under- way since 1959) has begun to terminate. Arkell and Ucko suggest that the hiatus between terminal Palaeolithic and advanced Neolithic oultures in Egypt may be more apparent than real, presumably reflecting inadequate excavatiton techniques. The point is well-taken and can be amplified both in view of the 1962/63 excavations of M. A. Baumhoff and H. Walter at Gebel Silsila 2B on the Kom Ombo Plain (report in preparation) and in the light of the paleo-environmental sequence. Since Arkell and Ucko have paid but scant attention to environment problems, some pertinent facts can be raised here. 1. During the late Pleistocene (Wiirm), 3 sequences of Nilotic sediments were laid down in Nubia and Egypt (extending to the Delta), where they show complex lateral intercalations with local colluvia and wadi fill. They are evidence of 3 pluvial substages in Ethiopia, and of several briefer wet episodes in Egypt. Based on detailed field study during 1962/63 and laboratory analyses underway (Butzer and Hansen, un- published) this interpretation is in flat contradiction to recent remarks by Fairbridge (1962). The last geologically significant pluvial climate in the middle and lower Nile Valley (Butzer 1959b) can be set in the last millennia of the terminal Pleistocene, exact age still to be determined by radiocarbon dating. In contrast to the almost ubiquitous Middle Palaeolithic, the Upper Palaeo- lithic (of Sebilian facies, sensu lato) is more localized along the Nile peripheries and in a few of the adjacent wadis. The regional diversity and increasing specialization of these terminal food-collecting groups is notable and certainly related to the rich but restricted riverine environ- ment. 2. Between about 8000 and 5000 B.C., the Nile cut down its bed in Nubia; floods were no greater and probably less effective than today; the Nile floodplain was narrower; and local climate was hyperarid. Arkell and Ucko cite Fairbridge (1962) to the effect of a moister climate at this time: it is interesting that Fairbridge- quite incorrectly-claims to base him- self on my own work. There is, in fact, no evidence whatever of moister conditions either in Egypt or in the Blue Nile area at this time and the geological significance of sites such as at Abka (and Ukma) remains to be shown. Lacking contemporary surface deposits, it is not surprising that sites are almost absent for this period. They would be largely restricted to the floodplain of that time, which has long been buried under more recent alluvium. 3. Roughly contemporary with the European Atlantic, and terminating in Sixth Dynasty times (a little before 5000 to about 2350 B.C.), climate in the Red Sea Hills and northern Egypt was a little moister than now (detailed discussion in Butzer 1959c). The wide distribution of predynastic remains adjacent to the Nile floodplain and in the desert wadis and highlands is not just a coincidence. 4. The apparent lack of predynastic materials within the Delta and in much of Middle Egypt is certainly fortuitous and misleading. Contrary to a widely held opinion, bore profiles show that the Delta was neither a vast swamp nor an extension of the Mediterranean Sea at this time. Alluvium has buried the sites that must have existed (Butzer 1959c). In the "cultural gap" of Middle Egypt the German Archaeo- logical Institute survey of 1958 showed that many pre-New Kingdom sites occur, wherever aeolian activity did not preclude settlement or where sub- sequent alluviation or agricultural practices have not buried or destroyed sites of the former desert margins (Kaiser 1961; Butzer 1960, 1961). Arkell and Ucko regrettably fail to appreciate this fact, and they do not Vol. 6 * No. 2 - April 1965 157</page><page sequence="14">break away from the myth of primeval papyrus swamps and jungle-thickets in the Nile Valley. The floodplain with its raised levees (with open- stocked woodlands) and seasonally inundated alluvial flats (with grass- land and savanna) must always have been the focus of settlement (Passarge 1940; Butzer 1959c). The low ratio of settlement sites to cemeteries on the low desert edge, even in early pre- dynastic times, bears this out. A few more incidental items. It is improbable, on geological grounds, that the Fayum 2-meter shoreline (with Fayum "B") is older than the 10-meter shoreline (with Fayum "A"). In view of the multiple talus beds on the low desert edge between Hemamieh and Badari a little "inverse stratigraphy" is quite possible there. However, physical evidence for a colder climate in Badarian times is lacking. By J. DESMOND CLARK* Berkeley, California, U.S.A. 3 iii 64 This is an excellent summary of what is known of the origins and develop- ment of predynastic culture in the Nile Valley and the authors' interpretation is all the more convincing since it is based on long experience of the region. Regarding Neolithic evidence, it is immediately apparent that the many gaps in knowledge, general lack of stratigraphy, and ambiguous inter- pretation of the few Neolithic sites excavated, make it imperative for the origins and early evolution of the Neolithic to be sought from new sites inside and outside the Nile Valley. The essentially African nature of the cultural equipment of the Fayum and Shaheinab Neolithic is well shown in the paper. This includes the axes and gouges, the bifacial arrowhead and point element, the microlithic forms and the bone points at the southern sites where they persisted into later predynastic times. Other elements can be recognised as of Asiatic origin. The Natufian form of notched arrowhead and bone point in the Fayum, the Heluan retouch to lunates and the domestic plants and animals, all point to undeniable Asiatic influence in northern Egypt. The authors' thesis that the Neolithic in the Nile Valley was in essence an economic and cultural transmutation on the part of the indigenous "Meso- lithic" inhabitants resulting from in- creased and improved trading contacts, and was not the outcome of invasions of the valley by numbers of hostile Asiatics, is a great advance on pre- vious, less convincing, interpretations. The spread of Neolithic culture generally throughout northern Africa can best be explained as the outcome of economic and social adjustment following the fairly rapid diffusion of the pastoral and agricultural way of life from the east, along the Mediter- ranean littoral and into the Sahara from the north and east. What made the spread of Neolithic culture possible at this time and with such rapidity must really have been the climatic amelioration known variously as the Neolithic or the Makalian Wet Phase, which occurred between c. 5500 and 2500 B.C. and is well attested for the Sahara by palaeo- botanical evidence. Not only would this have facilitated movement from southwest Asia into Lower Egypt, but also permitted cattle herders to occupy much of the Sahara. The authors might perhaps have made more of this, for it must have been the most important factor in influencing the speed with which Neolithic culture travelled westwards and southwards. The dates for the Neolithic in the Sahara cluster between 3500 and 3000 B.C. but there are a few older, sixth millennium dates, notably from Mori's Uan Muhuggiag site (Mori and Ascenzi 1959:125-48 and personal communication) in the Acacus Mount- ains; and the earliest date for the Neolithic in Cyrenaica is 4420 B.C. from Haua Fteah, layer VIII. In view of these dates, and if the dating of the Amratian to the earlier half of the fourth millennium B.C. iS correct, the Fayum Neolithic must surely be older than 4400 B.C. Indeed, it must give reason for surprise that elements of Neolithic economy present in south- west Asia as early as 7000-8000 B.C. had not infiltrated the Nile Valley and the Fayum before 4400 B.C. In Cyrenaica the local Neolithic is seen as a development from the Upper Palaeolithic et Tera blade culture (McBurney 1960:192-5, 238), while in the Sudan the immediate predecessor is Arkell's Khartoum Mesolithic, with cultural connections that associate it with the lakes region of north central Africa. In each case the immediate predecessor was local. In the Egyptian secton of the Nile Valley, 1 immediate predecessor of the Neolithic is likely to have been a culture of local epi- Levallois ancestry. It is, however, difficult to see in the inadequately known late Sebilian a potential ancestor of the Fayum Neolithic. Therefore, until we have in Egypt a site or sites showing the stratigraphical transition from the Mesolithic into the Neolithic, little further progress can be made in the valley itself; it might be more productive to concentrate in- vestigation on the regions east of the lower Nile and west of the Gulf of Suez where cave, as well as open, sites must exist. A good stratified cave site should provide evidence of the rate at which exotic influences made themselves felt. Even if it should not yield the same knowledge of the socio-economic pattern as an open site, it migh,t be expected to show the nature of the immediately preceding cultural stage and whether this could have been the basic element out of which grew the earlier Egyptian Neolithic. Although the evolved epi-Levalloisian must have been 1 of the lithic elements present in the valley in immediately Neolithic times, I suspect, as do also the authors in their remarks about the Lupemban ancestry of the Khartoum and Fayum Neolithic, that there was another ethnic element present that found cultural expression in a merging of Central African Lupemban and North- west African Aterian bifacial and tanged artifacts. It does not seem likely, from what we now know, that the axe-gouge element in the Neo- lithic could be derived from the epi- Levalloisian/Sebilian. The possibility should not be overlooked, however, that some of the evolved "Levallois- type" cores with fine bifacial edge retouch might have served a twofold purpose, being used as well for chopoing and adzing, as were many of the discord and oval prepared cores found with the later Middle Stone Age and the Magosian south of the Sahara (Clark 1958:144-52). Evidence exists for Lupemban forms in the Sudan at Kor Abu Angor, and the Columbia University Expedition to Nubia reports such forms between Wadi Halfa and Abri. The large bifacial foliate element in the Khargan Aterian isz-also more at home in the Lupemban. Together with the presence of the Aterian in the Libyan Sand Sea, in Tibesti, Wanyianga and at Kharga, this may be taken to indicate that in late Pleistocene times there was movement of the Aterian both south and east across the Sahara and of the Lupemban northwards into the Nile Basin. It is even possible that earlier peopling of these 2 regions provided the ancestral stock for the "Hamitic" and Negroid populations which the rock art and skeletal material show to have been present during the Neolithic Wet Phase. If the amazon-stone beads with the Fayum Neolithic came, as the authors suggest, from north of Tibesti, and if the Wavy Line pottery from Meniet, northwest of Hoggar, is related to the Khartoum Mesolithic pottery, as it must be, then these facts imply a freedom of movement in both directions over a vast distance. This would have been made possible by the improved environment of the "Wet Phase" and could equally well have given rise to a movement into the Nile Valley by peoples living west or easit of the river, once the advantages of a Neolithic economy in such a milieu became manifest. There is not 158 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT the slightest evidence from the Horn to suggest that the Saharan Neolithic was the outcome of a nomadic invasion from southern Arabia. The few Neo- lithic cultural elements found in the Horn can only be derived from, rather than ancestral to, the Saharan Neo- lithic which is itself basically African. The Neolithics of the Nile Valley and of the Sahara are so interrelated that they need to be studied as a unit. This is speculation, however, on extremely slender evidence, and the authors rightly show the absence of well-excavated sites as the chief handicap to knowledge of the origin of the Egyptian Neolithic and pre- dynastic. As long as this sorry lack of proper stratigraphy and properly ex- cavated settlements remains, we are likely to learn little more of the origins of the Egyptian Neolithic. I hope, also, that this critical and stimulating review will result in a systematic in- vestigation of localities, in the valley and the surrounding desert, which will provide the basic factual evidence that is lacking. The various investigations being undertaken in connection with the building of the Aswan High Dam should do something toward filling the lacunae. By RHODES W. FAIRBRIDGE* New York. 29 iii 64, The authors have established a valid point in attributing the lack of infor- mation about predynastic Egypt to the lack of scientific excavation. Clearly, we scientists are only human, and it is easy to be tempted to spend our time looking at the unquestionably more colorful material of the post-Neo- lithic. But in truth, the predynastic record is quite plentiful and not less fascinating. In the middle Nile, essentially from Khartoum to just below Aswan, this record is largely displayed in alluvial terrace deposits, and the publications of Arkell, Myers and others have al- ready established evidence of an in- teresting cultural sequence. My pre- liminary reports on the Wadi - Halfa area (1962; 1963; 1964) will be followed by a more comprehensive report of the Nile River evolution, but it should be stressed that we have barely scratched the. surface of this promising field. Arkell and Ucko comment on the curious gaps in the record in the Delta region. I would stress that although Aswan is above the limit of influence of glacial sea, level oscillations, in Lower Egypt these will dominate the availability of the river-alluvium for human ecologic requirements. A certain date is critical: 4000 B.C. Prior to that time, the level of the Mediterranean was progressively lower, until about 15,000 B.C., when it lay about 100 meters below present Mean Sea Level. Since this critical date of 4000 B.C., the sea level has been periodically somewhat higher, forcing the littoral or riparian population out of the Delta margins. Sea levels up to 3 meters above the present would cause ex- tensive backflooding, so that the timing and location of the Merimde settlement seems to be no chance phenomenon. Minor oscillations of sea-level and climate may be expected to control the cultural records all along the great river. Since we believe that the Ethiopian rainfall is basically related to net solar radiation, it should be high when sea-level is high. We have a fairly good record of the latter over the last 10,000 years, although some of the oscillations are still doubtful. The so-called "Fairbridge Curve" (actually roughed out by various workers well before this writer was born) is still far from infallible, but so many confirmatory data are coming in (with C-14 dates) from regions as remote as Vietnam, Madagascar, and Peru, during the last year or 2 that its main features seem to be justified. In any riparian Nile settlement, or even nomadic culture, it is evident that if we have a low rainfall period and the river floods are low, the artifacts and fireplaces will be sited down on the lower mud flats. These remains will be swept away in the next high flood cycle (which may last several centuries), and the camp-sites will shift to higher ground. It is evident, there- fore, that we must expect an inter- rupted record as recorded by Arkell and Ucko. By WERNER KAISER Berlin. 31 i 64 The overview which Arkell and Ucko give is excellent. Since our insights diverge only incidentally, there is nothing to add. By ROBERT A. KENNEDY* Oxford, England. 16 iii 64 I cannot quarrel with the first page and, indeed, it is a pleasure to see that the authors emphasize the complete lack of evidence for domesiticated stock in the Fayum. This question of domestic stock and particularly domestic cattle, is of the greatest importance; I shall return to it later. The loose statement that arrowheads of Fayum hollow-base type are known widely in the Sahara is, however, un- acceptable. Hollow-base arrowheads are widely distributed in the Sahara, but those of Fayum type are extremely rare. Almost all are on a smaller, neater scale, evolved and demonstrably later than those of the Fayum A (unless it is much later than the rather unsatisfactory radiocarbon dates lead us to believe). I know of only 1 arrowhead from' the Sahara exactly comparable to those of the Fayum A- from the plain of Tamesna south of the Hoggar (in the collection of the Centre de Recherches Anthropologiques, Pre- historiques et Ethnographiqzues, Musee Bardo, Alger)'. There are 1 from Seguedine south of Djado (Popov collection, Ashmolean Museum), some from the Fort Flatters area north of the Tassili n'Ajjer (Hugot 1957) which approach the scale of the Fayum ones, and 1 from Kharga (Caton-Thompson 1952). Arkell's claim that the gouge is derived from the Upper Palaeolithic Lupemban culture of the Congo is most intriguing, but full of problems, and made no easier by his admitted failure (Arkell 1959; 1964) to show how it appears in identical form in the Fayum, in the Tenere and at Neo- lithic Khartoum. It now appears to be later in the Tenere and at Khartoum than in the Fayum-again assuming its valid priority. Could not the gouge have been invented independently in the Fayum, as the distinctive hollow- base arrowheads seem to have been? As to the suggestion that the Fayum Neolithic B is a precursor of the Neo- lithic A-associated with a rising and not a falling lake; surely this dis- regards the geological evidence. Or does it? The implications are drastic and need the comments of a geologist. Superficially, the idea has a lot to recommend it on artifactual grounds. But apart from seeming to disregard completely the geological/archaeolo- gical evidence, it suggests too early a date for the Fayum Neolithic B. More- over, it ignores the problem of when domestic cattle arrived in- Egypt; the Fayum Neolithic B people may have been cattle pastoralists (as I shall show elsewhere, partly on the basis of a distinctive and intrusive non-Africa arrowhead occurring with their assem- blage and in other areas, in significant circumstances). There has been too much play with radiocarbon dates of late. There are 1 To my friends and colleagues in the Musee de l'Homme, Paris, and in the Centre de Recherches Anthropologiques, Prehistori- ques et Ethnographiques (C.A.R.A.P.E.), Le Bardo, Alger, my gratitude for the generous and unstinted help I have received is more than can be expressed here. Only Arkell himself knows how much I owe to him. I am also grateful to the Editor and Hum- phrey Case of the Ashmolean Museum for the opportunity to read in proof such a stimulating paper.

Vol. 6 No. 2 April 1965 159</page><page sequence="16">still far too few of them for northern Africa and Egypt (and most of the samples are inherently unreliable) for them to be any support or substitute for penetrating archaeological research. There is 1 glorious exception, how- ever: McBurney's site of Haua Fteah in Cyrenaica (McBurney 1960). Here, we have something to go on. There are enough dates from this site to provide their own "built-in" check. The Egyptian dates seem to be of little use as yet (Smith 1964). Those of Arkell at Shaheinab must be suspect (through no fault of his own), though archaeologically they appear to be acceptable (i.e., the average of the 2 available: Arkell 1953). But he him- self would not accept this! French dates from the Sahara also appear to be satisfactory (Mission Berliet 1962; Hugot 1963); as do Mori's dates from the Acacus mountains (Mori 1960). Buit it is merely pleasing to find that they agree broadly with one's archaeolo- gical conclusions so far. Arkell claims that Wavy Line ware was found at Meniet, but this is not strictly so. Wavy Line there is merely that type which occurs on Dotted Wavy Line ware occasionally (of later Khartoum "Mesolithic"), as, e.g., at Richard's site (MS) of Laouni 2, south of Tamanrasset, and apparently even farther to the west near Dakar. Furthermore, the radiocarbon date for Meniet seems to confirm its contempor- aneity with the predynastic period in Egypt (e.g., c. 3450B.c., not 3430 B.C.; Hugot 1963). If Arkell claims his "Late Khartoum Mesolithic pottery" exis,ts in the Hoggar, this immediately invalidates his claim for its early date, for the sites in the Sahara all suggest a predynastic date at the earliest. Burnishing frequently occurs on the Dotted Wavy Line sherds-more often inside and before decoration if on the outside, also a red wash. But burnishing is not almost the rule as in the Khar- toum Neolithic, and in the Sahara it is clearly not a distinguishing faotor, as at Shaheinab. Moreover, over-burnish- ing only seems to occur at Bailloud's site of Delebo (Arkell 1962) in southern Ennedi (comparatively near to Khartoum and Shaheinab) where the sherds also display the crushed grit-tempered fabric typical of the Khartoum "Mesolithic"/Neolithic cul- tures, but completely alien to virtually all Saharan Neolithic wares, whether of Khartoum potting tradition or later. This at once suggests that the appearance in the Khartoum "Meso- lithic" of the grass-itempered Black Fracture ware is the result of a return contact from the west (probably Tibesti-Ennedi) late in the span of that culture. But sLince over-burnishing clearly does not come from the west, might it not also have been acquired (not invented) by the Khartoum Neo- lithic? And from whom but the Badarians? However, this might have been a 2-way exchange: Burnishing acquired by Khartoum Neolithic; ripple-burnishing acquired therefrom by Badarians through continued contact. I oannot see the point of Ucko's quotation of a radiocarbon date of c. 7300 B.P. for a "camp-fire site" at Ukma if "no artifacts, if any" are known from it. Is this a straw in the wind for Arkell?! Surely Brunton did not confuse Black Incised pottery with his Tasian beakers; they are totally different wares, the latter of Mediterranean tra- dition, decoratively speaking, like some of Ucko's figurines (Ucko 1962). On the "Conclusions," one must be brief. The absence of well-excavated sites is an important point, not only in the Nile Valley but in the Sahara, though Hugot (1963) and Bailloud (Arkell 1962) have done great work recently. However, the absence of any sites in the Nile Valley is a serious problem, unless thiis "camp-fire" at Ukma is one to be reckoned with- and I find it hard to imagine how anyone would waste the radiocarbon process on unassociated material. Where today are the prehistoric archaeologists interested in Egypt? It is suggested that Khartoum, the Fayum and Merimde "fill the later part of the chronological gap." But do they? Merimde is clearly very late or an archaeological mess, and either way fills no gap. Incidentally, there seem to be definite and strong con- nections (on pottery evidence-"punc- tured ware") between Merimde and the Tibesti-Ennedi region. Is it possible that someone competent could revisit Merimde and sort this out? I under- stand that Baumgartel is now preparing a complete reassessment of Merimde, but only on the basi's of the previously excavated material. Let us not question so harshly the superb work of Caton-Thompson and Gardner (1934) until we have much more evidence from Egypt. The Fayum Neolithic does not fill a gap because it is clearly an intrusive culture, and there is nothing yet between it and the areas and cultures from which it may have sprung. The retarded Upper Palaeolithic nature of Egypt seems manifest and stimulation from outside does seem to appear: Witness the "Helwan industry," which seems in- disputably Natufian. And the Khar- toum "Mesolithic" culture is the first acceptable sign of an advanced culture in-and surely entering, not indigenous to-the Nile Valley. But it does not appear to be very early; certainly, at Khartoum, not before the sixth mil- lennium B.C. and probably only in the fifth. The Neolithic is the great format,ive period in northern Africa, but ex- tending its influence into the south and even affecting the human pattern as we know it today (not forgetting the Iron Age which can now be seen, in some respects, as but an extension of the Neolithic). The problem, in Egvpt as in Africa as a whole, is a Neolithic one. There are many vital questions which can only be answered by properly conducted field-work. To avoid the mistakes of the piast and reap results, a team is needed, such as that of Robert Braidwood in the Near East, consisting of an archaeo- logist's zoologist, geologists, a physical anthropologist, archaeologists, and a specialist in rock art. The Mission Berliet Tenere-Tchad has produced results of enormous value (Mission Berliet 1962). Can we not have some- thing approaching this in the eastern Sahara? Is it not long enough since the excellent pioneer work of Bagnold, Myers, Peel and Winkler (1939) in the Libyan Desert and Kennedy-Shaw (1936). (Incidentally, the archaeolo- gical finds resulting from their ex- peditions have not yet been fully published, but I shall be responsible for those of Kennedy-Shaw.) The eastern Sahara, Egypt, and the Libyan Desert need the attentions of a team such as is proposed above, but the Egyptian evidence may be the more d'sturbed or the deeper buried, while in the desert regions we shall certainly find much that bears directly upon Egyptian prehistory. And it is in these- now desiccated regions that we shall also find the evidence of the first cattle pastoralists, as the finds of Myers and Winkler suggest (Myers collection: Musee de l'Homme, Paris; Winkler 1939), even thiought a dairy economy leaves little trace behind it! Lastly, while scholars fall over each other before the Aswan scheme, who is pursuing the problems of the Western Desert in the van of Egypt's "New Valley" project? There too, the evidence will soon become hopelessly disturbed, as in the Old Valley. By JAMES MELLAART* Istanbul, Turkey. 20 i 64 As a former student of Egyptology I can only regret the fact that so little new information is coming out of Egypt. At the same tilme, however, the attention now being given the rest of Africa north of the Sahara is most welcome and may in time redress the archaeological balance between Egypt and its neighbours. In the present review article we are presented with a pioture of predynastic development not only in Egypt, but in the Nile Valley, which includes for the first time the pioneer work done by A. J. Arkell in the Sudan. It also opens up wide ramifications of these early 160 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT cultures with the central highlands in the Sahara, a region of great artistic if not archaeological achievement. A map showing connections with the Khartoum area might not have been amiss, for few Near Eastern ar- chaeologists are familiar with the central Sahara. As, after 15 years of Anatolian ar- chaeology, my views on early Egypt are somewhat "rusty," I shall com- ment only on what has bearing on the problem of Near Eastern relations with Egypt. To decide at this moment whether the Nile Valley lay outside the mainstream of Near Eastern Neo- lithic-Chalcolithic development is surely premature, the more so as the material on which such an opinion would be based is about 60 years old. As late as 1956 (Seton Lloyd 1956; Goetze 1957) Anatolia was considered to lie outside it, and only 2 ex- cavations, those of Hacilar and Chatal Hu'yu'k, have caused a complete reversal of opinion (Mellaart 1958- 1961). Since the war, archaeology in the Near East has been in a state of flux; the first decade produced such new cultures as an aceramic Neolithic at Jarmo and Jericho, the second aceramic Sesklo, Hacilar, Chatal Hui- y'k, Beidha, Tepe Sarab, and Alikosh. Old theories, such as that of the "Fertile Crescent" or "Hilly flanks zone of the Fertile Crescent" as sole breeding grounds of civilisations, have been rudely shattered and old termi- nologies uprooted. Archaeological "armchair" theories of orderly pro- gress, propounded with almost Victorian naivete, of single origins and widespread diffusion from a common centre (e.g., in pottery making or metallurgy) have been dis- credited by the emergence of new facts. Hocus pocus with C-14 dates is a fashionable game, and their un- critical use is responsible for many an unwarranted theory. Many archaeolo- gists blithely use single dates without discrimination, be they obtained from fresh digs, from samples taken out of the side of trenches long after ex- cavation, or from the shelves of museum cases in the soot-laden atmosphere of Europe, for building their chronologies. We are asked to believe that the first known Neo- lithic in Egypt (Fayum), is as late as the Danubian in Central Europe- on the basis of C-14 dates, of course; whereas just across the desert in south Jordan a Neolithic flourished in the early seventh millennium (Kirkbride 1960, 1963). The question that should be asked is not "Is it just possible?", but "Is it likely?", and the obvious answer is no, however tenuous the relatjions between Egypt and the Ne r East may have been. One is reminded of the J ericho-Jarmo controversy (Kenyon and Braidwood 1957) about dates and theories (but few facts), a controversy which only showed that single C-14 dates can be unreliable. New ones from Ukma (5340 B.C.) and Uan Muhaggiag (5500 B.C.) in Acacus (Mori 1963) near the Tassili n Ajjer, show the presence of cultures in North Africa at dates earlier than those which have been obtained so far from Egypt, without proving their anteriority. Few Egyptologists are willing to accept the C-14 dates from Egypt at face value, and in this they are undoubtedly right. Perhaps the most important con- tribution to Egyptology in the last 20 years is the increasing amount of evidence that suggests that the Egyp- tian development had an African, not a Near Eastern origin. For links of Egypt with its nearest eastern neighbours, Palestine and Jordan (the archaeological knowledge of which has increased immensely in the last 20 years), no single significant scrap of new evidence has been found. The few Helwan flints do not make an "Egyptian Natufian"; the Neolithic commodity, obsidian, known as far south as Jericho and Beidha, re- mained unknown in Neolithic Egypt; the Fayum or Merimde Neolithic pottery shows no links with that of its eastern neighbours at all. The ivory figurines of the Beersheba culture (dated 3500-3200 B.C.), roughly con- temporary with the Gerzean in Egypt, can hardly be brought in contact with the Badarian, which is generally con- sidered to be much older (c. 4000 B.C. or earlier). Its copper working can hardly be derived from that of the Beersheba culture (unless that is dated too low) and may be local. Its figurines and spoons remind one of Hacilar in Turkey, a resemblance which is probably as fortuitous as that of the Namazgah figurine from Turkestan. More important than traces of tenuous contact between Egypt and Palestine prior to the Gerzean period are the introduction of agriculture and animal domestication, for here we are on much safer ground.. Neither the wild ancestors of wheat, barley, etc., nor those of sheep and goat (as against cattle and pig) are native to North Africa, and their presence in Egypt is artificial and man-made. Charles A. Reed's severe criticism (Braidwood and Howe 1960) is more than justified. His conclusion of the lamentable state of affairs in Egypt is worth quoting: No domesticated goat or dog is attested before the Amration, no sheep before the Gerzean, and no cow or pig before the First Dynasty. Osteological proof is und\oulbtedly necessary, but it is un- likely that the "sheep or goat" at Fayum was introduced as a wild species (not being native). The paintings of the "cattle period" in the Tassili n Ajjer and Acacus (C-14, c. 3500 B.C.) suggest the presence of domesticated animals long before. The Fayum flax, woven into a rough linen, reminds one that fliax was grown in the Halaf culture (fifth millennium) of North Mesopotamia, a possible origin for this plant (Helbaek 1959). Far more important are the food crops: emmer wheat, grown through- out the Near East and the Aegean; 6-row barley and hexaploid wheat (club wheat), the latter 2 not native to Mesopotamia, Syria, or Palestine, but conspicuous at Hacilar and Chatal Hu'yuik according to H. Hel'baek (private letter). From there they spread to Crete and Europe and, it now appears, Lower Egypt. These northern contributions show that the Egyptian development was not a completely African affair. The importanceof hunting fromNeo- lithic to Gerzean should be noted, but hunting never went out of fashion, just as the other forms of food collec- tion continued side by side with stock- breeding and agriculture. To this day some of our choice foods are "gathered" that way: venison, boar, oysters, fish, mushrooms, snails, nuts, and many wild fruits and berries. The presence of numerous hunting weapons, as, e.g., at Chatal Huiyuik in the seventh millennium B.C. should not blind one to assume that foodgathering was more important than food pro- duction. Particularly interesting is the use of a light or bluish green stone amazonite from Tibesti, for the manufacture of beads and pendants. This has in- teresting parallels with the use of similarly coloured apatite in Neolithic Anatolia, and with that of liapis lazuli from the fourth millennium B.C. onwards through the countries of the Fertile Crescent and Iran. In each case it is evidently the magic colour which was eagerly sought, a tradition which survives throughout the Near East and the Aegean in the "blue bead" worn for protection. It is in- teresting to note that the Badarian blue-green glazed steatite fore- shadows the use of blue faience in early dynastic times, in both cases acting as a substitute for amazonite or lapis. The Egyptian name for faience "the Libyan," points to amazonite, not lapis, which came from Badakhshan in the east. There is no reason to suggest that the Neolithic pottery of Egypt and Sudan, or the use of copper in Badari, must necessarily be technical processes derived from the Near East. There is a schSool of archaelologiical thought Vol. 6 * No. 2 April 1965 161</page><page sequence="18">which holds that a technological process once invented almost auto- matically and within a short time limit spreads to its neighbours. I believe that this idea is fallacious; neither the use of pottery, nor metals, nor the potter's wheel, spread like wildfire. Often we are up against technical incompetence, lack of raw materials, closely guarded techniques, stubborn conservatism, or sheer poverty. The human mind is perfectly able to ob- serve and discover the use of clay or native copper in more than 1 place and we know that the Egyptians were not mentally retarded! Pressure flaking of flint knives/daggers offers another instance of the same nature; the Gerzean knives use the same tech- nique as the Chatal Huiyu'k daggers 3,000 years earlier, but the connection is fortuitous. One can quote other examples; in a human skull at Chatal Hu'yuk VI, the brain has been removed and cloth substituted; in the wall paintings of Level IV, men are painted red and women white, bodies in front view, heads, arms, and legs in profile; but though superficially one notices resemblances with Egyptian processes of mummification and painting, such unsupported evidence amounts to little. If we knew more about numerous other peoples, we might well find that such practises were far more widespread than we can now guess. Egyptian art is quite different from that of the Near East and should perhaps be studied in con- junction with that of the Tassili n Ajjer and other North African regions. The few similarities noted at Chatal Hu'yu'k probably derive from a com- mon Mediterranean art tradition of the Upper Palaeolithic, which as yet awaits discovery. Further, it should be noted that in religion Egypt shows most clearly its African origins. Nowhere in the Near East do we find animal-headed (or masked) deities, nowhere such a strong male element in the cult. The cult of the Mother Goddess, predominant in the Neolithic-Chalcolithic Near East, is hardly noticeable in Egypt, and the female figurines do not seem to portray the Mother Goddess so much as to serve as substitute concubines for the dead. Finally, it would appear that the ancient Egyptian considered himself nearer to his western, Libyan (and even his southern, Nubian) neighbours, than to the "vile Asiatics," that recurrent term of contempt that may enshrine his deeprooted African suspicien of the Near East. By RICHARD PITTIONI* Vienna. 15 i 64 The paper is an excellent review of our knowledge about the prehistoric cultures and stages in Egypt and Nubia. It works out into the open problems, and the necessities for future researches in the field. The publication of the article is highly appreciated by every student in the field of African prehistory. By PHILIP E. L. SMITH* Toronto, Canada. 1 iii 64 This is a timely paper in view of the recent renewal of interest in archaeo- logical work in Egypt and the Sudan resulting from the Nubian salvage campaign. If it succeeds in focussing attention on the present anomalous situation of the Egyptian Neolithic and predynastic, and especially on the dubious chronological structure which has been all too readily accepted as firmly established, it will have accomplished something worthwhile. Certainly I found some of the authors' suggestions, such as the possibility that Fayum B preceded Fayum A, startling at first, but provocative. But, as they emphasize, the most urgent need in the Nile Valley Neolithic now is for a good series of early sites. Of course, perhaps there really is nothing as early as the Levantine, Mesopotamian, Anatolian and Balkan early food- producing levels. Certainly nothing like a pre-pottery Neolithic has yet been identified, unless the Fayum B or the poorly known Bedouin Micro- lithic of Kharga Oasis (Caton-Thomp- son 1952) can qualify. But the in- creasing evidence from Libya (both desert and Mediterranean zones) of the spread of a Neolithic in the early fifth and even sixth millennia B.C. makes it even more curious if the Nile Valley were really blocked off at this time from external developments. Arkell and Ucko have necessarily had to concentrate on the problems involved in the Neolithic and succeed- ing predynastic cultures. I find equally intriguing the problems concerning the immediate natural and cultural back- drops to the Neolithic, i.e., the Nile Valley in late Pleistocene and early Holocene times. As the authors say (p. 155), "Egypt was inhabited in Palaeo- lithic times and something must have happened to the inhabitants!" No one today seriously advocates the old hypothesis of Jacques de Morgan, that a great cataclysm eliminated the Palaeolithic groups before the arrival of the Neolithic peoples from outside; yet an embarrassing hiatus allegedly lies between the 2 cultural stages. (Arkell and Ucko do not mention the site of Helwan, near Cairo, which is supposed, on rather tenuous grounds, to represent an Egyptian outlier of the Palestinian "Mesolithic" Natufian; but since this locality has been destroyed by expansion of the modern town, and was never methodically in- vestigated, it may be as well not to lean too heavily on this evidence.) However, I suspect that the lacunae between Palaeolithic and Neolithic in the lower Nile Valley (i.e., in Upper and Lower Egypt) may be more apparent than real. There is a generally accepted view that the equivalent of the Upper Palaeolithic in the lower Nile Valley is essentially represented by industries persisting in the Levalloisian tradition. The Sebilian of Vignard (1923) is regarded as the classic example of an industry gradually shedding its Levalloisian characteristics at the end of the Palaeolithic and persisting (in a geometric and microlithic phase) into the beginning of the Holocene, when an arid erosion stage set in. If this view is accepted, it is difficult to recognize any close relationships between industries like the Sebilian on 1 hand and the later sub-Neolithic and Neolithic industries on the other for, while geometric forms such as trapezes and triangles are present at Early Khartoum, the latter does not seem to have developed from traditions like the Sebilian. The answer, I think, is that the Sebilian and other "Epi- Levalloisian" groups were not the only late Palaeolithic, early pre-Neolithic traditions in the Nile Valley of Egypt and the Sudan, and the evidence from Kom Ombo in Upper Egypt (where I conducted prehistoric investigations for the National Museum of Canada's Nubian expedition in 1962-63) pro- vides strong support for this view. Kom Ombo is, of course, the classic locality for the Sebilian, and it was here tha-t Vignard identified his 3 Sebilian phases which supposedly develop out of the local Middle Palaeolithic of Levalloisian facies. But prehistorians have not taken sufficient- ly into account the fact that Vignard (although he published it belatedly, 30 years after his field work) did find evidence of other late Palaeolithic or Mesolithic industries at Kom Ombo which were quite unlike the Sebilian: a small sample of a blade and bladelet industry with excellent true burins of various types, and another which he called "Aurignacian" because of its characteristic scrapers and retouched blades (Vignard 1955a, 1955b). At Kom Ombo in 1962-63 we dis- covered a number of Sebilian oc- cupation sites of all phases (including some at Vignard's type-locality of Sebil, of which the last remnants were recently destroyed by bulldozers, transforming the area into arable land for the displaced Nubian population), plus sites containing the 2 non-Sebilian industries which Vignard had noted. But, in addition, we found at least 4 other quite distinct non-ceramic assemblages hitherto unrecognized in Egypt, and some of these occurred in stratified contexts, associated with large quantities of faunal remains. The 162 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT materials, from over 40 sites, are still under study, and radiocarbon datings are being obtained; but it is not premature to state that they show the situation at Kom Ombo, and probably in Egypt generally, to have been far more complex at this time than is usually thought. Not only were there 2 separate and late industries in the Levalloisian tradition (the Sebilian, and another not yet named); there was at least 1 microlithic industry, utilizing delicate blades and bladelets, which resembles certain of those found in Mediterranean North Africa and Palestine, plus 3 non-Levalloisian, non- microlithic industries based on blade and flake tools. Some of the latter may well have persisted long enough to contribute some forms to later tra- ditions in Egypt, e.g., to the Bedouin Microlithic. Certain of these industries seem to be contemporaneous or over- lapping each other, and to some extent they probably influenced each other during their occupations of the Kom Ombo Plain. So Kom Ombo may present a good example of an in- tensively occupied prehistoric "inter- action zone," where the processes of typological and technological exchange may be seen in action. (This com- plexity and diversity should be kept in mind by geologists and others who often tend to class any microlithic, geometric or bladelet tools in Egypt as "Late Sebilian" or "Epi-Levalloisian," and so to date the geological deposits in or on which they are found and the micro-climatological events re- flected in the deposits.) Harpoons, polished stone and pottery are not found, nor is there evidence yet of food-producing in spite of the abundance of grinding stones (some definitely used to grind pigments) in some sites. But it is likely that certain of these late industries at Kom Ombo, which occur during and after the silt- deposition stage of the Nile, will provide some background for the later pre-Neolithic occupations. They may also throw light on the routes by which such industries as the Kenya Capsian, and related forms so out-of- place in East Africa, reached that part of the continent. We must hope that the salvage archaeology currently being done in Sudanese and Egyptian Nubia will clarify this, but more work is required in Upper and Lower Egypt on this horizon before we can say that there was continuity of occupation or of technological traditions between the hunting-fishing-gathering groups and the later food-producing ones. Only then, too, can we verify or disprove Caton-Thompson's hypothesis (1946) that Egypt, even in the late Pleistocene, was divided into a number of cultural provinces made up of regional stone-working traditions. It already seems clear, however, that not all of these traditions were microlithic or rooted in the Levalloisian style. (Since Caton-Thompson believed that this division into distinct culture areas continued through predynastic times to the unification of Egypt. I wish Arkell and Ucko had given us t-heir views of this anthropologically pro- vocative suggestion.) Egypt, it now appears, was far from being a conservative and isolated culture area in late pre-Neolithic times; whether it was in the "mainstream" to which Arkell and Ucko refer (p. 145) is another question, both for pre- Neolithic and subsequent develop- ments. It is to be expected that the "gaps" in the Neolithic to dynastic range of Egyptian prehistory, like those in the late Palaeolithic-Meso- lithic range, can be filled in when more field prospecting is done. While it is doubtful that the origins of the food-producing method of subsistence will be found' in the Nile Valley, it is also unlikely that this region will prove to be as retarded as present evidence makes it appear. By H. S. SMITH* London. 8 ii 64 3 merits in particular distinguish this terse re-statement of evidence. It studiously ignores the unverifiable inferences made about Egyptian pre- history by the late Professor Kurt Sethe, on the basis of his analysis of the religious texts found in pyramids of Fifth and Sixth Dynasty kings and allied material (Sethe 1930). These inferences still dominate accounts of the period in some otherwise fairly reliable modern histories of Egypt. It points out that the negative inferences now frequently made about the rise of civilisation in the Nile Valley, from the absence in its known archaeological record of stages dis- cernible in other lands, may be utterly misleading. The relevant material may not yet have been searched for in the right places. It stresses the complete inadequacy of available material evidence for any coherent account of man's early progress in the Nile Valley and adjacent highlands. Indeed, the article might have been even more trenchant on these last 2 matters. Interpretation of the earliest cultures of the Nile Valley must depend on accurate knowledge of the contemporary climate, ecology, and environment of the whole surrounding region. Few intensive studies have been made of these, and the results have rarely found their way into excavation reports until recently (Caton-Thomp- son and Gardner 1934; Arkell 1949, 1953a; Mond and Myers 1937 among the honourable exceptions). If, as growing evidence suggests (Fairbridge 1963, Arkell is right in postulating higher rainfall, a higher Nile, a much wider fertile area in Neolithic times, and swampy conditions in the northern Sudan in Mesolithic times, then evi- dence concerning these cultures must be sought over wide areas to west and east of the Nile Valley now desert. Very little in the way of properly equipped prehistoric survey of the Egyptian deserts has been attempted. It is even doubtful, as the authors point out, whether we yet know how to identify certain types of site under the adverse conditions of the Sahara. Significantly, however, the Columbia University prehistoric survey team at present at work in northern Sudanesq Nubia have immediately begun to find very early sites (Solecki, et al. 1963). If Arkell's view is right, it is clear that, whatever the relations of known cultures to one another, the history must have been one of erosion gradually forcing peoples down into the Nile Valley in search of food supplies. It can immediately be seen from a physical map that our known predynastic sites (except Merimde and Hierakonpolis) are sited upon the rising ground and cliffs above the valley. The date at which communal settlement began in the valley is there- fore crucial in interpretation of these sites. Some human beings have lived on the desert edges at most epochs- even recently robbers maintained themselves there-and it is perfectly possible that pastoralists (perhaps semi-nomadic) were still grazing the hill-country at a time when fully urbanised life was in progress in the valley. Arkell and Ucko clearly accept the probability that there was settle- ment and communal development in the valley at a date considerably earlier than that of any known valley site (except perhaps the equivocal Merimde), but theydecline to define the crucial date. Probably they are wise in our present state of ignorance. Yet the fact that nearly all known Gerzean sites are cemeteries; the existence of rectilinear mud-brick architecture proved by the El-Amrah tomb-model (Randall-Maclver and Mace 1902) and bricklined graves; the preponder- ance of cabined river-boats on Gerzean decorated ware; the presence of cylinder seals; the development of writing palettes into what appear to be royal annalistic documents; the plastic representation of what is apparently the Lower Egyptian crown on a black-topped potsherd (Wain- wright 1923)-these and other in- sufficient, but indicative, data have long persuaded some that urb,an life was in progress in-the valley for at least most of the Gerzean perilod. If Vol. 6 No. 2 * April 1965 163</page><page sequence="20">so, the settlement of the valley may have been considerably earlier; village life could well have been going on there in Badarian-Amratian times. Nothing at present known can, of course, prove this; and conditions were probably different up and down the length of the valley, for the authors rightly stress the geographical dis- continuity of our present evidence. But the theoretical possibility of this hypothesis shows the caution with which the evidence, even of such well- excavated sites as Caton-Thompson's valuable stratified settlement at Hemamiyeh (Brunton and Caton- Thompson 1928), should be viewed, for the sites may be marginal. Arkell and Ucko mention Butzer's theory that many settlements originally outside the inundated area may be beneath the alluvium. On the whole, however, they blame our ignorance on lack of modern scientific excavation and inadequate archaeological survey. Certainly, north of Aswan very little purposeful archaeological survey has been done since the days of Petrie and Brunton, and it is not clear that even they, ahead of their time as they were, searched whole areas systematically, except at Qau and Badari. In the 1 region of the Nile Valley which has been completely traversed by archaeo- logioal survey teams, it is perhaps significant how few predynastic and A-Group settlements have been found, compared with the number of con- temporary cemeteries. Yet an A- Group settlement found by myself (1962) on a cliff-top at Afyeh in 1961, and subsequently dug by an Indian team, contained quite sub- stantial stone huts. Excavators of the competence of Reisner (Reisner and Firth 1910) and Emery (Emery and Kirwan 1935) can certainly not have consistently missed sites of this sort. What is the explanation? Partly, no doubt, wind erosion, partly the move- ment of sand and shifting of dunes- but, chiefly, Butzer's factor: the A- Group settlements may now be under the silt, as are the towns and villages of pre-dynastic Egypt. The importation of modern techniques of survey, ex- cavation and recording into the stu- dy of the prehistory of the Nile Valley is, as these authors imply, vital and urgent, and should revolutionize our view of the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. But digging in the Nile alluvium, below the water-line, for possible predynastic settlements, will be an ungrateful, if not impracticable business. It is perhaps over-optimistic to hope for a complete understanding of the history of settlement of the valley. We should, however, be grate- ful to Arkell and Ucko for underlining the need, and the dangers of pro- ceeding on negative evidence. Reply By A. J. ARKELL and PETER J. UCKO In writing this article we had 3 main aims: 1. To show the great need for further excavation of prehistoric sites in the Nile Valley. We are pleased that 7 commentators agree. 2. To present a general review of predynastic development in the Nile Valley and integrate the classic views of Petrie, revisions of Baumgartel, and reanalyses of Kaiser. We are at a loss what to conclude from the fact that we received no comment on this aspect of our article, not even from Baumgartel! 3. To put forward suggestions for consideration by future workers in this field, e.g., dating the Fayum assemblages. We regret there is no comment by Caton-Thompson. Baum- gartel's suggestions for dating the Fayum to the Naqada I period do not convince us; P. Smith finds our sug- gestion startling and provocative; Ken- nedy asks whether our suggestion does not disregard geological evidence; and Butzer answers that it is geologically improbable but not impossible. This is rather what we expected and hope that geological evidence eventually will provide a conclusive answer. Other- wise, we must rely on archaeological evidence. Only Kennedy objects to our suggestion of the datings of the Fayum assemblages because it would make iFayum B too late; this is really only true if one accepts Kennedy's equation of a type of arrowhead with pastoralism! We do not reply in further detail to Kennedy because we find that (a) answers to his points are in our original article (e.g., Tasian beakers and Black Incised pottery), or (b) he is answered by other commentators (e.g., Helwan: Mellaart, P. Smith; Lupemban: Clark), or (c) he answers them himself (e.g., Ukma). Nor do we comment on Balout's sta- tements, for the terminology adopted is immaterial provided the meaning is defined. We think our meaning with regard to Khartoum is clear (and see Arkell 1953a: 102 for definition). Baumgartel's discussion of the transi- tion from Naqada I to II depresses us. We have tried here to present the evidence for and against peaceful con- tact between Egypt and Asia, and for and against invasions into the Nile Valley. We concluded no good evidence for a foreign invasion to begin the Naqada II phase, but Baumgartel merely states "changes . . . are too vital to be explained by development only," whatever this may mean. In any case, we presented evidence for foreign con- tacts before this period and are encour- aged to note Clark's agreement with our interpretation of it. Baumgartel's evidence for the relationship between Egypt and Asia depends on: grain, sheep, goats, copper, and the Great Mother. Most of these we discussed. Mellaart correctly points out that copper cannot be used thus, also stressing the lack of good evidence for the Great Mother in predynastic Egypt. We agree. Mellaart's other views on the rela- tionship between Egypt and Asia require further comment. First, his "rusty" contact with Egyptology may be why he does not realise that many teachers of Egyptian prehistory now accept that Egypt was not in the main- stream of Near Eastern early develop- ment. We suggest that such a view may be premature. Surely it cannot be pre- mature to do so! Second, Mellaart wishes us to discuss this problem in terms of "Is it possible?" rather than "Is it jusrlkely?" This is exactly what we have tried to do. Third, we are glad he agrees that isolated carbon-14 dates are unreliable. Fourth, of course we agree that many parallels may be accounted for by parallel evolution. We are grateful to H. Smith for a concise presentation of evidence for urbanisation in predynastic times. Several commentators' references to predynastic anthropomorphic figurines call for comment. Mellaart dismisses the possibility of significant parallels between Beersheba and Badarian figurines and thus shows that he has misunderstood our approach. So many Amratian figurines and so few Bada- rian figurines are known that parallels seemingly with Amratian figurines alone may well also have applied to Badarian figurines. Only with more Badarian figurines could we tell. Second, we utilise conclusions from numerical studies of figurines (Ucko, forthcoming), which correspond well with conclusions from a study of other archaeological material. Here we are not dealing with the usual generalised statements a-bout figurines of very different dates bearing "a strong resemblance" to each other (e.g. Mellaart 1960:104) but with a systematic investigation of similarities. 164 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="21">Arkell and Ucko: NILE PREDYNASTIC DEVELOPMENT Predynastic figurines are said by Baumgartel to be evidence for the Great Mother (but what about the males?), while Mellaart interprets them as concubines. So many difficulties are connected with either view that neither can be accepted (Ucko 1962). Finally, we discuss comments on environmental factors. Both Baum- gartel and H. Smith include state- ments in agreement with ours. But we are all contradicted by Butzer. Normally we would defer to the geologist's opinion; however, almost all Butzer's statements are contradicted by Fairbridge. Thus, e.g., Butzer maintains that the Delta was not a vast swamp nor an extension of the Mediterranean, whereas Fairbridge maintains that, after 4000 B.C., the sea level when high forced "the littoral or riparian population out of the Delta margin." What is the poor ar- chaeologist to do? He can only wait for the geologists to agree and hope that in future they will produce evidence, especially when contributing to CA* treatment.
