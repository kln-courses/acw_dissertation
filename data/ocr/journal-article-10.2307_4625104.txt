This, according to Ruskin, is "a falseness in all our impressions of external things," the ascrip- tion of human characteristics to inanimate objects, which takes place when reason comes under the influence of intense emo- tion.' While it is problematic to accuse Hardy of displaying exces- sive humanity toward inanimate objects, he nevertheless explores the pathetic fallacy in both his fiction and his poetry. A closer inspection of the nature of the pathetic fallacy thus serves as a convenient starting point for the consideration of an important aspect of Hardy's work, and indeed of poetry in general. '"To Outer Nature" is a prime example of the pathetic fallacy at work in Hardy's writing. The conception of nature presented in this poem is seemingly opposed to the one most commonly asso- ciated with the romantics. In his commentary to the poem, J. O. Bailey writes: "In his maturity Hardy substituted the Darwinian view of nature for the Wordsworthian."2 As a product of the Dar- winian era, '"To Outer Nature" presupposes and concerns the ir- revocable alienation of self from nature. The poem is an attempt to describe nature as something that was once vibrant and lively and is now dormant and lifeless. Yet to speak of the poem as a break with English romanticism would be misleading. Part of Hardy's romantic inheritance finds superficial expression in this poem through the pathetic fallacy, which Ruskin saw as a pri- mary characteristic of romantic poetry. Throughout '"To Outer Nature," the speaker seeks to reimbue nature with the vivacity and humanity that it once had, both through recalling what it Satoshi Nishimura is a doctoral candidate in English at the University of California, Irvine.</page><page sequence="2">898 Hardy and the Inanimate was and through perceiving what it is. The opening stanzas make this intention clear: SHOW thee as I thought thee When I early sought thee, Omen-scouting, All undoubting Love alone had wrought thee- Wrought thee for my pleasure, Planned thee as a measure For expounding And resounding Glad things that men treasure.3 Here and throughout, the second person ("thee") is used to di- rectly address nature, that is, speak to it as if it were alive and indeed human; it is an instance of apostrophe. The use of apos- trophe draws attention to the thorny relationship between the topic of the poem and the way this topic is expressed in words. The speaker finds nature inert, unable to be "re-awaken[ed]," something from which time has distanced him: Fad'st thou, glow-forsaken, Darkness-overtaken! Thy first sweetness, Radiance, meetness, None shall re-awaken. (lines 21-5) However, in the very act of addressing nature, the speaker enacts a kind of reawakening, rescuing it from time and death to trans- form it into an object of description. In fact, it is difficult to imag- ine a poem about nature in which it would not be "humanized" in some way or another. From this perspective, the pathetic fallacy is something more than a stereotypically romantic way of seeing the natural world, a distortion of truth by emotion. Indeed, the difficulty is more a linguistic than an emotional one, arising from the abundance of "humanizing" terms in the English language and its inherent tendency to humanize what we intend it to de- scribe. In other words, as I will argue using some other examples from Hardy's work, the describing of inanimate objects in an-</page><page sequence="3">Satoshi Nishimura 899 thropomorphic terms is attributable not so much to the affective power of pathos as to the humanizing power of our own lan- guage. As J. Hillis Miller points out, the pathetic fallacy is from a linguistic point of view just a trope, what is in rhetorical termi- nology called personification or prosopopoeia. More important still, as he says, is that "[t]he trope of prosopopoeia ... is even more fundamental to the language of poetry at any time than metaphor or than any other trope. Without prosopopoeia no po- etry."4 Paul de Man too, in discussing Michael Riffaterre's semiotic reading of the Victor Hugo poem "Ecrit sur la vitre d'une fenftre flamande," emphasizes the importance of prosopopoeia as the trope which underlies lyric poetry in general. According to de Man, Riffaterre sees the poem as "an example of descriptive po- etry," arguing that in it the signifier "carillon" is a matrix, or a "donnee semantique," which generates the poetic description by ways of expansion." Yet, quoting the first two lines of the poem ("J'aime le carillon dans tes cites antiques, / O vieux pays gardien de tes moeurs domestiques"), de Man says, '"The apostrophe, the address (O vieux pays .. .), frames the description it makes pos- sible. It is indeed a prosopopeia, a giving face to two entities, Theure' and Tlesprit,' which are most certainly deprived of any literal face." As he goes on to argue, the supposedly descriptive details that constitute the poem "can only occur because a con- sciousness or a mind (l'esprit) is figurally said to relate to another abstraction (time) as male relates to female in a copulating couple (line 5). The matrix, in other words, is not 'carillon' but 'j'aime le carillon,' and this matrix is not a 'donnee semantique' but is it- self already a figure."6 The point at issue is the inaugurating power of personification, the trope of prosopopoeia as "the main gen- erative force that produces the poem in its entirety."'7 The same could be argued for the function of prosopopoeia in 'To Outer Nature." Implicit in any reading of the poem as a poem about nature is the assumption that the way nature is spoken about is inextricable from the way it is spoken to; the mode of address is part of the structure of description. If this means that poetic description presupposes personifi- cation, then more significant still is the fact that personification is something more than one trope among many, bringing into question the supposed boundaries of figurative language. In fact, not only is Hardy inclined to treat the inanimate like the human; he also draws attention to the way personification is an irreduc- ible part of language. The rhetorical strategy of his "The Mother</page><page sequence="4">900 Hardy and the Inanimate Mourns" is a case in point. This too is a poem about nature, and it again involves a trope of prosopopoeia, though the speaker here does not address nature in the same way that the speaker of 'To Outer Nature" does. Here are the first several stanzas of the poem: WHEN mid-autumn's moan shook the night-time, And sedges were horny, And summer's green wonderwork faltered On leaze and in lane, I fared Yell'ham-Firs way, where dimly Came wheeling around me Those phantoms obscure and insistent That shadows unchain. Till airs from the needle-thicks brought me A low lamentation, As though from a tree-god disheartened, Perplexed, or in pain. And, heeding, it awed me to gather That Nature herself there Was breathing in aery accents, With dirge-like refrain, Weary plaint that Mankind, in these late days, Had grieved her by holding Her ancient high fame of perfection In doubt and disdain.... -"I had not proposed me a Creature (She soughed) so excelling All else of my kingdom in compass And brightness of brain "As to read my defects with a god-glance, Uncover each vestige Of old inadvertence, annunciate Each flaw and each stain!" (lines 1-28)</page><page sequence="5">Satoshi Nishimura 901 The personification of nature carried out in the poem is first es- tablished in line 1 with the word "moan," then strengthened as the moan develops through a "low lamentation" into a "[w]eary plaint," so that by line 21, "[slhe" may utter a veritable "sough," and begin to speak. It turns out that the title of the poem, '"he Mother Mourns," is both figurative and literal, and that the poem as a whole revolves around the trope of prosopopoeia. The prosopopoeial power latent in the word "moan" is not suppressed but explored, revealing itself as a tropological pivot of the poem. Thus, in addition to manifesting itself as a poetic convention such as apostrophe, personification provides a clue to the nature of language. As Miller argues, personification or prosopopoeia is not just an indispensable tool of poetry, but also something that can- not be separated from language: "Prosopopoeia, it may be, is the one trope no poet or writer, however strong-minded and literal, can efface from his language . . . because personification is so intrinsic a part of language no writing, however resolutely literal, can avoid it."8 If prosopopoeia is so inherent in language as to be unavoid- able, then it might be argued that the nature of poetry, fiction, and perhaps any kind of writing partakes of it. Hardy seems aware of this importance, or at the very least willing to acknowledge the powerful role that prosopopoeia plays in perception: "In spite of myself I cannot help noticing countenances and tempers in ob- jects of scenery, e.g. trees, hills, houses."9 For Hardy, to perceive is to personify, which implies that his writing not only uses but indeed requires prosopopoeia, and that the fulfillment of this re- quirement makes his writing possible. In his The Return of the Native we may see this process in action on a large scale. Though it is only in the second chapter, appropriately titled "Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble," that Hardy introduces people into his novel, even in the first chapter we are presented with a human character in the form of the personified Egdon Heath. The narrator speaks of "[t]he face of the heath," which "by its mere complexion added half an hour to evening."'1 Yet it is important to emphasize that the personification of Egdon Heath in The Return of the Native is not an attempt to present nature in its substantial condition. For Hardy, personi- fication is more or less an ontologically unfounded illusion, since its primary function is to give a face to that which is without one.1 From this perspective, in Hardy's writing the relationship between people and objects is similar to the relationship between the liv- ing and the dead. Take as an example of the latter relationship</page><page sequence="6">902 Hardy and the Inanimate "Her Immortality," in which the speaker remembers his dead lover, though it is not wholly apparent from the subject matter of the poem that personification will play a significant role. Having come to "the place where last I saw / My dead Love's living smile" (lines 3-4), I lay, and thought; and in a trance She came and stood thereby- The same, even to the marvellous ray That used to light her eye. (lines 9-12) Perhaps in hopes of reuniting with his beloved in the afterlife, the speaker contemplates suicide, but she, now speaking, deters him from completing the act by convincing him that his death would mean the end of her existence, such as it is: 'Think, I am but a Shade! "A Shade but in its mindful ones Has immortality; By living, me you keep alive, By dying you slay me. "In you resides my single power Of sweet continuance here; On your fidelity I count Through many a coming year." (lines 32-40) Now that she is physically dead, only personification grants her continued existence. The speaker's experience of the lover docu- mented in the poem-her presence and speech-is figurative, a product of his imaginative act of restoring subjectivity to a life- less being. This kind of existence resembles that presented in the last paragraph of Hardy's A Group of Noble Dames, in which a group of skeletons and stuffed birds is linguistically reanimated: ''The last member at length departed, the attendant at the mu- seum lowered the fire, the curator locked up the rooms, and soon there was only a single pirouetting flame on the top of a single coal to make the bones of the ichthyosaurus seem to leap, the stuffed birds to wink, and to draw a smile from the varnished</page><page sequence="7">Satoshi Nishimura 903 skulls of Vespasian's soldiery."'12 Nature is subject to a similar kind of animation through personification. Just as the dead are resurrected by means of language, so inanimate objects become human once they are rendered in words. This is the crux of the problem of personification in such texts as '"To Outer Nature," '"The Mother Mourns," and The Return of the Native. Another of Hardy's texts, "Nature's Questioning," deserves closer attention here. This poem too is characterized by the per- sonification of nature, as its title suggests. The subject of the poem is twofold: nature itself, and its act of questioning. In other words, nature is in this poem, as in '"The Mother Mourns," both spoken about by means of personification and allowed to speak through it. Nature's dual existence in "Nature's Questioning" is thus based on a certain rhetorical transition, which is effected in this case through the speaker's description of nature as it appears to him at daybreak: WHEN I look forth at dawning, pool, Field, flock, and lonely tree, All seem to gaze at me Like chastened children sitting silent in a school; Their faces dulled, constrained, and worn, As though the master's ways Through the long teaching days Had cowed them till their early zest was overborne. Upon them stirs in lippings mere (As if once clear in call, But now scarce breathed at all)- "We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here!" (lines 1-12) By using the figure of schoolchildren for the perceived objects, the speaker allows the objects to have human faces which ex- hibit their own emotional responses to the threatening situation in which they find themselves. This instance of the pathetic fal- lacy, in which nature reflects human emotion, is typical of Hardy. As Bailey points out in his commentary to "Nature's Ques- tioning," the terms in which nature is described here are also indicative of Hardy's emotional state, in this case depression.'3 Yet the real issue at stake here, as with the other examples, is</page><page sequence="8">904 Hardy and the Inanimate not the connection between poetic discourse and psychology but, as Allen Tate notices, the epistemological nature of poetic dis- course. While regarding "Nature's Questioning" as epitomizing "a use of metaphor practiced by certain Victorian poets," Tate points out that the poem is epistemologically open to criticism because of its tropological abruptness and inappropriateness.14 He says that the perceived objects in the poem quickly become school children, before they have been sufficiently particularized to be themselves. The transfor- mation of the natural objects into persons is initiated with some degree of tact in terms of simile-"Like chastened children"-that we can accept because not too much is claimed for it at that stage. But in the second stanza what appeared to be simile becomes completed metaphor. We have here, in the terms of Mr. I. A. Richards, an instance of metaphor in which the "vehicle" replaces the "tenor": the natural objects (tenor) are so weakly perceived that the children (vehicle), who appear as the conveyance of their significance, cancel out the natural objects altogether.'s As long as the central trope of the poem is thought of as meta- phor, its effectiveness may be called into doubt, because rather than individualizing the objects, it serves to replace them. The human qualities of the personified objects continue to develop throughout the poem, to the point where, as Tate continues, "the margin of intelligible meaning achieved by the union of the tenor and the vehicle is very narrow."'16 All of this, however, is attribut- able not so much to the misuse of metaphor as to the nature of personification as a trope. What Tate says of "Nature's Question- ing," then, implies at least two things. One is that the poem's primary trope is neither simile nor metaphor but personification or prosopopoeia. It is indeed difficult to ignore the poem's pen- chant for personification, whether treated as a problem inherent in this trope or as a version of the problem of metaphor, because such prosopopoeial tendencies, as Tate's argument also implies, are proper to, rather than imposed upon, the language of the poem. Insofar as prosopopoeia is fundamental to "Nature's Ques- tioning," it is of no use to question its propriety as a trope here. At stake is rather the assumption that the use of prosopopoeia in the poem to describe nature is a matter of taste. At stake also is the accompanying assumption that the poem is about nature in</page><page sequence="9">Satoshi Nishimura 905 the sense that it is a figurative description of something that is itself not figurative. As I pointed out above, "Nature's Question- ing" is about nature as well as "nature's questioning," just as '"The Mother Mourns" is about nature as well as "nature's mourn- ing," or just as 'To Outer Nature" is both a description of nature and an address to it. In other words, nature in "Nature's Ques- tioning" is not only open to figuration but also itself already figu- rative. In this poem, therefore, the distinction between vehicle and tenor is not assumed, but called into question from the very start. Moreover, the replacement of tenor by vehicle that charac- terizes prosopopoeia could be considered part of the nature of language itself, since the bond between personification and the catachrestic aspect of language is so strong that it undermines the distinction between the literal and the figurative. "The literal words themselves are already prosopopoeias," says Miller, "as in those celebrated examples [of catachresis], 'face of a mountain,' 'leg of a table."'17 According to Aristotle, what we call catachresis is a kind of verbal transference, the application of a metaphor to something that can only be metaphorically named: "in naming something that does not have a proper name of its own, metaphor should be used, and [should] not be far-fetched but taken from things that are related and of similar species, so that it is clear the term is related."'8 Thus in Aristotle's view catachresis is based on analogy: Metaphor is the application of an alien name by transfer- ence either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, or by analogy, that is, propor- tion ... Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth ... For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet "sowing the god-created light."19 Here the analogy between the scattering of seed and the scattering of the sun's rays, which has no proper name of its own, is supposed to justify the substitution of the word "sowing" for scattering in the latter case, but what is it that made the analogy possible in</page><page sequence="10">906 Hardy and the Inanimate the first place?20 Aristotle begs the question by assuming analogy or similarity to be a priori: "But the greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor . .. it is the mark of genius, for to make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances."21 For Aristotle, analogy springs from intuition, and lies at the heart of catachresis. On the one hand, the notion that the phrase "sowing the god-created light" is a transferred expression seems reason- able because it is an instance of personification, applying to an inert physical process a term usually reserved for a specifically human activity. On the other, however, the transference does not arise from the analogy between man sowing seeds and the sun dispersing its rays, since this analogy is only possible because the sun is personified, that is, as a result of the transference in question. In this case, catachresis is not something that pro- ceeds from analogy, but a manifestation of personification func- tioning as a prior condition for analogy. In other words, what linguistically enables the sun to sow is not the analogy's human- izing effect but the fact that the analogy is justified by the sun's personification. The analogy does not generate a trope but is it- self already one, a product as well as a part of the process of personification. Aristotle's theory of metaphor, then, calls into question the equation of personification with metaphor. G. W. F. Hegel, in his own theory of metaphor, suggests that personification, having as its partial cause "transferring ... the phenomena, activities, and situations of a higher sphere to the content of lower areas," can take place "if the natural and sensuous is imaged in the form of spiritual phenomena and therefore is elevated and ennobled." By the same token, it is significant that "something spiritual is also brought nearer to our vision through the picture of natural ob- jects." "Yet such illustrations," Hegel adds, "may easily degener- ate into preciousness, into far-fetched or playful conceits, if what is absolutely lifeless appears notwithstanding as personified and such spiritual activities are ascribed to it in all seriousness."22 However, as is implicit in Aristotle's example of catachresis, per- sonification not only results from metaphorical transference, whereby the spiritual and the natural relate to each other, but it also establishes a metaphorical relationship between the two, or is intrinsic-or at work prior--to the transference of the one to the other. In other words, the spiritual and the natural are often personified in such a way that they relate to each other in metaphors. It follows that personification is as it were omnipresent, per- vading our language in its myriad forms, and as such it is often either dismissed as cliche or simply overlooked, especially when</page><page sequence="11">Satoshi Nishimura 907 it simultaneously is and is not figurative. As a trope, personifica- tion may seem to have as its function to provide a secondary, figurative name to an existing object, yet often the primary names and indeed the linguistic existence of personified objects are with- out that personification impossible. This means that the function of personification or prosopopoeia is inseparably linked both to the catachrestic use of language and to the tension between the constative and the performative dimensions of language.23 From this perspective, Hardy's use of personification or prosopopoeia does not appear so odd or haphazard as it might otherwise. For example, as I argued above, he uses prosopopoeia in '"The Mother Mourns" not only to humanize nature but also to put its humanization into action. The same is true of "Nature's Questioning." In this poem as well, as I indicated, the significance of personification or prosopopoeia is twofold. The poem opens with the speaker liken- ing "pool, / Field, flock, and lonely tree" to "chastened children sitting silent in a school," but as the poem progresses, the per- sonified identities of the objects assume greater and greater au- tonomy, to the point where they may themselves speak. This trajectory suggests that the rhetorical power of "Nature's Ques- tioning" lies not in the switching from one trope to another-from simile to metaphor-but in the vacillation between the two func- tions, constative and performative, of a particular trope- prosopopoeia. It is now clear that the turning point of the poem is the third rather than the second stanza: Upon them stirs in lippings mere (As if once clear in call, But now scarce breathed at all)- "We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here!" It is not enough to say that the fact that the objects have aurally manifested themselves completes their personification. Of still greater consequence is the fact that this manifestation becomes not merely a human voice but speech. Insofar as the identifica- tion of the sounds of the objects as human murmuring results from prosopopoeia, this trope serves not only to describe the ob- jects in human terminology, but also to enable them to engage in human behavior. This function of the trope makes it possible, after the speaker has introduced the reader to the predicament in which the objects find themselves, for the objects to speak of their situation in their own voices. This occurs in the last line of</page><page sequence="12">908 Hardy and the Inanimate the third stanza, in which the "lippings mere" of line 9 develop a performative function in addition to their figurative meaning al- ready established. This does not mean that when the objects be- gin to speak, the trope of prosopopoeia used to describe them loses its cognitive value. On the one hand, it is possible to argue that the effect of transferring voice from the speaker to the ob- jects is to deepen our understanding of their personification, but on the other, this personification is performative, allowing the inanimate to speak. The trope of prosopopoeia in "Nature's Ques- tioning" is in this sense catachrestic, that is, it is not just an interpretive gesture on the part of the poet/speaker, but also a necessary precondition for the poem's status as an interpretable text in the first place. The undecidability of the poem, then, arises from the dual roles of its central trope as cognitive instrument and cognitive impasse. In "Nature's Questioning," the problem of personification or prosopopoeia is also embodied in the speech of the objects, as well as in the relation of this speech to the poem as a whole. The objects wonder, "Has some Vast Imbecility, Mighty to build and blend, But impotent to tend, Framed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry? "Or come we of an Automaton Unconscious of our pains? ... Or are we live remains Of Godhead dying downwards, brain and eye now gone? "Or is it that some high Plan betides, As yet not understood, Of Evil stormed by Good, We the Forlorn Hope over which Achievement strides?" (lines 13-24) This utterance consists of figurative substitutions for the unknow- able, "God" being only one of the many possible signifiers for this concept. Hardy constructs this presence as the schoolmaster of the children, who in turn variously refer to it as "some Vast Im- becility," "Automaton," "Godhead dying downwards," and "some high Plan." On the one hand, these substitutions seem to con- verge toward a certain conceptual coherence. On the other, ac-</page><page sequence="13">Satoshi Nishimura 909 cording to Tate, the question is "the figure of the 'master,' who is the personal, anthropomorphic representation of the Unknow- able," not only because "here again the metaphorical vehicle re- places the tenor," but also because "the absentee God of Deism," whose "neglect" is what is at issue, is dramatically but irreconcil- ably transformed into "the God of theism, a personal, if not the Christian, God." Tate goes on, "Even in the magnificent image of the 'Godhead dying downwards' we get a certain degree of con- tradiction between tenor and vehicle: in order to say that God has left the universe to chance after setting it in motion, Hardy can merely present us with the theistic God as blind and imbe- cile."24 Yet this contradiction is not a superficial logical problem but an aspect of tropology, a performatively catachrestic moment that language includes. The concept of divinity is inherently an- thropomorphic, transcending the distinction between the literal and the figurative, as Immanuel Kant observes: "If a mere way of presenting [something] may ever be called cognition . .. then all our cognition of God is merely symbolic."25 "Nature's Question- ing," then, questions rather than presupposes the cognitive reli- ability of language. It is important in this connection to note that the tone of the objects' speech is not assertive but interrogative, consisting entirely of questions, so that the figurative substitu- tions are not absolute. To put it another way, while the utterance uses the figures in an attempt to identify the unknowable, its form implicitly acknowledges their representational provisionality. Hardy himself makes a similar acknowledgment: "A poem of- ten quoted against me . . . is the one called 'Nature's Question- ing,' containing the words, 'some Vast Imbecility', etc.-as if these definitions were my creed. But they are merely enumerated in the poem as fanciful alternatives to several others, having noth- ing to do with my own opinion."26 Neither the speech nor the poem as a whole claims to be a statement of fact. Just as the personified objects pose a series of questions that they are un- able to answer, so the speaker subsequently admits: 'Thus things around. No answerer I," so that any possible lingering claims to truth in the poem remain unsubstantiated (line 25).27 As the end of the poem suggests, the speaker's intention has been to raise questions rather than answer them: Meanwhile the winds, and rains, And Earth's old glooms and pains Are still the same, and Life and Death are neighbours nigh. (lines 26-8)</page><page sequence="14">910 Hardy and the Inanimate Moreover, in admitting himself to be "no answerer," that is, as powerless and ignorant as "things around," the speaker im- plies that he too may be counted among the "chastened children sitting silent in a school." As a person, he has become a constitu- ent of the very figure he uses to personify the objects. The an- thropomorphizing power of the figure is increased by this addition, and the speaker himself is now in part a figurative verbal con- struct. Thus the possibility arises that the humanity of the speaker, like that of the objects, is itself tropological, a prosopopoeia. In fact, to the extent that the personification of the objects is intertwined with the mode of the speaker's existence, his personality is both a figure for what he figuratively perceives and an effect of his own act of figuration. The point here is that while the speaker uses the trope of prosopopoeia both to describe the objects and to permit them to speak, this process is further complicated by the fact that the speaker is also involved in it, addressed by and through the objects. This "mutual personifica- tion" of the speaker and the objects creates an inseparable con- nection between them, and makes "Nature's Questioning" not an example of simple personification, but of the personification of personification. This suggests that for Hardy, prosopopoeia is not only an essential poetic device but also a basis for characterization in fiction. To put it another way, "Nature's Questioning" examines characterization as a type of personification. In doing so, the poem reminds us that all characters, however real they may seem, have no ontological ground. The characters in Hardy's The Return of the Native resemble the speaker in "Nature's Questioning" in that they cannot be dissociated from the personification of nature. The scene in which Eustacia Vye is described as being a part of Egdon Heath illustrates this: The form was so much like an organic part of the en- tire motionless structure that to see it move would have impressed the mind as a strange phenomenon. Immobil- ity being the chief characteristic of that whole which the person formed portion of, the discontinuance of immobil- ity in any quarter suggested confusion. Yet that is what happened. The figure perceptibly gave up its fixity, shifted a step or two, and turned round. As if alarmed, it descended on the right side of the barrow, with the glide of a waterdrop down a bud, and then van- ished. The movement had been sufficient to show more</page><page sequence="15">Satoshi Nishimura 911 clearly the characteristics of the figure, and that it was a woman's.28 The passage implies first that the heath owes its personification in part to the character of Eustacia, and second that a fictional character is something "immobile" made mobile, an entity brought into existence rather than pulled from it. For Hardy, character- ization is completed personification, the trope of prosopopoeia taken literally. To the extent that in Hardy's world, both objects and characters are reliant upon personification for their very ex- istence, the act of writing consists for him not in representing an existing reality with language, but in using language as the me- dium through which to call a reality into being.
