<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kant's Philosophy of Religion D. M. MAcKINNON It was in I792 that Kant published the first Book of his most important single work on the philosophy of religion-Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone. But it was his very interesting treatment of the biblical material in the second Book that involved the philosopher in his one serious conflict with official authority. Greene and Hudson give a good account of this conflict and its effect on the work as a whole in the introduction to their translation of Religion in the Harper Torchbook Series (i96o).1 The work appeared eleven years after the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, and it is the last of Kant's major writings. Thus it takes for granted certain fundamental tracts of the philosopher's sustained argu- ment, for instance the deeply critical evaluation of the transcendent meta- physical impulse, formulated in the Dialectic of the first Critique, and significantly developed in the extended treatment of such topics as the complementarity of mechanical and teleological explanation in the Critique of Judgment, the so-called 'primacy of practical reason' and the related doctrines of the unconditional authority of the moral law and the autonomy of the rational human subject. The student of Kant's theory of knowledge, and criticism of metaphysics, and the student of his ethical and political theory, both alike find in his work on religion a great deal that is con- tinuous with arguments with which they are familiar, and that throws new light on the substance of Kant's principles by revealing their implications when they are applied to the task of the critical evaluation of religious practices and credenda. But there is more to be said. Three years after the publication of the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant published an opusculum in which he attempted to answer the question: What is Aufklirung? It was indeed within the tradition of the Aufkldrung that he stood, and he wrote as one convinced that the moral obliquity involved in the torture, imprisonment, and deprivation of civil rights of a religious antagonist, who found himself or herself con- scientiously unable to subscribe to one or other of a number of competing systems of credenda, possessed or should possess a quite unmistakably greater evidence than any of the credenda in question. By invocation of such methods, those who had recourse to them mutilated their own moral dignity as well as that of their victims. If Hume depreciated the 'monkish virtues', Kant was sharply alert to the sort of unacknowledged self-regard 1 All page references in this article are to this translation: likewise all quotations are from it. Philosophy 50 1975 13I</page><page sequence="2">D. M. MacKinnon that lurked beneath the intellectual rigour and ascetic austerity of the inquisitor. So we find him before 1792, committed, as it were, in advance to a particular sort of reductionist approach to the problems of the philo- sophy of religion. It is not one in which religious and theological concep- tions are eliminatively defined in ethical terms: rather Kant sought to bring the world of religion under that of ethics. In Religion itself we find such impulses strongly at work in the treatment of grace and prayer. But it is not the whole story. Even if we do no more than attend to the contro- versial introductory section of Religion, which treats of 'radical evil', we cannot fail to recognize that it is in this section of a work that is concerned with the critical analysis of specifically religious credenda, that Kant makes quite explicit the deep moral pessimism, of which students of the Grundle- gung are continually vaguely aware, and which is also reflected in the openly avowed Hobbism of the essay On Perpetual Peace. It is deeply significant that it is in his major work on Religion that Kant shows himself so uncompromisingly antagonistic to the facile, perfectibilian aspirations discernible in some (though not in all) writers usually claimed to belong to the Enlightenment. And as we shall see in other respects too Kant's philosophy of religion is very far from reductionist. In this article I want to discuss three questions: (a) the treatment of the relation of religion and ethics in Kant's philosophy; (b) the significance of certain individual passages both for Kant's philosophy as a whole and for the philosophy of religion and the philosophy of theology, and (c) the bearing of Kant's philosophy of religion on his criticism of transcendent metaphysics and the distinction, so mercilessly criticized by Professor Strawson, between phenomena and 'things in themselves. (a) In his work On Religion, Kant is concerned primarily with religion as a separable aspect of human life. He treats it as, in fact, the name of a family of practices including here a number of beliefs, but beliefs regarded essentially as subordinate to the practices which they both inculcate and/or sustain. For him religion has an extractible form; although, writing when and where he did, he inevitably treated most extensively of Christianity, he is drastically criticized by Hegel for his failure to attend closely enough to the particularities of individual religious traditions, including here the historical circumstances in which they were born, developed and took the determinate shapes that they did. Kant is almost entirely innocent in this section of his work of any historical sense. I say almost entirely, remember- ing that in his essay On Perpetual Peace ideas are in play which are also important in his specific treatment of religion. It is often said that his attitude towards prayer shows that Kant was deeply insensitive to characteristically religious impulses. In his ethical writing he so stresses human autonomy that he finds in the attitude of the devout, who seems to seek from the hand of God what he should achieve for himself, something destructive of the very substance of moral life. If 132</page><page sequence="3">Kant's Philosophy of Religion men are moral agents, what they do must be their own; his style is Stoic and he offends even those who altogether reject the claims of religion, by his seeming indifference alike to humility, to tenderness and to weakness. I say seeming indifference because here, as always, one quickly becomes aware that Kant tries to do justice to what at a first reading he seems to dismiss out of hand. He writes admittedly as a philosopher with a clear vision of the moral life and his own personal sense of the priorities within it. Further, although he is indifferent to historical relativity, he is himself (as I have said) a man of the age in which he wrote and his work on religion is only intelligible if these facts are remembered. Where the moral life is concerned, it is notorious that Kant is unwilling under any circumstances to consider a lie justified, even if the extremity of the situation in which the lie is told might be thought casuistically to make of words spoken a kind of performance designed, for instance, to protect a friend from the secret police rather than a misrepresentation of fact. One could speak in such a case of a verbal feat carried out in full awareness that one was conveying false information concerning one's friend's whereabouts, a feat executed in full awareness of what one is doing. It seems moral pedantry on Kant's part to fail to distinguish (as Plato does) such an action from one in which one's deceit involves, however slightly, the kind of self- deception which Kant would seem to have feared as inevitably destructive of the sort of relationship he supposed human beings must try to establish with themselves and with their fellows. If a man deliberately hides what he is actively about not only from his fellows but in a measure from himself (and it is his view that the liar must do this), he puts the 'realm of ends' in peril, and of this 'realm' he is himself as much a member as the man or woman to whom he tells an untruth.2 We must, as far as is possible, learn what we are about when we act. If Kant notoriously insists that the moral worth of an action depends upon the motive from which it is done and sometimes seems to identify this motive with respect for a moral law to be identified with the achievement of a mere formal consistency of maxim, in other places (even in the Grundlegung) he clothes this consistency with flesh and blood, at least delineating the kind of order he supposes we achieve by a relentless refusal to allow any purposes, whether individual or collective, to distract us from submission to the sovereign authority of the 'realm of ends'. Sometimes Kant is betrayed by his argument into writing as if the whole of morality consisted in our being honest with ourselves and as if immorality was found in any action that deterred us, or threatened to deflect us, from submission to the rigorous dictates of such a policy of life. Yet, if he moves in such a direction he does so because he is aware that men are often deceived into supposing that they cease to be self-regarding by subordinating their private individual purposes to a collective. Thus the 2 Cf. Butler's sermon on Self-Deception. I33</page><page sequence="4">D. M. MacKinnon soldier, obeying the dictates of an allegedly superior authority to serve in the forces of his country in an unjust war, or persuaded by patriotic sentiment to remain silent when the methods by which a war just in the circumstances of its inception is prosecuted, become destructive of the ends it has been initiated to achieve, cannot obviously be accused of self- regard. But the cause he is serving is one expressive of an uncriticized collective self-seeking that would seem to silence individual protest against its procedures in the name of the moral order by regarding its actions as themselves creative of the only system of imperatives an agent needs, in the special circumstances indicated, to guide his conduct aright. When Kant wrote on the relation of religion and ethics, he wrote (as I said above) as a man who was vividly aware of the extent to which religious authorities, claiming to declare the ways of God to men, were wont to identify obedience to their reading of the alleged divine purpose or purposes with ultimate human good. In particular they had shown themselves as a matter of historical fact totally unwilling to exercise any sort of restraint upon the methods which they employed to enforce conformity with their doctrine and tradition. Granted that they acted in the conviction that the matters on which they claimed to speak were of crucial import, they allowed this conviction to betray them (as I said above) into the worst conceivable violations of human integrity. In doing this, they showed themselves oblivious of the collective self-interest which, unknown to them, shaped their actions. When Acton remarked that 'all power tends to corrupt, absolute power corrupts absolutely', he wrote as one who had clearly learnt a moral lesson that Kant certainly believed to be of the greatest importance. To understand Kant's ethics, and especially his view of the relations of ethics to religion, it is most important to realize that he develops his often curiously elusive ethical ideas in part at least as a protest against the morally destructive effects wrought on human life by competing religious authori- tarianisms. It is not that he regarded the questions on which devoutly religious men and women differed one from another as trivial or even as impossible of settlement. It is rather (to repeat myself again) that he supposed the moral outrage committed by any attempt to impose one set of beliefs against another as more evident than any of the competing systems. He has indeed a good deal to say that is sometimes very interesting on various technical theological issues; but he says it in the context of a clear conviction that moral principles are sovereign and that if any form of religion is to be acknowledged valid, it can only be one that does not dispute this sovereignty. Yet, Kant does not go on from there simply to evaluate religious credenda as so many aids to living well. It is a pity that some of those who write on his so-called 'moral argument for the existence of God' do not pay more attention to his writing on religion. It is clear from the argument of the Dialectic in the first Critique that he did not regard the kinds of proposition '34</page><page sequence="5">Kant's Philosophy of Religion we might suppose the yield of such an argument as intelligible. Similarly, where immortality is concerned, the conclusions he claims to have reached in the Paralogisms of Rational Psychology remain; we can attach no sense to what we may say concerning a surviving substantial soul. Where Kant speaks of the immortality of the soul as a 'postulate of pure practical reason', by doing so he makes of immortality matter primarily of rational religious hope. It is, moreover, a hope that he supposes justified by the fact that only if we entertain the idea of a state in which frustrations to the completion of the individual's moral commitment are made good, are we confirmed in the commitment in question. We must not forget here the impact upon the intellectual world to which Kant belonged of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. It was not only the crude metaphysics of those who argued this to be the 'best of all possible worlds' that received a heavy blow from this disaster. The circumstances in which men and women met their deaths reminded such a philosopher as Kant that if indeed 'ought implies can', he must reckon with the seeming total indifference of the environment in which men and women lived towards the sort of moral self-discipline, the sort of strenuous struggling after honesty, on which he laid such empha- sis. Questions were raised concerning the relation of the 'realm of nature' to the 'realm of ends' to which theoretical answers were already ruled out as inconceivable. But men and women were creatures of flesh and blood, and if they were to pursue the good life, especially as Kant conceived it, they must have some sort of assurance that their labour was not in vain. Of course, in order not to misconceive such assurance, they must first find themselves convinced of the sovereign authority of the moral order. In other words, they must receive the categorical imperative as categorical. It may be that Kant here advances into sheer self-contradiction. If he can be thought to escape such a charge, we must try to integrate what he is emphasizing in the passages in his writings at present in my mind with the central problem left by the Critique of Pure Reason of the relation of phenomena to 'things in themselves' with which I shall be concerned in the last part of this paper. For the time being, I would emphasize that for all his explicitly affirmed hostility to the life of prayer, it is as an eschatologi- cal hope entertained in the practice of religion subordinated to morality that we dare to speak of immortality. But what can we say of such entertainment? Where the hope of immortality is concerned, Kant is primarily (in my view) moved by consideration of the natural evils (Cbel) that menace moral practice, including (one might add) circumstances of inheritance and early environment for which children cannot conceivably be held respon- sible (it is indeed at this point that we touch the frontiers between libel and Bose (moral evil)). If Kant was blind where prayer was concerned, he did his utmost to make sense of grace. A recent French writer (M. Bruch)3 3 In his book La Philosophie Religieuse de Kant (Aubier, 1970). I35</page><page sequence="6">D. M. MacKinnon has indeed suggested (on Kant's philosophy of religion) that the tag of the Jesuit theologians, Facienti quod in se est, non denegat Deus gratiam, goes a long way to express concisely Kant's understanding of the way in which alleged divine grace co-operates with human freedom. There must be found in the agent a kind of prior responsiveness to the divine perfection and transformation of his or her action. Again, there is a frankly Stoic emphasis on individual effort; it is indeed this note of strenuous moral endeavour that is found deeply uncongenial by many readers of Kant's ethics. This, though the unexpected emphasis on what he calls 'radical evil' in Religion goes some way to lay bare the pessimism out of which some of the characteristic emphases of his moral philosophy sprang. While em- phasizing in his philosophy of religion the subordination of religion to morality to the extent of insisting that characteristically religious concep- tions find their sense in a moral context, he is yet equally emphatic that where some of these conceptions (for instance, even that of divine grace) are concerned, they have a context that cannot be exhaustively cashed in moral terms. But what is this content? Can we attach any sense to it? Here Kant seems to require at the same time to invoke the sort of metaphysical agnosticism he claimed to establish by his distinction of phenomena from things in themselves and an almost indulgent readiness to use conventional religious language, as if the combination of his agnosticism with his moralism would protect men and women against misunderstanding what they were about in using it. To make my meaning clearer I venture to quote a prayer: 0 God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, who by a voice from heaven didst proclaim, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, multiply, we beseech thee, to those who rest in Jesus, the unsearchable blessings of thy love, that the good work which thou didst begin in them may be perfected unto the day of Jesus Christ (Scottish Book of Common Prayer, I929). I am not for one moment suggesting that Kant would have approved the religious sentiments expressed in that prayer. A very great deal that he says on the subject of human autonomy is incompatible with the implied confession of the divine origination of the good that allegedly has been done by those on whose behalf the prayer is offered. Yet consider the following passage: That is, he can hope in the light of that purity of the principle which he has adopted as the supreme maxim of his will, and of its stability, to find himself upon the good (though strait) path of continual progress from bad to better. For Him who penetrates to the intelligible ground of the heart (the ground of all maxims of the will) and for whom this unending progress is a unity, i.e. for God, this amounts to his being i36</page><page sequence="7">Kant's Philosophy of Religion actually a good man (pleasing to Him); and, thus viewed, this change can be regarded as a revolution. But in the judgment of men, who can appraise themselves and the strength of their maxims only by the ascendancy which they win over their sensuous nature in time, this change must be regarded as nothing but an ever-enduring struggle towards the better, hence as a gradual reformation of the propensity to evil, the perverted cast of mind.4 In the layout of Religion this passage occurs after the sombre introductory exposition of 'the radical evil in human nature'. The account which Kant gives of the origin of this tendency (if he allows that any account can be given at all, in terms intelligible to us) is very obscure (p. 38). In the passage quoted, however, he is clearly insisting that where human appreciation of the moral life is concerned, any overcoming of this evil tendency, whether in oneself or another, must be represented as a temporal progress. Yet mindful presumably of his arguments in the Critique of Pure Reason aimed at showing both that time is genetically a subjective form of intuition, and at the same time the all-embracing context both of our experience and of the world with which in that experience we have to do, he suggests that we cannot conceive how such a progress may be viewed from the divine standpoint. Yet where we are concerned, it is of moral progress that we must speak. In his actual remarks on the subject of immortality in Religion (p. 149) which include a very curious discussion of the 'parable of the unjust steward' and a characteristically Kantian comment on that of the 'sheep and the goats', he speaks in terms of reward; yet in the concluding sentence (p. I50) he adds significantly and it became evident that when the Teacher of the Gospel spoke of rewards in the world to come he wished to make them thereby not an incentive to action but merely (as a soul-elevating representation of the consummation of the divine benevolence and wisdom in the guidance of the human race) an object of the purest respect and of the greatest moral approval when reason reviews human destiny in its entirety. Here for the emphasis on reward something much subtler is substituted, something that coheres with the treatment of grace to which reference has been made earlier in the paper. (b) In comparison with the three Critiques, Religion is a comparatively short work; but it is one of considerable complexity in which the author shows a refreshing readiness to modify in his detailed discussions of religion and theological concepts the general principles of his philosophy of religion. The deep pessimism of his doctrine of 'radical evil' with which the work begins is perhaps its best known contribution to his moral philosophy. In 4 Greene and Hudson, p. 43. I37</page><page sequence="8">D. M. MacKinnon this section it emerges quite clearly that for Kant God is less the creator than the ultimate judge. Thus on p. 66 we read The extent of his guilt is due not so much to the infinitude of the Supreme Lawgiver whose authority is thereby violated (for we under- stand nothing of such transcendent relationships of man to the Supreme Being) as to the fact that this moral evil lies in the disposition and the maxims in general, in universal basic principles rather than in particular transgression. (The case is different before a human court of justice, for such a court attends merely to single offences and therefore to the deed itself and what is relative thereto, and not to the general disposition.) Nothing is said concerning the manner of this ultimate judge's knowledge of the 'general disposition' of which Kant speaks. It is in the Critique of Judgment, in the section in which he discriminates between an intuitive and a discursive understanding,5 that Kant makes his contribution to the analysis of the metaphysical concept of omniscience. Where human understanding involves the use, the refinement, the distinction, the integra- tion of concepts understood as recognitional capacities, in the case of an intuitive understanding, which Kant represents as creating its own objects, those objects are immediately transparent to it. Where such an under- standing is concerned, no question arises concerning the identification of an unknown particular, the suitability of this concept or that to this or that situation. Such an understanding never needs to ask what a thing is; it has no need to infer, to question, to guess, to put its view of the particular situation to the test. In human life we are often puzzled by the motives and intentions of those with whom we live; our own behaviour is frequently very far from transparent to us, and we are surprised when we are made to recognize, for instance, that our supposed disinterested kindness was an elaborate essay in unacknowledged self-regard, in which, partly unknown to ourselves, we sought to cut a figure with our fellows. But where an intuitive understanding is concerned, we have to reckon with an under- standing that is set free from the sorts of built-in limitations that Kant supposes characteristic of such an understanding as our own. In the Critique of Judgment he is not arguing that there is in fact such an under- standing; he invokes the concept of its activity to complete the account of the role of conceptual thinking in human knowledge which he had begun in the Metaphysical Deduction of the categories in his first Critique. But in interpreting this passage in Religion concerning the 'Supreme Lawgiver', we are perhaps justified in illuminating Kant's meaning by reference to this very interesting passage in the Critique of Judgment. Yet in Religion the extreme pessimism of its introduction prefaces his 5 Bernard's translation, p. 319 ff. 138</page><page sequence="9">Kant's Philosophy of Religion extended treatment of the traditional Christian theology of redemption by Christ. In these sections of the work one is made aware of Kant's familiarity with the commonplaces of theological argument, especially in the Lutheran tradition with which he was naturally most immediately familiar. Inevitably the argument focuses on the work of Christ and its significance for what Kant describes as the 'conflict of the Good and the Evil principle'. Any suggestion of substitutionary atonement is necessarily alien to his insistence on human autonomy. Yet he seeks to give to Christ's work a significance which goes far beyond that of a classic example of innocent suffering, borne with an exemplary heroism and an altogether undiminished compassion for his fellows, including the agents of his torment. The contradiction in his position is well illustrated by the following long quotation: Yet the good principle has descended in mysterious fashion from heaven into humanity not at one particular time alone but from the first begin- nings of the human race (as anyone must grant who considers the holiness of this principle, and the incomprehensibility of a union between it and man's sensible nature in the moral predisposition) and it rightfully has in mankind its first dwelling place. And since it made its appearance in an actual human being, as an example to all others [it may be said that] 'he came unto his own, and his own received him not, but as many as received him, to them gave he power to be called the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name'. That is, by example (in and through the moral idea) he opens the portals of freedom to all who, like him, choose to become dead to everything that holds them fettered to life on earth to the detriment of morality; and he gathers together, among them, 'a people for his possession, zealous of good works' and under his sovereignty, while he abandons to their fate all those who prefer moral servitude. So the moral outcome of the combat, as regards the hero of this story (up to the time of his death), is really not the conquering of the evil principle-for its kingdom still endures, and certainly a new epoch must arrive before it is overthrown-but merely the breaking of its power to hold, against their will, those who have so long been its subjects, because another dominion (for man must be subject to some rule or other), a moral dominion, is now offered them as an asylum where they can find protection for their morality if they wish to forsake the former sovereignty. Furthermore, the evil principle is still designated the prince of this world, where those who adhere to the good principle should always be prepared for physical sufferings, sacrifices, and mortifications of self-love-[tribulations] to be viewed, in this connection, as persecu- tions by the evil principle, since the latter has rewards in his kingdom only for those who have made earthly well-being their final goal (pp. 77-78). '39</page><page sequence="10">D. M. MacKinnon He goes on to speak of the need of 'divesting' this 'mode of presentation' of its 'mystical veil' in order that its rational sense may be made binding for the whole world. He identifies this sense with the recognition that only the sincerest adoption of genuinely moral principles into their disposition can achieve salvation for men. It is not so much their sensuous nature which works against this adoption as a 'certain self-incurred perversity' which he goes on characteristically to call 'falsity'. He is extremely guarded in what he says concerning Christ's work. Much of his argument inclines him to treat the story of Jesus' ministry and death as a supremely educative illustration of what is possible in spite of the pervasiveness of self-regard and self-deceit in human action. Yet when he speaks, for instance, of 'a moral dominion. . offered (to men) as an asylum where they can find protection for their morality if they wish to forsake the former sovereignty', he seems to go some way beyond this position, as if the coming of Christ were itself a proleptic vindication of the good man's hope that his stubborn, if often interrupted, effort to purify his motives, to deepen his self- knowledge and free himself in the respect of the springs of his action from deep self-deception, is not doomed to frustration. Kant seems to come very near one of the deepest theological insights of the fourth Gospel, namely that Jesus in his rejection, presented by Pilate as one who in his purple robe and crowned with thorns is too ridiculous for men even to bother to compass his destruction, is the ultimate judge of all the world, and that by that judgment, carried out in a setting in which he is identified with those he arraigns, the world is purified. The passage with which we have just been concerned is followed by a section on miracle, in which Kant devotes some space to criticizing the tradition of allegedly demonic miracles. What he says is closely bound up with his treatment of grace. But he also (p. 8I) makes use of his meta- physical agnosticism, seeming to imply that a confident employment of the concept of the miraculous involves a totally invalid supposition that the ways of the divine ordering of the world are open to us; whereas they cannot be regarded even as conceivable. (c) On p. 59 there is a long footnote: At this point let me remark incidentally that while, in the ascent from the sensible to the supersensible, it is indeed allowable to schematize (that is, to render a concept intelligible by the help of an analogy to something sensible), it is on no account permitted us to infer (and thus to extend our concept), by this analogy, that what holds of the former must also be attributed to the latter. Such an inference is impossible, for the simple reason that it would run directly counter to all analogy to conclude that, because we absolutely need a schema to render a concept intelligible to ourselves (to support it with an example), it therefore follows that this schema must necessarily belong to the object itself as its predicate. Thus, 140</page><page sequence="11">Kant's Philosophy of Religion I cannot say: I can make comprehensible to myself the cause of a plant (or of any organic creature, or indeed of the whole purposive world) only by attributing intelligence to it, on the analogy of an artificer in his relation to his work (say a watch); therefore the cause (of the plant and of the world in general) must itself possess intelligence. That is, I cannot say that this postulated intelligence of the cause conditions not merely my comprehending it but also conditions the possibility of its being a cause. On the contrary, between the relation of a schema to its concept and the relation of this same schema of a concept to the objective fact itself there is no analogy, but rather a mighty chasm, the overleaping of which (metabasis eis allo genos) leads at once to anthropomorphism. The proof of this I have given elsewhere. Kant insists that what he called schematization on no account allows us to suppose ourselves warranted by the analogy we have invoked in finding correspondence in the supersensible to the sensible. He refers to the principles he has established in the Critique of Judgment on the use of teleological explanation in biology, where we are entitled to suppose plants in their growth answering to the concept of a pre-formed purpose provided that we recognize the supposition of such an integrating design to be no more than an 'as if' which allows us to treat the plant as a whole. What he says in this passage in the Religion shows how deeply he held to the meta- physical agnosticism he had established in his first Critique. We must (p. 58) in religion speak of God's love towards the world and we must represent this love in terms of sacrificial self-giving. To suppose that an all-sufficient being could sacrifice a part of what belongs to his state of bliss or rob himself of a possession is to entertain a nonsense. But it is the kind of nonsense which we may safely indulge in once we have resolutely made our own the inescapable limitation of any sort of analogical represen- tation. By such representation we convey to ourselves nothing whatsoever con- cerning the ultimate, which for Kant can never be the subject matter of referential or descriptive statement. It is, however, more than an exercise in make-believe; for behind phenomena there lie 'things in themselves', of which indeed we are able to say nothing, but which, by our hardly admissible recognition of their reality, compel us again to recognize that which lies Deyond the reach of our experience, of which, indeed, if we speak at all, we must speak in an idiom that only recognition both of its sheerly analogical character, and of the essentially unknown structure of that to which it points, authorizes us to use. It is with the tradition of 'negative theology', that in the end Kant, who can neither accept a religious faith that pre- supposes a divine self-revelation nor completely subordinate the entertain- ment of its possibility to morality as an instrument that serves the effective extension of the latter's authority, comes to rest. It is indeed his doctrine '4I</page><page sequence="12">D. M. MacKinnon of the limitations of human experience that provides the background to his vindication of moral freedom, and it is to the same sustained argument that he returns in his tentative attempt to answer the questions relating to the status of religious credenda. In his later writings Kant makes bold and sometimes extremely effective use of analogies. Thus in the Tugendlehre Section 24 (Darmstadt edition, I971, p. 28S) he writes: Wenn von Pflichtgesetzen (nicht von Naturgesetzen) die Rede ist und zwar im ausseren Verhaltnis der Menschen gegen einander, so betrachten wir uns in einer moralischen (intelligibelen) Welt, in welcher, nach der Analogie mit der physischen, die Verbindunt verniinftiger Wesen (auf Erden) durch Anziehung und Abstossung bewirkt wird. Vermoge des Prinzips der Wechselliebe sind sie angewiesen, sich einander bestandig zu nahern, durch das der Achtung, die sie einander schuldig sind, sich im Abstande von einander zu erhalten, und, sollte eine dieser grossen sittlichen/Krafte sinken: ,'so wiirde dann das Nichts (der Immoralitat) mit aufgesperrtem Schlund der (moralischen) Wesen ganzes Reich, wie einen Tropfen Wasser trinken' (wenn ich mich hier der Worte Hallers, nur in einer andern Beziehung, bedienen darf). Here Kant uses the complementary attractive and repulsive action of force in a Newtonian gravitational field as an analogue of the way in which in human love, those who love one another must avoid in order to preserve the authenticity of their mutual affection, the attempt either to achieve domination over the beloved, or so to be sucked into the beloved's orbit that affection degenerates into an infatuation as destructive to the one who is the object of infatuation as it is to the one who is infatuated. Yet no one reading this passage in Kant's last considerable work on ethics supposes that he thinks his readers will believe that there is any ontologically grounded community between analogatum and analogate. But in the passage in Religion with which we are concerned, the matter is different. There Kant issues his warning against the transformation of a schematism of analogy (one might say, mere analogy) into a schematism of objective determination (p. S8), partly because he is fully aware that the strange idiom of a divine self-giving has been employed in respect of a particular human life which Kant clearly believed had been lived, and lived in such a way as to invite this sort of commentary, in which by sheer anthropomorphism, the sort of language regarded as appropriate in characterization of the way in which that life was lived (complete spon- taneous self-disregard, a readiness to sacrifice all consideration of vindica- tion at the bar of informed contemporary opinion to accessibility to human need and to the claims upon him of the Ultimate to whom alone he regarded himself as accountable; one should recall the importance in the argument of the Grundlegung of Kant's comment on the question of Jesus: Why I42</page><page sequence="13">Kant's Philosophy of Religion callest thou me good?) is extrapolated to represent the secret of its origin. It belongs to the religious life, as Kant conceives it, that its orientation in the Christian tradition upon the career of an historical individual (in- cluding his relentless self-discipline in respect of the springs of his action) encourages a peculiar indulgence in anthropomorphism, as necessary to the proper religious engagement with the realities of moral evil as it is intellectually perilous. The prophylactic against the destructive consequences of such indul- gence is to be found in the paradoxical insistence of the Critique of Pure Reason that while we may confidently affirm the necessity of certain structural constants in the world around us, we do so only in respect of a world that is, where its pervasive forms are concerned, conformed to the conditions of our experiencing. Others than Professor Strawson have spoken of Kant's anthropocentrism; but unlike him, they have seen that his distinction between phenomena and 'things-in-themselves' (as well as continuing to a new level of sophistication Locke's distinction between nominal and real essences, so rightly commended by Professor Bennett in his recent book-Locke, Berkeley, Hume6) provides him with the means of acknowledging that which it lies beyond our intellectual capacity to repre- sent and with the method at once of measuring up to its intractability, while becoming acclimatized to the peculiar role of the idiom by which we seek to indicate it. It is here that part of the significance of Kant's Religion is to be found. There is much in it to which I have not referred; for instance, the lengthy treatment of the relation between religion and clericalism, which while reminding the reader of Kant's sympathy with the temper of the Auf- klarung, shows a remarkable degree of insight into the peculiar moral problems confronting the religious devotee, impelled by sense of obligation to override the obstacles that seem to him to stand in the way of his would- be convert's adherence to what he regards as supremely precious. In this section Kant's insistence on the subordination of religion to morality is inevitably emphasized; but the mood of the work is still set by the emphasis of its opening on 'radical evil' (for Kant an inexplicable reality that must be accepted), and the student of Kant's philosophy will find in it (in a way significantly different from that of the Metaphysik der Ethik), whether or not he is interested in its tortuous but extremely interesting treatment of the problems of religious belief, a very significant complement to the self- conscious formalism of the Grundlegung, and a continuance of the philoso- pher's enquiry into the significance of statement concerning the transcen- dent both tantalizing and suggestive. For the student of the philosophy of 6 Jonathan Bennett, Locke, Berkeley, Hume (pp. i2o if.). It will be realized that I go beyond what Professor Bennett suggests in finding an analogue with Kant's distinction, and indeed in what a strict interpretation of Locke may enjoin.
