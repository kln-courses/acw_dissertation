<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE 4 KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAVÁTI-STÜPA by GUNAPALA SENADEERA The story of the Mirisavâtiya construction relates how King Dutthagâmini had gone to Tisâ-vàva in a procession with the Kunta at its head for the festival of water-sports to mark the con clusion of victory celebrations and, on his way to have had the kunta installed on the spot where the present Mirisvátiya stands.1 On his way to return to the city after the water-sports his men are reported to have been unable to remove the kunta from the spot where it was planted whereupon he decided to erect the present stupa by enclosing it. This story indicates the ancient ^practice of adopting the kunta as a royal standard—a sort of a mace in Shri Lanka in its state functions as well as on ceremonial occasions. There are many references in our classical literature to royal pro cessions at the head of which a kunta, konta2 or jaya-konta3 was carried as a standard of high esteem. What is this kunta ? What is its likeness or its pictorial form ? Why was it carried at royal processions; these are the questions that have been addressed here. At present there exists a strong tradit ion of carrying a pair of Kuntàyudhas, some times several of them, with one or several sësatas at the head of ceremonial processions. These kuntàyudhas are often called muràyudhas meaning 'guarding weapons', probably because, they are believed to be having a power of guarding the people against evils. However, the kuntàyudhas or kunta weapons are regarded as some kind of weapons or spears of a particular style. It has one central blade, pointed as a rule, flanked by two brackets each tip of which is rolled downward. Normally, there should be two such kuntàyudhas or muràyudhas with shafts crossing each other at their middle, and this pair too is flanking a sesata meaning an umbrella of a special type. Text of a lecture delivered on 20th Jan. 1992</page><page sequence="2">14 THE 'KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAVÁTI-STÜPA The important question that arises here is whether the kunta enshrined in the Mirisvátiya is to be identified with the kuntâyudha which has been described here above. As stated before, the kunta was also known as konta and jaya-konta. Konta can be identi fied with the kunta which appears to have undergone a phonetic change—a step in the process of evolution and, jaya-konta may mean a victory-konta or a 'konta of success'. This latter desig nation may have been given to it because of its association with implied well-being or success in life. Mahavamsa has an important reference relating to the period of King Silâkâla (518-531 A.C.). It says that the king set up beside the Bodhi tree in the Abhayuttara Vihara the 'throne' or the âsana called kunta which he had fetched away from the Paceena Vihara or the 'Eastern Vihara' of the Thëravâda fraternity.4 However, there is no information other than this reference, to the existence of a kunta-àsana in the premises of the Abhayuttara Vihara, viz. the present Abhayagiri Vihara. Even the excavations that are being carried out under the Cultural Triangle Project have so far not brought to light an artifact of this description. Despite this absence, we have a slab (Fig. 1) in the salapatara maluwa of the Ruvanvali-sàya that would suit the description of the Mahavamsa. At present, this slab is just another slab in the vast expanse of the Jiwpa-compound paved with stone-slabs, and millions of devotees, from about the late Anuradhapura period, have walked over it without noticing its presence, as they do even today. Nevertheless, judging from the extent of its wearing out, the slab in question could be treated as falling into the pre-Christian period of our history. The dimensions of the slab are roughly three feet in length and one and a half feet in width. It is so old that many cracks have appeared on its face which looks smoothened, probably as a result of constant rubbing over with sandalwood through a long period of time as has been the case with several other sacred slabs. Its rectangular form is suggestive of its being used as an âsana which was used to represent the Buddha during the period prior to the emergence of the Buddha-image. The most remarkable factor in this case is the engraving of a figure on its face, which is discussed later in this paper.</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, {N.S.) 1991/92 J5 The âsana reminds us of the period when the Buddha was worshipped by means of a symbol held sacred for a long period of time. Most important of them are the Bodhi Tree, the Dhamma cakka, the Pâdukâ or the Foot-prints, the Àsana or the seat, the Agnistambha or the Pillar of Fire, the Lotus, Nandipada and Vardhamâna.5 A serious study into the beliefs and religious prac tices of the people of the ancient world would prove that these objects were held as objects of worship and, therefore, were chosen to represent the Blessed One when His physical form was not desir able to be committed to an anthropomorphic figure. Thus the old slab which we see in the salapatara-maluwa could be identified as an âsana slab of a distinct type which would have been once employed as a sacred object representing the Buddha. This con jecture of ours receives support from two other factors : a. Firstly, it bears on its face a pictorial representation of the much disputed object which has been designated with a variety of names by indologists, viz. Nandipada, Triraina, Buddhist Trisula, Taurine, Buddhist Taurine, Vardhamâna. b. Secondly, it has a smooth face, in all probability, caused by rubbing over with sandalwood by the devotees for cult purposes. It has been a strong belief of the people particularly, of Shri Lanka and India, to use paste, smears or water which had contact with such sacred objects as having a medicinal efficacy. Two factors referred to above lead one to believe that this particular artifact, though it remains entirely ignored now as an insignificant slab of stone which is being trodden daily by the people, once, used to command their respect as an object of worship of a very high order. It would have been then installed in a special shrine, the likeness of which could be conceived of with the help of a sculptured representation depicted on the face of an ancient frag ment of a column discovered from Sanchi6. We are yet to identify this with the kunta stone-slab referred to in the Mahavamsa though with uncertainty. If it could be so identified then we come to the other conjecture that it was transferred to the present site from the Abhayagiri Vihara at a later date.</page><page sequence="4">16 THE 'KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAV ATI-STUPA The figure that appears on the stone-slab under reference has its parallels in many ancient Buddhist sites in India, although we have only a very few of them in Sri Lanka. Its only significant parallel to my knowledge is seen sculptured on the face of an oíd fragmented column lying amidst a heap of other similar artifacts piled up in a corner of the maluwa of the great Thupa and it is exposed to the ravages of the unkindly weather of the Dry Zone. Besides, its pictorial representations on a tiny scale, are mostly found partially visible decorating the heel of the sacred foot-prints; examples of such are scattered among the other ruins in Anuradhapura as well as in other lesser-known Buddhist sites in the Ruhuna region.7 However, its position in India is quite different. Its many parallels are found in low relief as well as in the round among the ancient remains lying in Buddhist sites such as Bharhut, Sanchi, Bodhigaya, Mathura, Kausham, Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda.8 Its most reputed representation is to be seen on the summit of the northern gate-way at Sanchi (Fig. 2).9 It looks a composite object containing in it another object within it. The main object is mounted on a stand with a three phased pedestal. The object proper rests on a floral disc occupied in full by an open lotus. What appears on the disc is an object comprising two converging brackets with tips branched off into three. The lower ends of the two brackets meet to form a cusp, the tip of which remains at a lower level. What is enclosed by the two converging brackets, is the foreign object which has provoked a controversy among the indologists on its identification. The main object here has two leaf-like formations projectihg from the two points of tangency on either side between the disc and the object mounted on it. There are many representations of this object discovered from archaeological sites in India such as Sanchi and Amarawati; some examples from Amarawati are seen in a position of supporting a dhammacakka,10 still in others, they are seen decorated with gar lands pending from their extremes.11 There are also several examples of 'foot-prints' from Shri Lanka as well as from India, decorated with auspicious symbols included in the list of astamangalas.12. The important feature in these</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S) 1991/92 17 artifacts is the eminent position accorded to the symbol in question. It is accomodated on the heel of the sole, just below the wheel symbol and, compared with other symbols it appears larger in size, which factor alone would account for its importance among the auspicious symbols. As seen earlier, it was also one of the several auspicious symbols employed to represent the Buddha, prior to the emergence of the Buddha-image. One of several examples to be cited in this regard is the relief from Bharhut showing Visvabhu Buddha in the form of the object under discussion occuypying the Vajrâsana at the foot of His Sala Bodhi.13 Then, there is another which is from Sanchi showing 'Sakya-Muni-Bhagawa\ i.e. Gotama Buddha, occupying the Vajrasana set up at the foot of the Asvattha Bodhi.14 As stated before, oriental scholars are at great variance with each other, with regard to the designations they apply to this ob ject. Both Col. Alexander Cunningham and Lt. Col. Maisey being the distinguished archaeologists responsible for the excava tions at Sanchi, during the latter part of the last century, prefer to call it Triratna,13 as they believed that it symbolizes the Buddhist Triad, viz. Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Sir John Marshall, Foucher, Benjamin Rowland and Heinrich Zimmer, all eminent archaeologists, referred to it as Taurine.16 Meanwhile, Eugine Burnouff identified it with VardhamanaP Ananda Coomaras wamy called it Trisula in Buddhism18 and adds that the designation Taurine employed by some European archaeologists is the best designation suitable to name the symbol. The reason for the use of the designation Triratna which is now being popularly used to name the symbol was explained earlier. However, other scholars have expressed the view that there are no three prongs to be seen in this object. The middle prong, if at all one could call so, is a mere cusp formed by the meeting of the two converging brackets of the object. Besides, in some examples, as in the one engraved on the âsana also laid in the sala-patara-maluwa of the Ruvanvâli-saya, this particular member differs in form entirely from the two flanking arms of the same object and it rises above the level of the tips of the latter. In some other examples, as in the one on the summit of the northern gateway at Sanchi, this member</page><page sequence="6">18 THE 'KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAV ÂTI-STUPA remains lower in height than that of its two flankers. This in congruity in height of the middle member of the object makes it difficult for one to assign a place in the Buddhist Triad or the Triple-Gem which has a uniform rank for all of its three members. Of the two other designations, Nandipada is applied to this object because of the similarity in form that it bears with a symbolic representation, identified with Nandipada, to be seen on the peak of Padana hill near Bombay. However, Ananda Coomaraswamy had already expressed his doubts as to whether this designation, which means the foot-print of Nandi bull, the vehicle of Shiva, could be applied to this work of art. The reason for this, as he explains, is the presence of some hoof marks engraved beside the symbol. However, Coomaraswamy is in favour of the designation, Taurine, suggested by European archaeologists and he prefers the same to his own suggestion, viz. Buddhist Trisula.19 In western terminology the zodiacal sign pictorially represented by the forequarters of a bull is known as Taurine or, as is known elsewhere, Taurus. This constellation presents a combination of two clusters of stars named Pleiades and Hyades respectively.20 In astronomy it is represented by a bull-head with Hyades that takes the V shape or lower half of a circle surmounting Pleiades of a somewhat circular shape. The constellation of Taurine or Taurus plays an important part in the calendar of the primitive people living in both hemispheres.21 They treat this constellation as a giver of rain which brings life and prosperity to them, and they celebrate its appearance in the firmament. It thus shows its con nection with the cult known to the West as the 'fertility cult' popu larly practised by the ancient civilizations of the world. Shri Lanka does not appear to be an exception, as is proved by its adoption, though in a crude form, in two inscriptions. The in scription discovered from Bowattegala commences with the figure of a Taurine quadruple in place of either swastika symbol or the abbreviation sidha meaning 'Hail' adopted by most of the other inscriptions.22 Meanwhile, T. B. Karunaratne who is an eminent researcher in the field of Buddhist symbols has contributed several learned</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S) 1991/92 19 articles on the subject. He identifies the object under discussion with satti occuring in the list of auspicious marks associated with the wheel symbol on the sole of the Buddha.23 Herein, it is surprising to observe that the Dharmapradipi kâwa,24 Butsarana25 and Püjávaliya,26 all Sinhala literary works believed to have been written during a period of two centuries falling between the 13th and the 14th century, completely omit the item satti, not to speak of using to head it, in the list of auspicious marks. This is, despite the fact that the works referred to are believed to have borrowed their lists from Jinâlankâra Tika as wel as from the Anâgatawamsa Atthakathâ both of which have used the word in their list. On the other hand, they all adopt swastika in place of the for mer, probably due to the fact that satti was not known in the con temporary society either here or in the sub-continent as a member of the mangala-lakkhanas of the paduka of the Buddha. Even though they were quite acquainted with the term satti, they knew it as an 'âvudha-satti\27 i.e. 'the satti which is the weapon' meaning a mere spear and not any thing synonymous with the kunta by which name the particular symbol under discussion appears to have been known in this country. This appears to have been the attitude adopted by the authors of other similar texts too such as the Jinal amkâravannana„zsSamantakutuvannanà29 and the Pajjamadhu.30 The suggestion of Mr. Karunaratne that the authors of the works referred to above may have confused satti with sotthi or sovatthika31 does not appear to receive reasonable support for the simple reason that it is difficult to believe that they were ignorant of the meaning and implications of a popular word such as satti. It is possible to presume that the kunta of the earlier period began to be considered identical with sirivaccha (Srivatas) at later times. The appearance of the term satti in the list of mangala-lakk hanas even in the canonical texts such as Sumangala-vilâsini32 and Papancasudani3 is subject to variant readings in the particular context. Some recensions of these two texts provide the item as satti while others adopt sotthi meaning (Skt) swastika to head the list.</page><page sequence="8">20 THE 'KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAV ÂTI-STUPA If satti is to be equated with sakti in Sanskrit to mean a wea pon, one needs to cite at least one instance where it is applied to mean any weapon-object other than the spear, lance, dart or dag er.34 Another meaning applied to sakti in Sanskrit is as ratha sakti meaning the staff which supports the banner of a war-chariot. The name sakti appears in Hinduism as an item in the list of five weapons supposed to have been possessed by Durgâ in her role as Mahisâsuramardani.35 The others are trisula (trident), khadga (sword), cakra (wheel) and dhanu (bow). As this list includes the object called Trisula (Hindu trident) therefore, it excludes the possibility of the same being identified with the so-called 'triratna (or as Mr. Karunaratne calls it, satti) which is described by some as' a tridental object. Then the object called sakti in this list is not only explained literally, but also is represented pictorially as a spear. Furthermore, there are no clues supplied, either literary or archaeological, to form a definite idea of the pictorial likeness of the description of satti. All pictorial representations presented by Mr. Karunaratne lack, to say with regret, conclusive support with regard to their identity. Elsewhere Mr. Karunaratne refers to instances of satti being employed to adorn the felly of the wheel symbol. Here too it is difficult to presume that the form of the ornament under reference could be conclusively identified as a satti of his description. The two illustrations we cite in this connection (Figs 3 &amp; 4)36 have been originally prepared by Lt. Col. Maisey, the distinguished archaeo logist, who conducted excavations at Sanchi in the company of Sir Alexander Cunningham. They depict, in pen-drawings, the two pieces of sculpture, showing the figures of two wheel symbols discovered from Sanchi. The unit of ornament in series that adorns the felly of the wheel in this case is clearly seen as two objects in unison. One is very clearly identifiable as a spear-head while the identity of the other posess a problem. It resembles an axe with a semi-circular blade the base of which has three short legs jointly forming two semi-circular hollows in between and fastening itself to the felly. This weapon resembles in appearance to the figure (alternating with the figure of the spear) that adorns the felly of the wheel referred to earlier. We come across an object with similar</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S.) 1991/92 21 description forming a component of a necklace (entirely formed of auspicious objects) depicted in a piece of sculpture from the same site, i.e. Sanchi (Fig. 5).37 However, the possibility of identi fying the spear depicted on the felly of this wheel with the satti of canonical reference cannot still be ruled out. There is evidence to prove the association of the spear with the auspicious objects pertaining to the canonical list. This association is very clearly seen on the face of a very old stele lying, discarded, in a pile of fragments in a corner of the sala-patara-maluwa of the Ruvanmâli-sâya. (Fig. 6).3S Judging by the extent of its wearing out and the kind of stone used, i.e. limestone, one could safely presume that it belongs to the period that corresponds with that of Amaravati fame, viz. 2nd-5th c. A.C.. The figure seen on the front face can easily be identified with the kunta—the object under discussion. The figure on the side face of the stele could be taken, in my opinion, as representing the srivatsa. The eminent position enjoyed by both symbols is clear due to the appearance of the chatta symbol seen over their crown. However, what is important here is the presence of two spears (satti) with long shafts, each issuing from the mouth of a ghata (pot) below, and supporting the respective object. It can easily be identified as a spear of a special type with two small brackets fastened to its neck on either side. The tips of these brackets are seen rolled downward each forming itself into a coil. If this object could be recognized as the satti referred to in canonical literature, the object that is mounted on the tip of its blade has to be named differently (We have sufficient evidence elsewhere to prove that it was named kunta or konta, in Shri Lanka and not satti.). In coming back to the figure that appears on the Ruvanmâli sâya, its striking resemblance to the Sanchi figure described earlier is clearly seen. Both symbols agree in all essential points. The only feature that is lacking is the disc which is represented by two circles, one outer and the other within, forming a bare margin between the two circles. The space within the small circle remains plain without being filled by the figure of an open lotus as is the case with the Sanchi example. Furthermore, the stand with three phases to be seen in the Sanchi symbol are absent in the latter. However, it would be safe to conclude that the Shri Lankan example too belongs to the type of its Indian parallels.</page><page sequence="10">22 THE 'KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAV ÂTI-STUPA The most important question that arises here, is the desig nation by which it was known to the people of this country, during the period it was regarded as a sacred symbol. A clue is supplied towards a conjectural identification of the object by the Dhampiyâ atuwâ-gâlapadaya written in the 10th A.C. by King Kassspa V. 39 In describing the form of the kunta, the royal author explains in contemporary Sinhala language 'kunta nam dvi sûciyâ' meaning that 'kunta is two-pronged.' If this explanation is applied to the object of our concern a two-pronged object is to be expected. As explained earlier, both, the Sanchi example as well as ths Ruvan mâlisàya example have only two prongs with a cusp in the middle remaining high or low, as the case may be. Besides, this explana tion excludes the possibility of the kunta being identified with satti which has only a unitary blade. Thus, if we were to identify the figure seen in the sala-patara maluwa as a representation of a kunta, there would be justification in considering it as the kunta slab figured in the Mahavamsa story relating to the reign ©f Silâkâla. It may even be some other kunta slab of similar description. It is easy to understand the attitude of King Silâkâla who was noted for his strong leanings for Mahàyâna in transfering the kunta-slab or the kuntâsana from the premises of a Theravâda insti tution to the Abhayagiri Vihara, an institution which laid greater emphasis on the cult practices of the masses. The people at that time may have made offerings to this now-deserted artifact, with hopes of agricultural prosperity as well as worldly well-being. Still earlier, it may have represented the Buddha in a pre Buddha-image period and would have served as an object of worship for several centuries fulfilling the religious needs of the Buddhists. Thus, if the figure seen on the sala-patara-maluwa were to be recognized as a pictorial representation of a kunta, it is possible to have some idea of the likeness of the kunta enshrined in the Miris avâtiya stupa. It may have been a kunta wrought out of precious metal based on the design of the symbol that has been discussed.</page><page sequence="11">KtlNTA Plate I v.

(SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N S.) 1991/92 23 The decision made by King Dutugàmunu to erect his first giant stupa with a hunt a enshrined in it, would have not been the result of a mere casual observation of this sacred weapon being stuck to the spot where it was planted before the commencement of water-sports at the Tisâ-vàva. It may have been a deliberate act on the part of the king to mark the launching of a campaign to promote agricultural activity as his next step after a victory over a hard-fought war and political unification of the country. It may also have been an act of reviving a cult practice of which the main aim would have been economic prosperity. A symbol has an unchecked course of evolution through the ages, and as Prof. Heinrich Zimmer40 has put it succinctly, 'receiv ing and holding the essence of a new meaning'. Prof. W. Simpson41 observed it as 'changing the scene in which they were once under stood and appearing with a new interpretation in a different system of another time'. This is absolutely true of the kunta discussed herein. The story of its career did not cease either with the Miris avátiya stupa or with the kunta slab of the Ruvanvâli-saya. It has come down the ages giving birth to new forms with fresh inter pretations in different lands of the ancient as well as the medieval world. In Shri Lanka alone we see its transformed likeness in the sësata and murâyudhcâ1 combination in one direction and the Sinhala traditional mask43 in another direction as its final phase of evolution. The story of this career would be an entirely fresh sub ject of inquiry. References : 1. MV. XXVI 9-13 2. Vamsatthappakasini, ed. Ven. Sumangala and Pundit Batuwantudawe p. 358 3. Thupavamsa, ed.

Buddhadatta Nayaka Thera who supplies a translation different to that of Prof. Geiger for the verse in question in his 'Corrections to Geiger's Mahavamsa etc' (1957, p. 47) makes the following comment: "Kunta is not the name of the throne (rather the altar), but of the Vihara. This must be corrected as 'he brought a slab (used for an altar) from the eastern Vihara named Kunta which belonged to the Maha Vihara fraternity, and kept it inthe monastery called Dumarajaka at Abhayagiri."</page><page sequence="14">24 THE 'KUNTA' ENSHRINED IN THE MIRISAV ÂTI-STUPA Nevertheless Ven'ble H. Sumangala and Pundit Batuwantudawe, both being recognized as the most distinguished scholars of their time, renders their Sinhala version (Mahavamsa, ii, Sinhala Translation, p. 22) of the particular verse in conformity with Prof. Geiger who edited and translated the same text two decades later (1928). The Sinhala translation of the verse in question of the two scholars referred to is as follows: 'ctewd tieSadca ç S&lt;88 îtjscîO ÇjS; ©OeroSsf 3525*2» 2J&gt;® qeto ©co-«3 ôS ©SiSes @32» ssjS.' (He offered the water-dues of Rahera canal to the Abhayuttara Vihara and fetched away the kunta-àsana (slab) from the eastern vihara of the Thera school and set up at the Bodhi tree there.) Two stanzas in question are as follows: Raherodakavàramca adâsi abhayuttare puratthimá theriyânam vihârâ kuntanàmaso ânetvâ âsanam tattha thapesi dumarâjake MV. 41.31-32 It should be clear to Pali scholars that the translation supplied by both parties, viz. Ven'ble Sumangala assisted by Pundit Batuwantudawe, and Prof Geiger gives the correct version of the original. Ven'ble Buddhadatta finds Prof. Geiger to be mistaking the text by "sepa rating the word kuntanàmaso into two words as kuntanâma and so" and adds, "that the kunta is not the name of the throne (rather the altar) but ofthe Vihara." However, we observe that the word vihara is given in its ablative form, while the word kuntanâma remains in its stem-form without being flexioned. Therefore, one cannot conclusively prove that the name kunta specifies the vihara and not the dsana. Even if one would argue to say that it was left shortened for the metre one would need to know why a monastery of that period was so named after a symbol well-known to the then Buddhist society of Shri Lanka. It was one of the very popular symbols chosen here as well as in India to represent the Buddha, and it has been in long association with Buddhist worship. It cannot be taken as a mere altar as Ven'ble Buddhadatta believed. It is clearly indicated in the body of the verse concerned that the name of the vihara from which it had been shifted was Puratthima which is also flexioned in the ablative form to agree with Vihara, and therefore it could not possibly have an additional name as suggested by the Ven'ble scholar. It appears that the dsana worship was still prevalent in the island side by side with the image-worship and this may have been the very reason that prompted King Siiàkâla with his well known bias for the Mahâyàna school to transfer the artifact of worship to an institution in his favour. Another weak point of the observations made by Ven'ble Buddhadatta appears to be his mistaking of the word dumarâjake to be the name applied to the Vihara to which the àsana was shifted. The word dumarâjake meaning 'king</page><page sequence="15">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S.) 1991/92 25 of Trees' was applied here to the Bodhi tree and it was used in many instances in all Shri Lankan chronicles in reference to the sacred tree. Besides, there is no literary or archaeological evidence to prove the existence of any monastery by this name associated with the Abhayagiri Vihara. 5.
