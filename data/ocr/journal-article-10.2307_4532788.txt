MOYNIHAN') (Dept. of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, Oxford) (Rec. 8-V-I953) INTRODUCTION The recent paper on "Derived Activities" by TINBERGEN (1952), makes clear the importance of this aspect of behaviour work. The concepts he discusses promise to be useful, not only in the analysis of complex behaviour patterns, but also in throwing light on the fundamental mechanisms under- lying all instinctive activities. The main aim of this paper is to present certain new ideas on displace- ment activities which have arisen from recent observations and experiments. In discussing these latter, we found that much confusion still existed, both in our own minds and in the literature, as regards the distinctions between displacement activities and other related behaviour patterns. We thought it might also be useful, therefore, to give our own clarification of these problems, and thus to present our new ideas in the setting in which we see them. OCCURRENCE OF DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES AND SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS Before proceeding to discuss in detail certain aspects of displacement activities, it is necessary to say something about the circumstances in which these, and other, activities occur. Some of these other activities show certain i) We wish to acknowledge our indebtedness to Dr N.

A. AMBIVALENT MOVEMENTS AND POSTURES This type of behaviour is shown by an animal in which two or more con- flicting drives are weakly activated. The animal manages to "obey" all the activated drives simultaneously. Because of the weak motivation, ambivalent movements and postures are usually a combination of intention movements of the introductory appetitive behaviour belonging to the drives involved. In some cases, however, movements that typically occur later in the chain from introductory appetitive behaviour to consummatory act are also in- tegrated into ambivalent combinations, (e.g. the cases in the Great Tit cited by HINDE, I952, where a threat posture and complete feeding behaviour are combined during food fighting). Although ambivalent combinations of movements may visually resemble various displacement activities, they differ basically from displacement activities in that they are autochthonous (in the sense used by KORTLANDT, 1940). It has long been known that intention movements, like displacement move- ments, may acquire a releaser function and become ritualized (TINBERGEN, I952). Such ritualization must be accompanied by a certain amount of neuro- physiological "emancipation"; i.e. the underlying nervous mechanism changes. It has not yet been definitely established, however, that ambivalent combinations of intention movements may become ritualized. This is cer- tainly a possibility that needs further investigation. B. DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES As a basis for the subsequent discussion, the following definition of these activities can be set down: "A displacement activity is an activity belonging to the executive motor pattern of an instinct other than the instinct(s) activated" (TINBERGEN, 1952). These activities apparently can occur in two different situations. (i). Displacement activities may be performed by an animal in which two or more incompatible drives are strongly activated. Each drive prevents the expression of the other(s). (2). Displacement activities may also be performed by an animal in which o n e drive is, at the same time, both activated and thwarted. Previous work has indicated that a drive may be thwarted in several ways.</page><page sequence="3">68 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN The consummatory act may be physically prevented by some factor in the external environment; or, possibly, the indispensable releasing stimuli may be entirely absent. (Displacement activities do not seem to occur when the releasing stimuli are merely inadequate. Those activities usually called "over- flow" appear under such circumstances). C. "NEUROSIS"' IN ANIMALS We will say little here about this vast and controversial subject. The major difficulty involved in discussing animal ''neurosis" is that the term has apparently been used, by psychologists, to describe several dif- ferent kinds of "abnormal" (i.e. infrequent) behaviour. MASSERMAN (I943), for instance, uses the term "neurotic" to include "substitutive, ambivalent, regressive, and inefficient" behaviour. These categories, of course, include various kinds of behaviour patterns for which ethologists commonly employ different terms. Much "regressive" behaviour, for example, is obviously displacement activity, in the conventional ethological sense. Other types of "neurotic" behaviour (e.g. the extremely unusual passivity sometimes shown by experimental animals subjected to strong motivational conflicts, hyper- activity, or various forms of "phobic" and "counter-phobic" responses in similar situations) have not been studied by ethologists. There seems little doubt that many of them could be described in ordinary ethological terms. In general, the other forms of "neurotic" behaviour seem to develop in much the same circumstances as displacement activities: when several strongly activated drives are incompatible, or when one activated drive is thwarted. It has been suggested that such behaviour appears only when the "available" displacement activities are insufficient outlets for surplus excitation (TINBERGEN, I952); and there is some evidence to support this hypothesis. Considerably more observation of animals, in conflict and thwarting situations, is necessary, however, before the relationship between displacement activities and other forms of "neurotic" behaviour can be clearly understood. D. "OVERFLOW ACTIVITIES" These activities occur when an animal has one drive strongly activated,. and the releasing stimuli, indispensable for the performance of the executive motor patterns of the drive, are inadequate. The releasing threshold may then be greatly lowered, and the activity may "go off" in response to the most meagre or abnormal stimuli. This type of behaviour was first studied by LORENZ (I937), who even</page><page sequence="4">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND TIIWARTING IN ANIMALS 69 suggested that the reaction may occur when there are n o external stimuli. He called such performances "Leerlaufreaktionen" (vacuum acti- vities). As has been pointed out by many critics, it seems impossible, or at least very difficult, to prove the absence of all external stimuli; and there- fore the more inclusive term "overflow activity" (ARMSTRONG, I950) has been used in recent discussions. We think, however, that even this term is open to criticism on several grounds. The reactions that have been called "overflow activities" are appa- rently nothing but reactions to sub-optimal stimuli. The little evidence that has been accumulated seems to show that there is every gradation between reactions to slightly sub-optimal stimuli and reactions to stimuli so far below optimal as to be difficult for the human observer to recognize as stimuli. Furthermore, it should be remembered that "normal" behaviour is itself often a reaction to sub-optimal stimuli; as a good deal of work on "super- normal" stimuli has conclusively shown; (see the review of such cases in TINBERGEN, 195I). Such facts indicate that the term "overflow activity" is unfortunate. The use of such a distinct term would seem to imply that this type of activity is, to some extent, qualitatively different from "normal" behaviour. There is as yet no evidence to prove this hypothesis. Until such proof is forthcoming, it would seem best to discard the term "overflow activity", and to substitute the more non-committal term "reaction to sub-optimal stimuli". E. REDIRECTION ACTIVITIES If, in an animal, two or more incompatible drives are strongly and simultaneously activated by the same stimulus (or complex of inseparable stimuli, such as those provided by the mere appearance of an animal or an object), the conflict of drives may be resolved by the animal "venting" one of these drives upon some third animal or object. That is, the executive motor patterns of one of the activated, conflicting, drives are transferred onto another external object. This, of course, immediately removes a large part of the conflict and relieves the surplus excitation in the Central Nervous System. A very good example of this is provided by the behaviour of male Black- headed Gulls during pair-formation (MOYNIHAN, personal observation). Such a male adopts a territory, where females visit him from time to time. The male is quite placid, when alone on his territory; spending much time sleeping or preening in a relaxed fashion. When a female arrives, however,</page><page sequence="5">70 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN his demeanour changes abruptly. Her arrival stimulates the attack, escape, and sex drives of the male. These drives are, of course, incompatible. The activated attack drive is manifested, not only by actual attacks on the female, but also by the variety of threat postures the male shows toward her. In addition, the male often rushes to vent his attack drive on other animals: other Black-headed Gulls, Shelduck, Lapwing, Oystercatchers, and even human observers. It is obvious, for several reasons that these sudden attacks are not provoked by any behaviour of the attacked animals. First of all, many of the attacked birds are not showing any of the behaviour normally liable to provoke attack. In the second place, although the male is certainly aggressive (he screams attack or threat calls) when he rushes away from the female, he may then have to fly a considerable distance and quite ob- viously have to search around for a scapegoat. Moreover, there is good evidence that a male is usually just as aggressive toward neighbours and intruders late in the season, after the pair-bond has become firmly established, as he is during this pair-formation period. He does not, how- ever, show nearly as much threat behaviour toward the female; and he does not rush off to attack other animals whenever the female arrives. It should be emphasized that, in the above case, the stimulus-complex releasing the male's aggressive behaviour (i.e. the female) remained present when the male's aggressive performance was begun. Thus the female was theoretically available as an object to attack. This performance cannot, there- fore, be considered similar to an "after-discharge". It should also be emphasized that the releasing stimulus-complex here was the one that would also, normally, direct the activity. Except in these special cases of conflicting motivation, a male Black-headed Gull's attack behaviour is always directed toward the releasing stimulus. This type of behaviour would seem to deserve a name, and we would suggest that it should be called a "redirection activity". Redirection activities have been previously included, with several other superficially similar phenomena, under various terms. Redirection activities would certainly be considered a special case of psychoanalytic displacement. In fact, the term "object displacement" might, at first sight, be an even more suitable name than redirection activity. Unfortunately, however, "object displacement" seems to be used by psycho- logists (e.g. MILLER, i948) in a much broader sense; to include such things as reactions to sub-optimal stimuli. The similar term "Objektiibertragungen.", as used by PORTIELJE (1930), also seems to include both redirection activities and a variety of other pbenomena. Examples of redirection activities, similar to the Black-headed Gull case discussed above, have been described in many other species: e.g. the Herring Gull (TINBERGEN, I953, in press) and Ross's Gull (BUTURLIN, I906), in</page><page sequence="6">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 7I cercopithecine monkeys (ZUCKERMAN, I932), and the Prairie Falcon (BENT, 1938). The case of the Prairie Falcon is interesting in that it exemplifies the confusion of interpretation that redirection activities have occasionally caused. When these falcons are disturbed at the nest, by a human intruder, they usually begin to swoop at the intruder. Most of these swooping attacks, however, are not quite completed. Within a few feet of the intruder, the falcons will suddenly swerve to one side or another. This last-minute swerve is undoubtedly due to increase of escape drive as the birds get closer to their opponent. Under these circumstances, Prairie Falcons will attack other birds, such as Barn Owls or Ravens, that happen to pass by. ARMSTRONG (Ioc. cit.) has interpreted this behaviour as a displacement activity. Such an interpretation is obviously incorrect, as the behaviour shown is certainly the executive motor pattern of one of the activated instincts. In all these cases, the conflict of drives has been between the attack drive and some other drive(s); and it is the attack drive that has been transferred onto another animal. Presumably, conflict between drives, other than the attack drive, could also lead to a redirection activity; but such cases would be rather more difficult to identify. In all the previously described cases, moreover, the attack drive has been vented on some other animal rather than on some inanimate object. There are very few examples of this latter in the literature. Probably the best-known example is shown in connection with the displacement grass-pulling of the Herring Gull (TINBERGEN, 1952). Grass- pulling is a displacement activity that occurs when both the attack and escape drives are activated. This grass-pulling differs, however, from the autochthonous collection of nest material, in that the aggressive gull pecks into, and pulls up, the material much more vigorously than when gathering nest material for real building. These pulling and pecking movements are part of the normal fighting pattern of the Herring Gull. It is apparent that here there are autochthonous elements of the attack drive added to the displacement activity. The added autochthonous elements of the attack drive take the form of a redirection activity. Most of the redirection activities that have been described seem to have been the result of a conflict of drives within an animal. Probably, how- ever, such activities may also occur when a single drive is strongly activated and then thwarted. An interesting example of this is mentioned in KORT- LANDT (loc. cit.), from PORTIELJE and SCHUT (I938). When two angry animals are prevented from attacking one another, by an intervening fence, one or both will often turn and attack other animals. This might seem to resemble a reaction to sub-optimal stimuli; but closer inspection reveals that it is probably a true redirection activity. The essential difference between a redirection activity and a reaction to sub-optimal stimuli is quite clear. In the case of a reaction to sub-optimal stimuli, the object (however inadequate) on which the executive motor patterns of a drive are vented is also the object providing the exteroceptive stimuli releasing the activity. In the case</page><page sequence="7">72 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN of redirection, the object on which the executive motor patterns of a drive are vented is not the object that provides the releasing stimuli and that would, normally, direct the activity. The reason why redirection activities have been described at such length, in the above account, is that their relationship to displacement activities is particularly puzzling. Either type of activity may occur when two incompatible drives are strongly activated by the same releasing and directing stimulus-complex. The primary function of both activities seems to be the same: the relieving of surplus excitation in the Central Nervous System. It is then very hard indeed to imagine why, at any given time, one activity is shown instead of the other. Features of the external environment may be determining in this respect; but it hardly seems likely. In the case of the Black-headed Gull, for instance, typical displacement activities seem to occur in situations ap- parently identical with those in which the redirected aggressive behaviour is seen. Possibly the determining factor is the actual strength of the two conflicting idrives. It would, however, be very difficult to say, in the light of our present knowledge, whether redirection activities tend to occur when the two conflicting drives are weaker or stronger than when displacement activities occur. We hope to be able to suggest an answer to this problem after more research has been done. SOME NEW ASPECTS OF DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES A. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN "FEED-BACKS" AND DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES Two examples of displacement activities have recently been observed in the Black-headed gull (MOYNIHAN, I953), which are at first sight difficult to explain. They are as follows; (i) Eggs are removed from the nest of an incubating bird during its absence. When the bird returns and broods it shows displacement nest building, the amount and intensity of which varies directly with the number of eggs removed. (2) Birds, while sitting on their nests, frequently show displacement nest building just before they get up to rearrange the eggs. It has been shown that it is unlikely that any drive other than incubation is activated under these circumstances, so we are dealing, presumably, with (lisplacement activities due to the thwarting of a single drive. The cases are, however, anomalous in that what is usually termed the consummatory act is actually being performed. Thus it is impossible to argue that the appro-</page><page sequence="8">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 73 priate executive motor pattern is physically prevented, neither can essential releasing stimuli be absent. We know this because the bird sits down in a perfectly typical fashion. The factors responsible for the thwarting must obviously be sought among those elements of these two situations which are abnormal. And in both cases it is apparent that the sensory stimuli received by the sitting bird from the eggs are sub-optimal. In the one instance there are not enough eggs; in the other it seems likely that their temperature or arrangement is wrong. Thus something is at fault with the stimuli normally to be expected as a result of the act of sitting; and, if this Ds causing the thwarting, one is at cnce tempted to suggest a mechanism along the lines of the Re-Afference Theory (VON HOLST and MITTELSTAEDT 1950). We might suppose that when the act is initiated, or perhaps even earlier, another centre is charged by an "output copy" of the "normally expected" stimuli. Thus in our examples there would be a "copy" of the stimuli which would normally come from the right eggs in the right positions. If then, following VON HOLST and M1ITTELSTAEDT, we postulate that the energy of this "copy centre" can only be cancelled by the reception of the corresponding feed-back stimuli, it beco- mes apparent that wrong or inadequate feed-back could be responsible for an accumulation of nervous energy and hence lead to a spark-over. This ex- planation would entirely account for the conditions of our examples, and seems the most logical one yet put forward. For a more detailed theory along the same lines see HAYES, RUSSELL, HAYES and KOHSEN. It may be that this is the process whereby drive is normally consumed, and in this sense these could be called cases of thwarting due to the absence of necessary "consummatory stimuli". We feel that this is a new category which should be included among the situations in which a single drive can be thwarted. It would seem therefore that an adequate explanation of our examples demands some revision of ideas concerning the ways in which drive can be consumed. LORENZ (I950) has argued, using his water tank analogy, that the "energy" of an instinctive centre "discharges" through the appropriate motor centres when the consummatory act is performed. But our obser- vations make it clear that, in some situations at least, there can be no appreciable drop in motivation from this cause, and the postulation of con- summatory stimuli seems a necessary alternative. Whether it should be regarded as an addition to or a replacement of LORENZ'S idea cannot be decided on the present evidence. The chief support for LORENZ'S theory comes from examples of vacuum activities, which seem to indicate drop in motivation caused by the performance of the consummatory act alone, since the activity eventually ceases. We have suggested above that many such</page><page sequence="9">74 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN cases may be responses to transitory sub-optimal stimuli, but even if they prove to be valid examples, it is still possible to fit them into the feed-back hypothesis. For although in vacuum activities no "normally expected" feed- back can be received as a result of the activity, nevertheless proprioceptive stimuli are received during its performance, and these may well form part of the consummatory stimuli and thus consume some of the drive. Their relative importance may perhaps vary in different drives. Thus it may be that the facts which led to the idea of "discharge" can be explained as well in terms of the proprioceptive elements of feed-backs, but we lack decisive experiments on this point. It is however indicated by our examples that neither discharge nor proprioceptive stimuli are the only means of consuming a drive. Although a drive is not consumed when the "right" consummatory stimuli are absent, it is possible that the activity in question is sometimes stopped as a result of this absence (often in conjunction with the presence of certain special "wrong" feed-backs)). W. M. S. RUSSELL (I952) has shown that in Xenopus special stimuli from non-ovulating females bring about "unclasping" and hence stop the continued performance of clasping by the male. We think that this and similar phenomena, widespread in Anura, could be inter- preted in this way. It is also possible that certain activities of non-receptive females of Drosophila, serve to inhibit the courtship of males. In these cases it is obviously of advantage that the act should not continue to be directed towards an unsatisfactory object, and these mechanisms may well have evolved to this end. When such inhibition occurs, any displacement activities which appear after the act has ceased could be explained in terms of prevention of the consummatory act. Displacement activities oc- curring before the act has ceased, however, cannot be explained in this way and would seem to call for the interpretation given above. Finally in considering the implications of this hypothesis, one might well imagine that it is more adaptive for a drive to be consumed by the reception of the "right" feed-back stimuli rather than by the performance of the "right" act, provided that situations are likely to occur in which the stimuli are not the inevitable consequences of the act. It is theoretically possible for this to occur whenever the consummatory stimuli are different from the releasing stimuli and yet do not consist entirely of proprioceptive stimuli. For example, in rodents, the consummatory stimuli of the escape drive are possibly stimuli representative of a typical "safe place" for the animal in question. It would be unadaptive for the mere act of running away to consume the drive. B. THE NATURE OF THE SPARK-OVER Virtually nothing is known of the neurophysiology of the spark-over which is involved in true displacement activities. Certain indirect evidence has come to light, however, which makes it worth while reconsidering here</page><page sequence="10">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 75 exactly what is meant by this spark-over or "Ubersprung". Most ethologists probably think of it as a safety-valve-like mechanism which exists in the nervous system of many animals and which operates when one or more drives, which have been strongly activated, are prevented from being con- sumed in the usual way. It appears that such thwarted drives can become so powerful that the nervous system is "forced" to discharge its energy through some apparently irrelevant, out-of-context, activity. There are four main problems involved in the investigation of the nature of the spark-over, as follows: I. The type of nervous pathway taken by the "spark". 2. The hierarchy level [in TINBERGEN'S (I950) sense] of the nervous centre that controls the thwarted activity, and that of the nervous centre that controls the activity used as a displacement activity. 3. The "distance" of the spark-over, or, in other words, how closely related the two centres are in the hierarchy system. 4. The way in which a spark-over has become fixed, or altered, in evolution. (This problem will be dealt with in the next section of this paper.) Concerning the spark-over pathway, it is often visualised as the shortest route between two centres. This is probably due to the electrical connotation -of the term spark-over itself. There is, as far as can be ascertained, no con- vincing evidence that the pathway is, in fact, direct rather then indirect. It is quite plausible that the nervous impulses involved travel up to the higher centres of the hierarchy of the thwarted centre, there to spark-over to another hierarchy. The "distance" up the hierarchy that such impulses travel, before sparking over, could be any "length" on the present evidence. There are, therefore, two basic pathway problems; firstly, whether the route is direct or indirect, and secondly, if it is the latter, to what extent it is thus indirect. It is important to realise that these problems have yet to be solved. Concerning the hierarchy levels of the centres involved, again, little is known. The apparent impossibility of accurate standardisation of such levels provides a great barrier to further investigation. All that can be said at present is that different levels in nervous hierarchies can be involved, both at the sending and the receiving ends of the spark-over. The "distance" of the spark-over is also known to be variable, but, again, such distances can only be judged approximately. For example, it seems that thwarted incubation in the Black Headed Gull can spark-over to displace- ment nest-building or to displacement preening. Now nesting is more closely related, in the hierarchy system, to incubation than is preening and so the "distance" of the spark-over is greater in the latter case. This is so because</page><page sequence="11">76 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN incubation and nesting are both sub-centres of the reproductive hierarchy, whilst preening belongs to a separate hierarchy altogether. In the past, the long-distance spark-over (such as, for example, sex to preening, or fighting to sleep) and the moderately long-distance spark-over (such as, for example, sex to nesting, or sex to parental care) have both been frequently described. It appears as if the fact that short-distance dis- placement activities have not hitherto been described is probably not due to their non-existence, but to their inevitably increased apparent relevancy and expectedness. This will render them extremely difficult to detect. It is possible, however, that future detailed quantitative research will reveal some such short-distance displacement activities, and it should be remembered that, implicit in the present definition of displacement activities is the pos- sibility that the spark-over may occur at any I n s t i n c t L e v e 1. It is necessary to mention here one aberrant example of a spark-over that has been reported in the Ten-Spined Stickleback (MORRIS, 1952). In this species, if male reproductive behaviour is stimulated strongly and then thwarted in a particular way, the thwarted males f ind an outlet by behaving as females. This pseudofemale behaviour, as it has been called, has been reported for other species ifrom time to time, but no causal explanations have previously been forthcoming. In the stickleback case, however, this behaviour appears to be a complex displacement activity. What is so strange about this case is that the fish concerned sparked-over to an otherwise dormant sexual pattern, instead of to a "normal" non-sexual pattern. It appears to be less advantageous for the nervous system of a Ten-Spined Stickleback to spark-over from reproductive to non-reproductive centres, than for this dormant contrasexual pattern to be activated. Male reproductive Female reproductive centre centre 0 00 Fight Nest Sex Parental Fight Sex The above diagram shows the male and female reproductive hierarchies for the stickleback. Common idisplacement activities shown by the male all belong to reproductive sub-centres, and occur when other reproductive sub- centres are thwarted. In the case of the pseudo-female fish, however, a 11</page><page sequence="12">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 77 the reproductive centres were thwarted, so that none of the usual displace- ment activities were available. The result was that these fish, if they were to spark over at all, were forced to do so outside their male reproductive repertoire. The temales do not nest, or take part in parental care, so that sexual behaviour is the only female reproductive activity which is avail- able for the pseudofemales as an outlet, and, as already stated, this was the one used 1). It is surprising, neverti'eless, that the spark-over was to this activity, rather than to, for example, displacement feeding. It is worth noting here that the female Ten-Spined Stickleback, if thwarted in a particular way, shows displacement fanning. Fanning is part of parental care, which, in this species, is performed normally exclusively by the male. The female in such cases is showing pseudomale behaviour and, again, it is difficult to see why this particular (to the female) dormant activity should be used as an outlet by the nervous system, in preference for other normally active patteins. C. COMMENTS ON THE EVOLUTIOiN OF DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES Considerable knowledge, about certain aspects of the evolution of dis- placement activities, is accumulating as more detailed and exhaustive research is conducted on these activities. It now seems clear that natural selection must bring about significant changes in displacement activities as soon as they appear (in phylogeny). There have been many cases cited, for a variety of species, where the thwarting of a certain drive, or the conflict of two particular drives, provokes o n 1 y o n e kind of displacement movement. We should like to call this a "single displacement activity". By contrast, other cases have been cited, where the thwarting of a certain drive, or the conflict between two particular drives, may provoke a n y o n e o f s e v e r a 1 different kinds of displacement movements. These should be called "alternative displacement activities". The whole subject of alternative displacement activities is still in a rather confused state. In only a few species has the existence of such alternatives been established with a reasonable amount of certainty; e.g. the Black-headed Gull (MOYNIHAN, Ioc. cit.). In addition, however, alternative displacement activities have been reported as being performed by a number of other i) Although it has just been discovered (MoRRIs, unpublished) that the females may fight and hold territories, their aggressive behaviour pattern is identical with that of the males, so that female sexual behaviour is the only female reproductive pattern which differs in its actions from the male patterns and is therefore available as a displacement activity for the pseudofemales.</page><page sequence="13">78 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN animals; e.g. the Cormorant (KORTLANDT, IcC. cit.), and the Avocet (MAK- KINK, I936). Many of these descriptions are perhaps incomplete, in that the external circumstances and the internal motivation are not described in sufficient detail. Despite these deficiencies, it seems safe to assume provi- sionally that alternative displacement activities are widespread (at least in birds), as such reports are so common in ethological and ornithological literature. There are probably several distinct types of alternative displacement activities. Any attempt to classify these must be largely theoretical, until more facts have been col- lected; but the attempt would seem worthwhile. True alternative displacement activities include all those cases in which the alternative shown is not dependent upon external circumstances. These should tusually be distinguished from "apparent alternative dis- placement activities", in which the external circumstances do determine which of the alternatives will appear at any given time. The term "true alternative displacement activities" can be used to include two slightly different phenomena: (i) those examples in which two or more alternatives may be shown at the same level of motivation; and (2) those cases where the different alternatives appear at different levels of motivation. For the purposes of the following discussion, all the various types of alternative displacement activities can be lumped together. It is rather difficult, to decide whether single or alternative displacement activities are most likely to be "primitive". Such a decision would also have to be, at the present time, extremely tentative. It is, however, fairly easy to conceive how ancestral alternative displacement activities could be "weeded out", by natural selection, to leave only a single displacement activity. The reverse process, alternative displacement activities replacing (or being added to) an originally single displacement activity would seem to be much less likely. This latter process would probably entail considerably greater changes in the Central Nervous System. In general, it might seem "easier" to eliminate some displacement activities, 'during the course of evolution, than to create entirely new ones. Obviously, whenever alternative displacement activities occur regularly in a certain situation, selection pressure will begin to operate in'favour of one of them. It is highly improbable that all the various alternatives will be equally advantageous or disadvantageous. In the first place, as all displacement activities apparently have the primary function of relieving surplus excitation in the Central Nervous System, it may well be that one of the alternatives is a better "outlet" than the others. Even if this possibility is ignored, however, other factors are undoubtedly important. Any movement of a prey animal is, in itself, dangerous. There will, therefore, certainly be selection pressure in favour of making displacement movements as little noticeable as possible. This may explain, for instance,</page><page sequence="14">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 79 why relatively inconspicuous comfort movements are so common as dis- placement activities. It may also help to explain why some displacement movements appear to be incomplete (i.e. resemble low-intensity forms of their autochthonous examples). Very often, however, the selection pressure in favour of inconspicuous movements will be more than counterbalanced by selection for displacement movements that possess a secondary function. Such displacement activities with secondary functions can, for purposes of convenience, be divided into two groups. The first of these groups in- cludes those activities which have acquired a releaser function. The second group, quite heterogeneous, includes those displacements which have some other secondary function. Displacement activities with a releaser, signal, function have been thoroughly- reviewed by TINBERGEN (I952), who has also discussed the evolutionary process of ritualization. They will not, therefore, be further discussed here. Displacement activities with a non-signal secondary function have hitherto been little studied. One example has been described in the Black-headed Gull (MOYNIHAN, IcC. cit.). The displacement nest-building of this species, occurring when the incubation drive is thwarted, serves to raise and strengthen the nest. Such a reaction may be of considerable value, in certain circumstances. A rather different case has not yet been described in detail. It concerns the fanning activity of the male Three-Spined Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) which, authochthonously expressed, is a nest-ventilating move- ment that serves to aerate the developing eggs. It has been shown con- clusively that this movement is employed as a displacement activity during the sexual phase, before any eggs are present in the nest. It occurs 'as such when the sex drive of the male is thwarted because the female will not respond to his courtship dance. Further, it has been shown that an increase in the amount of sexual thwarting results in an increase of the amount of displacement fanning, (TINBERGEN and VAN IERSEL, I947). An additional function of fanning has now been discovered, but has so far only been mentioned briefly in the literature (MORRIS, loc. cit.). From observations carried out in the field, it was seen that fanning prevented silting-up of the nest, in particular the nest tunnel. When a nest was abandoned by its owner, it soon became covered by the silt that was moving downstream. It is probable that most, if not all, streams and rivers, in which the Three-Spined Sticklebacks breed, have a considerable passage of silt. The value of displacement fanning is therefore quite evident.</page><page sequence="15">8o M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN It should, perhaps, be mentioned that the existence of the de-silting function of fanning in no way affects the validity of previous fanning experiments by TINBERGEN, VAN IERSEL, and others; for all such experiments were carried out in aquarium tanks where silting-up was a constant factor (by virtue of being constantly absent). Displacement nest-building in the Black-headed Gull and displacement fanning in the Three-Spined Stickleback are, therefore, two examples of displacement activities with non-signal secondary functions. As far as we know, they are the only cases that have yet been described in any detail. (ARMSTRONG, Ioc. cit., suggests that the nest-building during floods of a number of different species of birds, e.g. the waterhen, the water rail, the red-head duck, and Montagu's Harrier, may be displacement activity and may have a function rather similar to the displacement nest-building of the Black-headed Gull. This conclusion seems rather premature; as it has not yet been determined, apparently, whether this nest-building of the various species is autochthonous or allochthonous). There is, of course, one particularly interesting difference between the Black-headed Gull and the Three-Spined Stickleback examples. The displace- ment nest-building of the Black-headed Gull, provoked by the thwarted in- cubation drive, sometimes helps to remedy the thwarting situation. The dis- placement fanning of the Three-Spined Stickleback, provoked by a thwarted sex drive, cannot alter the situation that is thwarting this drive. Conceivably, such displacement activities might eventually achieve neuro- physiological "emancipation". They would then cease to be displacement activities; and would become incorporated, as autochthonous motor patterns, in the new drive where they are of such practical advantage. Such "emanci- pation" would be exactly comparable to that which has certainly been under- gone by many originally displacement activities with a releaser function. (Although, of course, there would be no process of ritualization similar to that found in these latter). A search for autochthonous movements, which could possibly have been derived from displacement movements with a non- signal function, might give most interesting results ). The above survey may be of help in suggesting certain principles of caution, to be applied in the interpretation of displacement activities. Any case of alternative displacement activities, observable by an ethologist at the present time, has probably undergone considerable change in the course of evolution. It is also very probable that any single displacement activity is i) Certain species of Agapornis pluck their own feathers, to add to their nest-lining; and ARMSTRONG (ioc. cit.) suggests that this might have originated as displacement preening. Similarly, it has been suggested to us by F. McKINNEY (personal communica- tion) that the down-plucking by ducks, also utilized in nest-building, might conceivably have been derived from displacement preening.</page><page sequence="16">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 81 shown only because the performance of its motor patterns is of "practical"' advantage. It would be, therefore, rather dangerous to interpret either the frequency or physical appearance of a particular displacement movement- as reflecting, altogether reliably, any general arrangement of internal factors. in the Central Nervous System. CONCLUSION The terminological difficulties that arise in the study of comparative ethology stem, in particular, from anthropomorphic pitfalls, and from the- gap that exists between the methodology of many field-workers and labora-- tory research. This paper is an attempt at increased accuracy in descriptions of ethological patterns involving displacement activities and associated phenomena. Certain authors record displacement activities without stating in detail the circumstances which are producing them. Others, however, give suf- ficient detail for it to be quite clear that they have not been observing a. displacement activity at all, but one of the associated phenomena listed at- the beginning of this paper. It is hoped that this paper may be of some help towards greater clarity, in the future, where displacement and related' activities are concerned. SUMMARY The aim of this paper is to present some new comments on the behaviour of animals, when their drives are thwarted or in conflict. The paper has two main sections. The first reviews the types of behaviour shown ini these situations, and the second discusses new aspects of Displacement Activities and' their implications. The following types of behaviour are reviewed: Ambivalent Movements and Postures; Displacement Activities; "Neurosis" in Animals; "Overflow Activities"; Redirection Activities. This last term is suggested for a type of behaviour shown when two or more conflicting drives are simultaneously activated by the same stimulus complex, or perhaps when one drive is simultaneously activated and thwarted. Autochthonous. activities of one of the drives are then shown, but they are directed towards an animal or object other than that releasing and "normally" directing them, (although the latter is available as a goal at the time). The discussion of new aspects of displacement activities falls under three headings. The first leads to a new hypothesis concerning the mechanism by which drive is. consumed. Examples are given of displacement activities occurring during the perfor- mance of the consummatory act of a single activated drive. This suggests that a drive may be thwarted (in the sense that it is not consumed), even when the final motor pattern is being performed. Thus LORENZ's hypothesis that drive is consumed by "discharge" through the appropriate motor centres does not fit these cases. It is suggested instead that drive may in some cases (perhaps always), be consumed only on the reception of certain "feed-backs" or "consummatory stimuli" which would</page><page sequence="17">82 M. BASTOCK, D. MORRIS AND M. MOYNIHAN "'normally" result from the activity. Certain "expected" feed-backs are shown to be absent in the examples given. The adaptive nature of such a method of consuming drive is discussed. Secondly, problems concerning the nature of the "spark-over" are considered. They include: the nature of the nervous pathway; the hierarchy levels of the centres con- cerned; the "distance" of the "spark-over" or the relationship of the centres con- cerned. Ar. example of an unusual type of "spark-over" is discussed. Thirdly, ideas on the possible evolution of displacement activities are considered. .,single displacement activities, or fixed displacement activities shown invariably by a given species in a given situation, are distinguished from alternative displacement activities, where, under similar conditions, one or several possible displacement activities may be shown. It is suggested that one possibility is that single displacement activities may have been selected out from an ancestral condition of alternative displacement activities. Selective factors favouring one displacement activity over another are discussed. They include; efficiency as an "outlet" inconspicuousness, and secondary function, (signal and non-signal). Examples of non-signal secondary functions are considered.</page><page sequence="18">SOME COMMENTS ON CONFLICT AND THWARTING IN ANIMALS 83 LITERATURE ARMSTRONG, E. A.

Im ersten Abschnitt werden die verschiedenen bis jetzt unter solchen Umstanden beobachteten Erscheinungen klassifiziert, im zweiten einige neue Gedanken uiber tYbersprungbewegungen entwickelt. Wir unterscheiden: Ambivalente, autochthone Bewegungen und Stellungen; tYbersprungbewegungen; "Neurosen"; Leerlaufreaktionen; "Redirection activities": das sind autochthone Bewe- gungen, die an einem Ersatzobjekt abreagiert werden, obwohl das ausl6sende und ge- w6hnlich zugleich richtende Objekt anwesend ist. Es wird gezeigt, dass Dbersprungbewegungen manchmal auftreten, wenn die adiquate Endhandlung zwar ablauft, die "feedback" Reize aber nicht empfangen werden. Dieses diirfte darauf hinweisen, dass das Ablaufen der Endhandlung auch im Normalfall nicht immer den Drang ersch6pft. Es erscheint nicht unnibglich, dass "feedback'-Reize immer fur vollstandige Erschopfung des Dranges notwendig sind, was durchaus zweckmiissig ware. Der Mechanismus des tberspringens wird besprochen im Lichte der hierarchischen Struktur der Instinkte; ein bisher nicht beobachteter Fall wird hierbei in Betracht gezogen. Schliesslich werden einige Vermutungen fiber die Evolution von tbersprungbewe- gungen besprochen. Das Bestehen mehrerer alternativen Auswege fur iuberschiissige Erregung wird als phylogenetisch urspriinglich betrachtet, die Beschrankung auf nur einen Ausweg als spezialisiert. Als mogliche Selektionsfaktoren, die eine solche Be- schrankung begiinstigen k6nnten, werden besprochen: die relative Wirksamkeit als Ausweg, Unauffalligkeit der Bewegung und sekundar erworbene (Signal- oder andersartige) Funktion.</page></plain_text>
