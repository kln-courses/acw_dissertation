Vol. I, pp. xlviii + 423; Vol. II, pp. xiii + 438. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1938. 30s. T.HE late Prof. Bowman's Studies in the Philosophy of Religion is an inter- esting work, but its interest is more personal than philosophical; judged as a body of evidence for the beliefs it was designed to establish it must be pronounced a failure. Prof. Bowman was too ardently worshipping by temperament and too habituated to a particular circle of religious beliefs and practices to maintain at the critical points in his argument a philosophical temper, and the method of exposition that he chose made it disastrously easy for him to conceal from himself that he was often assum- ing the conclusions that he set out to prove. After establishing, successfully enough but perhaps at too great length, his right to use the word religion in its normative sense, Prof. Bowman proceeds to trace the development of religion from its most primitive known forms to its completed concept; an enterprise that in its mere statement tacitly assumes that the completed, ideal meaning of religion is known, and not, as may possibly be the case, a faintly glimpsed and distant goal. It is evident that without the most careful preliminary discussion of criteria of significance and development such a scheme will have little value. Prof. Bowman does not altogether neglect to prepare the ground. He criticises Durkheim for too exclusive a concern with primitive religion, and the Enlightenment, rather superficially and with evident bias, for seeking the beliefs common to all religions. For his own part he favours the method of interpreting beginnings in the light of their later development and stresses what he calls the principle of transcendental realism which, however, seems to amount to no more than the contention that because the realisation of values or, at any rate, of moral values-as also the existence of religion-implies the existence of persons the good should be defined as, " That which renders existence personal." The root of religion, Prof. Bowman maintains, is the desire for life combined with an animistic view of Nature; this desire, however, only becomes religious when it has acquired an ideal element. But it would seem that at least three different desires with their associated value-judgments may be referred to: firstly, the desire, on conditions, to continue alive. This, though Prof. Bowman does not recognise it, is a form of the desire for a good or better state of affairs; it implies one or more unspecified value-judgments, a beginning of ethics. Secondly, there is the desire to approve life, implying the value-judgment of religious optimism, that all life, or all being, is good. Thirdly, the desire for " eternal life," implying the judgment, that only an otherworldly life is good. Prof. Bowman to some extent admits these differences but hardly appears to</page><page sequence="2">238 NEW BOOKS. notice the risks of bringing together such different and even incompatible attitudes under the one phrase " the desire for life." Since, at first sight, all existence is by no means good, a problem and a distinction emerge. The problem is met in one of two ways, firstly, as, by Job: since our ignorance leaves open the possibility that existence is good on the whole, therefore we can still assert that in fact it is so. Secondly, there is the answer of mysticism: all that we take to exist is illusion and therefore not relevant to the goodness of reality. Prof. Bowman is sympathetic. He has no epistemological objection to the familiar mystic principle that the knower is everything he knows or is aware of. But, nevertheless, he sees that the root motive of mysticism is self-expansion-though he does not use this expression: 'I alone have value and reality' ' I am, I must be alone without a second.' This is self-destructive because it becomes, ' I am the world-ground, the whole, and all distinctions are illusory.' The personal becomes the entirely impersonal, and because it does so, and because the mystic's belief in his experienced transcendence of selfhood is plainly false, Prof. Bowman condemns mysticism as fatal to religion. However little one may sym- pathise with mysticism, one notices that it is assumed that religion must remain personal, and that other motives leading to the denial of the self are not noticed. For example, power worship, which is surely one of the roots of religion, tends to place all value and reality in the Power; and Prof. Bowman himself says on a later page: " The thing that matters is not that the finite subject should continue to exist but that God liveth." That he is able in the same paragraph to describe this worthless finite as " inexpressibly valuable in the eyes of God " hardly helps; nor does a belief in the worthlessness of the human self allow, if true, a different state of affairs from mysticism, because the belief has a different motive. One may notice briefly Prof. Bowman's attempt to show that so very personal a religion as Confucianism is impersonal; because his argument seems to amount to the contention that a person who is not defined by relation to a supreme divine being is not a person at all, and this assumption -for it is little if anything more-plays an essential part in his concluding argument for the validity of religion, and, indeed, one might say throughout his work. The distinction that emerges is that between the religious and the secular. " The enfranchisement of the spirit in the world of religious values is at the same time the disenfranchisement of nature." Essentially, as elsewhere explained, because man cannot relate himself in a personal way to nature. But another principle is almost immediately asserted: " It (anthropomorphism) commits the fatal error of deifying humanity," and in the same paragraph, " man necessarily places himself in a position of perpetual inferiority to the divine being." In dealing with morality, Prof. Bowman condemns a naturalistic morality because it is without obligation, and a morality of motive be- cause it is left in the air; in the latter case his argument seems to depend upon overlooking the relation of morality to goods which are not moral. Here, too, he assumes that persons must be related to a divine being and asserts that, " The assumption we are making (of the existence of a divine Person) is one with which the concept of obligation stands or falls.'" Later he says, in effect, that obligation means accountability to God. Other assumptions are that happiness cannot be obligatory, that a morality without obligation (in his sense) must be hedonistic, that the moral end is integration. In the succeeding chapter we see still more</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 239 plainly that Prof. Bowman has lost sight of any distinction between the completed concept of religion and his own faith. He is much concerned to establish a difference in kind between moral progress and religious regeneration. He argues firstly that religious morality is far better be- cause it offers a sudden and complete transformation; and then is content to meet the fact that the transformation does not take place, with the plea that the religious man is " credited " with perfect righteousness. Assumptions made here and in the preceding chapter, though nominally assumptions as to the meaning of religion, are in effect final, for they are not afterwards called in question. In Part IV, Prof. Bowman at length reaches the problem of validity. He devotes much space to arguments designed to show that subjects are not objects, that there are selves and that there is activity. The word object is used in at least three meanings: the epistemological object, the physical object, and with an ethical reference nearly equivalent to tool or means. I doubt whether Prof. Bowman was always clear that to prove something about the relation of selves to one of these kind of objects was not to prove it about the others. Prof. Bowman also contends that there are experiences which are not experiences of anything, and that an earlier appearance be- comes a later one so that he can say that present experience " comprises the total content " of past experience. This, like the similar contentions in his paper, " Spirit Time," read before the Aristotelian Society, is designed to justify certain religious conceptions and would collapse with more ac- curate distinctions between objects, appearances (sensa or appearings) and acts of apprehension. To complete his argument Prof. Bowman requires to assert that the individual (justifiably) makes a claim to unconditional personal existence, that this involves as before, relation to God, and that God's existence is established by the necessity for a universal subject, an idealist argument, though Prof. Bowman does not claim to be an idealist; this may well be one of the points that he would have dealt with less abruptly if he had lived longer. Professor Bowman's book is long and discursive. Enough has perhaps been said to show that he described and discussed life and the universe from the standpoint of his own faith, when he intended to give sufficient reasons for believing that faith to be true. One is left with the general impression that he hardly had in mind among possible alternatives to his own creed, anything but some sort of behaviouristic naturalism with a hedonistic ethic; a limitation which must have made his enterprise seem to him more hopeful that it was. It would not be fair to conclude without emphasising the fact that Prof. Bowman was throughout attempting to show that reason confirmed his faith and that to reason he was, unlike many of his contemporaries and successors, never consciously false. E. W. EDWARDS. La question Platonicienne. Par RENE SCHAERER. Paris: J. Vrin, and Neuchatel: Secretariat de l'Universite, 1938. Pp. 272. 60 fr. (French). THIs work consists of some valuable studies in the relation between form and thought in Plato's writings. M. Schaerer begins by asking, Is there a Platonic question, and if so, what is it ? He remarks that Platonism is, in its outlines, one of the</page><page sequence="4">240 NEW BOOKS. simplest of philosophies, and nevertheless Plato is the most exasperating of the writers of the ancient world. There is always something which prevents us from making a direct inference from the works to the author. The ground is strewn with the wreckage of systematic interpretations of Plato, and it is no use adding to their number. Nor are these studies intended as a complete guide to the Dialogues on their literary side, though such a work has still to be written and would be useful. They aim at an interpretation of the thought through the literary form, and vice versa. We will pass over the first third of the book, which consists of a review of some of the constant factors in the Dialogues-Socratic irony, question and answer, myth, digressions, etc. We then come to an interesting account of Dialectic. The method of Dialectic was really practised by Plato from the very beginning-indeed, taken over from Socrates. Plato also, in the later Dialogues, reduced it to theory, and this theory is the fulfilment and explanation of his practice. Dialectic starts as a criticism of common-sense beliefs, and its first effect is to prick the bubble of false opinion. The early Dialogues are quite negative: they simply make the reader conscious of his ignorance, by revealing to him a pair of contrary opinions. And as Plato sometimes took two Dialogues to develop such a contrast, nothing can be inferred from the fact that he sometimes seems to end in a positive solution. What is it, then, that first illumines our ignorance, and enables us to make a choice between such alternatives ? Plato replies that it is the knowledge of the Good. As the supreme standard of value, the Good makes it possible to select what is genuine and reject what is spurious. Having once viewed the Good, the dialec- tician can revisit the familiar world-he runs no risk of falling a victim to fresh illusions. A display of Dialectic is given in the latter part of the Parmenides. It shows us the method at an incomplete stage, when, as it were, the Sun has not yet risen. All possible opinions are considered-each in turn is taken as the " hypothesis "-but no preference or conclusion is stated. With this should be contrasted the more complete Dialectic of the Sophist and Statesman. On Plato's first attempt to find a definition of the sophist, he finds himself in face of a baffling series of alternatives. Worse still, he is in grave danger of confusing the sophist with the philosopher- he knows that one lives in the region of not-being, the other in that of being; but he is at first unable to distinguish these from each other. He seeks help, not indeed from knowledge of the Good (which does not figure in the Sophist), but from an examination of some of the most abstract Ideas. Knowledge then begins to supersede ignorance; truth is dis- tinguished from semblance, and the philosopher from the charlatan. Similarly in the Statesman the true ruler of men is, for a time, indis- tinguishable amid his imitators and rivals. The vision of the Good, contained here in the form of a myth, enables the distinction to be made. Thus in these Dialogues, and in the Phaedrus, a positive kind of Dialectic begins to make its appearance. The method which had been illustrated in the Parmenides was inconclusive -and hypothetical; that practised in the Sophist has a direction and a purpose. There is, then, a theoretical scheme " towards which all the Dialogues, whatever their length or importance, tend." (1) The mind is at first in a state of illusion-i.e., sense-perception, or false or unjustified opinion. (2) By Dialectic it is elevated to the state of ignorance; it knows the alternative opinions, but cannot yet choose between them. (3) A third</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 241 stage is reached with the intuition of the Good, under one form or another. (4) The mind can then return to the object from which it started, and define it in so far as it is real. The reviewer has formed a most favourable opinion of this portion of the book, but he is doubtful whether Plato would altogether endorse this statement of his method. Surely Dialectic is not always a clear choice between good and bad, spurious and genuine-it is, no less frequently, a reconciliation of alternatives, each of which contains a part of the truth. This is, I think, well illustrated by Plato's treatment of being and not- being. He does not get out of his difficulty by discovering a safe criterion of being or reality-but by acknowledging that being and not-being are inseparable. As the price of saying that X is, we must admit that in certain senses it is not. Similarly the method of division by dichotomy does not really involve a value-judgment, as M. Schaerer says it does. It simply enables the dialectician to say that there are two, or three, or more species of a genus. He may, of course, take more interest in one of these than in the remainder; but he does not reject them in the light of his insight into the Good. Where, one may ask, is the Good mentioned in these dialectical Dialogues ? The real peculiarity of Plato's treatment is that he regards the species of a genus as a pair of contraries, whose conflicting natures are reconciled in the genus itself. M. Schaerer does not, indeed, entirely forget that it is the function of Dialectic to find a reconciliation between opposites. He says rightly that Plato discarded the belief in simple Ideas, in favour of a belief in " mixed " entities, i.e., those which possess both unity and plurality, and are divisible, but not to infinity. He says, again quite rightly, that according to Plato's theory of definition in the Sophist and Philebus, the visible world is approached from above the mind accomplishes " une sorte de detour strategique, lui assurant la victoire." The fault of the exposition given by M. Schaerer lies in his failure to see that Plato's Dialectic, in this later phase, no longer requires the notion of the Good, or at least is not primarily concerned with it. He does not distinguish sharply enough between the two great phases of Plato's thought; he reads the later Dialogues in the light of a value-judgment which is not really there, and goes on to make a false contrast between the single-minded Dialectic of the concluding phase and the open-minded Dialectic of the earlier phase. The book also includes an interesting review of Plato's aesthetic theories, in relation to his practice as an artist. The Dialogues do not mirror ex- ternal life in its trivial details, but they do aspire to be " imitations " of an ideal, and in this respect resemble the creations of Greek art. " In this sense the Dialogues are all poems and pictures; moreover, they are, and aspire to be, authentic philosophical tragedies." Dialectic does not differ from art in that its creations stand on a higher plane but in the fact that the dialectician is ready to avow the inadequacy of the likeness he makes. " Plato, then, conceived of philosophy as an art." M. Schaerer amuses himself with the fancy of a " philosophical painter." Disdaining perspective and optical illusion, " he will represent his model in as synthetic a way as he can, somewhat like the Egyptian frescoes which portray a complete man, as seen in profile and face-to-face (Laws, 656-657). The true painter will consider his model from all angles; he will rapidly encircle it; then, turning his gaze away from it, he will try to get an intellectual grasp of its complete essence. Next, taking this essence for the starting-point of his creation, he will try to impart to the canvas as much of it as it is able to receive." 16</page><page sequence="6">242 NEW BOOKS. It is astonishing how the latest writers agree in trying to acquit Plato of hostility to art. In this country Mr. Tate and Prof. Collingwood have been proving that he did not mean the least harm to the poets; we shall soon delude ourselves into believing that there is a vigorous justification of poetry and painting in the Republic. Obviously it is a fact that Book III differs widely from Book X, and is much milder; and again, some of the invective which Plato directs against " poets " might be directed against certain forms of poetry, not poetry as such. But he surely concludes by saying that he has no place at all for poetry other than " hymns to the gods, and encomia upon good men "; and if he intended to allow his philosophers to paint or write poetry, either as a diversion or for instruction, this would be the place to mention it. As to his conceiving philosophy to be an art, and viewing his Dialogues as poems, there seems to be a double misapprehension. Firstly the Dialogues themselves are not, in the highest sense, philosophy; Plato repeatedly says that the attempt to incorporate truth in writing is hopeless. Thus it could in no case follow that philosophy and poetry were similar. In the second place, Plato never suggests that his Dialogues are poems. He thinks that they belong to the genus -7aL8'a, amusement; but he does not say that the pleasure which they give is that proper to art. M. Schaerer, and likewise Mr. Tate, say that a philosopher acquainted with the Ideas would be able to imitate the essence of things, and so give aesthetic pleasure without misleading the intellect: Plato never hints that this is possible, and he definitely says that anyone who enjoyed knowledge would regard imitation as a waste of time. Prof. Collingwood says that Plato, in Book X, only means to dismiss imitative poetry, and that there remains much poetry which is not imitative. This may be verbally correct, but Plato's argument in Book X affects poetry and painting as such; it is not only dramatic poetry, but poetry as such that he condemns as a degrading and mendacious activity. M. Schaerer speaks of an ecrivain-philosophe; Plato of an eternal quarrel between philosophy and poetry, which is never likely to be settled. Stories-myths -there must of course be in his Republic, for they are required in the early education of the guardians; and the authors of such stories are, irL Book III, still described as poets. We can only suppose that the situation is changed after the new arguments of Book X, and that the philosophers themselves supply the place of professional poets. But they do not beat the poets at their own game; they play the game so differently that there is no sense in calling it the same game. Nevertheless, these studies make an important contribution to the understanding of Plato. One may criticise them in detail, but it is a credit to the author's learning and imagination that on almost every page he offers something to criticise. D. J. ALLAN. On Understanding Physics. By W. H. WATSON, Assistant Professor of Physics, McGill University. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1938. Pp. xii + 146. 7s. 6d. PROF. WATSON'S short book on the philosophy of physics is of an unusual and interesting kind. He makes no attempt (indeed he is scornful of attempts) to base a philosophy on physics or physics on a philosophy. And he has little use for a purely historical account of the evolution of physics or for its study as a sociological phenomenon. Instead, he puts</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 243 forward logical considerations derived largely from Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and from his lectures at Cambridge between 1929 and 1934. " The function of philosophy in the sense with which we have been dealing is to clear up our understanding of the use of symbolism, and to remove the discomfort sometimes caused by our notation. The meaning of 'the philosophy of physics ' ought to be ' clearing up under- standing of physics ' " (p. 21). With this aim in view, Prof. Watson directs his attention almost ex- clusively to the " methods of representation " used by physicists. " In physics we choose the particular method of representation adequate to the purpose in mind, just as a carpenter chooses on one occasion a saw and on another a plane to give a particular shape to a piece of wood " (p. 44). Thus different methods of representation are developed to deal with the different physical problems that present themselves. The Newtonian method gives place to the Einsteinian, the atomistic to the wave-mechanical. Nevertheless, the earlier is as adequate as the later for representing some physical facts. In the latter half of the book Prof. Watson applies his logic to difficulties in modern physics. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is shown to be expressible by means of a determin- istic representation: "apparent indeterminate?ess of description arises when we represent the pictures given according to our theory by a method which allows a finer grain of representation than the theory actually attempts to provide, and when, in addition, we forget this matter of fine- ness of grain in interpreting the picture" (p. 90). " Substances " are treated as the fixed elements in a given method of representation of a changing state of affairs: " in any representation all that is required of substance is to mark places in the space of the representation " (p. 100). The final chapter (which presupposes a considerable knowledge of mathe- matical physics) explains how the symbolism of electricity may be con- sidered as an extension of the Hamiltonian symbolism of mechanics per- mitting the expression of " more complex possibilities " (p. 131). To the extent that I understand Prof. Watson I think that I agree with most of what he says; but he is frequently so unclear in his exposi- tion that I do not believe that he will communicate his meaning to a reader who has no previous acquaintance with contemporary logical thought. The difficulty arises principally out of his account of methods of representation. For throughout the book he talks about these in two ways which are mutually inconsistent. (1) He sometimes says that the method of representation determines, not " what must be the form of the actual pictures we draw," but " what pictures are possible " (p. 52). And in his preliminary general remarks he says that a proposition (which is " a picture of reality ") is "descriptive " in the sense that " it will be true or false when the reality described has taken place" (p. 29) : " the fact that the proposition is not true does not affect the logical struc- ture of the proposition " (p. 31). This, though expressed unsatisfactorily in the. " picturing " language taken (not quite faithfully, I think) from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, seems to me sound doctrine: the language, or method of representation, which is used determines what propositions can be expressed in the language, but not whether an empirical proposi- tion expressed in the language is true or false. (2) But in other places he writes as if a scientific theory (i.e., a proposition expressed by a par- ticular mode of representation) cannot be false. E.g., "what could be described by ordinary language and was in disagreement with fact cannot be described by the theory " (p. 19); " we can describe the motion of the</page><page sequence="8">244 NEW BOOKS. planets round the sun over a few years without introducing relativity" (p. 53). But surely we can describe the motion of the planets over any number of years by Newtonian mechanics using pre-relativity methods of representation: observation of Mercury has shown that such a de- scription would be false. Newton's mechanics do not differ from Ein- stein's only in using different methods of representation: they also yield different empirical results. The confusion appears again when Prof. Watson says, " What we have called the laws of nature are the laws of our methods of representing it " (p. 52). Now I agree that a law of nature may appear as an empirical proposition in one mode of representation, but as a logically necessary proposition (a " rule of language ") in another mode. E.g., what is expressed by the sentence " Every velocity is less than the velocity of light " is empirical in the Newtonian language and logically necessary in the Einsteinian. But the fact that different modes of representation make different propositions logically necessary (and indeed that any particular proposition can be made logically necessary by choosing a suitable mode in which to represent it) does not entail that there are no empirical laws of nature. On the contrary, if we did not use our methods of representation to express very general empirical proposi- tions, the methods would be of no interest tophysics, which is an em- pirical science. Prof. Watson has been very much influenced by the logic and mechanics of Hertz, whom he quotes several times. But he does not quote a sentence in which Hertz remarks of the customary exposition of mechanics that " it fails to distinguish thoroughly and sharply between the elements in the image [representation] which arise from the necessities of thought, from experience, and from arbitrary choice " (Principles of Mechanics, p. 8). It is exactly this defect which I find in Prof. Watson's book. In various places he discusses why one method of representation is better than another. He suggests as criteria that a good method does not lend itself to misuse and to consequent philosophical discussion (p. 38); that " a method which gives correctly the possibility of representing nature with greater detail than another, is thought of as the better method " (p. 50); that a good method has " wide application " (p. 53); and that " it is good to take advantage whenever we can of the symbolic systems with which mathematics provides us " (p. 55). But he regards none of these criteria as essential (indeed he thinks that methods having " wide application " frequently lead to unprofitable philosophical discussion): the only practical criterion for the best method is that it is the one pre- ferred by the physicist at the moment in getting on with his job of work. Consequently, he is very distrustful of regarding physics as " a single theory ", when it is " actually a conglomeration of methods of repre- sentation " (p. 43). Though I am thoroughly sceptical of the " unity of science " programme, I cannot bring myself to think that the unification of physics is a false ideal, nor that a method of representation which is applicable to a wider field of physical phenomena than an alternative ,one is not ipso facto the better. But I suppose these may be merely imetaphysical prejudices of which I am not yet cured. Prof. Watson, in writing this book, has attempted an extremely diffi- cult task. The logical way of thinking derived from Wittgenstein is new, and has not yet been systematically expounded by its originator. So it is no wonder that Prof. Watson's use of Wittgenstein's logic in eluci- dating physics is frequently open to criticism. The book is undoubtedly stimulating; and should be of value to physicists (to whom it is primarily</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 245 addressed) who know something of contemporary logical discussion, and to philosophers who know a considerable amount of physics. It is a pity that it is not written in rather better English: though there are many happy phrases, such stylistic defects as the employment of " relative " as an adverb, and the considerable use of the impersonal " one ", make ugly reading. R. B. BRAITHWAITE. An Essay on Critical Appreciation. By R. W. CHURCE. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1938. Pp. 299. 10s. 6d. BY critical appreciation the author means, taking the adjective in its etymological sense, appreciation that is accompanied by discrimination of the effective characteristics of the object responded to. He opposes it to "mere taste," which is declared to be " fatuous " (p. 262). It is wsthetic when-this is taken for granted-the discriminated character- istics are felt to be satisfying in and for themselves. Whether the dis- crimination must be clear and conscious is not brought out. If, as often happens, a spectator of a picture, analysing itC becomes aware of some special aspect and then realises that it is this aspect that accounts for his former enjoyment of the picture, was his former enjoyment aesthetic ? Most psychologists would say that in such a case implicit discrimination preceded explicit discrimination. To deny that implicit discrimination can be aesthetic would be intellectualistic and dogmatic; to affirm that it can be is not compatible with dismissing "mere taste" as "fatuous," unless by " taste " the author means something lower than implicit dis- crimination, in which case he is using the word irrelevantly. On the problem of analysing out the kinds of characteristic to which we aesthetically respond, the author is at bis best. He has in view almost entirely the graphic and plastic arts, which is an advantage; books about art-in-general tend to be either encyclopaedic or intolerably vague. The kinds of characteristic to be discriminated are given as matter, form, and expression, and each of these is expounded with skill and illustrated from an excellent background of knowledge of the visual arts. In a picture, for instance, the material is the surface and the pigments applied to it; the forms are the relations of line, mass, colour, and luminosity; and the expression is on the one hand the gaiety or sombreness or suchwise of the colours, the smoothness or agitation of the lines and so on, on the other hand the representative significance of both the materials and the forms (the two kinds of expression being well designated as immanent and referential respectively). That the materials and methods used in a given picture limit the artist's possibilities is properly stressed, and the account given of what can and cannot be done in tempera as distinguished from oil will be illuminating to those who approach all paintings in what- ever media with the same expectations. Expectation should be based on relevant knowledge, and relevant knowledge enlarges critical appreci- ation. Dr. Church's treatment of these questions seems to me to be yet another indication of the great influence in the States of the analytical work of A. C. Barnes. When Dr. Church leaves these paedagogical matters for the theoretical question of the meaning of the term " beauty " I find him unhelpful. He is concerned above all else to demolish the supposition that the appropriate use of this one term in many diverse instances involves the presence in</page><page sequence="10">246 NEW BOOKS. these of one common feature or group of features. He admits that logically the use of one term in many instances implies some sort of re- semblance among these instances, but he maintains that there are two sorts of resemblance, one being the repetition of the same features, as in shillings of the same mintage, the other being presence within the same order, the only sense in which, for instance, red resembles blue. Since no one has yet been able to point to any one property or set of properties possessed by all the very various things admitted to be beautiful, we are told that we must accept " beauty " as a universal of the same type as " colour," as indicating not a constant determinate property but a series, range or order of determinate properties. Any common referent of " beauty," as of " colour," would be indeterminate, and-this is made a tiresome refrain in the book-" the indeterminate is nothing." I suspect here a confusion between the indeterminate in existence and the indeterminate in meaning; the latter is present in the greater part of our knowledge and therefore cannot be nothing. In the end Dr. Church makes beauty a property of the entire situation in which a person finds an object satisfying in itself (p. 122). Now this looks very like a definition, like the statement of a feature common to all beauties. Dr. Church anticipates the objection (pp. 280 f.), but his answer-that he denies any satisfaction " as such " or in vacuo-is surely irrelevant. The point is that he char- acterises all aesthetic appreciation by the presence of a certain sort of satisfaction. To save himself he would have to read " satisfaction " nominalistically, and this would consist in denying not merely the existence of a " satisfaction as such " but also that concrete satisfactions have any felt identity. The outlook is strongly empiricist. It is maintained that the only beauties that can be significantly discussed are " beauties in fact," that is, actual appreciations; and it is supposed to follow that aesthetic criteria must be empirical also. Those who believe in an absolute or transt empirical standard are said, with a lapse of taste not infrequent in this book, to be " self-righteous " (p. 258), which is too badly chosen a term to have its intended sting. Realising that criteria cannot be demonstrated empirically, Dr. Church concludes that they must be submitted and received as hypothetical. That this need not lessen one's confidence in them is shown by the downrightness of the author's own incidental sesthetic judgments. Unfortunately, he does not proceed to give us his own hypothetical criteria. Having both affirmed that we must keep to the actually valued and denied that there is any necessary connection between being valued and being valuable (p. 249), he should have given some hints of the principle by which the valuable can be picked out from the merely valued. His claim that the erection of some characteristics that are in fact valued into criteria " will yield a view of value-criteria as something more than wholly personal in their bearing " (p. 254) suggests a confusion traces of which keep appearing in the book, the confusion, namely, between the viewpoints of the art-historian and the art-critic. His discussion of the Egyptian canon of figure-representation ends with the remark that the exposition " may serve to indicate the need of a practised acquaintance with [the canon], for the appreciation of the sculptures and wall-paintings of whose proportions it is the canon " (p. 177); and his account of the modifications of the convention of frontality in Greek figure-sculpture reveals the same assumption that to apprehend the canon of a given ivork of art is to appreciate it, or at any rate ought to bring appreciation with it. But in such cases the appreciation may often,</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 247 and often rightly, be technical, archaeological or historical, not westhetic. The author's practical intention-to encourage appreciation based on as wide a knowledge as possible of the relevant technical and historical matters-has here obscured the problem of distinguishing the aesthetic interest from other forms of interest in material that can be regarded sthetically. The book is loosely constructed and very repetitious; also no one audience has been kept in view, for while much of it takes familiarity with philosophical discussion for granted, elsewhere terms like " apper- ception-mass " and " association " are introduced with simple explana- tions. A well-stored mind has put the work together in haste. The printers have given it a beautiful form. A few trivial misprints have escaped notice-the accent in pieta' is misplaced several times on pages 53 f.; palette (137), artistes (140), Gioconda (201), maitresse (208), sculptures and Gaudier-Brzeska (209) are misspelt; on page 262 deprecation should be depreciation; and on page 154 (last sentence) refraction seems to be a slip for reflection. T. E. JESSOP. A Source Book of Gestalt Psychology. Prepared by WILLIS D. ELIS. London: Kegan Paul. Pp. xiv + 403. 21s. IF we draw a row of dots on a piece of paper in such a way that the gap between the second and third is larger than the gap between the first and second, and the gap between the third and fourth is equal to that between the first and second, and that between the fourth and fifth is equal to that between the second and third and so on, we provide ourselves with the appearance of pairs of dots. The members of the pairs belong together. If we draw alternate dots and circles equidistant apart, and then another line of dots and circles under the first, the dots will tend to belong together, and so will the circles. In fact there are numbers of ways of drawing meaningless figures so that one part belongs together with another. This belonging together is the basis of 'Gestalt' psychology. When a piece of grey paper is placed on, or next door to, a black surface, the grey paper will look paler because of 'brightness contrast', but the paleness will be different if the grey paper breaks in upon a well-marked figure from what it would be if it were merely next door to a part of the figure, even though in the latter case the amount of black surrounding it is more than it is in the first. If you are shown a shape several times, you may well be able to recognise it on a subsequent occasion, but the chances are tremendously reduced if it is incorporated into a larger figure, when, that is to say, it 'loses its identity' and belongs to a bigger whole. The colour and pronouncedness of a surface depend on the appre- hension of the surface as a surface rather than on the actual amount of light reflected. The same amount of reflected light viewed through a hole in a piece of cardboard will look different from what it would look if the cardboard were not there and the surface seen as an object. Birds and chimpanzees have been shown to respond to figures rather than to 'absolute' sensations. Our behaviour is determined by the background on which it is performed. "Suppose a certain act has become intolerable. By changing the situ. ational background a repetition of the act can easily be secured. . . . In</page><page sequence="12">248 NEW BOOKS. one experiment a single word was written over and over until the subject declared that he would not write it again. 'Very well', said the experi- menter, 'we will stop; by the way, please write that word on the back of the sheet so that I can remember which experiment this was.' This the subject did without difficulty." Furthermore, our behaviour is really made up of patterns in which the parts belong together. So unified and persistent may the tensional systems which produce our patterns of activity be that when we are interrupted there is a tendency which inclines us to resume our task as soon as possible, and to remember uncompleted tasks much more than completed ones. When a wound has caused the halves of both retinae to stop functioning, we have a situation in which we can experiment on the influence of be- longing together by stimulating across the border which separates the ' good' from the 'bad' parts of the eye. Here again the stimulus which falls on the insensitive part of the retina is seen if it belongs together with the stimulus which is operating on the healthy part. All these experiments and many more have been selected for this Source Book of Gestalt Psychology. The same theme runs through the whole book: what makes a difference is ' figure "rather than ' elements ', parts and wholes rather than 'aggregates' mysteriously dealt with by a higher faculty. The energy, enthusiasm and personal charm of Koffka, K6hler and Wertheimer are responsible for an enormous output of experimental work. Their own students have tackled a prodigious number of new problems, and medical scientists, such as Fuchs, Gelb and Goldstein, were infected by the ' whole-wise ' approach. In the early days the work was scattered though it emanated from a central body; now the central figures are scattered and live independent existences. Koffka and Lewin, the most lively survivors, are in America and their work is easily accessible to English readers, but the articles published immediately after the war are not so easily come by, and Prof. Ellis has done a great service in selecting and abridging thirty-four of them in this volume. There is, as I have indicated, a special value attaching to the collection of these rather inaccessible papers, but dare we hope that Dr. Ellis has inaugurated a new kind of book ? How useful it would be to have reputable source-books of works in, e.g., Educational Psychology or Psycho-analysis. A source-book performs a different function from that performed by the populariser or text-book writer; the text-book writer refers his readers to articles while the source book gives the articles in greater fulness. In these days 'keeping up' with research is no easy matter, and I for one should welcome more books of this kind. Of course the matter of choice will always be a difficulty. There are papers I should like to have found in Dr. Ellis's collection, and there are papers I could have done without, but I am certainly thankful for what I have got. It is particularly important that we should have access to papers on 'Gestalt' psychology for two reason's. In the first place the 'Gestalt' attitude has given rise to a great deal of fruitful research, as I have already said, and in the second place it is the only alternative to Associationism as a science of Psychology. Let us not quarrel about the meaning of the word 'science', and let us agree that when we operate with the concepts 'urges', 'desires ', ' motivating tendencies ', and the like, we are doing useful work, which</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 249 cannot yet be done without such concepts, whatever the 'scientific ' critics of psychology may say. For all that, we must also agree that the ideal we aim at is the complete determination of the one-after-another- ness in actual experience and actual behaviour. The associational linkage has broken down. ' Gestalt' psychology provides the only alternative so far. Therein lies its methodological and metaphysical importance. Petermann has dealt it some shrewd blows. He has pointed out that the attitude of the observer, when he looks at an ambiguous figure, makes a difference to what he will perceive, and that he can alter his attitude ' at will', whatever that may mean. And further, to say that a syllogism is a perfect configuration does not help us to bridge the gap between our thinking and that which we are thinking about-the odious well of Truth gapes at our feet. Can we ever do without the central perceiver, the knower, that awkward joker in the pack whose value is indeterminate ? On the answer to that question depends Psychology as a completely determined system. ' Gestalt' psychology is the best contemporary answer in the direction of determinism, and even if the answer is not completely satisfactory, even if we have to admit an indeterminate item, 'Gestalt' psychologists will have done, and will still do, great servicein calling our attention to aspects of human nature which we should otherwise miss. W. J. H. SPROTT. Guide to the Philosophy of Morals and Politics. By C. E. M. JOAD. London: VICTOR GOLLANcz, Ltd., 1938. Pp. 816. 6s. net. DR. JOAD has succeeded in writing a very good introduction to the philo- sophy of morals and politics. In spite of the enormous size of his book, he ends up apparently as fresh as he started, and throughout its length he argues and discusses indefatigably and with point. The plan of the book is to commence with an account of the moral and political theories of Plato and Aristotle by whom morals and politics were regarded as a single integral subject; to proceed to discuss ethics and politics separately for the period when to some extent they lost their unity; and to conclude with an account of some contemporary theories where a somewhat dubious unity has again been achieved. There is a chapter on free-will and de- terminism, and a chapter in which Dr. Joad gives a brief account of his own theory of ethics. Throughout the book the various theories are freely expounded, with the help of illustrations and analogies provided by Dr. Joad himself. Some attempt is made to discuss and assess all the theories that are presented. According to the theory of value which Dr. Joad himself supports, there is a first order value " which may be identical with what the theo- logians know as Deity " (p. 446); this is manifested in the form of the second order values of moral virtue, truth, beauty and happiness, of which the human mind possesses an innate knowledge; and these are in their turn manifested in particular persons and things. The recognition that particular things are valuable presupposes the prior recognition of universal values. There is no need to enter into the details of the theory except to mention that Dr. Joad argues in defence of the objectivity of evil and against the view that evil is merely absence of good. With regard to the theory as a whole, however, there are a number of comments to be made.</page><page sequence="14">250 NEW BOOKS. (i) Dr. Joad argues (p. 419) that the judgment that quinine is good for a cold (which he surprisingly holds to be " a genuine ethical judgment ") implies the existence of something that is ultimately valuable for its own sake. But that judgment only seems to imply that something is desired, not that it is good for its own sake. (ii) I suspect that there is sometimes some confusion in Dr. Joad's mind between a value and what has the value. At any rate, on the one hand, he speaks about values " manifest- ing themselves," and, on the other hand, he mentions " goods, or as I have called them, values " (p. 456). (iii) It is somewhat dangerous to bracket together moral virtue and beauty as ultimate values. For the arguments for the objectivity of beauty are so very much weaker than those for the objectivity of moral virtue. Furthermore, to call truth an ultimate value is somewhat puzzling. To be truthful, presumably, is to have a moral virtue; and to know true propositions may be often good, but on occasions bad. (iv) It would seem, therefore, that there is some danger in using the word " value " to cover so many different things. Furthermore, the use of the word in ethics tends to suggest a moral theory according to which moral action is the bringing into existence of things which are good in themselves. This theory scarcely does justice to the complexity of moral conduct. The title of this book and the course it pursues indicate that Dr. Joad deliberately intended to avoid discussion of problems belonging to the social sciences. It is hardly possible, however, to give an adequate account of political philosophy without touching upon sociological, economic and anthropological enquiries. For in order to decide how we ought to act in our political relationships it is necessary to acquire knowledge about the circumstances and possibilities of action. The researches of social scientists, therefore, are constantly of relevance to the enquiries of the political philosopher. If Dr. Joad had dealt with political philosophy in this way he would have considerably lengthened an already lengthy book. But his tendency to ignore the social sciences shows itself to some extent in his treatment of political writers. Locke he appreciates, and rightly, for his discussion of the moral justification of political authority. Hobbes, however (whom he wrongly considers to have written in defence of the Divine Right of Kings), he tends to depreciate, again rightly, for his inade- quate treatment of this same subject. But he scarcely does justice to Hobbes' brilliant analysis of those tendencies in human nature which make political association at the same time necessary and difficult. Similarly, little attention is given to Machiavelli's enquiries into the nature, acquisition and maintenance of political power. It is inevitable that a reviewer should find matters to disagree with in a work of this length, and it is natural that he should call attention to some of them. I add, therefore, that in virtue of its clarity of style, pertinacity in argument, and general accuracy of presentation, this book should prove of considerable use to students of moral and political philosophy. H. B. ACTON.</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 251 The Place of Value in a World of Facts. By WOLFGANG K6HLER (William James Lectures in Philosophy and Psychology, Harvard, 1934-35). New York: Liveright Publishing Corporation, 1938. Pp. 418, $3.75. THE subject-matter of this book was, in great part, different from what I expected or am competent to criticise. Much of it is physiological. The first chapter expresses in a lively way the complaints we so often hear, that both philosophy and modern science have failed the plain man in his need. They have nothing comfortable to tell him about the destiny of his race or about the reality of duty and of goodness. " Are these mere illusory ideas ? " he asks, and gets either no answer or the answer that reality is ' only ' matter in motion and ' values ' are ' only ' subjective ideas. The author prefers to substitute for the word value ' requiredness'. What we value in morals, in art, in organic life, perhaps even in lifeless nature, is what the context, the structure, the process demands. So much we observe within the ' phenomenological' world of direct experience. But the plain man asks whether to this phenomenal requiredness there is anything corresponding in the transcendent or hyperphenomenal world of objective reality. This hyperphenomenal rgality is identified with the subject-matter of science, though the author insists that it must in- clude macroscopical structures and processes as well as microscopical. It is then argued that this reality, as science has to think it, must have a structure at least analogous to the world of ordinary experience; otherwise we could never know in any degree what it is or even that it is. It is even claimed that between an element of present consciousness (phenomenal) and something outside consciousness (hyperphenomenal) there may be the relation of requiredness. The instances given are the effort to re- member a forgotten name, when we can reject wrong suggestions, and the rejection of a note or word as incongruous in a sequence whose earlier stages are no longer remembered. The next step in the argument seems highly arbitrary. It is that the hyperphenomenal term in such relations must be a cortical or neural 'trace'. There is said to be good ground for the hypothesis that the macroscopical structure and processes of the neuro-cortical material, when we are aware of phenomenological contexts containing requiredness, are analogous to the structures of those contexts. Can any more be said about these neuro-cortical analogons ? Can we say that they are structures and processes which imply 'direction' and 'hierarchy' ? Yes; it may be plausibly suggested that what in them corresponds to requiredness is 'force', somewhat as what corresponds to phenomenal 'givenness ' or fact is cause. " Requiredness and the forces of corresponding neural contexts are ' isomorphic '." " It is in- correct to say that 'causally determined facts in nature' and 'the opera- tion of forces within contexts' are two expressions for the same thing. There is a dualism in nature no less than in human experience." For instance, " We are justified in distinguishing between the actual distri- bution of neural visual facts as such and dynamic tendencies by which these processes react upon their own configuration ". " Just as an ' ought ' may remain what it is even though facts do not submit to it, so its counter- part in nature must point in an invariant direction, whether or not physical events take this course." In the last chapter Prof. K6hler faces the real question, whether the plain man, whose complaint against modern science was so vividly expressed in the first, will be satisfied with the news that in neuro-cortical structures</page><page sequence="16">252 NEW BOOKS. and processes, science may discover the presence of ' forces ' or ' tendencies' towards a certain modification of those structures and processes, though not always bringing it about, whenever he is conscious of duty or beauty or goodness. The answer given is that he will probably not be, so long as he shares the physicists' conceptions of nature and motion and matter. " The facts of nature have to be interpreted in a way that makes them compatible with our experience of psychological fact . . . We shall ask for such changes." The author only cites two philosophers as having made notable attempts to answer the question which engages him, Plato by his theory of Forms and Kant by his a priori principles of understanding. He thinks both failed. But it is remarkable that he does not consider the moral philosophy of either, where surely their answer should be looked for. Nor does he allude to the Critique of Judgment.
