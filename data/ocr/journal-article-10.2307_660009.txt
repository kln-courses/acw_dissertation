<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDICINE SONGS OF GEORGE FARMER1 BY ALBERT B. REAGAN WHILE doing research work among the Bois Fort Indians of Minnesota when I was Indian Agent at Nett Lake in that state one of my Indian policemen was a medicine man by the name of George Farmer Ne-ba-day-ke-shi-go-kay. He was a man of influence among his people. He also had a sufficient knowledge of his language, to be able to write down his thoughts in "Chippewa," though he had never been to any school so far as could be learned. Once when at his place I accidently discovered that he had a large note book. His little daughter gave it to me, and on opening it I saw writing in it, but in a language I did not recognize. After a good deal of persuasion, I succeeded in getting him to translate the words, when to my surprise I found that the writing consisted of medicine songs and medicinal receipts.2 These were written in Roman script but with phonetic values similar to French. Mr. Farmer let me copy his notes. The copy of his writing is in the first line and below this is the direct trans- lation of each word that is translatable. The words "to-o," "ho-wo-he," "we-he," and many others are just thrown-in words and do not admit of being translated. Stars indicate places where there are lengthy pauses in the song and dashes where short pauses occur. The word written "mite" is the same as the "mide," found elsewhere. 1 It should be noted that the orthography of the Indian words cited in this paper does not take into consideration phonetic niceties. Thus true lenes surd stops are not distinguished-from sonant stops, nor are 'p, 't, 'k from p, t, k respectively. It seems likely that terminally sonant stops are aspirated but have a corresponding surd as a glide. True sonant stops do not exist after sibilants; and it is not likely that true surds exist after the consonants n, fi, m. Possibly, to judge by the Gull Lake dialect, other peculiarities exist.-Truman Michelson. 2The medicinal receipts were published under the title "Some Chippewa Medicinal Receipts," in the American Anthropologist (N.s.), vol. 23, 1921, pp. 246-249. 332</page><page sequence="2">REAGAN] MEDICINE SONGS OF GEORGE FARMER 333 THE MEDICINE SONGS Song 1: As Written in George Farmer's Notebook KAGIWEIASH OGHGABEWI SI MI TEWIG Bemi keweinan shi madagwanina Mi kana misiwe bemi kaweian Mi-si-we o tenag babigotenag Ni bawiog mi mi gi himag kashi ka wit Mego nawag Ni ni wa ni bawida bebi nawag Ni te mosabebi nawog Wi-da ni-nee nish inini wog o nabiwog Edanabiian Ano djimo a ni gi wi newa ni kan Nani gedji no dji mo a qwi mo ki ia ne Ei nawemo iane anish mi te Nai ni ni wag nani hi teshg awag Ni-te-mo sa Sagi si i tig wi ko tig Ialiaama wanai temasa ki to bwa Kane ki to nagane Song 1: Kagiweiash Ochigabewisimitewig (0.

Be-mi-ka-we-i-nan shi-ma-da-gwa-ni-na I see a bear track or a track bear Explanation: The above is sung by those who are walking around inside of the Grand Medicine Lodge, and they go through the motions of looking for the bear track, dancing around the hall in a half stooped-over position. 2.

The big ducks [are soaring around]. They see the rocks all around the town. 3.

Ni-niwa nibawida be-binawag nitemosa be-bi-na-wag man standing up shoots the partner friend shoots shells shells Free translation: A man standing up [in the lodge] "shoots" the shells [into the heart] of my partner; [he] "shoots" the shells. (It might also mean: A man, standing up, "shoots" the shells. My friend "shoots" the shells.) 5. Widaninee nish ininiwag ona-biwag eda-na-bi-ie-an have lots of two men sit down bed things Free translation: Two men who have lots of things sit down on a bed or mat. 6.

(This stanza illustrates the action of the candidate, falling down when he is "shot" by the medicine man; the magic influence of the medicine bag being "shot" into his heart, and being too powerful for him to bear, he becomes unconscious. Such a scene as is here described can be seen at any medicine lodge dance. The person who falls down in a pretended unconsciousness is said to be sick.) 7.

Free translation: God is over the heaven and the earth. (It is hard to translate this. Na-na-mi-ga-mig is the "muskeg" (peat) in the swamps rising up out of the water, a sort of floating peat, the Indians believing that the land surface of the earth is a floating muskeg-"lots of islands on the surface of the big ocean." They base their belief on the fact that a piece of muskeg will tear loose from the bottom of the shallow lakes in that northern country and float around bearing upon it quite a bit of vegetation, even small trees. I have used such floating islands as concealments in the fall when hunting ducks on Nett Lake. I could hide among the rushes and sun- flower like weeds and, putting my decoys in the clear water adjacent, could shoot ducks from that concealment as they settled on the water among them; but I had to be careful lest my island sink under my weight and leave me in the water. Na-na-wa-ga-mig also means "all over the country are big</page><page sequence="5">336 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 24, 1922 islands," i.e., it is the earth (the middle of the universe). The Indians believe that the visible universe is composed of two plate-like parts; the sky is the upper "plate," the earth the lower "plate." They call the earth the lower middle of the universe, the sky the upper middle of the universe. They also believe that we live in the center of the upper (or land) part of the "earth-plate" and that the sky directly above us, "the visible sky," is the center of the "sky-plate." Nah-nah-we-ke-shig-oke is "the center of the "sky-plate.") 2. Bioina-bi-wake dji-gwe-wa-ge the thunderbird thunders Ki-ie-i-na bi-wake mo-ki-ia-ne look see the islands grow up [out of the water] 3. Na-na-wa-ga-mig we-dji-mo-ki-ia-ne from the middle of the sky we come down Free translation: From the center of the earth, the land surface of the earth, the big island grows up and from the center of the earth-plate we come up. From the middle of the sky-plate in the starry vault we come down. 4. A-we-na ke-wi-a-wage ki-bi-nan who uses medicine shells? A-we-na ke-wi-a-wa-ge dji-kwe-wa-ke who uses the thunder? 5.

Ni-kani-i-ho o (the head walker in the medicine dance, the leading man, the person who leads or heads the dancing column in the Grand Medicine Lodge dance cere- monies.) 6. Dji-bi-sa-sa-ga-dji-we a-da-ki-mi-to-ke the daylight comes upon the earth Ma-da-ni-kish-i-ko mi-na-to-ke sky God Free translation: The daylight in fringed rays comes upon the earth and when the sun gets a little higher the sky clears (i.e., darkness is gone, darkness goes when the sun gets brighter). 7. Na-no-de-ia-ko-we-wake wa-ke-e-da-shit there not much talking Mi-te-wa we-wi-ga-ni-ma-gwa medicine men our brethren Free translation: There is not much talking. The medicine men are our friends or brethren." (The whole stanza seems to mean: Every one is too tired from dancing to talk much; but all the medicine men are our friends.)</page><page sequence="6">REAGAN] MEDICINE SONGS OF GEORGE FARMER 337 8.

He then gets up and falls in line behind the man who "shot" him and pro- ceeds to "shoot" others. When white people are present, the actor who is "shot" does not usually fall down, but he always dodges as if trying to escape a blow from something, and then falls in line in the dance immediately follow- ing the one who "shot" him. 6.

Boni- iane (bone-iane) is used by these Indians much as we use the word "let"; but the sentence, "What would happen if I let three medicine lodges?" has no meaning. It would seem to mean, "What would happen if I went away from the three medicine lodges?" The next stanza seems to answer this. 9.

His mother's father (or some other rela- tive) then comes and lifts him up and he is prayed over. The five leading medicine men then take a smoke and the five plates of soup are set out for them. 6.

Song 23: By Tom Farmer-Wabeno Wagamon (Wabeno Song) Each of the following parts is sung over from two to ten times: 1.

Wa-sa wa-sa in-da-na-to-ma-a we-si far far want them to come animals Ke-ka-me-wa-go-ka-net be-sho be-sho with long legs a little way a little way Ni-do-o-to-ma me-got-te-wi-sit aw-e-si packing black animals 8. O-dji-da o-dji-da ni-mi-ga-wa a-we-si I can I can find animals Explanation: The parts of the song are explained as follows: 1. "My brother-in-law (the daylight) hears me. My brother-in-law (the daylight) sees me." The medicine men imagine that Daylight is a per- son and is listening to their supplications. 2."Floating ocean" means the water that surrounds the land; "floating turtle" means the land surface of the earth. The waters of the earth are believed to be flowing about on the upper side of the "earth-plate" mentioned above (see p. 336), and in this great sea is the land surface of the earth floating about like a huge turtle's back sticking above the water. The stanza means: "I see the floating ocean. I see the floating turtle" (that is, the land surface of the earth). The medicine man sees this in his mind's eye, in his imagination as he delves in song. These also hear him in his supplications, he believes. 3. "Coming hill, coming hill." This means that somebody (a manido) is coming up the hill. 4. "I use [it] the edge of the land, bad medicine" or, "bad medicine, I use it, edge of the land." A long time ago the Indians had a bad medicine man and bad medicine; and the medicine man is singing to keep this medicine man and his medicine off the edge of the earth. Freely rendered it would be "I use this (his medicine) to keep the bad medicine man and his medicine off of the edge of the earth." 5. "Big fire; bad fire." This means: "I see a big fire. I see a bad fire." The medicine man here refers to the blazing comet or meteor that crosses the sky. He may have seen the actual comet, or it may have been only a product of his imagination, but with the Indian, as with many white people, a comet is an omen of evil, and the Indian used "medicine" to keep it from harming the earth. 6. "I am shouting. I am looking." Here the medicine man is shouting and hallooing and looking to get the attention of the Wabeno manido (the god of the morning). He acts this out just like a person looking for some one who is lost. 7. "Far, far, want them to come, animals with long legs, a little way, packing black animals." Freely translated this is: "I want some [spiritual] animals to come from a long way off. [I want them also to be] black animals with packs on their backs." This is the prayer the medicine man is repeating</page><page sequence="33">364 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 24, 1922 to his manido after he has found him (in the 6th stanza). In the next stanza he finds the animals sought. 8. "I can, I can find black animals, black animals." That is, "I am able to find, I tell [you people], I am able to find the animals, the pack ani- mals [I prayed for]." The pack animals are the pack animals of the manido and are bringing presents to the people, trade articles, plenty of fish, plenty of serial crops and berries, plenty of fur, plenty of game, and increase of the human family.

Before leaving this subject, the writer believes he should add a word of explanation concerning the Bois Fort Ojibwa medicine</page><page sequence="35">366 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.S., 24, 1922 lodge or Grand Medicine Lodge (Society), so that the reader will get a clear idea of the meaning of the above songs. THE GRAND MEDICINE LODGE SOCIETY (MITAWIT, MIDEWI, OR MIDEWIWIN) The actors in this Grand Medicine order are mystery men (mide) or medicine men. Their profession is incantation, exorcism of demons, and the administration of shamanistic or magic reme- dies. As is indicated in the name, the order is an organized society. It is graded into four separate and distinct common degrees, and at Nett Lake four special degrees have been added, making eight in all. Both sexes are admitted to it. Admission to membership in the degrees is considered of great importance and consequently is difficult and is preceded and followed by elaborate ceremonies As a rule, a male candidate is one who has been selected for that distinction by the presiding medicine man at the "giving a name" or birth ceremonies of that respective person, the medicine man then assuming the office of god-father for the child. From that date on the parents of the boy gather presents to defray the ex- penses of his preliminary instruction by a selected medicine man when he reaches the age of puberty, to pay for the feasts given to all who attend the initiation ceremonies, and to furnish the re- quired presents to the medicine men on that occasion. Obtaining a degree often involves a candidate hopelessly in debt. Should he fail to liquidate the same, his relatives are expected to assume the responsibility thus incurred. The writer has known Bois Fort Indians to live in a starving condition for years, so that a member of the family could take one of these degrees. One aged, indigent woman at Pelican Point (Orr, Min- nesota), had saved (starved), it is said, for thirteen years so that she could take the fourth degree before she died, so great was her desire to become an acknowledged medicine woman. In this society, as maintained at Nett Lake, there are preserved the traditions relating to cosmogony and the genesis of mankind. It also teaches that an anthropomorphic deity appeared on earth in the long ago and interceded between Che-manido (Kitshi</page><page sequence="36">REAGAN] MEDICINE SONGS OF GEORGE FARMER 367 Manido) and the Indians. He taught the latter the means where- with they might provide themselves with the good things of earth and the power of warding off sickness and death. He gave to the Indians the various plants and instructed them in their uses. This being is known by the name of Manabush (Manibusr or Minabozo). The account of his life on earth, what he did for men, and the rites and ceremonies alleged to have been prescribed by him are dramatically rehearsed at the initiation of a candidate into the society. The society holds its services in a long, loose wigwam, called "medawegaun." Some of these are ten feet high, a hundred feet long, and twenty feet wide. The framework is complete, but the bark or canvas cover usually extends only half way up the sides, the top being open; sometimes the upper framework is also omitted. Along the center of this house, running the long way of the same within the framework, a pole, supported by posts, carries the presents the initiate is to give to the medicine chiefs. When dancing, they proceed in a continuous row from left to right around the center pole and its presents, giving them the appearance of dancing in two rows. They all carry animal skin medicine bags as they dance, and as they pass the initiate they shake these over him or at him uttering hoarse sounds of various kinds. Also, when setting out from the eastern or starting post in the eastern end of the lodge, each one utters a hoarse "Ho, ho, ho," or other gutteral expression as he shakes his medicine bag, holding it in both hands in front of him with its head pointing westward. Only members of the society are admitted, but any one who wishes may look on at the ceremony from without the hall. Four of the medicine men act as initiating officers. These are provided with drums and rattles. One of these also has a kona-pamik (or cowry) shell (Cyprae moneta), the sacred emblem of the Metawit (medicine lodge order), and as he shakes the rattle and sings in a gutteral voice he runs the lodge-dance course around the center pole, followed by the other medicine men. As they thus proceed they pass the novitiate who is seated on a new mat so as to face the center pole of the lodge. One after the other dances</page><page sequence="37">368 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.S., 24, 1922 about him (the novitiate) in turn, singing and gesticulating the initiation songs. As a final act they "shoot" him with the sacred konapamik shells, pretending to blow them into his head or breast, whereat he falls as if dead and lies in an apparently lifeless stupor. Quickly the medicine fraternity gather around him, manipulate and rub him with the medicine bags and pray and utter incantations over him till he "recovers," after which he spits a sacred shell from his mouth, pretending it is the one with which the medicine man had "shot" (or pretended to "shoot") him; but which he had previously concealed for the act in his mouth. As soon as he has spit up the shell, he sits upright and later, rising, is given a medicine bag as his lodge badge. This concludes the essentials of the ceremony. The distribution of the presents follows this act. The Nett Lake Indians also have a ghost society, which is a variation of the Grand Medicine Lodge, the ceremony being to all appearances about the same as that of the Grand Medicine Lodge proper. Should any person, who has been set apart by the medicine priest to be dedicated to the Medicine lodge, die before the time set for the initiation, provided he is an adult, the relatives announce the fact to the chief medicine men at a specially called meeting (feast) at the lodge of one of the mourners. After the proper preparation thereafter, the chief mourner is initiated into the society as a substitute for the deceased, and the feast he gives is the "feast of the dead." The whole ceremony, including the feast, is designed to release the deceased's "shadow" from the "shades" and permit it to depart to the "land of mysteries in the happy hunting ground." After the death of twenty-two infants from cholera infantum in the fall of 1913, we had a ghost ceremony almost weekly till I left the region the next year. Also, since the infantile mortality has increased, children are initiated into the society either in person or by proxy. Another case of initiation by proxy is when a sick youth is brought to the ceremonial structure for restoration to health as a last resort, all the other and ordinary efforts of the shamans to</page><page sequence="38">REAGAN] MEDICINE SONGS OF GEORGE FARMER 369 cure the patient with exorcisms and incantations having proved futile. Sessions of the society are also held for the sole'purpose of curing the sick. This mode of doctoring is, in fact, becoming more popular every year. KAYENTA, ARIZONA</page></plain_text>
