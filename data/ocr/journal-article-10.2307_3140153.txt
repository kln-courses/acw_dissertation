It is a matter of prime necessity for every Christian to know upon what foundation to base his faith. To do this intelligently he must be able to understand the basis upon which Christ himself founded the faith of his disciples. It might be thought that Christ, in order to convince his disciples of the truth of that which he taught, would appeal to the evidences of logical argu- mentation and thought. It is not so long ago when Christians did think that this was the correct method. But such was not the purpose of Christ. He did not enter the ranks of the philosophers. True it is that he made use of reason and argument. He fought his opponents by this method; he taught with wisdom his disciples. But he never attempted to demonstrate the truth- fulness of his teachings by the necessary laws or sequence of thought. Had he tried to establish his kingdom by such processes, the bitter and iron- ical question of Pilate, What is truth ? would have been in place. Then it might be thought that Christ appealed to some written or personal authority in confirmation of his message. Many today yet think that the mere appeal to the authority of the Scriptures ends all controversy and establishes the truth of a position beyond a doubt, and claim that this method of found- ing one's faith has been learned from Christ's "It is written." However Christ did not attempt such a basis. Had he done so he would have taken the standpoint occupied by the Pharisees and the priests of the Jewish people. These, in truth, built up all their claims on the infallible authority of the written Word. But Christ stood on a better foundation. He regarded it as a matter of little importance to disregard customs of venerable antiquity. He opposed views hoary with age. In the Sermon on the Mount he opposes to the permission of a divorce, accorded in certain cases by Moses to the people, his own " But I say unto you." And he calls this treatment of the law not a breaking but a fulfilment, just as surely as a release from the imperfect conditions in the case of the divine law is a fulfilment of its real contents. It is true that Christ appealed to the Scriptures in defense of his own person. He refuted his opponents with the crude weapons (groben Waffen) which they themselves employed. He shows them that he could with as good a right as they appeal to the authority of the written Word. He showed them that better than they he had looked into the real spirit of the 245</page><page sequence="2">246 THE BIBLICAL WORLD law and had learned to understand its fundamental ideas. They were com- pelled to feel that the spirit of freedom in which he walked was not in con- tradiction with Moses and the prophets. But the claim that he was the Messiah and that he taught the truth, he did not base on an appeal to the authority of the Scriptures. Nor did he do this on the authority of his own person. He says that his doctrine is not his own. He does not ask people to believe him because he says so, but because what he says is the truth. It is not he who shall judge them, but the words of truth themselves will judge them on the last day. He did not appeal to his personal authority, or he could not have said: " If I say the truth, why do ye not believe me ?" Christ demands faith on the part of his hearers because he speaks the truth. He tells them that he came into the world that he might testify of the truth. He has come to reveal to the world the eternal truth, the existence and being of God in their perfection. He lays claim to the faith of his hear- ers because he knows that he is really giving them a revelation, something that had never before been known. He knows himself to be the perfect reve- lation of God. Truth, i. e., reality ( Wirklichkeit), was at all times the same, but men did not always know it. The laws of nature have been operative in the same order of things from the beginning, but they were not always understood. Only gradually did man's mind begin to fathom their philosophy and order. Only gradually did nature reveal her secrets to the investigations of the human race. So also, there is but one absolute moral law. The spirit and power of this law has for thousands of years blessed those who have sub- mitted to its order, and punished those who resisted, although the innermost character of this law was not appreciated. Only gradually has mankind been able to understand this high system and to apply its principles. Christ, the revealer of the divine will, has removed the last veil that covered and concealed it. Religious truth, too, was always the same, for God is the same from eternity to eternity. But men did not know the truth. God was not far distant from each one of them and did not leave them without witness by which they could feel and find him. But their eyes were almost entirely blinded and their ungrateful and stupid hearts darkened the light of truth. Some truths they could discover, but the connection of truth they could not. Individual notes they could hear, but not the harmony and melody. Christ it was who revealed to us ethical and religious truth. He was in possession of the organ to see what had always been present and to see it as it was. His soul was the mirror in which God's image was reflected for us. His words are true because they correspond exactly with eternal reality. His spirit agrees throughout with the Father, as the sun dial does with the sun. Where we have no eyes to see and no ears to hear, he saw the finger of the Father and heard the voice of the Father. Man cannot create truth, he can only say what he has heard. But the only begotten Son who has been in the</page><page sequence="3">SYNOPSES OF IIPOR7ANT ARTICLES 247 bosom of the Father has revealed us the truth. He possessed the Mes- sianic power to understand the mind of the Father and to reveal his being. His walk and conversation, his whole life, were a revelation of the Father. Whosoever saw him saw also the Father, because his whole existence was nothing but an imitation of the Father, a picture of the Father. The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do. The absence of worry, which he enjoins upon his disciples, he has himself learned from the Father. The love of one's enemies, which he commands, he has learned from the Father. He bases his violation of the Sabbath observance of the Jews on the ground that his Father worketh hitherto, and hence he, too, is entitled to work. In demanding faith on the part of his hearers he does so for no other reason than that he knows the truth, because he testifies of that which he has seen and heard. The philosopher adduces that which is the result of his processes of thought; Christ draws from the original fountain. He sees the truth and does nothing else but give it utterance. We do not demand proofs for that which we have seen and heard. In the very seeing and hearing lie the evidences of reality. Therefore the Christ does not bring any further evidence for that which he has learned to know. He does nothing but tes- tify of this. Christ reveals God to us.. He testifies of eternal truth. In revealing these he furnishes a foundation for his disciples' faith. His words, his walk, his life, his death, show the being of God. Whosoever sees him sees a new light. But this does not suffice. The disciple must not only have light; he must also have an eye. For the blind even light is darkness. Christ appeals to a sense for the truth which he already finds in the dis- ciples. He appeals to their moral feeling. He presupposes in them ethical experiences and he here connects his teachings. Whenever he could not presuppose such an echo, as in the case of Herod, he finds it useless to speak and is silent. Nothing brings the moral sense cf man to a complete awaken- ing except the person of Christ. The appearance of Christ makes such a powerful impression that man cannot remain unmoved. Conscience is aroused and becomes an accuser. This wonderful impression of the person of Christ is a gift of God. Under the influence of him who has revealed the truth, the truth itself begins to speak to man. The spirit of God becomes active in him. The immediate influence of eternal reality overwhelms him, although this influence can be resisted, as is shown in the case of the Pharisees. In this way even yet Christ establishes faith in the believer. Not arguments of reason, not miracles and signs do this, but the revelation of the Father, as this appears in his wonderful person, is the means through which the hearts of men are opened to faith. This article has representative as well as individual value It is an expression of the positive dogmatical teaching of the newer school with reference to the foundation of faith, particularly as voiced by the influential Ritschl school in Germany. The newness and suggestiveness of the line of thought cannot be otherwise than stimulat- ing, especially in suggesting other inquiries. G. H.

The preprophetic period extends from Moses to Elijah, four centuries(1300- 900 B.C.), embracing the boyhood and the youth of the nation, crude yet promising. (I) The literature of the period is not represented by any book preserved to us. There are books belonging to this period mentioned in J and E, the prophetic writers of the eighth and seventh centuries. These are the Book of Heroes and the Book of the Wars of Yahweh. A third work is mentioned by the Septuagint. Pieces of poetry like the Lamech Song or the Well Song may have belonged to these or other collections. All were poet- ical. It is probable that J and E are the first biblical prose writers. We have also the Lament over Saul and Jonathan and the Song of Deborah, which are the two chief memorials of the period. They show the germ of noble thought, but undeveloped. The real history of Hebrew literature begins after David and Solomon, the Old Testament itself being witness. Hence whether the Israelites of this period had and employed the art of writing, though archaeologically interesting, is religiously of minor importance. The rise of literary composition seems to have been synchronous with that of prophecy. (2) The ritual of religious worship was simple. A small stone or pillar or a rude altar on a high hill or under a green tree, offerings at stated seasons, partaken of by priest and god and people alike, was the rule. In time all became more elaborate. The sacerdotal organization was vague. For some time there seems to have been no generally recognized priestly clan. Though Levites seem at an early time to be preferred, yet they have no stable position. David was the first great religious organizer; his work was con- tinued by Solomon. (3) The object of worship was Yahweh, brought into Canaan by the Hebrews. They never acknowledged any other god as their national deity. Their idea of God was the same as that of the peoples around them,--his sphere practically unlimited within his community. The conquer- ing Israelites bringing their God into the land of Baal found it necessary to pay honor to the local deity. The two orders of worship were fused. The mind of the Israelite of that time found no incongruity in recognizing the local god alongside his own ancestral deity. But as the nation grew in political stability and intellectual clearness this attitude became more and more difficult. This new Yahweh-Baal religion found its religious observ- ances in the Canaanitish agricultural festivals and forms of worship, back of which lay many primitive ideas and usages, as tree worship (ashera), sacred waters, sacred stones, a possible totemism seen in the survivals of beast wor- ship, a possible ancestral worship (terairimn). The folk religion finds an interesting example in the angel who is either the faded figure of an old deity or an original appearance of Yahweh whose crude anthropomorphism was thus softened by a later age. Magic lingered, but its legitimate use was past. Divination is seen in Samuel, who is also the primitive prophet and the one</page><page sequence="5">SYNOPSES OF IMfPORTANT ARTICLES 249 who filled this word with a new meaning. There is no well-attested example of human sacrifice in this time. The future life is only once or twice referred to. (4) The most important fact in the religious organization was the tenacity with which they held to Yahweh as the national deity. All the good features of other gods were absorbed into him. His character in this period was not exalted. He reflected the ethical crudeness of the age, yet he was the center and soul of social unity. It was no theoretic idea that appeared at this time. Certain passages which look that way are of a later age. This adhesion to Yahweh has the germ of future greatness which is visible in the crude religion of the preprophetic times. This is a thoroughgoing presentation of the religion of Israel from the radical point of view based upon criticism of the materials. Such articles are helpful when written, as is this one, from fullness of knowledge and objectively. It must be con- fessed that there is no really satisfying explanation of the power and influence which later Israelitish religion showed. Its germs do not seem to be here. There are refer- ences to the "peculiar genius " of the Israelites, etc., by which it seems that the writer would have us understand that he recognizes something unique in this people. G. S.
