<plain_text><page sequence="1">Being Odd, Getting Even: Threats To Individuality by Stanley Cavell In the lobby of William James Hall at Harvard, across the story-tall expanse of concrete above the bank of elevators facing you as you enter, brass letters are inset to spell out the following pair of sentences, attributed by further such letters to William James: The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual, The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community. The message may be taken as empirically directed to whoever stands beneath and reads it, and thence either as a warning, or an exhortation, or a description of a state of current affairs; or else it may be taken as claiming a transcendental relation among the concepts of community and individual as they have so far shown themselves. Does this multiplicity produce what certain literary theorists now speak of as the undecidable? Or is the brass indiffer- ence of this writing on the wall an apt expression of our avoidance of decision, a refusal to apply our words to ourselves, to take them on? I regard what I propose to say here as a kind of progress report on my philosophical journey to locate an inheritance of Wittgen- stein and Heidegger, and before them of Emerson and Thoreau, for all of whom there seems to be some question whether the</page><page sequence="2">98 STANLEY CAVELL individual or the community as yet, or any longer, exist. This question, or you may say fantasy, gives ground equally for despair or for hope in the human as it stands. It is also the question or fantasy in which I have been seeking instruction from certain Hollywood comedies of remarriage and, before them, from Shake- spearean romance and tragedy. This mood of investigation and reception is not one in which I wish to propose a solution to the riddle whether society is the bane or the blessing of the individual, or to offer advice as to whether a better state of the world must begin with a reformation of institutions or of persons, advice which would of course require definitions of institutions and of individu- als and of their modes of interpénétration. So I will pick up the twist in the story of the discovery of the individual where Descartes placed it in his Meditations, before so to speak either individual or institutional differences come into play; namely in Descartes's dis- covery that my existence requires, hence permits, proof, you may say authentication - more particularly, requires that if I am to exist I must name my existence, I would like to say acknowledge it, an imperative than entails that I am a thing with two foci to it, or in Emerson's image, two magnetic poles, say a positive and a nega- tive, or say an active and a passive. Such a depiction may not seem to you right off to capture Descartes's Cogito argument. But that something like it does cap- ture that argument is what I understand the drift of Emerson's perhaps inaudibly famous essay "Self-Reliance" to claim. My first task here will be to establish this fact of Emerson's essay; my second will be to say why I think Emerson is right in his interpreta- tion of Descartes, as right in his inheritance of Descartes as any other philosophical descendant I know of. Following that, as a third principal task, I take up a pair of tales of Edgar Allen Poe's, primarily "The Imp of the Perverse" and subordinately the more famous "The Black Cat," which I find engaged with the same imperative of human existence, that it must prove, or say declare itself. And since Poe's "The Imp of the Perverse" alludes more than once to Hamlet, there should appear a moment in which to account for the fact that in having to produce last summer a title for this paper, before I knew precisely what I would want to to say, I chose the idea of thinking about individuality (or the loss of it) under the spell of revenge, of getting even for oddness.</page><page sequence="3">Being Odd, Getting Even 99 Emerson's incorporation of Descartes into ' 'Self-Reliance," or anyway his allusion to the so-called Cogito argument, is any- thing but veiled. At the center of the essay there is a paragraph that begins as follows: "Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage." It is my impression that readers of Emerson have not been impressed by this allusion, or repetition, perhaps because they have fallen into an old habit of condescending to Emerson, as if to pay for a love of his writing by conceding that he was hardly capable of consecutive thought, let alone capable of taking on Descartes; and perhaps because they remember or assume the Cogito always to be expressed by words which translate as "I think, therefore I am." But this is not its appearance in what I suppose is the place it is most often actually encountered in Descartes's writing, that is in his Second Meditation. There the insight is expressed as follows: "I am, I exist, is necessarily true every time that I pronounce it or conceive it in my mind." On this expression of the Cogito, Emer- son's emphasis on the saying of "I" is precisely faithful to Des- cartes's insight. It is this feature of the Cogito that is emphasized in some of the most productive thinking about Descartes in recent analytical philosophy, where the issue, associated with the names of Jaako Hintikka and Bernard Williams, is phrased as the question whether the certainty of existence required and claimed by the Cogito, results from taking the claim "I think" as the basis (i.e., premise) for an inference, or as the expression of some kind of perform- ance^ Williams does not quite rest with saying, with Hintikka, that the Cogito just is not an inference, and just is a performance of some kind, but Williams does insist that it is not an ordinary, or say syllogistic inference; as he insists, at the end of his intricate discus- sion, that the performance in play is no less peculiar of its own kind, demanding further reflection. Its peculiarity can be summa- rized as follows. On the one hand, the force of the first person pronoun just is that when it is used it cannot fail to refer to the one using it, hence in particular one who says "I exist" must exist; or, 1. Jaakko Hintinkka, "Cogito, Ergo Sum: Inference or Performance?"; Bernard Williams, "The Certainty of the Cogito"; both reprinted in Willis Doney, Descartes (Garden City, New York, 1967), pp. 108-139, pp. 88-107.</page><page sequence="4">100 STANLEY CA VELL put negatively, "I exist" is undeniable, which is to say, "I do not exist" cannot coherently be said. On the other hand, for "I" to be said sensibly it must distinguish the one saying it, to whom it cannot fail to refer, from others to whom it does not, on that saying, refer. But Descartes' use of it arises exactly in a context in which there are no others to distinguish himself (so to speak) from. So the force of the pronoun is in apparent conflict with its sense. Compared with such considerations Emerson's remark about our not daring to say "I think," "I am," seems to be somewhat literary. But why? Emerson is picking up a question, or a side of the question, that succeeds the inferential or performance aspect of the Cogito, namely the question as to what happens if I do not say (and of course do not say the negation of) "I am, I exist," or "conceive it in my mind." An analytical philosopher will hardly take much interest in this side of the question since it will hardly seem to such a one worth arguing for or against the inference that if I do not say or perform the words "I am," or their equivalent (aloud or silently), that therefore I perhaps do not exist. Surely the saying or thinking of some words may be taken to determine whether the sayer or thinker of them exists at most in the sense of determining whether he or she knows of his or her existence, but surely not in the sense that the saying or thinking may create that existence. But it seems that this assurance is contrary to Descartes's findings. For he speculates a few paragraphs after announcing the Cogito: "I am, I exist- that is certain; but for how long do I exist? For as long as I think; for it might perhaps happen, if I totally ceased thinking, that I would at the same time completely cease to be." This does not quite say that my ceasing to think would cause, or would be, my ceasing to exist. It may amount to saying so if I must think of myself as having a creator (hence, according to Descartes, a preserver), and if all candidates for this role other than myself dropped out. And these assumptions I find faithful to Descartes's text, so that I am prepared to take it that the cogito is only half the battle concerning the relation of my thinking to my existing, or perhaps that "I think, therefore I am" expresses only half the battle of the Cogito: for Descartes establishes to his satis- faction that I exist only while, or if and only if, I think. It is this, it</page><page sequence="5">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 0 1 seems, which leads him to claim that the mind always thinks, an idea that Nietzsche and Freud will put to further use. Emerson, in these terms, goes the whole way with Descartes's insight, that I exist only if I think, but he thereupon denies that I (mostly) do think, that the "I" mostly gets into my thinking, as it were. From which it follows that the skeptical possibility is real- ized, that I do not exist, that I as it were haunt the world, a realization perhaps expressed by saying that the life I live is the life of skepticism. Just before the end of the Second Meditation, Des- cartes observes that "if I judge that (anything, say the external world) exists because I see it, certainly it follows much more evi- dently that I exist myself because I see it." So the existence of the world is more doubtful than my own existence, hence if I do not know that I exist I so to speak even more evidently do not know that the things of the world exist. If, accordingly, Emerson is to be understood as describing the life left to me under skepticism, implying that I do not exist among the things of the world, that I haunt the world, then if for this reason he will be called literary and not philosophical, we might well conclude from this charge: so much the worse for philosophy. Philosophy shrinks before a description of the very possibility it undertakes to refute, so it can never know of itself whether it has turned its nemesis aside. But it seems to me that one can see how Emerson arrives at his conclusion by a continuing faithfulness to Descartes's own proce- dures, to the fact, as one might put it, that Descartes's procedures are as essentially literary as they are philosophical, that it may even have become essential to philosophy to show as much. What I have in mind is this. After arriving at the Cogito, Descartes immediately raises the question of his metaphysical identity: "But I do not yet know sufficiently clearly what I am, I who am sure that I exist." He asks this question about what he is explicitly six or seven times over the ensuing seven or eight paragraphs, along the way rejecting such answers as that he is a rational animal, or that he is a body, or that his soul is "something very rarefied and subtle, such as a wind, a flame, or a very much expanded air. . .infused throughout my grosser components," before settling on the answer that he is essentially nothing more or less than a thing that thinks. There is nothing in these considerations to call argument or inference, and</page><page sequence="6">1 02 STANLEY CAVELL indeed the most obvious description of these passages is that they constitute an autobiographical narrative of some kind.2 If Des- cartes is philosophizing, and if these passages are essential to his philosophizing, it follows that philosophy is not exhausted in argu- mentation. And if the power of these passages is literary, then the literary is essential to the power of philosophy; at some stage the philosophical becomes, or turns into, the literary. Now I think one can describe Emerson's progress as having posed Descartes's question for himself, concerning what it is that I am, and provided a fresh line of answer to it, you might call it a grammatical answer: I am a being who to exist must say I exist, or (as I have sometimes put roughly the same matter) I must acknowl- edge my existence, claim it, stake it, enact it. The beauty of the answer lies in its weakness, you may say its emptiness, indeed in two weaknesses: first, it does not prejudge what the I or self or mind or soul may turn out to be, but only specifies a condition that whatever it is must meet; second, the proof only works in the moment of its giving, for what I prove is the existence only of a crature who can enact its existence, as exemplified in actually giving the proof, not one who at all times does in fact enact it. The transience of the existence it proves, and the transience of its manner of proof, seems to me further in the spirit of the Meditations, including its proofs for God; it would be the moral of Descartes's insistence on the presence of clear and distinct ideas as essential to, let me say, philosophical knowledge. Only in the vanishing presence of the state of such ideas does proof take effect - as if there is nothing to rely on but reliance itself. This is perhaps why Emerson will say, "To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking." That what I am is one who to exist enacts his existence, is an answer Descartes might almost have given himself, since it is scarcely more than a literal transcript of what I called the further half of the Cogito. It is a way of envisioning roughly the view of so- called human existence taken by Heidegger in Being and Time, that 2. This description of the Meditations takes up a piece of unfinished business broached in 'The Avoidance of Love: A Reading of King Lear1* in Must We Mean What We Say? (New York, 1969; reprinted Cambridge, England, 1976), p. 336.</page><page sequence="7">Being Odd, Getting Even 103 Dasein's being is such that its being is an issue for it. But for Descartes to have given such an answer would have threatened the first declared purpose of his Meditations, which was to offer proof of God's existence. If I am one who can enact my existence, God's role in the enactment is compromised. Descartes's word for what I call "enacting" here - or claiming or staking or acknowledging - Descartes's word is authoring. In the third Meditation: . . .1 wish to pass on now to consider whether I myself , who have the idea of God, could exist if there had been no God. And I ask, from what source would I have derived my existence? Possibly from myself, or from my parents. . .But if I were. . .the author of my own being, I would doubt nothing, I would experience no desires, and finally I would lack no perfection. . .1 would be God (himself). . .Even if I could suppose that possibly I have always been as I am now. . .it would not follow that no author of my existence need then be sought and I would still have to recognize that it is necessary that God is the author of my existence. Apparently it is the very sense of my need for a human proof of my human existence - some authentication - that is the source of the idea that I need an author. ("Need for proof" will be what becomes of my intuition of my transience, or dependence, or incompleteness, or unfinishedness, or unsponsoredness; of the intuition, perhaps I can say, that I am unauthorized.) But surely the idea of self-authorizing is merely metaphorical, the merest exploitation of the coincidence that the Latin word for author is also the word for creating, nothing more than the by now fully discredited Romantic picture of the author or artist as incom- prehensibly original, as world-creating and self-creating genius. What is true is that the problematic of enacting one's existence skirts the edge of metaphysical nonsense. It asks us, in effect, to move from the consideration that we may sensibly disclaim certain actions as ours (ones done, as we may say, against our wills); and (hence) to move from the consideration that we may disclaim certain of our thoughts as ours (ones, it may be, we would not dream of acting on, though the terrain here gets philosophically</page><page sequence="8">1 04 STANLEY CA VELL and psychologically more dangerous); to the possibility that none of my actions and thoughts are mine, as if, if I am not a ghost, I am, I would like to say, worked, from inside or outside. This is a move to the metaphysical like that from considering that since it makes sense to suppose that I might lack any or all of, let us say, my limbs, that I might lack a body altogether; or from saying that since I never see all of any object and hence may not know that a given object exists, that therefore I may not know that the external world as such exists. Ordinary language philosophy, most notably in the teaching of J.L. Austin and of Wittgenstein, certainly has discredited such moves to the metaphysical, as a way of discrediting the conclusions of skepticism. But on my interpretation of Wittgen- stein, what is discredited is not the appeal or the threat of skepti- cism as such, but only skepticism's own pictures of its accomplish- ments. In the same way I think what is discredited in the Romantic's knowledge about self-authoring is only a partial, say Romanticized, picture of authoring and of creation, a picture of human creation as a literalized anthropomorphism of God's crea- tion-as if to create myself I were required to begin with forming the dust of the ground and with magic breath, rather than with, say, an uncreated human being and the power of thinking. That human clay and the human capacity for thought are enough to inspire the authoring of myself is, at any rate, what I take Emerson's "Self-Reliance," as a reading of Descartes's Cogito argument, to claim. I take his underlying turning of Des- cartes to be something like this, that there is a sense of being the author of himself, is a continuing task not a property; a task in (that may just be the name of the particular picture of the self as a self-present substance); a sense in which the absence of doubt and desire of which Descartes speaks in proving that God, not he, is the author of himself, is a continuing task not a property; a task in which the goal, or the product of the process, is not a state of being but a moment of change, say of becoming, a transience of being, a being of transience. (Emerson notes: "This one fact the world hates; that the soul becomes.99) To make sense of this turn, Emer- son needs a view of the world, let us say a perspective on its fallenness, in which the uncreatedness of the individual manifests itself, in which human life appears as the individual's failure at self- creation, call this his or her continuous loss of individual possibility</page><page sequence="9">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 05 in the face of some over-powering competitor. Which is as much as to say that if my gloss of Emerson's reading of Descartes is right then the need of the Cogito shows itself to arise at a particular historical moment (in the life of the individual and in the life of his/ her culture). Emerson calls this mode of (uncreated) life "conformity". But each of the modern prophets seems to have been driven to charac- terize, to find some way of characterizing, the threat to individual existence, to individuality, posed by the life to which their society is bringing itself. John Stuart Mill called it the despotism of opinion, and his typical characterization of being human in his period is in terms of its deformity; he speaks of us as withered and starved, and as dwarfs. Nietzsche called the threat the world of the last man, of the murderers of God. Marx thinks of it rather as the pre-existence of the human. Freud's discovery of the uncomprehended meaning- fulness of human expressions should be seen as belonging in the line of such prophecy. Emerson's philosophical distinction on this ground lies in his diagnosis of this stage and in his recommended therapy. It is as a diagnosis of this state of the world that I am taking Emerson to have announced that Descartes' s proof of self-exist- ence (the foundation, Descartes named it, of the edifice of his former opinions, the fixed and immoveable fulcrum on which to re- position the earth) cannot, or can no longer, be given; and to ask us to conclude (such is the nature of this peculiar proof) that man, the human, does not, or does no longer, exist. Here is Emerson's sentence again, together with the sentence and a half following it: Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say *I think', 'I am', but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. . .they are for what they are; they exist with God today. Emerson's proposed therapy in this vision of so-called man's loss of existence is sketched out if we take the successive notations of the vision as in apposition, interpretations of one another: being apologetic; being no longer upright; daring not to say, but only quoting; being ashamed, as if for not existing today. There are, as</page><page sequence="10">1 06 STANLEY C A VELL Wittgenstein is once moved to express himself, a multitude of well- known paths leading off from these words in all directions. Let us take, or at least point down two or three such paths. To begin with, the idea that there is something about our mode of existence that removes us from nature, and that this has to do with being ashamed, of course alludes to the Romantic problem- atic, or the post-Kantian interpretation of that problematic, of self- consciousness, a particular interpretation of the fall of man. But put Emerson's invocation of shame in apposition to his invocation of our loss of uprightness, and he may be taken as challenging, not passing on, the Romanticized interpretation of the fall as self- consciousness, refusing to regard our shame as a metaphysically irrecoverable loss of innocence but seeing it instead as an unneces- sary acquiescence (or necessary only as history is necessary) in, let me say, poor posture, a posture he calls timidity and apologetic- ness. I will simply claim, without now citing textual evidence for it (preeminently the contexts in which the word "shame" and its inflections are deployed throughout Emerson's essay) that the pro- posed therapy in these terms is to have us become ashamed of our shame, to find our ashamed posture more shameful than anything it could be taken in reaction to. One might say that he calls for more, not less, self-consciousness; but it is better to say that he shows self-consciousness not to be the issue it seems. It is, I mean our view of it is, itself a function of poor posture. But really everything so far said about existence, and pré- existence, etc., may be some function of poor posture, of course including our view of what poor posture may be. Bad posture Emerson variously names, in one passage, as peeping or stealing or skulking up and down "with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper in the world which exists for him"; and in another he finds us behaving as if our acts were fines.we paid "in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade", done "as an apology or extenu- ation of (our) living in the world - as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances." This vision of human beings as in postures of perpetual penance, or self-mortification, will remind readers of Waiden of that book's opening pages. Good posture has two principal names or modes in "Self- Reliance"; it is called standing and called sitting. The idea produc-</page><page sequence="11">Being Odd, Getting Even 107 ing both modes is that of finding and taking and staying in a place. What is good in these postures is whatever makes them necessary to the acknowledgment, or the assumption, of individual existence, which is to say, to the capacity to say "I." That this takes daring is what standing (up) pictures; that it takes claiming what belongs to you and disclaiming what does not belong to you, is what sitting pictures, which is hence the posture of being at home in the world (not peeping, stealing, skulking, or, as he also says, leaning), hence of owning or taking possession. This portrayal of the posture of sitting is, again, to be found drawn out in Waiden, where what its writer thinks of as acquiring property is what most people would consider as passing it by. Resisting now the temptation to follow the turnings of these paths, I put them at once in apposition to the notation that in not daring to say something what we do instead is to quote. There is a gag here that especially appeals to our contemporary sensibilities. Recall once more Emerson's words: "Man dares not say. . .but quotes." But since Emerson at that moment quotes Descartes, isn't he confessing that he too cannot say but can only quote? Then should we conclude that he is here taking back or dismantling (or something) the entire guiding idea of "Self-Reli- ance"? Or is he perhaps rather suggesting that we are to overcome the binary opposition between saying and quoting, recognizing that each is always both, or that the difference is undecidable? But since the difference seems to me roughly the difference between what Thoreau calls the mother tongue and the father tongue, hence perhaps makes the difference between language and literariness, and since I am taking the difference between saying and quoting as one of posture, the proposal of undecidability strikes me as the taking of a posture, and a poor one. I imagine being told that the difference in posture partakes of the same undecidability. My reply is that you can decide to say so. My decision is otherwise. (I expect it is helped by my intuition that a guiding remark of Freud's, taking Freud as from among the nineteenth-century prophets, is translat- able this way: Where thought takes place in me, there shall I take myself.) Emerson's gag, suggesting that saying is quoting, condenses a number of ideas. It calls attention to the fact that language is an inheritance, words are therefore before I am, they are common;</page><page sequence="12">108 STANLEY CA VELL second, that whether I am saying them or quoting them, as it were saying them first- or second-hand, which means whether I am thinking or imitating, is the same as the question whether I do or do not exist as a human being, a matter demanding proof; third, that the writing, of which the gag is part, is an expression of the proof of saying "I," hence of the claim that writing is a matter, say the decision, of life and death, and that what this comes to is the inheriting of language, an owning of words, which does not remove them from circulation, but rather returns them, as to life. That the claim to existence requires returning words to lan- guage, as if making them common to us, is what is suggested to me by the fourth sentence of "Self-Reliance": "To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,- that is genius." (Here the path I am bearing not to take from these words is that of the transformation of the Romantics' idea of genius. Genius is now not a special endowment, as of virtuosity, but a stance toward whatever endowment you discover is yours, as if life itself were a gift, and remarkable.) Genius is accordingly the name of the promise that the private and the social will be achieved together, hence of the perception that our lives now take place in the absence of either. It is thus the dedication of his writing to that promise when he says: "I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim" (I will not repeat what I have said elsewhere concerning Emerson's marking of Whim in the place of God, thus staking his writing as a whole as having the power to turn aside the angel of death.) The point I emphasize here is only that the life-giving power of words, of saying "I," is your readiness to subject your desire to words (call it Whim), to become intelligible, with no assurance that you will be taken up. ("I hope it may be better than Whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation.") It is a fantasy of finding your own voice. It may make others angry and they will shun you, even some mothers and fathers will. That this dedication enacts a posture, or response, to language as such, as if words as a whole cry out for redemption, is how I understand his saying: ". . .conformity makes (men) not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. . .so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set</page><page sequence="13">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 09 them right." The citing of authorship here as the office of all users of language, a thing as commonly distributed as genius, is the plain- est justification for appealing to the enactment or acknowledgment of one's existence as the authoring of it, and in particular the justification for what we may take as Emerson's dominating claims for his writing, first that it proves his human existence, i.e., estab- lishes his right to say " I," to tell himself from (hence to) others, second that what he has proven on his behalf others are exactly capable of proving on theirs. These claims come together in such a statement as: "I will stand for humanity," which we will recognize as marking a number of paths- that his writing is in an upright posture; that what it says represents the human, meaning that his portrait of himself is accu- rate only insofar as it portrays his fellows, and meaning that he is writing on their behalf, if not exactly at their bidding then at any rate with their interests in mind; and that he will for the time being stand humanity, bear it, as it is; and that he will stand up for it, protect it, guard it, presumably against itself. But to protect and guard someone, by writing to and for that same one, is a meaning of providing instruction, tuition. The path I am not taking at this point leads from Emerson's speaking of "primary wisdom as Intuition," adding that "all later teachings are tuitions." I note this path in order to commemorate the annoyance I have felt on having to stand the repeated, con- forming description of Emerson as a philosopher of intuition, a description that uniformly fails to add that he is simultaneously the teacher of tuition. They speak of him as though his speaking of all later teachings as tuitions were a devaluing of the teachings rather than a direction for deriving their necessary value. Take the calling of his genius as a name for intuition. Then marking "Whim" on his door-post was its tuition, that is to say, an enactment of the obligation to remark it, to run the risk, or as Thoreau puts it, to sit the risk, of noting anything that happens to you, to make it notable, remarkable, thinkable, to subject yourself, as said, to intelligibility. How could we test the claim Emerson's writing makes to be such enactment - which means, test the writing's claim to enact or acknowledge itself, take on its existence; which can also be said to</page><page sequence="14">1 10 STANLEY CAVELL mean, using words of Nietzsche's, or rather Zarathustra's, which I imagine are more or less quoting Emerson's, that he "does not say T, but performs T." (The mere complication of self-reference, of saying T, the stock-in-trade of certain modernizers, may amount to nothing whatever, nothing beyond more rumor of your exist- ence.) How else but by letting the writing teach us how to test it, word by word? And indeed "Self-Reliance" as a whole can be taken as a theory-- I wish we knew how to call it an aesthetics- of reading. Its opening words are "I read the other day," and four paragraphs before he cites the Cogito he remarks, "Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic"; which is only to say that he finds us reading the way he finds us doing everything else. Then how can we read his theory of reading in order to learn how to read him? We would already have to understand it in order to understand it. I have elsewhere called this the (apparent) paradox of reading. It might just as well be called the paradox of writing, since of writing meant with such ambitions, it can as well be said that only after it has done its work of creating a writer (which may amount to sloughing or shaking off voices) can one know what it is to write. But you never know. I mean, you never know when someone will learn the posture, as for themselves, that will then make sense of a field of movement, it may be writing, or dancing, or passing a ball, or sitting at a keyboard, or free associating. So the sense of paradox is only an expression of our not understanding how such learning happens. What we wish to learn in the present case is nothing less than whether Emerson exists, hence could exist for us; whether, to begin with, his writing performs the Cogito he preaches. He explicitly claims that it does, as he must; but before noting that, I pause a little longer before this new major path I am not taking here, or branching of paths, that of the essay's theory of reading, hence of writing or of speaking, hence of seeing and hearing. The theory, not surprisingly, is a theory of communica- tion, hence of expression, hence of character, character conceived, as Emerson does always conceive it, as naming at once, as faces of one another, the human individual and human language. The writ- ing side of the theory is epitomized in the remark: "Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or</page><page sequence="15">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 1 1 vice emit a breath every moment." The reading side of the theory is epitomized in the remark: "To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking. Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger." On the reading side, the idea of mastering him is not that of controlling him exactly (though it will be related to monitoring him) but rather of coming into command of him, as of a difficult text, or instrument, or practice. That this mastery happens by obedience, which is to say, by a mode of listening, relates the process to his dedicating of his writing as heeding the call of his genius, which to begin with he is able to note as Whim. It follows that mastering his text is a matter of discerning the whim, let us say, from which it follows. On the writing side, the idea of com- municating as emitting a breath every moment (as if a natural risk of writing is transmitting disease), means that with every word you utter you say more than you know you say (the idea of genteel Emerson's here is that you cannot smell your own breath), which we already know to mean in part that you do not know in the moment the extent to which your saying is quoting. (I will not forbear again attracting attention to another path I keep managing not to take here, on which one becomes exquisitely sensible of the causes of Nietzsche's love of Emerson's writing. I am thinking now of Ecce Homo, a book about writing which bears the subtitle How One Becomes What One Is: whose Preface opens with the declaration that the author finds it indispensable now to say who he is, because in his conversations with the educated he becomes convinced that he is not alive; and continues by claiming or warning that to read him is to breathe a strong air; and whose opening part "Why I Am So Wise" closes with the statement that one trait of his nature that causes difficulty in his contacts with others is the uncanny sensitivity of his instinct for cleanliness, so that the innermost parts, the entrails, of every soul are smelled by him.) So the question Emerson's theory of reading and writing is designed to answer is not, "What does a text mean?" (and one may accordingly not wish to call it a theory of interpretation), but rather, "How is it that a text we care about in a certain way, expressed perhaps as our being drawn to read it with the obedience that masters, that such a text invariably says more than its writer</page><page sequence="16">112 STANLEY CA VELL knows, that writers and readers write and read beyond them- selves?"; which might be summarized as wanting an answer to the question, "What does a text know?," or in Emerson's term, "What is the genius of the text?" Here I note what strikes me as a congenial and fruitful con- junction with what I feel I have understood so far of the practices of Derrida and of Lacan. Others will take my conjunction with these practices as uncongenial, if, for example, they take it to imply that what I phrased as the genius of the text, or perhaps I should say the engendering of it, is fatal to or incompatible with the idea of the author and of an author's intention. This incompatibility ought to seem surprising since both genius and intending have to do with inclination, hence with caring about something, and with posture. J.L. Austin in a seminar discussion at Harvard in 1955, if I remem- ber, once compared the role of intending with the role of headlights on an automobile, and he may have included the steering mecha- nism. Perhaps some theorists need to be told that driving some- where (getting something done intentionally) does not on the whole happen by hanging a pair of headlights from your shoulders, sitting in an armchair, picking up an unattached steering wheel, and imag- ining your destination. (Though this is not unlike situations W.C. Fields has found himself in.) Perhaps they will understand if you begin enumerating what else has to be in place- the further mech- anisms and systems (transmission, fuel, electrical), the roads, the industries that produce and are produced by each, etc.- in order for headlights and a steering mechanism to do their work, even to be what they are. No doubt some theorists speak as though inten- tion were everything there is to meaning. But is that a sensible reason for asserting that intention is nothing, counts for nothing in meaning? Is W.C. Fields our only alternative to Humpty Dumpty? I ask out of affection.3 3. In linking W.C. Fields' suffering of convention with Humpty Dumpty's claim to be master, by his very wishes, of what words shall mean, I find I have not forgotten a passage during the discussion of "Must We Mean What We Say?" the day I delivered it in 1957 (at Stanford, it happens). Against a certain claim in my paper, one philosopher cited by name Humpty Dumpty's view of meaning as obviously, in all solemnity, the correct one. This was, I think, the first time I realized the possibility that parody is no longer a distinguishable intellectual tone since nothing can any longer be counted on to strike us in common as outra- geous.</page><page sequence="17">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 1 3 But I was about to locate Emerson's explicit statement, or performance, of his Cogito. In his eighth paragraph: 'Tew and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testi- mony." Earlier in the paragraph he had said: "My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. . .1 ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions." And two paragraphs later he will promise: "But do your work, and I shall know you." In refusing the evidence of actions, or say behavior, Emerson is refusing, as it were before the fact, the thrashing of empiricist philosophy to prove the existence of other minds on the basis of a so-called analogy with one's own case, which essentially involves an appeal to the other's behavior (and its similarity to our own) as all we can know of them with certainty. But then how does Emerson evade and counter the picture on which such a philosophical drift repeatedly comes to grief, namely the picture according to which we cannot literally or directly have the experiences of others, can- not have what Emerson apparently calls "primary evidence" of their existence. Emerson's counter is contained in the idea of what I called his promise: "But do your work, and I shall know you." Your work, what it is yours to do, is exemplified, confronted with Emerson's words, in reading those words; which means, mastering them; which means obeying and hence following them, as the writer undertakes to enact his existence in saying them. The test of following them is, according to Emerson's promise, that you will find yourself known by them, that you take yourself on in them. It is what Thoreau calls conviction, I mean calls being convicted by his words, read by them, sentenced. To acknowledge that I am known by what this text knows does not amount to agreeing with it, in the sense of believing it, as if it were a bunch of assertions or contained a doctrine. To be known by it is to find thinking in it. That would prove that a human existence is authorized in it. But how will you prove thinking? - or, what perhaps comes to the same: How will you show your conviction? One possibility is presented in the remark, "Self-reliance is the aversion of [conformity]." This almost says, and nearly means, that you find your existence in conversion, by converting to it, that thinking is a kind of turning oneself around. But what it directly</page><page sequence="18">1 1 4 STANLEY CAVELL says is that the world of conformity must turn from what he says as he must turn from it, and that since the process is never over while we live- since, that is, we are never finally free of one another- his reader's life with him will be turning from, and returning from, his words, moving on from them, by them. In the later, major essay 'Tate" Emerson calls this aversion "antagonism"- "Man is a stupendous antagonism" he says there. And I can testify that when you stop struggling with Emerson's words they become insupport- able. But why does self-reliance insist that it will know its other, even create its other, I mean authorize the other's self-authoriza- tion, or auto-creation? Because it turns out that the wish for assurance, as Descartes had put it, that I am not alone in the world, has turned out to require that I allow myself to be known, the thing I have called subjecting myself to intelligibility, or say legibility. Doesn't this beg the question, whether there are others there to do this knowing? I would rather say that it orders the question. The fantasy of aloneness in the world may be read to say that the step out of aloneness, say out of self-absorption, has to come without the assurance of others. (Not, perhaps, without help.) "No one comes" is a tragedy for a child. For a grown-up it means the time has come to be the one who goes first. To this way of thinking, politics ought to have provided conditions for companionship, call this fraternity; but its price has been the suppression, not the affirmation, of otherness, that is to say, of difference and of sameness, call these liberty and equality. A mission of this thinking is never to let politics forget this. In declaring that his life is not for a spectacle but is for itself, Emerson is not denying that it is a spectacle, and he thus inflects and re-crosses his running themes of being seen and hence of shame and hence of consciousness. I take a last citation on this subject to join initially "Self-Reliance" with Poe's "Imp of the Perverse." Emerson's fifth paragraph contains this: ". . .the (grown) man is as it were clapped into jail by his consciousness. [As if this were what growing up has come to.] As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this." The idea is that</page><page sequence="19">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 1 5 we have become permanently and unforgettably visible to one another, in a state of perpetual theater. To turn aside conscious- ness, supposing that were possible, would accordingly only serve to distract us from this fact of our mutual confinement, under one another's guard. The solution must then be to alter what it is we show, which requires turning even more watchfully to what it is we are conscious of, and altering our posture toward it. For example: "A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dis- misses without notice his own thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty." Here I find a specifi- cation of finding myself known in this text. I do seem to find in it certain rejected thoughts of mine coming back with what I am prepared to call alienated majesty (including the thought itself of my rejected thoughts). Then presumably this writer has managed not to dismiss his own thoughts but to call them together, keep them on parade, at attention. Yet he speaks from the condition of being a grown-up within the circumstances of civil (or uncivil) obedience he describes, so he says all he says clapped into jail by his consciousness- a dec- ade before Thoreau was clapped into jail, and for the same reason, for obeying the wrong thing. What is the method of his release? If, going on with Emerson's words, there were Lethe for our bondage to the attention of others, to their sympathy or to their hatred, we would utter opinions that would be "seen to be not private but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in fear "-that is, my visibility would then frighten my watchers, not the other way around, as now, and my privacy would no longer represent confinement but instead represent the conditions neces- sary for freedom. But as long as these conditions are not known to be achieved, the writer cannot know that I am known in his utterances, hence that he and I have each assumed our separate existences, so he will not know but that in taking assurance from the promise of knowing my existence he is only assuming my existence, hence his role in its affirmation, hence perhaps shifting the burden of proof from himself, still awaiting my releasing of him from his jail of consciousness, the consciousness of the con-</page><page sequence="20">116 STANLEY CAVELL sciousness of others. When is writing done! That "Self-Reliance" may accordingly be understood to show writing as a message from prison forms its inner connection with Poe's "Imp of the Perverse." (The thought of such a message forms of course other connections as well, for example with Rous- seau's Social Contract, whose famous early line, "Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains" names a condition from which the writer cannot be exempting his writing. Especially not if his inter- pretation of his writing's enchainment is to afford a step toward the freedom it is compelled, by its intuition of chains, to imagine.) It is perhaps just as well that I can hardly do more here with Poe's so-called tale than give some directions for how I think it should, or anyway can, be read. It is just as well because the validation of the reading requires from first to last that one take the time to try the claims on oneself. The claims have generally to do with the sound of Poe's prose, with what Emerson and Nietzsche would call its air or its smell. As it happens, Poe's tale is essentially about the breath it gives off. If we could agree that the sound of Poe's prose, of let me say its incessant and perverse brilliance, is uncannily like the sound of philosophy, as if a parody of philosophy- as the sound of philoso- phy is established in Descartes- then I could formulate my guiding claim about this writing as follows: in Poe's tales the thought is being worked out that philosophy exists, anyway now, only as a parody of philosophy, or rather as something perhaps indistin- guishable from the perversion of philosophy, as if the overthrow of the reign of reason, the reason philosophy was born to establish, is not alone the task of, let us say, poetry, but is now openly the genius or mission of philosophy itself. As if the task of disestablish- ing reason is the task of reconceiving it, of exacting a transforma- tion or reversal of what we think of as thinking, and so of what we think of as establishing the reign of thinking. A natural conse- quence in reading such writing is that you may be unsure whether the writer is perfectly serious in what he says. I dare say that the writer may be thus unsure, and that this may be a good sign that the writing is doing its work, taking its course. Then Poe's peculiar brilliance is to have discovered a sound, or the condition, of intelli- gence in which not the reader and not the writer knows whether he</page><page sequence="21">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 1 7 or she is philosophizing, thinking as it were to some end. This is an insight, it seems a philosophical insight, about philosophy, namely that it is as difficult to stop philosophizing as it is to start. (As difficult, in Wittgenstein's words, as to bring philosophy peace. Most people I know who care about philosophy either do not see this as a philosophical problem, or they do not believe that it has a solution.) A convenient way of establishing what I mean by the sound of Poe's Tales is to juxtapose the opening sentences of, say, "The Black Cat" with some early sentences from Descartes 's Medita- tions. Here is Descartes: There is no novelty to me in the reflection that, from my earliest years, I have accepted many false opinions as true, and that what I have concluded from such badly assured premises could not but be highly doubtful and uncertain. . .1 have found a serene retreat in peaceful solitude. I will therefore make a serious and unimpeded effort to destroy generally all my former opinions. . . Everything which I have thus far accepted as entirely true and assured has been acquired from the senses or by means of the senses. But I have learned by experience that these senses sometimes mislead me, and it is pru- dent never to trust wholly those things which have once deceived us. . .But it is possible that, even though the senses occasionally deceive us. . .there are many other things which we cannot reasonably doubt. . .-as, for example, that I am here, seated by the fire, wearing a winter dressing gown, holding this paper in my hands, and other things of this nature. And how could I deny that these hands and this body are mine, unless I am to compare myself with certain lunatics. . .(who) imagine that their head is made of clay, or that they are gourds, or that their body is glass?. . .Nevertheless, I must remember that I am a man, and that consequently I am accustomed to sleep and in my dreams to imagine the same things that lunatics imagine when awake. . .1 real- ize so clearly that there are no conclusive indications by which waking life can be distinguished from sleep that I</page><page sequence="22">118 STANLEY CA VELL am quite astonished, and my bewilderment is such that it is almost able to convince me that I am sleeping.4 Now listen to Poe: For the most wild, yet almost homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not - and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and today I would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. In their consequences, these events have terri- fied-have tortured- have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them.5 The juxtaposition, which I leave here essentially without comment, is to work both ways, to bring out at once Poe's bril- liance, and what is more to suggest his argumentative soundness, and at the same time to bring out Descartes's creepy, perverse claim, given the subjects his light of reason rakes across, the air of a mad diarist. Moreover, the Meditations make their appearance within the content of "The Imp of the Perverse," as indelibly, to my mind, as in "Self-Reliance." Before noting this let me briefly and generally describe this lesser known tale. It is divided into two parts, each more or less eight paragraphs in length. The first half is, as Poe had said in reviewing certain of Hawthorne's tales, not a tale at all but an essay. The essay argues for the existence of perverseness as a radical, primitive, irreducible faculty or sentiment of the soul, the propensity to do wrong for the wrong's sake, promptings to act for the reason that we should aio/- something it finds overlooked by phrenologists, moralists, and in great measure "all metaphysi- cianism," through "the pure arrogance of the reason." This phrase, "the pure arrogance of reason," to my ear, for the moment 4. The translation is that of Laurence J. Lafleur (New York, 1951). 5. Collected Works of Edgar Allan Poe, ed. Thomas Olli ve Mabbott (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1978).</page><page sequence="23">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 1 9 lent to Poe, signals that he is writing a Critique of the arrogance of pure reason- as if the task, even after Kant, were essentially incomplete, even unbegun. (This characterization should not be taken as incompatible with the appreciation of Poe as a psycholo- gist, but only incompatible with a certain idea of what psychology may be.) The second half "The Imp of the Perverse," which tells the tale proper, begins as follows. I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question - that I may explain to you why I am here - that I may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the con- demned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse. Since we have not been depicted as asking, or having, a ques- tion, the narrator's explanation insinuates that we ought to have one about his presence, hence raises more questions than it formu- lates. The tale turns out to be a Poe-ish matter concerning the deliberately wrought murder of someone for the apparent motive of inheriting his estate, a deed that went undetected until some years later the writer perversely gave himself away. The means of the murder the writer gives as follows: "I knew my victim's habit of reading in bed. . .1 substituted, in his bed-room candlestand, a [poisoned] wax-light of my own making, for the one which I there found." The self-betrayal comes about when, as he puts it, "I arrested myself in the act." What act he arrests himself in is the murmuring, half-aloud, of the syllables "I am safe," and then adding "-yes, if I be not fool enough to make open confession." "I felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. . .Alas! I well, too well understood that, to think, in my situation, was to be lost. . .1 bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfare. At length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me." To the first of what I am calling my directions for reading</page><page sequence="24">1 20 STANLEY CAVELL 'The Imp" I expect nowadays little resistance, namely that both the fiction of the writer's arresting himself and his wearing these fetters and tenanting this cell of the condemned, as well as the fiction of providing a poisonous wax-light for reading, are descrip- tions or fantasies of what writing is, modeled by the writing before us. There is, or at least we need imagine, no actual imprisoning and no crime but the act of this writing itself. So an immediate issue for us is what it means to fantasize that words are fetters and cells and that to read them, to be awake to their meaning, or effect, is to be poisoned. Are we being told that writer and reader are one anoth- er's victims? Or is the suggestion that to arrive at the truth some- thing in the reader as well as something in the writer must die? Does it ward off, or invite in, the angel of death? I expect more resistance, or puzzlement, upon the further proposal that the fiction of words that are in themselves perhaps unremarkable ("I am safe"), the saying of which annihilates the sayer, is a specification of the claim that "I well, too well under- stood that, to think in my situation was to be lost"- which is a kind of negation, say a perversion, of the Cogito. Rather than proving and preserving me, as in Descartes, thinking is now seen to precipitate my destruction. A little earlier Poe's narrator makes this even clearer: There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him, who shuddering on the edge of a preci- pice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. . .we plunge, and are destroyed. If the Whim drawing on Emerson's "Self-Reliance" is to say "I do not think, therefore I do not exist," that of Poe's Imp is to say, "I think, therefore I am lost." Granted this connection, it is enforced in noticing the occurrence in the brief passage just cited of the words "meditates" and "demon(iacally)." I add that I do not for myself resist the further suggestion that Poe's undetected, poisoned wax-light substitutes for, or say alludes to, Descartes's most famous example (of materiality) in the Meditations, the piece of melting wax whose identity is not determinable empirically, but</page><page sequence="25">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 2 1 only by an innate conception in the understanding. (That in Poe's tale the act of thinking destroys by alarming the populace and turning them against the thinker, and that perverseness is noted as the confessing of a crime not as the committing of it [as if the confessing and the committing of a crime are figurations of one another], are paths of parody and perverseness I mostly cannot trace here.) My third suggestion for reading Poe's tale is that the presiding image collecting the ideas I have cited and setting them in play is given in its title. The suggestion, which I simply state here, is that the title names and illustrates a common fact about language and even on that basis invokes what one might think of as an Emerso- nian theory of language, the possession of language as the subjec- tion of oneself to the intelligible. The fact of language it illustrates is registered in the series of what I will call imp-words that pop up throughout the sixteen paragraphs of the tale: there is impulse (several times), impels (several times), impatient (twice), important, impertinent, imperceptible, impossible, unimpressive, imprisoned, and, of course, Imp. Moreover, "imp.," is used as an abbreviation in English for imperative, imperfect, imperial, import, imprimatur, impersonal, implement, improper, and improvement. Let us add that "Imp.," is an abbreviation for Emperor and Empress. Now if to speak of the imp of the perverse is in the first place to name the imp in English, namely as the initial sounds of a number of charac- teristically Poe-ish terms, then to speak of something called the perverse as containing this imp is to speak of language itself, specifically of English, as the perverse. But what is it about the imp of English that is perverse, hence presumably helping to produce as users of language, us imps? It may well be the prefix "im-" that is in the first place felt as perverse, since, like the prefix "in-," it has opposite meanings. With adjectives it is a negation or privative, as in immediate, immaculate, imperfect, imprecise, improper, implacable, impious, impecunious; with verbs it is an affirmation or intensive, as in imprison, impinge, imbue, implant, impulse, implicate, imperson- ate. (It is not impossible that per-verse, applied to language, should be followed out as meaning also poetic through and through.) In plain air we keep the privative and the intensive well enough apart no doubt, but in certain circumstances (say in dreams, in which,</page><page sequence="26">1 22 STANLEY CAVELL according to Freud, logical operations like negation are not regis- terable or picturable, but are to be supplied later, by the dreamer's interpretation) we might grow confused as to whether, for example, immuring means putting something into a wall or letting something out of one; or whether impotence means powerlessness or a special power directed to something special; or whether implanting is the giving or the removing of life; or whether impersonate means putting on another personality or being without personhood. But the fact or the idea of imp-words is not a function of just that sequence of three letters. Word-imps would be the name of any of the recurrent combinations of letters of which the words of a language are composed. They are part of the way words have their familiar looks and sounds, and their familiarity depends upon our mostly, as it were, not noticing the particles, or cells, and their laws, which constitute words and their imps; which is above all to say, not noticing their necessary recurrences; which is perhaps only to say that recurrence is what constitutes familiarity. It is this necessity, the most familiar property there could be of language- that if there is to be language, words and their cells recur, as if fettered in their orbits; that language is grammatical (to say the least)- that insures what we may think of as the self-referentiality of language. When we do note these cells or molecules, these little moles of language (perhaps in thinking, perhaps in derangement) what we discover are the imps of words, however spelled, the initial, or it may be medial or final movements, the implanted origins or constituents of words, leading lives of their own, staring back at us, calling upon one another, giving us away, alarming, because to note them is to see that they live in front of our eyes, within earshot, at every moment. But the perverseness of language, working without, even against, our thought, its autonomy, is not just a function of neces- sarily recurring imps of words, but of the necessity for us speakers of language, us authors of it, or imps, or Emperors and Empresses of it, to mean something in and by our words, to desire to say something, some things rather than others, in certain ways rather than in others; or else to work to avoid meaning them. Call these necessities the impulses and the implications of the saying of our words. There is, as with the saying of "I am safe," in which its utterance destroyed safety, in which saying defeats what is said, a</page><page sequence="27">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 23 question whether in speaking one is affirming something or negat- ing it. In particular, has the impulse to self-destruction, or giving oneself away, betraying oneself, in such writing as Poe's, become the only way of preserving the individual? And does it succeed? Is authoring an act of the obliteration or of the apotheosis of the writer? In the passage I cited earlier from "The Black Cat" its writer does not speak of being in fetters and in a cell, but he does name his activity as penning; and since the activity at hand is autobiography, he is penning himself. Is this release or incarceration? He enforces the question by going on to say that he will not expound- that is, will not remove something (presumably himself) from a pound, or pen. But this may mean that he is awaiting expounding by the reader. Would this be shifting the burden of his existence onto some other? And who might we be to bear such a burden? Mustn't we also seek to shift it? Granted that we need one another's acknowledgment, isn't there in this very necessity a mutual victim- ization, one that our powers of mutual redemption cannot over- come? Is this undecidable? Or is deciding this question exactly as urgent as deciding to exist? I will draw to my close by forming three questions that the texts I have put together here invite for investigation. 1 . What does it betoken about the relation of philosophy and literature that a piece of writing can be seen to consist of what is for all the world a philosophical essay preceding, I would like to say turning into, what is for all the world a fictional tale, as it happens a fictional confession from a prison cell? To answer this would require, I find, a meditation on the paragraph, cited earlier, in which Poe pivots from the essay to fhe tale, insinuating that we are failing to ask a question about the origin of the writing, and claiming that without the philosophical preface - which here means without the hinging of essay and tale, philosophy and fiction - the reader, "with the rabble, (would) have fancied me mad," not perceiving that he is "one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse." The meditation would thus enter, or center, on the idea of counting, and it is in fact one I have undertaken, under somewhat different circumstances, as Part I of The Claim of Reason. There I interpret Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investiga-</page><page sequence="28">124 STANLEY CAVELL tions, or its guiding idea of a criterion, hence of grammar, in their responsiveness to skepticism, as providing the means by which the concepts of our language are of anything, which I guess is to say, showing what it means to have concepts; how it is, I like to put it, that we are able to word the world together. The idea of a criterion I emphasize is that of a way of counting something as something, and I go on to put this together with accounting and recounting, hence projecting a connection between telling as a numbering or computing and telling as relating or narrating. Poe's (or if you insist, Poe's narrator's) speaking pivotally of being an uncounted victim accordingly suggests to me that philosophy and literature have come together (for him; but who is he?) at the need for recounting, that is, for counting again; and first at counting the human beings there are, for reconceiving them; a recounting beginning from the circumstance that it is I, some I or other, who counts, i.e., who is able to do the thing of counting, of conceiving a world; that it is I who, taking others into account, establish criteria for what is worth saying, hence for the intelligible; but only on the condition that I count, that I matter, that it matters that I count in my agreement or attunement with those with whom I maintain my language, from whom this inheritance therefore comes, language as the condition of counting - so that it matters not only what some I or other says but that it is some particular I who desires in some specific place to say it. If my counting fails to matter, I am mad. It is being uncounted - being left out, as if my story is untenable - that makes what I say (seem) perverse, makes me odd. The surmise that we have become unable to count one another, to count for one another, is philosophically a surmise that we have lost the capacity to think, that we are stupefied.6 I call this condition living our skepticism. 2. What does it betoken about fact and fiction that Poe's writing simultaneously tells two tales of imprisonment - in one of which he is absent, in the other present - as if fables of one 6. It is hard not to imagine that this surmise has to do with the history of the collection of statistical tables mentioned in Ian Hacking's paper for the same conference for which this paper was initially written. Hard for me because Emerson's essay "Fate" self-consciously invokes the new science of statistics as a new image of human fate- a new way in which others are finding us captured by knowledge and which Emerson finds a further occasion for ignorance.</page><page sequence="29">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 25 another? Is it knowable whether one of them is the more funda- mental? Here is the relevance I see in Poe's tale of the Imp invoking the situation of Hamlet, the figure of our culture most famously enacting a question of undecidability; in particular an undecidabil- ity over the question whether to believe a tale of poisoning. (By the way, Hamlet at the end, as his father's ghost at the beginning, claims to have a tale that is untenable - it is what makes both of them ghosts.) In Poe's tale the invocation of Hamlet is heard, for example, in the two appearances of a ghost, the first time disap- pearing upon the crowing of a cock. And it is fully marked in the second of the three philosophical examples of perversity that Poe* s narrator offers in order to convince any reader, in his words, "who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul," of "the entire radicalness of the propensity in question. " Here is that second example. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet- tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work ... It must, it shall be undertaken today, and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why? There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful because unfathomable, craving for delay. These words invoke Hamlet for me along lines suspiciously like those in which I had recently been thinking about what I call Hamlet's burden of proof - but no more suspiciously, surely, than my beginning to study Poe while thinking about Hamlet. The play Hamlet studies the impulse to taking revenge and to taking thought as a response to being asked to assume the burden of another's existence; as if that were the burden, or price, of assuming one's own; a burden that denies one's own. In Hamlet's case, it is being asked to make a father's life work out successfully, come out even, to take his revenge for him. I am led to take the emphasis in the question "To be or not . . ." not as on whether to</page><page sequence="30">126 STANLEY CA VELL die but on whether to be born, you may say whether to affirm or deny the fact of natality, a way of enacting, or not, one's existence. To accept birth is to participate in a world of revenge, of mutual victimization, of shifting and substitution. But to refuse to partake of it is to poison everyone who touches you, as if taking your own revenge. This is why if the choice is unacceptable the cause is not metaphysics but history, say a posture toward the discovery that there is no getting even for the oddity of being born, hence of being and becoming the one poor creature it is given to you to be. The alternative to affirming this condition is, as Descartes's Medi- tations shows, world-consuming doubt, which is hence a standing threat to, or say condition of, human existence. (I imagine that the appearance of the Cogito at its historical moment is a sign that some conditions were becoming ones for which getting even, or anyway over-coming, was coming to seem in order, for example, the belief in God and the rule of Kings.) That there should be something like a choice or decision concerning our natality is what I take Freud's idea of the diphasic structure of human sexual devel- opment to show - a provision of, so to speak, the condition of the possibility of such a decision. The condition is that of adolescence, considered as the period in which, as preparation for becoming adult, one recapitulates, as suffering re-birth, one's knowledge of satisfactions. This is why, it seems to me, one speculates about Hamlet's age but thinks of him as adolescent. These matters are represented in political thought under the heading of consent, about which, understandably, there has from the outset been a question of proof. 3. Finally, what does it betoken about American philosophy that Emerson and Poe may be seen as taking upon themselves the problematic of the Cogito, Emerson by denying or negating it, Poe by perverting or subverting it, and as sharing, what is more, the perception that authoring, anyway philosophical writing, writing as thinking, is such that to exist it must assume, or acknowledge, the proof of its own existence? I have in effect said that to my mind it betokens a claim on their parts to be discovering or rediscovering the origin of modern philosophy, as that is sketched in Descartes's Meditations; as if literature in America is forgiving philosophy, not without punishing it, for having thought that it could live only in the banishment of literature. But now I am asking what it means</page><page sequence="31">Being Odd, Getting Even 1 27 that figures such as these, apparent opposites like Emerson and Poe, are the ones entering such a claim within half a dozen years of one another. The question has lately presented itself to me in the following terms. Let us ask what the connection is between Emerson's ecsta- cies (together here with Thoreau's) and Poe's horrors (together here with Hawthorne's). The connection fairly clearly must be some function of the fact that Poe's and Hawthorne's worlds, or say houses and rooms, have other people in them, typically mar- riages, and typically show their violent shunning; whereas Emer- son's and Thoreau's worlds begin with or after the shunning of others ("I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me") and typically depict the "I" just beside itself. The interest of the connection is that all undertake to imagine domesti- cation, or inhabitation - as well, being Americans, they might. For Emerson and Thoreau you must learn to sit at home, or sit still in some attractive spot in the woods, as if to marry the world, before, if ever, you take on the burden of others; for Poe and Hawthorne even America came too late, or perhaps it comes too close, for that priority. A more particular interest I have in the connection among these American writers is a function of taking their concepts or portrayals of domestication and inhabitation (with their air of ecstacy and of horror turned just out of sight) as developments called for by the concepts of the ordinary and the everyday as these enter into the ordinary language philosopher's undertaking to turn aside skepticism, in the pains Austin and Wittgenstein take to lay out what it is that skepticism threatens. In the work of these philosophers in their stubborn, accurate superficiality, perhaps for the first time in recognizable philosophy, this threat of world- consuming doubt is interpreted in all its uncanny homeliness, not merely in isolated examples, but, in Poe's words, as "a series of mere household events." I end upon the following prospect. If some image of marriage, as an interpretation of domestication, in the writers I take up, is the fictional equivalent of what the philosophers I take on understand as the ordinary, or the everyday; then the threat to the ordinary named skepticism should show up in fiction's favorite threat to forms of marriage, namely in forms of melodrama. Accordingly,</page><page sequence="32">128 STANLEY CA VELL melodrama may be seen as an interpretation of Descartes's Cogito, and contrariwise, the Cogito can be seen as an interpretation of the advent of melodrama - of the moment (private and public) at which the theatricalization of the self becomes the sole proof of its freedom and its existence. This is said on tip-toe.* ♦A version of this paper was read at an interdisciplinary conference entitled "Recon- structing Individualism" sponsored by the Stanford Humanities Center Feb. 18-20, 1984.
