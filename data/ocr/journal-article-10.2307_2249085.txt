<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.-IS BERGSON'S PHILOSOPHY MONISTIC? BY S. RADHAKRISHNAN. THE main tendency of Bergson's philosophy is monistic, for according to him there is a universal principle, spiritual in nature, in which all existence is gathered, an initial psychical movement which is responsible for the whole evolution. Creative evolution may be literally compared to the spreading of different branches from a single root. The elan vital goes on spreading new branches, creating new novelties. Matter, life, consciousness are such branches. They are the diver- gent developments of the unity at the start, where the different tendencies are fused in-to one. " Evolution arises from an original identity." "Evolutionary process, spraying out like a sheaf, sunders in proportion to their simultaneous growth, terms which at first completed each other so well that they coalesced" (Creative Evolution, p. 124). All life is a unity and the unity is derived from the initial impetus. A single principle of creation is at the base of things (C. E., p. 291). While thus ]Mergson's aim as well as the main tendency of his philosophy is moztistic, in the detailed de- velopment of his view he posits the existence of a- second factor, matter, which is indispensable for both the origin and continuance of evolution. " When a shell bursts, the par- ticular way it breaks is explained both by the explosive force of the powder it contains, and by the resistance of the metal. So of the way life breaks into individuals and species. It de- pends, we think, on two series of causes: the resistance life meets from inert matter, and the explosive force which life bears within itself" (C. E., p. 103, see also p. 134). The presence of the resisting force of the matter is needed to start and maintain the evolutionary process. Without matter to call forth the activity of the elan, the latter will be reduced to the level of Spinoza's Substance, inert, static, and incapable of moving into the world of sense-perception. The vital im- pulse is regarded by Bergson as an effort. It meets with the obstacle of matter at the outset of its course. Its mission is to graft on the necessity of physical forces the greatest 22</page><page sequence="2">330 S. RADHAKRISHNAN: possible amount of indetertmination. To cope with the physical necessity it requires energy, which it cannot create. It makes use of the pre-existing energy at its disposal (see C. E., p. 121). The two, life and matter, through their inter- a.ction, create the universe with all its varieties. Matter appears to be quite as original and fundamental for the world process as the life principle itself. If this is the conclusion of Bergson's philosophy he is not a monist but a dualist. It is this question of the ultimate unity or duality of life and matter we here propose to discuss. 'I. In Time and Free-will,. Bergson vindicates the freedom of human consciousness. He points out how determinism dis- torts the flowing life of consciousness by spatialising it and representing it as a succession of states. The illusion of necessity is due to intellect, which twists out of its shape duration or the real inwardness of conscious life. " Pure duration is the form which the succession of our conscious states assumes when our ego lets itself live, when it refrains from separating its present state from its former states" (T. and F. W., p. 100). Conscious life and inert matter have opposed characteristics. The mechanical ideal may be ade- quate to the representation of external reality which is spatial and solid, but it, is inadequate to that of life or consciousness which is duration. Life is dynamic while matter is static. In Time and Free-will, the dualism or the opposition be- tween the two, matter and life, space and time, mechanism and dynamism is the most prominent feature. We have* a real material world with a multiplicity of objects, a world of space quantity and simultaneity; opposed to it there is a world of change, quality and succession. " Within our ego, there is succession without mutual externality; outside the ego is pure space, mutual externality without succession. There is a real space without duration in which phenomena appear and disappear simultaneously with our state of con- 8ciousness. There is a real duration, the heterogeneous moments of which permeate one another" (T. and F. W., pp. 108 and 110). Bergson here affirms the separate exist- ence of two spheres of reality, conscious life and inert matter. Intellect is viewed as giving a defective vision of conscious life though it is adequate to the representation of matter. This dualism though greatly modified still survives in Creative Evolution. " The human instinct feels at home among inani- mate objects, more especially among solids. Our intellect</page><page sequence="3">IS BERGSON'S PHILOSOPHY MONISTIC ? 331 triumphs in Geometry, wherein is revealed the kinship of logical thought with unorganised matter" (C. E., p. ix). Again, " For a conscious being to exist is to change . . . a material object remains as it is or else, if it changes under the influence of an' external force, our idea of this change is, that of a displacement of parts, which themselves do not change" (C. E., p. 8). A rigorous dualism between soul life which is change and material object to which change is ex- ternal is set up. 11. Soon a difficulty presents itself. How can we account for motion or change in the external world ? If the woTld outside is purely spatial and therefore timeless, then motion becomes an illusion. If all change were psychical, then motion is not chanae. It is but a sum of simultaneities devoid of the very essence of change which is time. But Bergson is nMot pre- pared to say that motion outside is unreal. Movement, what- ever be its nature, is " an indisputable reality " (Matter and Memory, p. 254). Bergson is constrained to admit that the world outside is also a becoming. Matter is a kind of motion. Modern science in its analysis of the- atom into vibrations supports his view. It is not to his purpose to discuss the much-debated question of the nature of the electron. The whole is of the nature of the self. Concrete movement is "capable like consciousness of prolonging its past into the present " (iMl. and M., p. 329). " Matter or mind, reality here appeared to us as a perpetual becoming" (C. E., p. 287). That mind is change, we have direct evidence. That matter is also movement " our intellect and senses themselves would show . . . if they could obtain a direct and disinterested idea of it " (C. E., p. 288). " Pure intuition, external or internal, is that of an undivided continuity. We break up this con- tinuity into elements laid side by 'side, which correspond in the one case to distinct words, in the other to independent objects" (M. and M., p. 239). Bergson forgets that the re- duction of self and universe to motion knocks the bottom out of his defence of freedom in Time and Free-will. Freedom originally confined to human consciousness is now extended to the totality of being. " There is no reason why a duration and so a form of existence like our own should not be attri- buted to the system that science isolates, provided such systems are re-integrated into the whole " (C. E., p. 12). The last part of this sentence suggests the reconciliation between the two views 6f matter, that it is an inert thi4g and that it</page><page sequence="4">332 S. RADHAKRISHNAN: is a kind of motion. The whole is a flux. The universe en- dures. Duration is the "very substance of the world in which we live" (C. E., p. 41). "Matter looked at as an undivided whole must be a flux rather than a thing-" (C. E., p. 196). For purposes of science we cut off portions of re- ality and view them in their isolation. Matter, as the scien- tist regards it, is subject to complete mechanism. For science we want repetition according to Bergson and repetition is pos- sible only in the abstract. In the real world there is nothing fixed, no absolute rest, but all is flow, action, creative evolu- tion. Matter as stable and solid is unreal. " All division of matter into independent bodies with absolutely determined outlines is an artificial division " (M. and M., p. 259). Intellect, makes sections in the continuous flow of becoming which constitutes reality, for purposes of science and action. " The distinct outlines of an object are only the design of a certain kind of influence w6 might exert on a certain part of space. It is the plan of our eventual actions that is sent baQk to our eyes as though by a mirror when we see the surfaces and edges of things. Suppress this action and wiih it conse- quently those inain directions which by perception are traced out for it in the entanglement of the real, and the individual- ity of the body is re-absorbed in the universal interaction which, without doubt, is reality itself" (C. E., p. 12). The, mathematical and logical ideals are inadequate to the repre- sentation of both life and matter. Bergson does not say that matter is phenomenal in the sense that intellectual categories create matter. He only says that they misrepresent it.. Matter exists independently of intellect as soul life exists.. But it is in a fluid condition. Intellect cuts out cross sections. of this flow, sharpens their outlines and solidifies their. con- tents. Thus, inert matter 'on further analysis has become practically identical with conscious life. The real world, subjective as well as objective, is dynamic, and can be grasped only by intuitionl. If we start from the side of consciousness it is possible to establi,sh the kinship of conscious life with inert matter. In Time and Free-will, Bergson has admitted the possibility of treating conscious life from the static standpoint. Though the essence of conscious life is interpenetration or melting into one another, this coalescence is not always present in the same degree. " It is by no means the case that all conscious states blend with one another as rain-drops with the water of a lake. The self in so far as it has to do with a homogeneous space, develops on a kind of surface and on this surface independent growths may form and float " (T.</page><page sequence="5">IS BERGSON S PHILOSOPHY MONISTIC? 333 and F. W., p. 166). It is also necessary to view conscious life statically, as there is a definite- relation to the objective world in all conscious states. " Every moment of conscious- ness is contemporaneous with a state of the external world." The distinction between subjective and objective has become so fluid that it is practically impossible to treat the 6ne as dynamic and the other as static. " Neither is space so foreign to our nature as we imagine nor is matter so com- pletely extended in space a's our senses and intellect repre- sent it " (C. E., p. 214). " What is given are not inextensive sensations: how should they find their way back to space, choose a locality within it, and co-ordinate themselves there so as to build up an experience that is common to all men ? And what is real is not extension, divided into independent parts; how being deprived of all possible relationship to our consciousness, could it unfold a series of changes of which the relations and the order exactly correspond to the rela- tions and the order of our representations?" (M. and M., p. -326). Conscious life and inert matter are both dynamic and static. Possibly, life can be understood in its essence if treated dynamically and martter statically. It is this community of nature between matter and spirit that Bergson emphasises in his book on Matter and Memory. Our intellect adapted to action breaks the world into two and devises all sorts of artificial remedies to glue them together. Idealism and realism are futile attempts in that direction. If we bear in mind that the dualism is a later product, born of and bred by intellect and not primitive and radical to reality, the problem which idealism and realism attempt to solve vanishes. If by' intuition we return to, the, whole, the false distinctions set up by conceptual analysis disappear. " The obscurity of this problem in all doctrines is due to the double antithesis which our understanding establishes between the extended and the unextended on the one side, between quality and quantity on the other" (M. and M., p. 235). Our understanding "creates the opposition which it afterwards contemplates amazed" (M. anzd M., p. 327). But in reality, the problem of perception is slurred over and not solved by Bergson. He evades it by employing the word 'image' in reference to matter. This queer usage suggests that matter is of the same essence as consciousness. But Bergson is aware that in spite' of his dubious devices, the dualism persists. The very title matter and memory indicates the dualism, for memory is the essen- tial function of spirit. What Bergson has actually achieved is the reduction'of mind and matter to movement. They</page><page sequence="6">334 S. RADHAKRISHNAN: are no more two spheres of reality but are two opposed and coexisting movements, two processes opposite in their direc- tion, "This book affirms the reality of spirit and the -reality of matter... It is then frankly dualistic" (M. and M.., p. . vii). III. In Creative Evolution the independence and self-existence of matter is a vital necessity. The account of "the relation of matter to life is transferred from human life t6 the cosmic whole. In man, the discord between spirit and matter is all in all. Growth and development of self is due to the conqutest over material obstacles which thwart the evolution of self. Without the struggle between the two, there would be no life, no change and the individual may be regarded as practi- cally non-existent. Even so' the cosmic spirit cannot move out without the resisting medium of matter. Through the interaction of the two the whole universe arises (see C. E., p. 123). Again, life is an effort to insert into matter the largest possible amount of indetermination (see C. E., p. 132). "I cannot regard the general evolution and progress of life in the whole of the organised world, the co-ordination and subordination of vital functions to one another in the same living being, the relations which, psychology and physiology combined, seem bound to establish between brain activity and thought in man, without arriving at this conclusion that life is an immense effort attenmpted by thought to obtain of matter something which matter does not wish to give it" (Report of the French Philosophical Society Meeting, 2nd May, 1901, quoted in Leroy's A New Philo- sophy: Henri Bergson, p. 97). This effort requires' energy which life cannot create., "All that the effort can do is to make the best of a pre-existing energy which it finds at its disposal. Now it finds only one way of succeeding in this, viz., to secure an accumulation of potential energy from matter" (C. E., p. 121, "The impetus of life consists in a need of creation. It cannot create absolutely because it is confronted with matter " (C. E., p. 265). Matter is thus an essential factor confronting life and- provoking its activity. The very nature of' the creative evolution will be inexplicable without the independent existence of matter. The evolution of life is not the realisation of a predestined plan for there are a million by-paths which end as blind alleys. " Progress is accomplished only on the two or three great lines of evolu- tion in which forms ever more and more high appear; be-</page><page sequence="7">IS BERGSON S PHILOSOPHY MONISTIC? 335 tween these lines run a crowd of minor paths, in which on the contrary, deviations, arrests and set-backs are multiplied" (0. E., pp. 109 and 110). These accidents can be accounted for only as the ways and means put forward by the creative principle to overcome the resistance of inert matter. If the resisting matter were absent, then these failures, 'deviations, arrests and set-backs,' will have to be laid at the door of the vital impulse itself. To avoid it Bergson assumes two original and ultimate principles, life and opposing it matter. When the two conflicting principles are present, the rest of the evolution of the universe is child's play to a philosopher of the brilliance of Bergson. If Bergson's system is to be viewed as monistic, it is neces- sary to reduce the duality of life and matter to an ultimate unity by reducing either life to matter or matter to life or both to one common principle. We cannot reduce life to matter, for it is to assume that Bergson has written his volumes in vain. If there is one point more than another that he emphasises in his writings, it is the absurdity of nechanising life, or spatialising spirit. Can we reduce matter to life and regard it as the first effect of life's evolution ? It hardly seems possible to do so for life cannot evolve until matter is present opposing it. Evolution presupposes the existence of matter. Granting that life can come out with its possibilities even without the resistance of matter, it ought to have engendered something more useful and imn- portant than sheer matter, especially in view of the fact that the evolution of life is unimpeded by any resisting influence. To imagine that the creative imnpulse gave birth to matter on account of its importance in the later stages of evolution is to import the anthropomorphic or finalistic tendency into Bergson's philosophy. That life should first throw out matter and then play a mimic scene opposing it and with great trouble pressing through and penetrating it, is not conceivable. We are left with the third possibility, the reduction of the two principles to one common centre. Bergson resolves the dualism by making both life and matter spring from one source. "If our analysis is cor- rect, it is consciousness or rather supra-consciousness, that is at the origin of life. Consciousness or supra-conscious- ness, is the name for the rocket whose extinguished frag- ments fall back as matter: Consciousness again is the name for that which subsists of the rocket itself passing through the fragments and lighting them up into organisms " (C. E., p. 275). Thus Bergson reduces matter and life to conscious- ness. All reality is spiritual. The whole is spirit. Bergson's</page><page sequence="8">336 S. RADHAKRISHNAN: system is a spiritualistic monism. But there are difficulties in the way of this theory. Why should the supra-conscious- ness fractionate itself ? Why should it break in twain ? The evolution of life on this planet is due to its opposition to matter. We ask if the original supra-consciousness or ulti- mate spirit can evolve into life and matter without the exist- ence of an outside extraneous force, why can we not say that even life on earth does the same ? If -the supra-con:sciousness can give out branches, can work out its evolution without any resisting medium, why should we presume that evolu- tion of life on this planet alone requires a resisting obstacle to force it to come out with its possibilities? Evolution must be essentially the same whether it is the evolution of ultimate spirit into life and matter or the evolution of life into plants, animals, and men. Either both require resisting forces or both can dispense with them. The latter alterna- tive does not commend itself to Bergson. So even for the evolution of the ultimate psychical something, a resisting matter is needed. We get back to the dualism of God and matter, supra-consciousness and space. In this difficulty, Bergson makes matter a negative idea. Matter and Memory establishes that life and matter are two opposing movements. There a re passages in Creative Evoli- tion which imply the same view. "Life as a whole, from the initial impulsion that thrust it into the world, will appear as a wave which rises and which is opposed by the descend- ing movement of matter." " Life is a movement, materiality is the inverse movement, and each of these movements is simnple, the matter which forms a world being an undivided flux, and undivided also the life which runs through it, cutting out in it living being all along its track." " As the smallest grain of dust is bound up with our entire solar system, drawn along with it in that undivided movement of descent which is materiality itself, so all organised beings from the humblest to the highest, from the first origins of life to the time in which we are, and in all places and in all times, do but evidence a single impulsion, the inverse of the movement of matter and in itself indivisible" (C. B., chap. iii.). So long as there are two distinct movements, Bergson is not a monist. But he soon makes out that one of these movements is real and the other phenomenal. Matter is not an independent movement but only the inverse of the ascending movement of life. " It is a descent which is only an interruption of a rige" (C. E., p. 291). Matter "endures only by its con- nexion with that which ascends" (C. E., p. 390). Reality is one continuous, creative ascending movement. Its arrest</page><page sequence="9">IS BERGSON7S PHILOSOPHY MONISTIC'? 337 or interruption gives us matter. Matter is thus the negation of the spiritual movement. There is only one movement and that is spiritual. Its interruption gives th6 inverse of it and that is matter. But we cannot understand why the ascending movement should have been interrupted at all. Why should it ever have become inverted ? Why should the original jet of spiritual spray suddenly get solidified into matter? To these questions, Bergson has no answer. He does not give us a satisfactory account of how, out of the original psychic force, matter comes. It is not open to Bergson to argue that matter is only a negative idea, a shadow and not a reality, for Bergson's view of negation compels him to consider matter not a pseudo idea but a definite somewhat. Vital order and geometrical order are opposed, but geometrical order is not a mere nothing. There is no such thing. as absence of order. Were it not something positive, it cannot serve the purpose of interrupting the rise of life. It cannot occasion the activity of life. So matter is a kind of being and not non-being. It is different from the being of creative activity, but it is not an illusion. But our difficulty is, how can a mere interruption of a positive process create another positive process, though of an inverse order ? In chapter iii., Creative Evoluttion, Bergson urges that intellectuality and materiality rise together. The genesis of intellect and the genesis of matter are correlative (C. E., p. 196). " It is the same inversion of the same movement which creates at once the intellectuality of mind and the materiality of things " (C. E., p. 217). But if matter takes its rise along with intellect at a comparatively late stage of evolution, then it should have been non-existent in the pre- human, i.e., the plant and the animal stages of evolution. But Bergson is emphatic that life even in its origins found matter confronting it. How then can mratter which is due to the intellect precede intellect itself? How can ma~tter both have a beginning prior to evolution to set it going and be itself a late product thereof ? We have also two view's of intellect as we have of matter. Bergson holds that intellect is the interruption of intuition as matter is the interruption of life. But there are passages where he makes out that intellect is something essential to and immanent in the evolutionary movement. It is contained in the elan vital as much as instinct and intuition. Development of the elan has been along divergent lines and intellect is the end of one line of development. Evolution has taken place on three different lines, the line of automatism exhibited in plants, the line of instinct in Hymenoptera, and the line of intelligence in</page><page sequence="10">338 S. RADHAKRISHNAN: man. The primal impulse should have had in it the promise and potency of these divergent lines. Intellect then is not an interruption or an arrest, but a definite possibility of the elan produced at one stage in its onw,ard- and upward course. It is one of the products of the creative impulse (C. E., p. 110). It is created by life. It is hard to comprehend how intellect can be both a primal tendency of life as well as an interruption of it. If intellect is something positive, even so is matter; if it is only an interruption, then matter is only that. Iv. Bergson's account of nmatter is riddled with incon?istencies and contradictions. Throughout the course of life the dualism is kept up, though Bergson has faith in ultimate unity. The difficulties we have raised in this discussion will perhaps be brushed aside by Bergson as purely imaginary ones, due to an abstract and vicious intellectualism. If we only rise to intuition and grasp things as they are, then the difficulties disappear. If we think into things, then our thoughts become one with things and the whole reality, life as well as matter, will appear to be essentially one duration. Absolutist philosophers who make the real immutable being, find it hard to account fok change; Bergson who makes the absolute duration finds it hard to account for permanence and stability. The absolutists who are mostly 'identity' philosophers reduce difference and diversity to an appearance, illusion, non-being, and irrationality. Bergson, installing himself in movement, difference, and change, disowns all permanence and identity, and dismisses them as dreams of the mind and abstractions of thought. Bergson asks us to rid ourselves,of the illusions of permanence and stability by traffscending intelligence and rising to intuition. This is just the discipline the absolutists set to us, if we wish to rise from the world of change to that of motionless perfection. The two, identity and difference, permanence and change, which are organically related to each other are exclusively emphasised and so caricatured. Berg-- son, instead of giving us a philosophical explanation of the difficulties and contradictions, exhorts us to surrender our- selves to the spontaneity of intuition. We are asked to dis- pense with all symbols, take shelter in faith, and in that attitude seize reality as it is. We then see God who is the centre of all things, the source of all evolution, who is un- ceasing, freedom, activity, and creation. A cheap and facile monism indifferent to the difficulties of rational philosophy is given us.</page><page sequence="11">IS BERGSON'S PHILOSOPHY MONISTIC ? 33$Y It is hard to see how the system is really different from abstract absolutism. In both there is one essential principle from which all things originate. Spinoza's Substance is the ens realissimum. It is the totality of all being. So is Berg- son's absolute duration. All aspects of the universe, plants, anim-als and human personalities take their rise from the creative principle. Even though Bergson calls the central principle duration, still he has as much difficulty as any abso-- lutist in accounting for change. Plato's non-being necessary to account for the finite universe, is replaced by matter in Bergson's philosophy. This non-being or matter in both systems is neither ultimate, for in that case the monism is affected, nor phenomenal, illusory or Maya, for then the play of the universe cannot be accounted for. Indications of a, more concrete idealism are not wanting in Bergson's philo- sophy. The ultimate unity is spiritual. Life and matter are assumed to have started from the same source and are recog- nised to be complementary to each other. They both co- operate in promoting the central identity. Life and matter, are the mutual implications of the original unity. Humnan life suggests to us the way in which the relative oppositionls between life and matter, consciousness and life, can be over- come in the higher unity. The individual is essentially a discord, he is a limitation of the elan vital by matter. " We are the vital current loaded with matter" (C. E., p. 252). He can attain harmony and reach the point of view of God by spiritualising the human and the finite. Intuition and intellect are not two opposed methods of grasping reality, for only a comradeship between the two can help us to a know- ledge of reality as it is. We may hope-fully await the further developm-ent of these germs of concrete idealism in future works of Bergson.</page></plain_text>
