<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY* LEWIS S. FEUER University of Vermont 1. The Scientific Principle of Simplicity. We are all acquainted with persons who seem to have a talent for making things over-complex, persons who invent exceedingly devious explanations for what can be simply explained. Such indi- viduals strike us as hardened violators of Occam's Razor: Entities are not to be multiplied unnecessarily. We shall say briefly that such persons goroptse. To goropise. The word has never come into use, though it should, since it fulfills a need. It was invented by Leibniz under interesting circumstances. Goropius, a scholar of the sixteenth century, maintained that Adam spoke a dialect of German. He tried to prove that all other languages were derived from their Teutonic prototype. Goropius' hypothesis was not unlike another wide- spread view according to which all languages originated from Hebrew. Leibniz regarded all such theories as virtual nonsense; they led into "strange and often ridiculous etymologies", with "too many leaps from one nation to another far distant without having good verifications." He added that these extremely complicated etymologies were without "concurrent evidence." Goropius' name became to Leibniz synonymous with a type of scientific malpractice (12, p. 303). To multiply auxiliary hypotheses is to goropise. 2. The Meta-Scientific Principle of Simplicity. On what grounds do we adhere to the admonition not to goropise? There are thinkers who hold that the prin- ciple of simplicity rests on a metaphysical foundation (33, p. 218). The faith that nature is governed by simple laws has been held by the greatest scientists, and is held to underlie the principle of simplicity. Newton declared that the first rule of philosophizing is "that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes" (20, p. 398). For Einstein, this faith took on an almost religious quality. The idea of mathematical simplicity, he believed, is actualized in nature (5, p. 282). "In every important advance," Einstein wrote, "the physicist finds that the fundamental laws are simplified more and more as experimental research advances" (24, p. 11). When Einstein had a new idea, he is said to have asked himself: " 'Could God have created the world in this way?' or 'Is this mathematical structure worthy of God?' Translated into ordinary language this sentence means: 'Is this theory logically simple enough?' " (6, p. 267) Now this belief in the simplicity of Nature has a long philosophical history. I shall call it the meta-scientific principle of simplicity in order to distinguish it from the scientific, methodogical principle known as Occam's Razor. The meta- scientific belief was held by Leibniz to be the principle of Divine economy: that * Received initially February, 1955. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 LEWIS S. FEUER God achieves a maximum of effects with a minimum of means. This meta- scientific creed has had an immense heuristic influence on the history of science. Under its guidance, the French Newtonian, Maupertuis, was led to the first formulation of the mechanical principle of least action. Since God achieves his effects in the most economical way, reasoned Maupertuis, there must be some function whose value is at a minimum for the actual path taken by a moving object as compared to other possible paths. Maupertuis went on to show in 1744 that both the laws of reflection and refraction of light follow from the principle that light takes the path for which the quantity of action is least. "It is this quantity of action", he affirmed, "which is here the true expense of nature, and which she economizes as much as possible in the motion of light" (9, p. 418). A subsequent memoir in 1748 entitled Les Lois du Mouvement et du Repos, deduites d'un Principe Metaphysique linked God's existence to the law of least action. To the metaphysician, Occam's Razor is simply the methodological expression of an underlying simplicity in the nature of things. This principle, says a spokes- man of this standpoint, "takes the form of the law of least action in physics. In philosophy it is known as Occam's Razor... The truth of Occam's razor de- pends on one's cosmology and not on logic" (2, p. 207). According to this view, the scientific principle of simplicity is pragmatically successful because the laws of Nature are, as a matter of fact, simple. If God had been more roundabout in his ways, then the principle of simplicity would have been of no use whatsoever. Such is the metaphysical derivation of Occam's Razor. The meta-scientific creeds of scientists differ, however, enormously. Some have rejected the notion that Nature is governed by simple laws. The naturalist, Buffon, rebutted the Linnaean classification on the ground that its simplicity constituted a slander against God (21, p. 221). Was God, he intimated so simple- minded that his creations could be grasped in so simple a scheme? The plain fact, however, is that the metascientific creed of simplicity has nothing to do with the scientific, methodological principle of simplicity. Occam's Razor, in other words, doesn't owe its validity to any doctrine that Nature is simple. This can be readily perceived with the aid of an easy imaginary experi- ment. Let us suppose that the laws of Nature are highly complex, that God, in his Majesty, has chosen to befuddle mankind thereby, reminding them of the pettiness of their intellect. Let us suppose then that the meta-scientific principle of simplicity is false. Would this in any way affect the validity of Occam's Razor? Would the complexity of Nature be a mandate to goropise? Clearly not. In every given problem, we should still look for the simplest possible solution. For every problem in our hypothetical universe, it would indeed be the case, that the simplest possible solution was an extremely complex law, but the latter would none the less be the simplest explanation of the phenomena. Social scien- tists, for instance, often hold that many variables are required to account for the behavior of social groups. To explain the complex social realities, they en- quire into the interrelations between economic, political, religious, sexual, and intellectual factors. Such scientists are as loyal to Occam's Razor as the more</page><page sequence="3">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY 11l simple-minded economic determinist, who insists that there is only one inde- pendent variable in social history. The laws which they seek are the simplest which fit the facts. They are sceptical toward the array of auxiliary hypotheses which follow in the wake of economic determinism. Occam's Razor does not presuppose the simplicity of sociological laws. The meta-scientific doctrine of simplicity is, indeed, an indeterminate creed. Though it stimulates many scientists to research, the doctrine involves the kind of extrapolation into the unknown which takes one beyond science. Statements such as "Nature is simple" are confronted by a sampling predicament when you try to verify them. If our intelligence is limited, if we are all basically simple- minded, then the laws which we shall be able to discover will be those only which are comparatively simple. "Simplicity", as Jevons remarks, "is naturally agree- able to a mind of limited powers" (7, p. 625). But we cannot infer that our sampling of laws is representative of nature as a whole. We cannot read what may be due to our mode of selection as a universal attribute of nature's laws. Residual phenomena that are unexplained by the known laws are found in every branch of science, and there is no way of knowing whether the ultimate laws which might explain them are simple or complex in form. Sometimes it is argued that the complexity of proximate laws yields in time to the simplicity of ultimate law. The various elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic, and circular orbits of different heavenly bodies were thus subsumed under Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Simple formulae of conic sections were, however, adequate to the "complex" laws in question, and their simplicity was undoubtedly one of the reasons for their early discovery. And, in any case, scientific work often takes us from simple equations to complex functions. The laws of quantum mechanics have supplanted relatively simpler mathematical formulations. Meta-scientific simplicity is sometimes held to be the limit toward which the known laws of nature converge as scientific systems approach toward complete- ness. Meta-scientific simplicity is thus regarded as an asymptote to which the sciences draw ever closer. This is indeed the view of Einstein which we have cited. We cannot however affirm that a scientific system is approaching toward completeness. We do not know whether the series of novel phenomena which science discovers is convergent in character. The advent of new and unexplained facts may perhaps be more similar to a divergent series, "so that the more we have explained, the more there is to explain" (7, p. 753). We have no way of asserting the form which sciences will take in their maturity, because there is no test for whether a scienice is mature. John Stuart Mill once affirmed that the laws of value were so well mastered that nothing more remained to be done in the subject; Lord Kelvin regarded the "properties of matter" as fully compre- hended, so that the task of physics was to fill in the details of a chart whose general outlines were known. Both made their assertions of maturity on the eve of a basic overhauling of their respective sciences. Relative to the complexity of the universe, the most mature science may be in its infancy; there is no way of telling. Speculation on futures in the history of science is a game without assign- able values. Nor do we have any way of knowing whether a science has explained</page><page sequence="4">112 LEWIS S. FEUER the maj or phenomena of its domain, so that minor phenomena only remain unexplained. The explanation of so-called minor "deviations" may require the most drastic reconstruction of the existent theoretical system. Furthermore, lew instruments, from the telescope to the mass accelerator, open up new continents of fact, and usually shatter the systematic status quo. We, therefore, have no way of forecasting in principle the direction, whether towards or away from simplicity, which the history of scientific laws will take. Consequently, any assertion concerning the simplicity of nature, as a meta-scientific principle must remain indeterminate. Knowledge is a groping process in which the direction remains indeterminate and the goal unknown. Einstein's faith in the simplicity of nature is, from our standpoint, a kind of "scientific optimism" (to use Philipp Frank's words). A decision of temperament is involved which is extra-scientific. A "scientific pessimist" will incline toward the faith that "there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." The notion of a simple universe elicits a rebellion, a claustrophobia, in some people. Whitehead's aphorism, "Seek simplicity, and distlust it", expresses the fruitful interaction of both types of scientific tempera- ment. Simple laws, we often feel, assume a constancy of conditions, which fuller knowledge converts into relevant variables. Boyle's law of gases, for example, was superseded by Van der Waals' law, which has an added number of variables and constants. But at no time are we warranted in affirming our metascientific creeds as scientific truths of the universe. Then on what ground does the methodological principle of simplicity rest? 3. Occam's Razor as a Special Case of the Principle of Verifiability. Occam's Razor, I shall try to show, is not an independent principle of methodology. It is a special case of the principle of verifiability-that no theory is meaningful un- less it leads to some observable consequence. The goropisor is a person who has embarked upon scientifically meaningless speculations. Let us consider a series of examples drawn from common sense and the sciences; we shall perceive how the principle of simplicity merges into that of verifiability. Let us suppose that Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday see the footprint of a man. Robinson infers that a man was walking on the beach. But Friday is a goropisor. He declares that the man was undoubtedly carrying someone. Robin- son replies that in that case, the footprint should have been deeper. Friday answers that probably the second man was buoyed up' by a parasol. Robinson replies there have been no winds these last days. Friday answers that probably there were brief winds just during those moments when they were not looking. Robinson replies that in that case, the open pages of the Bible he left outside should have been blown from their place. Friday answers... Friday, the goropisor, is always prepared to invent an auxiliary hypothesis to explain away evidence. A goropisor is one who is never ready to abide by the weight of a specified crucial experiment. He has a principle of theory construc- tion all his own: to generate an infinite sequence of auxiliary hypotheses rather than surrender his initial hypothesis. And an infinite sequence of auxiliary hypotheses is equivalent to an unverifiable theory.</page><page sequence="5">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY 113 Occam's Razor explains what is meant by an unverifiable theory, wherein a theory is defined as a system of related statements. An unverifiable statement is one such as "every object is now contracting to half its size." That assertion is unverifiable in and by itself. An unverifiable theory, on the other hand, is one wherein each of the constituent statements may be verifiable, but where the system taken as a whole is unverifiable. For instance, Nazi theologians proposed the hypothesis that Jesus was a German. To sustain this doctrine, they were obliged to invent a series of auxiliary hypotheses. Each member of this series was challengeable; there was no evidence, for example, of a Gothic migration to Galilee in Augustus' time. But refutation was postponed at each step by the invocation of a successor auxiliary hypothesis. Negative evidence can be indefi- nitely evaded by auxiliary hypotheses. Sometimes the series of auxiliary hy- potheses is finite in the sense that it terminates in a final unverifiable auxiliary hypothesis. But, in principle, the series can be non-terminating. The goropisor is afflicted by a tendency to methodological cancer; his principle of theory con- struction generates an endless series of auxiliary hypotheses, and thereby enables him to repress any confrontation with fact. Occam's Razor excludes a mode of theory construction which eventuates in unverifiability. The principle of simplicity is, in effect, a pragmatic challenge to the goropisor. It asks him: "Are you prepared at any step to abide by experimental decision? And if so, would you state the conditions for that test? Or are you always going to invent auxiliary hypotheses?" If experimental determination is accepted at some finite stage, the contrary hypotheses can be rejected or confirmed. We may come to believe, however, that the goropisor is intransigent, that he has made a commitment to an article of faith, and will never, in that state of mind, yield to negative evidence. The principle of simplicity defines the species of unverifi- ability which is exemplified in this ultimate defiance of scientific method. It tells the goropisor: "If this is the kind of procedure you are going to follow, scientific discussion with you is not worthwhile." In practice, of course, we are never presented in scientific research with a choice between a simple hypothesis and a rival infinite sequence of hypotheses. We are always confronted with conflicting finite systems of hypotheses with varying degrees and modes of complication. What determines our choice, as scientists, among the rival claimants is our practical judgment concerning the character of their underlying respective methods of theory construction. If we believe that the kind of procedure which a theory's proponent is using is the sort which, if adhered to indefinitely, would lead towards hypothesis-systems of infinite complexity, then we reject the proposed theory. The' hypothesis-system in question may, at the given time, contain only a small number of auxiliary complications. Nevertheless, we reject it because our practical judgment of its underlying principle of procedure is adverse; we recognize that this kind of thinking would, in the long run, lead us into morasses of unverifiable infinite complexity. The principle of simplicity in scientific research is thus not primarily a matter of counting the number of variables or evaluating the complexity of a mathe- matical function. It is basically a pragmatic judgment upon underlying motives</page><page sequence="6">114 LEWIS S. FEUER in scientific work; it discriminates between motives which welcome experimental test in contrast to those which, enthralled by an idee fixe, are compelled in a neurotic fashion to evade a decision by factual evidence. The principle of sim- plicity is a warning against the psychological repression of fact by recourse to indefinitely extensible systems of hypotheses. The debate between Malinowski and the Freudian school illustrates vividly the use of Occam's Razor in locating unverifiable theories. According to Freud, hatred against the father should be found in every culture, because the Oedipus Complex, in his opinion, is a primordial, biological phenomenon. But Malinowski found that the Trobriand Islanders were ignorant of the biological facts of paternity, and that in their matrilineal society, the son's hatred was directed not against the father but against the mother's brother. Malinowski concluded that the authority structure of the Melanesian family determined a direction of emotional response different from that of a Western middle class family. How did the Freudian school reply to the evidence against the hypothesis of the Oedipus Complex? They did not abandon their theory; they invented auxil- iary hypotheses. Ernest Jones asserted that the father was hated so much in the Trobriand Islands that his role in procreation was denied. He also said that the maternal uncle was a scapegoat for alleviating the tensions of this great hatred. Malinowski's reply to these auxiliary hypotheses is noteworthy: ". ... a complex can always be empirically reached by the practical methods of psychoanalysis, by the study of mythology, folk-lore and other cultural mani- festations of the unconscious. If, however, as Dr. Jones seems fully to admit, the attitudes typical of the Oedipus complex cannot be found in the conscious or unconscious; if, as has been proved, there are no traces of it either in Tro- briand folk-lore or in dreams and visions, or in any other symptoms; if in all these manifestations we find instead the other complex-where is then the repressed Oedipus complex to be found? Is there a sub-unconscious below the actual unconscious and what does the concept of a repressed repression mean? Surely all this goes beyond the ordinary psycho-analytic doctrine and leads us into some unknown fields; I suspect moreover they are the fields of metaphysics!" (17, p. 144). The method of goropising in this instance evolved an unverifiable sequence of auxiliary hypotheses. An auxiliary hypothesis can attain a legitimate status within science, only if it is supported by some crucial independent evidence rela- tive to its rival initial hypothesis. But no such evidence was forthcoming from the orthodox Freudian school. When the great Lavoiser made his celebrated criticism of the phlogiston hypothesis, his essential point was that it dealt with contrary evidence by means of an ever expanding series of auxiliary hypotheses (11, p. xx-xxi; 22, p. 362; 1, p. 90). "All these reflections," said Lavoiser, 'confirm what I have advanced, what I intended to prove, what I am going to repeat again, that chemists have made phlogiston a vague principle which is not strictly defined and which conse- quently fits all the explanations required of it; sometimes the principle has</page><page sequence="7">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY 115 weight, sometimes it has not; sometimes it is free fire, sometimes it is fire com- bined with earth; sometimes it passes through the pores of vessels, sometimes these are impenetrable to it; it explains at once causticity and non-causticity, transparency and opacity, colour and the absence of colour. It is a veritable Proteus that changes its form every instant." (18, p. 230). The principle of simplicity is thus a straightforward basis for rejecting theories as unverifiable. It emphasizes that a theory ceases to be scientifically meaningful if negative evidence cannot possibly at any stage be adduced against it. There are infinite sets of auxiliary hypotheses possible. Einstein, in rejecting a proposal to modify Newton's law of gravitation with an auxiliary hypothesis, remarks pointedly: "Of course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties mentioned, at the cost of a modification and complication of Newton's law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without our being able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to the others; . . ." (3, p. 127) Once we have abandoned the criterion of verifiability, nio basis for scientific choice exists. The verified theory is the simplest because every unnecessary com- ponent is an unverified item. 4. Critique of the Analogy of Mathematical Simplicity. Occam's Razor is some- times held to be a principle of mathematical elegance, of aesthetic economy. We prefer the simplest hypothesis, it is said, for the same reason that we prefer that postulate-set for a given field which has the smallest number of independent postulates. There are many postulate-sets, for example, for the algebra of logic. Some are preferred to others by the rigorous minded because they derive their theorems from a smaller number of postulates. That set which has the minimum number of postulates, or which when compared to its equals, has the smallest number of constituents in its premises, is commonly regarded as the simplest. And Occam's Razor, the quest for the simplest hypothesis which explains the facts, is said to be grounded on the same aesthetic motive which leads us to prize elegance in a mathematical system. But mathematical elegance has nothing to do with the scientific principle of simplicity. The discussion of scientific simplicity has been confused by the use of the mathematical analogy. All the postulate-sets for Boolean algebra, elegant and inelegant, are formally equivalent, that is, every postulate or theorem in one appears as a theorem or postulate in the others. The same propositions are ordered in different ways with respect to alternative postulate-bases. Each, as a formal system, is consistent and complete, and any interpretation of one will be applicable to the others. This is not, however, the case with the rival hypotheses of the scientist and the goro- pisor. Their hypotheses are not formally equivalent. They share some common consequences, but if they are different hypotheses, they will lead to some different ones as well. Rival hypotheses are non-equivalent systems; otherwise, the oper- ation of verification would make no sense. Two historians who argue about a phenomenon are not setting up equivalent interpretations. They differ with</page><page sequence="8">116 LEWIS S. FEUER respect to their predictions concerning documentary or archaeological evidence which may be discovered. Indeed, the inelegant historian, the one who knows the complexity of human motives, may tell the "truer" story than his simplicist schematic colleague. In any case, their respective interpretations are not com- parable to alternative postulate-sets for equivalent formal systems. The goro- pisor has a neurosis for evading experimental disproof. But his mechanism of self-defense is not the contrivance of a formal equivalent but rather the generat- ing of an unverifiable theory. The man Friday, in our example, was proposing that many events took place which Robinson did not acknowledge; the pro- posed sequence of events, however, was constituted with a successor chain of unverifiability. The acute Jourdain held that Occam's Razor is "the maxim that logical anal- ysis is to be carried as far as possible" (10, p. 451). According to this view, the replacement of Kepler's laws by the Newtonian law of gravitation is akin to the construction of a system with one postulate rather than three. Again, however, the mathematical analogy misses the real point of the Newtonian achievement. The fact was that Newton's law applied to many more phenomena than Kepler's laws-to the tides, to the moon's motion, to the trajectories of comets, and so on. Kepler's laws were special cases of Newton's law for planetary distances and velocities. This was not a purely formal reduction in the sense in which Nicod's postulate is simpler than the four primitive propositions required by Principia Mathematica. Newton's generalization had an empirical content far richer than Kepler's laws. Formal elegance was not the crucial factor. But don't we choose the sun as a frame of reference for the motions of the planets rather than the earth? And is not our choice of frame of reference deter- mined solely by aesthetic and practical motives, the desire to work with simple formulae rather than complex ones? And, in the light of the theory of relativity, is not our decision for a Copernican rather than a Ptolemaic system motivated essentially by aesthetic reasons? These arguments are taken as establishing the independent significance of mathematical simplicity as a principle in scientific work; the use of "simplicity" seems in this example irreducible to the principle of verifiability. As a matter of fact, however, the discovery that either a Coper- nican or Ptolemaic frame of reference can be used was an empirical one. It is an error to say, as so many text-books do, that the possibility of such a choice is much the same as the choice among alternative equivalent languages. If the principle of relativity were not valid, the earth's direction of motion would have entered into the laws of nature. The equivalence of frames of reference is an experimental, not a linguistic fact. Einstein thus emphasizes: "the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, i.e., a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This is a very powerful argument in favor of the principle of relativity" (3, p. 15-17). The theory of relativity, in other words, on experimental grounds, established the physical equivalence of different frames of reference. It set forth the appro- priate formulae of transformation from one coordinate system to another moving uniformly with respect to it. We theni do prefer to use that frame of reference which gives us the simplest formulae. But we do so only under the warrant of an</page><page sequence="9">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY 117 experimental argumient for the physical equivalence of differenlt frames of refer- ence. We do work with the more easily manipulable equations but only after this empirical demonstration of equivalence; we have experimentally shown that one system is equivalent to another. And this is an entirely different matter from re- garding the goropisor as proposing a highly complex but formally equivalent hypothesis to the one we actually choose. There is no experimental demonstra- tion of equivalence between the goropisor and the scientist. We are led back to Mills' insight that the Law of Parsimony is "a case of the broad practical prin- ciple, not to believe anything of which there is no evidence. . . The assumption of a superfluous cause is a belief without evidence;". . . (19, p. 526). A genuine use of a criterion of aesthetic elegance occurs in science when two formally equivalent systems can both be used to describe the same phenomena. Such is the case with respect to the wave mechanics of Schrodinger and the formally equivalent description of quantum phenomena by noncommutative matrices. Aesthetic and symbolic preferences, concerning which persons may differ, can assert themselves legitimately in such an instance. But the scientific principle of simplicity, applied in crucial controversies such as that over the phlogiston hypothesis, is not concerned with the respective aesthetic merits of equivalent systems. The latter are indeed alternative languages for the same phenomena, but crucial experiments are decisions of fact, not of arbitray linguis- tic choice. The goropisor wishes to create a world of pseudoscientific fantasy. 6. The Biological Basis of the Principle of Simplicity. As biological organisms, we can cope only with the verifiable. If we propose in any degree to control our environment, to plan our lives, to struggle with obstacles, we must confront the behavior of things insofar as we can learn about them through verifiable se- quences of events. As biological organisms, we must leave aside the infinite num- ber of unverifiable hypotheses. We might characterize the principle of verifi- ability as a biological a priori requirement, to which we must adhere if we are to sustain ourselves in our natural environment. And the principle of simplicity is a partial expression of this functioning of man as a biological organism. Only through its rejection of unverifiable hypotheses does Occam's Razor control the work of science. The principle of simplicity is not an anthropomorphic intrusion into science. Ernst Mach, for instance, did initerpret the principle of economy so that it verged upon the anthropomorphic. He held that science was a labor-saving device, a short-hand summation of Nature's operations which enables you to deal with situations more easily (15, p. 6, 78, 490). Occam's Razor was traced to the laziness of men, to their propensity to do things with the least effort. The "line of least resistance", formulated as a principle of scientific logic was taken to coincide with the principle of economy. Occam's Razor, from this standpoint, is a projection of laziness into scientific method. F. C. S. Schiller therefore declared that the principle "occurs to us because we have a brief span of life in which to effect our scientific purposes; to a non-human mind that was not pressed for time but disposed of all eternity it would be unmeaning or repug- nant" (28, p. 402).</page><page sequence="10">118 LEWIS S. FEUER Now there is an undeniable motivation to achieve required goals with a mini- nmum of effort. Experiments with rats have shown that they will seek their goals by spatially and temporally shorter routes, and that they probably prefer paths which involve a minimal expenditure of energy (30, pp. 110-111, 448). A prin- ciple of least effort may be a fundamental one in psychology (32, p. 19-20). Nevertheless its workings are so overlaid in various cultures by historical cir- cumstances that it does not legislate a specific mode of action. There have been cultures and sub-cultures which have prized the conspicuous wastefulness of labor. Most of us prefer a style which is simple and direct. Lyly's Euphues were a landmark of courtly circumlocution, and Moliere satirized the women who chose the most roundabout way of saying anything. Some cultures in other words, reject psychological simplicity as a norm, and in that sense, a psycholog- ical foundation for Occam's Razor becomes precarious. Indeed, a cultural his- torian might argue that the vogue of Occam's Razor is uniquely linked to the rise of capitalist civilization. As Thorburn's researches showed, the maxim of Occam's Razor, in its present form, first began to be used in the seventeenth century (29, p. 351). It appeared exactly in Clauberg's Logic, published in Holland in 1654, and was called by its proponents the Principle of Frugality or Parsimony. The ethics of the early capitalist class, if we are to credit Weber and Tawney, was one of asceticism, thrift, and frugality. Was Occam's Razor a logical expression of the Protestant Ethic, a manifestation within science of the motives towards asceticism and frugality? Mach himself said that the principle of economy was identical with the economist's Law of Thrift (16, p. 88). The principle of simplicity, however, has a trans-cultural significance. Its source is the human struggle with its environment which is common to all societies, no matter what their cultural differences. Even in a society which was predisposed to inefficiency, prolixity, goropising, and wastefulness, it would still remain true that any effort at scientific research would have to conform to the principle of simplicity. A culture can make its choice for mythology and indirec- tion; but if it does choose scientific study, it has no alternative but to adhere to the principle of verifiability and its corollary, Occam's Razor. Even if we had unlimited time at our disposal, we should still have to conform to the principle of simplicity. Otherwise we would spend eternity with infinite sequences of auxili- ary hypotheses. There are symptoms of neurosis in the behavior of the goropisor and the roundabout-man. Persons who think over-complicatedly are usually fixated upon certain institutions and dogmas. When they look upon objective facts and problems, they must at the same time bear in mind institutional dogma. The prolix person is trying, as he writes, to solve some inner anxiety concerning his ability to communicate. The more institutional fixations and anxieties he has, the more complex wilt be his way of thinking and writing. From the psycho- analytical standpoint, the goropisor and circumlocutionist are also trying to work out a simplest possible solution. But their problem is more complex, be- cause they have added unverifiables and unknowables to the equations which they must solve.</page><page sequence="11">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY 119 6. The Pseudophilosophical Principle of Simplicity. It was Bertrand Russell who, in the twentieth century, emphasized the significance of the principle of simplicity, and argued for its central importance in philosophy. All the more important it is, therefore, to see that the principle of simplicity is turned to illicit use in Russell's philosophy of logical atomism. Russell claimed that "the maxim which inspires all scientific philosophising" is Occam's Razor: Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity (25, p. 107). This meant, in practice, the principle: "Wherever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inference to unknown entities" (27, p. 362-363). The central problem of philosophy, as Russell conceived it was "the relation between the crude data of sense and the space, time, and matter of mathematical physics." The distinctive contribution of his method, Russell said, was "the whole conception of the world of physics as a construction rather than an inference" (25, p. v). It was this type of analysis which led Lenin to reject Occam's Razor vehemently as a device of "bourgeois" philosophy: "The principle of economy of thought, if made a basis of the theory of knowledge, cannot lead to anything else than idealism. That it is more 'economical' to 'think' that only I and my sensations exist-is beyond dispute, once we have introduced such an absurd principle into epistemology.' (13, p. 138). Russell's principle of constructionism, however, has nothing to do with Occam's Razor. Russell's maxim uses the language of the simplicity principle, but its significance is transformed to fulfill motives of psychological projection. A solip- sistic intent runs through much of Russell's thought. In memorable autobio- graphical passages, he has documented its origin in the loneliness and suicidal fantasies of his childhood and adolescence, and his horror at the cruelties of the political world; his free man was a symbol of solitary defiance of the tyranny of time. An emotional narcissism seems to be one underlying component of solip- sism. A hostility to other persons and the external world seems to be another. And a philosopher can do in thought what he cannot do in practice: he can an- nihilate the external world, and make its reality dependent on himself; he can turn all things into collections of his own sense-data. Such non-logical motives, Russell stated with candor, were propelling his philosophy. "It would give me the greatest satisfaction," he wrote in maturity, "to be able to dispense with the sense-data of other people, and thus establish physics upon a solipsistic basis, but those-and I fear they are the majority-in whom the human affections are stronger than the desire for logical economy, will, no doubt, not share my de- sire to render solipsism scientifically satisfactory" (26, p. 158). The motivation of Russell's maxim is not to work with the simplest hypothesis. Rather, it's an ideological projection, a standpoint which seeks a system in which narcissistic, insecurity-haunted, and aggressive drives will be satisfied. The sense of reality (to use Janet's term) can be impaired in various ways, and Russell's emotive translation of Occam's Razor is designed not to solve a scientific problem, but rather to express a highly personalized conception of "reality". Russell is therefore impelled to his own species of goropising. His underlying problem can be stated clearly: given a narcissistic dogma, how shall scientific propositions be</page><page sequence="12">120 LEWIS S. FEUER translated so as to be compatible with these basic anxiety-demands? If we would understand Russell's philosophy, we must render its unarticulated emotional premise explicit. To analyze the meaning of Russell's maxim, we are indeed compelled to psychoanalyze it. And Russell's method expresses the following: as- suming yours were the only experience in the world, and your experience the only existents, how would you express the truths of science in a way compatible with this assumption? This is a problem of rationalization, and the formulation of auxiliary hypotheses. In the latter, Russell's imagination abounds; his world of unperceived perspectives, of unsensed sense-data distributed throughout space, of electrons which are composed of sensations, and brain-atoms which are consti- tuted of thoughts and feelings-these are among the motley group of auxiliary hypotheses with which the solipsistic design to build the world out of "hard data" must be bolstered. In science, Occam's Razor is employed as a guide in the formulation of theories, and in the choice among rival hypotheses. But Russell's maxim of construction- ism is ex post facto. It is applied after the scientific work is over, as a way of "interpreting" its findings. "A moderately advanced science," says Russell, is required for the logician's activity; he is then to interpret their propositions "in such a way as to preserve their truth while minimizing the element of inference to unobserved entities" (27, p. 367). Again, this concern for a "minimal vocabulary" is rather the outcome of non-scientific narcissistic motives rather than scientific logic. As infants, we have all made the inference that there is an external physical world. The child's libidinal interests move from its self to external things and other persons. The influence to an external world is primitive and deep-rooted (23, p. 232-233). A kind of anxiety, however, characterizes many philosophers with respect to this inference. Does it arise from some early difficulty in weaning? Schopenhauer once said: "He to whom all men and all things have not at times appeared as mere phantoms and illusions has no capacity for philosophy." (31, p. 97). Schopenhauer was the despised, unwanted child of a mother with sexual ambition. And Russell has recorded the story of his own orphaned, doctrine-tossed childhood. Russell would have us undo the primitive inference of childhood, and regress, as it were, to the stage of narcissism. This is the emotive imperative which lies behind the maxim: "Wherever possible, substitute con- structions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities." The heart of science consists of inferences to unknown entities. Whether it is an inquiry into the interior of an atom or the internal constitution of a star, the theories that are proposed are inferences to unknown entities. This is the prin- ciple which Einstein has enunciated plainly: "The belief in an external world independent of the percipient subject is the foundation of all science" (4, p. 66). Science can make inferences to unknown entities, provided that it verifies the consequences of such hypotheses. To this belief, Russell's maxim of construe- tionism is opposed. Russell, in his attempt to narcissify science, is led into a mis- leading mathematical analogy. Russell regards the "data of sense" as related to physical entities in much the same way as rational numbers are related to</page><page sequence="13">THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY 121 irrational and complex numbers. Within a logical system of mathematics, the rational numbers are the elements from which other types of numbers may be constructed. But the "data of sense" are not the elements of a self-sufficient system. Scientific, inductive inference is ample witness to the fact that sense- data are taken as the terminal events of causal sequences which have their ori- gin in external, often unknown entities. The sun is never exhaustively defined in terms of our sense-data in the sense in which irrational numbers are defined by series of the system's elements. It may give one a sense of psychological reas- surance to feel that one's "data of sense" are the building-blocks of the uni- verse, but the causal relations between physical events and our sense-data are not relations of tautological deducibility. All the security which science can bring comes through the principle of veri- fiability, of which Occam's Razor is part. The "security" which Russell seeks through the maxim of constructionism is rather pseudophilosophical, a narcis- stic-bound rule of system formation, which is guided by neurosis rather than reality. In the foregoing, I have tried to show that the scientific principle of simplicity does not rest on the assumption that the laws of nature are simple. We choose the simplest hypothesis because to do otherwise would commit us to a path which leads toward unverifiable theory. The scientific principle is not one of aesthetic preference for mathematical eleganice. It is founded in the biological necessities of our dealings with the environment. If, on the one hand, the principle of simplicity is independent of any metaphysics of the universe, on the other, it does not bind us to a solipsistic theory of knowledge. Russell's maxim is an emo- tional distortion of the scientific significance of Occam's Razor. In conclusion, I might add that there is need for a political logician to do for our time what Jeremy Bentham did for his in the "Book of Fallacies." The violation of the principle of simplicity, flight into goropising, has in late years been the principal occupational fallacy of some well-known politicianis (14, p. 267). REFERENCES 1.
