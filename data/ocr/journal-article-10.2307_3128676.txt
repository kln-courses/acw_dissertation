<plain_text><page sequence="1">Keith McGowan The prince and the piper Haut, bas and the whole body in early modern Europe N his Principles of Musik (1636) Charles Butler wrote: 'The several kinds of Instruments ar com- monly used severally by them selves: as a Set of Viols, a Set of Waits [professional wind instruments], or the like: but sometimes, upon some special occasion, many of both Sorts ar most sweetly joined in Con- sort.'1 The dichotomy Butler observed had its origins in the division of instrumental music in the Middle Ages: ensembles of professional wind players who played ceremonial music were separated from those who performed music of a less function-specific but generally softer nature on stringed and keyboard instruments, and sometimes on soft wind instru- ments like flutes and recorders, and with the voice. The social separation of shawms, trumpets and drums from other styles of instrumental music had, in turn, probably been introduced when the ances- tors of the European instruments arrived from the East during the later crusades. The low social status of the aulos player in Ancient Greece had been re- hearsed in the tales and representations of the duel between Marsyas and Apollo, while the 'otherness' of musicians performing on shawms and drums is still discernible in practically every Asian and Euro- pean country where the tradition continues to be practised.2 Ottoman society described the difference between the players of the davul-zurna (drum- shawm ensemble, played for dancing) and other softer styles (usually vocal) as kaba saz ('rough', 'vul- gar' or 'low voice') as opposed to ince saz ('noble' or 'high voice'). The distinction made in European music came to focus on a paradigm of distance, one that coincidentally created a curious inversion of the difference in social status implied by the Turkish de- scription. With increasing frequency from the 14th century onwards, music was observed to be in a bi- nary opposition: the instruments and musicians of European ceremonial wind music were haut, while more intimate music became bas. This scalar, spatial metaphor seems to have been most prevalent in Ro- mance languages, and while English authors might occasionally refer to 'high and low' music,3 they would more commonly take a single aspect of the notion of haut to describe ceremonial wind music, referring to its impressive sound in such terms as 'lowde mynstralcye' or 'the king's loud pipes'.4 Mod- ern discussion in English of the phenomenon has, naturally enough, followed such historical terminol- ogy, usually referring to the shawms and trombones of haute musique as 'the loud ensemble'.5 Although volume does evidently have something to do with the incompatibility of the shawm and the harp, to reduce their inimical relationship from the paradigm of distance implied by the haut/bas dichotomy to a problem simply of 'loud and soft' is to take in only one aspect of the highly charged sense of difference surrounding the notion of haut and bas in the late Middle Ages. Mikhail Bakhtin noted that 'in medieval art a strict dividing line is drawn between the pious and the grotesque; they exist side Keith McGowan plays as a member of New London Consort, The Gabrieli Players and The King's Consort.

Butler's theoretical 'sweet Consort' of Waits and Viols shows, however, that while the Waits and the Viols remained discrete institutions, musicians of the European Renaissance could find ways to mediate the 'pious' with the 'grotesque' when necessary, if only for 'some special occasion'. Norbert Elias, whose understanding of the relationship between court etiquette and state formation might form the basis for an understand- ing of a social role for music in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, observed that 'at least in all hier- archical societies the individual's "opportunity for great achievements" that attracts the eye of the his- torian depended for a long time on his belonging to specific dlite groups or the possibility of gaining access to them'.8 I propose to expand the horizon of investigation into the piper's role in the historical process, examining the relationship and even inter- dependence between the wind player and the patrons who made such strenuous efforts to bring plebeian musicians, and particularly pipers, into their projected image of the splendid and harmo- nious community. On the need to know the high from the low Among the earliest documentary evidence of a more sophisticated style in ceremonial wind music is a mention in the Limburg Chronik of an improve- ment in pipes and piping among the musicians of the region in the 136os.9 Geoffrey Chaucer, in The Hous of Fame (c.1377), apparently provides confir- mation of the provenance of the new wind ensemble when he celebrates the international renown of 'Duche' (i.e. German and Flemish) pipers and their new dance repertory, including the Hoftantz and Springtantz (versions of the basse danse and haute danse or dansa alta), and the Regentantz (or ronde in French). There saugh I eke, famous old and yonge Pypers of the Duche tonge To lerne hove dauncis sprynges Reyes, and the strange thynges.'? The alta, which in the early 15th century might commonly comprise shawm, bombard (the one- keyed tenor shawm) and slide trumpet, or varied combinations of those instruments, represented a departure in the style of instrumental ensemble music. By introducing lower-pitched instruments to accompany the shawm, the new wind ensemble, usually playing without the accompaniment of per- cussion, was capable of more subtle harmonic effects. These new ensembles attracted attention from the second decade of the 15th century for their performance of music in 'three parts, one above the other, as one is accustomed to sing'." Such heraldic 'polyphony' might bring a solemn sense of grandeur to any important civic or court occasion. Indeed, the identification of an alta with ceremony and patron- age was so complete that it is impossible to assess fully its activity without an understanding of its rela- tionship to the power base that supported it. The 14th century presented exceptional circum- stances for a grave socio-economic crisis. A slump in the European economy at the end of the 13th century and three successive years of crop failure in 1314--16 brought appalling famine to the European popula- tion as far south as northern Italy. The plague's dev- astation of the lower classes, and the imbalance this created in the demography of all European coun- tries, precipitated a crisis in the traditional feudal view of the ordered ranks of society. It was inevitable that such social dislocation would stimulate anxiety among the privileged members of a deferential soci- ety (the chief consumers of what little music has come down to us through notastion) concerning customary feudal precedence, framed as expressions of freedom and servility, restraint and labour, grace and disgrace. Facing so many threats to their person and authority, the oligarchy in the late Middle Ages turned to their purses to confirm their seigniority through ostentatious display. The uneasy political situation in late medieval Europe created an atmos- phere where it was not sufficient to assume author- ity: any presumed rank had to be put on display.12 It was such munificent patronage that created the conditions for the development of ceremonial wind music. The seats of power could not remain aloof from these signs of dramatic social change. European courts were daily engaged in an elaborate and 212 EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999</page><page sequence="3">ruinously expensive drama through which the precedence of nobility was confirmed in a ritual of semi-staged, highly symbolic scenes of contrasted rank. This pageant accompanied all public acts of a potentate, in which the sound, appearance and even the mere physical presence of pipers and brass play- ers could be employed to enhance the patron's image. While our interest in the wind ensemble is naturally in their music, it is important, in assessing contemporary illustrations or descriptions of the alta and its role, always to bear in mind that the sound of music is only one aspect of the musician's presence in the social space. The alta occurs in the late Middle Ages as a character in a complex theatre of power, whose presence and artistic activities defer always to the figure of authority that it invariably accompanied, and whose authority it served to endorse. As one might expect, some of the customarily exclusive symbols of wealth and privilege, such as gold, silk, fine food and trumpets, played their role, though the relationship of the patron to this tradi- tional vocabulary of status symbols underwent a dramatic shift during the late 14th century. For instance, in late trecento painting a prominent use of gold and high-quality ultramarine pigment had been expected, but during the 15th century artists' con- tracts show a declining interest in the material value of the media employed.13 Although silver, precious stones and even solid gold might still be used by the quattrocento painter, material splendour became increasingly relegated to the frame or pediment.14 The new, modest style of painting practised by such artists as Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna and Piero della Francesca expressed the contrasting qual- ities of restraint and decorum.15 The artist's intellec- tual ability, his ragione or ingegno, constituted a growing proportion of the cost of such work.16 Whereas the values of the patron had once been expressed in a painting by profusion and ostenta- tion, the work now had two distinct and interacting elements: a magnificent and luxurious setting, in which a dignified representation of intellectual skill occupied the centre of attention. The two complementary princely ideals of dignity and gravity amid material wealth and extravagance were recognized by contemporary commentators, and sometimes described using such terms as maies- tate and magnificentia.17 The interplay of the acts and symbols of these two ideals characterizes so much court life and art in the 15th and early 16th century. Such a separation, together with the spatial segrega- tion of the dignified and ordered work in its gaudy frame, provide a context for a broader understand- ing of bas and haut in music. Haut and magnificence Essential to a prince's power assertion was his 'mag- nificence', a co-ordinated programme of entirely immodest acts of display, justified as a revival of the Aristotelian principle of magnificentia. The 15th-cen- tury palace was designed, in its layout and interior decoration, to leave the viewer 'thunderstruck in admiration',8 creating an impression on the visitor of the host's social standing. The palace environ- ment would also confirm the standing of any visitor relative to the host, by the path guests took into the building, the degree to which they were allowed to penetrate the increasingly private apartments, and by the manner in which they were received. Elias suggests that 'the meaning that court buildings and their design have in the eyes of the society that pro- duced them emerges only when they are seen in the context of the specific mesh of interdependence in which their owners and their circle are woven'.'9 The space of the palace allowed a notional social hier- archy to be enacted. In the presence of the potentate, the disposition of the courtiers and the furniture created a highly charged space with zones of privilege or honour in which to play out scenes of preferment (illus.1). At the high, or head end of the sparsely furnished room would be an elevated area or dais. There the chair, footstool, rug and cushions of estate for the receiving noble would be arranged, perhaps with some addi- tional seating for family and guests. Apart from the rich tapestries, only two other items of furniture were prominently arranged--the canopy and the buffet. These were insignia of the host's authority, variable in height according to the status of the owner and the solemnity of the occasion. The canopy of estate was an ornate and costly work of embroidery, drawing the visitor's eyes upwards from the person being honoured.20 The identification of EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999 213</page><page sequence="4">IIIn7 16~ PD.

The throne and its high canopy represented a physical extension of the noble's stature as the 'highest' person in the room, while offering a symbolic separation of the patron from his court. The height of the canopy above the throne could vary in accordance with the degree of solemnity of the occasion, though it was used for even minor court events like the regimen of the meal table. A cupboard or buffet of estate would also draw the eye vertiginously upwards, aiming to impress not only by the quality and quantity of items on display, but by the number of shelves on which they were arranged. For instance, whereas Cardinal Wolsey might boast six shelves on his buffet, the Tudor monarchy claimed the right to a towering cupboard twice that height.21 The buffet of estate was due the same reverence and honour as the throne setting, even in the absence of the patron.22 In its attempts to assert a sovereignty and nation- hood independent of the Kingdom of France, the Duchy of Burgundy had taken something of a lead in Europe in the establishment of rules concerning eti- quette and the interior organization and decoration of the palace. The expression of magnificentia and social rank in physical and representational arts relied on the carefully planned placement and evid- ent value or curiosity of the items to express 'mag- nificence'. Elements and ideas from these more con- crete examples of status-made-manifest were also carried over into the more abstract arts of poetry and music. French court literature of the 15th century makes particularly liberal use of the word haut, espe- cially in the context of the patron and his family. The anonymous allegorical poem Le pastoralet is typical of the hyperbole of the court ode in which the idea of 'height' proliferates in relation to nobility, their place in a social space and their actions. King Charles VI of France, for instance, is titled 'le haut pastour' or 'le haut bergier' (the 'high shepherd') and is said to be 'de haulte extraction ... de hault renon' ('of high birth ... of high renown') and lives in 'le hault bois' ('the high wood').23 Jean Molinet, poet and musician under three generations of ducal patron- age at the court of Burgundy, produces in his alle- gorical work Le trosne d'honneur a description almost as overstated as a throne room, as he tries to express the almost tangible nobility of his erstwhile patron Philip the Good, founder of the Ordre de la Toison d'Or, in images of height: Pour parvenir a ce glorieux trosne, failloit passer par noeuf cieux, ou estoient noeuf dames, noeuf preux et noeuf letters d'or, qui, coeuillies ensemble faisoient Philippus, propre nom de ceste tres haulte et precieuse fleur de noblesse le grand duc d'Occident, lequel, pour singulieres graces en luy infuses, et pluseurs haulx et grans fais chevalereux, avoit mery et deservy d'estre esleve en ce haultain trosne par dessus tous les noeuf cieulx.24 To reach this glorious throne, one had to go through nine firmaments, where there were nine ladies, nine champions and nine letters of gold which, all together, spelled out Philippus, the proper name of this very high and precious flower of nobility the grand duke of the West who, for singu- lar graces infused in him, and for several high and great chivalric deeds, had merited and deserved to be lifted up to this high throne above the nine heavens. [My italics.] It is in the context of the display of 'high' status involved in the throne setting, and particularly in dance or the dining ritual, that the alta so often appears in contemporary descriptions and illustra- tions.25 The new palace itself saw the minstrel brought, albeit conditionally, into the picture. The high, bright sounds of shawms and trumpets had long been associated with royalty and nobility, though more commonly heard outdoors or in pro- cession. The 14th century gave the new sound of a quasi-polyphonic ceremonial wind ensemble a place indoors. With the construction of new palaces as the performance areas for such display, the foot of the hall, nearest the kitchens and furthest from the dais and presence, acquired a screen and screens passage. Over this screen was often constructed a balcony or haute place draped with rich tapestries expressly to raise the heralds and the ceremonial wind ensemble above the throng, blowing the 'high acclaim' of the 1 (opposite) The 15th-century hall. On the dais sit the pat- ron's family and guests, while the patron occupies a throne beneath a canopy. In the haute place opposite stands an alta in liveried jackets of drab green with heraldic tabards, playing for the basse dance below. A buffet of five shelves is at the rear.

The late Middle Ages saw an increasing tendency for minstrels to appear with the patron within a single frame, an apparently more naturalistic representation and part of a growing synthesis of text and marginal comment.27 As with furniture that represented authority, the magnificent patron could maintain a strong identification with the alta through liveried costumes, heraldic insignia and badges of service. Analogous to the powerful symbolic separation afforded by the canopy, the haute place served to remove the alta physically from the company of the court. The patron and his wind players shared their isolation at the head and foot of the hall, yet in spite of the physical distance that sep- arated them the prince and the piper each had his place within the same hall, and within the frame of the court artist's propagandistic representations of ceremony. 'The Majestie of Princes' For the 15th-century prince, magnificentia was not an end in itself. Magnificence was accessible to anyone with sufficient money, including a growing number of the new rich. However, the chivalrous e1ite had for some time cultivated a class mystique that put a dis- tance between real nobility and the parvenu, claim- ing that 'certain grace, beauty of countenance and natural talent'.2 Such qualities, most evident in those of noble birth, betokened a majesty that placed man nearer to God. While profuse images of wealth and highness had helped to define early medieval nobility, from the late 14th century onwards tradi- tional indicators of status became merely the scenery against which the courtier could act out scenarios of difference,29 by distancing himself from the gaudy display. Such distance would not only enable the nobility to demonstrate aspects of the new virtues of magnanimity, clemency, humility and piety expected of the 15th-century ruler, but would further underline nobility's unassailable difference. During the late Middle Ages the organization of the palace itself became a physical expression of the of nobility's growing desire for exclusivity. By the 14th century, most grand houses afforded the resi- dent greater comfort and luxury in smaller, more private apartments away from the smoke and draughts of the great hall, which had once served as a multi-purpose room for the entire court.30 The continued retreat of the nobility from the public gaze created an complex performance area of ever- heightening privilege, as the visitor moved from the public arena to the palace's most private areas, in which elaborate scenes of personal and diplomatic preferment could be enacted. Just as the late medi- eval palace came to embody the values of the people who conceived it, so the dress, manners and eti- quette of the entire court could also be co-ordinated to create a heightened impression of the patron's social standing. Castiglione's treatise on successful court etiquette describes a 'lustre of nobility that does not shine forth in the low-born', and describes various scenarios in which the natural 'otherness' of the courtier can be played out. This lustre can, according to Castiglione, be made apparent by doing everything with sprezzatura or 'studied nonchalance'. It was through well-executed 'nonchalance' that the prince could show that he did not rely on work, suffered no personal allegiance, had no profession other than fighting and was a ser- vant only to God and in the Court of Love. To repre- sent a noble 'otherness', the courtier espoused per- sonal values that were, in many ways, the antithesis of the ubiquitous symbols and values of magnificen- tia. This resulted in what could be termed a show of 'ostentatious modesty', a feigned or dramatically heightened display of humility. Some of the best- established traditional symbols of authority were turned on their head in an environment that aimed to suggest a natural dignity or 'majesty'. The fashion for an etiquette of majestic restraint seems to have been promoted in particular at the court of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, 1419-67. Amid costly tapestries sewn with gold and silver thread, the duke chose to relinquish the traditional cloth of gold and silk brocade in favour of dark or black woollen clothes and only sparing jewellery. The fashion for sobriety and black clothes to indicate real nobility was endorsed by Castiglione, and later in the i6th century by Giovanni dalla Casa, for such 'external things often bear witness to inner things'.31 216 EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999</page><page sequence="7">:'P WIMM iI ii Jr vk i 0 ? .?,~ ls P Amit ?!o I?~jP. ,esd~Amok 71 i 218 EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999</page><page sequence="8">Jan van Eyck's painting of a reception at Philip's court around 1442 (illus.2) shows a most unusual occurrence in court society, for many of the custom- ary indicators of social hierarchy have been sus- pended. The fine distinctions of colour, cut and quality of cloth that usually articulate the strata of society-differentiations that urban jurisdiction was fighting to maintain-are here almost entirely laid aside for largely uniform clothes of white for courtiers, guests and servants alike. To add to a mood of 'suspended rank', the event depicted takes place out of doors, deferring the otherwise essential indicators of rank associated with the palace and the hall, such as the canopy, the buffet and the hall's ori- entation from head to foot. The traditional relation- ship of the lord to the alta is also disrupted, for in the absence of a balcony to house the musicians, they both stand on the same ground. The prince and the piper also wear very similar clothes, a remarkable assimilation that recalls the account in The Knight of La-Tour Landry of the alarming desire of the aristo- cracy to dress as minstrels,32 and serves to confirm the extraordinary nature of this scene. The palace and its hall are nonetheless represented in the pic- ture in the form of an elaborate masking house. These locations are, however, of no interest to the noble duke, who turns his back on the plate on the table, and on the vanity betokened by the peacock sunning himself on a fence in front of the ceremonial entrance. Amid splendour, the duke makes a utopian display of humility by putting aside the glo- ries he could claim by right of birth-trappings of feudal rank that are mere trinkets when seen along- side his natural majesty. The hove dauncis The hall's function as a dance floor presented an ideal, semi-theatrical space for the 'external display of inner things', and the basse dance was felt to be the test of grace and dignity in which the 'majestie of princes' could be shown.33 The mid-15th-century Ferrarese dancing master Domenico da Piacenza VANTAA BAROQUE WEEK 7-15.8.1999 Southern European Baroque Music 7.8.

I am bassadanza, the Queen of measures, and worthy of the crown. Few people have sufficient skill [lit. reason] to perform me: to dance or play me well you must be heavenly gifted.34 The notion of the dancer possessed of ragione being therefore 'heavenly gifted' is echoed in the description of Castiglione's ideal courtier who, 'whether favoured by the stars or by nature ... seems not to have been born, but to have been fashioned by the hands of some god'.35 The strict codes of prece- dence on the dance floor and dance etiquette, com- bined with the restrained steps and simple move- ments of the dance, gave the courtier an opportunity to rehearse an air of 'studied nonchalance', to which the extemporized exertions of a wind ensemble could provide a useful foil. The ensemble of hauts menestrels would blow into their instruments with puffed cheeks, while the trombonist operated the slide with characteristically violent and jerky move- ments, combining to perform magnificent and excit- ing quasi-polyphony from the balcony. The very word sacquebutte, which in France, England and Spain came to describe a brass instrument with a slide, is a composite derived from the verbs sacquer ('to remove violently') and bouter ('to shove'), sug- gesting a derisive attitude towards the dance band from the nonchalant patrons down below. The labour of the entertainer before a nonchalant patron is seen with clarity in the reliefs that adorn the Goldenes Dachl in Innsbruck (illus.3). A number of individuals appear in full figure, wearing tight- fitting costumes with slashes, parti-colouring, stripes and dagging that suggest very low or dishonourable social status. Between their legs cavort a number of dogs and monkeys, suggestive of bestial sensuality. This troupe of dancers, accompanied by pipe and tabor, hold energetic asymmetrical poses and strain every limb in a moresca performed for two groups in the centre who appear as half-figures, as if removed from this show. Emperor Maximilian appears in both groups in a flowing robe with wide sleeves that drape over the dividing parapet, his hands in a 220 EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999 ~a~kg II~1$I ~ilk~ie~i~a~hjj . -c, f?' pj .i.CC ,:i :r* :"'?: clj~ ~ -:~?:~?: c: .?? ?-i ??'j Ir -4: * ? b?IP ,3 -rl- ??~ 3 The Goldenes Dachl, Innsbruck (1494), with details of two panels: a moresca dancer and piper, and the patron with his wife</page><page sequence="10">symmetrical disposition. The scene invites the observer to contrast the dishonourable sensuality of the professional entertainer with the ease and ratio- nality of nobility. The court ritual of the basse danse offered similar opportunities for scenes of differenti- ated rank to be performed and enacted before an audience within the ritual space of the hall. The con- trasted images of the scene-the ignoble labour of the liveried minstrel / the grace and ease of the liberal dancer-allowed onlookers better to assess the dig- nity of each person taking the floor. The dance ritual suggested a vocabulary of competence in which to speak of a courtier's virtues, and gave rise to oppor- tunities to articulate the otherwise ineffable 'other- ness' of nobility. In the basse danse the alta formed the ostentatious, jewelled frame for the scene of restraint performed in the hall, a foil to the cult of majesty. ~~iKBA .?r~T~ '' ??? ~S?~ ~1 :f, .. ~5~ 'L .I i~j7 .. i;:r:~ ?~ '.ld~r~erZW~F- ~t~Wrjir;YI~.~ ::~.:' r~r ~IC~B~~ C~vv~ii; """"~""T~"ss~"""?~e~WP~~ ~C ?? :? r~~u~I~W~.aoc~Rl~iir~_~It:7 ;" ~,.,~???. t.E ~i?~?~ilY[~?'~I"~'~?~ r' C-` ~C-? ~9 -~L~ ~% ~Y~iS~i~'~!

Immoderate enthusiasm of this sort could drive you mad, which was reputedly the fate of King Sigmund, 'robbed of his reason' because of his love of alta musica.36 While the alta could be as effective as the throne, canopy and buf- fet for making an impression on the visitor, it also fulfilled a no less important function of giving the court a foil by which to express their noble 'other- ness'. Although van Eyck's fete champetre of Philip the Good (illus.2) does not take place within a hall and much of the traditional symbolism of feudal rank has been suppressed, it is nonetheless obvious that the fundamental dynamic of ritual in the hall remains, albeit using a more 'naturalistic' vocabu- lary. The ornate canopy signalling nobility is dis- pensed with; instead the duke is framed by a pair of fruit trees, as if, in the absence of vain magnificentia, nature itself would proclaim his innate majesty. The setting does not allow the wind players to be exiled to a balcony; yet the alta is still set apart from the entertainment, playing for the basse dance that proceeds down the left-hand side of the picture. Despite playing their loud, sensual dance music down among the guests, they are further separated by the fact that no face is turned in their direction. None, that is, except the heavy features of the court fool, isolated in his bright red coat, who alone pays the dazzling music of the wind band any heed. Staring from one side of the frame to the other, he seems transfixed by the puffed cheeks of the bom- bard player. His ill-advised attention misses the noble duke, but takes in the watchful gaze of Philip's hound, creating a familiar association between dance instrumentalists and the bestial (illus.4). Apparently lacking in sufficient 'reason', that appeal to the intellect that marks out man from the inhuman, the unscheduled music of a shawm capella occupies the purely sensory world of animals and the insane.37 The trajectory of his fool's stick, a parody of the Ducal dpde, also commits a faux pas by alighting on the tail of the magnificent peacock. The fool's misguided focus, concentrating on the 222 EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999</page><page sequence="11">mastiff, the peacock and the pipers, recalls the reputed descent into madness of the vainglorious King Sigmund who so loved the sound of the alta, a cautionary tale later endorsed by Sebastian Brant's pompous admonition: Keyn gut dem narren jn der welt Bag dann syn kolb / und pfiff gefelt ... Der wysen herz / truren betracht Eyn narr alleyn uff pfiffen acht The fool likes nothing more in the world Than his staff / and his pipe ... The wise man's heart / contemplates sorrow A fool esteems only pipes 38 Philip ignores the sensual extemporizations of his alta as studiously as he disregards the glories of the mock palace: leaning at repose on the table, the modest duke has entrusted his bared sword of estate to an &amp;cuyer, focusing his attention entirely on the group of courtiers before him who entertain them- selves singing polyphony from notation on a rotul- lus.39 No fool he, turning his face only to the inti- mate, rational and 'civilized' delights of bassa musica. The duke is not the only figure taking his ease. The bombard player whom the fool finds so engaging is given a pose and outfit that echo Philip's own. Lean- ing against a fruit tree, the piper stares in the direc- tion of his patron, perhaps playing the hierarchically superior tenor voice of a basse dance in tribute to Philip and the Valois dynasty. As in the hall, where the patron and his pipers occupied opposing ends of the room but were conjoined by their exclusion from the company beneath a canopy or in the haute place, so here the artist suggests a commonality between the duke and the wind player-their pose, costume and function clearly draw them together. The commonality of the prince with his pipers is confirmed by an oval badge, which only Philip and his wind players wear. The large, solid medallion worn by the alta is a valued sign of livery, the token of the piper's grateful service to the duke.40 Enter- tainers had such scildekine or escutcheons in 5 A gendered interpreta- tion of haut and bas: the image contrasts the swarthy male salaried musicians who stand outside the room-in particular a trio of pipers who labour at their work-with a female courtier with fair skin (suggesting a liberal status) who sits within, playing for her own amusement a dulcimer (and perhaps later an organetto and a harp).

As pipers and the shame-faced poor gratefully received such tokens of belonging, so the prince wished to dispense with allegiances in order to rise above the vain machinations of rank-yet Philip has an oval badge in common with the wind minstrels. What is the difference between a prince and piper? Both wear a badge and fulfil a similar function within a highly differentiated society of interdepen- dence; both enjoy the ease and leisure of one who does not work; both are indispensable, whether as the tenor of the basse danse or as the hub of a central- ized nation-state. What separates them is the degree of honour that their respective lifestyles attract. The bombard player's respite against the tree while jam- ming is a slovenly reflection of Philip's noble repose in listening to the polyphony of the amateur vocal ensemble. The musical service owed by the wind ensemble in return for livery and social acceptability confirms their terminally low status as entertainers, whereas Philip's debt is only to his peers in the pur- suance of chivalric ideals. Nevertheless, despite the social chasm that separates them, each 'serves' and play his role within one harmonious community. Even outside the hall, the presence of a wind ensemble in court ritual helps promote discourse on the nature of nobility within society, facilitating the articulation of an ideal of feudal precedence. As traditional symbols of rank are stripped away or deferred in van Eyck's representation, so the con- trast between the extemporized, waged and ener- getic music of the alta and an intimate group of lit- erate, liberal and gentle musicians has come to play a central role in a highly charged theatre of subtle distinctions-'external things that bear witness to inner things'. To one schooled in realist logic, the hall, its rituals of dance and music, and representa- tions of this drama, offered a free-wheeling play of ambiguous external signs that invited reflection on a real but unseen order. However, as van Eyck sug- gests, it would take a fool to misconstrue the scene. The successful courtier turned his back on the pub- lic magnificence of sensual dance music. Only the intellectual intimacy of basse musique was worthy to occupy the nonchalant attention of the liberal courtier.41 Basse musique and majesty Castiglione warns the good courtier against making music before the low-born or the general throng. To avoid giving the impression of working or being in service, it was vital that the company could read in a musical performance the subtle but crucial distinc- tion between one paid to entertain quite willingly, and one who will 'turn to music as though forced to do so', demonstrating skill while showing 'little esteem for this accomplishment of his'.42 By estab- lishing clearly demarcated areas and modes of activ- ity for the servant-musician and the courtier, late medieval court etiquette enabled the nobility to engage in a musical game of 'patrolling the bound- ary' between high and low. The division of music into haut and bas not only confirmed the courtier's presence in the socially sensitive sphere of practical music-making, but could even turn the astute ama- teur's endeavours into a powerful statement of social difference. The harp, psaltery and later the lute, with their plucked sonorities, became the principal amateur instruments of basse musique of the 14th and 15th centuries (illus.5). The gentle tone produced by a harpist's small and delicate physical movements is so intimate that it would be difficult to misconstrue an honourable performer's intentions, which excluded the masses as surely as the organized suite of palace rooms. By contrast, the stentorian tone of the shawm and trumpet, and even the silent iconic image of the high-held bells, puffed cheeks and lung- ing limbs of hauts menestrels in an illustration can only suggest servant-musicians who entertained the multitude in what would be considered a wholly dis- honourable fashion. The privileged space of the recently instituted chambre a' parer or 'presence chamber' was well suited to the demonstration of the exclusive musical intimacy that could be extended to honoured guests, and offered a new performance space for the court's prestige artistic activities. Even the posture of the harpist compared with the shawmist could confirm the social gulf between the noble amateur and the servant musician. In sparsely furnished rooms where being at repose confirmed a liberal status and was a privilege, the preferred instruments of 15th-century nobility-typically the EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999 225</page><page sequence="13">harp, psaltery and organetto-were somewhat cum- bersome and suggest a seated playing position, with the instrument resting in the lap. It appears that the privilege invested in the seated playing position of the amateur musician was later to become enshrined as a defining feature of the technique of the viola da gamba, as distinct from professional bowed instru- ments played on the arm or chest. To escape the stigma attached to the position of being a waged entertainer, many singer-composers, working in the restrained musical style to which nobility might be seen to turn its face, enjoyed the status of valet.43 Celebrated instrumental soloists of the period include the Fernandes brothers, blind vielle and organ players in the Burgundian domain who were both professors at the University of Paris, the lutenist Pietrobono de Burcellis, who followed his father into intimate and favoured service with the Este family as a barbiere, and the blind organist Con- rad Paumann, who died a knight. Although the ter- minology may be convenient, such a modern desig- nation as 'professional' can be applied to such musicians only with circumspection. The favoured courtier-musician might expect greater honour than could be expressed in a liveried purse of money, such as a trade patent, land or property. Thus, though the leader of the Ferrarese alta capella of Ercole d'Este was the best-paid musician at court during his tenure (c.1441-81), his wages far outstripping the salaried income of the celebrated Pietrobono, this should not be taken as an indication of the shawmist's superlative status among musicians. On the contrary, his large pay-packet, like his magnifi- cent liveried clothes, merely confirmed his status as an extremely well-paid servant, and could be taken as another marker of the distance he was obliged to keep from nobility.44 This helps us to understand better why 'professional' musicians, though they might diversify within their stratum, seldom strad- dled the boundary between bas and haut to function both as courtier- and servant-musician. The distance implied by the paradigm haut/bas reflected the social gulf between the professional wind musician and the court whom he entertained. Indeed, the professional musician had been brought into the 14th-century palace rooms to remain sym- bolically marginalized through a programme of segregation, just as the quattrocento picture might retain its gold and jewels by removing such 'magnif- icence' from the viewer's direct gaze to the frame. Rather as moral writers of the 14th century would turn to the naturalistic image of the 'whole body' to affirm the interdependence and harmonious coexis- tence of high- and low-status groups in a feudal order,45 so a hegemonic group might seek to legiti- mate itself (and its identity of nation, citizenship, faith etc.) through ritualized ceremonies that rehearsed the group's boundaries and its margins. A drama of haut and bas might be played out at court, featuring nobility and a wind ensemble, demonstrat- ing, in a defined and regulated environment, the two extremes of the social body in European society of the late Middle Ages. Outside the court, wind players enjoyed a position in society that was the polar opposite of the magnificence and majesty of author- ity. In the urban hierarchy, ecclesiastical and secular authorities stood at the top of the human chain, placing cherubim, seraphim and eventually God on their right. The litany of the prescribed social order might be imagined extending away from the king at the head of the hall, and encompassing everyone from the tiny minority of the aristocracy, down through the leaders of urban society to the artisans and labourers of the middle and working classes. In a continuous progression adjacent to the human chain, the lion marked the beginning of the order of the beasts. Balanced between the beasts and human- ity were those who were human in form alone: the insane and the disabled, alongside actors, fiddlers and pipers (illus.6, 7).

She notes that a late 14th-century copy of the Sachsenspiegel illustrates a parody of the medi- eval notion of wergeld, a material assessment of a person's worth in society.48 Various worthless (unrechte) people are depicted in parti-coloured or striped coats, though the spilluyt, with his fiddle at his back, is the only figure to bear the multiple dis- honour of a parti-coloured coat, with a dagged hem, and stripes.

Whether as the treacherous Piper of Hameln, as the 'hautboys' that in London accompany the regicide of the dumb-show in Hamlet (Act 3 scene 2), as the sackbuts and cornetts of the piffari in Mantua that conjure up an image of Hades in Monteverdi's Orfeo, or simply as in the numerous German depic- tions of disembodied shawmists, slide-trumpeters, bagpipers, fiddlers and cornettists, the image of the urban professional musician suggested a world of malevolent inhumanity (illus.9, io). Such fearful imagery derived much of its impact from a bour- geois anxiety concerning the disenfranchised and marginal social groups in its midst, focusing on the urban musician as a mere shadow of humanity. As the Sdchsisches Weichbildrecht succinctly states, as late as 1537: The ruler of a centralized nation, however, would be acutely aware of the vital necessity of the support and acquiescence of marginalized groups, and the need to foster a culture of corporate mutuality. Labourers, industrial workers and financiers stood at the root of the economic well-being of the Christian state, increasingly dependent on revenues from industrial production and trade. Charles VII was advised in c.1436: Take care, therefore, that the surfeit of money flowing to you from the aides [tribute payments], which you draw from the body, does not destroy your soul. You are also the head of this body. Would it not be a great tyranny if the head of a creature destroyed the heart, the hands and feet [implying respectively the clergy, knights and commons]?5o Outside the court the assimilation of plebeian in- strumentalists to the ceremonies of the ruling classes were often associated with ecstatic rites of corporeal identity encouraged in popular eucharistic devotion. Instrumental music was routine at the 'joyous' Spieleut und gaukler sind nicht leut wie andere Menschen, denn sie nur ein Schein der menschheit haben, und fast den Todten zu vergleichen sind.49 The entertainer and the juggler are not people like other men, but have only a semblance of humanity, and are almost comparable with the dead. .zJ V\\ a \ \ to Woodcut from Der doten dantz (Heidelberg: Heinrich Knoblochzer, 1485). 230 EARLY MUSIC MAY 1999</page><page sequence="18">public manifestations of civic order that processed through the city after Mass for the feast of Corpus Christi,5' while fiddlers and pipers excited awe at the moment of consecration signalled by the elevation of the host.52 The rapid acculturation of plebeian music traditions to e1ite ceremonies of community in 15th- century Europe concerns more than the develop- ment of instruments, the evolution of ensembles and the accretion of authorial repertory. The study of such trends of intrinsic interest to music historians is compounded, in the records of a largely pre-literate society, by a natural bias towards the preferences and prejudices of the dominant classes, inclining to a Durkheimian view of the development of instrumental art music as a site of felicitous union and integration, as if in assent to the desirability and efficacy of rites of communitas. The moment of integration for plebeian instrumental music in early modern Europe might conversely be seen as a site of social and musical tension, engaging entertainers in potentially unstable ceremonies of group identity and difference that could give way to dissent and inter-group violence. Indeed, the very rites of communion and harmony celebrated by the civic wind player's growing musical and social inte- gration associated with Corpus Christi ceremonies, the laity's access to the eucharist and Marian devo- tion, flourished on territory that would be fought over in conflicts arising from pressure for social and religious reform during the 16th century.53 The prince and the court piper, too, presented a miracu- lous synthesis of the estates that contrived an almost mystical notion of community, a union as unex- pected and 'sweet' as the consort of 'Viols and Waits'. With its polar orientation of the dais and hauteplace, the hall contributed to the creation of an anthropomorphic 'social body', the model of a highly differentiated but harmonious community. Here was the whole body from head to toe, de haut en bas. 1 Charles Butler, The Principles of Musik in Singing and in Setting (London, 1636), p.93. 2 See S.
