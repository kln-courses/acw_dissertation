Rich Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , Belgium Portable images of humans seem to be nearly ubiquitous throughout the space and time that art-producing humans have occupied. Some figurines are created to honor heroes and deities for reverential or apotropaic purposes. Some are made to recall idealized (or stylized) human characteristics for aesthetic or celebratory reasons. And some are fashioned to represent specific mortal individuals. Within this final category, there is a corpus of anthropomorphic figurines that were used, not as sculptures to commemorate or flatter based upon a visual likeness, but rather to change the course of an individual's life and separate it from the predetermined path of human fate. These figurines are distinct because they are not alone. They are accompanied by foreign materials such as inserted objects, text or symbols written on/around the form, or words spoken and actions performed about the figurine itself to imbue it with a certain power, or sometimes to take that particular power away.1 These figurines are often classified as "magical," and it is important for this study to clarify that "magical practices" typically occur outside the parameters of everyday temple worship. Ralph Merrifield defines magic as being the "use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events." Sorcery, on the other hand, is a term used to describe "an intermediate process in which the operator attempts to compel the cooperation of a supernatural being," while religious rite involves an operator who "approaches a supernatural being as a suppliant" (Merrifield 1988, 6). While the two cultures examined in this study, Haitian Vodou and the Ancient Near East,2 seem an unlikely pair for any comparison, they both employed) magical manipulated human figurines or "dolls" in order to alter an individual's destiny; however it is their differences in function, practice, and ideology that will prove to be most illuminating.3 While the extant magical figurines of the ancient Near East are given a priority placement in Europe's most highly regarded museums,</page><page sequence="2">The Face of Lafiva: Vodou &amp; Ancient Figurines Defy Human Destiny 263 the figurines of the Vodou world are still misrepresented, misinterpreted, and misunderstood. These figurines, their fashioners, and their functions should be highlighted as are figurines from other parts of the world and other religious contexts (Brown 1995a, b). If this were the case, there would be no confusion as to the fact that the dolls of Vodou are not meant to alter destiny by completely harnessing an individual's free will, but rather to manipulate the individuals (particularly the self) involved in the processes of healing and protection from further disorder. Unfortunately, incorrect ideas are prevalent even in academic scholarship. For example, expert on Egyptian magic, Geraldine Pinch, compares one repeatedly- impaled figurine (ca. 200-300 AD; see Louvre statuette below) with those of the Caribbean; however, she does so based upon popular notion instead of ethnographic reality. Regarding the figurine's interpretation, she deduces, Drawing on parallels from European witchcraft or Caribbean voodoo, the obvious assumption is that this figurine was intended to kill the woman depicted or to cause her severe pain.4 This "parallel" is in fact a tangent. The parallels for this figurine would better be found in the textual evidence of dolls fashioned in Assyria rather than a transcontinental diachronic approach that grossly misinterprets "Caribbean voodoo." Dolls of Destiny in Vodou Historically, western perspectives of African and African-based belief systems have largely been based on a fear of black subversion through occult powers, and by maintaining this image, it has been possible "to contain African phenomena within the parameters of imperial, colonial, and neocolonial power and ideology" (Pels 1998, 194). Europeans and Euro-Americans often view the spiritual objects of Africa and the diaspora as being imbued with a fascinating secrecy and, at the same time, hidden forces that threaten the order of western civilization. Taking this popular fascination into consideration, some may be surprised to learn that "voodoo dolls" do not exist (Davis 1985: 254; Tippet &amp; Bellegarde-Smith 2008: 153). Whatever they are supposed to be is a false notion propagated by 1950s Hollywood horror films that removed very real objects from their authentic contexts to exoticize and fictionalize beyond recognition. During the mid-20th century, cashew nut dolls were exported from Haiti en-masse to the United States to satiate the American desire for exotica. This consumerist desire proved fatal when, in 1959, the U.S.</page><page sequence="3">264 Sara A. Rich Public Health Service issued a warning that the dolls were in fact lethal (Clar 1959). The dangerous effect of the dolls had nothing to do with any associated function - spells, demons, or "black magic"; it was actually a result of the materials used and subsequently misused by the American public. The dolls were being fashioned out of cashew nut shells, with little eyes of jequirity beans which contain a liquid similar to the toxins in poison ivy. When swallowed by infants, the result could be serious injury or death. This government warning served to increase fearful stereotypes and false images of Vodou in general, but it did not waive the consumer interest in "voodoo dolls" in particular. Anywhere Vodou is openly practiced, the dolls are mass-produced as souvenir trinkets and sold to the unwitting tourist as kitschy tokens, supposedly representative of a very foreign culture and belief system (Fandrich 2005, 200). They come complete with little pins and daggers, something like what the character of the Maharaja used against Indiana Jones in The Temple of Doom, In reality, small cloth figurines are created as a part of Vodou rituals; however, their function has nothing to do with inflicting physical or emotional pain upon an unfortunate - or deserving - recipient. Much contrary to the popular misconception, these figurines are meant to heal, not to hurt. As the Vodou adept does not openly distinguish between physical and psychological pain, the functions of the figurines might range from maintaining open lines of communication with the dearly departed to binding or dissolving love affairs (Brown 2006: 2-3; 1995a: 205-226).5 When used for a liaison with the deceased, the desired magical outcome is actually reflexive. Figurines do not lure the deceased into communication with the living, but rather, the living fashioner of the figurine becomes more receptive to the wisdom of ancestral spirits. The person whose destiny is to be altered is none other than the doll's designer. To the Vodou adept, or servant of the spirits, just as physique and psyche are inseparable, an object cannot be divorced from the actions surrounding it.6 For example, handmade cloth dolls have no power unless they are completed by knotted strings tied around them, hung from trees in cemeteries, upside down to dissolve the relationship or right-side up to ensure its health. They may also be bound together with string, facing each other to fasten the relationship or facing apart to end it (Brown 2006, 22; Brown 1995a, 220; Rich 2008b, 74). If the object stands alone, without the performative aspects, then it is just a cloth doll like any other. The transfer of power from individual to object must occur in a precise manner before the object has the ability to alter the path of destiny. Figurines or hand-fashioned dolls are also found on the Gulf side. Recently in Florida, a troop of St. Petersburg Boy Scouts discovered</page><page sequence="4">The Face of Lqfiva : Vodou &amp; Ancient Figurines Defy Human Destiny 265 cloth dolls hanging from a fallen tree during a clean-up exercise of Greenwood Cemetery (Ave 2008). Appealing to an ancestral spirit, the small figurines were hand-sewn and pinned together for binding, and their anonymous creator(s) secured them to the tree with now-rusted nails through the sternum, perhaps attempting to heal a broken heart, to maintain a romantic relationship, or to break off ties with a former lover. Similarly, the home of the late Gyp Packnett, a southern Mississippi man not lacking in spiritually-imbued creations, hosted two manipulated dolls conspicuously nailed to the door. The smaller one had a disproportionately large plastic doll head and two red ribbons for legs, giving her lower body a lucid, transitive appeal. The larger doll was also formed by a plastic and cloth body, but she featured a toy revolver hanging around her neck, among various bead necklaces. The dolls served an apotropaic function through the addition of various extraneous objects, which in turn serve as metaphors for communication and protection. Thompson describes these dolls as "fugitives from a Kongo passport to the other world" (Thompson 1993, 95-96, pl. 96). The process of hanging figurines on trees, in cemeteries, and on doors is an essential aspect of the Vodou concept of human destiny. All of these locations are seen as portholes: trees connect the underworld with the earthly realm, cemeteries connect the living with the dead, and doors connect the interior with the exterior. As do the human participants of Creole culture, these small yet powerful figurines have many of their roots in west and central Africa. The taproot may be the Figure I. 19th - 20th century Kongo nkisi nkondi. Note the smaller dolls attached to outside of this nkisi .

Rich nkisi nkondi figurine, made by community healers and diviners to change an individual's path as drawn out by the spirits. Still employed throughout the Yoruba and Kongo diaspora, mnkisi are usually small men made of wood with a womb holding an ancestral spirit (who resides in graveyard dirt held within) and other objects of power: hair, feathers, bones, herbs, glass, and metal (Fig. I).7 As the nganga (priest-exorcist-healer) drives nails into the wooden figure, evil is driven out of the suffering person, alleviating the individual of his/her pre-determined ailment, whether heartache or toothache (Thompson 1983, 1993).8 Like the more modern Afro-Caribbean versions, they often have objects of power tied to them, indicative of spiritual metaphors that cannot be separated from the object (Thompson 1993). Even considering the potency of the anthropoid figurine, mnkisi themselves are powerless to alter man's fate without first appealing to the spirit called Ellegua, the keeper of the crossroads, gateways, and every language spoken by man (Mellor 1992). A popular Vodou adage states that "all things are related and one: coincidences are not a part of the script."9 While the fate (or Fwa) of humankind is pre-determined to Vodou adepts, there is allowance for both determinism and free will. As Carter maintains, the Haitian Lwa (or spirit), "Legba is capable of introducing change and accident into the affairs of men [and women] and thus is able to break the iron law of fate" (Carter 1962, 263). Legba is the Haitian version of the Yoruba Ellegua, also associated with crossroads, doorways, and portholes, the facilitator of communication in all realms. He travels constantly down the long roads, walking stick in hand. One must appeal to Legba in order to change one's own path. Divination is possible because of Legba, and this Lwa alone is responsible for changing the stream of fate into a tributary of tendency. Another Haitian adage states: "Divination is possible because the future is knowable in the form of tendencies; time wraps around itself." In a cyclical universe such as the one recognized by the Vodou adept, space-time is not linear, but circular, even continuously pivoting around itself in the shape of a spiral (Crosley 2006). If one, such as Legba, can unwrap space-time, s/he can foresee patterns of behavior, cause and effect, thus becoming capable of both predicting and altering the future. In this belief system, repetition is inevitable, and there is an emphasis upon the sameness of the strange and the familiar. Reverberations are constantly felt, even consciously felt, inspiring re-visitations of the past and future, thus enabling the prediction of both order and chaos, as opposed to the dictation thereof. As Carter further explains, "By virtue of Legba's role and man's ability to reach and persuade Legba, a [wo] man's destiny becomes a tendency - an orientation or disposition. Without Legba, man is like Oedipus inextricably caught in</page><page sequence="6">The Face of Lafiva: Vodou &amp; Ancient Figurines Dejy Human Destiny 267 his fate. With Legba, [wo]man can be free" (Carter 1962, 263-264). Thus, Legba is the deification (or Iwa-fication ?) of the human ability to assert free will. As a popular Haitian song asserts, "We control our own fate, / We control everything!"10 The context of Vodou figurines echoes long-founded spiritual beliefs and the understanding of the human condition that originated in Africa, transported and transmuted via slave boats to the Americas and the Caribbean islands. Likewise, similar principles and modes of interpreting (and thus manipulating) human existence in the ancient world are recognized as having originated in the Near East, then transported and transmuted via merchant ship to the Greek and Roman magical systems. As Ogden states, "the process of magical borrowing between ancient Mediterranean cultures and the development of some sort of magical koine between them may have been aided by internationally itinerant professionals (Ogden 1999: 79-80). In analyzing the magical practices of the ancient Near East, there lies a possible explanation for the popular misconception of Haitian "voodoo dolls." Manipulated Miniatures in Mesopotamia and Egypt Figurines for ancient magical practices were made of various substances including wax, clay, tallow, wood, and dough. Of these materials, only a small sample of clay and wax figurines has survived into the archaeological record. Fortunately, we also have textual evidence surrounding figurines made of less-durable materials and those that were intentionally destroyed to illuminate their presence, and just as importantly, the extraneous objects, words, and actions that empowered or disempowered them. To empower these objects, as in the Vodou examples cited above, the creation process had to be imbued with spiritual conception, and the activities surrounding them also had to be enacted in a precise manner to appeal to those beings that controlled human destiny. In order to disempower these figurines, they were often burned and melted or submerged in water, thus undoing whatever previous power they may have originally held, or activating the words and performances surrounding them to extinguish the power of the individual represented in the figurine. During preparation, they were often manipulated with other materials or techniques, such as written text over the form (especially the name of the individual), or the insertion of metal, bone, or shell. For the following study, it is essential to understand that in ancient Semitic thought, the name, the being, and the representation were all equally powerful (Weil 1978, 68). With that being said, the easiest way to disempower a person would be to destroy what is most accessible of the three - the representation.</page><page sequence="7">268 Sara A. Rich To bind a lover in Greco-Roman Egypt was to employ very sinister disempowering techniques. Two figurines were fashioned from clay or wax, with the male brandishing a sword pointed at the right side of the female's neck. Various inscriptions were then written all over the bodies, and then the practitioner must: take thirteen copper needles and stick one in the brain while saying, "I am piercing your brain [insert name of victim]," and stick two in the ears and two in the eyes and one in the mouth and two in the midriff and one in the hands and two in the pudenda and two in the soles, saying each time, "I am piercing such and such a member of her, [insert victim's name], so that she may remember no one but me, [insert name], alone." The practitioner must then tie 365 knots in the thread that binds the figurines together with the curse inscribed on a tablet, all the while repeating, "abrasax, hold her fast." Finally, as the sun is setting, the bundle with figurines must be placed beside the grave of someone who has suddenly died, untimely or violently, along with a bouquet of seasonal flowers {PGM IV, 296-334).11 Two extant examples of manipulated figurines from late-antique Egypt turn the above love charm into something disturbingly tangible. The Louvre Museum houses the first and more graphic example. This terracotta female figurine was carefully crafted with her hands bound behind her back and feet bent back and bound beneath her. There are thirteen nails driven into the body: head, eyes, mouth, ears, chest, hands, vagina, anus, and the soles of her feet (Kambitsis 1976; Pinch 1994, 90- 91, fig. 48; Ogden 1999, 75-76, fig. 4). She was found inside a clay vessel or coffin together with a lead tablet containing a binding curse from Sarapammon directed toward her victim of love, an apparently unwilling partner named Ptolemais. Although the tablet indicates it was a woman pursuing a man in this case, the sex of the doll was not altered to fit this scenario (Pinch 1994, 91). Perhaps by keeping the sex of the object female, it served to increase the "vulnerability" of the victim. By creating this figurine and performing the proper actions around it, Sarapammon's doll was intended to take away Ptolemais's free will, rendering him helpless against her "charm." The second example, located in the British Museum, is another female figurine formed by building up wax around a roll of papyrus that is situated like a cursed spinal column within the doll (Figure 2)(Pinch 1994, 90-91,</page><page sequence="8">The Face of Lafuoa: Vodou &amp; Ancient Figurines Defy Human Destiny 269 figs. 46 &amp; 47; Ogden 1999, 72, fig. 5). A lock of the recipient's hair was pressed into a hole at the navel to ensure an accurate delivery. As the binding curse above dictates, the figurine was discovered in a tomb, the action of which is indicative of a certain Egyptian and Mesopotamian ideology. The dead resided in the underworld, so by placing the anthropomorphic figurine in a grave, the practitioner appealed to an immortal for assistance in harnessing the powers to perform this supernatural deed. In a particular Mesopotamian curse on what seems to be an individual's fertility, figurines in the likeness of the man were buried in the ground to make him impotent (Geller 1999, 54; see Abusch 2002, 79-88 and MaqlÃ» below). Like Afro-Caribbean practitioners, Egyptian and Mesopotamian magicians considered liminal space when burying their figurines. A similar example lies in the caches of Mesopotamian apotropaic figurines of hybrid creatures and deities interred beneath thresholds, in corners, and under windows (Nakamura 2004; Braun-Holzinger 1999, 152-157). By activating a direct channel through the earth to the underworld (apsu, or the underground lake) where these beings existed, the effectiveness of these figurines was magnified exponentially.12 Alter-fated lovers, or those who attempted, were not the only ones afflicted by these destiny-diverging figurines. Although more closely related to sorcery than to magic, wax and clay figurines representing enemies of the Egyptian state, such as Nubians in the Old Kingdom, were ritually destroyed in private ceremonies within major temples (Pinch 1994, 92-94; Ogden 1999). This act of melting wax or breaking Figure 2. Wax curse-binding figurine from late-antique Egypt.

Rich clay figurines removed the aggressive power of any potentially dangerous usurpers, rebels, or resisters to pharoanic superiority. Likewise, in the "Sefire" inscription from Assyrian Aleppo, a treaty is declared between two kings, and in a manner of "pinkie-swearing" to the genuine intentions of each, the following incantation was stated as the outcome of breaking the treaty: As this wax is consumed by fire, thus [I] shall be consumed by fire. ... As a man of wax is blinded, thus [I] shall be blinded.13 In this way, the oath is reflexive, the king swears on his honesty that he will follow the outlines of the treaty, or his destiny shall be altered to match that of the waxen doll. In the following Assyrian example, the text describes a curse from one king onto another: Just as one burns a wax figure in fire, dissolves a clay one in water, so may they burn your figure in fire, submerge it in water.14 Rather than the figurine and its curse being reflexive, in this case, the figurine represents, and ultimately dooms, the rival king. The Akkadian Namburbi texts (8th - 6th c. BC) provide examples of dolls or figurines that were used to counteract the effects of another magician's efforts to alter an individual's fate, thus reinstating the will of the Gods (Caplice 1974; Ogden 1999, 80-81). To undo or avert portended evil, the practitioner employed a figure of wax or tallow with the name of the hostile magician inscribed on the left hip. The figure's arms were theri twisted and bent behind the back, feet were bound together, and the figurines were finally buried, as to lay to rest the intentions of the ill-meaning sorcerer, termed the "Hand of Man" (Stol 1999). Often the ritual required the entire process to take place at a liminal site, such as a gate, roof top, river, or canal bank to ensure a reversal of the curse (Caplice 1974, 9-10). Similar lead figurines with bound limbs from the Jewish-Palestinian sites of Tell Sandahannah and Marissa (2nd - 3rd c. AD) yield such reversal inscriptions in Greek, one of which declares, "I bind Philonides, son of Xenodikos. ... Let Philonides, rendered harmless and incapable of harming others, be forever voiceless and destitute" (Gager 1992, 203-204). Although the second line of this reversal curse negates the destructive powers of the magician, the third line makes him not only harmless, but also completely helpless.</page><page sequence="10">The Face of Lafiua : Vodou &amp; Ancient FigurÃ¬nes Defy Human Destiny 27 1 Likewise, in a set of nine Assyrian tablets entitled MaqlÃ» , or Burning Rituals (1st mil. BC), techniques for revenge against witchcraft involved magical figurines that represented the enemy, created along with particular incantations and performances to disempower them (Abusch 2002, Ogden 1999, Nakamura 2004, Faraone 1993, Hillers 1983). In a typical early curse from the MaqlÃ» texts, we have the following example of averting portended malevolence by incorporating human statuettes: Figurines of a warlock and a witch . . . you fashion. You raise them up in your hands, and he recites this incantation three times .... When he has recited it three times, you place the said figurines in a half -sila container, sprinkle them with fish oil, and burn them. He recites the incantation, I raise up the torch and burn your statues three times, and in water he flattens the figurines of clay and flour with his feet. You bury [the remains] in an uninhabited place.15 As the incantation was spoken, Girra the fire-god was invoked so that the wax figure melted, the clay figure torched, and the dough figure charred (Abusch 2002, 68-69). The remains were buried in an uninhabited place, again to invoke the powers of liminal space, but also to deny the magician access to any realm occupied by other humans. In a final act of destruction and humiliation, the statuettes could also be fed to the dogs: "May eagle and vulture prey on your corpse, may silence and shivering fall upon you, may dog and bitch tear you apart, may dog and bitch tear apart your flesh" {MaqlÃ» VIII: 81-89). Another possible outcome for the witch as victim of a MaqlÃ» is to have the harm deflected back upon her and amplified until death. This action temporarily exchanged the fate of enemy with that of the enactor, then finally extinguished the enemy's powers and existence altogether. Consider this example: Dawn has broken; doors are now open; the traveler has passed through the gate; [the messenger] has taken to the road ... For I am now cleansed by the rising sun, [and whatever] witchcraft [you d]id or had done (against me during the night), may they (the traveler, the messenger) turn back (against you) so that they [the curses] seize you yourself!16 After the burning figurines are extinguished with water, the incantation continues: "With water of the deep I then quenched your heart and extinguished your spirit." All these actions were performed so thoroughly in order to reverse the victim's fate back to its original status, prior to the</page><page sequence="11">272 Sara A. Rich magician's initial manipulation. This is exemplified by the final incantation at the end of the ceremony, "By pure Ishtar who illumines fate, I have been designated for the design of life" ( MaqlÃ» III: 180-181). Although these incantations and the accompanying figurines seem to be in an effort of vengeance or equalization of good and evil, the incantations do not will a diminishment of the powers alone of the sorcerer/ess, but also the individual's demise. Furthermore, one must consider that the witch (or kaÅ¡Å¡apu) would not likely have chosen a victim at random. Rather this initial act of witchcraft was probably also an attempt at equalization of good and evil in the alleged victim. Consider for example the previously described impotent man who blamed a witch for his reproductive malfunction. Because witches were usually identified as female, it becomes quite clear how the cycle of revenge-witchcraft-revenge could easily occur (Abusch 2002, 87). Considering this point, it seems that the punishments outlined on this and other curse tablets for Assyrian offences are rather capital.17 In the Babylonian creation story Enuma-elish , Marduk created humans, wrought with ill-fate, from his own blood and bones in order to be servants of the Gods (Tablet VI, 1-10). In Enki and Ninma (52-111), we read that the divine couple used clay to fashion the first human beings, and they came into existence complete with all sorts of afflictions at the whim of the Goddess Ninma who determined the fate of each wretched being. In other words, the gods created mortals from clay and breathed life into them to become living vessels, housing spirits of their own but whose will is still determined by the divine (Nakamura 2004; Heidel 1949, 138). Makers of these magical figurines as described above are thus imitating the legacy the divine; employing mimesis, they created miniaturized versions of themselves, then transferred instructions and power onto the object, while ominously maintaining control over it. To destroy the representative object meant the destruction of the name and soul of the person. This is the fate that mankind was given by the gods, that men were/are/will be mere "extensions of divine will and rule" (Nakamura 2004, 22). As for Vodou adepts, Mesopotamian ideology also allowed for a divergence from this predetermined human condition. While the deity Enlil controlled the determination of fate and destinies ^Namtar" or Å¡imtu in Akkadian), Enki controlled the equilibrium and natural order of things ("mÂ¿," comparable to the Egyptian ma'at). The prescribed destiny, Namtar , was accessible and malleable through acquisition of the Tablet of the Fates, possessed by Enlil (van Binsbergen &amp; Wiggerman 1999, 20-23). Knowledge of holism and magic, such as was practiced by the diviner-physician-conjurer ( aÅ¡ipu ), allowed one access, even if temporary, to Namtar (Scurlock 1999).</page><page sequence="12">The Face of Lafiua: Vodou &amp; Ancient Figurines Defy Human Destiny 273 In this ability was the power to dictate the actions of inanimate objects so that they operated independently from their predictable patterns; thus, "the hegemonic rule of the gods appears not to be completely secured against the forces of reaction" (van Binsbergen &amp; Wiggerman 1999, 23). As in Afro- Caribbean societies, the fashioning of Mesopotamian figurines to change human destiny, for better or for worse, was one way that certain individuals could take control of their own fate and manipulate that of other persons. Conclusions Admittedly, I am not the first to draw a line of comparison between Haitian Vodou and the ancient cultures of "western civilization." Louis Maximilien and other historians of Haiti compare Vodou to the cosmology of polytheistic Egypt and the mysteries of the ancients. Maximilien states the following in the opening of a chapter entitled " GenÃ¨se Vodouesque " or The Genesis of Vodou, Vodou is a religion constituted of various ancient rites, organically linked by metaphysical ideas, still alive in Haiti, bearing ancient traditions which can be illuminated by ancient texts concerning the Egyptian mysteries and even the works of Herodotous.18 Perhaps these ancient texts and extant figurines do not enlighten us about Vodou, as Maximilien would have preferred, but rather they can inform us on our perception of Vodou. Those of us embedded in Euro- American culture are also embedded in its history, which includes, among many other things, a few thousand years of the menacing magical figurines described in these ancient texts and anthropoid manifestations verified by the archaeological record. As has been suggested, "To abandon the concept of magic with regard to ancient Mesopotamia would mean rejecting a historical usage which has persisted over the past two millennia" (van Binsbergen &amp; Wiggerman 1999, 9). For all their similarities in form and function, there is a recurring discrepancy between the examples of figurines from the world of Vodou and those from the ancient Near East. Contrary to popular opinion, the dolls made by servants of the Haitian Lwa are typically benign in nature, willing a change in the fate of romantic relationships, the dynamics of communication, and domestic security, divorced from violence. Like the mnkisi figurines from the Yoruba diaspora, the objects are meant to interfere with fate in order to heal, not to harm. From the Mesopotamian, and better-known late-antique Egyptian examples, dolls and figurines used for crafting destiny were often of a more destructive nature. The</page><page sequence="13">274 Sara A. Rich human forms were burned, buried, drowned, or melted to disintegrate the powers of lover and enemy alike, if not to extinguish the life thereof. These tendencies have echoed throughout past generations of Hellenic, Jewish, and Christian magical practices (van Binsbergen &amp; Wiggerman 1999, 10), and perhaps they can explain why Europeans and European- descendent Americans presumptuously assigned such a malignant role to the small cloth figurines used in Afro-Caribbean religions. In the wake of "western civilization" and its ancient legacies, perhaps these assumptions are only a transposition of what was already remotely familiar. In effect, the macabre characterization of Vodou figurines turns the foreign back into the familiar, while maintaining a latent and lingering (colonial) fear of the objects as yet another example of "black" magic. Notes 1 For example, I have suggested that two terracotta figurines depicting parturition from Neolithic Malta (during its indigenous period) illustrate this same kind of manipulation for apotropaic reasons on behalf of individual pregnant females (Rich 2008a). 2 A version of this paper was written for presentation at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Schools for Oriental Research. Because the conference was held in New Orleans, this paper is meant to inform archaeologists and historians of the Ancient Near East on an aspect of Vodou that the two belief systems share. Because the presentation is for an audience with experience in the Near East and the publication is for an audience with experience in Haiti, I have attÃ«mpted to write for both perspectives. 3 Other parallels have been drawn between the belief systems of Vodou and those of Hinduism, Native American and Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and Neo-paganism (Tippet &amp; Bellegarde-Smith 2008, Pizza 2006). 4 Pinch 1994, 90. 5 Similarly, there were few binaries in the ancient Near Eastern societies, and it is argued that there was no distinction made between physical, social, spiritual, and psychological complications, so they resulted in the same symptoms and were treated in the same manner (Stol 1999, Scurlock 1999). 6 The poto mitÃ¡n in Vodou is the center-post of a temple ( hmmfo ), perhaps somewhat similar in function to the Asherah pole of the Canaanites. Although any pole can be used, its potency does not diminish if the pole is merely imagined - the actions surrounding the object (tangible or not) are what make the space sacred (McGee 2008: 35; Rich 2008b, 75-81). 7 I am aware of the seeming contradiction of a male figurine possessing a womb; however, the African and Afro-Caribbean systems allow for few dualities,</page><page sequence="14">The Face of Lafiua: Vodou &amp; Ancient FiguÅnes Defy Human Destiny 27 5 including male /female (Conner 2005; Rich 2008b). For example the Lwa under current discussion, Yoruba-derived Legba, also has male and female characteristics - the poto mitÃ¡n (see above, footnote 6) is seen as his phallus, while the space around it is as his womb (Conner 2005: 145-146; Desmangles 1992: 108-109). Androgyny and bi- or homosexuality seem to be common among the spirits, and are therefore not shunned by those who serve them. 8 Thompson (1983, 117)(1993, 48) among others (Brown 1995a, b; Cristophe 2006) associate Haitian paqÃ¨ts kongo (decorated gourds with objects placed inside) as de-anthropomorphized mnkisi figurines. 9 Personal communication with Patrick Bellegarde-Smith (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, February 19, 2008). 10 "Magique Marasa" by Papa Wawa and Azore (1993), as translated in Houlberg 2005, 13. 11 Betz 1989, 44-47; see Martinez 1991, 30-32 for commentary over another example of a love binding curse from the Michigan Papyri of the Third-Fourth century AD. 12 In these purely apotropaic examples, pictorial representations of the portentous object is not necessarily important, and human images are rarely used (Caplice 1974, 11). 13 Faraone 1993, 62., from F. Rosenthal, in Pritchard 1969, pp. 659-60. 14 "The Vassal Treaties of Esarhaddon," E. Reiner, in Pritchard 1969, pp. 534-40; see also Faraone 1993, 63. 15 AnaÅ¡Å¡i diparu I: 135-143. 16 MaqlÃ» VII: 170-177. Note the presence of the "cosmic traveler" in this incantation (Abusch 1999, 127), which appears (disputably) to have a similar function as Legba, the Vodou Lwa of communication, crossroads, and gateways, who is also visualized as a perpetual traveler. 17 Ritual ex-voto offerings to Gula, the Mesopotamian goddess of healing, sometimes also came in the form of human figurines, the particulars of which have not yet been published and have been excluded from this discussion (Braun-Holzinger 1999, 150-151). Additionally, these figurines would not necessarily be considered as magical, as they were used to appeal to a goddess in a temple situation, thus linking them more closely to rituals of sorcery or religion (Merrifield 1988). 18 From Maximilien's Le Vodou HaÃ¯tien: Le Rite Radas-Canzo (1945) as translated from French in McGee 2008.
