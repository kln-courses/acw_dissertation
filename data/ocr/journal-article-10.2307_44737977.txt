Ambrose and Christopher Culbert NASA Johnson Space Center Copyright © 2004 SAE International ABSTRACT NASA's Human Space Flight program depends heavily on spacewalks performed by pairs of suited human astronauts. These Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) are severely restricted in both duration and scope by consumables and available manpower. An expanded multi-agent EVA team combining the information- gathering and problem-solving skills of human astronauts with the survivability and physical capabilities of highly dexterous space robots is proposed. A 1-g test featuring two NASA/DARPA Robonaut systems working side-by-side with a suited human subject is conducted to evaluate human-robot teaming strategies in the context of a simulated EVA assembly task based on the STS- 61 B ACCESS flight experiment. INTRODUCTION For many people, the lunar surface excursions of the Apollo program epitomize the human spirit of discovery. A critical component of long-term space missions, Extra- Vehicular Activities (EVAs) are also part of the goal. Spacewalks and extraterrestrial surface excursions provide the means to assemble, maintain and repair complex space and surface systems while exploring unknown worlds. The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest and most complex space structure ever flown. A stunning achievement in orbital assembly, the program highlights NASA's heavy reliance on EVA to connect services, configure external equipment and perform routine maintenance. Unfortunately, EVA operations demand much preparation, consume significant crew time and pose a bottleneck to processes that depend on them. Risky, expensive and complex, EVAs are restricted in both duration and scope by consumables and available manpower. Operations are planned for two astronauts working an 8-hour EVA day. Future space science platforms, vehicles and infrastructure will continue to face these EVA resource management problems. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was carried into orbit in 1990 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS- 31). Newer, high focal length designs, like the proposed FAIR (Filled-Aperture Infra-Red) telescope, are too large and flimsy to launch as a single pre-integrated assembly. Instead, components of these space telescopes could launch separately and rendezvous in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for assembly, deployment and final repositioning [1], These and other larger, lighter, more extendable space structures will require greatly expanded EVA and Extra Vehicular Robotic (EVR) capabilities as well as new and innovative structural systems.1 MULTI-AGENT EVA TEAMS Teamwork is important during space operations but especially crucial during EVAs due to the elevated risk to both personal safety and spacecraft integrity. Good communication between EVA team members is essential so they practice specific operations together on the ground extensively, spending 8 hours in simulated EVA for every hour of planned EVA time. The typical EVA team includes not only the two astronauts (denoted EV1 and EV2 in NASA terminology) who egress the airlock, but also Intra-Vehicular (IV) crew members and ground controllers. An expanded multi-agent EVA team pairing human astronauts with advanced robotic helpers can address the need for augmented capability and increased productivity. Today, these machines can be used to project dexterous manipulation capabilities to the worksite, allowing remote humans to participate in EVAs in new and meaningful ways. In the future, robots may be able to perceive their surroundings, make informed decisions and solve problems on their own. Recognizing the versatility and vulnerability of human astronauts, the multi-agent team is designed around them. Astronauts lead the team and each team member 1 The FAIR telescope assembly concept is included merely to illustrate the need for multi-agent human-robot teams but is purely conjectural in light of current NASA policy, which limits the role of the Space Shuttle to an International Space Station support vehicle in the interest of maximizing crew safety. 1105</page><page sequence="2">supports their activities in some way. Robotic helpers are designed to interact safely and efficiently with them. EVA tasks are planned in such a way that they leverage the astronauts' superior situational awareness, sensory feedback and manual dexterity. The recent emergence of highly dexterous space robots dramatically expands the opportunities for humans and robots working together in space. These machines can help conserve EVA hours by relieving human astronauts of many routine chores and assisting them in more complex tasks. Robots can take risks unacceptable to humans, perform contingency EVA operations in minutes, instead of hours, and setup worksites in preparation for the arrival of human astronauts. ROBONAUT Recognizing the opportunity to augment human presence in space with highly capable machines, the Automation, Robotics and Simulation Division (AR&amp;SD) at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) is collaborating with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a humanoid robot called Robonaut (Figure 1). In its simplest form, Robonaut is a teleoperated master-slave system in which a human teleoperator becomes the robot master. The anthropomorphic form of the robot allows an intuitive, one-to-one mapping between master and slave motions. Because Robonaut is designed to work with and around humans, the human-machine interface is central to the high-level control system design [2], which also incorporates distributed autonomy and learning modules. Figure 1 . Ground-based Robonaut testbed Robonaut's considerable mechanical dexterity allows it to use EVA tools and manipulate flexible materials much like a human astronaut would. About the same size as the EMU spacesuit, Robonaut can go wherever a suited astronaut can. By meeting these requirements, the Robonaut project leverages NASA's enormous investment in tools, procedures, and workspaces for spacewalking astronauts. Although the challenges of designing robots for space and terrestrial applications are very different, two 1-g Robonaut systems were built at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop and test control strategies. A wide array of tools and interfaces have been successfully handled in the course of testing the Robonaut system's capabilities [3]. Humans interact with Robonaut in one of three roles including EVA human, teleoperator and ground controller (Figure 2). This interaction takes different forms depending on the configuration of the human- robot team and the degree of autonomy exercised by the robot. While the remotely located teleoperator and ground controller exchange mainly information signals with the robot, the EVA human is actually present at the worksite and can interact with the robot in a direct, physical manner. Robonaut is equipped with force and tactile sensors to sense these physical stimuli as well as motors to act upon them. When a human is present at the worksite, the teleoperator has the opportunity to interact physically with him/her via the robot. From the EVA human's point of view, interacting with a teleoperated Robonaut is much like interacting with another human. Figure 2.

Four human test participants assume prescribed roles as members of a multi-agent team featuring two NASA/DARPA Robonaut systems working side-by-side with a suited human subject to build an erectable truss on a rotating assembly fixture. Integrating some of the latest technology advances in high-mobility spacesuits, dexterous robots and modular structural systems, the Multi-agent Truss Assembly Test demonstrates new EVA capabilities enabling orbital assembly of large space structures. Figure 3. STS-61B astronauts Jerry Ross and Sherwood Spring building the ACCESS truss in the Orbiter payload bay OBJECTIVES Key test objectives include: • Demonstrate supporting capabilities applicable to in- space assembly using existing technology prototypes and 1-g test beds. • Develop teaming strategies for EVA astronauts working side-by-side with highly dexterous, teleoperated robots. • Study the operational trade-offs inherent in human and robot teaming in a space assembly context. The Multi-agent Test was conducted to exercise collaboration modalities within a multi-agent team, not to assess the feasibility of a particular EVA task. The focus of the activity was to economically learn as much as possible about how heterogeneous teams of collocated and remote humans and robots can work together in space using available hardware and test beds. DESCRIPTION The Multi-agent Test is based on the STS-61B ACCESS flight experiment in which two EVA crewmembers built an erectable truss on an assembly fixture in the Space Shuttle payload bay (Figure 3). It features two Robonaut systems working side-by-side with astronaut Nancy Currie, wearing the experimental l-Suit, to build the Langley Cubic Truss in 1-g (Figure 4). Robonaut is an anthropomorphic robotic system capable of using tools and handling mechanical interfaces designed for humans. The l-Suit is a high field of view, high mobility, lightweight prototype soft suit developed by ILC-Dover. The Langley Cubic Truss is a stiff, lightweight structural system designed for EVA assembly. Truss assembly is facilitated with a low-fidelity, rotating assembly fixture and other supporting equipment. Figure 4. Multi-agent Test initial configuration, as seen by Ground Controller via Mini AERCam Working together, the two humanoid class robots (RV1 and RV2), controlled by remote human teleoperators, serve in various roles supporting the astronaut (EV1), who operates as team leader. A ground controller (IV1), stationed at a simulated mission console, is tasked with directing the EVA over a wireless communication system and dictates the procedural details to each of the assembly agents. An emulation of the Mini Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic Camera (AERCam), a free-flying nanosatellite outfitted with video cameras, is positioned adjacent to the worksite, providing the ground controller with a "bird's eye" view of the worksite and assembly team during the course of construction. Initially, the truss consists of a single cubic bay, which is translated up along the assembly fixture to make room for the addition of a second bay beneath it (Figure 4). The struts forming the truss are housed in two quivers 1107</page><page sequence="4">located near EV1 and RV1 while the nodes are contained in trays. These two assembly agents unstow struts and nodes from their containers and cooperatively assemble them to form segments. EV1 then attaches these segments to the truss. The third assembly agent, RV2, rotates and stabilizes the assembly fixture as needed. The assembly procedure requires a high tier working position to mate connections along the top edges of a truss bay as well as a low tier position to access the bottom edges. This also allows the astronaut to interact directly with both robots, though not at the same time. Once all the high tier connections are locked, EV1 translates to the low tier position, beginning the second half of the task. To complete the truss bay, RV1 unstows struts and passes them to RV2, who, in turn, transfers them to EV1 . EV1 then attaches them to the truss. Once all the low tier connections are locked, the truss bay is structurally complete and the team begins installing an umbilical cable terminating in EVA electrical connectors around the exterior of the truss. An EVA cable tie caddy is first unstowed and passed from RV1 to RV2 to EV1, who attaches it temporarily to the truss. Next, the umbilical is unstowed and routed around the truss to EV1, who plugs the connector into a waiting socket on the assembly fixture. As EV1 rotates the fixture, RV1 and RV2 uncoil the cable and hold it in place against the truss, allowing EV1 to apply a cable tie at each corner. Once all the cable has been deployed and secured, EV1 plugs the remaining connector into a second socket on the assembly fixture. At this point, the assembly task is complete and task time stops. As an extension of the basic assembly task, related EVA support skills were demonstrated. After the team had finished building the truss bay and installing the umbilical, for example, RV1 performed a "buddy check" on EV1 to inspect her spacesuit for simulated hydrazine propellant contamination. A mix of manipulation and teaming skills are required to complete the truss assembly task. Truss assembly agents must not only be capable of mating nodes and struts, they must also be able to coordinate cooperative manipulation, hand-offs and other multi-agent interactions in the pre-planned assembly sequence. The topics explored during this initial investigation include collaboration modalities between EVA and remote humans and skill mappings of dexterous robots and human workers. Timeline optimization is an important aspect of EVA planning examining both workload distribution between crewmembers and the sequence of tasks to be performed. The overarching objective in planning the activity is to employ the human EVA crewmember(s) as safely and efficiently as possible, thereby conserving consumables and limiting exposure to the hostile space environment. RESULTS Testing was performed over the week of 6/15/03 in the Dexterous Robotics Laboratory at JSC. Suited activities were limited to approximately one hour per day by the finite supply of bottled breathing air. The testing period provided sufficient time to accomplish the test procedure with allowances for both human error and unexpected non-critical system degradation. Five suit runs were performed over the course of five consecutive days but extensive planning, preparation and reconfiguration took place between runs to continuously improve the assembly team's performance. Test procedure details were kept flexible from day-to-day to build a rich experience base in human-robot teaming. Each individual run, however, was well structured and planned with a fixed procedure in place. Through judicious allocation of responsibilities, each team member (EV1, RV1, RV2 and IV1) was utilized as efficiently as possible. One objective was to minimize the amount of time that EV1 spent waiting for the other agents to complete prerequisite steps in the procedure. In this multi-agent team, EV1 is, without a doubt, the most valuable and most capable team member. As the only human directly exposed to the hazards of the space environment, EV1 is also the most vulnerable. Therefore, EVA hours should be more heavily weighted than EVR/IV hours in the timeline optimization, even at the expense of EVR/IV efficiency. Using robots to prepare an EVA worksite before the human arrives is an example of how EVA time can be leveraged with EVR capabilities. For analysis purposes, the task is divided into two halves separated by EV1 translation from a high tier position to a low tier position. As appropriate for a human-centric team, subtasks were categorized according to the activities of EV1 into four categories (Tables 1 and 2). The timeline breakdown according to EV1 activity with subtask descriptions is included in the Appendix (Tables A1 and A2). Table 1 . Cumulative timing results - 1 st half of task 1108</page><page sequence="5">Table 2. Cumulative timing results - 2nd half of task In the first half of the task, EV1 was positioned at the high tier position. EV1 spent more time working alone (485 seconds) than in any other single category (Table 1). During this time, robots RV1 and RV2 performed support functions (Table 3) but did not interact directly with EV1. The remainder of the time was evenly distributed between working with RV1, working with RV2 and waiting. Table 3. Subtasks in which robots support EV1 indirectly RV1 support functions RV2 support functions 1st Half of Task open cover on short strut quiver, node tray unstow short strut, tri-node (Figures 5a, 5b) 2nd Half of Task unstow short strut RV1 transfer short strut to RV2 (Figure 5c) unstow cable tie caddy, umbilical cable RV1 transfer caddy, umbilical to RV2 In the second half of the task, EV1 was positioned at the low tier position. EV1 spent more time working with both robots (482 seconds) on umbilical installation than in any other single category (Table 2). The percentage of time EV1 spent waiting was about the same as for the first half of the task. To utilize EV1 more efficiently, assembly task planning should be adjusted to eliminate as much EV1 idle time as possible. Subtasks in this category are shown in Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix. Additional efficiency may be gained by improving interaction between EV1 and the robots. Subtasks in this category represent critical teaming skills and are presented in Table 4. Generally, only skills requiring communication with EV1 are listed as teaming skills, even though several of the support functions listed in Table 3 require communication between the remote human teleoperators controlling the two robots.

The cluttered, unstructured test environment and complex component geometries inherently make the assembly task difficult for robots. Only a handful of robotic systems in existence can even form the grasps and execute the motions necessary to assist humans in this way. Of these, only Robonaut is designed and optimized to work in space. Figure 5a.

RV1 and RV2 manage the umbilical cable as EV1 rotates the truss (teaming skill - 2nd half of task) OBSERVATIONS In order to complete the assembly task within the EVA window allowed by EVTs breathing air supply, much of the workload fell on the astronaut. Although the robots were capable of performing nearly every subtask on their own, they would have taken more time. In order to be practical, the multi-agent team must be able to perform its task in less time (as measured in EVA astronaut-hours) than the conventional team consisting of two astronauts. An interesting exception is the multi- agent team consisting only of collocated robots and remote humans. Depending on the particular EVA task in question, there may be other considerations as well, such as risk mitigation and physical limitations. Spacewalking astronauts have a very limited field-of- view restricted to the window in the EMU helmet, which does not swivel with neck motions. In general, two astronauts working side-by-side on an EVA cannot see each other. They are unable to communicate through body language or gestures and cannot anticipate each other's actions through observation. By necessity, EV1 and EV2 communicate almost exclusively by radio, employing very methodical handshaking to confirm mutual understanding. For similar reasons, participants in the Multi-agent Test developed a wireless headset communication protocol to help them function as a team. The EMU encumbers the body motions of an EVA worker. Spacewalking astronauts have a restricted working envelope dictated by the EMU range of motion. The EMU glove also degrades the tactile sensing of the wearer. To a degree, the degraded tactile feedback and manual dexterity suffered by the human subject wearing the spacesuit and performing the task adjacently parallels the sensorimotor handicap suffered by the human controlling the robot and performing the task remotely. CONCLUSION The Multi-agent Test should be understood as part of a continuing effort to study how humans and robots can work together effectively in space. At the same time, these experiments test the limits of robotics and teleoperation, demonstrating new EVR capabilities and the feasibility of performing more tasks telerobotically. Higher-fidelity tests involving more sophisticated gravity compensation and more realistic mobility, communication time delay, lighting conditions, etc. will complicate some operational aspects of EVR but simplify others. The multi-agent team featured in this test represents only one particular instance of humans and robots working together. It represents a novel integration of existing technology prototypes and test beds intended to meet test objectives but should only be interpreted as part of the solution to increasing EVA capability and productivity. More diversified multi-agent teams, improved EVA technology and new vehicles will all be required to meet future needs. REFERENCES 1.
