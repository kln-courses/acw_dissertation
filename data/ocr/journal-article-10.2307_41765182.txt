Top: "Ich und Du" CI and Thou). Below: "Das Reich des Zwischen" (The Realm of the In-between). At the end of the 1950s, one of the topics emerging almost obsessively among Team 10 members, in conferences and periodicals, was that of the "threshold," also called the "meeting place," or the "shape of the in-between." Aldo van Eyck's theory of the threshold or the in-between - a dis- course on the need for architecture to reconcile spatial polar- ities such as inside-outside - was first proposed by the Dutch architect in 1959 at the CIAM 11 in Otterlo. Van Eyck elo- quently illustrated keywords and leitmotifs, such as das Reich des Zwischen (the realm of the in-between), or la plus grande réalité du seuil (the profound meaning of the thresh- old), with photographs of traditional habitation, showing, for example, dignified children sitting on a one-stepped ter- race leading to a mud-constructed abode in some unidenti- fied tropical area. Aldo van Eyck (and of some of his friends) developed a theory of the threshold by borrowing from an array of heterogeneous literature that included pop- ular Western metaphysics. Aldo van Eyck was also one of the first designers to introduce considerations on "primitive" architecture into his discourse. He cites, for instance, the writings of Franz Boas, one of the first ethnolinguists to focus on the unconscious nature of cultural phenomena, and to situate the locus of such structures within the realm of language, thus becoming an inspiration to the French intel- lectual movement termed "structuralism." Van Eyck's archi- tectural school is often ambiguously defined as one of Strukturalismus , which appears to have been a reference to the doctrine of linguistic structuralism. In order to under- stand how this term came to be associated with van Eyck's work one must map the context of various trends leading to an "anthropologization" of architectural discourses in the 1960s. Taking into account the recent scholarship that has cast new light on the figure of van Eyck, perhaps there is the «</page><page sequence="2">Right and Opposite: Aldo van Eyck, "Otterlo Circles," first SHOWN AT CIAM 11, 1959.

The story of how this concept entered the work of van Eyck begins in theologian Martin Buber's notion of "das Gestalt gewordene Zwischen" (the in-between that has taken shape). In recent years, Francis Strauven has demon- strated van Eyck's connection to Buber's work, based on texts published in van Eyck' s magazine Forum ,i In various issues of Forum , the theme of the "threshold" was theorized by both van Eyck and Joop Hardy, citing Martin Buber's def- inition of the sphere of the in-between as the "bearer of inter-human events."2 Similarly, in Buber's 1951 Urdistanz und Beziehung, a book on "original distance" and relation- ships, art is defined as the "witness to the relationship between humans and nature." This relationship would form the basis of van Eyck's notion of a spatial dialectic, which was to be achieved by incorporating the reality of "dual phe- nomena." With things having been arbitrarily divided by the emphasis on efficient production in the technological age, the dual phenomena* offered a basic principle that provided for a twin reality in which things would find a reconciled Gestalt: the threshold.4 Buber, a philosopher of religion, a theologian, and a 34 1.

Such an ontology of the interval, or the "between," is a philosophy of inter subjectivity.5 Buber's thinking is based on real communication between human beings, hence the emphasis on dialogue as opposed to monologue, which he characterizes as a Zmesprachey a "dou- ble speech" of the given and the received. This is a prelude to the double tonality of the soul's "exhalation" and "inhala- tion" - or, we might say, its inspiration.6 In the now famous 1960 issue of Forum on "Door and Window," van Eyck would develop the concept that the in-between must be conceived "in the image of man," and that like man himself, the in- between must "breathe both in and out."7 Such a respiratory idea is repeated, conjuring "the breathing image" of archi- tecture, to ask the vital question: "Man still breathes both in and out. When is architecture going to do the same?"8 This is an image taken from Buber, inasmuch as the physical act of breathing consists of an inhalation followed by an exhala- tion. These breathing images refer to the response of the / to the ThoUy a pneumatic system that offers not only the occa- sion of respiratory metaphors, but also the foundation of a theory of the human spirit, the f neuma (in Greek, breath, spirit). Such is the dialogical force of relation. 35 5. Gabriel Marcel, "I and Thou," in The Philosophy of Martin Buber , eds.

Quoted by Strauven.</page><page sequence="4">For Buber, there are two levels of relations between the subject and the world, consisting on the one hand of "I-It," and on the other of "I-You" or "I-Thou."9 In his ontology, the world of objects, which is defined by the "I-It" relation, appears as a separate entity, a relation that leads to a world of disconnection. The introduction of the "I-Thou" dimension, alongside or below that of the "I-It," creates a mysterious, quasimystical, and subjective force: the double fold (Zwiefalt ) of the I. The Zwiefalt is a bifurcation of the self, established by the dual structure of a totality (I-Thou) together with the multiplicity of separations (the I-Its). To some, the privileging of the Ich -Du duality raised some doubts, which were formulated by Buber's collaborator, Franz Rosenzweig, who thought that while Buber's recogni- tion of the role of the "Thou" was groundbreaking, it was at the expense of the "It."10 Buber's "anthropology" is funda- mentally the relation between man and man, a meeting or happening, an occurrence that defines the sphere of the between, of the inter-human (das Zwischenmenschliche), which unfolds as the "dialogical."11 Buber calls the interval between I and Thou the Zwischen (in-between), which he sees as the locus where being is realized.12 Because it is always novel and newly experienced, this meeting takes the form of a constantly renewed occurrence. It is distinguished from the silent dialogue of the mind, and unlike the mind, does not happen in an abstract space. In Buber's pure spiritualism of friendship, one might ask if the interval, or the in-between, is not revealed by the consciousness of the relation , which he calls either the Beziehung (relationship) or Umfassung (enclosure, totality). The philosopher apparently doesn't offer a clear indication of how a state of relation differs from a state of conscious- ness; moreover, in his work it is difficult to distinguish a relationship from an idealistic, pure conscience. Because man deals with the real world, one must define not only the terms of a spiritual dialogue but also the possibility of a sepa- ration between the individual and the whole. As Lévinas wrote: "[Buber] has not taken separation seriously enough."1* Even if Buber's idea of between-ness functions philo- sophically as a category of being, "Man" is still its locus. Having distanced himself from the anonymous world of things, Man is put at the center of being. Thus, Buber's phi- losophy can be read as an anthropology, and this is probably why it so easily permeates the readings of architects like van Eyck during the 1950s and 1960s. As Michel Foucault would later make clear, "anthropology" does not refer to the study 36 9. Jean Wahl, "Martin Buber and the Philosophy of Existence," in The Philosophy of Martin Buber , 493. 10. In other words, Buber doesn't do jus- tice to the "It," to the things of the world, because he still thinks within the schema bequeathed by western meta- physics, which tends to capture man's place in terms of object and subject, when ontologically "being" should not be conceived as an object for man, nor beings should not be reduced to the sub- ject-object relation.

Emmanuel Lévinas, "Martin Buber and the Theory of Knowledge," in The Philosophy of Martin Buber , 133-50. As Emmanuel Lévinas remarked, Buber accords the intersubjective aspects of the I-Thou ( Ich-Du ) relation a privileged status, but the meeting is not just con- strued as a meeting between human beings and things, but also as a relation- ship with God. The original distance (Urdistanz) that penetrated the between- men sphere also invades the territory "between God and men." 13.

"Anthropology," which puts Man at its center, was not an invention of a 16th-century scholar during the Renaissance, but a biased manipulation of French and German historians during the late 19th century.14 One could ask how this ontology of between-ness could translate into an aesthetic, or an architectural theory. To begin to formulate an answer, one has to return to Aldo van Eyck's famous text in the "Door and Window" issue: "Whatever space and time mean, / Place and occasion mean more. / For space in the image of man is place, / And time in the image of man is occasion."15 As Strauven remarks, for van Eyck, "space" is turned into "place" by being construed "in the image of man," and since man is dual and dialogical, a place should be too. This operation is a "similarity," which is to be understood in a "structural" way: for van Eyck, a building should present a structural analogue to the human being, and include anthropomorphic pairings, such as breathing in and out, front and back, spirit and body.16 The source for this is again in Buber's thinking, who referred to the theory of imitation - mimesis - in the arts. For Buber, as for van Eyck, while man is made in the image of God, space is made in the image of man, and, accordingly, architecture begins to function in a system of imitation, with each level of the similarity, or analogy, "imitating" the next: from the scale of the theological to the anthropological. Since the Greek canon and Yitruvius, an intrinsic aspect of the Western tradition has been to embed human propor- tions in a building. Buber's source seems located in the many references to architecture made by the Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas: what the architect is to the building he erects, God is to the world he creates. Aquinas called the comparison between the realms of the divine and created worlds an "analogy." An analogy enables an appeal to the community between the divine and the created world, dis- playing what they have in common, while preserving their incomparable difference. For Aquinas, the analogy of "God / architecture" shows that the architect is actually an ana- logon of the created world, not so much in terms of harmo- ny and proportions, but inasmuch as architecture bases itself on causes and principles that are imposed and felt through- out the whole of creation.17 Many 20th-century architects, including van Eyck, based their "theory" on a modern version of Aristotle's mimesis and Aquinas's analogy. Through Buber's popular- V 14. Michel Foucault, Dits et Ecrits /, 1954- 1975, eds. Daniel Deferí, Francois Ewald (Paris: Gallimard, 2001), 467, $68, 1094. 15. Forum n. 3, 1960-61, 121.

An exam- ple of this "metaphysics" is van Eyck's belief that the work of art, whether concrete or abstract, is to be considered through its representative capacity. It consists of an appear- ance that refers to a reality that serves as a model. It is an active form (morphe) imposed on passive matter ( hyle), fol- lowing the Aristotelian tradition of hylemorphism. Van Eyck's theory stands by the Buberian aesthetic regime, which in turn is aligned with Aristotle's "poetical" represen- tation: the oeuvre is both mimesis praxeos (imitation of an action) and mimesis physeos (imitation of nature), thus caught in the long chain of resemblance and similarity that would be repeatedly taught by the scholastic tradition.18 (One might add that while there were "structural" analyses and critiques of mimesis in rhetoric, literature and the visual arts in France during the 1960s - by Roland Barthes, Gerard Genette, and Louis Marin - Aldo van Eyck and his contem- porary critics seem to have known nothing of them.) Aldo van Eyck's metaphors for space are based on a metaphysical onto-theology. Space, as it were, becomes the receptacle and fundamental meeting place for all humans. Instead of focusing on spatial antipodes, such as the harsh forms of postwar modernist urban developments, architec- ture ought to develop itself as a dialogical entity - that is, a dual or "twin phenomena" - that brings the dialectic sides into contact, and reconciles their opposing forces. It is an architecture of reconciliation. Space and time, created "in the image of man," become place and event. There is an affinity between the notion of place and the notion of the in-between, both taking place between the polarities of inside and out- side, here and there, small and large, part and whole, house and city, form and structure, and so forth.19 Indeed, the whole oeuvre of van Eyck, from the Municipal Orphanage (Amsterdam, 1958-60) to the Pastor van Ars Roman Catholic Church in Loosduinen (The Hague, 1968-69), is embedded in anthropomorphic references and shaped by a poetry of between-ness. It is perhaps possible to view the nave of the Via Sacra, cutting through the two main parts of the van Ars Church, as a precise illustration of Buberian in-between the- ory. For van Eyck, space in the image of man signifies that modern architecture must interiorize through its very form(s) the "perceiving, moving and relating subjects." In this way, buildings are "brought to life by their inhabit- ants."20 Such an assertion is an excellent statement, but one 38 Aldo van Eyck, diagram of Pastoor van Ars Church, Loosduinen, The Hague CThe Netherlands), September 1965, AND DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING THE "TWIN PHENOMENA," 1965. 18.

If an interval is opened up within space, creating a place and offering an event, is such a hiatus to be defined by "things" (inside/outside, large-scale/small-scale, house/city, etc.), by "subjects" (humans, divinities), or by both? With van Eyck, as with Buber, one is left with a sense of dissatisfaction about the definition of the Zwischen , as it fluctuates from the phys- ical realm of things to the subjective domain of meeting places for people or inhabitants. Some answers are offered by early 20th-century ethno- logy, specifically the work of Arnold van Gennep, whose Rites of Passage (Paris, 1908) describes the different phases of the process of initiation in various societies. In chapter VI, for instance, he focuses on natural features that mark a terri- tory, such as a stake, a portal, or an upright rock (in other words, a milestone or a landmark).21 He describes types of thresholds in a village, a town, a house, or a temple: "The door is a boundary between the foreign and domestic worlds in the case of an ordinary dwelling, between the profane and sacred worlds in the case of a temple."22 To cross a threshold, van Gennep adds, means uniting oneself with a new world. It is thus an important act in marriage, adoption, ordination, and funereal ceremonies. More generally he calls the rites of separation from a previous world preliminary rites (from the Latin, prae, before, limen , threshold or limit), those per- formed during the transitional stage, liminal rites, and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world, postliminary rites. He cites, for instance, the isolated portal in the city that gives rise to monuments such as the Roman arch of triumph. In another instance, when passing through a door, orthodox Jews must touch the mezuzah with a finger of their right 21. Arnold van Gennep, The Rites of Passage , trans. Monika B.

The volume is still of great interest and describes the different phases of the initiation process in various societies through different rites, including exclusion (rites of separa- tion), marginalization (rites of initiation), and the subse- quent reintegration of the individual into the group (rites of incorporation). Van Gennep was widely read, among others by Walter Benjamin, who drew from Rites a theory of the "passage" in Das Passagen- Werk (The Arcades Project ), an exploration of the urban world through the figure of the Parisian arcades during the 19th century. Benjamin remarked, for instance, that the gate belongs in a context with the rites de passage , an allusion to van Gennep's title. He also collected notes from Ferdinand Noack, who studied the iconology of passing under triumphal arches ( Triumphbogen ). For Noack, this "passage" was one of escaping a hostile element, or separat- ing off the spirits of the dead. Benjamin applied this analysis to the threshold of the Parisian arcade, noting that "whoever enters an arcade passes through the gate- way (Tor- Weg) in the opposite direction," that is, he travels back into the ghost world, venturing "into the intrauterine world."2* Benjamin also read Karl Meistert study on cults of domestic thresh- olds ( Hausschwellen ) in ancient Rome. Benjamin returns to van Gennep' s volume: " Rites of passage - this is the designa- tion in folklore for the ceremonies that attach to death and birth, to marriage, puberty, and so forth. In modern life, these transitions are becoming ever more unrecognizable and impossible to experience. We have grown very poor in threshold experiences."24 This is a consideration that will lead to a theory of Schwelle (threshold), conceived not as a border but a zone that can be inhabited. 25 Benjamin called for a "science of the threshold," which entailed the perilous art of inhabiting limits, being acquainted with lines, and set- tling in borderlines. Such a liminal state makes it urgent that a cartography of the threshold is drawn, which includes its "immediate tectonic and ceremonial context."26 Nobody had access to Benjamin's Arcades Project at the time, but van Gennep's Rites was well known, especially after the I960 English translation. Joseph Rykwert, a Polish- born British scholar, was familiar with van Gennep, and was also an acquaintance of Aldo van Eyck. Rykwert had known van Eyck from Ulm's Hochschule fur Gestaltung, and van Eyck would become the first editor to publish Rykwerťs study on "The Idea of a Town" in an issue of Forum in 1963 . In an analysis of foundation rites of antiquity, Rykwert quoted van Gennep in several instances in descriptions of 21. Walter Benjamin, The Arcades Project , trans.

Furthermore, the rites that were enacted during the establishment of cities and temples, as well as the division of land in four parts, the ceremonial ploughing, and so forth, were aimed at the reaffirmation of a state of equilibrium, balancing cosmic opposites, the recon- ciliation of which was to be inscribed on the land and com- memorated by rituals of recurrent festivals. In Rykwerťs "The Idea of a Town," one realizes that he relies on a whole set of dissimilar sources, published between the 1930s and 1940s, that give a divergent meaning to his essay: namely, the mythologies of Carl Gustav Jung (with Karl Kerenyi); the Indo-European mythography of the French philologist Georges Dumézil; the volume on the mystical symbolism of the cupola by the French academic Louis Hautecœur; and the history of religions by the Romanian Mircea Eliade, a professor at the University of Chicago. Jung, the famous founder of so-called depth psy- chology, will develop the theory of archetypes, undertaking to study those patterns by the exploration of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico and Arizona in 1924-25, and attempt- ing to determine their nature in Gnosticism, folklore, and the literature of alchemy.28 In 1941, Jung will publish his Introduction to a Science of Mythology, together with the Hungarian-educated Karl Kerenyi, a professor of classical philology. Interestingly, the young Aldo van Eyck attended the lectures of Jung, who was a professor on the Faculty of Philosophy and Political Sciences at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich from 1933 until 1942.29 An interest in the theory of archetypes is confirmed by Rykwert in an interview about van Eyck, in which he states that both of them alwajs agreed . . . that [architecture] has to do with whatjou believe about life and death , the way you see society cohere , the waj institutions fix certain social notions, the way these notions are represented ... to the outside world . This approach finally aims at the reconstitution of the architectural object . . . a connecting with, incorporating, assuming certain archetypical forms.™ 27.

Today, except in Jungian circles and mystic websites, nobody gives credit to the theory that considers archetypes as belonging to each human being's hereditary constitution, biologically embedded in the mind and soul, and revealed under the guise of multiple representations that vary widely from epoch to epoch and place to place. "The Idea of a Town" also mentions DumeziPs renown- ed theory of the division of the three functions (sovereignty and religion, warfare, production) that one could supposedly discover in the language, the social hierarchy, and the mythology of every Indo-European population.*1 Dumézil was a close friend of one of the founders of religious studies in academia, the polygraph Mircea Eliade.32 Rykwert would use Eliade's volume to propel his underlying thesis that reli- gious experience is a universal and autonomous phenome- non: "I may not have made sufficiently clear that I am touching on one of the great commonplaces of religious experience."** Further on, writing about the foundational rite of ploughing as a hierogamy, a sacred marriage between earth and sky, he insists: "The earth is the great mother whose fertility is increased by tilling and ploughing," a sen- tence backed by a reference to Eliade, with a further insis- tence on the universality of religious phenomenology: "This is true for many cultures, maybe for most."*4 Nowadays, such a belief in the universality of religions would be put into question. At this point, it is indispensable to recall that a common feature unifies all the aforementioned authors, which is a probable connection to conservative thinking. As is well known, Jung accepted the copresidency of the German psy- choanalytical society from 1933 to 1939, and was hiding his religion of an Aryan-only cult of redemption and rebirth.*5 Hautecœur was a high functionary in the Vichy regime.*6 Today, the extreme-right involvement of Mircea Eliade is well documented.*7 Finally, while the prewar monarchist engagement of Dumézil has been revealed, he has been accused of past sympathies for Nazi ideas.*8 Probably, like many, Rykwert came to know of all those unsavory facts only in a later period, and presumably he seemed to have no reason to become tainted with extreme-right politics. However, what hovers in Rykwert' s text, like incense's per- sistent odor in a sacristy, is a general "mystical" tone, together with an ahistorical belief in the universality of 31.

However, in the "analogical" chapters of his book, Rykwert persists in focusing on the permanence of the "cosmological structure" throughout the history of humanity. He submits the hypoth- esis of "irreducible elements" as a fundamental pattern of human essence, appearing to be so recurrent in the most var- ied circumstances that they had to reside in the biological structure of mankind. Quite abruptly, mythography, ethnol- ogy, psychology - and now biology - are brought in, as if to uphold and give certainty to the "anthropological" project. As a matter of fact, sciences are introduced to give force to a project which, superficially, is not far from what "struc- turalism" had attempted to accomplish during the 1950s and '60s. However, it must be said that the whole book is organ- ized in a double, or even triple, nature: first, "classical" or Greco-Roman archaeology; second, readings into religious symbolism, the pervasive "sacred sciences" and - extremely reactionary - exoteric knowledge; and, finally, a whole set of sources that, broadly speaking, belongs to the realm of "structuralism." But was the book a "structuralist" project? In mixing disparate sources and approaches, Rykwert* s endeavor risks losing its coherence along the way. Nevertheless, in the last section, one is reassured to find what a scholar of the 1960s and '70s would be expected to have read: pioneers in linguistics such as Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson; Emile Benveniste's volumes on linguistics and on Indo-European institutions; Jean- Pierre Vernanti "structural" research on Greek mythology; André Leroi-Gourhan's volumes on the palaeography of technology, and so forth.44 In addition to extensive consider- ai 19.

However, by the time The Idea of a Town was pub- lished, structuralism was something of the past. Which brings us to a vexing question of terminology, since van Eyck's school in the Netherlands is often charac- terized as "structuralism in architecture," referring to the work of N.John Habraken, Herman Hertzberger, or Piet Blom, who formed the so-called "configurative" movement. Arnulf Lüchinger, their spokesman, opens his 1981 book Structuralism in Architecture and Urban Planning with a chap- ter on "structural" thinking that begins with a reference to the work of Lévi-Strauss.45 However, the work of the anthropologist is not actually taken up seriously, and struc- turalism becomes just an easy label, a new brand promoted by these architects. In a comical way, the formula of struc- turalism is opposed to existentialism, opposite poles that are translated into the notions of constraint (structure) vs. free- dom (existence). To buttress this theoretical gem, the 1959 Otterlo lectures of Aldo van Eyck are cited, including the dual/twin phenomena idea, as a prop that could reconcile the epic struggle of "constraint" versus "freedom." Already around I960 and until 1968, structuralism had left the desks of academia and become a media phenomenon, part of the doxa and fodder for fashion and journalism. As Jean-Claude Milner has argued, the structuralist para- digm's achievement consisted in integrating objects that belong to culture into the realm of "hard," exact, and Galilean sciences, which were originally developed in con- nection to nature. Starting with linguistics, the "mother" of all human sciences, the paradigm will subsequently be app- 44 45.

It was the Greeks who opposed phusis (that which refers to nature) to thesis (which broadly denotes all that is human: mores, uses, customs, laws, society, history, and culture). To phusis belonged that which did not depend on the collective human will, but per- tained to the regular order of the world. To thesis belonged what was dependent on humanity's collective will.46 During the 20th century, there seemed to be some difficulty created by the great polarity opened up between the sciences of nature (hard sciences) and the sciences of man (humanities and social sciences). For structuralism, there was no dilem- ma. Everything that had belonged to the field of thesis (cul- ture) could be made the object of science, without reducing the field of thesis to that of phusis (nature), which would have introduced a naturalization of culture. Inspired by political economy, ethnology, and sociology, the scientific program of Lévi-Strauss was derived in particular from 19th-century comparative grammars of Indo-European languages, and the linguistics of Saussure, Trubetzkoy, Jakobson, and Benveniste. Those disciplines will enable him to assert a theory of difference (as opposed to sim- ilarity and analogy), demonstrated through the privileged subject matter of language, kinship and parenthood, mar- riage, myth, tales, eating manners, costumes, ornaments, tools and instruments, etc. For the "structural" anthro- pologist, segments of reality, which could be grasped by difference, belonged to realms of exchange and commun- ication.47 To consider the field of culture as the domain of exchange (and/or communication) will bear significant consequences at the level of later theory.48 The relatedness between nature and culture will be altered; a theory of knowledge will appear by applying empirical methods to data analysis and processing and ultimately, a new ontology of being and identity will spread, reshuffling the correlation between the One, the Same, and the Other.49 It should be clear that in no way has Aldo van Eyck's thought ever pertained to a "structuralist" methodology; and the reconciled dialectics of the Buberian Ich/Du does not belong to the binary operators that linguistics and structural anthropology were practicing. In his reference to the "other," van Eyck's genial intuition consisted in the intro- duction of exterior cultures, studied through various vol- umes of ethnography, including Marcel Griaule's report on the Dogon of Western Africa, published in Le Minotaure 45 46.

Instead, in a startling way, these readings, and various trips to West Africa in I960 and to the Pueblos of the Zuñi in 1961, offered for van Eyck a confirmation of Buberian dialogical theory.52 Van Eyck's dis- course and knowledge had nothing to do with "structural- ism" proper (in other words, Levi-Strauss's "structural anthropology"); van Eyck was using the studies that the French School of Ethnology had made about the Dogon before the advent of structuralism as a confirmation of Buberian metaphysics, which he in turn interpreted as an anthropological philosophy. This has been the source of much historical confusion about van Eyck and his relation- ship to anthropology. Together with Herman Haan, van Eyck and his wife traveled to the Dogon, with the knowledge of Montserrat Palau Marti's book, Les Dogonp but presumably without having read the seminal work of the French ethnographer Marcel Griaule, Dieu d'eau (194-8).54 The only copy in van Eyck's library is the 1966 edition. When they reached the land of the Dogon, they made the acquaintance of Paul Parin, his wife Goldy Parin-Matthey, and Fritz Morgen- thaler, three psychoanalysts from Zurich who were attempt- ing to psychoanalyze the Dogon in their search for the uni- versal existence of Freud's Oedipus complex. Fully aware of Griaule's studies, the three ethno-psychoanalysts acted as intermediaries for the van Eycks, basically explaining to 46 50.

In 196?, they published their book in German with the alluring title Whites Think Too Much , a volume translated into French in 1966 and read both by specialists and by many eager students of May 1968.55 In 196?, Aldo van Eyck prepared another issue of Forum , which was not published until 1967, for which Parin and Morgenthaler contributed two texts. Subsequently, both of the texts were translated and published under a new English heading, "A Miracle of Moderation," in the periodi- cal Via at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, and in Meaning in Architecture , edited by Charles Jencks and George Baird, in 1969.*6 The ideas and the sources of Griaule and his school are not mentioned in the last publication. Was omit- ting the mention of Griaule's school to an English audience a simple blunder by the editors, or was the absence of the foot- notes significant? One could probably call for a Lacanian interpretation of the three psychoanalysts' manque act, or parapraxis. Moreover, one could scrutinize why 40 printed pages were dedicated to questionable attempts of "probing the Dogon personality structure ."5? In the case of the Dogon civilization, ethnographers had seen that each village was perceived as "an organ of the landscape body," and that "each house in turn was thought as an organ of the village."58 Furthermore, it appeared that since man was himself an organ of the house there was a permanent interaction between body and organ. The cos- mology of the Dogon seemed to ratify and substantiate the particular analogy of landscape/body/organ, while reassert- ing an organic continuity between nature and culture. For architects like van Eyck, the Dogon* s world image came as an amazing ratification of their own (Western) system of analogies, which, for instance, had been enunciated during the CIAM 1959 in Otterlo with the reiteration of the classical credo: "A house must be like a small city if it's to be a real house; a city like a large house if it's to be a real city."59 Such an isomorphism at the base of his conception received an unexpected confirmation in ethnography.60 The previous analogy of the city/house was further expanded under another form and in a different guise - the analogy of the city with a tree. This was enunciated by Aldo van Eyck at Team 10's meeting at the Abbaye de Royaumont in September 1962: "Tree is leaf and leaf is tree - House is city and city is house."61 The first analogy of city/house is strengthened with a second metaphor (or an "image," to use the architect's terminology). There is a redoubling of the 47 55.

The identification of house and city can be traced back to Alberti and Palladio, although Francis Strauven believes that Aldo van Eyck wasn't aware of such precedents. However, it is proba- ble that he had overheard them, since such homologies were a standard part of an architect's education, especially in the 1940s.

Far from having a purely rhetorical effect, the metaphor here is not illustrative of an idea, but has the power to create a series of new meanings, becoming what Paul Ricoeur has defined as a "living metaphor."62 Here the metaphor doesn't proceed only by resemblance or similarity, but also works at a nonrhetorical level, which can be defined by the poetical, or poïesis, meaning production. In this case, the metaphor becomes an image that creates a model via its own dynamics. Poetic metaphors are probably what architects do best. For both van Eyck and Rykwert, ethnology comes to the res- cue of a Western metaphysical discourse. While this discourse was initially met with scepticism by the Team 10 members, it would eventually become one of the dominant theories throughout the 1960s and '70s.6* Such a new orthodoxy - soon to become part of the doxa - will spread through numerous publications, beginning with the final edition of the Team 10 Primer , edited by Alison Smithson, and its "Doorstep" section.64 Afterward, the anthology Meaning in Architecture ,6* which includes a text by Rykwert, will become a universal textbook in schools of architecture, leading toward an anthropologization of architectural discourses, and paving the way for postmodernist trends. * * * * As a double coda to this story, Genevieve Calarne -Griaule, the daughter of Griaule and herself a specialist of the Dogon, pub- lished a critical review in 1969 of Parin and Morgenthaler's book, reaffirming the principle that one should avoid identifying collective processes with individual ones.66 Moreover, she observed all sorts of irregularities: that the request for an analysis came from the investigators &gt; not from the subjects; that the "patients" were paid, thus assimilated to regular ethnographic informers; and that the interviews were conducted in French with translators, creating a linguistic gap incompatible with orthodox psychoanaly- sis. Ultimately - someone will appreciate the irony -in their Anti- Oedipus (1972), Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari will use both Parin' s and Griaule' s oeuvres to demonstrate the nonexistence of an African Oedipus 61 48 62.
