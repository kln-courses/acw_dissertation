<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology Metaphysics and Moral Philo sophy by Marvin Fox, (University of Chicago Press, 1990) 356 pp. Reviewed by Michael Wyschogrod After more than 300 pages of closely reasoned Maimonidean exegesis, Marvin Fox concludes his book with an "Epilogue: The Significance of Maimonides for Con temporary Judaism." The significance turns out to be a brief for an enlightened Orthodoxy. Enlightened Orthodoxy (not Fox's expression) is the mean between two extremes. On the one hand are the isolationists who reject the modern world com pletely and withdraw into a closed Jewish fortress from which all foreign influences are excluded. On the other are the modernists who jettison traditional religion for the spirit of the times. The third way, that of Maimonides and of enlightened Ortho doxy, is to keep the old and the new in balance. Maimonides is prepared to accept the truth from whatever source it comes. Non-Jewish philosophers and scientists need to be studied with deep attention and when they teach truths that can be rationally demonstrated, such teachings must influence our interpretation of Torah because the Torah cannot conflict with demonstrated rational truths. Needless to say, only those who control classical Jewish learning are in a position to interpret the Torah in the light of established philosophic and scientific truths. But it is the message of Maimonides that a knowledge of the intellectual achievements of humanity is an essential element in the proper understanding of Torah. Another important lesson that Maimonides can teach contemporary Judaism, according to Fox, is the importance of formulating a body of doctrine. There are those who stress the fulfilling of the commandments instead of theoretical specula tion. Fox believes that Judaism without a body of doctrine on which it rests is an anomaly. Rational beings must have a reason for doing what they do and this requires developing a philosophic framework that makes sense of the Torah system. Otherwise, we are dealing with a form of halakhic behaviorism which Fox rejects. Finally, Fox argues, we can learn from Maimonides the legitimacy of seeking the reasons for the commandments. Cod does not command arbitrarily or capri ciously. It therefore behooves us to search out the reasons for the commandments. Fox is aware of the danger of this approach. Once we are convinced that we have discovered the reason for a commandment, it is easy to take the next step and con clude that, in view of changed circumstances, the commandment is no longer rele vant either because its goal can now be achieved better in some other way or because it is no longer necessary to try to achieve that particular goal. For this rea son, Fox insists that however hard Maimonides worked to understand the reasons for the commandments, never did he feel free to suspend a commandment on the grounds mentioned. The ultimate authority of the commandments is that they emanate from God and are therefore binding whether or not we understand their purposes and whether or not circumstances have changed. Maimonides' orthodoxy is therefore secure. 69 TRADITION 28:2 / ©1994 Rabbinical Council of America</page><page sequence="2">TRADITION The Epilogue is important for two reasons. Interpreters do their work from a perspective and in the Epilogue, more than anywhere else in the book, Fox reveals his perspective. Without the Epilogue, the book could be read strictly as a piece of intellectual history whose aim is to understand the mind of Maimonides but not to judge it. With the Epilogue, it becomes perfectly clear that Fox is not a historian but a philosopher. While he is trying to understand Maimonides, he is also interested in the issues Maimonides raises and has opinions about them. He stands for an enlight ened Orthodoxy that is loyal to the biblical-rabbinic tradition but that is also deeply interested in the intellectual currents of the day. Like Maimonides, he strives for a philosophically viable Judaism and he reveres Maimonides because he sees him as the master who made the enterprise Jewishly respectable. But the Epilogue is important for another reason as well. It seems that Maimonides' significance for contemporary Judaism is more formal than substantive. Maimonides can teach us not to ignore the philosophic climate of the day. He can teach us to accept the truth from whatever source, Jewish or non-Jewish, it derives and that it is legitimate to search for the reasons behind the commandments. But when it comes to the specific answers Maimonides gave to these questions, Fox seems less sure that Maimonides can teach us very much. Many of the reasons Maimonides gave for various commandments are not persuasive for us today (p.339). And when it comes to Maimonides' substantive philosophical convictions with which most of the book deals, none of them finds its way into the Epilogue. It seems that the opinion that we cannot attach positive attributes to God is not an opinion very useful today. Nor is Maimonides' account of divine causality. Nor are many other Maimonidean positions Fox deals with in the book. If they were, they would have found their way into the Epilogue. But the Epilogue is purely formal, almost entirely non-substantive. It endorses Maimonides' interest in philosophy and science but not the particular philosophic and scientific ideas so dear to Maimonides. Maimonides' problem was, of course, that he had two loyalties: one to the bib lical-rabbinic tradition and the other to Aristotelian philosophy. On Aristotelian grounds (pp. 306-307) he was convinced that Cod had no body, that he did not change and that all terms applied to God (e.g., knowledge, power, will, life, etc.) mean something completely different when applied to God and when used in their normal senses as applied to beings other than God. From this it follows that when such terms are applied to God, they mean nothing we can understand and for this reason we can only say what God is not, never what he is. But the bible and the rabbis did not hesitate to apply all kinds of positive attrib utes to Cod. In petitionary prayer, we hope to influence God to change his decree from punishment to forgiveness. From the philosophical point of view, this is non sense because it presumes that God can be caused to change by means of external influences. Fox concludes (p. 311 ) that for Maimonides "the conventional picture of God who hears the cry of the oppressed and hastens to their succor is not to be taken literally. It is a doctrine that the Torah, if read literally, teaches, together with the practice of petitionary prayer that it implies, in order to reinforce a belief that is essential for the welfare of the individual and society." But the sophisticated know better. "Although this manner of speaking about God's actions [as being subject to influence through prayer—M.W.] is also adopted by the Sages, Maimonides holds that they never intended it to be understood literally by sophisticated men, although they did recognize that one must speak this way for the masses." (p. 313). Just as God permitted sacrifices as a concession to the masses who could not 70</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews be weaned from the practice without disastrous onsequences, so God permits peti tionary prayer to the masses. But true philosophers know that it is not prayer but contemplation of God that is worthy of rational men (p.316). Presumably, when philosophers engage in sacrifices and petitionary prayer, they do so in order not to scandalize the masses. But, in truth, they know better. For long stretches, Fox sounds as if he has made peace with Leo Strauss's view that the Guide contains a secret teaching which must be kept from the masses but which must be communicated to those worthy of the higher truth. Given the intel lectual straits in which Maimonides places himself, this reading makes some sense. It amounts to saying that Maimonides is really a non-believer in the traditional teach ings of Judaism who assumes the discipline of Torah practice for the benefit of the vast majority of Jews who are not capable of grasping pure philosophical truth. While Fox comes close to adopting Strauss' view, in the final analysis he cannot do so. Maimonides' biblical-rabbinic loyalties are too deep to be interpreted as a facade hiding an Aristotelian anti-biblicism. "For those who are predisposed to remove Maimonides from the traditional religious community," concedes Fox (pp. 21-22), "it is not difficult to read him in such a way that he turns out to be a crypto-heretic. Considering all that we know of the man and his life, his piety, and his meticulous commitment to the Law, this hard ly seems to be a tenable position." So if Maimonides is not a crypto-heretic, if his biblical-rabbinic Judaism with all its anthropomorphism, sacrifice and petitionary prayer is not a concession to the masses, then what are we to make of the man? Could it be that he is a crypto-philosopher whose philosophic vocabulary hides a deeply anti-Aristotelian enterprise, an orthodox believer who uses Aristotelian terms to undermine Aristotelian philosophy so as to make Judaism palatable to those who respect Aristotle, hoping all the time that they will not recognize his deep anti Aristotelianism? At times, Fox flirts with this possibility. In a discussion of "The Doctrine of the Mean in Aristotle and Maimonides," Fox concludes (p. 119): "With all the similarities between Aristotle's and Maimonides' doctrine of the mean, and with the especially striking similarity between the medical analogies of both thinkers, there is at the core a fundamental difference. On these matters, Maimonides is controlled finally by the Jewish tradition, rather than by the principles of Greek philosophy." The mean for Aristotle is far more flexible, having about it an inescapable element of changing convention, while the Torah has an inescapable element of fixity and per manence. Maimonides uses Aristotle's mean in his ethics but he Judaizes it. Nevertheless, Fox is too good a philosopher to pretend that the Aristotelianism of Maimonides is but an insignificant veneer over his Judaism. "His [Maimonides'J guiding rule, " writes Fox (p. 40), "is that what reason finds incorrect and unaccept able cannot be the meaning of Scripture, no matter what it appears to say." Should anyone be inclined to doubt Fox's assertion, he need only remind himself of Maimonides' comment in the Guide (11:25) that if reason could prove the eternity of the world, he would have no greater difficulty reconciling that view with the verses in Scripture that seem to teach creation in time than he had in reconciling the incor poreality of God with the verses that seem to attribute corporeal characteristics to God. Fox thinks (p.266) that this is so because "the language of Scripture is inher ently ambiguous on this point [creation in time—M.W.]." It is not the language of Scripture that is ambiguous on the doctrine of creation in time. It is Maimonides who is convinced, as Fox says, "that what reason finds incorrect and unacceptable 71</page><page sequence="4">TRADITION cannot be the meaning of Scripture, no matter what it appears to say [my emphasis— M.W.]." Scripture and rabbinic texts are thus no obstacle to any doctrine, as long as Maimonides is convinced that the doctrine is rationally sound. Scripture and rab binic texts are subject to interpretation, guided by reason. Where reason yields uncertain results, Scripture needs to be listened to on its own terms. But when rea son speaks clearly, Scripture must yield. It is remarkable that nowhere does Fox entertain the possibility that what Maimonides considers rationally demonstrated is itself influenced by his biblical loy alties. Compare the question of the corporeality of God with the eternity of the world. Maimonides considers it rationally provable that God is not corporeal but not that the world is eternal. From the purely philosophic point of view, the corpore ality of God seems to me less irrational than the doctrine of coming into being out of nothing. Coming into being out of nothing violates the fundamental Parmenidian horror at non-being, a horror that, in modified form, permeates the metaphysics of both Plato and Aristotle. Yet Maimonides is willing to declare the non-corporeality of God demonstrated but not the eternity of substance. It seems to me that Maimonides' Judaism is here influencing his metaphysical judgment. He probably sensed that it was Jewishly more licit to fight for the non-corporeality of God than for the eternity of the world. At the same time, it was not easy for him to declare the well established metaphysical doctrine of the eternity of substance to be unproven. So, while declaring the eternity of the world unproven, he could not resist adding that, were this not the case, he could reconcile eternal substance with Scripture. Fortunately, he did not have to although he could have done so. But had he done it, it seems to me, had he declared substance eternal and proceeded to square the cre ation account in Genesis with the doctrine of eternal substance, he would have had a much bigger fight on his hand than on the corporeality of God issue. Rabad, who remarks that better men than Maimonides have refused to deny the corporeality of God, did not himself affirm the corporeality of God. One can only speculate how he would have reacted had Maimonides affirmed that substance is eternal and uncreat ed and the bible ¿an be read to harmonize with this view. Luckily, Maimonides did not have to take this path because he convinced himself that the eternity of the world has not been demonstrated. I suggest that he did not consider this view ratio nally demonstrated because his Judaism would not allow it. Reason is not as sover eign as Fox seems to think. It functions within a cultural context. This seems to be one of the truths that at least one school of contemporary philosophy has "demon strated," to use the Aristotelian-Maimonidean expression somewhat ironically. Fox is fully aware that Maimonides is trying to live in two worlds, the philosoph ical and the biblical. He is also aware that these two worlds are in conflict about fun damental issues. "His approach/' writes Fox (p. 22), . . is to eschew the way of 'either/or' and to adopt instead the way of 'both/and'. Maimonides regularly takes seemingly opposed positions on certain issues, not because he is intellectually mud dled or dishonest, or has a program for the elite that differs from his program for the untutored masses." Again and again, Fox speaks of "balanced dialectical tension" (p. 23, 43, 46, 79, 249, 258, 260, 260 n.11, 297, 324), a term that apparently refers to holding opposed views that cannot be reconciled. It is Fox's way of saving Maimonides from the charge that he was a heretic who clothed his unorthodox views in an outer orthodox shell meant to be ignored by the initiated. If we read Maimonides as teaching a secret doctrine for the elite, then there are no unresolved tensions. There is only one truth: that of Aristotle and his unmoved mover who is 72</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews not merciful, and eternal matter that was never created (to name but two un-Jewish teachings in the Aristotelian system) and the doctrine propagated to the masses that is biblical and rabbinic but not true. I agree with Fox that the heretical Maimonides is a wrong reading. Maimonides would have been a heretic if he had thought through his doctrines to their logical conclusion, if he had been perfectly consistent. I do not think he held doctrines which he understood to be in conflict with each other. Rather, I think he convinced himself that he had reconciled Judaism and Aristotle. Fox sees that he has not and that is why he invokes the "balanced dialectical tension" interpretation. We today know that the Greek world and and the biblical world were not the same, that they had different perspectives on many issues and that it is not necessary to homoge nize them. But for Maimonides, as for medievals in general, history was far less important than it is for us. They saw the greats of all ages—Abraham, Moses, Plato, Aristotle and the others—engaged in a dialogue across the centuries which would ultimately yield the one final truth. The task of the philosopher is to formulate the final truth that is above all historical localization. That is what Maimonides was try ing to do. The question is: did Maimonides succeed? I do not think he did but I cannot tell whether Fox thinks he did. Does Fox believe that by invoking the formula of "dialectical tensions" Maimonides can get away with holding contradictory posi tions without, in the final analysis, casting his lot with one or the other of the contra dictions? Fox seems to think that one can be a true philosopher whose highest loyal ty is reason and a true believer whose highest loyalty is Scripture at one and the same time. That this is not so can be seen from the fact that when Scripture and rea son conflict, Scripture is reinterpreted. One of Maimonides' favorite rabbinic dicta is the claim that the the Torah speaks in the language of men. For him, this means that many things that the Torah says are merely commonly used expressions not to be taken literally, which gives the philosopher the opportunity to dismiss philosophical ly unacceptable expressions (e.g., those attributing corporeality to Cod) as not in need of being taken seriously. If the rabbinic dictum that the Torah speaks in the language of men is one of Maimonides' favorites, one of his least favorite rabbinic dicta is the teaching that a verse never loses its peshat meaning (BT Shabb. 63a, Yevam. 11b and 24a). He almost never quotes it and understandably so. For those, like Rashi, for whom the peshat was fundamental, the problem of anthropomorphism never assumed the magnitude it did for Maimonides. The basic problem with this book is that it is not a purely historical study in the style of Isadore Twersky and others whose aim is to deal with an author in the intel lectual setting of his time. Fox is partly a historian but, as his Epilogue proves, he is writing as a thinking Jew of the present who is deeply concerned with Judaism and contemporary philosophic issues. In this context, he fails to make Maimonides rele vant to the present. Philosophy today does not yield "demonstrated truths." The very notion of rationality is undergoing deep re-examination in light of the events of this century. The impact of Midrash on the literary climate of our time illustrates the power of Judaism to speak to the culture of our time, to shape our very understand ing of the nature of modes of discourse. None of this is reflected in Fox's work. His favorite post-Maimonidean philosophers seem to be Hume and Kant. Hegel is miss ing as are Kierkegaard, Gadamer and Levinas, to mention but a few of the names whose influence would have produced a richer reading of Maimonides. 73</page><page sequence="6">TRADITION Contemporary French and German philosophy is particularly aware of the com plexity of the interpretive enterprise itself. Fox seems to think that the criterion of a correct interpretation of Maimonides is Maimonides' intention and almost nothing else. The author is the sovereign owner of his work and the task of the interpreter is to try to fathom, as best as he can, what the author meant when he wrote. But once a work is written, it embarks on a life of its own. The author is not a privileged inter preter because an author may be quite unaware of significant issues lurking in the margins of his work. The midrashic method is so interesting because it frees itself from searching for "the" meaning of the text because it understands that interpretation is an interplay between text and interpreter with the interpreter sometimes playing a more important role than the author. The very notion that a text is created by a sover eign author is itself questionable. Often, the author is the instrument through whom complex linguistic, structural and symbolic systems express themselves. The simple search for the "intention" of the author is an unreflective stage of interpretation. Fox is to be commended for his defense of an enlightened Orthodox Judaism that does not cut itself off, as Maimonides did not, from the best in human thought. "We must be prepared," writes Fox (pp. 326-327), "to learn the truth from whatever source it may come even if it is external to our own community of faith. The great est minds and the deepest thinkers of all ages and places must always be taken seri ously." I would only add that this applies also to thinkers outside of the empirical analytic philosophical tradition.</page></plain_text>
