<plain_text><page sequence="1">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live": Guitar Drag s Archaeology of Indeterminacy and Violence Carlos Kase In 2000, sonic and visual artist Christian Marclay produced a video installation entitled Guitar Drag. The video features a single activity as its primary action: a pickup truck dragging a loudly amplified electric guitar across a rural landscape. Upon first glance, what we find here is an inscrutable work that in its relatively unadorned visual style seems little more than the straightforward documenta- tion of a sonic art event. Like much rock and roll, the work is sim- ple, loud, unpretentious, and affecting. However, in its underlying interaction with a variety of cultural registers, Guitar Dragis a multi- valent artistic meditation on a range of seemingly unrelated aes- thetic, historical, ethical, and ontological problems. This essay presents an archaeology of Guitar Drag, in the form of an inquiry into its associations, its referents, and its cultural prece- dents. Ultimately, it connects the destructive and indeterminate artistic strategies of this video to a constellation of other works, per- formances, and historical events that share structural resemblances and, in some cases, related philosophical purposes. Included in this web of reference is a range of texts and actions that exhibit tenden- cies toward the use of caustic violence (often directed toward extremely dissimilar ends) - in anarchic performance art, rock-and- roll music, and racist hate crimes - and engage in an interplay Discourse, 30.3, Fall 2008, pp. 419-442.

By pulling a screeching, wailing electric guitar behind a pickup truck, Marclay created a sonic work using the timbres of rock and roll, but compositional methods derived from the innovations in indeterminacy that were initiated by avant-garde classical composer John Cage. Structurally, Guitar Drag, like many of Cage's works, is a conceptual project that reframes considerations of historical index- icality and authorship within an unusual art event in which control, chance, and intention are forced to interact in atypical ways within the predetermined limits of a sort of aesthetic field experiment. In this sense, the work is an investigation into the possible aesthetic and conceptual resonances between a planned but inexplicable act of brute violence on an inanimate object; the uncontrollable, abstract, unpitched sound that it produces; and a multivalent web of artistic and cultural associations that underpin it. In its performance strategies, its sensory impact, its artistic referents, and its political subtext, Guitar Drag foregrounds a variety of vigorous historical encounters between violence and chance in popular culture, fine art, and American history throughout the later half of the twentieth century.

He starts the truck's engine and drags the amplified guitar behind the vehi- cle as it speeds across grass, dirt and, most noisily, asphalt. The soundtrack features two aural registers: the abrasive clamor that screeches from the amplifier as the guitar isjerked and bounced vio- lently across the terrain and the atmospheric growl that is produced by the motion of the pickup truck and the guitar's wooden body as it jerks and bounces across the ground. In its exhibition, the video is installed on a playback loop in a dark gallery space, and the sound is aggressively loud. When one walks toward the room in which the video plays, the sound can be heard from a distance; the audio component of the installation envelops the spaces that adjoin its projection. The artist described the exhibition conditions as an imperative: "It has to be a projection, it has to be loud. ... It has to be a physical experience; you need to feel it through your body. It's not a pleasant experience, though some people are exhilarated by the sound, its rock quality."1 Encountering Guitar Dragin a museum or gallery space is something like walking into a rock-and-roll arena concert. However, what one experiences inside the room in which the video is projected is sig- nificantly more enigmatic than most guitar-heavy rock spectacles. Guitar Drag was shot in San Antonio, Texas, in 1999, within about a year of the violent murder, in the same state, of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was viciously dragged to death behind a pickup truck by three white men associated with Aryan supremacist hate groups. Guitar Drag contains explicit visual markers - a weathered pickup truck, a Texas license plate, a piece of rope, shaded country roads - that frame it within a singular historical and rhetorical con- text related directly to the gruesome killing of James Byrd Jr. As is clear from these visual details, Guitar Drag addresses contemporary events, but by using a central symbol that is not directly related to this tragedy. The result is a stark and disturbingly open-ended metaphorical commentary on racial violence in America in which the artist has transferred an act of extreme racial violence against a human being onto an inanimate object that triggers a knotty tangle of sensorial and cultural associations. On one rhetorical level, Guitar Drag is an explicitly political work of humanist protest art. It is, however, willfully riddled with</page><page sequence="4">422 Carlos Kase ambivalences - regarding the relationship between popular culture and fine art, the pleasures as well as the clichés of rock-and-roll expe- rience, the authenticity of performance and its mediation, and social protest in art. In this regard, the tone of the piece is inten- tionally enigmatic: it is charged with meaning, but its rhetorical intentions are unclear (and eerily distanced from their tragic his- torical referent by way of a substitution in visual iconography). Is it making fun of guitar-slinging rock heroes or is it celebrating them?2 During an interview in 2001, Marclay directly responded to the chaotic rhetorical interaction of these different registers of allusion and signification. He explained how the work referenced Fluxus artist Nam June Paik, noisy art rock of the 1980s and, of course, the murder of James Byrd Jr. He then explained that this conflict between different layers of signification was intentional: All these references are there, and I think it really depends on the viewer's interest, knowledge, and state of mind. People will have different readings of this video, and I want all these to be legitimate. Ultimately, I made the video because of what happened to James Byrd, but all these other refer- ences allowed me to think of the guitar as this very anthropomorphic instrument that was already associated with violence, and with rebellion, and crazy youth. I think it's fine when people walk out of there disgusted. I think it's also fine when they walk out of there exhilarated.3 As Marclay suggests, it is conceptually and aesthetically reasonable to respond to the work in terms of its particular sensory conditions, its musical and sonic force, and the way in which it provocatively reconfigures the most iconic of rock-and-roll timbres - a piercing, strident, distorted, and amplified electric guitar - in the service of a socially motivated commentary on racially motivated violence. Yet, it is also a reflection on a variety of histories, a kind of summation of a complex and unwieldy group of destructive and violent artistic practices that extend across varied cultural terrain. In this sense, it embodies a paradox of tighdy woven referents and indefinite rhetor- ical framing, while it encourages a consideration of the very limits of the pleasurable, in both ethical and aesthetic terms. Risk, Performance, and Danger Guitar Drag draws upon the unruly histories of destructive and con- frontational aesthetics in performance art and punk rock. In these cultural movements, there was a shared emphasis on real-time, real- world encounters between bodies and objects framed by tangible</page><page sequence="5">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live " 423 social and psychic pressures and the threat of violence. These ten- sions were not resolved in the works, but were rather shown to be irreducible. This impasse produced performance-based projects that emphasized an acting-out of contingent, bodily presence at the expense of linguistic meaning and formal plasticity. These social and aesthetic tensions catalyzed art-making strategies that blended the unpredictable force of chance with the threat of violence as a means of activating physical, social, and aesthetic risk across a range of media throughout a diverse cultural field. Marclay was one of a number of artists of his generation to make a connection between the aforementioned cultural histories. He said, "These two influences, punk and performance art, were very closely linked for me, with artists like Vito Acconci and their work on the body on one side, then groups like the Sex Pistols and their very aggressive and destructive relation to the body, on the other."4 Many artists of the 1970s produced works of bodily distress. In Vito Acconci's Trademarks (1970), he repeatedly bit deeply into his own skin while naked, leaving impressions of his teeth all over his body; he then used ink to transfer the visual traces of those bites to other surfaces. In his performance Shoot ( 1971 ) , Chris Burden staged a sit- uation in which his collaborator shot him in the arm with a pistol from across the room. In 1974, Joseph Beuys locked himself in an art gallery with a coyote for three days and provocatively titled the work I Like America and America Likes Me. These planned encounters with sometimes unpredictable and indeterminate forces of potential vio- lence called attention to lived bodily experience by testing its phys- ical, carnal limits. These strategies were also common to punk rock performance. In both contexts, this hostility was often visited on the body of the artist. In 1973, in the same year in which Chris Burden perilously crawled across a sidewalk of broken glass in his performance Through the Night Softly , singer Iggy Pop publicly spilled his blood over the stage of Max's Kansas City (in New York City) following an encounter, which was perhaps accidental, with smashed glassware. Performed violence was also a factor in the interaction of performer and audience. For example, in 1978, during a tour of the American South, Sid Vicious, bassist of the Sex Pistols, intentionally imparted a bloody blow upon the head of an audience member with his instru- ment. (This famous event took place in San Antonio, Texas, the same town in which Marclay shot Guitar Drag.) A number of punk performers and performance artists achieved public notoriety by incorporating their bodies in other gestures that tested the limits of conventional taste and often led to citations for public nudity and</page><page sequence="6">424 Carlos Kase sexually suggestive performance.5 Punk rock, like performance art and the happenings of an earlier generation, stressed the fluidity between art and life as it drew attention away from the contained world of the pop song by celebrating the liveness and social insta- bility of cramped public spaces that activated punk subcultures.6 Like many of his contemporaries who had gone to art school, Marclay 's experience of the cultural field of late 1970s New York City bolstered his distrust of the institutional divisions between popular music and fine art that he had inherited. On this topic, he said, For me what was going on in the New York clubs was much more interest- ing than what was happening in the galleries or museums. There was music - punk rock, no wave, DNA - and then once in a while there were artists doing things that were not necessarily music, but more perform- ances. I'd see Sid Vicious do something one night at Max's Kansas City, and then Dan Graham the next night at the Mudd Club, or things by Laurie Anderson. There was a very interesting mix between club culture with some art events and punk rock.7 In keeping with Marclay's observations, performance historian Roselee Goldberg acknowledges this interaction between strategies of performance art and punk rock in her foundational history of the medium. She argues that performance art has always drawn on "aspects of spectacle and entertainment," but that this synergy between popular forms and fine-art practice accelerated in the late 1970s.8 She explains that many younger artists, who followed Acconci and Burden historically, were employing a "new style of per- formance, while reflecting the punk aesthetic, with its anarchic and overtly sadistic and erotic attitudes."9 The hostility of these perfor- mance trends was also a symbolic violence directed against the insti- tutionalized boundaries that divided these seemingly disparate cultural registers. "This Guitar Has Seconds to Live": Rock 8c Roll and Fluxus With the electric guitar as its central symbolic icon, Marclay's Guitar Drag openly references rock-and-roll history and its cultural legacy of performed violence and instrument destruction. Within popular music, the history of guitar smashing precedes punk rock by at least a decade. The 1960s featured a number of famous episodes of instrument destruction, initiating a history that is a central consid- eration of Marclay's video installation. One of the most iconic episodes occurred during the American debut of the Jimi Hendrix</page><page sequence="7">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live " 425 Experience on 18 June 1967 at the Monterey Pop Festival, in which the guitarist incinerated his instrument on stage before smashing it to bits.10 In his performance, Hendrix dramatically anthropomor- phized the instrument as he simulated a variety of sexual acts with it, kissing it "goodbye" on its neck before spraying it suggestively with lighter fluid, burning it, smashing it, and throwing its remains into the crowd. Hendrix's guitar-obliterating gesture has served as a sym- bolic currency for the notion of freedom that has so often domi- nated the rhetoric of popular music of the 1960s. At the same time, it is also a rather straightforward act of displaced sexual violence. Like Hendrix, The Who's Pete Townshend smashed a Fender Stratocaster at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. In fact, Townshend smashed countless guitars over a number of years, making it a pre- dictable detail of his performance routine. For the release of The Who's The Kids Are Alright, their career retrospective 1979 film and accompanying two-album set, their recording label famously pro- duced an advertisement featuring a concert photograph of the gui- tarist in one of his instrument-smashing frenzies, accompanied by the phrase "This Guitar Has Seconds to Live." This marketing gesture has uncanny resonances with both the anthropomorphic underpinnings of Marclay's video piece and Hendrix's treatment of the instrument. The wanton waste that these guitar-smashing acts entailed elicited a variety of critical responses, being variously construed as macho pos- turing and bourgeoisie decadence, on the one hand, or artistic demonstration and social protest, on the other. This ambivalence between spectacle and statement underpins Guitar Drag, as well. Like many English rock-and-roll musicians of his generation, Pete Townshend attended art school. There he studied a variety of avant-garde practices that informed his thinking about rock and roll in general, showing evidence of an acculturation process that was changing the relationship between popular music and the fine arts. Interestingly, music scholars Simon Frith and Howard Home iden- tify a number of factors in Townshend's performance sensibility that demonstrated a keen awareness of developments outside of popular culture, particularly in experimental music and performance art, including the deliberate application of chance, the risk of the acci- dent, and the use of noise. The conscious incorporation of such fac- tors in rock and roll was evidence of a changing cultural landscape. And actually, with the rise of pop art, these exchanges between pop- ular music and the fine arts would become only more accelerated in the coming years. Townshend was a central figure in this shifting relationship between the popular arts and the fine arts. Frith and Home argue that Townshend</page><page sequence="8">426 Carlos Kase Figure 2. Promotional materials for The Who's The Kids Are Alright LP, featuring Pete Townshend in performance at Madison Square Garden, New York City, on 11 June 1974.</page><page sequence="9">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live " 42 7 saw his own musical activities in terms of performance art, which meant seeing the Who's stage act itself as the moment of artistic creation and exploring the constraints of this - the dynamic relationship between star and audience, the effects of chance and accident , the shifting borders between music and noise.11 In fact, Townshend claimed on a number of occasions that it was Gustav Metzger, the performance artist and political activist respon- sible for the Destruction in Arts Symposium of 1966 in London, who gave him the idea to smash his instrument. In December of 1962, Metzger gave a presentation at the Ealing School of Art (in Lon- don), where The Who's guitar player was then a student. According to some accounts, Metzger destroyed a bass guitar during this pres- entation. Although Metzger may have inspired Townshend, there is a fundamental difference in meaning between Townshend's destructive gestures, however self-conscious they may have been, and those of more politically minded artists, which suggests that sim- ilar performance actions can have radically different meanings, depending on their contexts and framing structures.12 Metzger was the leader of a midcentury movement in destruc- tive art, an approach to art making by subtraction that emphasized the destruction of objects in performance. (He was also an associate of the Fluxus group.) In some of his earliest public performances, Metzger, often wearing a military gas mask, sprayed highly corrosive acid onto giant pieces of cloth that were framed as canvases for painting. He also made self-destructing machines that, like his acid paintings, were subject to a unique blend of indeterminacy and vio- lence. For Metzger, a holocaust survivor and political activist, this mix of violent artistic strategies was far from playful. His public per- formances were often supported by dramatic publicly read mani- festos that presented his explicitly metaphorical work as a direct commentary on the dangers of institutionalized violence and the real physical and psychological traumas of war. In his "Manifesto Auto-Destructive Art" of 1960, he wrote that this art "re-enacts the obsession with destruction, the pummeling to which individuals and masses are subjected" and that it "mirrors the compulsive perfec- tionism of arms manufacture - polishing to destruction point.'43 Art historian Kristine Stiles explains the meaning of Metzger's "disinte- grative processes"14 when she writes, " [H] e analyzed the phenomena of the destruction of materials through change, chance, and inde- terminacy as the basis of kinesis and destruction in political, psy- chological, and social material."15 As the work of Townshend and Metzger demonstrates, these artistic strategies of chance, kinesis,</page><page sequence="10">428 Carlos Kase and destruction were simultaneously active in both rock and roll and performance art. The destruction of commodities and artworks, throughout a variety of art practices in the 1960s, was intended to function as a symbolic act, a protest, a ritual exorcism, or even a sublimation of psychological tensions, depending on the practitioner's sensibility. In some cases, as in the work of Metzger, the object of disdain was military industrial power, and for others, as in much Fluxus work, it was commodity fetishism that became the target of rhetorical and performative violence. In rock and roll of this era, the sym- bolic valence of destructive gestures was less explicitly political despite Townshenďs efforts to use Metzger's practice as a kind of conceptual rationalization for what might have been, at least ini- tially, a simple act of adolescent frustration. Since the 1960s, the history of popular music has contained a tangible tension between the pleasure of the music and the politics that occasionally have been associated with it.16 As Marclay himself points out, this con- flict is central to Guitar Drag, as well: in his words, it is a video that addresses "the tension between fun and violence."17 This funda- mental philosophical tension within late modern Western culture enabled rock and roll to showcase both ecstatic exuberance and nihilistic frustration. Paik, Cage, and the Trace of Performance The Fluxus group is a loosely affiliated international aggregate of musicians, poets, video artists, filmmakers, and performance artists who eschewed traditional divisions between disciplines, media, and cultural registers. In addition to this shared disregard for conven- tional divisions between art forms, the Fluxus artists of the 1960s produced works that undermined the sanctity of the collectable art object as a cultural commodity that could be bought and sold in the gallery market. To blend these two philosophical projects effec- tively, the Fluxus group (like many other avant-garde artists of the era) produced works that were performance based, musical, con- ceptual, and ludic. Such projects included ephemeral mail art, event scores, sound poetry, live aleatory performances, and hap- penings, all activities that admitted great leeway for the interaction of accidental and chance factors, from the most peaceful to the most destructive. In the late 1970s, Christian Marclay witnessed a memorable per- formance by Fluxus artist Nam June Paik at the rather unlikely venue</page><page sequence="11">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live" 429 of CBGB's, one of punk rock's most historic venues in New York City. Opening for the No Wave band DNA, Paik performed his piece One for Violin Solo (1962). In it, through an act of Zen-inspired restraint, he slowly brought an amplified violin from behind his head, moving it extremely slowly toward the ground, until he finally smashed it in a loud thud at the piece's conclusion, fifteen minutes later.18 In a very explicit way, Marclay 's Guitar Drag refer enees Paik's destructive pieces and others like it, in which artists of the 1960s and 1970s destroyed precious, often valuable musical instruments as they blended absurd and anarchic events with the elimination of precious objects from art, while also making sublimated symbolic statements about violence in the era of the Vietnam War.19 A great number of neo-Dada, Fluxus, destruction, and happenings artists used a blend of spontaneity, inde- terminacy, and danger as resources for performance-based com- mentaries about institutionalized violence. Within Fluxus, amongst a group of artists who were renowned for their spontaneity and absurdist gestures, Nam June Paik was one of the most notorious contributors. Because of Paik's violent, chaotic, and anarchic performances, Allan Kaprow provocatively described him as a "cultural terrorist."20 In his performance of his Etude for Pianoforte (1960) , Paik played a piece by Chopin, broke into tears, ran off stage, threatened composerjohn Cage (who was sitting in the audience) with a pair of scissors, sprayed him with shaving cream, and eventually ended his assault by cutting off the com- poser's tie in a playful gesture.21 Cage claimed to have been truly scared at the moment of Paik's confrontation with him. Though he admired Paik, and in fact mentored a number of his Fluxus compa- triots, Cage was always bothered by their violence. For a number of Fluxus artists, however, this physical, embodied, and violent inter- action with objects was significant as a means of reconfiguring the artist's (as well as the public's) relationship to art objects (and to the physical world in general) because of its sensorial force and its sym- bolic meaning. In 1962, Nam June Paik performed composer La Monte Young's event score for his Composition 1960 #10. The script for the work contained only the following simple statement: "Draw a straight line / and follow it."22 For his performance of the piece, Paik dipped his head in a mixture of tomatojuice and ink - alluding to both human physicality (with tomatojuice as a surrogate for blood) and the artist's craft - and made a long mark on paper, leaving a partial visual transcription of his act. Paik gave this object the title Zen for Heady thus differentiating the visual transcript of his action from both its score and its performance. In his transformation of one</page><page sequence="12">430 Carlos Kase ¿4 u £ g z С "č3 -С X 3 E л сч Oí 1 .g "о £ сл ГЙ 'л CU V с 3 ^-5 s л Z СЛ СЛ i U У и s CL Z г&gt; i? ® а &gt; о л о С и '£ H il- ls 3 О 'и -С 3 Û- Ï* £®2 О - U -Г О Q- CO« а - В&gt;* £ U</page><page sequence="13">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live " 431 medium into another, Paik enacted a thoughtful renovation of aes- thetic boundaries by converting a score into an action and an act into an index. What remains of Paik's performance are two evidentiary accounts of the event, each necessarily incomplete in some sense, including a photograph taken by Peter Moore, and the aforemen- tioned ink-on-paper trace. Art historian David Joselit has described one of the central strategies of Fluxus as one in which "objects are reframed as events."23 It might also be suggested that in a number of cases, including the one just described, the work forcefully reframed events as objects. In this sense, through the tracing of a performance and its unique contingencies, these works converted ephemeral and contingent historical actions into frozen visual patterns. This par- ticular variety of transformation from one medium into another is central to the artistic strategy of Guitar Drag, as well. By provoking some meditation on what constitutes an artwork - is it the score, the performance, or its documentation? - a number of artists of this era, including Paik and his major influence, John Cage, simultaneously provoked significant considerations of the limits of traditional understandings of authorship and craft. The artists of the Fluxus group were very much inspired by the teachings of Cage, and a number of their experiments in reframing the meaning of artworks can be linked to ideas and efforts under- taken earlier by their teacher. In 1951, Cage collaborated with visual artist Robert Rauschenberg on a work titled Automobile Tire Print. In this encounter, they produced a piece that was graphically, concep- tually, and ontologically related to Paik's Zen for Head. In this unusual partnership, John Cage drove one ink-covered tire of his Ford Model A across a series of twenty paper sheets, leaving a linear trace of his action while Rauschenberg directed him to follow a straight line. The work is a study into the possible interactions between con- trolled direction and uncontrollable contingency within the limits of an arbitrarily framed field experiment in which two humans attempt to make a somewhat precious visual work with the most blunt of painterly tools. Like Paik's Zen for Head - and Guitar Drag, as well - it was an event performed with the deliberate intention of cre- ating an art object that would be the trace of a contingent, somewhat uncontrollable performance action.24 Automobile Tire Print, Zen for Head, and Guitar Drag are concep- tual works that functioned in ways directly related, both in histori- cal origin and conceptual focus, to artist and theorist Allan Kaprow's influential interpretation of Jackson Pollock. For him, Pollock's brushstrokes were traces of an act or an event that in some</page><page sequence="14">432 Carlos Kase ways exceeded the textual limits of the paintings themselves. In 1958, Kaprow wrote that a proper understanding of Pollock's work requires an awareness of both his embodied practice as an act in time and a visual recognition of the painted object, "an identifica- tion with the hands and body that flung the paint and stood 'in' the canvas and submission to the objective markings."25 Like Pollock's brushstrokes, these works by Young/Paik and Rauschenberg/ Cage performed a kind of symbolic instantiation of the tensions between spontaneity and composition, between events and objects, between presence and plasticity. In these works, in their curious blending of control and contingency, the force of chance is inevitably present, be it in an effort to make an art print with one's head or with a car tire. Similarly, in Marclay's decision to make music by dragging a guitar behind a truck, he could control few precise details of the piece, thus making the chance encounters between guitar and pavement the primary determining force in the final video and sound texts. In fact, Marclay could closely control only one factor of the performance, its duration - while its pitch, dynamics, and rhythm were determined by the uncontrolled scraping of different textures of earth and asphalt upon various parts of the guitar.26 Guitar Drag, Documentary, and the Problem of Presence Guitar Drag is a document of an art event that is symbolically laden with weighty social commentary, and since it is edited and assem- bled with the intention of reconfiguring reality for rhetorical and artistic purposes, it has an argumentative function. In this regard, Guitar Drag shares as much with the conventional dramatic struc- tures of observational nonfiction filmmaking as it does with fine art.27 In addition to being an art object that sonically and symboli- cally references the rebellious and at times destructive energies of rock and roll, Guitar Drag is a contemporary artist's "creative treat- ment of actuality" and thus a transposition of the concerns of Gri- ersonian documentary.28 Like the event-object transformations described earlier in this essay, Guitar Drag-presents the conversion of a historically contingent (significantly, sonic) event, rife with indeterminacies and accidents, into a frozen trace of these once, at least partially, unpredictable per- formative possibilities. Though we have no way of knowing the dura- tion of the original event in which the guitar was destroyed, it does seem, from the visual evidence, that this video is not a real-time doc- ument of its true duration. For example, it is unclear how many takes</page><page sequence="15">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live" 433 Figure 4. Christian Marclay, Guitar Drag (2000). were used in this video and how continuous or discontinuous the actual profilmic event actually was. In fact, it is impossible to know, from the textual evidence, whether the images that we see necessar- ily correspond historically to the sounds that we hear. The artist has assured the author of this essay that sound in Guitar Drag is entirely synchronous.29 Nonetheless, there are moments when we see dis- tinctive edits in the image and jumps in the profilmic action without any modifications of the soundtrack. Guitar Drag was filmed by four camera persons, one of whom was the artist himself. At the beginning of the video, the man who prepares the guitar and drives the truck looks to be Marclay (though his identity is purposefully obscured by the framing of the image). So, if he too is a camera operator in the piece, at some point there must have been a switching of roles and therefore a break in the temporal continuity of the sonic event. As is clear from the video's numerous camera positions and its mixed soundtrack, it was assembled from a variety of visual and sonic sources and is not a continuous performance. These technical details are evidence of the artist's manipulation of the event in order to create a text with dramatic - not historical - unity. This vantage point has been neglected by all written consid- erations of this video installation; each of its commentators has naively considered the relationship between the performance event</page><page sequence="16">434 Carlos Kase and the video text to be spatiotemporally coextensive, as though the final work were an unedited, unmixed document. Nonfiction film- making tends to produce audiovisual mediations that give the impression of real-life continuities, though in actuality, underneath this facade, they are Frankensteinian objects, grafted together from temporally and spatially disjunct histories. Guitar Drag is no excep- tion. What we find here are fragments of sonic chaos, images of acci- dental encounters between guitar and pavement, conjoined and contained within an audiovisual object to create an illusion of dra- matic continuity. In an understated way, and by virtue of its dependence on mon- tage, Guitar Drag shares some subtle properties with Marclay 's more obviously collage-based visual work. In his "Body Mix" series of col- lages (1991-92), the artist used LP covers featuring the human form and stitched them together with a sewing machine to produce new disjunct, often hybridized bodies without masking the edits, thus call- ing attention to the points of juncture, a fact that differentiates these openly collagic works from Guitar Drag. These "Body Mix" works provocatively merge different genders and races to form artificially constructed blends of diverse bodies while mixing a variety of pho- tographic genres. No one would mistake Marclay's combination of Jim Morrison's torso with a scantily clad unidentified woman's pelvis for a unified, historically true form, but, in many descriptions of Gui- tar Drag, the video is equated with the profilmic event, as though the dragging of the guitar and not its representation, were the work. This is partially a result of the relative fluidity of Marclay 's editing of sound and picture but is also a function of the imprecision with which many art critics and historians approach moving-image media. This mis- take of equating the edited film object with an imagined historical unity - the video installation vs. the dragging of the guitar - is not dissimilar from an occasion in which a film critic might confuse a Hollywood movie with its story, completely disregarding its status as a crafted aesthetic object. This slippage in understanding neglects the historical, aesthetic, and particularly ontological conditions by which a moving image artwork comes to be. In her book on the relationship between cinema and time, film theorist Mary Anne Doane describes the medium in terms that are relevant for the investigation here. Doane notes that film, by its very definition, is always already forced to balance the contingency of the world with the organization of textual systems - a binary that she refers to as "events" vs. "structure."30 Historically, much film and video of performance art has tended to be shot by a single camera and presented in unedited form - as in the case of Vito Acconci 's</page><page sequence="17">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live" 435 Pryings (1971) - with the intention of foregrounding the profilmic event, rather than the crafty manipulation of the image's structure by the filmmaker and/or editor.31 Even though many commentators on Guitar Drag have described it as a coherent performance piece, what the work actually presents is a significant shift in mediation from the 1970s model of documenting performance, of balancing events and structure. Though Guitar Drag resembles the historical documentation of performance in its contingency and the seeming singularity of its event, it is a contingency that has been manipulated using the stylistic tropes of observational nonfiction - handheld cameras, location sound, inconspicuous camera operators and tech- nicians, and the use of montage and framing for dramatic effect - to give the impression of immediacy and continuity. However, what is at stake here is not simply the consideration of the medium's evi- dentiary claims but a fundamental ontological distinction between presence and plasticity, particularly as it informs differences between traditions of performance art and filmmaking. As already mentioned, most published descriptions of Guitar Drag give the impression that the musical performance event has been mediated rather transparently across history - from the past to the present without incident. (The work's impression of trans- parency, its deliberate effacing of its own construction, is something that it shares with traditions of industrial cinema.) As art and per- formance historians Anne Wagner and Peggy Phelan have argued, there is something fundamental to performance that cannot be transported across the temporal, historical, and ontological distance that separates the live event from its representation and replay on video, film, etc.32 This ontological factor is presence: it is that which can be recognized only by the traces that it leaves upon the medium of its representation. The idiosyncrasies, the noise, the accidents, the indeterminacy of these traces - the indexes of a contingency that exceeds authorial control - mark the excess that confirms that they once shared space with an unpredictable, unique, and feeling body that interacted with the flux of the world, like that of Namjune Paik or even, in a much more tragic context, James Byrdjr. In the works described in this essay, chance created a condition of possi- bility - for different sounds, different forms, and different results - that cannot be recuperated or even assimilated into the mediated moving-image texts. Active chance, like human presence itself, can exist only in the present. Peggy Phelan has theorized a variety of performance art, known as "hardship art" or "ordeal art," that directly addresses the onto- logical distinction between bodily presence and the impossibility of</page><page sequence="18">436 Carlos Kase actually representing it through a marked use of suffering and vio- lence visited on the body of the performer. It is work that attempts to invoke a distinction between presence and representation by using the singular body as a metonymy for the apparently nonreciprocal experience of pain. . . . The promise of this performance then is to learn to value what is lost, to learn not the meaning but the value of what cannot be reproduced or seen (again) . It begins with the knowledge of its own fail- ure, that it cannot achieved.33 In the live hardship art discussed by Phelan, performing bodies enact a failure of translation and a recognition of that which is lost, the "once-was" of contingent presence that cannot be regained or reanimated through any medium. Though a mediating work can make us aware of historical contingency by showing its traces, it is no longer literally contingent and thus cannot contain or incorporate the rich historical fullness of the event by virtue of its inactive his- torical relationship to the past. Mary Anne Doane convincingly argues that there is an ontological excess in the event that cannot be recorded or contained. She writes, "[A]ny event is by its nature that which is inassimilable." She argues that the irreducible ontological excess of an event "serves as an assurance of the real."34 It may be sug- gested, following Doane, that this excess (which is beyond repro- duction) provides a potential counterargument to Cartesian skepticism (of Meditations) as it assures us of the existence of the real in its demonstration that the representation of a historical fact can never actually replicate the active contingency and chance that were once operative upon its production. A video or film is a stable tex- tual object that will not change, and therefore chance is no longer an operative force in any audiovisual recording as it unfolds in time. Indeterminacy is ontologically related to presence in that it is some- thing that was once historically potent and real, but now, once it has passed, is lost and beyond the representational limits of reproduc- tion and replay.35 In some ways, the concerns of hardship art and body art (as described by Phelan) are related to those of Marclay 's Guitar Drag. By substituting a symbolic nonliving object for the suffering body of a person, Marclay has already consciously acknowledged a historical incommensurability between bodies and mediums of representa- tion. Guitar Drag enacts this failure of translation directly through the aforementioned symbolic substitution. In addition, through its uses of chance and indeterminacy as performance factors, the work reminds us of its historical contingency and its direct involvement in the unpredictable flux of the Texas landscape and the history that</page><page sequence="19">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live " 43 1 has been inscribed upon it. That Guitar Drag is partially determined by forces of chance and indeterminacy is a recognition of their potency to leave unique, once-contingent traces of presence, though, as Marclay is himself aware, it is a presence that can be only hinted at. Chance, like presence, always exceeds the ontological lim- its of audiovisual representation. When viewing and listening to Gui- tar Drag , we are made aware of a chance-based process that once brought a musical performance into being, though technically that chance is no longer operative. In this encounter with traces of an uncontrolled action from the past, we are made aware of an inas- similable plenitude of performative liveness, which is its historical condition of possibility. We can no more reexperience the histori- cally active chance of the work's coming into being through its rep- etition in video projection than we can reanimate the once-living body ofjames Byrd Jr. By removing the performing musician or the suffering victim of extreme racial violence from his reenactment, Marclay has created a degree of rhetorical distance from the historical tragedy itself. How one interprets this distance will directly affect the ways in which Gui- tar Drags tone is understood. For example, to some this symbolic shift may suggest a degree of irony in relation to guitar destruction in pop- ular culture. Tone is difficult to trace in work as enigmatic and open- ended as this. Yet, in the sheer volume and visceral, sonic impact of the work, Guitar Drag offers its audience access to another set of aesthetic signifiers that are particular to the cultural practice of rock and roll, and that thus have the potential to trigger an entirely dif- ferent set of potentially cathartic emotional associations. Though these details may not be connected in any direct way to the historical tragedy itself, they are capable of evoking extreme responses of emo- tion and sensation - what Marclay has described as exhilaration - and thus of pitching the work itself within a register of affect that bleeds beyond the limits of the text itself into the private space of the spectator's personal associations. By staging this sonic event as a historical and conceptual encounter with the horrific murder ofjames Byrdjr., the video's eth- ical and political stakes obliquely intensify every affective detail that is implicitly or explicitly inscribed within it, be it one associated with rock-and-roll timbres, the anarchic energy of Fluxus, or the terrible history of racism in America. The historical factor of chance in the work's performance is no longer operative in the video's projection, and so, likejames Byrd's life and its corporal presence, it exceeds the frame of the moving-image work and cannot be recuperated. This is its essence as an act of mourning, an acknowledgment of something</page><page sequence="20">438 Carlos Kase lost that cannot be recovered. The work's consideration of this trau- matic, senseless, and untouchable event reflects on an ethical dis- grace without instrumentalizing it, by demonstrating that the representation of death, like the passing of life itself, is, in the words of André Bazin, an "ontological obscenity."36 Conclusion: "A New Type of Sound" Guitar Drag is a video installation and sound work that evokes the radical combination of sensory discomfort and conceptual rapture of structural film and minimalist music. In fact, it is available both as a video installation and as a one-sided LP (which is identical to the video's soundtrack) . As a piece of sound art, it is an experiment that asks quite simply, what would it sound like to drag an amplified elec- tric guitar across a Texas landscape? It is clear on one level that the piece, as Marclay has suggested, is "about a desire to create a new type of sound" through a field experiment in noise and indetermi- nacy by using one of the most distinctive timbres of rock and roll.37 Before beginning the project, it would have been difficult for the artist to know precisely what kind of sounds an electric guitar might make as it is dragged across terrain of uneven textures at various angles and shifting speed and direction. In this sense, it is an exper- iment in uncontrolled encounters between an electric guitar and the geologic idiosyncrasies of the landscape of San Antonio. Like so much post-Cagean music and performance, Guitar Drag thus fore- grounds the operations of chance and, as such, makes significant modifications to traditional notions of authorship by presenting an uncontrolled and violent event, with all its accidental details, as the primary determining mechanism for the work. In both its observational form and its humanist message, Guitar Drag has assimilated certain details of conventional documentary practice. But in the process of transposing the tragic murder of James Byrdjr. into the realm of an artwork, Marclay has used a struc- ture of metaphor, a kind of substitution that is more common to art - as in the examples of much Fluxus work - than it is to the more didactic practices of conventional documentary filmmaking.38 Marclay has placed a number of conflicting discourses into a multifarious and unstable interaction within the textual field of the work, an approach that produces a crisis of interpretation as it con- tinually generates a variety of unanswerable questions: If Marclay is indeed mocking the heroic, masculine gestures of a performed rock-and-roll violence by removing the musician entirely, how can</page><page sequence="21">"This Guitar Has Seconds to Live" 439 he at the same time use the mass-produced electric guitar - the work's possible symbolic object of ridicule - as a surrogate for the bodily traumas of a recently murdered victim of racial violence? If the work is indeed about the horrors of racial violence, how can it also address the clichés of rock-and-roll performance? And, ulti- mately, if it is a critical work meant to call our attention to the con- tinuing injustice of racism, how can it also be pleasurable? The extreme conceptual dissonance between these different registers - event vs. object, chance vs. control, pleasure vs. horror - produces a work of radical bricolage in which incompatible registers of mean- ing violently clash, both conceptually and sensorially, producing an experience that culminates in a multitiered awareness of their very differences, as well as the incommensurability of bodily presence and its audiovisual representation. Acknowledgments I thank Ivone Margulies for her input and commentary upon a much earlier version of this essay that was presented in the spring of 2008 at the annual conference of the Society for Cinema and Media Studies in Philadelphia. James Leo Cahill and the editors of this spe- cial issue of Discourse were also extremely helpful. In fact, I have incorporated a number of their suggestions and ideas into this essay. I thank them for their input, which was not insignificant. However, I must admit that any and all inconsistencies or flaws in the essay are entirely my own.

G. Allin and Wendy O. Williams, whose liminal musical theatrics - in their distinct ways - tested the bounds of even the most radical taste in their blending of bodily excesses of the most pornographic, scatological, and criminally combative varieties. 6 In the late 1970s, experimental filmmaker and collage artist Bruce Conner began to document the chaos of punk-rock performance in San Francisco and often explained that his work was a variety of combat photography - a descriptive metaphor that directly calls attention to both the violence and the dangerous unpredictability of live punk rock. 7 Douglas Kahn, "Christian Marclay s Early Years: An Interview," Leonardo Music Journal 13 (2003): 17-21, quotation on 19. 8 Roselee Goldberg, Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present (New York: Harry Abrams, 1988), 180. 9 Ibid., 183. 10 Jimi Hendrix's iconic performance was filmed by D.

Nam June Paik had destroyed violins on a number of occasions and in a variety of contexts.

Rauschenberg said of Cage, "He did a beau- tiful job, but I consider it my print." John Cage responded by saying, "But which one of us drove the car?" (quoted in Mary Lynn Kotz, Rauschenberg: Art and Life [New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2004], 72-73). 25 Allan Kaprow, "The Legacy of Jackson Pollock," in Essays on the Blurring of Art and Life , ed.

However, it can be argued that a performance, musical or otherwise, if it takes place in a studio, in a concert hall, or in a field in San Antonio, still consti- tutes a performance (e-mail correspondence with the artist via Paul Cooper Gallery, New York City, 2008). 28 John Grierson used this phrase in many articles. The first appearance of this phrase was likely in 1933, in his "The Documentary Producer," Cinema Quarterly 2, no. 1 (1933): 7-9, quotation on 8. 29 E-mail correspondence with the artist (see note 27). 30 Mary Ann Doane, The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency , the Archive (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002), 167. It is fair to extend these conditions in some degree to video, as well, or to any consideration of moving- image media that functions as an automatic, mechanized recording apparatus. 31 Art historian Anne Wagner wrote about the issues of truth and authenticity in the interaction between early video art and performance. For her, much of the most significant work, including that of Acconci, Dan Graham, and Joan Jonas self- consciously parades the medium's inability to convey real selfhood and truth. She expresses a fundamental skepticism toward the possibility of representing an authen- tic subjectivity in video because media prevents "gears of selfhood from being able to engage" ("Performance, Video, and the Rhetoric of Presence," October9l [2000]: 59- 80, esp. 80).</page><page sequence="24">442 Carlos Kase 32 See ibid., 59-80; and Peggy Phelan, Unmarked: The Politics of Performance (Lon- don: Routledge, 1993). 33 Phelan, Unmarked , 152. 34 Doane, Emergence of Cinematic Time, 140. 35 Though profllmic chance is no longer operative once the event has been recorded and transposed into an audiovisual text, still other contingencies always remain active as long as the work interacts with people in space and time: these are the variable factors of exhibition and reception that inevitably create a diverse range of reactions to, and interpretations of, media art. It is also worth noting here that film and video are physical objects that, like the human body, are impermanent and subject to the unavoidable temporal passage from being to absence. Though they are records of past events, they, too, like the actions that they represent, will eventually pass into nonbeing. 36 André Bazin describes the representation of real death in documentary cin- ema as "an intolerable sight not so much for its objective horror as for its ontological obscenity" ("Death Every Afternoon," trans.
