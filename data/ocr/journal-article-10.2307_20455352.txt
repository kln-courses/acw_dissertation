<plain_text><page sequence="1">Parroting and the Periodical: Women's Speech, Haywood's Parrot, and its Antecedents Manushag N. Powell Purdue University In July 1709, the Female Tatler, a gossipy and moralizing periodical, ran the following notice: A very agreeable young Lady at Epsom, having made Complaint that an impudent Parrot, on Clay-hill, whenever she happens to pass by, is always bawling, When did you see Captain Thumper, Oh! the dear Captain, the pretty, pretty Captain, till she was forc'd to remove her Lodgings, tho she knows not, nor ever heard of any such Captain. The Gentleman believes the Parrot meant her no Affront, humbly begs her Pardon, and henceforward, Poll shall have less Victuals than formerly, that he may not be so very Pert, and be hung next to the Garden instead of the Street.1 Although the gentleman owner faults the parrot, the reader might well conclude either that the "very agreeable young Lady" is really a bit of a fool for not comprehending the aimlessness of the parrot's blather, or that one of the humans involved protests too much.2 It is not, and probably cannot, be known whether this is indeed a genuine apology from a reader of the Female Tatler, or whether it is simply a humorous composition by the periodical's author, a figure styled under the persona of "Phoebe Crackenthorpe, a lady that knows everything."3 The notice is thus plausi ble to the modem reader both as a credible vignette of eighteenth-century life, and as a literary creation whose main thrust is not very complimentary to women.4 Furthermore, the parrot in the notice, though belonging to a man, is aligned with women's speech in its ceaseless repetition of a poten tially damaging piece of gossip. This "parrot note" demonstrates a number of connections among women, speech, periodicals, and parrots. Two issues stand opposed to each other: women, as publishers, authors, and readers, were indispensable con tributors to the periodical scene in eighteenth-century England.5 However, professional authorship was nonetheless imagined to be a matter for men, at least at its best. Therefore, when the feminine is invoked in discourses of periodical authorship, it is most often a vehicle for complaint: the idea is that periodicals are so proliferate and so vapid as to mimic women's speech, with gossip masquerading as didacticism. A graphic 1752 reference to "those Menstrual Eruptions from the Press, called Magazines" showcases 63</page><page sequence="2">this unfortunate link, particularly since it appears in a work purportedly written by one man against another.6 Periodicals, which frequently figure themselves (if not their competitors) as literary endeavors, tend often to associate women with speech that is low, nonedifying, rhetorically unsophisticated, gossipy-the sort of thing, in short, one expects from a parrot. Valued for its beauty as well as ability, the parrot was renowned for speaking articulately, but without sense or discrimination, and for this reason became a common deprecatory metaphor for threatening figures of alterity like social climbers, racial "others," and women who speak out or write improperly. Although obviously an exotic pet, the talking parrot, rather like the woman author, was by no means an unheard-of phenomenon in either life or literature of eighteenth-century England. Of course, challenges were occasionally mounted against this long-standing connection. Eliza Haywood's periodical, the Parrot, with a Compendium of the Times,7 is an exception to the misogynistic parrot tradition, wherein she cleverly invokes the talking parrot in a genre that is already specifi cally enabled by the metaphor of the female voice. Although hampered by social conventions that increasingly treated certain kinds of speech (politi cal, for example, not to mention public) as outside the natural province of women, feminine speech (tattling, prattling, prating, babbling) was, paradoxically enough, often invoked in the periodicals that admonished and shaped that society. As a modern critic notices, "Rhetorically feminine periodicals employ women personae, or eidolons, symbolically to represent both generic affiliation and the relationship between publication and the public sphere" (Osell, p. 283).8 The existence of this posture of rhetorical (artificial) femininity is what allows the seeming contradiction that, in Rachel Camell's words, "Eliza Haywood advised women, in her conduct books, to keep silent about their political opinions in the household even as she protested, in her periodical writings, women's exclusions from the political debates of the public sphere."9 Because of the connection between women and gossipy, unthink ing speech, the parrot becomes an apt choice for a feminine eidolon in England's busy periodical culture, and in fact not one but two periodicals entitled the Parrot were published in the first half of the eighteenth cen tury. The first was an anonymous creation by "Penelope Prattle" in 1728,10 while the second was authored by the well-known Haywood in 1746. Neither was a spectacular success (although in an age when periodicals often died after a single issue, any multiplicity of numbers is something), but both have survived. This essay examines the issue of women and gen der roles in the essay periodical as it is articulated through the gendered device of the talking parrot, and it attempts to come to an understanding of how this connection was informed by an already-rich tradition of par 64</page><page sequence="3">rots in literature. It will finish by reading Haywood's efforts, in the Parrot, to recover from the misogynistic representations of women's speech in works like the 1728 Parrot by embracing and underscoring the value of prattle-parrot talk-to the essay periodical. The "Parrot Archive" The appearance of talking parrots in the essay periodical is conversant with long traditions from many literatures. The reader of eighteenth-cen tury texts will easily remember Crusoe's parrot companion and Sterne's woefully imprisoned starling, but there are numerous other examples of parrots in English print culture, not only in novels but also in poetry, fables, balladry, and, obviously, periodicals. Generally speaking, the talk ing parrot in these works is valuable to some and dangerous to others for the same reason: it reveals information about its society without regard to rules of decorum or discretion, and this information is frequently linked to women's sexual power and proclivities. Parrots are thus often associ ated with the salacious and illicit. In the Parroting periodicals, however, the parrot is used in conjunction with female voices as a satirical agent that helps the authors adopt risky political, rather than sexual, stances: the 1728 Parrot is clearly anti-Walpole, and the 1746 is cautiously pro Jacobite. The parrot becomes in these texts an agent for truth and edifica tion rather than a mere pretty pet and signifier of the boudoir, though of course those associations, which will become obvious as we examine the parrot archive, do remain. For example, a 1668 work called Psittacorum Regio: The Land of the Parrots: Or, the She-Lands invoked the old cartographer's name for Brazil to introduce a fictitious travel narrative about a land dominated economi cally, politically, and socially by women.11 The work was not original but an adaptation and abridgement of John Healey's Discovery of a New World (1609), itself a loose translation of Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem (1605). The interpolation of the parrot into the title in this new English version of an older Latin work neatly points to a pre-existent symbolic con nection among parrots, contact with the exotic, and women whom men would rather avoid or turn into jokes. Similarly, but in a different "land of the parrots," the narrator of the fictional travel narrative A Trip to the Moon complains, "[t]he only Fault I could find with them, was, that they were too talkative, like Women, constantly asking impertinent Questions. "12 This is an ungrateful remark to make of the birds who have been feeding and sustaining him while he is lost in the wilderness. Although evidently a compelling formulation, The Land of the Parrots is hardly the only or the earliest literary link between women and the birds to appear in England. Parrots also appear classically, in Aristotle and Pliny, Plutarch and Aesop; 65</page><page sequence="4">and Ovid's elegy for Corinna's parakeet in the Amores would have been an obvious example of the confluence of the two creatures (women and par rots) known to many eighteenth-century English readers.-3 As in the European literary tradition, the parrot is a recurring figure in other literatures, including Indian, Persian, Egyptian, and Arabian, wherein its ability to converse makes it a useful narrative device. The "par rot tale" was common enough that it might be called a comic subgenre of the "oriental tale," which was, for eighteenth-century European readers, a substantial body of literature popularized through translations, adapta tions, and mimicry in French and English. As is the case in Haywood's periodical, parrots could not only speak, but could even become the nar rators in oriental tales. For example, in the frame story of a collection called the Tales of a Parrot (Ziya'u'd-din Nakhshabi's Tuti-nama, partially translated into English near the end of the eighteenth century),"4 Tuti the parrot tricks his mistress into de facto faithfulness by telling her stories to keep her from visiting her lover until her absent husband can return.15 In this case, the successful parrot inverts the Scheherazade story, in which the narrator tells tales to prevent her own execution and save other innocent women from peremptory condemnation for unfaithfulness, by taking as its starting point the perjury of women and attempting to counteract it. To continue with Scheherazade, in one case of this type of parrot-and infidelity story that was probably known to many English readers, the Arabian Nights (translated from Antoine Galland's Les Mille et une Nuit between 1704-17) features on the fourteenth night "The Story of the Husband and the Parrot," wherein a jealous husband sets a parrot to guard over his unfaithful wife. Too clever for them both, she fakes a storm to trick the parrot into becoming an unreliable witness (he seems to evince a tendency to talk nonsense when, in all sincerity, he reports it to her spouse), and the poor parrot falls victim to the husband's rage. Widely disseminated, this story arrived in Europe ahead of the Arabian Nights as a collected body: the husband-and-parrot motif reappears in a fourteenth century French fabliau, "The Tale of the Lady and the Three Parrots" (Boehrer, pp. 42-44). In some versions of this story, an incautious parrot is killed outright by the wife to prevent discovery, and in others the parrot outwits the wife while she is the one punished. What remains a constant is the presence of the parrots and the woman's unfaithfulness. I have suggested that English literature uses the metaphor of parrot speech to disparage women; this tendency has some precedent. Many par rot tales can be designated as belonging to the wider "Wiles of Women" category of narrative. John Perry, in his article on parrot humor, describes an East-West (Persia to India to Europe) flow of stories in which one party outwits another, generally classified as the "Wiles of Women" genre."6 These stories contain a wide variety of situations, many involving speak 66</page><page sequence="5">ing animals, especially "as both commodity and concept ... Psittacus, the friendly and intelligent green parrot of India.""7 He states, "[o]ften in these stories, Psittacus mimus, a mere copycat who craves a cracker, is promoted to Psittacus sapiens, a paragon of motivational psychology and metaphys ics, a rhetorical match for most of his or her human antagonists. (Polly's Indian antecedents are female; Persian parrots, grammatically genderless, are evidently female in most contexts; parrots in English dirty jokes are male)" (p. 64). This last note is important: particularly in English contexts that resonate with the "Wiles of Women" tradition, the speech and wit of a parrot most often show a woman's stupidity, trickery, and thoughtless ness-or, at the very least, make clear women's inherent sexual looseness (see fig. 1 ).18 It is this sexual element that Penelope Prattle presumes upon when her Parrot effeminizes English military might through her excessive and frivolous love of soldiers, and that Haywood seems to draw upon, or against, as she transitions from the Female Spectator to the Parrot. Thus both periodicals, unsurprisingly, make implicit claims through their narra tive choices about the link between women's speech and sexuality. Pet Parrots and the Women Who Love Them To a large degree, the problem of sex, women, and parrots is connected to the problem of women and pets more generally. Although their exotic coloration and origins were an obvious part of their appeal, parrots were not fundamentally alien creatures in London by the eighteenth century. Exotic bird feathers, including colorful parrot plumage, were prized as fash ion accessories and curiosities, reminding their owners of the female stake in global trade and contact."9 As pets, parrots were often present in English homes, as well as on the shoulders of sailors, serving as animal compan ions and as valuable accessories for dress and in portraiture.20 Parrots were almost always imported from the non-European continents; their resulting high cost marked them as high-status pets for the well-to-do, reinforcing the stereotype of female excesses.21 Actually, despite their exotic origins, parrots in literature were so well integrated into representations of the English home as to be depicted as both a commonality and a nuisance. When women specifically are dis cussed as pet owners, the parrot is likely to be an unwelcome rival with other humans who want her attention. Haywood herself was obviously awake to the erotic potential of pet keeping. She brings it up in several works, ranging from the plotline concerning an oversexed monkey in her oriental tale The Adventures of Eovaai (1736) to her conduct work The Wife (1756), in which the narrator Mira is most severe upon a woman who chooses the company of her bitch over her husband. Disgusted at having to share their bed with the dog, the husband eventually decides 67</page><page sequence="6">A1'm?R .L v 0.1 hA{2:f]S Ii wisth] . *M i X 1. HIE oe MA\TRI1MONV5.

In a general sense, pet keeping, though to be sure also practiced by men, is most often associated in literature with women. Many other eighteenth century authors, including eminents like Pope and Addison, complain of women's tendency misguidedly to lavish their affections on animal rather than human lovers.22 For example, Addison in Spectator 343 (3 April 1712) gives us the story of one "Jack Freelove," a "Fellow of Whim" who cleverly "made Love to one of those Ladies who throw away their Fondness on Parrots, Monkeys, and Lap-dogs" by sending her professions of adoration signed by her pet monkey (who is, it is claimed, actually a reincarnated and besotted "Indian Brachman").23 As this sort of story demonstrates, the parrot, the monkey, and the lap dog make up a triumvirate of fairly common and yet, to many minds, dis turbing pets for the affluent in the early eighteenth century. The problem with these pets, which seems to make them more worrisome than other contemporary house critters like squirrels and ferrets, is that they are both strikingly like and unlike their human masters, thus coming to represent a kind of living contact zone between the species.24 Monkeys are obvi ously anthropomorphic, dogs exhibit both intelligence and many of the emotional traits valued in human communities, and parrots, most unset tlingly, talk.25 As Keith Thomas has shown, the eighteenth century saw a major rise in pet keeping, the taking of these foreign creatures into homes, families, affections, and society (see fig. 2); pets might be fed and treated better than the household servants, dressed, loved, and even mourned in their passings more than real humans.26 "Italian grey-hounds, Dutch lap dogs, monkeys, and maccaws, have been honoured with monuments and epitaphs," notes one midcentury periodical.27 It is thus not surprising that unease and jealousy between man and ani mal comprised a common European literary motif. In her study of exotic animals in eighteenth-century French literature, Louise Robbins remarks, "[m]ale writers and artists tended to portray women's relations to their pets either lasciviously or petulantly, depending on whether the pet was a metaphor for the male lover or was an all too material rival."28 The pos sibility that a woman might be getting erotic fulfillment out of her pets was a perpetually available dirty joke for male authors. Another English peri odical, The World, suggests that parrots and other small pets might actually help keep virgins chaste, giving them an outlet for venting their physical passions. A young woman in love, says Adam Fitz-Adam, endangers her health to keep her virtue since indulgence in the passion is absolutely forbidden; the only healthy option is "substituting some other object to engross her affection." He goes on, "Thus a lap-dog, a squirrel, or a parrot may relieve her distress, by being admitted to her bosom, and receiving those douceurs [softnesses] and caresses which her passion prompts her to 69</page><page sequence="8">Figure 2, High Life at Noon (1 June 1760), Given Gratis to the Purchas ers of the Court Miscellany.

In the story of the husband and the parrot, when the tattle-tale parrot spies on his mistress canoodling with her lover and then reports to the husband, the wife's fate depends on her ability to appear a more credible speaker than the bird, but the mere fact of her infidelity is taken for granted in the story: the parrot's presence signifies this. In a variation on this theme, in the adaptation of one of Petis de la Croix's Persian Tales that appears in Spectator 578, the unfortunate Fadlallah is turned into his wife's pet nightingale and must watch helplessly from his cage every night as his rival makes love to her.30 In Jean Baptiste Louis Gresset's popular French poem, "Ver-Vert: or, the Nunnery Parrot" (1734, translated into English in 1759), Ver-Vert (sometimes "Green-Green" in the English), an Indian parrot sent from his home to a convent in Nevers "for his good" is described as the rooster among his hens.31 The parrot is "debonair, / Light, spruce, inconstant, gay, and free" (p. 10, 11. 114-15), all the nuns adore him wildly, as the "Sole licens'd male to be belov'd" (p. 10, 1. 133) among them, and he has complete freedom to roam the nunnery, receiving lots of tasty treats and caresses, and pecking the nuns "in wanton play" (p. 11, 1. 145). "No human Parrot of the court / Was fondled half so much as he" (p. 13,11. 180-81); he even spends every night in the chamber of a different nun.32 Another example of sex and parrots appears in the frame story of Alexander Dow's Tales, Translated from the Persian of Inatulla of Delhi (1768). Prince Jehandar's best friend, Jewan Sadit, is mauled by a tiger and dies, only to be reincarnated as a parrot, who, encountering his prince, "began, as it fluttered with joy, to nibble at the roses of his lips," and, upon heading home with Jehandar, engages victoriously in a battle with the Prince's mistress for control over his affections.33 Just as expressive of the amorous currents running among men, women, and birds is Tatler 27 (9 June 1709), in which Richard Steele writes of a lover who must go through his mistress's male parrot to win her heart. He sees that "Poll had [his mistress's] ear, when his sighs were neglected. To write against him, had been a fruitless labour"; therefore the man writes a poem, "To a Lady on her Parrot": When Nymphs were coy, and Love could not prevail, The Gods disguis'd were seldom known to fail, Leda was chast, but yet a Feather'd Jove Surpris'd the Fair, and taught her how to love. There's no Coelestial but his Heav'n would quit, For any Form which might to thee admit. See how the wanton Bird, at every Glance, Swells his glad Plumes, and feels an amorous Trance. 71</page><page sequence="10">The Queen of Beauty has forsook the Dove, Henceforth the Parrot be the Bird of Love.34 The poet begins by citing classical precedent for divine woman-bird amours and then implies that his would-be lover's pet relishes similar aspi rations, "swelling" when he looks at her. In another version of the same poem, the decidedly non-Platonic nature of the pet-keeper relationship is emphasized when it is suggested that the lady physically reciprocates her bird's feelings: "Prest by that Hand, he melts at ev'ry Touch; / Prest by that Hand, who wou'd not melt as much?"35 Isaac Bickerstaff, the Tatler's eidolon, concludes of the episode, "The Parrot represents us in the State of making Love: The Dove in the Possession of the Object beloved.... For he who would be loved by Women, must never be silent before the Favour, or open his Lips after it" (p. 210). It is no coincidence that the wooing detailed in Steele's anecdote is rhetorical. Parrots are associated with a profusion of uncontrollable speech, which here comes not from the bird but from the mouth of a human male whose own voice is compromised by a woman's preference for hearing her talk ing pet. The lover's recourse is to be witty, turning the woman's misplaced affections into an object of satire, and although the bachelor Bickerstaff implies that any attempt to woo a woman, who, like a parrot, is rendered an "Object," is just so much nonsensical, birdlike blathering, the lover in the story demonstrates, implicitly, the difference between his own ability with words and a parrot's, which the lady has foolishly missed: he, not Poll, can compose heroic couplets.36 This episode suggests that both pets and lovers may gain access to women through language. For a woman to prefer parrot-speech to man-speech is immature and onanistic, and for a man to woo such a woman is effeminizing, a degradation in which he must find a way to speak to a creature not really able to appreciate his intelligence. Although the Tatler's parrot is no intellectual threat, in many pet par rot tales and, as we shall soon see, in Haywood's Parrot, "Psittacus mimus, a mere copycat who craves a cracker, is promoted to Psittacus sapiens," in Perry's words, "a paragon of motivational psychology and metaphysics, a rhetorical match for most of his or her human antagonists" (p. 64). For the philosophers John Locke and David Hume it becomes important to differentiate between a parrot's articulate speech and the essence of what it is to be human. The transformation to which Perry points, from Psittacus mimus to Psittacus sapiens, is precisely what they seek to deny. Thus, the juxtaposition of human and parrot speech is borne out in less playful con texts as well. Indeed, taken to their logical conclusions, their statements about parroting's difference from speech might suggest to contemporary minds the devaluation of any language used as "womanly" prattle. In book 2, chapter 27 of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding 72</page><page sequence="11">(1690), Locke includes a story from the Memoirs of Sir William Temple, describing at length an encounter between Prince Maurice and an alleg edly "rational" parrot in Brazil. The parrot, very large and old, begins his display by remarking, What a company of white men are here? They asked it what he thought that Man was, pointing at the Prince? It answered, Some General or other; when they brought it close to him, he asked it, D'ou venes vous? it answered, De Marinnan. The Prince, A qui estes vous? The Parrot, Je garde les poulles. The Prince laughed and said, Vous gardez les poulles? The Parrot answered, Ouy, moy et je scay bien faire; and made the Chuck four or five times that People used to make to Chickens when they call them.37 The parrot makes great claims for rationality by showing himself aware of human social status. He sees the prince as a man of rank, knows his iden tity to be tied to his employment, and takes pride in his work ("je scay bien faire"; I know well how to do it). He also shows himself naturally elevated above the other, speechless birds: when he herds the chickens, he speaks not, like Dr. Dolittle's Polynesia, as one of them, but instead as a human chicken keeper would.38 Although the parrot is quoted here in French, as Prince Maurice spoke to Temple, Locke goes on to quote enough of the story to make clear that it (if it really existed) actually used Portuguese, and was doubly translated to the prince, by a Brazilian who spoke Dutch, and a Dutchman who spoke Portuguese. This is not an "intelligent rational" (English) parrot.39 The linguistic barriers show the degree to which rational discourse with a parrot is compromised here: although Locke seems willing to countenance the story, the excessive mediation of the parrot speech acts as a buffer for the reader who wants reasonable doubt. Indeed, elsewhere Locke reasons, "God having designed Man for a sociable Creature" gave him language, which is more than the generation of sound, but that "Parrots ... will be taught to make articulate Sounds distinct enough, which yet, by no means, are capable of Language" (book 3, part 1, p. 402). Later in the century, Hume makes concrete the links among European defensiveness, thoughtless speech, parrots, and the presence of alterity. In a now infamous remark from his essay "Of National Characters" (1747, the note in question was added 1753-54), Hume states, "In Jamaica indeed they talk of one Negro as a man of parts and learning; but 'tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly."40 Like Locke, Hume mediates his engagement with the par roting object, admitting he has no direct knowledge of Francis Williams, and wanting to deny the possibility of intelligence where he thinks none should be. The comparison between the Jamaican and parrots resonates with women and parrots, and it echoes the statement made by Jonathan 73</page><page sequence="12">Swift that "A very little Wit is valued in a Woman, as we are pleas'd with a few Words spoken plain by a Parrot."41 Women, Swift suggests, cannot really produce much wit but are more likely, parrot-like, to reproduce it from others; if we push Locke's standard to the extreme, this would make them incapable of real language. The problem Swift leaves out of his comparison is that while parrots, like women, were widely denounced throughout the eighteenth century as mindless repeaters of hearsay, the issue was not merely that they had few words but that they could be distressingly garrulous, repeating their scandal (as in the case of Captain Thumper, with which I began this essay) with delighted abandon. Even when it is not witty, women's speech, like parrot speech, is hard for men to control: both learn a few words, and then will not be silenced. Hume's echo of Swift, I'd suggest, links white English women to the racialized, unthinking-though-articulate Other, while at the same moment enabling Hume to associate Francis Williams with a feminized, nonhuman animal. None of these entities, supposedly, can truly generate and express thought; instead, they only reproduce and mimic its appearance. Women can reproduce sexually and, through rumor mongering, even reproduce sex, but these are animal rather than rational generations. Parrots in the Periodicals It is the paradigm of the brainless feminine chatterer that Penelope Prattle is invoking when she names her periodical after her pet par rot-which, she is very careful to point out, is in fact a hen parrot. The exceptional presence of a distinctly female Poll serves to underscore the author's point, that women, or at least women like Penelope, are parrots, united in a sisterhood of tattle and mere repetition. Haywood, in contrast, will return to the model of the male parrot, the more traditional figure who in oriental tales and animal fables speaks with skill and purpose. Prattle's work begins with a formulaic introduction of the eidolon (the periodical's author-persona) and plan of the periodical. She acknowledges the crowd ing of the field but begs room for one more voice: "I Hope the World will not be so rude as to demand a Reason at a Woman's Hands, why she should assume the Character of an Intelligencer, and set Pen to Paper at this Time of Day, when the Number of Journals and News Letters are even cumber some to Shops and Coffee-houses." Part of the problem, she alleges, is that periodical papers are grown so political that their contents have become suspect and "Every Head is now teeming with Politicks, and will be apt to run askew, unless some regulating Hand interpose, to prevent the World's being baffled by these Saturday See-Saws. The Design of this Undertaking is to keep Things to Rights."42 Prattle is facetiously positioned as a lone 74</page><page sequence="13">righteous female seeking to balance between politically interested male eidolons like Caleb d'Anvers and Roger Manley.43 Prattle is being disingenuous here: it soon becomes clear that the female voice is being invoked to further a politically opinionated paper. It would have been rather predictable to the experienced periodical reader that, although she claims, "I am a Retainer to no Party nor Interest, but Truth alone is my Steerage," by the end of the first paper Prattle is attacking, tongue-in-cheek, Roger Manley and his ministry periodical, the British Journal (1727/1728-29).44 The problem is his (to her) too-lukewarm sup port of Walpole's controversial policy of maintaining a standing army: Prattle favors the army in part on the grounds that women find soldiers so omamentally desirable. Later the Parrot publishes an epitaph gleefully celebrating the short-lived demise of the Jacobite Mist's Weekly Journal (Parrot 2, 2 October 1728),45 and it also registers the "Norfolk Lanthom" tussle (Parrot 3, 9 October 1728),46 all while, of course, claiming political disinterest. The Parrot itself, it gradually unfolds, is pointedly political and firmly anti-Walpole; even in the first issue none of its many compli ments toward the minister's army are anything better than extremely back-handed ("What supports the Gold Lace and Embroidery Business?" Soldiers, of course). Her pleas in favor of Walpole's soldiers disqualify themselves because of the mouthpiece from which they issue. Her first motto, a familiar military crest, "Nec Aspera Terrent" (undaunted by dif ficulties) underscores the absurdity of a woman's taking up the defense of soldiers in this manner. Titling the work the Parrot alerts the reader to the fact that misogyny will be the enabling key to the text's satirical ventures; the soldiers' worth is called into question precisely because Prattle likes them so much. The ironic undoing of the text is a useful hedge to be able to make since openly criticizing the administration could be risky business,47 and to praise through an idiotic and inappropriate mouthpiece might seem a safer venture. Parroting also works as a political shield, with the parrot able to say what the author cannot because his own absurdity provides deniability and distance between the text and the author. Even after the demise of the second Parrot, periodicals evidently still found this substitution to be viable. In the Connoisseur, Mr. Town has an animal fable dream in which a parrot is put on trial "for Scandalum Magnatum" (libel): He was accused by the chief magistrate of the city, and the whole court of aldermen, for defaming them, as they passed along the street, on a public festival, by singing, "Room for cuckolds, here comes a great company; Room for cuckolds, here comes my lord mayor." This Parrot was a very old offender; much addicted to scurrility; and had been several times convicted of profane curs ing and swearing. He had even the impudence to abuse the whole court by calling the jury rogues and rascals; and frequently interrupted my lord judge 75</page><page sequence="14">in summing up the evidence, by crying out "old bitch." The court, however, was pleased to shew mercy to him upon the petition of his mistress, a strict Methodist, and delivered him over to Mr. Whitefield,48 who undertook to make a thorough convert of him.... 49 Once again, the parrot is the herald of adultery, but the court is obviously (the satire implies) at fault here for treating his scurrility as a libelous offense. It is the Methodist mistress (reminiscent of Ver-vert's nun keepers) who ought to be questioned; where could Poll have learnt such language? But she is not questioned; the parrot effectively shields his owner from prosecution. Similarly, when John Hill, author of the daily Inspector, places the wooden lion of Addison and Steele once more at Bedford coffeehouse to receive letters for his periodical, a correspondent named "E. F" writes him with congratulations: The Mouth of this venerable Savage I hope you will use in Imitation of a certain Countryman of ours, who bought a Parrot, and, on being greatly ridi culed for making the Purchase, at no less a price than his Bed and Curtains, gave the following Reason; That being an Englishman bom, and having the common Failing of his Country, to be open-hearted and free of Speech, a noble Virtue formerly, tho' now accounted a most unpardonable Fault, he had bought this Parrot to deliver his Sentiments, as the Malice and Envy of the present Age render'd it not safe personally to attack its Vices.50 It is their chief advantage in both these examples that parrots cannot be convicted of libel; the texts are following Prattle's precedent when they revive the theme of parrot speech, showing the endurance of the embarrass ing parrot in the authorial imaginary. In the two Parrots, the parrot figure (like the Methodist's bird) is also inseparable from women. In her Parrot 2 Prattle addresses the question of freedom of the press directly, declaring she has a particular right to the topic since "Scandal and Satyr (though we don't use them)" are the particular properties of women (2 October 1728). "Next to a Standing Army I must draw my Sword in Defence of Satyr," but the sword is merely metaphorical: "Scandal is the Woman's Weapon." Her purpose here is essentially to draw an arrow pointing between irony and the female voice: if she is daring to speak as a woman, then of course the work must be associated with satire. This point is underscored later in the essay when the author takes pains to emphasize that she (or he, I suspect) is and intends to remain anony mous. One Kitty Magpye, whose name marks her out as another of the parroting sisterhood, writes to the Parrot because she is mad to know the identity of the authoress. She first invokes the "scurrilous woman author" type, suggesting Prattle belongs to their notorious trifecta: "Mrs. H- d" or "some fair Descendent of Mrs. Behn or Mrs. Manley." She then allows 76</page><page sequence="15">that Prattle might be "a merry Wag that has thus artfully array'd your self in Female Plumes" (Parrot 2). Her final insinuation is that Prattle is really "the celebrated Polly Peachum" turned into a parrot, "for surely the Transition must be very natural.""5 The connection here to the Beggar's Opera, which counts Walpole and his administration among its many satirical targets, may point once more to the sly political stance of the text. Prattle only responds enigmatically, "I am as much Penelope Prattle, as that you are Kitty Magpye." Prattle's real reason for writing, she makes clear, is that, bursting with female opinions and without a male to rein her in, she simply cannot help but hold forth. She admits in her first essay, "I am now a Widow, the Relict of Peter Prattle, late of London, Esq; ... I thought I could not employ myself better than to write thus for the good of my Country. Modern Patriots and Parrots are the same thing in the Greek.52 To tell the whole Truth, it wants a Week of a Year and a Day since my Husband died; a Seven-days longer Silence I own would be the Decorum, but I have been a good while under a Struggle, and am now oblig'd to give vent to my Speculations." Her need to express herself, apparently, is so powerful as to overrule both sentiment for her late husband and deference to rules of social decorum. One usual trait of the caricatured widow, excessive sexual warmth, is replaced or per haps conflated here with an excessive need to speak; in either case, at issue is an appetite marked as abnormal for women. Prattle's volubility makes her unfeminine, at least according to the ideal construction of woman as devoted wife, but it also emphasizes her femaleness. Similarly to Prattle's insuperable urge to speak, Haywood's eidolon remarks that his "principle motive" for publishing is "to gratify [his] own insatiable Itch of talking."53 However, of the two political parrot composi tions, Haywood's periodical is the less conventional, and by far the less misogynistic. The voice Haywood chooses is actually not a woman's, but rather a well-traveled male parrot from Java. Interestingly, her reference to the "Authors" (a council of women) of the Female Spectator on the title page makes Poll, to the alert reader, a hermaphroditic or cross-dressed par rot, signaling that he is one who, hard to pin to any single category, can straddle boundaries and poke fun at tradition.54 Haywood's Poll, though fond of tales, also corresponds with other parrots from around the world and comments astutely on matters such as the English national character and the Jacobite rebellion. Unlike Prattle's, Haywood's use of the par rot-authoress connection is more ironic than antifeminist; her parrot is a worldly and wise "bird of parts" who is entirely capable of correcting popular faults in his own voice. In her study of gossip, Patricia Meyer Spacks recalls correctly that Haywood censures gossip as a typical woman's failing in the Female Spectator and that "she denounces her sisters with intensity comparable 77</page><page sequence="16">to that of any male moralist."55 In her Parrot, however, the periodical that Haywood developed to succeed the Female Spectator, she does not take such a simplistic view of the matter; indeed given her talent for irony and the prolixity of her literary output, her viewpoints on such "women's" topics are often hard to summarize effectively, especially among several works.56 Haywood's parrot rejects Swift's suggestion of speaking "a few words plainly," becoming instead a verbose and discursive means to dic tate to drawing rooms and coffeehouses from his swing. Haywood's cross dressed, well-traveled avian eidolon is in the end a witty and thoughtful mouthpiece for the Englishwoman he represents. Haywood turns the links to translation and exotic locale, which are weaknesses in the story Locke recounts because they undercut its value as scientific proof, to strengths in her avian mouthpiece, whom she champi ons for his narrative abilities.57 For Haywood the issue is less whether Poll can think (obviously, he can), than whether he can provoke the reader to do so. In the first issue of the periodical, Poll the parrot proudly remarks, [M]ost People who know me, will allow me to be a Bird of Parts; and, indeed, I cannot well be otherwise, considering the various Scenes of Life I have gone through,-the many different Nations I have lived among, the Conversation I have had with all Degrees of People,-the Opportunities Fortune has thrown in my way of improving myself, under the most leamed and witty Persons of their Times, and the wonderful Events that have fallen within the Compass of my Observation. (Parrot 1, p. 181) He also promises, tantalizingly, that some of his "elegant pieces" have been brought with him "from very distant Realms" (p. 186), suggesting that he will regale the reader with oriental tales. Poll is a particularly qualified speaker precisely because of his well-traveled exoticism, is worth listen ing to not because he is discreet but because he is not, and has matters of interest and importance, gleaned from others, to relate. He represents the usefulness of prattle to the periodical author, and the allure of prattle to the periodical reader. At the same time, he forces the reader to admit the potential value of gossip and repetition-the qualities likened disparag ingly to women's language through examples like Prattle's. The cosmopolitan Poll gives us a "brief Recital" of his travels, remark ing that he was born in Java, and, taken young from his parents, from there traveled variously to Batavia, Versailles, Flanders, Brussels, Antwerp, Holland, Calais, Madrid, Italy, and, of course, England.58 Poll has been owned by so many different families that he defensively remarks, "You will wonder, and with reason, that being in such high Estimation as I pretend to have been, I was so readily and so often parted with by those who had me in Possession" (p. 183). In the next issue, the parrot anticipates and attacks xenophobic racism like Hume's when he decries the discrimina 78</page><page sequence="17">tion against color (in his case, green) that he has encountered among his readers: "The Colour I brought into the World with me, and shall never change, it seems, is an Exception against me;-some People will have it that a Negro might as well set up for a Beauty, as a green Parrot for a good Speaker;-Preposterous Assertion!" (Parrot 2, p. 197). Nussbaum remarks of this moment, "In Haywood's rendering . . . the parrot becomes a sub versive (though somewhat camouflaged) agent of both antiracism and antislavery in an account that satirizes facile connections drawn between color and ability" (p. 137). At the same time, this is clearly a fictional ized and tongue-in-cheek account of racism, as indeed are many of Poll's complaints against his readers, highlighting his status as a fantastic con struct and reminding us of the author who created him. Camell reads this same moment as pro-Jacobite (the color green was associated with the oak emblem of the Stuarts), which suggests Haywood's point is in part that politics are the purview of the socially marginalized, whether women authors, Jacobites, or pets.59 Haywood sacrifices a degree of seriousness in return for the flexibility and multivalent qualities of satire. Another part of the drollness of her parrot is that he is cross-dressed. Haywood ties Poll's authorship unequivocally to the authorial entity behind the Female Spectator, whose run had ended only months before the Parrot appeared, and which was a clear success with the readers: the Parrot's title page reads, "By the Authors of The Female Spectator." We are meant, I suspect, always to remember and hear the Englishwoman behind the parrot. The gender-defying link between the ladies of the Female Spectator and the male parrot editor is implicitly acknowledged in the seventh entry, wherein Poll notes, "I have always considered Woman as the last, and most finished Work of the omnipotent and all-wise Creator" (Parrot 7, p. 269) and goes on to a lengthy discourse on the habits and characters of women of various ethnicities around the world. In contrast to the Swiftian par rot comparison that belittles women's speech, Poll insists that all women are interesting and worthy. Although her tone as the Parrot is satirical, Haywood's facetiousness is not overriding: in the end, she does seem proud of her venture into parroting authorship. The issue of gossip because it is a "feminine" mode of discourse is particularly germane to this point. Although a great linguist, Haywood's parrot, like all of his brethren, is an incurable tattle-tale, and later issues of the periodical contain examples of parrots and their inconsiderate pro pensity to reveal damaging truths, following in the august tradition of the Captain Thumper parrot and his ballad-singing brother of the Connoisseur. Haywood's Poll confesses that he unfortunately "never was blessed with the retentive faculty;-[he] was sure to report whatever [he] heard, and not seldom to those in whose Presence [he] ought to have been more cautious; so that [he] was soon looked upon as a dangerous Bird," who occasioned 79</page><page sequence="18">"very great Disappointments, Dissensions, and Mischiefs of various Kinds" by his "blabbing" (Parrot 1, pp. 183-84). Parrots, in short, are hazardous to the members of society chary of their reputations, although of course the fault lies more with the human keepers who provide them with material than with the birds themselves. In most examples of parrots embarrassing their keepers through infe licitous repetition, the scandal revealed is some sort of sexual misconduct. Haywood, though skilled in composing amatory fiction, is careful to keep her terms general here. Her design is to create a Jacobite parrot, one of whose secrets is the unreasonableness of the English prejudice against the Stuart line, and another of which is his readers' foolish resistance to femi nine authorial value. Haywood seems particularly to resist the "Wiles of Women"-style parrot tale in her final number, Parrot 9. One of Poll's parrot correspondents, Amicus Veritas, relates the story of a lapidary's kleptoma niacal parrot who compulsively steals and squirrels away diamonds until the jeweler, enraged, has an innocent maid servant hanged (Parrot 9, pp. 305 07).6o This short tale has all the characters from the husband and par rot tradition, but its outcome is reversed: the woman is innocent, the man a tyrant. The moral of the story, we are told, is not that women are over sexed, but that it is dangerous to be "too certain of any thing": readers need to be more skeptical, and parrots (especially, Poll makes clear, the human variety), while not malicious, are dangerous if misunderstood (p. 307). Even so, Haywood seems to want to recuperate some elements of this sort of reporting, and she suggests that the simple act of parroting is actually something important in and of itself. Rather grandiosely, Poll declares, Mark me then, and suppose me not a mere Parrot, which without Distinction utters all he hears, and is the Eccho of every foolish Rumour; but a Thing,-a Thing to which I cannot give a Name, but I mean a Thing sent by the Gods, and by them inspired to utter only sacred Truths.-I must not say an Oracle, because it would savour too much of Paganism.-Imagine me somewhat extraordinary. (Parrot 1, p. 185) In his paraliptic insistence on his exceptional existence as an oracular or sibylline thing, an ineffable, yet prophetically speaking thing, the parrot conflates the positions of subject and object, speaker and listener, writer and reader.6" Yet he also undermines this lofty position; the silliness of this extraordinary bird's being able to read and write is always acknowledged. Poll's connection to the oracular in some respects parallels the over translation of Locke's parrot anecdote: the ancient oracles were women, but male priests were required to act as intermediaries and translate their gibberish to the supplicants. Haywood therefore mimics this need for the mediation of women's speech when she collapses priest and oracle into her transgendered mouthpiece-and makes him a semimagical house pet.62 80</page><page sequence="19">Although it is never explained how Haywood's parrot manages the authorial feat himself, the sixth entry begins with the remark from Poll, "A Parrot of my Acquaintance has got somebody (for I am sure he never learned to write himself) to send me a whimsical sort of Letter" (Parrot 6, p. 155). Because of the commonplace comparison between women's speech and that of parrots, this hypocritical parenthetical seems to point to a joke, again referring to the notion of a "few words spoken plainly" about the ability of women to write, and write wittily. As the parrot him self notes, critics might "cavil at my Stile, my Manner, perhaps hunt out a verb misplaced ... and cry shame on my ill Rhetoric. But let them look to themselves;-every Thing, when attacked, has a Right to make use of what Weapons of Defence are in their Power: If they rail against the Diction of the Parrot, the Parrot will cry out against the Vices and Follies of Humanity" (Parrot 1, p. 187). The complaints here are obviously those of a woman author tired of being dismissed as the parrot she sarcastically, perhaps for the sake of argument, pretends to be. Surely when Poll rants about the impossibility of pleasing his readers, he is openly reflecting his creator's struggles to entice an unpredictable reading public. The chief purpose of most essay periodicalists is to shape and reform public manners and morals, a task that, due to its emphasis on bourgeois modes and mores, requires women as much as men to become obedient readers; a task to which, if Haywood's parrot is to be believed, the public is unreasonably resistant. "[I]f any one should go about to shew them the Injustice of their Opinion," harrumphs the parrot, "either way, till they are pleased to change it of themselves, would run a greater Hazard by that Contradiction, than by depreciating the God that made them" (Parrot 2, p. 198). At one point, Poll answers the question of how to get into the favor of an English person, "Alas! I wish I knew it myself:-I have long laboured for this useful Part of Learning, but find Algebra, the Arabic, Syrian, or Chaldean Languages, much more easily obtained:-All these, by dint of Labour and a constant Application, you may, in Time, be tolerable Masters of; but to please the English ... is an Art which no Mortal could ever yet be possessed of' (Parrot 6, p. 258). The parrot insinuates that the learning of the ancient orient, to which, as native of Java, he has ancestral ties and on which he can thus speak with authority, is far more accessible and reasonable than his modern readers' characters. Thus Haywood's Parrot ultimately attempts to recuperate a number of overlapping sub jects-women writers, Jacobites, foreign elements, gossip speakers-for the didactic project of her periodical63 by displacing objections off of her markedly absurd narrator onto a faulty and finicky reading public.64 When, nearly two decades earlier, Penelope Prattle owns that though she knows the number of periodicals available is grown "cumbersome," in the end, "I must speak and Write when the Humour takes me ... for the 81</page><page sequence="20">Sake of telling it," this periodical's author invites the reader to laugh at the knowingly careless speech of parroting women. The contest over whether a parrot speaker produces a valuable discourse, or merely re-produces the words and ideas of others, is thus implicitly linked to the promiscuous periodical culture in which Haywood's Parrot participates. Haywood's later work challenges the right of this reading public to think itself better than a parrot; her use of the parrot is thus an aggressive technique, reclaiming rhetorical femininity for her texts. The often male-authored links between pet parrots and sexual narratives would suggest that women are meant rather to reproduce than produce; Haywood's parrot, linked to her Female Spectator's women authors, would imply otherwise. When Prattle remarks in passing that, "[t]ho' Women divert themselves in a little Tea-table tattle, yet without great Provocation, nothing scurrilous or indecent is ever to be heard among the better sort of my Sex" (Parrot 2), she is being facetious, but her surface implication, that men are quite capable of both generating and listening to libel and tattle, is perfectly true. Haywood champions a circumstance that Prattle also understands, but chooses to mock: that almost from their inception, periodicals relied upon not only women readers, but also the attractiveness of "women's" speech to readers of both sexes.65 "Fair sexing" was hardly limited to Addison and Steele, and, as the Tatler's enormous popularity and endurance demonstrate, the alliance to tattling sorts of speech could actually bring great credit to a work. Other periodicals (many even later than the second Parrot) like the Prater (by "Nicholas Babble," 13 March-6 November 1756),66 Frances Brooke's Old Maid (15 November 1755-24 July 1756), or the Babler (Hugh Kelly, 12 February 1763-65-June 1767) follow Steele's lead in attempting to attract an audience with a title or mouthpiece that promises feminized speech. Many of them, some quite successful-for example, Christopher Smart's Midwife (October 1750-April 1753)-are penned by men cheer fully and transparently masquerading as women. If women speak just as parrots do, Haywood suggests, then the entire periodical genre can be encapsulated within a Parrot. "Many fine Things have been said," the Parrot assures his readers, "Things which have had the greatest Influence over you, by those who have been as much Parrots as myself," whether or not they admit it (Parrot 3, p. 215).

Baldwin, 1709-10), no. 3, 11-13 July 1709. Printed in 1709 and 1710 by Benjamin Bragge and later Abigail Baldwin, the text has a complex publishing history but was none theless an unusually successful member of the tribe of Tatler imitators. See Tedra S. Osell's "Tatling Women in the Public Sphere: Rhetorical Femininity and the English Essay Periodical," Eighteenth-Century Studies, 38, No. 2 (2005), 283-300, for a better acquaintance with this work, or Robert B. White's dissertation, A Study of The Female Tatler, University of North Carolina, 1966. Subsequent references to Osell will be cited parenthetically in the text. 2 The fictional-sounding "Captain Thumper" is an alias of Crab's in Thomas D'Urfey's bawdy comedy The Bath (1701). One thinks here of the episode in Giacomo Casanova's memoirs, History of My Life, trans. Willard R. Trask (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997), p. 340, wherein to exact revenge against La Charpillon for spurning him, he trains a parrot to say "Miss Charpillon is more of a whore than her mother" and places it in the Royal Exchange; unable to sue a parrot for libel, the women are forced to put up with it until someone buys the bird. 3 The British Apollo (originally published February 1708-May 1711 by J. Mayo in London) ascribed The Female Tatler's original authorship to the playwright Thomas Baker (in no. 49, 14 September 1709), and although there has been some debate, Baker continues to be the most probable candidate for authorship. See Walter Graham, "Thomas Baker, Mrs. Manley, and the Female Tatler," Modern Philology, 34, No. 3 (1937), 267-72; John Harrington Smith, "Thomas Baker and The Female Tatler," Modern Philobgy, 49, No. 3 (1952), 182-88; White's A Study of The Female Tatler; and M. M. Goldsmith's Introduction to By a Society of Ladies: Essays in The Female Tatler (Sterling, VA: Thoemmes Press, 1999), pp. 43-44 for the case in favor of Baker. For the case in favor of Delarivier Manley, see Paul Bunyan Anderson, "The History and Authorship of Mrs. Crackenthorpe's Female Tatler," Modern Philology, 28, No. 3 (1931), 354-60; Bertha Monica Steams, "Early English Periodicals for Ladies," PMLA, 48, No. 1 (1933), 38-60; Leona Rostenberg, Literary, Political, Scientific, Religious and Legal Publishing, Printing and Bookselling in England, 1551-1700: Twelve Studies (New York: Burt Franklin, 1965), pp. 409-12; Margaret Hunt, "Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment," Women and the Enlightenment (New York: Haworth Press, 1984), pp. 41-68; and Fidelis Morgan, ed. and introd., The Female Tatler, by [Phoebe Crackenthorpe], Everyman ed.

I am inclined to agree, but the point cannot be verified. 5 For recent work on gender and the periodical milieu, see Kathryn Shevelow, 83</page><page sequence="22">Women and Print Culture: The Construction of Femininity in the Early Periodical (London: Routledge, 1989); Ros Ballaster et al., Women's Worlds: Ideology, Femininity, and the Woman's Magazine (London: MacMillan, 1991); Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace, "Tea, Gender, and Domesticity in Eighteenth-Century England," in Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture, 23, ed.

John Hill raised the ire of a number of other authors in his periodical The Inspector; such vitriolic responses as the one here, often attributed to John Kennedy, were common. 7 Formatted as a weekly essay followed by a news compendium that was framed (not unusually) as a letter to a friend in the country, The Parrot, with a Compendium of the Times ran for nine issues, 2 August to 4 October 1746.

See as well Christine Blouch's introduction to the Parrot in The Selected Works of Eliza Haywood, ed.

Subsequent references to Nussbaum will be cited parenthetically in the text. 81 find extremely helpful much of Osell's work on "rhetorical femininity"?that is, the deliberate assumption of a female voice regardless of the author's sex?in the periodicals, though I regard with some caution the contention that, "[u]nlike narrative transvestism, rhetorical femininity depends on and exploits, rather than transgresses, gender binaries" (p. 298, n. 13). In my readings at any rate, several cases of periodical rhetorical femininity (Christopher Smart's Midwife or Bonnell Thornton's Roxana Termagant in the Drury Lane Journal, for example) do indeed take pleasure in the transgression of gender boundaries their authors employ, and the British Apollo actually attacked the Female Tatler for Baker's rhetorical cross dressing. 9 Carnell, "The Very Scandal of Her Tea Table: Eliza Haywood's Response to the Whig Public Sphere," in Presenting Gender, ed. Chris Mounsey (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 2001), p. 255. In Haywood's own words, "Nothing more plainly shews a weak and degenerate Mind, than taking a Delight in whispering 84</page><page sequence="23">about every idle Story we are told, to the Prejudice of our Neighbours: This is a Fault charged more generally on our Sex than the other; and, I am sorry to say, with but too much Justice"; qtd. in The Female Spectator, Selected Works of Eliza Haywood, ed. Kathryn R. King and Pettit, ser. 2, vols. 2-3 (London: Pickering and Chatto, 2001), no. 13, 2 May 1745, p. 5. 10 Four numbers exist (9 September and 2, 9, and 16 October 1728). Authorship is sometimes attributed to Haywood, but erroneously so. In his recent assessment of Haywood's work, A Bibliography of Eliza Haywood (London: Pickering and Chatto, 2004), Patrick Spedding convincingly discredits Alison Adburghams's Women in Print: Writing Women and Women's Magazines From the Restoration to the Accession of Victoria (London: George Allen and Unwin, Ltd., 1972) and its misattribution of the 1728 Parrot (an error which he tracks back to 1930). I have been unable to discover the true author, but (s)he is likely to have been male, and perhaps more to the point, to have been taken for male by the text's readers. At this point in the history of periodical literature, male authors writing as women were far more common than female ones. 11 Psittacorum Regio: The Land of the Parrots: Or, the She-Lands (London: F. Kirkman, 1668). In this version of the narrative, the principal, wandering some where around New Guinea, is captured by some marauding Amazon-like women called She-landresses and taken to their capital, Gosspingoa. He is forced to swear, at a statue of Juno, to follow their laws: never to injure women by word or deed, never to interrupt a woman, to allow his wife to govern the house, to avoid enemy states, to be monogamous, never to tell his wife's secrets, never to deny her any accessories, and "continually give women the-[Prick, in Hall] and the Praise for Beauty, Wit and Eloquence, and defend them against all men" (p. 62).

My thanks to Dwight Douglas Codr for suggesting the text. 13 See Bruce Thomas Boehrer, Parrot Culture: Our 2,500-Year-Long Fascination with the World's Most Talkative Bird (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), pp. 16-18, for a satiric reading of the poem's view on parrots. Subsequent references will be cited parenthetically in the text. More generally, Boehrer argues that the Romans associated parrots with the inferior aspects of humanity; in Renaissance and Enlightenment Europe, they become equally useful for attacking those whose race, class, or gender positions them on a lower social strata (pp. 50, 65). 14 Discovered in the 1560s at the court of the Indian Emperor Akbar; see Muhammed A. Simsar, "Introduction," The Cleveland Museum of Art's Tuti Nama: Tales of a Parrot (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1978), p. xiii. Subsequent references will be cited parenthetically in the text. 15 Nine of Nakhshabi's fifty-two stories (3, 5, 9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 23, 30) are based on the originally Sanskrit Shukasaptati ("Seventy Tales of a Parrot"); others come from the Panchatantra, Sindbad-nama (which appears as night 8 in the Tuti-nama), and Kalila wa Dimna (Simsar, p. xix). Akbar, a patron of the arts, was apparently 85</page><page sequence="24">quite taken with Tuti-nama; he had an abridged version published, and it made the tales popular in the region. Later Muhammad Qudiri also created a condensed and simplified version, which was translated into English by Francis Gladwin in 1801 (Simsar, p. xxiii). In 1792 in London, Minerva Press published tales 1, 6, 7, 9, 14, 16, 35, 39, 40, 41, 45, and 46 by means of B. Garrans' translation into English. See also Stephen Belcher's "Parallel Tracks?

See also p. 142. 20 The first parrots in Britain appeared forty million years ago, vastly predating human civilization, and modern parrots (Psittaciformes) were introduced to classical Europe from India by Alexander the Great, though African and South American parrots would follow during the period of colonial exploration in the sixteenth century (Boehrer, pp. ix, 1-2). Thus, in Boehrer's words, "the story of parrots in the west is connected, from its very beginning, with Europe's conquest and absorption of other territories" (pp. 1-2). 21 According to Louise Robbins, in Elephant Slaves and Pampered Parrots: Exotic Animals in Eighteenth-Century Paris (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), pp. 125-26, "The higher prices commanded for parrots derived not just from [their ability to speak], but from their continued rarity and exotic origin. Despite a few successful attempts, parrots were not bred in Europe in significant numbers until the nineteenth century; thus each bird had been born overseas and imported, from Africa, South America, or some other distant place." 22 Recall (as Laura Brown does) Pope's cry by means of the Baron in The Rape of the Lock: "let Earth, Air, Sea to Chaos fall, / Men, Monkeys, Lap-Dogs, Parrots, perish all!"; qtd. in Brown's chapter "The Orangutang, the Lapdog, and the Parrot: 86</page><page sequence="25">The Fable of the Nonhuman Being," Fables of Modernity: Literature and Culture in the English Eighteenth Century (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), pp. 221-66.

Braunschneider argues that even the mun dane lapdog took on a veneer of not just the erotic, but also the exotic, because it was so often included in lists with parrots, monkeys, and (jarringly) china (p. 40). 241 am indebted throughout this section to Brown's chapter 6, "The Fable of the Nonhuman Being," pp. 221-66. 25 Brown explains, "this familiar group of animals occupies a complex position in relation to 'Men.' Together, this cohort of beings is the center of an anxious, heated, even virulent debate on the topic of alterity, a debate in which the idea of 'Men' is systematically problematized by its juxtaposition with a different category of being, and through which, consequently, one dimension of the European encounter with the non-European is imaginatively absorbed and debated" (p. 223). 26 Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: A History of Modern Sensibility (New York: Pantheon Books, 1983), pp. 110-20. 27 George Colman (the Elder) and Bonnell Thornton, The Connoisseur.

In her Adventures of Eovaai, Princess of Ijaveo, ed. Earla Wilputte (1736; rpt., Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 1999), Haywood inverts this story in the tale of Atamadoul, who is punished for desiring the evil Ochihatou (Haywood's satirical Walpole charac ter) by being changed into a monkey and chained to his bed, where she is forced to watch him grant to other women the favors she can no longer enjoy, while at the same time fending off an amorous baboon. 31 Jean Baptiste Louis Gresset, "Ver-Vert: or, the Nunnery Parrot: An Heroic Poem in Four Cantos" (London: R. and J.

On pp. 267-69 he contextualizes this parrot incident within a broader discussion on the discourse of sympathy and human identity. For an extended reading of this moment, which emphasizes the distance shown between space, species, languages, and cultures here, see Brown, pp. 245-49. See also Boehrer, pp. 70-71; he points out that Locke may be reacting against the medieval beast lore that commonly featured intelligent rational animals, parrots among them. 39 Although the story is meant to allow for the possibility of the parrot's intel ligence, it does not at all shake Locke from his supposition that "whoever should hear a Cat or a Parrot discourse, reason, and philosophize, would call or think it nothing but a Cat or a Parrotn even if it is admittedly a "very intelligent rational Parrot" (book 2, chapter 27, p. 332).

The journal seems to have a murky publication history; the English Short Title Catalogue (s.v. "British Journal" http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-list [accessed 13 May 2008]) notes that some dates are given according to Lady Day. Authorship is sometimes attributed to John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, though they may have been attached to its earlier (1722-) incarnation, as Trenchard died in 1723. 45 The Jacobite Nathaniel Mist had one largely sustained journalistic effort in three different incarnations: he used his position as editor of the Weekly Journal (December 1716-April 1725) to alter it into the aggressive Mist's Weekly Journal 88</page><page sequence="27">(May 1725-September 1728), and then, after a very brief interruption due to the author's political woes, it became Fog's Weekly Journal (September 1728-October 1737; Mist retained ownership if not active editorship, which went to Charles Molloy). The epitaph writer's triumph must have been sadly short-lived. The end of the epitaph, "But all are Mists in Perkin's Crew, / And prove but Vapours, Fog, and Dew" is either prescient, or it is a wry acknowledgement of Mist's rebirth. 46 In Martin Battestin's words, in "Four New Fielding Attributions: His Earliest Satires of Walpole," Studies in Bibliography, 36 (1983), 80-81, On Saturday, 20 July 1728, The Craftsman published a rousing little ballad contributed by an anonymous correspondent who, having just returned to town from a visit to Houghton, Sir Robert Walpole's country house in Norfolk, was moved to commemo rate in song one of the most conspicuous of the many sumptuous furnishings with which the minister had adorned his "great Palace." The object that he so particularly admired was a large copper-gilt lantern for eighteen candles which hung in the hall. "The Norfolk Lanthorn," as the poet called it, seemed a fit emblem for the minister's peculiar way of letting his light shine before men, as it were?declaring in its huge ness and opulence both the poverty of his taste and the riches he was amassing at the expense of his country. . . . Angry replies appeared at once in the ministerial press. The Parrot states simply, "Some People dislike your great large Lanthorn, but I approve of it... If one's ways be dark and slippery, there is more need he should be well illuminated." 47 While the Walpole regime's efforts at controlling the press would later grow much more daunting, already Nathaniel Mist, as Prattle was clearly aware, had been forced to live in exile in France to escape government persecution and had had his press broken. Likewise, Amhurst's Craftsman (5 December 1726-ca. 1737), ceaseless in its dislike of the ministry, was under threat of prosecution; the Craftsman survived remarkably well but Prattle could not have known the outcome in 1728. 48 George Whitefield, the controversial Calvinist evangelist preacher, who was involved in founding the Methodist movement, was (unlike the Connoisseur) firmly against the theater and public amusements, while the parrot's singing the popular ballad "Room for Cuckolds" marks him as allied to the opposite extreme, given up to the pleasures of noise. 49 Connoisseur 12, 18 April 1754. 50 John Hill, The Inspector. London Daily Advertiser (London: R. Griffiths, 1751 53), No. 223, 18 November 1751. 51 Polly is the heroine of Gay's sensation, the Beggar's Opera, which had opened earlier that same year. Her name intentionally invokes the Poll-parrot connection for all the usual reasons: "when Macheath greets Polly as a parrot, 'O pretty, pretty Poll!' (1.13.124), he is fairly secure in his opinion of women"; see Jonathan Lamb, "The Crying of Lost Things," English Literary History, 71, No. 4 (2004), 963. 52 This expression seems uncommon (there is no record of it in Morris Palmer Tilley's Dictionary of the Proverbs in England or the Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs). There is a similar expression in D'Urfey's The Marriage-Hater Match'd (London: Richard Bentley, 1692): "'tis all one to me, 'tis the same thing in the Greek" (II.5). 53 Haywood, The Parrot (1746), The Selected Works of Eliza Haywood, ed. Blouch, 89</page><page sequence="28">Pettit, and Hanson, ser. 2, vol. 1 (London: Pickering and Chatto, 2000-01), p. 186. Subsequent references will be cited parenthetically in the text. 54 Carnell first pointed out the androgynous position of Haywood's parrot in "It's Not Easy Being Green," p. 205. 55 Patricia Meyer Spacks, Gossip (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), p. 40. 56 Paula Backschneider, using Umberto Eco's category, comments of her novels that Haywood can be read as "a pioneer creator of the deliberately ambiguous"; see "The Story of Eliza Haywood's Novels," The Passionate Fictions of Eliza Haywood: Essays on Her Life and Work, ed. Kirsten T. Saxton and Rebecca P. Bocchicchio (Kentucky: University of Kentucky Press, 2000), p. 23. 57 A rash of recent scholarship suggests that Haywood's work is frequently in conversation with Lockean thought. See for example Kelly McGuire, "Mourning and Material Culture in Eliza Haywood's The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless," Eighteenth-Century Fiction, 18, No. 3 (2006), 281-304; Jonathan Brody Kramnick, "Locke, Haywood, and Consent," English Literary History, 72, No. 2 (2005), 453-70; and Helen Thompson, '"In Idea, a Thousand Nameless Joys': Secondary Qualities in Arnauld, Locke, and Haywood's Lasselia, The Eighteenth Century: Theory and Interpretation," 48, No. 3 (2007), 225-43. 58 Haywood's parrot is invoking the circulating object when he recounts his history. Eighteenth-century prose saw a surprising range of things generally inar ticulate holding forth on the page, from coins (Gildon's 1709 The Golden Spy) to dogs (Coventry's 1751 Pompey the Little); parrots and women, as creatures capable of sound, but not, to some minds, deserving of authority, can thus resonate unpleas antly with this category. 59 Carnell, "It's Not Easy Being Green," p. 207; "The Very Scandal of Her Tea Table," pp. 264-65. Carnell, building in part on the work of Jill Campbell, has clearly demonstrated that Haywood's (proto-)feminism is linked to her Jacobitism in this work, just as Campbell, in Natural Masques: Gender and Identity in Fielding's Plays and Novels (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995), has shown that Jacobitism was clearly linked in the minds of the anti-Jacobites to a particular sort of outspoken and dominant (and thus unnatural) female. 60 I agree with Carnell's suggestion that Haywood may well have had access to Galland's or another version of the "Husband and the Parrot" ("It's Not Easy Being Green," p. 211, n. 26); I also suspect the story recalls (and resonates humorously with) Aesop's fable of the cock who finds diamonds in a dunghill and rejects them as less useful to him than barley. Parrots are more extravagant creatures. 61 Interestingly, in her Female Spectator 13, a book largely devoted to the topic of gossip, Haywood also refers to "Reputation" as a "Thing" that "speaks for itself," "the most serious Thing in Life," and "A Thing, in which consists the greatest Happiness or misery of the Person concern'd" (p. 11). The revisiting of the speak ing "Thing" here might suggest a return to and revision of her earlier treatment on the theme of gossiping. 62 My thanks to Nicole Horejsi for pointing out to me the gendered dynamic of the oracular. 63 Which is, as she puts it, "To rectify several Errors ... in your Mode of Dress and behavior to each other, or in the higher concerns of Religion and Morality" 90</page><page sequence="29">(Parrot I, p. 186). 64 A remark on that public's apparent rejection of this work seems in order. It is true that the print run of Haywood's Parrot encloses only nine weekly numbers (2 August to 4 October 1746), thus suggesting that, compared to the Female Spectator, the work was a dismal disappointment. However, Spedding hypothesizes that rather than ending because of unpopularity, the periodical may have been discontinued because of Haywood's increasing health problems: "It seems unlikely that sales of [The Parrot] were not high enough for the publishers to continue with it, since it was considered worth reprinting in Dublin" (p. 492). The journal's short life may thus not necessarily be proof of its absolute failure, or of the inappropriateness of its literary choices. Certainly its demise marked no end to the popularity of parrots and women as periodical subjects. 65 Osell observes, "[B]oth women and periodicals played a role in defining (and therefore limiting) acceptable subjects and forms of public discourse. Women and essay periodicals fulfill the same theoretical roles; they are conceptually similar in kind" (p. 288). 66 Printed for T Lownds, 1757.
