<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEANING OF MODERN BUSINESS. By Richard Eells.'L New York: Columbia University Press. I960. PP. Xi, 427. $7.50. When asked to define the term "business corporation," lawyers tend to frame a reply along the following lines: The business corporation is a legal device to permit individuals to pool their resources for the con- duct of business transactions within a particular but variable frame- work of joint control and with special legal consequences of which per- haps the most important is limited liability. This is true enough as far as it goes; it demonstrates the legal custom of limiting a definition to the minimum necessary to explain a given concept. But lawyers and non-lawyers alike recognize that more is needed to explain the business corporation, especially the large business corporation, as an institution in our capitalist society. Indeed, the explanation cannot be framed in terms of a definition at all. As Richard Eells points out, "the modern corporation is an institution in search of a philosophy." (p. I7) This Review has often contributed to that task, most notably in the Dodd- Berle exchange of views some twenty-eight years ago.2 ' Consultant for the General Electric Co. and Adjunct Professor of Business, Columbia University. 2 Dodd, For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?, 45 HARV.

The elder scholar continues to batter away at our stereotyped dogma concerning the form and nature of corporate wealth; 5 the younger suggests that the time has come for thinkers and businessmen alike to concentrate on developing a rationale for the corporation as one of the major power centers in a free and pluralistic polity. Other authority-wielding institutions, such as the church, the state, and the army, have the advantage of an established rationale, developed over centuries, for the governance of their internal and ex- ternal relationships. The business corporation, a parvenu in such distinguished company, lacks a fully developed scheme of being. Concentrating first on what is rather than what ought to be, Eells points out that both in theory and in practice the contemporary scene exhibits two conflicting models of large-scale corporate enterprise. One of these he calls "the traditional corporation." Maximizing profit for the stockholders is the sole goal toward which it -sometimes blindly, sometimes wisely -plunges. The fixing of policy and the making of decisions becomes primarily a question of deciding between long-range and short-range advantage for the "owners." Based on igth century Social Darwinism, this model persists more in theory than in practice. The fact that it is looked upon as ideal by a significant number of businessmen, however, means that decision-making in some corpora- tions is bound, to a degree, to reflect the "traditional corporation" view- point. Its spokesmen, not to say apologists, may also be found among philosophers ,6 novelists,7 and even book-reviewers.8 At the other end of the scale is the model which Eells terms "the metrocorporation." This is the model currently associated with the names of "corporate statesmen" such as Abrams and Olds. It is socially responsible, even philanthropic; in short, a "good corporate citizen." Its primary goal is still profit-maximization; but its managers recognize that as an institution it has functions, coordinate with those of other power centers, in the governance of its internal microcosmic society and in the adjustment of its external relations. Its directors and executives tend to think of themselves not as employees of the stockholders but as wielders of power, who must balance the claims of all who furnish capital to the enterprise, either in the form of debt or equity, along with the claims of labor, suppliers, consumers, and even more indirect claim- (I932); Berle, For Whom Corporate Managers Are Trustees: A Note, 45 HARV.

If the internal government is fully developed, strong and cen- tralized, the metrocorporate system tends to produce "organization men" and, indeed, may even take on an anthropomorphic character, such as is reflected by the jocular name Dupont's employees apply to the company -"Uncle Dupie." While the metrocorporate model may be more useful than the tradi- tional model in explaining large-scale corporate enterprise today, it is not necessarily the best model for developing a tenable corporate phi- losophy. In the normative portion of his book Eells states the case for a model which he calls "the well tempered corporation." Like a stringed musical instrument, though no one voice speaks perfectly, all its voices must be in harmony. Further, it must not only be in tune, it must stay in tune. In terms of the corporation this means that the primary, profit-making goal must be pursued with an eye on other responsibili- ties, stemming from the corporation's institutional status in our power structure. It also means that managers must consciously and continu- ously prevent the institution from overreaching with respect to its claims on the individuals who serve it and with respect to the power which is allocated to it in a polity philosophically based on power fragmentation. One of the most thought-provoking sections of the Eells book, from the standpoint of a lawyer, is that dealing with corporate governance. In the adjustment of claims of persons within the corporate ambiance - capital suppliers, labor, and management is it enough to rely on a board of directors and an annual shareholders' meeting as the only machinery of government? What of tyranny by the majority over the minority? Is this really prevented by the introduction of the scheme of control known as cumulative voting? Is judicial intervention, with its attendant costs and publicity, the only feasible way for a minority shareholder to test the loyalty of the directors with respect to a par- ticular corporate decision? 9 And how can the laborer or the junior in management be protected against the whim or the neurosis of his superior? Is the "chain of command" process the best method for the making of routine decisions? To these questions Eells' book furnishes no answers. The function of the writer who attempts to break new ground, however, is not to answer all questions but to point the way for others to follow, to add, to enrich, and to develop. Lawyers are peculiarly equipped to make a contribution in this area. In a singularly obtuse review of the Eells book, one reviewer has characterized the well-tempered corporation as "nothing but Riesman's 'other-directed' personality writ large." 10 A more careful attention to the text would show quite the opposite to be correct. Eells does say that public relations, as one of the instruments of corporate policy, can be more effective if communication is regarded as a two-way street. He realizes, however, that neither a rationale for large-scale corporate enterprise nor a reliable guide to action can be achieved solely by the ' Cf.

This book calls on all who live and profit by private corporate enter- prise (and that includes most of us) to think deeply, and indeed greatly, about its rationale, its goals, and its methodology. To this task prac- tical businessmen as well as theoreticians must make a contribution. The General Electric Company deserves acclaim first for finding Mr. Eells, but more significantly for setting him free to furnish leadership in this important field. Dean Courtney Brown, likewise, must be com- plimented for encouraging the Eells project, of which this book is first fruit, and which continues under the auspices of the Columbia Business School. If further products match the quality of this endeavor, an important contribution to American thought is underway.
