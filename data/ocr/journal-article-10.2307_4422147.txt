Lister has presented a large and important ethno- graphical collection from the Pacific in memory of her father, Mr J. A. Lister. The collection includes specimens, some of which date back to I860, from the Solomons, Admiralty Islands, New Hebrides, Niu6 or Savage Island, and various islands in Micronesia; but the most interesting are a wooden fisherman's chest or tuluma from the Tokelau or Union Islands, and a coco-nut vessel from the Solomon Islands, inlaid with pearl shell (Pls. XXVII-XXVIII). The chest is of circular shape at the base with the sides tapering inwards towards the oval top. It is carved from 'kanava' wood, which is very resistant to water, with the grain running up and down.

Outside are lugs through which a plaited fibre string is passed to keep the lid in place. In this respect the Lister tuluma is typical, but in the centre of the base a medallion in low relief depicting men dancing and feasting has been carved. Around the perimeter of the base of the box, and projecting not more than one- tenth of an inch, are eight square studs spaced equally. Alternating with the square studs and equally spaced are cross-shaped protuber- ances. The central medallion is reminiscent of the anthropomorphic carving on Tongan clubs, while the square and cruciform projec- tions would appear to have been copied from the iron studs on a European seaman's chest. The coco-nut vessel from the Solomon Islands is an ordinary coco- nut shell perforated through one of the eyes, and two holes have been made opposite each other in the middle of the nut. This has been polished and ornamented with pearl-shell inlay. The two un- pierced eyes at the top have been so adorned. Formerly the holes in the belly of the nut were also both adorned with a ring of pearl shell, one of which still remains in position. Three double bands of small triangular shell fragments are set in canarium nut gum round the sides of the vessel, and a very fine representation of the customary frigate bird is inlaid between two of the rows of triangular shell. The style is characteristic of the small island of Ulawa. The frigate bird, 'Daula', is perhaps the commonest art motive of the Islands, occurring as it does on lime boxes, fishing-floats, canoes, and even being used as a design scarred on the body in lieu of tattoo- ing. In fact an incised frigate bird is regarded as a sine qua non for existence after death. Known as 'Kaula', the frigate bird is sacred at Ulawa, where it is regarded as a sort of guardian spirit of sailors. It is looked on as a tindalo or ancestral spirit by natives of Florida. Fishermen of this island when they see the bird at sea will pray as follows: 'Do thou draw the canoe that it may reach the land; speed my canoe, grandfather, that it may reach the shore whither I am bound.' H 49</page><page sequence="5">This brief description of the significance of the frigate bird may be of assistance in determining the use of the vessel. As a water-carrier it is obviously rendered useless by the two lateral holes. It is pos- sible that the vessel may be a primitive substitute for a sextant. Rear-Admiral Hugh Rodman, U.S.N. (Retd.)' describes a method of navigation which he believes to have been used on voyages be- tween Hawaii and Tahiti. A calabash three feet long was used, near the top of which four holes had been bored. Water was filled up to the holes, thus ensuring an artificial horizon. By taking a sight through one of the holes and over the rim of the calabash a definite angle was made with the horizon (in the example described, about I90). When the canoe reached a point where the North star was just visible on the rim of the calabash when seen through one of the holes in the side, the navigators knew they were in the same latitude as Hawaii, and turned east or west accordingly. Admiral Rodman's article is, however, criticized by J. F. G. Stokesz of the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, who identifies the specimen described as being really a 'travelling trunk'. In default of confirmatory evidence, he is disinclined to accept the view that such a sextant ever existed in Hawaii. While the angle obtained with the present specimen would ob- viously not correspond to the bearing of the pole-star, for the Solomon Islands are south of the Equator and the Pole-star is not visible from them, it might quite possibly have been used to obtain a sight on some other star either for navigational or divinatory purposes. This suggestion offers at least a possible explanation of its peculiarities, even though the evidence in its favour is admittedly slight, and the writer is unaware of any other example in museums. A.
