The strikingly flat plain south of Lake Chad is punctuated by elevated mound villages, some still inhabited, others long abandoned. This region has attracted European investigators since the late nineteenth century: travelers and colonial officers conducted reconnais- sance missions, surveying the landscape, sketching ethnographic maps, and collecting oral traditions. Their accounts make repeated references to a people named Sao, who are claimed to have been both the actual and mythical ancestors of present-day popula- tions, and to have been responsible for the construction of the raised walled cities that fringe the river courses across the plain. These legends also describe the Sao as a race of giants who arrived from the east, flattening the plain and hollowing out rivers with the extraordinary strength of their hands. The huge terracotta urns (most 1-1.4 meters in height) that are uncovered periodically by erosion and used today as grain stores or dye pits are explained as having been Sao drink- ing vessels. Similar stories are still current among the Kotoko, who live on many sites associated with the Sao and are considered their most direct descendants. These tantalizing allusions to an ancient, vanished population have stimulated the curiosity of archaeologists. A series of excava- tions was undertaken and reports published in the 20s and 30s, but it has been the continu- ous work of Jean-Paul and Annie Lebeuf for the last forty years that has yielded the most information. They have accomplished con- siderable ethnographic and archaeological re- search in this area, endeavoring to discover more about the Sao. Although they now con- sider the Sao disappeared, remains of their civilization survive archaeologically, and they are presumed to have had earlier associations with populations still living in the area, espe- cially the Kotoko. Jean-Paul Lebeuf with Mar- cel Griaule completed a program of intensive excavations at seven mound sites in 1939, and the first site reports and ethnographies were published in the late 40s and early 50s. In these and subsequent publications, the Lebeufs have based their analyses on three fundamental and mutually related assump- tions: that there is a history of Sao migration, occupation and dispersion that can be recon- structed from the literature and can serve as a framework for understanding the archaeolog- ical material; that the Kotoko are direct de- scendants of the Sao; and that the Kotoko are therefore reliable informants in matters relat- ing to the Sao. Les Arts des Sao is a synthesis of the over forty years of investigation accomplished by the Lebeufs. It includes material previously published and also incorporates new informa- tion. The text is divided into three main sec- tions, summarizing respectively the results of their historical, ethnographic and archaeolog- ical research. The introductory chapter pro- vides a geographical and historical back- ground for the data and analyses that follow. The second section outlines the objectives of the archaeological research and gives an overview of the results of excavations thus far accomplished. The final chapter classifies the materials recovered from field excavations and makes interpretations based on ethno- graphic investigations. Special ecological factors have conditioned life in the plain south of Lake Chad since the second millenium B.C. The most potent and distinctive is a seasonal inundation that con- verts the landscape into an impassable marsh- land. During the rainy season the only possi- ble place to live is in villages elevated on high mounds that are then isolated for these four months of the year. For the remainder of the year the plain is extremely hard but relatively fertile, and has thus been comparatively at- tractive to groups migrating out of less favor- able climatic conditions. The Lebeufs have re- constructed a history of population move- ments into this area from at least the seventh century A.D. Based on Arab chronicles, ac- counts of European travelers (Nachtigal, Barth, Palmer), and current oral traditions, the Lebeufs claim that by the tenth century, groups from the north (Kanem), the east (Lake Fitri) and the southwest (Mandara) had moved into the plain, amalgamating into and developing what has been called the "Sao culture." The Sao maintained cultural and political autonomy until the fourteenth cen- tury, when their dominance was challenged by the armies of the Empire of Bornu. It was not, however, until the late sixteenth century that the Sao were finally defeated. The Lebeufs believe that they consequently dis- persed in a number of directions, virtually disappearing from their mound settlements in the Lake Chad periphery. 'I S ?~ S. SA 103</page><page sequence="2">Working from this historical reconstruc- tion, the Lebeufs have undertaken extensive reconnaissance and have identified over 650 "Sao" mound sites. They have proposed a three-part chronological sequence based on morphological features and corresponding with successive movements of people into the area: Sao I, Sao II, and Sao III. The excava- tions, completed in 1960 under the sponsor- ship of the Institut National Tchadien pour les Sciences Humaines (an agency developed by Lebeuf to foster archaeological study in Chad), yielded samples from which radiocar- bon dates were derived. Fifteen dates were determined using materials submitted from three sites, suggesting occupancy from 425 B.C. to the eighteenth century A.D., data the Lebeufs feel support their tripartite periodiza- tion. Appendix 4 details the results of C14 laboratory analyses. The two following chapters summarize the archaeological features characterizing Sao I, Sao II, and Sao III. The data are not presented in the manner of a site report or a formal ethnographic account but rather as an over- view of stratigraphic configurations and rep- resentative object types. The first of these two chapters focuses on the general features of Sao settlement mounds and concludes that on the basis of stratigraphic disposition and Kotoko analogues, materials seem to have been associated primarily with one of four contexts: burials, house foundations, cult and initiation sites and metallurgic workshops. Details of stratigraphy are not provided, ex- cept that two levels for Sao I (ancient and recent) and three levels for Sao II (ancient, middle, and recent) have been distinguished. The most numerous and varied finds were associated with ritual or sacred contexts. Bur- ials were the most frequent, and interment took a number of forms; most were discov- ered in single or double urn tombs, which explains the actual function of the legendary Sao "drinking vessel." These burials con- tained the richest grave goods: a profusion of ornaments made of terracotta, bronze, carne- lian, quartz and glass, terracotta figurines and smaller vessels. In the next chapter the Lebeufs organize the objects unearthed at Sao sites according to their material of manufacture: terracotta, metal, bone and ivory, stone, glass and vege- table. They then identify the salient features of style, size and provenance for representa- tive object types of each material category. Terracotta production apparently far ex- ceeded in variety and extent any other aspect of their material culture and was used for domestic wares, tools, weapons, ornaments, pipe bowls, musical instruments, toys (3-5- centimeter figurines), monetary symbols, grave goods and anthropomorphic figures. The range of ceramic figurines is treated in the most detail, and the Lebeufs propose a stylistic classification of the anthropomorphic heads (mostly 8-12 centimeters in height) that have been found at most sites in particularly large quantities. They maintain that the en- semble of heads studied (over 300 from 23 sites) is suitable for classification according to form, site and level provenance, and as- sociated materials. A congruence between style, context and stratigraphic disposition among sites, however, is yet to be established on the basis of their presentation. Although patterns of stylistic similarities and contextual association do emerge, the utility of such a breakdown is questionable without greater archaeological confirmation. Objects made of iron or a copper alloy formed the second largest category of mate- rial. Ornaments of bronze produced by the lost-wax method predominated, most often associated with burials. Although the Lebeufs claim the Kotoko are no longer metallurgists and could provide little information, two bronze specialists studied the Sao examples and made detailed proposals for their con- struction and offered a number of diagrams and reconstruction drawings. The Lebeufs have also made suggestions for some of the possible origins of both the minerals used and their means of manufacture. Three appen- dixes contain the reports of spectrographic analysis done on the coppery objects found at one site (Mdaga), at a range of Sao sites, and at a contemporary bronze-working center in northern Cameroon. The Lebeufs have generalized the results of excavations at a range of sites located within the circumscribed "Sao" area. Their presenta- tion seems to imply that the more than 650 mounds therein can be expected to manifest similar archaeological patterns. The authors, however, have emphasized that certain fea- tures of sites and site levels do not fit into their prescribed categories. The number of excep- tions to the rule may undermine the validity of this overview both for the purposes of the present synthesis and for future excavations. Moreover, repeated identification of these ir- regularities becomes rather cumbersome in an introduction to a relatively unfamiliar area. It may have been more manageable to have in- corporated specific data into a series of charts. The conclusion of Les Arts des Sao recapitu- lates the methodological synthesis of ethnog- raphy and archaeology characterizing the Le- beufs' research ("On s'est toujours appli- quo, pendant le diroulement des travaux, A ne pas separer l'archdologie du present," p. 178). They have used Kotoko explanations concerning the form, technique and function of excavated materials throughout the text. Finally the Lebeufs explain that the systems of decoration on ceramic wares (and funerary 104</page><page sequence="3">urns in particular) describe thoughts and be- liefs of the Sao people. They suggest through iconographic analysis that geometric motifs create ideographic links between the metaphysical and terrestrial realms. Al- though the authors nowhere clearly state their sources, it is presumed that the Kotoko were their direct informants here as well. The assumption that the Kotoko can elucidate the meanings of Sao objects 300-500 years after they were made is especially problematical when no parallel Kotoko iconic systems are described or reproduced. Les Arts des Sao gives the Lebeufs' conclu- sions concerning the sequence of occupation in the zone south of Lake Chad and the nature of the dominant people and culture of the pre-seventeenth-century period. In their ear- lier publications they gave a provisional and heuristic three-part chronology and historical reconstruction; here they articulate it more confidently and consider it substantiated by the archaeological evidence. There are, how- ever, criticisms to be made regarding their a priori assumptions about the Sao, their re- liance on Kotoko information, their excava- tion techniques and reportage, and their final evaluations. West African archaeologists such as Thurstan Shaw, Graham Connah, Nicholas David and Paul Ozanne have briefly referred to the problems associated with the Lebeufs' research, especially with respect to the lack of a stratigraphically established se- quence and the need for drastic modification of the Sao periodizations on the basis of the excavations and dates from recent work ac- complished in Nigeria and Chad. Ronald Cohen also has challenged the validity of the appellation "Sao," an umbrella term that ap- pears to have been used generally by Arab chroniclers to identify dark-skinned Sudanic peoples, and therefore not precisely as- sociated with any one ethnic or linguistic en- tity. Although the present review is not the place for closer consideration of such issues, they do give legitimate grounds for criticism of Les Arts des Sao. Nor does this text fully account for the pro- cess by which the Lebeufs determined the identity of the people occupying the zone south of Lake Chad and the manner of their arrival. It is still doubtful whether the Sao I-II-III periodization can be adequately sub- stantiated by archaeological research, espe- cially since, as noted above, there are so many exceptions to generalizations in this regard. Additionally, the separation of the historical reconstruction from the excavation reports, without a clear account of their correlations, further suggests that perhaps hypotheses made concerning the Sao were a priori formu- lations. The lack of consistency and specificity in the Lebeufs' approach could also be an ob- stacle to specialists wanting description and placement data about excavated materials without the interference of analysis or ethno- graphic correlations. The photographs taken by Dominique Dar- bois have been arranged to correspond with developments in the text and therefore do not serve to clarify site or category descriptions.</page><page sequence="4">The lack of captions directly under the photo- graphs is an inconvenience over which the authors may have had no control. Lighting of the black-and-white photographs has been controlled to favor expression rather than de- scription, and many of the surfaces and tex- tures are lost in harsh shadows or near dark- ness. The color photographs, however, are far better and do permit a closer examination of surface detail and overall craftsmanship. The illustrations represent object types unevenly, as is most notable in the total absence of a single photograph of a terracotta funerary urn, the distinguishing "Sao" feature. It is unfortunate that from among the large amount of material excavated, better and more wide-ranging photographs could not have been incorporated. Les Arts des Sao presents a much-needed introduction to the arts of a little-known re- gion of West Africa. The materials the Lebeufs have recovered from their extensive excava- tions are a unique contribution to the ar- chaeological record. Their number and vari- ety are testimony to the ceramic and metallur- gic skill of the peoples who lived south of Lake Chad. The importance of this area for early African history is recognized by ar- chaeologists, geologists and historians be- cause of its dominating position in the center of the continent and its attraction to popula- tions moving southward out of the Sahara. Among the investigations undertaken by others, one may single out Graham Connah, an English archaeologist, who has done work at a series of mound sites in the Nigerian end of the continuous plain south of the lake. His work at the Daima mound in particular is con- sidered a primary key to the prehistoric chronology of Nigeria. His carefully con- trolled excavations and meticulous strati- graphic analyses are models for future excava- tions. A re-assessment of the valuable data collected by the Lebeufs, using a more rigor- ous investigative approach, should help us better understand the history of peoples and arts of the Lake Chad region.
