THE RIGHT PROMETHEAN FIRE. Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1980. Hassan's latest book (his seventh, by my count) takes for its title a phrase from Berowne's sophistical defense of the claims of eros over the asceticism of the academy in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost. Its sub- title indicates that its subject or field of investigation comprises "Imagina- tion, Science, and Cultural Change." Taken together, title and sub-title constitute an implicit judgment or scale of values, on the one side, and a convergence of interests, on the other. The book points to a celebration of love and the "female principle" as antidote to the potentially destructive powers of the intellect and masculine will which, especially in modern science, threaten the "future of the species." The text proper of The Right Promethean Fire is preceded by a full- page representation, in greyish-black, of an S-shaped brush stroke on a white field; five epigraphs; a dedication (to Ihab Hassan's first wife: "For B. Hassan-Koten"); a Table of Contents; Acknowledgements; and a "Per- sonal Preface." The body of the book consists of five chapters, separated by four excerpts (edited and revised) from journals which Hassan kept while writing the book. "The journal," Hassan notes, discloses no intimate facts, events; still it avows a degree of subjectivity, perhaps of intersubjectivity, which I hope can modify the incantatory abstractions of the Promethean theme. The journal suffers its own abstractions; indeed, it seems at times less journal than allegory-product, Allen Tate might say, of an "angelic" rather than "symbolic" imagination. Though less iconic in my tastes than Tate, I recognize this tendency in myself and try to texture it with travel notes, historical gossip, incongru- ous sources, sundry styles. The journal, after all, was not meant to muse eternity but to slip behind certain scenes of the writing self. [p. xvii] On the other hand, Hassan is quick to point out, these "subjective" moments should not be taken as linking him to those strains of current critical writing which justify their "freeplay" on the grounds of a belief in the fictionality of the self. I can not pretend to have "dispersed" or "displaced" myself entirely: my sense of both self and self's other self, death, finally 50 DIACRITICS Vol. 10 Pp. 50-59 0300-7162/80/0104-0050 $01.00 " 1980 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">inhibits that game. Part diary and part allegory, a commonplace book and a little dictionary of quotations, the journal, in the end, neither answers nor confesses but patterns certain motifs, mild obsessions of a writing day. [Ibid.] These passages can be taken to indicate that, if he has not "entirely" dispersed or displaced "himself," Hassan is already at work dispersing and displacing his own text. Placed in the text as antidote to an "angelic" tendency, an abstractive and iconic impulse, the journal is characterized as "part diary" and "part allegory" which, "in the end, neither answers nor confesses," but rather only "patterns certain motifs" them- selves qualified as "mild obsessions of a writing day." So, the journal is there in the text, but is already being guarded against normal readerly expectations. And indeed the journal is more allegory than diary, does "pattern" more than "answer" or "confess." But its "obsessions" are not "mild." Behind the chat of "travel notes, historical gossip, incongruous sources, and sundry styles," we catch a glimpse of the existentialist concerns of Ihab Hassan, the human anxieties that impel the critic. Here the themes of death, illness, the bad faith re- quired to live in the social situation are all present. But they have been "angelicized"; their "symbolic" content is virtually nil. They appear as "motifs" indeed, but they lack an "archetype." But they display a desire for the archetypal, a desire frustrated, I surmise, by the total absence of any sense of the religious moment in either culture or personality. Hassan's allegiances are primarily aesthetic, but he aspires to the ethical (I use these terms in a Kierkegaardian sense). The latter moment surfaces, however, only in the journal sections of his book. In the other sections of the text proper, it is present only as aspiration; here the aesthetic moment remains dominant. And because it does, the book's "argument," its thesis, must be dispersed across opposed, not to say, contradictory positions: coldly "realistic" on the one side, bleakly "utopian" on the other. This is not a defect. And it accounts in part, I trust, for the self-consciously disjunctive style of the essays on "imagination, science, and cultural change." Hassan follows his remarks on the journal entries by a discussion of the function of quotation in his book. The long strings of quotations, fractured quotations, montages of quotations, seemingly contradictory quotations, etc., which break up his text, Hassan says, represent a "tendency or correlative" that is antithetical to the "sub- jectivity" of the journal extracts. They "act less as escutcheon than mosaic of a col- lective dream" or, alternatively, "they may constitute a kind of music, gnostic yet full of noise, aspiring Babel and wise babble, the sound of our being there" [p. xviii]. And again, these gaggles of quotations are offered as visual marks of the "ruptures and diremptions" in the text, signs that his text aspires to establish "neither a continuous nor discontinuous relation" among the several "parts" that make up the whole. Hassan explicitly renounces the aim of closure, completeness, integrity, coherence (and one must surmise, even correspondence) for his text. And yet, and yet: the dream of closure is still there, implicitly in the journal sections, explicitly in the preface. These remarks by Hassan on the form of his text come in the third section of the Preface. The first two sections help us to identify what Hassan conceives to be the book's principal concerns: "imagination, science, and cultural change in our time, leaning into the future" [p. xiii]. The "informing sense" of the book, we are told, is that "imagination--empowered by science, extended to technology, enacted by us--has shaped, and still continues to shape, a world which we awkwardly call post- modern, posthumanist." Whence the significance of the "symbol" that presides over the text's elaboration: "the figure of a gnostic Prometheus" which "remains to mock our hope" [p. xv]. This figure points us to what he calls his "arch theme," identified as "Imagination" which, "telological or not, . . . makes our future, is our fate" [p. xvi]. But no sooner is this "arch theme" identified than it is splintered into a congeries of themes: desire, hope, change; ambitions and afflictions of the humanities; the im- manence of languages, the indeterminacies of knowledge and action; a new diacritics/December 1980 51</page><page sequence="3">play between wholes and parts, or the One and the Many as philosophers used to say; politics, history, the transhumanization of the earth; the role of mind-self made and from itself concealed-in the universe; death, first literally, then as metaphor of change; finally, as a language the cosmos speaks to us when we calm our fears. [p. xvi] These themes, however, are no sooner entered into the lists than they are framed by a question: "Are these fit topics or tropes for a gnostic Prometheus?" Which is in turn followed by an assertion of a certitude: "I am certain only that they are part of the human project, our own gnosis" [p. xvi]. The "Promethean" grandiosity of this list of themes and concerns Hassan grace- fully submits to his own ironic distantiation by disclaiming any "mystical illuminations" or "perfervid answers" to the questions he poses. Still, the book is sent forth with the hope that it at least takes certain "risks" [p. xxi]. What are these risks? In the last section of the Preface, they are sublimated overtly into an attitude of simply yielding to a query in an attitude prayer. But the prayer is only a "small" one and the addressee of it remains unspecified: Yet if this work has any intimation of something beyond itself, it is simply this: where Life truly matters, where it makes and remakes itself most fully, power and its human psychomachias dissolve. Where precisely is this blessed region? In the mind, of course, though where else I do not know. This book-fragment of an autobiography, meditation on science and imagina- tion, small prayer for change-simply yields itself to that query. [p. xxi] In the book which preceeded this one, Paracriticisms [Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1975], Hassan characterized himself as a "witness to the New" and as an "amateur of change" [p. xiii]. And this self-characterization is certainly justified, for change functions as a value in Hassan's thought. He uses it as a ground for choosing his objects of study and to define his principal function as a critic. He has always taken the role of mediator between the emergently new, strange, and exotic, on the one side, and that reflexive suspicion of anything new which a tired academic culture substitutes for the open mindedness on which it prides itself, on the other. Hassan is never put off by anything new, strange, or even seemingly monstrous; he rather takes any deviation from the normal as evidence of life's power to renew itself, if not with new contents, then at least with new forms. Whence, I suspect, his admiration for Bergson, Teilhard, Brown, Fuller, etc. But I sense in the relentlessness with which Hassan pursues the new the urgency of an essentially aesthetic intelligence striving to become ethical, a search for a standard other than a purely "musical" one (as he calls it in Paracriticisms) by which to endow the passage of time and the transiency of an individual life with a "value." This accounts, in part at least, for his turn to "cultural criticism" in his last two books, in contrast to his first three, which were more manifestly (but only manifestly) concerned with "literature." But he has not been able to go into the ethical; he remains on its confines, circling its borders, sniffing at it, always supicious of it, inclined to leap over it into the religious, if only he could believe in the sacred. This is why his recent texts read like endless prefaces. He heeds the command to "Take and read," but he can find no holy book. I have featured Hassan's prefaces, which are really, if I am justified in my charac- terization of his position, prefaces to prefaces, in accordance with the insights that Derrida has provided us with in his own preface to La dissimination. Derrida stresses the narcissistic nature of every preface; its fatherly regard for its progeny, the text, for which it is intended to prepare the way; and its futile effort to find the authority of the text in some solid ontological ground. I was driven to this tactic because of the incon- clusive nature of Hassan's book, but also by the weight of the "front matter" that pre- cedes it. The S-shaped figure to which I alluded earlier also appeared in Paracriticisms, though it was executed there in a different style. There it was printed in a tone more 52</page><page sequence="4">grey than black, more Roman and "monumental," more stylized than the figure heralding the latest book, which appears to have been made by a single stroke of a brush. I surmise that this S can stand for "Sally," the name of Hassan's wife, who figures prominently in Fire as a kind of "co-author" (see the Acknowledgements) and as quoted "authority" in the journal sections. It may stand, too, for Shakespeare, who furnished Hassan with part of his title. The S-shape also suggests the Moebius strip which is currently fashionable as a representation of the "turn" of a text through its own center. And of course it reminds one of the form of a serpent, an association justified by Hassan's use of the term "gnosticism," the Ophitic strain of which, in ancient times, featured reverence for the serpent in Eden as a prototype of Jesus himself. All this is fanciful, I confess; but the associations seem justified by the allusion to Berowne's speech in Love's Labour's Lost, which, on one reading at least, holds up the "female principle" as redeemer of the cruel trickery of a Promethean, masculine intellection. Indeed, the "new Gnosticism" appears to be the progeny, in Hassan's myth, of a wedding of Prometheanism with what, in Paracriticisms, he calls "the female principle of creation" [pp. 127-31 ]. And as in a gnostic dream, matter dissolves before the Light. [Para., p. 123] To be sure, Hassan disavows any interest in "the old Gnostic religions." He is concerned, he says, "with a new sense of im-mediacy of Mind, of complete gnosis or knowledge.... The New Gnosticism assumes that the more consciousness increases, the more Fact and Fancy will converge" [Para., pp. 144-46]. These notions, laid out in Paracriticism, indicate a much more ambitious program than Hassan is inclined openly to embrace, given his professions of having no anwers and to be merely offering "suggestions" for consideration. But the list of "concerns" to which he admits in the last section of the first essay of Fire, entitled "The Critic as Innovator: A Paratactical Strip in X Frames," is enough to confirm that he aspires to be much more than simply a "surveyer" of opinions. This list of concerns includes: 1. Theories of the Imagination 2. The Politics of the Imagination 3. The Future 4. Mythology and Technology 5. The One and the Many [Fire, p. 26] These are not small problems. And they are not avoided in the rest of his book. Indeed, the list indicates the subject-matter of the five essays which form the skeleton of the work. But these subjects, themes, or topoi are insulated from one another by the mini-genres (called "montages" and "slippages") that precede and follow them in Hassan's explication. The list of "concerns" is contained in a section labelled "FRAME NINE." It is preceded by a "MONTAGE" which dilates on "The Gap of Hope" that separates criticism from its several possible objects of reflection. And it is followed by a "SLIPPAGE" which consists of a meditation on language and Hassan's own status as a wanderer in alien climes and regions: He wonders: "what language of childhood can I call my own?" [Hassan was born and raised in Cairo and educated in Europe and the United States.] Having reinvented himself in a "foreign" tongue, has he lost all sense of "foreignness"? Having escaped his "first" language, has he also escaped the primal censor or authority? diacritics/December 1980 53</page><page sequence="5">This reverie provides the passage from the list of "concerns" given in FRAME NINE to FRAME TEN, which suggests a desire to draw back from the enormity of the task of adequately dealing with them. This latter FRAME, which features as its centerpiece a quotation from another self-styled "wanderer" of our time, George Steiner, ends with, first, a disdainful look at the "fear of arbitrariness in criticism" and, then, a figuration of criticism itself as "the Unnecessary Angel" whose claim to reveal "the earth again" is undercut by the "transparence" which all angels have [p. 28]. After this essay, we are presented with the first excerpts from Hassan's journals, a section of text which bears, as its epigraph, Valery's famous mot; ". . . there is no theory that is not a fragment, carefully concealed, of some autobiography" [p. 28]. Then, after the journal, there follows Chapter 2 of the text, entitled "The Re-vision of Literature: Rhetoric, Imagination, Vision." All of these shifts and transitions, disjunctions and deformations, lists and quota- tions put a heavy burden on the reader. There is little pleasure in this text, certainly not the kind of pleasure that Barthes speaks of in his seductive essay. Hassan wishes to make the reader work, and work hard. What is he getting at? Of course, the message is in the spaces of the text, in the transitions which are only implied and never openly provided on the text's surface. Or rather, the text is all surface, intended only to suggest the presence of a "depth" which refuses to speak. So much is suggested (but only suggested) by the first journal entry. It reads: Some believe the end of a book is one's own end. Not i. Six months now without a word on paper. What happiness! "I no longer know how to speak" (Rimbaud). But the task is to place oneself beyond all such agonies. Let the hand pick up the pen again, the words start or cease like a familiar disease. No finger on pulse. Pulsars will throb, in any case, on the edge of mind. [p. 32] The form of this passage, if not the content, bears the signature of one who has self- consciously embraced the writer's role. But in what culture? Of what epoch? Hassan invokes Gide as authority for the use of the journal form as a means of "interrogating the genre of academic criticism" [p. xviii]; but it must be confessed, as he himself has noted, the journal entries are not less abstract than the theoretical sections of his text. They are simply abstract in a different way. I am inclined to think that Hassan regards abstractions as more real, certainly more compelling, than any mere concretion. And why not? Especially, however, for a thinker like Hassan, who values "style" over such fetishes of the conventional humanism as content, reality, truth. This would be consistent with his admiration of Nietzsche. Not, to be sure, the Nietzsche of Walter Kauffman, not the moralist Nietzsche, but rather Nietzsche the formalist who recognized that every form is itself a content, whether in nature or in art, and indeed a content more valuable than anything that any "essentialist" doctrine might provide. Consider, by way of evidence in support of this last generalization, the five epigraphs that are offered at the beginning of Fire as a "mosaic of a collective dream." First, Berowne's speech in Love's Labour's Lost: "women's eyes ... are the books, the arts, the academes,/ that show, contain, and nourish all the world,/ else none at all in aught proves excellent." Next, from Goethe's Faust II: "Formation, transforma- tion,/ Eternal mind's eternal recreation,? Girt round by images of all things that be,/ They [the Mothers] do not see you, forms alone they see." Third, from Shelley: . Familiar acts are beautiful through love;/ Labour, and pain, and grief, in life's green grove/ Sport like tame beasts, none knew how gentle they could be!" Then, from Emerson's History: "What else am I who laughed or wept yesterday,/ And what see I on any side but the transmigrations of Proteus .. " Finally, from Shaw, the dialogue between Eve and the Serpent: "Eve: Find me one word for it all:/ you who are so clever. Serpent: In one word, to conceive. .. " These quotations all point to what Hassan in his second essay calls "metaphor of metaphor" and which he identifies with "imagination" itself, "a power dynamic, 54</page><page sequence="6">.. ...... . . .. .. .. .. . . . . . ...... -m:p . ....... 1 0i ...... . ... ..... mutant, and transformative" [p. 62]. Metaphor of metaphor is form raised to the nth power. Behind every form is another: form itself is the only "value." Strange con- junction, the wedding of Plato with Nietzsche! Only a modern Hellenisticist such as Hassan could imagine it. The formalist, or rather, following the late Stephen Pepper's coinage, the formist impulse of Hassan appears most clearly in the third essay of Fire, the literal center- piece of the text, which is a virtual carnival, a revel of typographical disjunctions and discursive inversions, attended by what appears to be abstract brush representations, in the margins, of Marcel Duchamp's emblematic alias "Rrose Selavy." [See Fire, p. 38, and Chapter 3 passim. ] This essay is entitled "Culture, Indeterminacy, and Immanence: Margins of the (Postmodern) Age" and culminates in a section labelled "The Evidence of Our Time." This section begins: "What evidence may we expect from our (post- modern) culture? Perhaps only evidence circumstantial: social bric-a-brac, intellectual bricolage, bright shards of a disestablished imagination, all jangling their peculiar themes and variations." Hassan then "hazards seven related themes, in advertence to that cultural jangle." These consist of the following motifs: a. Indeterminacy (which fills the void between the will to unmaking and the integrative will) b. Process and Change (which suggests the triumph of flux) c. The Diffractions of the Self (its exercise in our cultural moment) d. The Displacements of Desire (considered as the tropisms of love) e. The Immanence of Media (which, by their staging of historical events, turn history into a "happening") f. The Marriage of Earth and Sky (which has intimations of the triumph of androgeny) g. The New Gnosticism, or the Dematerialization of Existence (which augurs the triumph of "fictions" as the stuff of all knowledge. [pp. 109-111] The items in this list alone suggest the extent to which Hassan is obsessed with the phenomena of process. Unmaking, flux, diffraction, tropism, etherealization: these notions justify his central thought about the dissolution of the distinction between the fictional and the real. I was reminded of Henry Adams as I read Hassan, and I was diacritics/December 1980 55</page><page sequence="7">gratified to find him cited or quoted at least four times. And incidentally, Hassan features his own "Americanness" prominently in the work. Perhaps this explains in part his disbelief in the very concept of "content." It is certain that, for him, "content" is dissolved as surely as "matter" is replaced by "energy" in science and "play" replaces "reverence" in religion. And this disbelief in the reality of any fixed "content" may account in part for his desire for what might be called "a visual metaphysics," which leads him to substitute "seeing" for the "speaking-hearing" function that has dominated Western thought since its inception in the Platonic program. That "imagination" which Hassan consistently celebrates over both the cognitive and ethical faculties (to use the familiar Kantian taxonomy) is a visual faculty. Its knowledge, like its pleasures, is scoptophiliac, rather than tactile. In The Dismember- ment of Orpheus, Hassan had hailed Blake and Sade together as standing "at the threshold of the modern experience, exemplars of two kinds of gnosticism," both of which provide access to a knowledge that is ultimately visual in nature. And indeed, the notion of a visual knowledge has fascinated him from the beginning of his career as a scholar. What other kinds of pleasure could a "radical innocence" (the title of his first book) offer? What other kinds of knowledge could a "literature of silence" (the title of his second book) claim? I suspect that the notion of a knowledge purely visual is what underlies Hassan increasingly obsessive attention to the visual aspects of his text: the variations in typeface, the discursive disjunctions, the pastiche of quotations, the marginal figures, and so forth ... The notion of a knowledge purely visual also underwrites his view of science and must justify the willed'optimism which he derives from his contemplation of modern, electronic science and its technology in our time. In the fourth essay of Fire, entitled "The Gnosis of Science: A Paratactical Pastiche," as he comes to the end of his thesis about the ways in which the dyad "art and technology" replace the older conjunction "science and religion," he asks two questions: "How, then, may change recover from itself continuous value?" and "How can vision create value before it is valued?" And his answers to these questions call up once more the image of a knowledge that is purely formist: "Perhaps only if Process prove a trope of Being, the Future a figure of Desire, and Language itself the form our Immanence takes. This is certain: without a tomorrow, we die today, yet today is all we are vouchsafed" [p. 170; my italics]. In this "pastiche" of quotations and speculations about the meaning of science in our time, Hassan draws upon the data (or more precisely, the hearsay) of physics, biology, and cybernetics to justify belief in the emergence of an "organismic" consensus among science's visionaries. Science, too, becomes, as much as art, an endless play of forms which figure forth the single message that life endlessly renews itself, whatever the fate of a given species. This, presumably, is the gnosis of science. Yet the journal entries which separate this upbeat re-vision of the gnosis of science from the last essay of the book bespeak a different mood, more uncertainty about what this gnosis teaches. At the end of a brief meditation on the possibility that "History" might be "a tale told by all, signifying nothing," Hassan poses another question: "Perhaps all our gnosis comes to this: the mind is (insufficient to?) itself" [p. 178]. This section of the text also relates a meeting between Hassan and Queen Fabiola of Belgium, which took place at Villa Serbelloni, on Lake Como, a hostel now run by the Rockefeller Foundation for the international scholarly aristocracy. Hassan and the Queen discussed "power" and its uses, and the discussion inspires in Hassan a nostalgic look at the fate of royalty, aristocracy, and noble courtesy in the modern age. Significantly, the look turns to a consideration of "titles"-- both of the noble and the textual variety. "Titles, words to slow death by, turning time into place. Eponyms. ?. We go through the ages living in each other's houses, leaving only such traces as language, gnostic babble, vouchsafes" [p. 182]. "Vouchsafe" is a word that appears often in Hassan's discourse. It is consistent with the slightly stiff, mannered, almost archaic but certainly hieratic style of Hassan, but it also points to a central concern of his work. For who or what is authorized to "vouchsafe" anything to us now? Who or what is capable of standing surety for another, of conferring by an act of "grace" any "privilege" on ourselves or our progeny? And consider the irony contained in the 56</page><page sequence="8">history of this word, the usage of which slides uneasily between the notion of "con- ferment" or "bestowal," on the one side, and that of "condescension," on the other. The image of the death of grace presides over the "revel of forms" which Hassan has glimpsed, no less than over that "carnival of contents" that he has abandoned. We are packing, Sally asks: "How is your Prometheus?" I look up, quote Emerson whom I have been rereading: 'The Prometheus Vinctus is the romance of scepticism.' So much for the gods-and our writing." I snap the suitcase shut, ready to travel, remembering that my mother for six months before her death, always kept a fully packed suitcase in her bedroom. [p. 183] The last essay of Hassan's book wears the form of the masque. It is entitled "Prometheus as Performer: Toward a Posthumanist Culture? A University Masque in Five Scenes," and is introduced by no less than nine epigraphs; from The Vedanta, Plotinus, Blake, Einstein, Mao, Eliade, Nietzsche, Melville, and Shakespeare (in that order). This masque raises the question of the future of "culture" itself in a "post- humanist" world. The characters of the masque are named Pretext, Mythotext, Heterotext, Context, Metatext, Postext, and Paratext, this last described as "inaudible in print . . and who has already appeared as a version of the speaker." [p. 189]. The "action" (?) unfolds over a "Pretext," Five Scenes, and a "Postext" and consists of what I take to be an encounter among parodistic personifications of the currently regnant critical modes. Each of these modes is presented as inhabiting a different domain of the critical field, and their encounters are intended (so it seems) to "perform the indefinitions of a posthumanist moment" [Ibid.]. To my taste, this is the least successful part of Hassan's book. The conceit of a "university masque" is a poor vehicle to carry the burden of ending so ambitious a book. It is, of course, consistent with Hassan's fiction that he here (formally) absents himself from his text and feigns appearing only as director or stagemanager of the exchanges about the future of a "posthumanist culture" that he (indirectly) surveys. To be sure, the archness, prissiness, and superciliousness of the speeches that he gives to his characters are consistent with the Love's Labour's Lost-thesis of the book as a whole. But the "Hellenistic" nature of this farago of shards of texts, quotations, paraphrases, etc., which makes up the "argument" of the masque, works against the burden of the argument which consists of the five topoi that I have identified as the "subject-matter" of the five essays comprising the book as a whole. Why choose the masque as the form of this last essay? Well, I surmise that it is because the real theme of the text is the relationship between "power" and "culture," the proper matter of the masque, according to Angus Fletcher and John Arthos. Hassan's aim, I take it, is to satirize the presumption of an outmoded humanism's efforts to come to terms with, set limits on, instruct, or otherwise educate the servants of a specifically modern, scientific and technological power. Accordingly, Hassan might have considered using another traditional form, the anti-masque, for this purpose, rather than the pseudo-masque that he has in fact chosen. His is a pseudo- masque because the monarchical principle, that center of order and authority which reveals itself at the end of the traditional masque, is lacking. There is no principle of authority to which Hassan can appeal to mediate between power and culture, just as there is no principle of knowledge to which he can appeal, in his "new gnosticism," for mediating the relationship between "art" and "science." And the "Postext" which addresses us after the last scene is finished can only summon up, once more, that figure of death which presides over every "masque" that lacks a sense of center, closure, authority. Is it not finally plain? Prometheus, gnostic, dreamer, prophet, Titan trans- gressor and trickster, giver of fire, maker of culture- Prometheus is our performer. He performs Space and Time; he performs Desire. He suffers. diacritics/December 1980 57</page><page sequence="9">We are ourselves that performance; we perform and are performed every moment. We are the pain and play of the Human, which will not re- main human. We are both Earth and Sky, Water and Fire. We are the phoenix form of Desire. Everything changes, and nothing, not even Death, can tire. [p. 207]. In his epilogue to The Gnostic Religion [Boston: Beacon Press, 1958], Hans Jonas dilates on the similarities between ancient and modern "nihilism," as represented by Gnosticism, on the one side, the Existentialism, on the other; but he discerned one "cardinal difference" between them: Gnostic man is thrown into an antagonistic, anti-divine, and therefore anti- human nature, modern man into an indifferent one. Only the latter case represents an absolute vacuum, the really bottomless pit. In the gnostic conception the hostile, the demonic, is still anthropomorphic, familiar even in its foreignness, and the contrast itself gives direction to existence-a negative direction, to be sure, but one that has behind it the sanction of the negative transcendence to which the positivity of the world is the qualitative counterpart. Not even this antagonistic quality is granted to the indifferent nature of modern science, and from that nature no direction at all can be elicited. [pp. 338-39] If this "difference" allows a "greater depth" to modern nihilism, Jonas continues, it also challenges its claim to any kind of self-consistency. And this because, gnostic dualism, "fantastic as it was," was self-consistent in its postulation of a "demonic nature against which the self is pitted." That "indifferent nature" of modern nihilism, however, is set over against a supposed "being" for which meaning itself is a value. Rather than speaking, in the manner of Heidegger and Sartre, of a humanity that has been "thrown" into nature, it would make more sense, Jonas argues, to speak of a "conscious, caring, knowing self. .. 'tossed up' by nature." This would permit us to view the relationship between human life and its ground in a way conformable with our sense of the telelogical impulse in the former. If human life is simply "tossed up" by nature blindly, "then the seeing is a product of the blind, the caring a product of the uncaring, a telological nature begotten unteleologically" [Ibid., p. 339]. On this view, Hassan's many tables of concerns would seem to bear more simi- larities to ancient gnosticism than he is inclined to admit. In 1969, Murray Krieger characterized Hassan as a "Neo-Romantic" critic because of his distaste for "word-worship" and "form-worship" and the "entire post-Kantian mood of our criticism of the last century and a half" [Singleton, ed., Interpretation (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1969), pp. 212-15]. This was consistent with Hassan's own characterization of himself, in Paracriticisms, as a critic in whose breast "an Existentialist, a Utopian, and an Orphist" vied for supremacy. But Krieger insisted that Hassan, all but in spite of himself, remained unsatisfied with a philosophy of pure act and was drawn to convert every seemingly meaningless action into "an intellectual gesture." In what he calls Hassan's "more balanced view," Krieger concluded, "the poet resists total identity with Dionysus in a turning upon himself [that] allows for the poet's turning of the antibook into his book." And as a consequence, Krieger says, "this is a reintroduction of aesthetic mediation" into Hassan's thought [Ibid., pp. 217- 18]. What Krieger put his finger on, I think, was an equivocation in Hassan's thought that has marked it from its earliest appearance in Radical Innocence. On the one hand, there was the consistent celebration of the demonic, the underground, the deviant convention in Western literature, from Sade and Blake to Beckett and Henry Miller. On the other hand, there remained the reservations which Hassan continually expressed about the "naivet&amp;" of the kind of "innocence" which sought redemption through any kind of "final solution," whether in literature or in life. Over the course of his career as a critic, Hassan has sublimated this equivocation into his own brand of 58</page><page sequence="10">irony which forecloses any attempt to resolve the oppositions that he finds everywhere around himself. As he wrote at the end of The Literature of Silence [New York: Knopf, 1968], "it is when men insist on immortality, in history or in eternity, that they engage in their blackest betrayals" [p. 218] In 1975, in Paracriticisms, he signalled his desire to "break out of criticism," but the note of equivocation was still there. In the "Personal Preface" to that work, he says: "in these essays I write neither as critic nor scholar--nor yet impersonate poet, novelist or playwright-but try to find my voice in the singular forms that speculation sometimes requires." But then he could not forebear adding: "Yet what, finally, is singular? Every voice is cursed by its echo, blessed by an answer this side of mortality" [p. xi]. At the center of his concerns, he said, "is an awkward vision of change, a pressing query about the destiny of our race" and a desire to divine "what role . . ex- panding consciousness" will play in the "universe." Since he took it for granted that "humanist culture is becoming a small part of our culture, and criticism a smaller culture still," it seemed imperative to ask: "Who, then, will be left to empower our metaphors, our dreams?" [Ibid., pp. xi-xii]. Then, on a more "personal note," he added that he found "no pleasure in the literary fray." Taking a look at the current critical scene, and especially that interrogation of itself into which it had been projected by the advent of post-structuralism, he averred that he was now interested in its battles only insofar as it might help him "to formulate a theory of change, and thus become part of a design for life." But when it came to framing what he called the "last question," that is, "When will criticism confront the implications of its own queries, and what then will it become?", he confessed: "I have no answer." [Ibid., p. xv] Hassan chose Berowne's speech in Love's Labour's Lost as the source of a title for his latest book, which suggests that he takes seriously the doctrine there enunciated. But he might have equally well considered the speech of Holofernes, which the late C.L. Barber rightly cited as a necessary complement to the doctrine of love, more intellectualist than emotional, set forth by Berowne. (See Barber, Shakespeare's Festive Comedies [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1959], pp. 99-106). Considering Holo- fernes' speech- This is a gift I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it [IV, ii, 67-74]- Barber remarks: "Here, as so often in Shakespeare, the outlines of a caricature are filled in with the experience of a man: Holofernes has a rhapsody of his own, an ex- perience of the "fiery numbers" Berowne talks about-strange as his productions may be" [p. 99]. Like Berowne, Hassan is enamoured of "fiery numbers"--as any visionary is inclined to be. But his "strange productions" bespeak the existence within him of another kind of intelligence-"a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions." It is his gift, and in him it is acute. And when the occasion "mellows," I expect him to give birth to it in a voice more rhapsodic than he has hitherto displayed. diacritics/December 1980 59</page></plain_text>
