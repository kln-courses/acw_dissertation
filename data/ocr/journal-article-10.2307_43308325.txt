<plain_text><page sequence="1">When Coyote Leaves the Res: Incarnations of the Trickster from Wile E. to Le Guin Amanda Cockrell X he trickster is a character who appears across world folklore, often one who is given habitation in an animal body, too sly, too vain, too crafty to be quite human. He appears in Europe as Reynard the Fox and in Africa and the West Indies as Anansi the Spider. Most often in North America he is Old Man Coyote, creator of the world, shaper of mankind, sprinkler of the stars and general troublemaker. The genuine coyote, Canis latrans, the little yellowy-gray wolf of the southwestern desert, takes his name from the Aztec coyoti, and he is a logi- cal choice to inhabit the trickster's skin: he is wily, voracious, adaptable, and possessed of an insatiable curiosity. He is a trickster in the wild: a hunt- ing coyote will often play the clown for his prey - holding its attention by dancing on his hind legs, biting his tail, turning backflips, while his partner slinks up from the other direction. He has easily survived the incursions of man upon his territory but despite, and in actual contradiction to, his reputa- tion as a stock-killer, Coyote eats anything, including bumblebees and leather shoelaces. He likes melons, porcupines, mice, dead buzzards and leather gloves left unattended (Dobie, 110). But he is most interested in things he has never seen before. To catch a coyote, you can bait your trap with food, or sex, but better yet is something ripe to wallow in or something new to investigate. One coyote hunter reported success with a powder puff saturated with drug store perfume (Dobie, 144). And despite bounties on his hide, and the curiosity which leads him to take a bite of things he shouldn't, his tribe is increasing. Like his original, the Coyote of Native American legend is known for his cunning, is always hungry, and is killed often but never dies. He dislikes work and spends his time thinking up schemes. In a Native American Coyote story the hero either outsmarts someone else or outsmarts himself. Coyote stories are often teaching tales - Coyote tries to get more than his share of the food or to eat corn without digging his garden first. He in- sults the powerful or brags that he can perform impossible feats and is squashed for his impertinence. He sleeps with his friends' wives by trickery and steals their dinner before he leaves. He is unreliable and untidy, his 64 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="2">Amanda Cockrell jokes are crude and his sexual appetite is insatiable. He is like a dreadful un- cle, fascinating in his sheer awfiilness, whom you wish would not visit you, but who is the subject of many family stories. In the words of one Navajo fa- ther, "If my children hear these stories they'll grow up to be good people" (Tolkien, 128). These teaching stories carry the implicit moral: Don't be like Coyote. Don't be greedy, lazy, rude; it will only get you into trouble. But just as often, Old Man Coyote serves as culture hero, creating the world from mud at the bottom of the sea, scattering the stars in the sky, or stealing water from the frog people to give it to mankind. It is this duality which is the hallmark of the trickster. Not a benevolent deity, Coyote eats what falls into his jaws, and anyone who trusts him is taking that risk. Yet he is also the bringer of change, the essence of the creative spirit without which the world would become static and die. He is Picasso's "lie which makes us realize truth" (Hyde, 79). Just as coyotes have not retreated from their turf with the advent of white people and their cities, neither has Old Man Coyote left the world of story- telling. In Maidu artist Harry Fonseca's 1980 acrylic "When Coyote Leaves the Res," the trickster slides into an old role with a new wardrobe: the leader of the pack, clad in black leather jacket with chains and fancy zippers, high-heeled boots and a ring in one gray ear, lounging against a brick wall. His tail is bushy, his stance a swagger. It is easy to imagine the Harley just outside the frame (Bierhorst, Mythology, 119). In "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" Fonseca gives us 20th Century Coyote again, on the cover of the Smithso- nian's July 1998 issue of Native Peoples magazine, in Uncle Sam hat, striped pants, tailcoat, cane and fancy jogging shoes, dancing his way across a star-filled room. Canis latrans lives happily in the foothills of Los Angeles, subsisting on rodents and unwary poodles, just as Coyote inhabits the late twentieth cen- tury, telling new twentieth-century, and now twenty-first-century stories about himself. As Lewis Hyde says, the trickster is a boundary-crosser (7), and he is not easily encapsulated in the amber of folklore. He is infinitely adaptable, trotting from one form and genre to another, taking all stories and making them his. In the sixteenth century, Spanish adventurers introduced a Spanish trans- lation of Aesop's Fables to the Aztecs. One or more Aztec authors translated the stories into their own language, abandoning unfamiliar animals and giv- ing the main roles to creatures they knew, including Coyote and Puma. In 1987, John Bierhorst translated that version into English as Doctor Coyote, expanding Coyote's role and collaborating with illustrator Wendy Watson, who gave the book a setting that leaves the landscape looking very like twen- tieth-century New Mexico and Coyote looking less Aztec than Navajo. In it he retains his trickster's nature, although in the last story we see him on his deathbed, tricking his sons for their own good. He has left them a treasure, In the Arts 65</page><page sequence="3">When Coyote Leaves the Res: he says, that will ensure that they never go hungry. They will find it by dig- ging in the cornfield. Because of these cryptic last words, the coyote sons work the ground diligently, the corn grows tall and plentiful, and they are never hungry. A coyote has to be tricked into doing the sensible thing. In the Looney Tunes and Meme Melodies cartoons produced by Warner Brothers and directed by Chuck Jones, nothing will ever teach Wile E. Coy- ote to be sensible and dine on mice, or even chickens, like his natural coun- terparts. He is obsessed with having roadrunner for dinner. However it is interesting to note that someone in the Warner Brothers animation shop has paid attention to Canis latrans himself - Wile E. Coyote is anatomically ac- curate, with yellow eyes and big ears, bigger than a wolfs. Wile E. is the true descendant of the coyote of legend. In these tales, he perpetually attempts to catch the Roadrunner, employing high explosives as well as native cunning. Instead, he blows himself sky high with his own backfiring bombs, falls from thousand-foot cliffs to flatten himself at the bot- tom, or otherwise dies a violent death - from which he pops back up as good as new in the next frame, shaking the cinders from his tail. This inde- structibility has engendered protests from adults concerned by the level of violence, as well as by the notion conveyed that death is neither real nor per- manent. However this coyote remains, if not politically, then certainly myth- ologically correct. Old Man Coyote is killed often, but never dies. Grandmother Spider's web slices him into a thousand pieces. But Wind puts him back together and blows breath back into him (Hausman, 85-86). He dances with a star, falls from the sky for ten winters and is flattened. It takes many more winters for him to puff himself back up again, but one spring there he is (Erdoes, 385-386). He wants to fly with the blackbirds and convinces them to lend him feathers. But he is such a nuisance that they take his feathers away again and he falls once more. He picks himself up and slinks home, embarrassed, but he is never dead (Dobie, 284). When Wile E. Coyote is flattened by the latest gadget with which he has been attempting to defeat the Roadrunner, he is only telling the latest tale of Old Man Coyote's indestructibility. Hyde suggests that in trickster myth creative intelligence derives from appetite (17, 76). Certainly appetite for roadrunner fuels Wile E.'s ingenu- ity, and the gadgets themselves are creations which only Coyote could imag- ine - one is constructed of an electric motor, a refrigerator, a meat grinder and skis; another a street-cleaner's wagon, a weather balloon and an electric fan. In one of the few cartoons in which Wile E. actually speaks, we see him in pursuit of Bugs Bunny rather than the Roadrunner. (Perhaps because Bugs also speaks and the Roadrunner doesn't.) In this episode he has a laboratory of his own in which he invents and patents elaborate gadgets, rather than buying the components from the Acme Company, his usual supplier. Given 66 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="4">Amanda Cockrell the power of speech, he brags loudly about his genius, a trait which can be traced directly to the Old Man Coyote of legend. When magic finds its way into these cartoons, it is trickster magic, magic gone wrong, magic folded back in upon itself. In a typical episode, Wile E. constructs a false painting of a bridge to disguise the fact that the real bridge has fallen into a chasm, hoping that the Roadrunner will run off the end and be killed. Instead the Roadrunner runs into the painting and contin- ues along the nonexistent bridge. But Wile E., attempting to follow, plum- mets into space. In another episode, he paints a tunnel onto a rock face, hoping that the Roadrunner will run into it and knock himself unconscious. Instead, the Roadrunner runs through the painted tunnel. When Wile E. tries to follow, he smacks himself flat against its surface. It is as if the act of paint- ing a thing has made it real enough to bear the weight of the Roadrunner but not its author, in the same way that some traditions holds that telling a story may give it a life of its own. 1 In other variations on the false road, a truck co- mes out of the tunnel and flattens the coyote, or a train roars down the painted trestle and runs him over. The story has opened the road between our world and some other one, and now new things may come down it.2 The Coyote of legend has begun to make a magical realist appearance in late twentieth-century fiction. In Ursula K. Le Guin's novelette, "Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight?" Coyote, seen in a rare female incar- nation, takes a lost human child into the dream-time world of the animals. The child, Gal, waking from a desert plane crash which has blinded her in one eye and killed the pilot taking her to her father, finds a coyote standing over her, talking to her. She follows it and soon begins to see the coyote as a woman with yellow-gray hair. Coyote Mother takes Gal into the desert where the animal people live and gives her the sight to see them as people and not creatures. They bestow on her an eye made of pine gum, parallel to a number of Coyote tales in which new eyes are made in this fashion, and per- haps it is this eye which lends her new vision. Chickadee becomes a round little woman with a black cap on her head; Horned Toad Child a pale, soli- tary playmate; Rattler a yellow-eyed dancer in a diamond-patterned cloak. In return, each animal sees Gal as a young member of his or her own particular species. They are quite aware that she is not. That is just that way that vision works, they tell her. To them, the places that humans inhabit appear as holes in the landscape, full of a white mist, inhabited by things unknowable. Coyote's maternal instincts are no better than one would expect: her house is filthy and full of fleas, and she has sex with anyone, including her sons from previous litters (advising Gal not to have boys if she can help it). But she protects Gal, after her fashion, and feeds her, and when the child be- gins to yearn for the human people who are her own, Coyote goes with her. Coyote can see between the worlds, move between them, into the human places and out again, although often enough with a shotgun blast at her tail. In the Arts 67</page><page sequence="5">When Coyote Leaves the Res: On the edges of the human world, Gal's vision blinks between that of a hu- man child and the sight of the animal people, but Coyote sees clearly. She just doesn't have any sense. Coyote never does. She finds the poisoned car- cass of a lamb and, while Gal warns her not to, bolts down the bait, and dies in agony. It is Grandmother Spider who sends Gal back to the human world, telling her not to worry about Coyote. Coyote gets killed all the time, she says. The Coyote of Christopher Moore's novel Coyote Blue personifies the protagonist Sam Hunter's need to go home to the country of his birth and be- come himself again. But because he is Coyote and not somebody's fairy god- mother, his appearances are marked by upheaval and outrage. His first manifestation gets Sam thrown out of his condominium complex for harbor- ing an illegal "dog." In this excerpt, the security chief, Spagnola, reads Sam his log book: "Nine A.M.: Mrs. Feldstein calls to report that a wolf has just urinated on her wisterias. I ignored that one. Nine oh-five: Mrs. Feldstein reports that the wolf is forcibly having sex with her Persian cat. I went on that call myself, just to see it. Nine ten: Mrs. Feldstein reports that the wolf ate the Persian after having his way with it. There was some blood and fur on her walk when I got there, but no wolf. " "Is this thing a wolf?" Sam asked. "I don't think so. I've only seen it from below your deck. It has the right coloring for a coyote, but it's too damn big. . . . Okay. Ten fourteen: Mrs. Narada reports that her cat has been at- tacked by a large dog. Now I send all the boys out looking, but they don't find anything until eleven. Then one of them calls in that a big dog has just bitten holes in the tires on his golf cart and run off. Eleven thirty: Dr. Epstein makes his first lost-nap call: dog howling. Eleven thirty-five: Mrs. Norcross is putting the kids out on the deck for some burgers when a big dog jumps over the rail, eats the burgers, growls at the kids, runs off. First mention of lawsuits." "Kids? We've got her right there," Sam said. "Kids aren't allowed. " "Her grandkids are visiting from Michigan. She filed the proper papers." Spagnola took a deep breath and started into the log again. "Eleven forty-one: large dog craps in Dr. Yamata's Aston Martin. Twelve oh-three: dog eats two, count 'em, two of Mrs. Wittingham's Siamese cats. She just lost her husband last week; this sort of put her over the edge. We had to call Dr. Yamata in off the putting green to give her a sedative. The per- sonal-injury lawyer in the unit next to hers was home for lunch and he came over to help. " (48-49) 68 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="6">Amanda Cockrell Coyote's appetites are always ravenous and his sexuality is not subtle. In Coyote stories, the penis is an organ capable of stretching to enormous length and is detachable to boot. There are numerous tales in which Coyote seduces females of all species, often borrowing someone else's penis to do so or taking off his own while pretending to be a woman. In one scene of Coy- ote Blue he becomes female and hands Sam his penis to hold. But with the exception of Le Guin's story, this transformation is generally a matter of trickery, and he reverts to his male persona.3 The issue of why Coyote is nearly always male is interesting. Hyde sug- gests that it may be because his creativity is non-procreative. "It should be noted that the trickster's fabled sex drive rarely leads to any offspring. Tricksters do not make new life, they rearrange that which is already at hand" (341). 4 So his sexuality serves another purpose, perhaps the same as that of fertility deities. He does not reproduce himself, but encourages others to do so. In addition he offers the chance to make trouble, and thus change, into the bargain. Hyde cites another story involving a transvestite marriage and a false vulva made of elk liver (221). 5 Certainly the exploding love affair is a Coyote gift. Thomas Moore says that "[i]t is the nature of sex, maybe its purpose, to blast some holes in our thinking, our planning, our moralisms - sex is life in all its boldness" (28). As Hyde suggests, Coyote is neither the muscle-bound hero nor the as- cetic male who "develops the muscles of self-restraint" (342). Like Richard Farina's "Hard-Loving Loser," he is "the schoolyard failure who never kept his cool, went to flicks alone, and lost out all around, or nearly. Catching what he could, he practiced subtler arts than surfing, and mothers wondered why their daughters smiled" (album notes). Hyde calls him "the lithe and small-bodied escape artist, [who] doesn't win the way the big guys do, but [who] doesn't suffer the way they do either, and [who] enjoys pleasures they find too risky" (342). In twentieth-century terms, his sexual role is that of that perennial seducer of the female heart, the Bad Boy. Yet because Trickster is defined by his duality, the other end of the Coy- ote character scale is that of world creator, preserver. In Moore's novel, Coyote proves to be the brother of Anubis, dog-headed god of the Egyptian underworld, not too far a departure from the legends which make him brother of Wolf. His purpose is to see that someone tells his stories and therefore keeps his people alive. Like Le Guin's Coyote, this one too dies at the end of the novel, this time to rescue a child who will be his next story- teller. Again we are given the clear hint that he will not stay dead. Coyote figures as the creator of the world in a number of tales, and in Thomas King's novel Green Grass, Running Water, the origins of the Chris- tian God are traced to one of Coyote's dreams, which just got a little out of hand: So, that Coyote is dreaming and pretty soon, one of those dreams In the Arts 69</page><page sequence="7">When Coyote Leaves the Res: gets loose and runs around. Makes a lot of noise. Hooray, says that silly Dream, Coyote dream. I'm in charge of the world. . . . "No," says Coyote. "You can't be Coyote. But you can be a dog. * Are dogs smart? says that Dream. "You bet," says Coyote. "Dogs are good. They are al- most as good as Coyote. " Okay, says that Dream. I can do that. But when the Coyote Dream thinks about being a dog, it gets everything mixed up. It gets everything backwards.... I am god, says that Dog Dream. "Isn't that cute," says Coyote. "That Dog Dream is a contrary. That Dog Dream has everything backward." But why am I little god? shouts that god. "Not so loud, " says Coyote. "You're hurting my ears. " I don't want to be a little god, says that god. I want to be a big god! "What a noise," says Coyote. "This dog has no man- ners." Big one! "Okay, okay," says Coyote. "Just stop shouting." There, says that god. That's better. "Now you've done it," I says. "Everything's under control," says Coyote. "Don't panic." (1-3) Here Coyote is portrayed as both creator and reshaper, of the world and of human destinies. He travels with four old Indians who appear periodically to "fix the world," including rearranging old John Wayne movies so that the Indians win. Their fix is accompanied each time by a retelling of the world's origins, and, because Coyote can never resist dancing and singing just a lit- tle, some overwhelming natural disaster. Under their influence, a Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony gathers in a number of tribal members whose subcon- scious, like Sam Hunter's, knows they need to be there, whatever their con- scious inclinations. And in a wry comment on the retelling of an already altered history, their voyage works its way through a 448-page pun on Co- lumbus's discovery of a land previously quite adequately discovered by its inhabitants, involving a Nissan, a Pinto, and a Karmann-Ghia. Similarly, the Coyote who appears in Charles de Lint's tales of urban fantasy, The Ivory and the Horn, inhabits those who feel the need to tell their 70 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="8">Amanda Cockrell story and the stories of their tribe and nation. Often enough it is under the in- fluence of whiskey and desperation, getting drunk and picking a fight with a lamppost, too long gone from the reservation into a bleak city where things were supposed to be better and are not. But this Coyote makes a drum and a dancing circle and a fire, and in a while he has made community of the scat- tered vagrants and hookers and drunks who live on the tarnished edge of the city. And after he is killed in a knife fight in jail, the community is still there. Coyote makes trouble, but he made the world to begin with, and so he lives in the people of his creation.6 Coyote appears in multiple guises (again including that of God) in John P. Spivey's 1997 poem, "Coyote Genesis." Here he is first God, then Coy- ote, then the Snake, playing all roles interchangeably. In this account, God, or "whatever it [is]", gets bored: So whatever it was became a brown coyote, Stopped for a moment to appreciate his form reflected In a nearby puddle, Farted twice, Licked his balls, then told the newcomers, "Don't eat that fruit," and trotted off. He then becomes enamored of his own penis, which becomes an emerald green snake, tells them to go ahead and eat the fruit, and then watches the re- sults. Here and in King's novel, Coyote crosses into Christian mythology as easily as he absorbed the Egyptians' Anubis. Old Man Coyote is never still. Duality is in his nature. Gerald Hausman calls his role that of "universal, creator, destroyer, rebuilder" (xix). Joseph Campbell assigns his power to the figure of the shaman, the free-lance mys- tic, more dangerous than members of the more orderly priesthoods (275). C. G. Jung calls him "an old river-bed in which water still flows" and assigns him the role of the collective "shadow," both bestial and divine, that human ability to achieve glory and ignominy simultaneously, knowledge of which "breaks up under the impact of civilization, leaving traces in folklore which are difficult to recognize" (142). (If we look, we may find him in the pyra- mid scheme, presidential sex scandals, and advertising.) Both the trickster and the tricked, both life and death, bringer of gifts and exploding cigars, he is the shape-shifter, the agent and personification of change. Neither good nor evil, he is simply that which is. According to Jung, "[although he is not really evil, he does the most atrocious things from sheer unconsciousness ..." (144) That ambiguous aspect makes him a difficult character for children's au- thors. Most mainstream picture books in which Coyote appears are retellings In the Arts 71</page><page sequence="9">When Coyote Leaves the Res: of traditional Native American tales, unfortunately simplified. Lost is the ambiguity of the mythological archetype. And lost is his role as world cre- ator. His crudity, his sexual appetite, his vulgar behavior are all tidied up in the way that European fairy tales have been tidied. He is a clean coyote. Nor- man Williamson has suggested that adaptations of Native American stories by the dominant culture can only be successful (from the dominant culture's point of view) if they become "tales" which meet the criteria of the written literature of that culture (70). As Perry Nodelman argues, although many adults may laugh about vulgar subjects, and even accept their children's laughter, What they do not accept is the presence of such laughter within the narrow confines of children's literature. The relative silence of children's literature about such subjects is most significant simply because it reveals the often huge gulf between childhood as de- picted in children's literature and the lives and interests of real children.... elimination has been eliminated, all evidence of animality and mutability has been eliminated, in order to satisfy an adult nostalgia for a supposed time of freedom from pain and limi- tation, a time of purity and innocence that never was (108). The sexual component of many unadulterated Coyote stories caused the first white people who heard them to label them as pagan and evil (Toelken, 208), which is a short step from equating the trickster with the devil. And certainly the nostalgia of which Nodelman speaks leaves little room for the uncom- fortable ambiguity of polytheism which Hyde claims a trickster tale requires (9-10). In the picture book And Me, Coyote! by Betty Baker, rather than creating the world, he only helps World Maker to do so. When it is time to create man, all the animals try, each one attempting to make the man like itself, and succeed only in making a conglomerate creature that is ridiculous and use- less. Then World Maker does it properly. This version strips its Miwok orig- inal (Dobie 267-269) of Coyote's creator role in favor of the vaguely defined World Maker, whom the illustrations portray as looking like man, only larger, much like the Old Testament God. Tom Pohrt's picture book Coyote Goes Walking is closer to the mythological Coyote. Here he remakes the world after a first failed world, tries to imitate the woodpecker to his embar- rassment and discomfiture, and insults the spirit of Bull Buffalo through sheer bad manners. But there is very little of the trickster's ingenuity here. Closest perhaps is Jon Scieszka's The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, by A. Wolf, in which the Wolf explains how it was all just a mistake - he sneezed and that straw house fell down, and that poor pig was killed, and, well you can't just leave food lying around, can you? That's wasteful. This 72 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="10">Amanda Cockrell sounds like the true Coyote, even in this lupine guise. He is hungry, not be- nevolent, ambiguous in his intentions, prone to brag about his cleverness, and scornful of the pigs' stupidity. Whatever Scieszka's original intentions, he has achieved a true Coyote story.7 The Trickster element is the theme of Andre Norton's young adult book Fur Magic, and it too, has a contemporary setting, although she is less suc- cessful than Le Guin, King or Moore in her attempt to fit the wild world of Coyote into the world of Christian understanding, in which only one true god is allowed. Norton personifies Coyote as the Changer, the force which "turns the world over," ending the rule of animals and beginning the rule of man. But Norton both gives this transformation the flavor of original sin - the animal people were truer, simpler, better - and at the same time por- trays them as anthropomorphic in their wars, their tribes and alliances. Of the Changer, the boy Cory is first told, "He never wanted things to be the same. It was in him to change them around." Left alone in the country- side, Cory meets the old Indian Black Elk, who speaks with an unfortunate movie-Indian grammar, but is ancient and powerful, full of knowledge of the old ways. For an inadvertent sin, Black Elk changes Cory into a beaver, to learn the ways of the animal people in the time before the world turned over. In the course of his adventures, the beaver Cory must battle the Changer himself, a man/coyote to whom Norton has given green eyes as long as he stays in his half-human shape. The Changer is busily making a man from clay and making a bad job of it. He cannot make the clay take the right form and only achieves a properly molded man when Cory appears to serve as his model. Even then the head is only a ball, not a true human head. This Coyote is evil, and his intent is to enslave mankind to the animal people and to his own ends. He is thwarted in his attempt when Cory calls down the Thunder- bird, who imposes on the Changer Coyote the will of what he calls The One Above - the only power great enough to create man. The Changer Coyote is left on his knees before the power of The One Above; and defeated, he loses all human aspect, becoming only a "great yellow-white beast who stood there. It was all animal, and the yellow eyes, the teeth from which his snarling lips curled away, promised only death" (169). We note here that, having lost all his human attributes, the Changer now has the coyote's prop- erly yellow eyes. But this beast cannot cross the running water of the stream in which Cory hides, and so from its bank he promises Cory the things he wants most - return to his own form - and then threatens what he most fears - entrapment in the beaver form. Cory wins by shoving the Changer's medicine bundle into the sunlight, where the sun's rays destroy it and trans- form Cory to his own shape again. Here Norton, like Baker, takes away Coyote's status as creator of man- kind and gives it to The One Above, the only true god,8 couching Cory's vic- In the Arts 73</page><page sequence="11">When Coyote Leaves the Res: tory in the Christian symbolism of running water and sunlight. In doing so, Coyote trades his original role for that of a lesser avatar of Satan the tempter. This Christian overlay leaves us without true understanding of the nature of Coyote, who is not evil but only the agent of change; as Hyde says, not immoral but amoral (10). It is mostly in the Coyote of the adult authors, except that of Spiritwalk, that he retains his original role as the incarnation of the wild lands, and thus his value to us. He is not a comfortable deity, which may have influenced Norton's urge to ally him with the forces of evil. But he is something we need. He does not fall in love, but he is powerfully sexual, another uncom- fortable trait which Norton, like Williamson's adapters and authors of folk tale retellings for younger children, chooses to ignore. He encourages pro- creation, the replenishment of the earth. He is Life, which, of course, con- tains Death. An archetypal trickster, he is the North American equivalent of Shiva, Lord of the Dance and balancer of the world. Both creator and de- stroyer, he thus fills a primal niche in our mythological subconscious, and it should not surprise us that, like Canis latrans, we cannot make him go away. Notes 1 In one story Coyote creates the animals merely by naming them (Erdoes &amp; Ortiz, 90). 2 In an episode of The Simpsons, Homer Simpson goes to a chili cook-off and eats "Guatemalan insanity peppers," which appear to be a thinly disguised, and more politically and socially acceptable, substitute for peyote. The effect might best be described as Wile E. Coyote meets Carlos Casteneda. Homer finds himself trans- ported to a surrealistic Southwest, where Coyote materializes to be his spirit guide. Find your true desire, Coyote tells him. When Homer asks if he should get rid of all his possessions, Coyote says, "Oh, no, you should get more of them," and bites him. In a bow to Looney Tunes, Homer's vision ends with being run over by a "ghost train" that materializes out of nowhere. 3 Coyote dons the guise which serves him. He also appears twice at crucial mo- ments in Coyote Blue as a fat, white vacuum cleaner salesman. 4 There are a few tales in which Coyote has children. Hyde cites a Nez Percé story in which Coyote goes to the land of the dead to look for his daughter (83); in the Kwakiutl story " Always-Living-at-the-Coast," he marries and has a son (Erdoes and Ortiz, 362); and Dobie records a Zuni tale in which he has a wife and many pups (297). 5 Joseph Campbell cites a story in which Coyote turns into a girl and actually does becomes pregnant (417). 6 Coyote as he appears in de Lint's long novel Spiritwalk is less successful than Le Guin's or Moore's or King's Coyote or de Lint's Coyote of "Coyote Stories." In 74 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="12">Amanda Cockrell Spiritwalk , he is a coyote-headed man, Whiskey Jack, one incarnation of the force who is Old Man Coyote, Anansi the Spider, Robin Goodfellow, and multiple other tricksters from world mythology. But de Lint endows his world of urban fantasy with so much overlapping magic that any real sense of it is lost. In this book every- one seems to have powers; enchanted talismans and magical portals litter the streets; goblins and elves sit under every bush. The heroine goes on study vacations in paral- lel dimensions with her tame Druidic bard. With this much magic floating about there is very little sense of wonder each time it appears, and Coyote becomes so di- luted that he even falls in love and pontificates about learning from one's mistakes. At that point he ceases to be Trickster. When the Bad Boy is domesticated, marries and settles down, we don't hear from him again. As Hyde says, "awakened con- science is the potential end of the narrative" (220-221). 7 Susan Lowell's The Three Little Javalinas is a straightforward retelling, given a Southwestern setting and Southwestern substitutions for pigs and wolf. Here Coy- ote is credited with "magic" that doesn't always work, but otherwise he is the tradi- tional wolf of the original. 8 Most Native American traditions include the idea of a "Great Mystery Spirit" (one of a number of awkward and largely inaccurate translations for a concept of God), who is a force above all others, an ultimate creator. But they are rarely vain enough to insist that only this All-Powerful could create humans or the world as we know it. That is a task more often left to Coyote or other lesser avatars.
