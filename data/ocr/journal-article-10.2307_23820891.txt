I would like to thank all those who had a part to play in the formation of this paper; in particular Dr Yael Navaro-Yashin, Dr Kathleen Richardson and my director of studies, Dr Clarissa de Waal, for their invaluable comments. I am also greatly indebted to my supervisor, Professor Marilyn Strathern, whose exceptional support and encouragement always illuminated new perspectives yet to be explored. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the Newnham College Travel Bursary and the Cambridge European Trust Scholarship, without which my fieldwork would not have been possible. My greatest thanks, however, go to those keepers, researchers, volunteers and residents (human and nonhuman) at Fundacid Mona, with whom I shared six fascinating, challenging and life-changing weeks in the late summer and mid winter of 2007. You taught me so much, and I will always be grateful for the kindness and generosity you showed me. Thank you for putting up with my unceasing note-takings and my endless questions! I hope I have managed to portray even a fraction of your hard work, your philosophising, your struggles, and your respect for and dedication to one another.

I am held there with a somatic awareness of which I am largely oblivious. But this biological-evolutionary fact isn't what reassures me as I stretch higher to affix the last screw through the worn out hosepipe above. I feel reassured because I have seen this position safely assumed dozens of times in the past few weeks by those who live out their lives in this enclosure. As I half swing, half jump down to the rough ground where my bound and docile feet spend most of their time, I test the other end of the hose to make sure it is secure enough to be able to take all of the force Bongo or Juanito will undoubtedly subject it to. As I rock the hosepipe, using my full body weight, I cannot help but feel a sense of joy and power at the effect I am having on my environment; I am causing the whole 3x12m hosepipe climbing frame, which the volunteers and I have been building since dawn, to shudder and shake with a slight whooshing sound as it sways through the air. As I identify this feeling within myself, I am certain that it must resemble how Marco or Charly experience their displays - shaking the structures around them and deafening their neighbours as they drag boxes or crates along the floor behind them - an excitement about their power in the world, and their ability to move things bigger than themselves. My attention shifts as another volunteer lip-sputters2 in my direction, and indicates the head keeper, who is approaching to lock the enclosure doors. The volunteer inclines his head in a nod, and I respond with a similar movement - we agree the job is done. We pick up our tools and all remnants of what belongs to the Outside. We are just in time; the inhabitants are about to come tumbling out of their jaulas,3 and the ground on which we walk will soon be transformed into their space. We slip through the gates; returning to our spaces, to watch them through the boundary-marking wire-mesh. * * * * * An abnormal vocalisation of captive chimpanzees used to attract another's attention (it is often directed at humans, as a request for food or an object of interest).

The buzzing reverberation of the electric fence, which has a large plaque warning visitors that there are animates peligrosos (dangerous animals)4 within, signals the absolute seal of the gate,, and the subsequent demarcation of a boundary, as the keepers heave open the jaula doors and begin to coax and cajole the inhabitants within. Toto, a Nigerian male aged fifty-two, and head of the family group, is the first to exit. He pauses by the door to greet each member as they enter the outside enclosure, waiting as the more stubborn youngsters refuse - despite considerable coaxing from the keepers - to leave their straw-bedded sleeping quarters. Eventually the keepers request that Toto go inside to fetch the younger chimps, and without hesitation he does so, hooting in response to the youngsters' obstinate screams. Once everyone has been greeted by Toto and is making their way around the enclosure - finding the tomatoes, newly-boiled potatoes, cucumbers, lettuces, peppers and onions which have been scattered and carefully hidden by the volunteers earlier that morning - Toto meticulously walks the boundary of the enclosure, as the head keeper did just minutes before, checking, so it seems, as did the head keeper, that inside is inside and outside is outside - that boundaries have not been crossed and that there is no pollution, and no danger. But of course, I tell myself (suddenly now fully embodied behind this boundary and resituated within my 'western ontological frameworks'), I can have no idea what Toto is thinking. He is, after all, Pan troglodytes vellerosus, and I, Homo sapiens sapiens, although also classified and quantified as a 'Great Ape', am supposedly something distinctly different, something unique, elevated and cognitively far advanced - 'Man'. Nonetheless, ironically, what a chimpanzee thinks Despite their intimate knowledge of the chimpanzees' temperaments, and their amicable relationships, Keepers always maintained that animals are by nature unpredictable and potentially dangerous, particularly if encountered on the 'Outside'. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="6">6 Lys Alcayna-Stevens and feels is beyond these cognitive capacities. In fact, throughout much of Western Enlightenment discourse, the chimpanzee could just as easily have been said not to think or feel at all. Why, then, do I recall that just minutes before, my perspective was completely different? In inhabiting their affective spaces and touching their food, in embodying their movements and imagining their reactions, it felt as though I could clearly understand the mind and perspective of a chimpanzee. I would like to pause here on the concept of 'perspective'. Understanding the world from another's point of view is central to anthropological enquiry. However, 'point of view' does not entirely cover the experience I am describing here. Mol argues that while perspectivalism broke away from a monopolistic version of truth, it did not break away from 'pluralism' by multiplying reality. "There they are' she asserts, 'mutually exclusive perspectives, discrete, existing side by side, in a transparent space. While in the centre the object of the many gazes and glances remains singular, intangible, untouched' (Mol 1999: 76). Viveiros de Castro (1998), however, seeks to transcend Western ontological perspectivalism, by introducing Amerindian perspectivism, which assumes multiple worlds inseparable from bodies and perspectives. Throughout this paper, I take inspiration from this perspectivism, as described by Viveiros de Castro, in order to explore the multiple and shifting perspectives at the sanctuary. Amerindian perspectivism refers to the way humans and animals see both themselves and one another, and therefore illuminates their apprehension of the world around them. Viveiros de Castro (1998: 470) summarises this in a passage which elegantly interweaves idioms of nature and culture: animals and spirits see themselves as humans: they perceive themselves as (or become) anthropomorphic beings when they are in their own houses or villages and they experience their own habits and characteristics in the form of culture - they see their food as human food (jaguars see blood as manioc beer, vultures see the maggots in rotting meat as grilled fish, etc.), they see their bodily attributes (fur, feathers, claws, beaks etc.) as body decorations or cultural instruments, they see their social system as organized in the same way as human institutions are (with chiefs, shamans, ceremonies, exogamous moieties, etc.) Such an approach to Amerindian ontology proposes a radical alternative to the perspectival assertion that the world is composed of neutral objects. Law argues, following Mol, that 'we are not dealing with different and possibly flawed perspectives on the same object' (2004: 55) Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="7">In the Shadow of Man 7 but with entirely different multiple realities. I aim to engage with contemporary anthropological theories and debates which seek to examine these realities or 'subject worlds' (cf. Ingold 2000), and which do not presuppose a world consisting of human agents and determinable 'objects-in-themselves', whose essential qualities are given 'without regard to their positioning and involvement within wider fields of relations' (Ingold 2000: 96). Through an engagement with approaches which acknowledge non-human actors and explore multiplicity, I will be able to offer a more nuanced insight into an ethnographic context in which the chimpanzees concerned are all but passive objects in a human society. Is 'The Social' always Conspecific? It goes without saying that human society has formed the central focus of British social anthropology. Nonetheless, in exploring the divergences of the social and biological sciences, Ingold asks what kind of answers anthropologists might give to the question, 'what is a social relationship?' (1989: 496). He argues that if such a definition were applicable to non-human groups, then their sociality might well benefit from more 'humanistic analyses'. This is certainly a valid point, and many primate field studies have radically changed the outlooks and methodologies of behavioural sciences through such approaches, for example Goodall's 1960s fieldwork amongst the chimpanzees of Gombe Stream, Tanzania. However, I would like to suggest that employing such analyses overlooks the meanings which have been attributed to 'the social' and 'society' in much of the social sciences. The concept 'society' arguably has its roots in the work of the eminent French sociologist Durkheim. For Durkheim, society was a force essentially external to human individuals, guiding and coercing them; its effects could be directly observed through an examination of social facts. Durkheim's sociology expanded through British social anthropology with the work of the early C20th structural-functionalists, who focused on questions of hierarchy, 'society' and social structure. Such concerns can subsequently be found in many animal behaviour studies. Most notably, the first Euro American primatologist to conduct field studies, DeVore (1962 in Riley 2006), was a graduate student of social anthropology who was heavily influenced by the ethnographic method and social theory of Radcliffe Brown. It would appear, therefore, that many of the assumptions conducive to a 'humanistic analysis' have already penetrated studies of animal behaviour. Furthermore, the 'society' expounded by Durkheim Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="8">8 Lys Alcayna-Stevens and Radcliffe-Brown, while comparable to that of sociobiology, in which 'society [is] a group of individuals belonging to the same species and organized in a cooperative manner' (Wilson 1978 in Ingold 1989: 497), is far removed from contemporary debates concerning 'the social' in anthropology and beyond. Here, I take my cue from Latour (2002) who, in heralding Tarde as the forefather of actor-network theory, asks us instead: how might anthropologists and sociologists - and by extension, primatologists - have understood 'the social' had Tarde retained prominence over the 'younger, less successful upstart' Durkheim (Latour 2002: 117)? He criticises Durkheim's 'society' for being premised on the human. According to Tarde, it is not that 'we should treat social facts as things', but that 'all things are society' (Latour 2002: 120). Latour suggests that the nature/culture and human/nonhuman divides are irrelevant for understanding the world of interactions and associations. In order to fully explore the complexities of the relationships at the sanctuary, I will attempt, therefore, to ask what an interspecific social might look like. What kind of communication/understanding is possible across species boundaries? What is the nature of this understanding (and of these boundaries)? I will build on the work of ethologist and semioticist, von Uexkiill (1957; 1982a), and his concept of the 'subjective universe', or Umwelt, in order to explore the complexity and interconnection of bodies, worlds and relationships. Is it possible to displace oneself into the world of another when surrounded by objects which normally give meaning to that world? After all, as a participant in the chimpanzees' enclosure, wasn't it easier to see myself as (or to be?) a chimp, than once I had stepped outside and become an observer, looking in? The Proliferation of Networks AND of Boundaries Throughout my fieldwork, I was very interested in how the keepers and volunteers experienced and perceived their relationships with the chimpanzees, and how they conceived of the chimpanzees themselves, and of their perspectives. It was clear that the understanding I felt within the enclosure, and on occasion when meeting the eye of a curious, playful or frightened chimpanzee, was also shared by those who worked at the sanctuary every day. Nonetheless, the empathy we felt was not easily explained. For example, in asking one of the volunteer keepers how she knew that it was unpleasant for Julio (a large male who was in quarantine due Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="9">In the Shadow of Man 9 to illness) to be cramped in the walkway of the Machos'5 enclosure, or how she created new enrichment activities which she knew the chimpanzees would enjoy, she explained that she imagined how it would feel to be in their place and to experience things from their point of view. This was not long after she had told me that it was not only impossible to see from another species' or another culture's perspective, but that it was impossible to see from another individual's perspective. Nonetheless, she admitted, this was not an assumption with which she worked all of the time. Why did a keeper empathise to the point of tears every time she saw the video of Pancho's outstretched hand emerging between the bars after eight years of solitary confinement? And why did she feel so overwhelmed when the video subsequently followed the chimps making their 'happy noises' as they were released for the first time into the large, lush open space of the enclosure? Why did Tico (an aggressive male undergoing 'socialisation') - perpetually curled inactively beneath his blanket - light up at the sound of volunteer keeper Darren's voice? Why did the circus trainer who owned Sara and Nico argue that the sanctuary were 'taking his children away' when the infant chimpanzees were finally confiscated? Why did a young female chimpanzee who had been locked in a broken lorry for five years with the sole purpose of breeding, offer part of her meagre portion of bread and milk to the WSPA officer6 sitting nearest her, when she realised that the officer had not been given anything to eat? Furthermore, with so much affection and empathy, how could the central pre-occupation of the sanctuary be to separate human and chimpanzee, and to 'dehumanise' the chimps? Viveiros de Castro (1998: 470) argues that 'the flourishing industry of criticisms of the Westernizing character of all dualisms has called for the abandonment of our conceptually dichotomous heritage', but that 'alternatives have not gone beyond the stage of wishful unthinking'. In looking once more at those fragments which bear 'the stamp of our age and geography' (Foucault 2001), I suggest that 'modern' and 'Western' ontology is often viewed in a way which is too bounded and reified. In doing so, I wish to go beyond Latour's (1993) affirmation that 'we have Los Machos means 'the males': four adult males are separated from la Familia (a group of youngsters headed by an old male and female) by an electric fence though they can communicate. WSPA is the World Society for the Protection of Animals. They are currently very active in Spain. The WSPA worked closely with the sanctuary during its initial rescue of six male chimpanzees from a circus trainer in Valencia, helped to design the chimps' main outdoor enclosure and covered all the construction costs. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="10">10 Lys Alcayna-Stevens never been modern' in order to suggest that daily understanding and discourse at the sanctuary (and perhaps beyond) requires simultaneity of modern and non-modern thought: the proliferation of networks AND of boundaries; of perspectivism AND perspectivalism. The Primate Order of Things Surely Descartes never saw an ape. - Carl Linnaeus; Systema Naturae Into the Field This section seeks to introduce the sanctuary and to explore the Western ontological frameworks in which it situates itself, and thereby the world and discourses of which it is a part. In particular, I will explore the ambiguous status of primates, and specifically Great Apes in Western conceptions of humanity. These concepts are of relevance to the sanctuary not only because they shape the ontologies of the research institutions, conservation organisations, and government legislation with which it is in dialogue. They are also significant because many of the keepers and researchers, themselves, have a background in the biological and social sciences in which these discourses have been formed and debated. The sanctuary was founded in the spring of the third millennium. It grew out of the work of two English residents of Catalonia, who had first become aware of the plight of 'beach chimps' and the vast trafficking of West African fauna, when, in 1978, they bought a young female chimpanzee from a pet shop in Barcelona. The couple were alarmed by the cruelty with which the exploited chimpanzees were treated, as well as the decimating effects on wild populations (mothers and siblings are often killed in the process of capturing baby chimpanzees). The adverse publicity brought about through their campaigning was a significant threat to Spain's vital tourist industry. Coupled with the pressure of international politics when Spain successfully applied for membership of the EEC in 1986 (and was thus obliged to adhere to CITES [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species] regulations) primate welfare in Spain has now greatly improved - so much so that since February 2007, the Balearic Parliament has approved a proposition to support the legal recognition of nonhuman apes. The role of IPPL representative was taken up in the late 1990s by the veterinarian who had conducted examinations on a large majority of the rescued chimpanzees before they were repatriated to various Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="11">In the Shadow of Man 11 sanctuaries in western Africa. The Catalonian sanctuary itself stands on ground donated by the local ayuntamiento (district council). It is not an isolated unit, but is sustained by its networks, which extend far beyond its immediate borders and into the homes of those who join its cause across Spain and much of Europe. These networks also encompass those who provide monetary support by 'adopting' a chimpanzee (the sanctuary currently has over four hundred padrinos), the local people who lend their time to help with building, gardening and maintenance, local farmers who donate fruit, vegetables and fencing materials, the local fire service who donate worn-out hoses once the wildfire season has passed, as well as companies and organisations who help fund projects, research, equipment, and who donate vaccines. One volunteer also told me proudly that where tourists could previously be found with a photo of themselves in which they are holding a dressed-up baby chimp, they can now be seen with one of the sanctuary's leaflets in their back-pocket instead. Communal meals at the sanctuary always involve a colourful mix of people: from six-month volunteers to full-time researchers and keepers, to academic visitors and 'working weekenders'.7 Such a varied international community means that no bounded image of sanctuary ontology can be portrayed. Furthermore, I hope to demonstrate that although the sanctuary is a nexus of Western ontologies and discourses, there is a great flexibility with which they are deployed, with many differing perspectives and ontologies in play - some of which would not typically be classed 'western' at all. Philosophical Preliminaries Neither is the international community of the sanctuary limited to the genus Homo. The media folder in the Education and Research Centre is full of newspaper clippings in French, German, English and Dutch, in which countries say farewell to 'their' chimpanzees. The reason it took the sanctuary so long to transfer Nigerian-born Toto, for example, is that the German public did not want to see their oldest chimpanzee leave Berlin zoo. Similarly, France has retained a small portion of cultural ownership over 19-year old male, Victor, who will be financially supported at the sanctuary for the rest of his life by the French NGO 'One Voice'. Many people pay for the privilege of working alongside the Keepers, and having the chance to get close to the chimpanzees for a couple of days. These people were often referred to as 'Los Working'. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="12">12 Lys Alcayna-Stevens I will briefly outline the 'philosophy' of the sanctuary, as it was described to me by the founder and several of the earliest researchers and volunteers. These three precepts are central to my discussion of discourse and practice in the sanctuary: LIMITED INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTION ( I ) No physical human chimpanzee contact, and interspecies communication limited SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT (II) The sanctuary does not only seek to rescue chimpanzees, but to allow them room to flourish through social integration RESEARCH &amp; EDUCATION (III ) To make people conscious through education: in particular 'the Visit' Keepers emphasised the troubled personal histories of the chimpanzees as reason for their separation from humans. In most of these cases, the boundaries which 'should' have been maintained were blurred, and the chimpanzees had been forced to live lives in-between: as circus acts, or for roles in adverts or television shows, where they had been neither chimp nor human, but rather, a sort of matter out of place (Douglas 1966). I explore below how these oppositions may have arisen in a genealogy of western ontologies, and why it might be conceived as dangerous for such opposites to mix, thereby contaminating 'natural' essences. This will later be opposed with the idea that a 'correct' social environment can shape these natural essences into a 'correct' being. Discourses of Humanity: is Animal to Man as Nature is to Culture? Taking inspiration from Levi-Strauss' (1976) observation that for 'savages' humanity ceases at the boundary of the group, I seek to demonstrate that distinctions between 'man' and 'animal', and subsequently 'culture' and 'nature', are essentially debates about 'us' and 'them' - they help us address the question of who will be granted humanity and therefore enjoy the same rights and freedoms as we afford our own kind (although this category itself is not static). Furthermore, I follow Haraway, who, building on Said (1978), argues that 'simian orientalism' displays the Western imagination of the origin of sociality itself and is 'about the construction of the self from the raw material of the other, the appropriation of nature in the production of culture, the ripening of the human from the soil of the animal' (1989: 11). I will briefly explore how 'we' are constructed in relation to 'them', and therefore remain in many ways entangled: hybrid. To begin, one might ask how a distinction between man and animal has been conceived and explained. Cartesian philosophy holds Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="13">In the Shadow of Man 13 that man is a divine being with a soul, while animals are essentially automata mechanica. Descartes' assumptions about the unbridgeable gap between man and animal have been increasingly challenged by science and philosophy (cf. Singer &amp; Regan 1976). Nonetheless, while contemporary western academics grapple with the attribution of minds and emotions to nonhuman animals (e.g. Goodall 1990: 13), as Western men and women it is likely that such a distinction has never been a problem; many of these people will have attributed personalities, wishes, fears, decisions, emotions and thoughts - without a second thought of their own - to their companion species throughout their lives. This 'doublethink' (Orwell 2000: 35), or simultaneity of modern and nonmodern thought, recurs throughout Western conceptions of dualisms and their dissolution. As Ingold notes, 'for those of us reared in the tradition of Western thought, 'human' and 'animal' are terms rich in association, fraught with ambiguity, and heavily laden with both intellectual and emotional bias' (1994:14). Animality has been perceived as the opposite of humanity. At times it has been characterised by a deficiency in all things which make 'us' uniquely human: including language, reason, intellect, empathy, culture and creativity. Alternatively, phylogeny is seen to recapitulate ontogeny, and animals are conceived of as 'almost human'; as primitive and underdeveloped. Ingold (1994) recalls those experiments in the cognitive sciences which compare human infant and chimpanzee behaviour. He notes that while we argue that chimps are 'not very good at being human... the likeness is such that we are inclined to regard them... as incomplete humans rather than complete apes. We see the human infant in every mature chimpanzee, and treat it accordingly as a case of arrested development' (Ingold 1994: 28). Similarly, two attendants at a primate ethology course rim by the sanctuary once described chimpanzees to me as 'our little brothers'. They expressed the harm we did them as comparable to injury of younger (i.e. less developed), more vulnerable, members of our own family. It is already clear, then, that distinctions between man and animal are blurred in Western discourse, in which 'the human animal' is teased apart, in order to discover the essence of 'man'. What is it that allows scientists to compare infants with chimpanzees, where they would be unlikely to do so with human adults? Ingold (1989) suggests that it was in reaction to the strongly Darwinian current of the late C19th, which sought to 'downgrade man' to pure organism with advanced brain, that Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="14">14 Lys Alcayna-Stevens 'Culture' emerged as the attribute of man which made him8 uniquely human. 'If cultural differences shined so vividly' notes Latour (2002: 6), 'this was because the unity of nature provided the common denominator'. Correspondingly, the unity of animals as automata mechanica allowed the human sciences and philosophies to devote their attention to the various diverse flourishings of man's mind and soul.9 Borderlands &amp; Hybrid Histories Within our own Order, however, even in the biological sciences, such boundaries became difficult to draw with any certainty. 'Linnaeus', Agamben writes, 'had a weakness for apes' (2004: 23). He classified them Anthropomorpha (which became the Order Primates in 1758) - 'human like' - and could find no 'generic difference' between simians and men (Linnaeus 1964). Contemporary biological and evolutionary anthropologists struggle to explain where 'humanity' resides in our 0.6% genetic difference with chimpanzees. Do chimpanzees have material and symbolic culture (McGrew 2004; Whiten et al 1999)? Are they strategising and /or altruistic individuals (de Waal 1989)? Do gorillas have a sense of self, and of time? Do they subsequently experience a fear of death and hopes for their future (Patterson &amp; Gordon 2001)? Do vervets have different words for different predators - including a generic word for 'man' (Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1990)? Can chimpanzees meaningfully communicate in a human language (Fouts 1998)? Answers to such questions ultimately concern what makes us 'uniquely human', and many argue that evasive definitions of nonhuman 'protoculture, or preculture, or infraculture, or quasiculture' as opposed to fully human Culture (McGrew 2004:16) will not hold out forever. Agamben interprets Linnaeus' philosophical adage 'nosce te ipsum' as an emphasis that man has no specific identity other than his ability to recognise himself, and that to do so, he must constantly compare himself to other animals. Raging debates about whether 'peaceful bonobos' (cf. de Waal 1989) or 'aggressive chimpanzees' (cf. Wrangham &amp; Peterson 1996) are a better model for man's evolutionary past and 'natural' I use the masculine here, because many of these discourses saw man as the prime mover in evolution, with women's changing biological and behavioural traits as a product of his 'coat-tails' (Lovejoy 1981; DeVore &amp; Lee 1968; Oakley 1949; but cf. Rosaldo 1980). It is important to note that nature and culture were at times used synonymously at the sanctuary. Part of the reason the chimpanzees were understood to behave differently from the humans was that they have different standards, codes and natures. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="15">In the Shadow of Man 15 proclivities, also implicitly concern, therefore, the contemporary 'human condition' and man's future hopes and potential. Haraway explores how the 'boundary disputes written into the bodies of primates - fossil and living... involve the major themes of modern history, from decolonisation to nuclear war to feminism' (Haraway 1989: 331). She explores how in the US, marriage counselling, immigration policy, and the testing industry are all directly indebted to primates and primatologists. Our hybrid histories interweave philosophy and science, the exotic and the familiar, the past and the future, earth and space. It was, after all, in the same decade as Goodall and David Greybeard touched hands in mutual wonder in 'the wilds of Tanzania', that the chimpanzee Ham was shot into suborbital flight as part of the United States man-in-space program. Nonetheless, it is clear from the reams of anthropological literature refuting the nature-culture dichotomy, acknowledging the agency of nonhuman actors and questioning the 'uniqueness' of this 'face in the sand' (Foucault 2001) that such dichotomies and boundaries still remain significant, and particularly within our Primate Order. Forms, Flesh &amp; Fractals: 'Learning to Speak Chimpanzee' The cat I am talking about is a real cat, truly, believe me, a little cat. It isn't the figure of a cat. It doesn't silently enter the room as an allegory for all the cats on the earth, the felines that traverse myths and religions, literatures and fables... - Jacques Derrida, The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow) 'Fleshy, Material-Semiotic Presences' The passage above is quoted by Haraway in her most recent book When Species Meet (2008: 19). She describes the realisation Derrida has one morning while in his bathroom, when he notices his cat observing him. Eventually, his curiosity at what the cat may be thinking loses out over his sudden shame at being naked in front of her. This excerpt is fascinating on several levels. Derrida's short-lived willingness to engage with the question of what his cat is thinking recalls the difficulty in western academic discourse to phrase questions about animals' thoughts, minds, desires and emotions. More importantly, however, I am eager to emphasise that the real chimpanzees at the sanctuary are not understood in the abstract - as 'figures' or 'forms'; they are engaged with as real, 'fleshy, material-semiotic presences' (Haraway 2003: 5), embedded in a matrix of inter- and intra-species relationships, in the sanctuary and beyond. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="16">16 Lys Alcayna-Stevens However, I would also like to build on the idea of Platonic 'Forms'. In Book V of The Republic (1941), Plato describes Forms as 'originals', or abstract 'essences', of which all material things are merely imperfect copies. The Chimpanzee Form, for example, would be the 'perfect essence' of chimpanzeeness, while a real chimpanzee at the sanctuary, with her scars and neuroses, would be but a flawed copy. Consider the following passage by Goodall, which describes the juvenile chimpanzee Lucy, who had grown up 'as a human child'. She describes Lucy as (Goodall 1990:10/11): a changeling, her essential chimpanzeeness overlaid by the various human behaviours she had acquired over the years. No longer purely chimp yet eons away from humanity, she was man-made, some other kind of being I now wish to explore, through an ethnographic analysis of 'de humanisation', 're-socialisation' and interspecies interaction, what constitutes 'essential chimpanzeeness' at the sanctuary, how this is differentiated from 'humanity', and how these identities continually emerge and change through everyday discourse and practice. Boundaries at the Sanctuary: De-humanising Chimpanzees Victor is sulking. Yesterday, while cleaning out his half of the socialising jaulas, Alba moved his hammock closer to the entrance of the sleeping quarters. Victor does not yet sleep indoors at night. He is too afraid of the other chimpanzees. Alba had hoped that by moving his hammock from his preferred corner, in which he is far from the chimps he dislikes so much, and free to observe the keepers passing back and forth, he might engage more with the other chimps, and be more encouraged to enter the sleeping quarters which have been carefully prepared for him. However, he now sits, huddled under his blanket, miserable and dejected, dripping with rain, on the floor of his cage. Alba is standing next to me - Victor is pointedly looking away from her - explaining how difficult it is proving to socialise him, to teach him to speak chimpanzee. 'When he arrived' she explains, 'he was making strange sounds no chimp should make - that no chimp could recognise. He wouldn't eat any of the fruit and monkey chow we gave him. He was like, "where's the pizza?" He thinks he's human.' ***** Alba's conclusion not only effortlessly attributes Victor his own perspective and sense of self, but simultaneously denies the validity of that perspective. It is surely a perspectival stance, one which asserts a Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="17">In the Shadow of Man 17 world in which there are entities definable as either 'human' or 'chimpanzee'. Nonetheless, it also acknowledges that these entities can at times become blurred. While the chimpanzees' subjectivities, personalities and temperaments are always taken into account by keepers, it must be emphasised that one of the aims is nonetheless to cultivate them into the Form of a 'real' Chimpanzee. Being de humanised implies an undoing of Victor's false aspirations of humanity, which now overlay his essential chimpanzeeness. Two preoccupations become visible in the light of such an objective: how to isolate and undo these human influences? And, what is the core of this essential chimpanzeeness? As Haraway notes, 'a "self" is a complex historical construction' (1989: 146). The humanised self craving pizza, which Alba perceives Victor to perceive himself to be, is a spatially, temporally situated self. These chimpanzees have been 'humanised' in a particular way. All have lived in European families at a young age, worn baby clothes, played with children's toys, eaten sweets and junk food. Most have acted in advertisements in which they portray comedic human roles, and visitors are in awe of Marco's reputed ability to ride a motorbike. Where then, is the spatio-temporal 'Form of the Chimpanzee' situated in discourses about captive chimpanzee rehabilitation? Keepers often referred to the wild chimpanzee in their descriptions of essential chimpanzeeness. Wild life was conceived of as intrinsically social, one of freedom, space and power, a challenging but rewarding environment in nature, at peace from human interference; a social, natural and inherently conspecific environment. It is interesting to note that 'learning to speak chimpanzee' is not only a process of re-socialisation, but also of re naturalisation, in that it encompasses a relearning of bodily as well as social being. This focus on body recalls much anthropological literature which explores shared substance as an important factor in shared identity (e.g. Viveiros de Castro 1998). Chimpanzees are therefore introduced to a more 'natural' diet, and to a more 'naturalistic' environment; they are provided with vitamins and enrichment hidden in a way which is supposed to help them simulate wild foraging or problem-solving behaviours. One such example is termite fishing (using tools to retrieve honey and muesli from artificial termite mounds),10 which, although not practiced by the majority of wild chimpanzee populations, and not always practiced in the same way, has gained fame i° Objects such as the concrete termite mounds are not 'natural' in the sense often employed by the Keepers and Researchers - they can be opened and regulated, like everything at the sanctuary, which is carefully measured and controlled.

Let us pause here to consider Ingold's question: 'by what right do we conventionally identify the artificial with the man-made?' (2000:174). One could easily substitute Ingold's weaverbird with a nest-building chimpanzee,11 who 'through an active exploration of the possibilities afforded by the environment, in the choice of materials and structural supports, and of bodily capacities of movement, posture, and prehension' adjusts its movements 'with exquisite precision in relation to the evolving form of its construction' (2000: 359). This dialogical relationship with and through the environment in the creative act will be explored in more detail shortly. Here, the most important thing to emphasise is that the material world is seen as very significant to chimpanzee experience. 'Enrichment should be fun...' reads the welfare folder in the little Research office above the Education room; it should be 'challenging and stimulating to the senses: olfactory, auditory, tactile, digestive and visual'. Keepers and chimpanzees parallel one another in imagined embodiment and dialogical enactment, as shoe boxes are filled with walnuts, monkey chow and apple pieces, fixed together, and then disassembled and consumed. Nonetheless, enrichment is carefully monitored so that certain objects, which are deemed dangerous or damaging to the chimpanzees, are avoided. This includes sharp objects, large objects with which they could damage the fences, and glues or other toxins. Interestingly, it also involves certain 'humanised' objects such as clothing. Clothes would place the chimpanzees once more in an unidentified borderland, a limbo of quasi-human parody. Furthermore, it was explained to me that clothing would 'remind' the chimpanzees of their traumatic past and give the wrong impression to visitors. Nonetheless, I would like here to note the observation of a young Dutch researcher who was analysing the effects of different forms of enrichment on social interaction. She noted that of all the objects, blankets were the most popular. They were fought over, claimed, bartered, stolen, protected and played with. We discussed why this might be, and eventually decided that blankets could easily be attached to selves; they could be manipulated and transformed, they were mobile 11 Wild chimpanzees build a new sleeping nest every evening, from branches and leaves. They sleep in the canopy. In captivity, chimpanzees build nests from whatever they can find - blankets, straw, etc - they also like to sleep high up, in hammocks, if possible.

In short, they could be transformed into 'extensions of self'. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="20">20 Lys Alcayna-Stevens Re-Socialisation and the Dividual Chimpanzee It is late in the evening. Romie and Toto have made their way slowly and wearily to the entrance of the sleeping quarters. They both sit quietly, several meters apart, content within their own worlds, as they wait for the keepers to let them in. That is, until Juanito crashes onto the scene, tumbling and rolling with youthful exuberance. He chases Toto, who enthusiastically obliges; leap-frogging slowly away to tease his tiny pursuer. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Toto, Juanito has bounded over to Romie - whom I have rarely seen engage in any sort of energetic physical interaction. He rolls over and begins kicking at her with his feet, and she responds by slapping his soles with her palms, pretending to catch them in her teeth and bite them. Both of their faces are illuminated with a playful and toothy grin. A moment later Juanito jumps to his feet and begins to gallop towards Toto's lumbering form. * * * * * The head researcher, Miquel, once described to me how lucky the sanctuary was to have rescued five-year old Juanito, who is a catalyst for social interaction: 'He is the life and soul of the family group! They indulge him - he can get away with anything! He is central to interaction and cohesion. He is more natural than them because he has been raised Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="21">In the Shadow of Man 21 by them, among chimpanzees. But he makes them more chimpanzee too'. Social dynamics are appreciated at the sanctuary; chimpanzee culture and sociality is not seen to pass from elders to youngsters; it is a dialogical and relational process, negotiated by all members of the group. As Ingold notes, 'the unsocialised individual is an asocial individual, locked in a private world of meaningless sensation' (1991: 371). Nonetheless, chimpanzees must become socialised in the correct way, with the correct species, not to be 'some other kind of being'. Furthermore, although habitus was seen as very important in socialising chimpanzees, they were also conceived of as partly responsible for socialising themselves through techniques of the self (Foucault 2000). Thus Juanito was praised for his 'ape antics' while Nico was chastised for rolling his tongue at me, something he had picked up from one of the volunteers. Let us explore the concept of the 'dividual' in order to consider the description one volunteer gave me of how chimpanzees who are alone 'shrink', and how they 'grow' the farther their social networks extend. It is certainly the case that at the sanctuary chimpanzees are perceived as composite and multiply authored. Each has a complex history which has marked them, and they are made up of multiple overlayings: not only chimpanzee and human, but infant, adult, dominant, subordinate, aggressor, victim, playmate, protector. These identities are relational; without their relationships the chimpanzees at the sanctuary would be but a shrunken shadow of their current selves. Marriott (1976 in Strathern 1988: 178) argues that 'what goes on between actors are the same connected processes of mixing and separation that go on within actors'. The fractal nature of a chimpanzee is therefore what links it to what we might call its 'social group', and the other dividuals which shape this entity. Furthermore, this observation is not limited to conspecificity; many of the keepers have special relationships, which support them and provide them with roles and identities at the sanctuary. Darren (a long term volunteer from Cardiff), for example, talks about chimpanzee Tico (the first chimp to 'accept' him when he was still training as a keeper) as 'one of the lads', and 'a really decent bloke', whose presence keeps him going when things are tough. One is tempted to suppose that Tico feels the same way: he will always emerge from his lethargic broodings when Darren greets him. 'La Visit a' Cristina is leading a Visit. The chimpanzees and the humans stand, sit and shuffle about, watching one another. Toto yawns and I see an old Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="22">22 Lys Alcayna-Stevens woman doing the same before returning her attention to Cristina - chimpanzee yawns are contagious to humans. All of the observer observed are swatting at the flies who proliferate in the summer heat. As usual, the people furthest from Cristina (the ones with small and noisy children) are not listening carefully to the descriptions she is giving of the chimps' histories and personalities. They are enjoying the fascination of their enraptured offspring who are staring at Juanito and Bongo. The two young chimps are equally transfixed by the children, who - if they were to stand bipedally - are roughly their size. Juanito begins to pass a stick carefully underneath the fence, avoiding the wire he knows would shock him if he touched it. Once it is through, he hops back and sits staring at the children. The eldest, about five or six, points at the stick with his chubby index finger and looks up imploringly at his mother. She shakes her head. * * * * * Something is happening here, which enables these two different species to interact, and simultaneously makes them intensely interesting to each other. There is an interspecific exchange of gaze, of invitation, and of wonder. Juanito seems to be inviting the child to partake in his world. If the little boy would only toddle over to the fence, and pass the small stick back to Juanito, one feels that somehow two worlds might be forced to converge on the object, or indeed, that in the process, a new shared world may emerge.

It reveals itself in the worlds... with which sensual perception surrounds all living beings as if with bubbles that are sharply delineated but invisible to the outside observer - Thure von Uexkiill; Meaning and Science in Jakob von Uexkull's Concept of Biology Insides, Outsides For Descartes, only humans had minds; only they had inner worlds which fashioned for them an image of the outer world they inhabited. There have been numerous attempts to go beyond the Cartesian philosophy in which organisms (or objects) are acted upon by forces external to themselves. Approaches such as that of Goodwin (1989), emphasise process and relationality instead, so that 'causality becomes immanent rather than transient, and what we call objects and their environments are self-generating complementary forms' (ibid 1989: 30). For Goodwin, dynamic relationships are 'generated across the moving, fuzzy boundary between inner and outer, subject and object. Life is relational order, lived at the interface' (1989: 30). Such an approach could Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="24">24 Lys Alcayna-Stevens be seen to situate the dividual within the environment of which it is a part. I seek here to explore the relation within organism and environment, and to ask how it might be possible to participate in the world and 'reality' of another, through an exploration of subjects, objects and Umwelten (von Uexklill 1957; 1982a). Spaces &amp; identities' Before exploring contemporary approaches to the dialogical relations of organism and environment, I will ground these problems in ethnographic observations of the entanglement of space and identity at the sanctuary. Spaces were often defined in terms of those who occupied them: instalacion de la Familia, de los Machos, de 'los Dos' (this referred to the socialising cages inhabited by Tico and Victor), sitio de los voluntarios. The spaces which characters inhabited, and those which were available to them, formed part of the various identities they possessed. Access to certain parts of the enclosures, for example, demarcated the roles and identities of keepers from those of researchers. Furthermore, 'Los Working' paid for the privilege of transcending the spaces limited to visitors, and ascending the little wooden stairs which led to the observation tower, or the gravel path which allowed one to cross the gate marked animales peligrosos and approach the chimpanzees within. Members of the sanctuary disagreed as to where the 'real' personalities of the chimps were most clearly visible. Keepers (who it must be noted rarely spend time watching the chimpanzees while they are outside) argued that their true colours could only be appreciated on 'the inside', while researchers (who spend all of their time observing the chimpanzees in their outdoor enclosures) emphasised the cramped, unnatural, frenzied situation of the inside cages, in which the chimpanzees were not thought to display 'natural' behaviour at all. Having experienced everyday life as both a keeper and a researcher, it became clear how radically the spaces one occupied could shift one's perspective. As a keeper helping to prepare breakfasts and dinners, and checking enclosures in the mornings, for example, I watched the chimpanzees as they wandered towards the kitchen to peer inside at the volunteers. I witnessed the keeper's attempt to reclaim a box one volunteer had left in the enclosure while he was fixing a structure, and felt the tension evaporate as Toni finally accepted the offering of a shining plum and honourably fetched the box in return. Small exchanges, soft grunts of affection and sociability invisible to binoculars, Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="25">In the Shadozv of Man 25 here, made real beings out of the sketches of chimpanzees one sometimes felt oneself to be watching from the observation tower. In a sense, spaces can be seen to accompany the presence of organisms, and to exist only in their presence. Although boundaries were clearly demarcated and the chimpanzees' spaces were respected by the keepers, these spaces were only seen to fully 'belong' to the chimpanzees when they occupied them. That is, during cleaning, the recintos and jaulas were 'safely' occupied by humans, but once the chimpanzees were released into them, in the morning, the spaces became chimpanzee. It is important to note, nonetheless, that if one paused and breathed in the air when standing in the centre of an enclosure, looked at the structures, the fences, and the observation posts beyond, it was as though the chimpanzees had left behind some part of their selves. As though one was walking the very paths made visible through their movements, experiencing the dips and scratches, the torn foliage, worn posts and dusty tunnels shaped through their interactions. At the same time, places were also seen as contained within entities. Therefore, the chimp enclosures, and the chimpanzees themselves, were described by one reporter who came to document a snippet of extraordinary Catalonian life, as 'a little bit of Africa in rural Catalunya'. As Haraway notes; 'the field' is more than a term for 'the physical-social space where people watch uncaged animals', it is 'what makes "the monkey'" (1989:116) - and the monkey in return, it seems, is what makes the field. Perspective &amp; Perception: the Umwelt Each animal species is in a constant process of adaptation to its environment, which is itself a complex network of innumerable organisms all of which are in a constant process of mutual adaptation. As Ingold notes, the environment is, literally, that which surrounds, and therefore presupposes something to be surrounded; 'take away the organism, and the environment disappears with it' (1989: 504). Animal and environment form an inseparable dyad (Gibson 1979); a relation which goes beyond 'between', and is instead 'part of'. Von Uexkull sought to go beyond the professional language of the natural sciences, which reduced all phenomena to nothing but their quantitative aspects, and thereby eliminated significance, meaning and quality (von Uexkull 1982b). Such approaches could only be used to describe objects; they ignored subjects and subjectivities, making nothing of the relations between subjects, and between subjects and objects. For von Uexkull, each animal is a subject within its own Umwelt, or subjective universe. Experience of this Umwelt is tied to the sensory Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="26">26 Lys Alcayna-Stevens apparatus of the animal, and therefore inseparable from its bodily existence. However, von Uexkull was no dualist, and thus body is not conceived in opposition to mind in the discussion which follows. Indeed, the emphasis on a bodily experience of reality is somewhat analogous to perspectivist ontology. As Ingold notes (2000: 94), in Amerindian cosmology, clothing does not cover up the body, it is the body; rather than a covering up, it is an 'opening up' of the subject to the world. Von Uexkull wonders what might happen were one to gain access to these 'invisible worlds'. A familiar meadow, he proposes, would be transformed; that is, 'many of its colourful features disappear, others no longer belong together but appear in new relationships. A new world comes into being' (1957: 5). Furthermore, he does not presuppose one overarching reality or environment within which each of these worlds, or Umwelten, take shape. Indeed, he asserts that 'the Umwelt of any animal that we wish to investigate is only a section carved out of the environment which we see spread around it - and this environment is nothing but our own human world' (ibid 1957: 13). Von Uexkull was adamant that since every animal is inevitably a participant in its world and since it never plays the role of an indifferent observer, it cannot enter into relationships with neutral (perspectivalist) objects. The 'quality' of an object is always acquired by virtue of its having entered into a relationship with the subject organism. For example, an object which might be experienced as an anvil for the capuchin monkey which uses it to break open nuts, may be chosen as a weapon for a dominant chimpanzee to hurl in an impressive display. Furthermore, it may just as easily not exist in the Umwelt of an organism which has no use for it. In appropriating and giving meaning to the objects which form its Umwelt, they always inevitably form part of an organism's very identity, and could thus be described to be as much part of its 'dividuality' as relationships with other subjects. How, then, might it be possible to shift one's perspective from that of the familiar meadow? Understanding and experiencing the Umwelt of another is certainly a possibility, or it would be impossible to train a dog for the blind. Such canines must learn to give meaning to objects which would not normally have any salience in their Umwelt; these must be brought into existence and taken into account in novel situations: a curb their blind owner could trip on, or a slightly low door frame on which she may bump her head. Such an analogy also demonstrates that Umwelten are not static, nor species-dependent. Ingold suggests that Mum-making Telefol girls 'develop their looping skills at a time of life when their bodies are also undergoing rapid growth... these skills... far Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="27">In the Shadow of Man 27 from being added to a preformed body, actually grow with it' (2000: 360). If we take this process of oritogenic development to be lifelong, it becomes clear that animals' Umwelten, too, could change over time. It could be the case that, even after a month of observing the chimpanzees, and of living with them, when climbing their structures, it became effortless to perceive that world partly through an Umwelt more similar to their own: where the structures meant vantage points, physical challenges, and enjoyment, rather than the routine job of affixing hosepipes. I am suggesting, therefore, that in sharing objects and attributing them similar meaning, chimpanzees and keepers are at their most communicative and interactive. De Waal notes that 'chimpanzees are famous for their trademanship' (1989: 82). Indeed, it was often in the exchange of sticks, food and objects which belonged to 'the other side', that chimpanzees and keepers seemed closest to sharing an Umwelt, despite the boundary of the wire-mesh. On one occasion, Bongo was behaving very strangely and kept scratching at his leg with a stick and then turning his back to me. Suddenly, he stood up on three legs; holding the fourth up with the stick, which he had hooked onto an elastic band attached to his thigh. He looked pointedly at me and then at the leg. I called Darren, and after greeting him enthusiastically, Bongo immediately showed him the elasticised leg. Darren put out his hand and asked Bongo to pass him the elastic. Bongo began to pass it beneath the fence in the palm of his hand. Looking at Darren, he realised the keeper would not quite be able to reach it without touching the electric wire, and grasped the elastic with the tips of his fingers instead, crouching low so that Darren might easily claim it - which he did, much to Bongo's satisfaction. Becoming a Social Subject Von Uexkiill asserts that the subject of one Umwelt may become the object of another: a chimpanzee, for example, may be nothing but a source of food to a tick. How though, might the subject of one Umwelt attribute subjectivity to the subject of another? Let us pause here on a description Haraway takes from the writing of Barbara Smuts, 'a behavioural anthropologist who writes courageously about intersubjectivity and friendship with and among animals' (Haraway 2003: 34). She recounts how Smuts initially observed her Eburru Cliffs baboon troop in the traditional detached manner of a western scientist, but soon realised the counterproductivity of this approach. She was unable to get close to the baboons, who avoided her as though she were some inconvenient blot in the landscape. Smuts Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="28">28 Lys Alcayna-Stevens therefore began adjusting to 'the way of the baboon', that is, she responded to cues the baboons used to indicate emotions, motivations and intentions, and sent signals back to them. From then on, if she got too close, they sent her dirty looks rather than moving away: she was no longer an object to be avoided, but a subject who could be communicated with. Haraway argues from the monkeys' point of view, that they 'inquired if the woman was as good a social subject as an ordinary baboon, with whom one could figure out how to carry on relationships, whether hostile, neutral or friendly. The question was not, are the baboons social subjects? But, is the human being?' (Haraway 2008: 25). I would like to suggest that the profusion of interspecific affect and emotion at the sanctuary occurs when the keepers accept the chimpanzees as social subjects, with whom they can form relationships, and who have perspectives of their own. Do the chimpanzees reciprocate, one is tempted to ask: do they ever view keepers as social subjects? One evening, before the Keepers left after a long day's work, Cristina described to the newest volunteers why it was that she had such a good relationship with Nico. The eight-year old suffers from Arnold Chiari Syndrome, (a congenital disease affecting the spinal cord, and causing immense pain) and needs frequent care from the keepers.12 Several years ago, he was under 24-hour surveillance. This was particularly problematic for the female keepers, because he would only show respect to Raul, the head keeper. One day, when the young chimp would not descend from the topmost corner of the room, Cristina did a 'big, crazy display'. Chimpanzees use displays in the wild and in captivity to demonstrate their feelings and to forcibly draw attention to themselves if they are being ignored or overlooked. Interestingly, they very rarely vocalise, and the significance of the display is created through their manipulation of the world around them; by tearing branches, throwing stones, or dragging wooden crates and plastic bottles. Cristina's display worked. Nico understood her subjectivity; he understood that she could become upset and frustrated by his actions, and that she was making him aware of this through her display. He understood that she would need to be appeased and respected, and thus 12 Nico has been treated by surgeons and doctors who normally deal with the syndrome in humans. In 2007, he was invited to join, as an honorary member, I'Asociacion de Familiares y Afectados de Chiari y Patologias Asociados in Catalonia. Shared suffering has been enough in this case to disregard any boundaries between human and chimpanzee. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1, 2008/2009</page><page sequence="29">In the Shadow of Man 29 descended slowly from the corner, 'hooooing' softly and apologetically at her. Cristina's display was repeated by each of the female keepers with whom Nico had contact, and his affection towards them now is truly touching. Conclusion Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has i spun - Clifford Geertz; The Interpretation of Cultures As the spider spins its threads, every subject spins his relations to certain characters of the things around him, and weaves them into a firm web which carries his existence - Jakob von Uexkiill; A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men 'Being' &amp; 'Having': linking Dividuals, Networks &amp; Umwelten Of the two quotes above - one from the father of hermeneutic cultural anthropology, the other from the founder of biosociality and ethology - both concern themselves with meaning. The difference between the two may appear subtle at first, but upon close reading, one realises that it is the second which more closely approximates the paradigm shift propelling certain strands of contemporary anthropology. If we turn to Geertz' (1973: 5) assertion, anthropos centres himself assertively in our mind's eye. This actor (the only actor we encounter) and the world he inhabits, are paramount. But, what of his world? He hovers 'suspended' before us, within his engulfing, self-spun creation: Culture. Nature, were it not for that single loose thread, 'animal' (which ties him to some Other, of which he is at once part and beyond), is an irrelevance. Through our encounter with von Uexkiill's (1957: 14) analogy, on the other hand, subjects, objects, worlds and relations of all kinds unfold before us. The actor, a spider, might just as easily be any subject (human, chimpanzee, cat), and is not 'suspended' within the web it has woven through relations with its world, but is carried - its labours open it up to the world. And what of this world? As we witness the spider in the process of spinning its threads, we realise that both spider, and 'characters of things' in its ever-changing Umwelt, are inseparable, as we are overwhelmed by the realisation that 'none of the partners pre exist the relating, and the relating is never done once and for all' (Haraway 2003:12). Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="30">30 Lys Alcayna-Stevens I turn now to a passage by Latour, in which he advocates a brief but meaningful observation by Tarde (1999 in Latour 2002: 129), and asks himself: what would Western philosophy have been if it had been founded on the verb (web?) 'to have', rather than the verb 'to be'? from the principle 'I am', it is impossible to deduce any other existence than mine, in spite of all the subtleties of the world. But affirm first the postulate 'I have' as the basic fact, then that which is had as well as that which has are given at the same time as inseparable Through a brief glimpse into the spider's world, von Uexkull merely touches upon the complexity of the meadow he encounters in his 'stroll through unfamiliar worlds': in which each subject has as parts of itself, innumerable characters of the subjects and objects around it and significant to it, while characters within it are at once had by numerous other subjects participating within their own Umzvelten. Understanding Another's Perspective Returning to the questions posed in the introduction, how was it that keepers empathised with and understood chimpanzees, at the same time as acknowledging they could never know the mind of a chimpanzee? I have already touched upon the concept of doublethink. However, this concept becomes all the more interesting when one considers that the theory of Umwelten does not give primacy to 'reality' over 'imagination'; there is no opposition between mind and matter, or inner and outer in von Uexkiill's work. The multiple Umwelten we inhabit are not limited to 'actual' sensual perception; 'thoughtworlds' are just as important - indeed the two are one. As I moved out of the enclosure and onto the gravel path, negotiated and worn only by the feet of human primates, it was as though I had slipped from one bubble into another, in which my relations with things (subjects, objects, ontologies) were shifted, so that my previous understanding no longer felt consistent. I follow Ingold in taking 'intuitive understanding' as something which is 'not contrary to science or ethics, nor does it appeal to instinct rather than reason, or to supposedly 'hardwired' imperatives of human nature. On the contrary, it rests in perceptual skills that emerge, for each and every being, through a process of development' (Ingold 2000: 25). However, I would like to suggest that Umzvelten not only develop and transform with time, but that we can (and do) from minute to minute, shift between (and inhabit) multiple Umzvelten. It is within this lived paradox that both hybrids and boundaries proliferate. Cambridge Anthropology, 28:1,2008/2009</page><page sequence="31">In the Shadow of Man 31 References Agamben, G. 2004.
