La perdition (pèdisyon), au sens de répression de la grossesse, est jouée dans des drames sociaux entre Léogâne et Florida, des lieux habités par des ouvriers migrants pauvres au pays et leurs émissaires d'espoir à l'étranger. Les drames découlant de la répression de la fécondation franchissent non seulement les frontières natio nales mais aussi les frontières religieuses séparant les protes tants des catholiques. Mots-clés : Sexes, transnationalisme, affliction Anthropologica 54 (2012) 189-198 Distant members of a Haitian transnational community are creatively adapting an old reproductive affliction to mediate new, arduous experiences of prolonged con jugal separation and frustrated hopes of socio-economic advance. Pèdisyon, or perdition, has long been known in Haiti as a biomagical disorder believed to cause female subfecundity, a true purgatory in a society that highly values progeny. A case of perdition may occasionally be attributed to naturalistic causes, including exposure to "cold," and may respond to treatment by a midwife. But more often, the cause has to do with personal relation ships with persons and other categories of being. A wrath ful inherited, anthropomorphic spirit (Iwa), a malevolent force known as lougawo% or a sorcerer, working on behalf of an envious competitor, traps the fetus in the womb. A magical healing ritual can liberate the fetus and allow its normal development. Subfecundity is reformulated as a "personalistic" affliction (Foster 1976) whose diagnosis, accusation, magical therapy and ritual healing inform the script for a "social drama" (Turner 1957). Whereas diminished fertility appears to have been perdition's most frequent and agonizing symptom, as reported in past literature, accidental fecundity seems to have become a potent indication of the affliction today. Migration, a disorder dividing many Haitians' marriages, appears to have provided a new social and cultural ration ale for the perdition syndrome. The potential scandal of a home wife conceiving a child while her husband is abroad can be avoided through a diagnosis in hindsight of a repressed pregnancy. This paper describes how perdition has played out at the center of transnational social dramas enacted between Léogâne and Florida, the sites inhabited by impoverished migrant labour producers on the one hand and their hopeful emissaries outside (deyo) on the other. The dramas ensuing from repressed pregnancy have spanned religious boundaries as well as national lim its, breaching sectarian borders separating Protestants from Catholics in Haitian transnational communities.

The quintessential I suggested to Wilner's brother that Wilner's accus ation of his sister rests on the assumption that Wilner had been a "good" (generous) migrant. Wilner's brother agreed with my interpretation of the case. Wilner appears to be the productive migrant and, through no fault of his own, his wealth (byen) is being diverted and wasted. He claimed that his sister took the money he sent for his mother (and her) and then spent it on payment to a sorcerer to attack his wife's reproductive capacity, thereby preventing her from bearing heirs whose birth would have cemented the transnational marriage and cre ated more competitors for the migrant's wages. Wilner symbol of "sending to do for" family members at home is the construction of a new home out of such high-status materials as cinder block, cement and mosaic tile. Other symbols of "doing" include buying or renting cultivable land, purchasing livestock, buying a fishing boat, investing in a trade, financing children's school fees, meeting ritual obligations and sponsoring a relative's emigration. The migrant who abandons his family and is abandoned by his kin is like a "cow without a herdsman" (youn bèf san gadô), a disgrace to himself and his community.1 Idealized hopes for migrants' success abroad and real fears of the emissaries' failure or death "outside" are Anthropologica 54 (2012) Male Migration, Female Perdition /195</page><page sequence="8">driven home in a locally popular spirit song (chante Iwa) last saw Fanilia (in 2012), she signaled that she might be whose refrain is "do for me."
