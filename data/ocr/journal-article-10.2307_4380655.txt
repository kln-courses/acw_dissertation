<plain_text><page sequence="1">Klee's Cat and Bird Paul Klee's predilection for the small format picture repre- sents the logical consequence of an imagery derived from conception rather than perception. Dealing with the imag- ined rather than the seen, his art was engendered from what we might call the "screen" of the mind's eye, which, by nature, feels small. Indeed, as the Gestalt psychologists demonstrated long ago, this screen must be very small since it is commonly felt to be located just inside the fore- head, above the eyes. These considerations are especially relevant to an un- derstanding of Klee's Cat and Bird, a marvelous small oil painting that is one of the Museum's most recent acquisi- tions. In this picture Klee relies on our awareness, perhaps subconscious, of where this "screen" is located; other- wise, we would not grasp that the bird represented in the painting is not in front of the cat's head but inside it-quite literally, on his mind. Our apprehension that the bird is a thing imagined rather than seen by the cat is reinforced by Klee's treatment of the pupils of the cat's eyes, which ap- pear unfocussed on any exterior object. The obsessional nature of the cat's interest in the bird is further expressed by the rendering of the cat's head so that it almost fills the picture surface. Indeed, the cat's head is pressed so close to the picture-plane that its top seems anchored to the upper edge; while at the bottom the cat's whiskers reach out like delicate, seismologically responsive antennae to the corners of the field. The conceptual nature of Cat and Bird is underscored by the fact that its two characters are shown either in absolute profile: the bird, or strict frontality; the cat. Psychologists confirm that this sort of imagery is characteristic of con- ceptualizing rather than observing. Children will, for ex- ample, tend to draw in profile or frontally not simply because of the difficulty of foreshortening but because their visual thinking is profoundly conceptual. If asked to close your eyes and simply to think of a cat, bird, cow or any other such figure, you would in all likelihood envision it not from above, below or obliquely, as you would be most likely to confront the object in nature, but frontally or in profile, the views that deliver the most comprehensive idea of the object. Klee loved cats and they are a frequent theme in his art; this tenderness entirely permeates the coloring and facture of Cat and Bird. Klee's identification with cats is ex- pressed here (perhaps unconsciously) in the treatment of the eyes and in the silhouetting of the head, both of which are reminiscent of Klee's self-portraits. The anthropomor- phic aspect of the cat's head is emphasized by the omis- sion, at the top of the image, of feline ears, and by the introduction, at the bottom, of a totally uncatlike neck, which supports the head in a human rather than animal manner. Our sense of the cat's hunger for the bird is expressed through our enforced association with the two reddish areas of the picture. As he climbs along the lines of the cat's brow, which also serve as tree branches, the bird is surrounded by a reddish glow, perhaps emanating from the sun whose disk hovers above him. This same red is picked up in the area of the cat's mouth, and again around the nose where it undergoes a slight change in hue and a 1 7 Paul Klee. Cat and Bird. 1928.

The heart shape used to denote the nose relates simultaneously to the theme of the desire of the cat for the bird and the empathy of Klee with the cat. It is also possible, as Robert Rosenblum has sug- gested, that the configuration of the cat's jowls, chin and nose allude to the human female genitalia and buttocks thus projecting on to a specific anthropomorphic plane the theme of love and desire. We cannot know, of course, whether Klee wished to suggest such an association, but that he may have is eminently consistent with the nature of his imagination. While his pictures rarely contain ex- plicit sexual themes, the erotic frequently hovers in veiled ways just outside the given, or donne, of the image. Many of Klee's oil paintings belong to series or groups (e.g., the Magic Squares and Egyptian Landscapes) where- as Cat and Bird is a unique image in his oeuvre as regards its handling if not its motif. The painting has been widely illustrated and widely exhibited; it came to America when it was shown in The Museum of Modern Art's first exhibi- tion of Klee of 1930, at which time it belonged to the artist. It was purchased from that exhibition by Dr. F.H. Hirsch- land, whose heirs sold a partial interest in the picture to the Museum last summer and gave the remaining equity as a gift. The Museum is immensely indebted to Mr. Sidney Janis, through whose assistance the necessary pur- chase funds for Cat and Bird were raised.
