<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAUDE GANDELMAN UNIVERSITY OF THE NECEV Finnegans Wake and the Anthropomorphic Landscape Although Joyce and his work have been termed "Mannerist" by a number of writers,1 there has never been a concrete attempt to relate specifically the style of Joyce?in particular the style of Finnegans Wake?to the pictorial productions of Mannerism.2 The present article explores in detail the relationship which exists between Finnegans Wake and those two specific creations of sixteenth-century Mannerism, the anthropomorphic landscape and the anamorphic landscape.3 That the overall physiognomy of Finnegans Wake is that of an an? thropomorphic landscape has been sensed by the authors of A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake in which the beginning ofthe book is described: "The scene begins to disintegrate. Outlines of the hills show through the lineaments of the wake. Hurrah! It is all one and the same: Finnegan's form is that of the landscape."4 As a matter of fact, one glance at the first pages of the Wake suffices to discover the sleeping giant sprawled across the pages of the book: . . . Him a being so on the flounder of his bulk like an overgrown babeling . . . from Shopalist to Bailiwick or from ashtun to baronoath or from 1 See for example Jacques Bousquet, Manierisme (Braziller, 1964), p. 232; E.

Eric Mosbacher (Knopf, 1965), pp. 374-378; and G. R.

Das Wortspiel [pun] ist seiner tragenden Pfeiler," p. 305. Hocke simply selects Joyce's "Pan- sexualismus" as his chief "Mannerist" characteristic: "der innere Monolog der Dame Bloom, am ende des Ulysses [ist] eine Hohepunkt des manieristischen Pansexualimus," p. 195. 3 The author wishes to thank the Commission for Basic Research of the Israel Academy of Science, whose research grant made the present article possible. 4 H.

(4/ 32-36; 5/1-4) One distinctly sees Finnegan-the-skyscraper whose head, a "roundhead staple," looms over Manhattan Island "celescalating the himals [sky] and all." In the same way, the Anna Livia chapter depicts woman as a river5 or, conversely, the river asa woman. Let us listen tothe speech ofthe river: Rise it, flut ye, pian piena!

Here, then, we have the portrait of a female river-shape flowing across a landscape and merging into it. Actually, it takes some effort on the part of the reader to discover the human body lying in the midst of the topographic chaos, for it is hidden behind a topographic-linguistic carapace. But is not an effort of the same type demanded of us when we look at the reversible Mannerist "landscape-heads" ofthe sixteenth century? As a matter of fact, the images that irresistibly come to mind when one slowly deambulates through the linguistic circumvolutions of Finnegans Wake are in fact the anthropomorphic landscapes by Arcimboldi or 5 On this subject see also my article, "Blake, Pre-Raphaelism and Finnegans Wake," in Orbis Litterarum, No. 4 (1975).</page><page sequence="3">FINNEGANS WAKE 41 Momper, landscapes such as one can see in the Lebel collection in Paris6 or in the Wintle collection in Durban.7 Like Arcimboldi, Joyce in Finnegans Wake shows himself to be a master ofthe permanent reversi- bility between anatomical and topographical "geography." Does this mean that Joyce drew his inspiration from Italian Man- nerism? Although this is possible, no evidence that he ever came in close contact with Arcimboldi's work, either in Milan or elsewhere, can be found in his letters and essays. Yet one must not forget that Joyce lived in a period when a revival of Mannerism?in the guise of Cubism or Surrealism?was taking place and that it was, in particular, a revival of the genre of "landscape-heads." Actually, if there is no concrete evidence that Joyce was acquainted with Mannerist art, there is a great deal of evidence concerning his personal contacts with those twentieth-century painters who, according to the criteria of such specialists as Hocke, Hauser, and Bousquet, may well qualify to receive the "Mannerist" tag: Picasso, Brancusi, Fernand Leger, Wyndham Lewis, and so forth, all of whom are mentioned recur- rently in the Collected Letters.8 Joyce visited several times Leger's studio as well as that of Wyndham Lewis (Lewis is mentioned thirty-three times in the Letters)..Indeed, from the data in the Letters, Joyce emerges as a man who was sufficiently aware of the development of modern painting to have realized that a revival ofthe composite "landscape-head" was taking place. There are landscape-heads in the work of Dali, of Klee, and in the works of the Constructivists in Russia, particularly in the graphic work of El Lissitzki.9 Incidentally, in Paris Joyce met Eisenstein, who was deeply influenced by Constructivism. From Mary Seton's biography of Eisenstein we know that, among other things, they discussed the theory of "montage." In? deed, cannot one claim that Eisenstein's habit of superimposing gigantic 6 All those landscape-portraits are reproduced in Benno Geiger's excellent book.

Moreover, the landscape-head was being revived not only in the work of individual artists, but also in the art of the poster at the very time when Joyce was writing the Wake. At the time of the 1933 election in America, a picture such as Beall's "Find what Roosevelt means to the U.S.A."10 must have been reproduced in papers and magazfnes throughout the world. The composite heads and bodies by El Lissitzki were reproduced in the magazine L'URSS Construit distributed in France.11 Owing to the prevailing influence on the Constructivists and Surrealists, El Lissitzki also composed a head of Lenin which was made up of the Russian masses, while in Fascist Italy posters showed Musso? lini's head as made up of the Italian crowds.12 As we can see, owing to the prevailing influence of Constructivism and Surrealism, landscape-heads and Mannerist heads invaded the mass media and became a standard characteristic of the film.

Another feature of Mannerism?of the sixteenth century or otherwise?is that the containing form duplicates (or is duplicated by) the elements of which it is made up. Thus one head by Arcimboldi is constituted of a multitude of smaller heads and bodies.13 A nineteenth- century German caricature of Napoleon shows his head as being com? posed of corpses,14 and so forth. The principle here is the well-known "totus in toto et totus in qualibet parte" of Mannerism. But is it not precisely the same feature, transferred to the plane of language, that we find in Finnegans Wa/ce?

(417/11-17 [dvorak, Hebrew for bee; farfalla, Italian for butterfly; apis, Latin for bee, etc]) These gigantic insect- and river-bodies are structurally very much like the Arcimboldi head mentioned above. They also evoke a famous pic? ture which may well have been known to Joyce: the portrait of the giant Leviathan which is found on the title page of the most common edition of Hobbes's Leviathan.15 The gigantic figure of the man holding crown and scepter is made up of the bodies of the citizens in the "Common? wealth" and is the symbol of Hobbes's ideal society in which the people chose their central authority. 15 Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan: or the Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical and Civil (London: printed for John Bohn, 1839).</page><page sequence="7">.\1pm est/mftsttts SttjH-r Tcrntm quw t't-mjutrrtttr ri.?Joli xli. 24. Hobbes, Leviathan As a matter of fact, the figure of Leviathan appears in one of Joyce's early poems (1904) entitled "The Holy Office:" To sister mummers one and all I act as vicar general And for each maiden, shy and nervous, I do a similar kind service At night when close in bed she lies And feels my hand between her thighs My little love in light attire Knows the soft flame that is desire. But Mammon places under ban The uses of Leviathan.16 To the name "Leviathan" Richard Ellmann, in his edition of the poem, added the note, "The heroic, individualistic Satan: here Joyce." Though one may be reluctant to identify Leviathan and Satan, there is no doubt that Joyce sees himself here as an erotic giant that sexually "consumes" nuns and maidens. The image smacks of psychoanalysis, even though at 16 The Critical Writings of james joyce, ed.

Indeed, one is reminded of the comparison between oral consumption made by Freud in Abriss der Psychoanalysis when he defines eating as "d/e Zerstorung des Ob- jekts mit dem Endziel der Einverleibung" and the sexual act as an aggressive impulse which had a similar "Endziel/' And it is extremely probable that the composite Mannerism of Finne? gans Wake should have been strengthened and further developed by Joyce's later acquaintance with the theories of psychoanalysis during his Trieste exile. Thus the ambient Mannerism of the age (Constructivism, Surrealism?and their reflection in publicity and propaganda) may have formed a confluence with a "deeper" Mannerist structure inherent in Joyce's mind and rooted in his Roman Catholicism, a structure which had become alive with new meanings under the impact of psychoanalysis. We can see that the anthropomorphic landscape-giant of the book, Finnegan, is the kaleidoscopic cluster of several souls represented by a number of names?such as Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, haveth childers everywhere, Hotschkuss Crocus Esquiloqus?all reducible to the anagram HCE, which means Here Comes Everybody: that is to say, the Joycean equivalent for the medieval "Everyman." Here one is brought back to the Judaeo-Christian myth of the "Adam Kadmon" which, at the beginning, contained the souls of all men,17 from which the medieval figure of Everyman is probably derived. But if Joyce's early Leviathan becomes an Everyman in the later work, one must not forget that he is also primarily a Father-Son-Brother- Husband-Child figure, just as Christ is at one and the same time son- brother of men as well as child and father (and, one may say, father of his own self since he is both man and God). Similarly, the female character, Anna Livia Plurabelle (Anna the Allmaziful, the bringer of Plurabilitie), is explicitly defined as wife- mother-daughter of Finnegan, just as Mary is wife-mother-daughter- child of her own God-child. Defined in these terms, the mysteries of the Roman Catholic creed can indeed be seen as a species of theological Mannerism which, no less than Oriental theogonies, consists a kaleido? scopic splintering of divine unity. 17 See G, Scholem, On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975), pp 104, 112-115, 128, 162.</page><page sequence="9">FINNEGANS WAKE 47 At the same time, it is easy to understand why the new Freudian "myth" could give new meaning and be readily integrated by Joyce into the Christian myth: does not Freudianism place the emphasis upon the telescopic character of each person? In the view of psychoanalysis, is not each one of us a kaleidoscope of father-son-husband elements or of mother-daughter-wife-sister elements? Has not psychoanalysis re? peatedly asserted that, as phantasms, these kaleidoscopic roles are completely interchangeable? But psychoanalysis did not only affect the contents of Joyce's works. Indeed, it has often been claimed that Finnegans Wake was but the description of a dream?and a Freudian dream at that, bristling with puns and word distortions, with instances of "condensation" and "dis? placement," just like the dreams recorded by Freud in his Traum- deutung. Yet here again we have a confluence between Finnegans Wake and the language of the dream as recorded by psychoanalysis, on the one hand, and between another creation of Mannerism, the anamorphic landscape, on the other. Finnegans Wake evokes the anamorphic landscape, or Vexierbild, based on the extreme distortion of perspective and not, like the Arcim? boldi portraits, on the juxtaposition of composite elements. From the Greek ana, again, and morphe, form, the name anamorphosis means that the original shape must be reconstructed by a visual effort on the part of the viewer. It is such an extreme distortion of landscape and portrait perspective that enabled a student of Durer, Erhard Schon, to turn a man into a landscape or to hide human figures inside the distorted representation of a landscape. Most of the Vexierbilder still extant are reproduced in Anamorphoses,18 the outstanding work on the subject. With a painter such as Schon, anamorphosis often serves to camou- flage obscene or scatological scenes. Thus the Vexierbild entitled /yAus, du alter Torl" ("Out, you old fool!") hides in the folds ofthe landscape the figure of a naked man who makes obscene gestures toward another man's genitals. In "Was siehst duV ("What do you see?") a man hidden inside the dividing line between shore and ocean is defecating. As a technique, this is very similar to Joyce's hiding of his pen(penis)- wielding Shem inside the landscape on the very first page of the Wake. Indeed, this first page of Finnegans Wake displays a profusion of topo- graphical scatological elements: 18 Anamorphoses.</page><page sequence="10">48 CLAUDE GANDELMAN Sir Tristaram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passencore rear- rived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor had topsawyer's rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselves to Laurens County's gorgios while they went doubling their mumpers all the time. . . . (1/4-9) The visible "honest" landscape elements are the "peninsula," "gorges," "rocks," and so forth. But they hide other, more obscene, images. Thus, "peninsula" is also "penis" or "pen-penis." The "rocks" that "top" "gorges" are evidently that of a male sex organ that "tops" "gorgeous" women?or possibly will "exaggerate itself" toward their "gorges." According to an exegete of Finnegans Wake, another passage of the book hides behind topographic terms "micturition, masturbation, defe- cation and sexual aggression."19 While Schon presents a visual enigma, Joyce writes a verbal anamorphosis. Here again, there is no evidence that Joyce was familiar with the genre of anamorphosis. Yet, again, he might have seen the portrait of Edward VI made in 1546 by William Scrots in the National Portrait Gallery in London.20 It is true that in this particular portrait the face of the king, distorted by anamorphosis, does not completely merge into the landscape, but is rather surrounded by it; yet the idea of its possible merging into the landscape is obvious enough. Other seventeenth and sixteenth-century anamorphic landscapes which Joyce may have seen are found in the cloister of the Trinity of the Mounts in Rome and in a church in Milan.21 The total effect of anamorphosis is well described by G. R. Hocke: "Man steht zunachst vor einem Wirr und Wildnis" ("One stands, at first, before a confusion, a jungle").22 It takes considerable effort and shifting of one's gaze on the part of the reader until the scatological content eventually emerges. However, these efforts only serve to enhance the shock effect of the hidden scatology when it suddenly comes to the fore. I think Joyce may have had this delayed shock effect in mind when he decided to impose upon his reader a prolonged deambulation inside the labyrinthic circumvolutions of Finnegan's obscene dreams (inside Fin- negan's landscape-bowels) without his being aware at first sight of what 19 Bernard Benstock, "Every Telling Has a Taling," Modern Fiction Studies, XV (1969), p. 5. 20 Reproduced in Anamorphoses, figure 11. 21 Anamorphoses, figures 37, 38, 39. 22 Hocke, Die Welt als Labyrinth, p. 127.</page><page sequence="11">FINNEGANS WAKE 49 he was doing. Actually, Joyce is a Traumarbeiter, if one may coin the phrase from Freud's concept of Traumarbeit, who consciously uses the technique of verbal anamorphosis to achieve what Freud calls the "manifest" appearance of the dream while suggesting all the time that a "latent" scatological content is not far behind the verbal appearance. Actually, very often the landscape of the dream is a Mannerist land? scape. For instance, the Traumdeutung describes someone going "peacefully with two tramps into a church, to which a great many steps Schon, "Aus, du alter Jorl" led up; behind the church, there was a mountain on top of which there was a dense forest." Freud comments: "the male organ is symbolized by persons and the female by a landscape,"23 while the editor of the Ameri? can translation, A. A. Brill, provides a glossary which equates "church" with vagina, "mountain" with the mons veneris, the "dense forest" with crines pubis, and so forth. What happens through analysis is that the "Wirr und Wildnis" of the image slowly dissipates while the vision of the man's or woman's geni- tals hidden by anamorphosis comes to the fore: the landscape is re? vealed by analysis as a sexual landscape just as, under close examina? tion, Schon's Vexierbild and Joyce's Wake reveal their true nature of 23 S. Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, in Complete Works, Standard Edition (London, 1963), vol. XV, pp. 193-4.</page><page sequence="12">50 sexual landscapes. With Schon, just as with Joyce's Wake, the "peniso- late" peninsulas, "rocks," and "gorges" appear as the composites of genitals or of scatological acts. Thus, the "waters" of Anna Livia reveal their uterine character. Indeed, the Wake may be said to be a "birth of the hero"?the birth of Everyman-Finnegan-Joyce from the uterine flow of words (the actual "wake"). In more than one sense, Joyce is like "the God of Creation," not only "paring his fingernails" behind the scenes, but also engender- ing his own self through the Verb. One feels that there is an obsession with Joyce to be like the Egyptian sun-god "father of himself," or like the God of Spinoza "cause of himself." Here again, Joyce's Finnegan be- longsto the Zeitgeist: let us recall that the Wake was written at about the same time when the Sartrian existentialist man?that man who "makes himself what he is"?was conceived. Finnegans Wake is almost a con? temporary of Le Mur and La Nausee. But for the reader also Finnegans Wake is a "birth of the hero." Insofar as it is a Mannerist landscape or an anamorphic one, the book constitutes for the reader a sort of reversed birth, an "awakening into the dream"?a labyrinthic sexual dream which, like a perfect womb, en- ables him to escape for a while the nightmare of historical reality. In conclusion, it would seem that a combination of two elements constitutes the underlying structure of Finnegans Wake. On the uncon? scious level, Joyce was impregnated with the Judaeo-Christian myths and the Roman Catholic mysteries in which Man, in the image of his God, is a telescopic unification of contradictory elements. And on the conscious level, on the one hand, the Roman Catholic myth received a new content by being fused with the Freudian kaleidoscopic view of Man, while on the other, the encounter with the Mannerist presentation of Man as an anthropomorphic landscape (the revival of the landscape-head during the thirties) provided Joyce with pictorial equiv- alents of his vision and technique for hiding sexual meanings behind topography in a manner similar to that provided both by Freud's Traum- deutung and by anamorphoses.</page></plain_text>
