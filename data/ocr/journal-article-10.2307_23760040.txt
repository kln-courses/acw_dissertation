<plain_text><page sequence="1">Three New Olmec sculptures from southern Veracruz Ann Cy phers Guillén Since 1990, the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán Archaeological Project has been conducting investigations in southern Veracruz, centered on the major Olmec occupation of the San Lorenzo plateau, as well as at several hinterland sites. Among the many new discoveries of the project, three new Olmec sculptures were brought to light in 1992. One cornes from the San Lorenzo plateau itself and the other two from the hinter land. These works of art are important additions to the corpus of known Olmec sculptures for their exceptional beauty and for the associated archaeological context. The purpose of the présent article is to report briefly on the finds and make accurate information available to Mesoamericanists. A New Azuzul Feline The first piece is a large feline sculpture measuring 1.65 m high found on the Azuzul acrópolis, about 4 kilometers south of the San Lorenzo plateau (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Large feline sculpture from the Azulul acrópolis (Height: 165 cm). Discovered during excavations at the site, it was possible to excávate it in situ with regard to architectural features and associated archaeological materials. It is located only a few meters from the three Azuzul sculptures discovered in 1987 by local farmers, which was the focus of a salvage opération conducted by León and Sánchez (1991-1992) (Fig. 2). , * gm Fig. 2. Group of Olmec scupltures discovered by Ignacio Vasconce los in 1987. The sculptured feline at left has a height of 110cm. It is important to clarify that Schnell (1989) inaccurately reported this find as Late Formative and confused the présent positioning of the sculptures with the way they were actually found (Editor's note: In Schnell's original text the date was given as "late Early Formative", in füll agreement with Cy phers. mexicon regrets the accidentai omission of the word "Early"). It is well-known that several stylized forms, such as thrones-altars and colossal heads, are récurrent in Olmec art, yet the Azuzul sculptures now brought to a total of four with the latest discovery are an unparalleled find because they represent the first paired and nearly identical figures sculpted in the round pertaining to this early art style. Even though the identification of felines is sometimes questioned in Olmec art, the Azuzul sculptures clearly repre sent stylized members of the cat family. The new feline, formally very similar to the one discovered in 1987, is 45 cm taller and is correspondingly voluminous. Just as the small feline has been identified as a recarved sculpture (Guillén and Botas, in press), the newest one présents evidence of recarving also; the sculptural form is bound by the rigid constraint of the stone available from the previous phase sculpture. The large feline projects rounded lines as well as well defined ehest musculature, all of which gives it a tremendous feeling of power and strength. When compared to the smaller feline, the detail shown on the face includes a more abstractly represented mouth with less well-defined teeth and finely traced lines on the forehead. It may be possible that a différent cat species is being represented. Yet despite these différences, the overal formal similarities are striking. This includes the body pose, the convention of showing the tail adhering verti cally to the back of the body, and the stilted position of the front legs. In profile, the squeezing of the natural feline form into the defined limits of the volcanic stone is reminiscent of the same feeling of compression that the observer gets from the colossal heads. Following Porter's observation that Monument 53 of San Lorenzo was recarved from an altar-throne (1989), the distortion of normal facial features may have been a consé quence of the recarving process resulting in an effect of flatness. As extraordinary examples of recarved sculptures, the Azuzul felines were designed as naturalistic bodies that had to be compressed stylistically in order to fit within the limits of the available stone. The newly discovered sculpture, as well as the other three, can be presently viewed at the Azuzul site itself where local people have kept them in their custody.</page><page sequence="2">An Anthropomorphic Feline from the San Lorenzo Plateau Recently found eroding down into the Macaya ravine on the southwest part of the San Lorenzo plateau, another new sculpture présents a curious combination of anthropomorphic and feline characteristics (Guillén 1992). An exubérant reclin ing feline-like body shows the previously mentioned conven tion of the tail flattened along the top of the back (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Anthropomorphic feline sculpure from the San Lorenzo plateau (Width: ca. 70cm). The hindquarters of the animal are clearly feline just as are the feet. However, the front quarters, while assuming a somewhat feline pose, are clearly anthropomorphic. Instead of front feet, very large human hands are represented. The ehest is highly developed and prominent and has a human aspect. Viewed from the left side, the lower part of the sculpture shows a heaviness where the Sculptor did not remove excess stone but instead left the stone mass in place in order to achieve a more weighty and stable sculpture. Interesting, in place of a head, the broken area reveáis a flattened surface bounded by with vertical sides, quite similar to the trough stones used in the basait aqueduets on the plateau. Since a number of aqueduet stones were found nearby, it is entirely possible that the piece formed part of an elevated section of aqueduet line. - This sculpture is presently in the safe-keeping of the INAH repré sentative in Tenochtitlan, Veracruz, where a Community mu séum is being built to house the sculptures still located there. It should be noted that the presence of felines in and around the Olmec capital of San Lorenzo is undeniable and pervasive with a total of seven clear feline sculptures represented in the monument corpus, the largest group of known felines repre sented in the Olmec heartland. Highland représentations of felines are outstanding at Chalcatzingo, Morelos, with three previously reported felines depicted in Möns 3 and 4 (Grove and Angulo 1987) and a newly found représentation (Arturo Oliveros, personal communication). A Human Torso from Xochiltepec In November of 1992, a new sculpture was reported from the Xochiltepec ejido which provides new clues about the use of Olmec sculptures (Guillén 1992; 1993). A decapitated and dismembered, but nonetheless magnificent, human torso was recovered about 3.5 kms south of the San Lorenzo plateau (Fig. 4). Elaborately .attired in a fancy woven tie-belt and feathered loincloth, the seated torso wears a spoon-like pecto ral strikingly similar to the jade and jadeite spoons reported from La Venta and other sites. mm 9L w "w? . mmmmmmmm wm mmmmm Fig. 4. Human torso from Xochiltepec (Height: ca. 110cm). Close study of the monument shows that this piece was once a seated figure which had to have been placed upon an elevated surface since its right leg, now broken off, was dangling in front of it. The original posture of the figure was with the left arm raised up high, and the right arm lifted and extended (or ñexed) horizontally in front of the ehest. This posture is quite reminiscent of that of the powerful figure painted in the Oxtotitlan mural, which is seated above the cave mouth (Grove 1973). Slightly inclined backwards, the figure also seems to wear a skirt and a type of sleeveless shirt. The sculptural technique and style (surface finish and line) are very similar to the Azuzul twins as well as to Monuments 1,2, and 3 of Potrero Nuevo, suggesting an Early Formative dating (1200-900 B.C.). - This sculpture may be viewed at the présent time in the Community Museum of the Xochiltepec Ejido, located in the community of Potrero Nuevo, Texistepec municipality, Veracruz.
